1351078036.0,426,self.Xcom,12015s,Dear Firaxis: WTF Were you thinking when you planned the first DLC?,561,135,384,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/12015s/dear_firaxis_wtf_were_you_thinking_when_you/,"I'll keep my list of complaints short and hope one of you sees this.

* A) What people are asking for: randomly raiding alien bases on Earth again, TFTD style underwater missions, more geographically distinct locations in the random map rotation, in short more map variety. Nobody who plays X-Com asked for more story missions, but those are the only type you're adding in the first DLC. Weee. For those who don't get why Story Missions are bad: a lot of people are already complaining about seeing the same maps over and over again. This DLC adds 3 maps that you always play in the same order and are rewarded final tier research and a ""hero"" character for playing. There you go, the carrot is in place, now go play the same 3 maps every time you play XCOM from now on. This is the exact opposite of providing more map variety.

* B) Adding a ""Hero"" NPC is another feature nobody has ever asked for, and frankly goes against the entire point of your soldiers being expendable (though painful to lose). If we wanted to cheat we'd just use your names on our guys, we don't need to pay for the ability. To clarity: this ""hero"" character is a Heavy with upgraded stats compared to your regular recruits or mission rewards agents, therefore you would be silly not to use him.

* C) How is giving early access to the most powerful weapon in the game good for maintaining your ""carefully balanced research system"" ? This goes against your own logic of why you couldn't alter the tech tree by adding new things to it. How about making building labs worthwhile instead?

**This DLC seems like it was designed by someone who has never played XCOM: EU for people who have never played XCOM: EU. Sleeping Dogs: Turn Based Edition Alien Rampage.**

The game is epic and I don't feel disappointed at all with the learning curve present, however I think a few people might be  new to many of the strategic elements.  That said there are quite a few thinks to keep in mind as you progress.  I will not mention anything not present in any demos and will do my best to keep the big spoilers out completely.  I will reference some gear and alien types but other than that these will just be overall suggestions for those of you who are new, or trying the Ironman Classic out the gate and want to know some of the quirks of this version. 

1) Live Aliens are your friend.  They can snowball EVERYTHING  else in the game (See money spoiler).  They give you weapons intact, they give you research bonuses, intact weapons and easier research let you focus on: 

2) Engineers beat Scientists in this game. Engineers run your satellites and make them cheaper, Satellites win you the game. Those country bonuses you think about when selecting your base?  They don't really matter.  If you cover the countries in the continent with Satellites, you get the bonus as if you had a base there.  North America and Africa are synergizing the best in my current game.  However in every... freaking.. game... every...one... Egypt is a nightmare.  Seriously WTF Egypt. 

3) Money Cuts the Rope. There isn't a Laser Cannon racket you can run here. You will be pressed for money at least till mid game.  At that point, if you remember rule number  1&amp;2 ;[You will get delivery pop-ups for X number of Y weapons, it seems that after mutons these are Plasma and Laser weapons.  These requests are always a huge profit.  Much more so if you've been been getting these items off the aliens as opposed to manufacturing them.  I've had a few Plasma rifles or Plasma pistol offers at about 3k.  This influx is huge and lets you snowball.](/spoiler)

4)The game will tell you what sell on the grey market.  The game will clearly state what is harmless to sell.  That said [Don't sell Alloys, you'll need them.  Weapon fragments are somewhat safe mid/late game and if you budget Elerium sales can get you out of a bind.](/spoiler)

5) When selecting missions: 5th Red Bar &gt; Engineers &gt; Scientists &gt; Recruit (Capt. or Higher imo) &gt; Money &gt; Recruit

6) I'm actually not using a foundry this game.  The refunding and Shiv's are nice, but I don't like how they don't advance as well, and they're pricey when I could be buying Sats.  No trolling, but I see some serious potential with the pistol line of research though. 

7) As far as tactics, I think this will actually be the easiest part of most people.  For me: 2 Assaults every mission, they're supposed to fall off, but I haven't seen it.  At higher levels supports are also a force.  I really don't find my heavies doing that much, and my sniper is mostly just overwatch. I tend to recruit Zerg the UFO and Terror Missions. Abuduction missions I use to level up my better troops as they're fairly linear. Any escort or VIP mission will be a gear check.  Seriously they are beast.  The easiest might be the bomb ones and that's only because you eventually hard counter poison. 

8) Just to note, in the left hand corner by your troops name, that Star... that's your Squad leader don't let him die changes per mission, usually your highest ranking or most mission dude.

9) F1 while your soldier is selected will tell you your current bonuses or penalties in combat.  You can quick view this with a small ^ next to your soldier on screen.  Green=Good, Red=Bad. 

10) Last, do not disassemble your Officer Training once the research is completed.  Seriously this was huge and at a truly dangerous time, totally caused my previous attempt to wipe..  If you destroy it you will lose all the abilities it provides, you don't lose the research if you rebuild it, but if it's gone you're back to squad size 4 and other problems.

I will add any pointers that people think are valid, I was just trying to go about it in a vague way without blantanting saying ""Do this, do that""

Questions:

1) Has anyone noted if game progression is time based, or event based?  [I.E. Do Heavy Floaters only show after you capture Sectoid commanders/Base raid, or is it time based?](/spoiler) ",,False,self,t5_2si6x,1349859891.0,,Snakeman,True,t3_118soq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/118soq/10_tips_and_tricks_minimal_spoilers/,
1350150307.0,202,self.Xcom,11f77q,XCOM Rookie Advice,224,22,242,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/11f77q/xcom_rookie_advice/,"It's obvious that many people in this thread are veterans of XCOM.  I figured I'd start a small thread with advice for newer rookies to XCOM to help you survive the invasion.  I'd appreciate if other veterans would lend their experience as well!

1.) Understand the roles of your soldiers and their abilities -
Smoke grenades are absolutely amazing for providing cover when the environment doesn't.  Run and Gun is great for taking out aliens in bad positions or to get to something that absolutely has to die.  A well placed rocket or two can take out grouped up aliens with ease.  The point is you need to think beyond the soldier themselves and utilize their strenghts.

2.) Cover.  Few things are as important to your soldiers well being as cover.  As you approach an area you'll see a shield.  If the shield is filled in fully it provides good cover.  If it is half full then it is partial cover.  You can still maintain a line of site to your enemies.  There are VERY few situations where you want your soldiers to not be behind cover of some sort.  Understand too that your cover can be destroyed and the enemy WILL exploit this.  Always have your next move planned.

3.) Positioning.  This ties in with the first two things.  You will want your sniper in areas with great vision over the field.  They have a long range and you can trait away the overwatch penalty.  I like to keep my support at mid range to access any soldier quickly with a med kit, to have a variety of targets for supressing fire, and to be in range to cover people with smoke.  I like heavies up front with assaults on the wings.  Armored heavies can be more resilient against melee attacks and often will be the first to reveal enemies making rockets more useful while they are grouped.  Assaults have run and gun which is ideal for a quick flank to force the enemy to reposition instead of fire on you.

4.) Flanking is a matter of when, not if.  You should always attempt to flank the enemy because they will be attempting to flank you.  Thinking ahead on this will allow you to set up great ambushes on flanking paths so that as they move around you already have someone waiting to cut them off.  If you get pinned down the enemy will likely start trying to access your flank...be prepared for this and have a soldier watching your back out of the main firefight.

5.) Overwatch.  Everyone should know this but you can end your turn in the blue radius and still activate overwatch.  This enables you to take a shot at enemies who move in to your line of site when its the aliens turn to move.  This is ESSENTIAL.  I find much more success by moving slow and allowing all soldiers to be on overwatch than by sprinting ahead and being caught with your pants down in close proximity to newly discovered aliens.

6.) PATIENCE.  Nothing kills you faster in this game than by rushing without a plan.  From the first steps off of the sky ranger your priorities should be to get cover, position your people where you want them (snipers in overwatch, assaults on the outsides, etc), then advance orderly covering each others movements.  The guy who sprints blindly into yellow will be the first to get killed.

7.) When possible, capture the enemy.  It isn't always easy, but you get big bonuses by capturing enemies and allowing your scientists to interrogate them.  It is dangerous but if you suspect that you are down to your final alien on the map, taking a few extra turns to set up a capture might be better than the quick kill.

8.) Keep a little cash and supply on hand unless you are in dire straights.  Being able to take advantage of an opportunity to craft 3 weapons for a huge profit are great ways to get a boost.  If you run yourself dry, you might miss a chance to make quick money.

9.) YOU WILL NOT KEEP UP WITH DEMAND - This is important.  Squaddies are going to die from time to time.  Panic will spread.  Your enemy has better technology, and better tactics from the begining.  You are the underdog and you need to take losses in stride.  This game isn't the one where you roll in and never lose anyone.  The scenarios are interesting and forces difficult decisions.  Don't get frustrated by this...it's half of the fun!

The first thing to know about playing through the game on Ironman Impossible difficulty is to forget everything you think you know about X-COM. I've gone on record in the past as having said that X-COM has always been a game about ""mitigating damage"" and ""loss prevention"".  The fact of the matter is that when you play the game on this setting that a lot of people are going to die no matter what you do, so you have to think about how you approach the game a little differently. 

While it IS possible to lose the game in a tactical setting, the biggest difficulty is the strategic setting. You have to beat XCOM before XCOM beats you, and Impossible difficulty is intended to beat you. For this reason you have to take into consideration that *TIME* is your most valuable resource. Not weapons fragments. Not Elerium. Not scientists or engineers. Time. 

So let's talk about the strategic aspect of the game first.

For starters, build your base in South America for the “We Have Ways” bonus. The fact that you'll be able to instantly perform interrogations and autopsies will give you added research bonuses quickly so that you can focus your efforts more on hunting down engineers to build Firestorms than hunting down scientists to research new weapons and armor. Those weapons will come, but you NEED to have that Firestorm available to you as well as enough resources to produce them on your continents. 

During the early portions of the game, focus on having enough power in your base to produce enough Satellite Uplinks to cover as much of the globe as possible, but don't launch your satellites.  When abductions happen on Impossible you can expect the countries you DON'T send the Skyranger to to go into full blown panic after your successful mission elsewhere. Even if they only had a minimal amount of panic to begin with. Don't let this panic you! 

When you launch a satellite it will lower the panic of the country you launch it in. This works to your benefit. You need to intentionally ignore the countries that you WANT to launch satellites in right off the bat.  I intentionally ignore all of Africa during the first 1-2 months of gameplay so that those countries go into panic and I can launch enough satellites in Africa to get the “All In” bonus and increase my monthly income by 30%. 

ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS visit your Situation Room right before the end of the month to launch satellites into countries that are in a panic – you may not have enough satellites or uplinks to do it all the time but make sure that you make satellite coverage a primary focus of your strategic gameplay because you can lose Impossible difficulty very quickly if you don't.

Reserve your Alien Base Assault until you absolutely NEED to do it in order to either progress the storyline or, more likely, to lower worldwide panic by 2 in every country. I recommend launching the assault when you have countries in panic at the end of the month that you already have satellite coverage in.

Research is an interesting thing when it comes to Impossible difficulty. Remember that I said that time is your most valuable asset... but you have neither enough time nor enough resources to research all the things that you want to have.  This is a nice time to start transitioning this discussion toward the tactical setting.

Snipers are fantastic in XCOM Enemy Unknown. Guess what? You don't need them on Impossible difficulty.  The aliens will always outnumber you, always outmaneuver you, and always have way more health and damage mitigation than you have. You can NOT play Impossible from the traditional X-COM defensive perspective.

I only use snipers during the beginning portions of the game kind of like throw-away red shirt away team peons. By the time you can start researching Precision Lasers you can safely dismiss all of your Snipers. 

Why? Because Impossible difficulty's tactical setting needs to be ATTACKED AGGRESSIVELY,  not approached carefully. My typical squad consists of 3 Assaults, 2 Heavies, and 1 Support. You need to be able to put enough shots into the aliens before they put enough shots into you. Assume that every Muton you see wants to land a grenade right on your entire squad. DON'T LET THEM. Assault and Heavy classes get the ability to attack twice per turn at a very low rank versus Snipers who get Double Tap at the Colonel rank. They won't live long enough to make it to Colonel rank, bottom line.

The added benefit to ignoring the Sniper class means that you can leave out Precision Laser research, Plasma Pistol research, Plasma Sniper Rifle research, and even Archangel Armor research. Not only does this free up a lot of resources used in the research process, but you don't have to construct any of these weapons which leaves you more resources to build things like Firestorms and Plasma cannons.

On every mission with the exception of the final mission I took two officers (Lieutenant, Captain, never more than ONE Major if need be), two enlisted (Sergeant, Corporal), and two newbies (Squadie, Rookie). People are gonna die, and you can't afford to put all your eggs in one basket. Eventually certain soldiers will distinguish themselves and your Captains may become Majors and those Majors may be fortunate enough to become Colonels. 

Save your Colonels to take ALL of them on the final mission. As soon as the Gollup Chamber becomes available you want to have one of those Colonels fitted with a Psi Armor and ready to go – Whichever 'gifted' Colonel you send to use the Gollup Chamber is automatically granted all available ranks of Psionic skill, so don't feel the need to drag a Colonel through mission after mission just so they can level up their Psionic ability.

The most important thing is to stick to the 2 officer, 2 enlisted, 2 newbie concept so even while you're trying to progress some vets toward the higher ranks you still have new blood rolling through the door just in case all hell breaks loose.

Every Assault soldier needs to have their double shot ability and every Heavy should take Heat Ammo. I know you'll miss out on some nice perks by taking these but once you start running in to Cyberdiscs, Sectopods, Chryssalids, and Ethereals you'll understand why you need an overwhelming show of force. 

Heavy plasma with heat ammo reigns supreme during the final missions of XCOM on Impossible difficulty. 

Final mission spoiler: [And having three Assault soldiers Run &amp; Gun into the room with the final Ethereal Commander and blow him to pieces with their double shot abilities before anyone even has a chance to react to it is absolutely priceless.](/spoiler)

---------


I'm going to cover a bunch of stuff in this post, but I'm going to start with Overwatch and using it properly. This is because Overwatching correctly is one of the most fundamentally important parts of playing this game on Classic and Impossible and the aliens will destroy you every single time if you don't do it right.

**What is Overwatch?**

Just so we're on the same page, Overwatching is the act of having your soldier reaction fire on any enemy that makes a move action within their field of view. Overwatch shots cannot crit, are made at an Aim penalty, and the Overwatcher must have line-of-sight on the victim. Overwatch shots do not trigger on any action except for movement. Choosing to Overwatch ends your soldier's turn entirely, regardless of how many actions they had left. I'll interchangeably refer to Overwatch shots as reaction fire.

**I know that and I use it all the time, what's the problem?**

The using it all the time is the problem. Its a common refrain in this thread that should always end your turn on Overwatch and that's a false statement that will result in the death of a lot of soldiers. This is because of something incredibly, unbelievably important that the game does not directly tell you:

*An alien that knows it is being Overwatched will not move for any reason* (Short of panic). This is for the same reason that you try to avoid moving when you're being Overwatched: the AI doesn't want to give you the free shot and potential kill. However, a human player has the capacity to judge the risk of taking reaction fire against other potential risks, like being flanked or a car about to explode. The AI does not. Again, if the AI knows a unit is being Overwatched, it will not move that unit under any circumstance. Instead, it will fire at one of your units. On unmodded Classic, this is super-bad because the aliens receive bonuses to their Aim and Crit chance, meaning their chances of hitting and killing one of your soldiers is significantly higher.

This is why you are fucking up using Overwatch. By always choosing to Overwatch if you can't think of anything else, you are essentially forcing the AI to make more shots on your soldiers, significantly increasing the chance of those soldiers dying.

**So Overwatch is useless then.**

No, Overwatch still has two primary uses:

1)The AI in XCOM is not omnipotent. If it doesn't have line-of-sight on you, it legitimately does not know where you are and what you are doing (This appears to extend even further than a human player's lack of knowledge in that the AI doesn't seem to cohesively use all of its units' vision, meaning that the AI might move Sectoid A into an Overwatching soldier's LOS even though Sectoid B already had LOS on the Overwatcher). This means the AI will walk into Overwatch fire if the Overwatcher was in the fog of war. This is why, when you are in the initial scouting phase, you should be ending every turn on Overwatch in case an alien pack runs into view. This is also useful for Overwatch traps, where you pull your soldiers back, Overwatch them, then let Muton Berserkers charge in and get fucked up by a criss-crossing plasma disco.

2) The refusal of the AI to move while it is Overwatched is as much as a risk to them as it is a risk to you. This means they won't shift out of half-cover, they won't run from being flanked, and they won't move from an exploding car. Using Overwatch is a way of 'fixing' an alien in place if that alien is in an advantageous place for you or if you are moving soldiers to flank it. Keep in mind that the pinned alien will continue to shoot at your people, so make sure that the potential gain of pinning it is higher than the potential risk of injury or death. Its honestly better to use Suppression for this particular use.

**I'm a goon, break it down into bullet points**

- Overwatch when you are scouting and not certain what you'll run into.
- Overwatch when you want to keep an alien pinned down to flank it/shoot it/whatever.
- Overwatch when you know the AI doesn't have LOS on you and thus doesn't know what you're doing.
- DO NOT Overwatch if you will gain nothing from this alien's current position. Either take the shot if its &gt;40% or Hunker Down.
- AVOID Overwatching while in half-cover. Half-cover is not hugely useful on Classic and it is almost always better to Hunker Down than doing anything else.

People who say you should always end by Overwatching are straight-up wrong. I followed that particular advice and was losing 1+ soldiers every mission. When I learned how the AI responded to Overwatch and began thinking about my use of it in that context, I started using it a lot less while using Hunker Down or taking shots I wouldn't have taken before. Abruptly, I start winning more missions with no casualties. Overwatch is a very powerful ability when used correctly and its is an anchor around your neck if you use it without thought.",,False,self,t5_2si6x,False,,,True,t3_11tu86,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/11tu86/overwatch_and_you_or_how_you_are_fucking_up/,

* More council mission types.

* A game editor so people could build their own maps / missions.

You added:

There is no evidence for it, other than anecdotal evidence and bad math done by people who clearly don't understand statistics. Here are some links to convince you that against all odds, the game is actually not lying to you when it says willpower matters(funny how that happens)

Finally, if you still don't believe me, a simple test anyone can recreate a lot faster than trying to test lots of soldiers to get statistical significance with small percentages(hint: for a valid test, you need to test a lot of soldiers, and need to test a lot of high will soldiers) : set PSI_GIFT_CHANCE to 1, and then test and reload over and over with a 100 will soldier and a rookie. The 100 will soldier will psi every time. The rookie will get psi roughly 40% of the time.

Now march forth, and fry alien minds with your newly gained psi powers.

Also, fwiw, this really shouldn't change how you play the game, it's still easier to test 20 squaddies and get 2-3 psi and train them up than it is to train up 10 colonels and get 2-3 psi",,False,self,t5_2si6x,False,,,True,t3_13fekh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/13fekh/psi_probability_is_affected_by_will_the_formula/,

Just to add to the now-growing list of tips and tricks for those playing the game now, here are some I've learned (some the extremely painful, game-ending hard way), and a couple of stuff I discovered about the endgame that I really wished I knew.

* The obvious part about focusing on satelites and workshops in the early game? Its vital in Classic, but not so much on Impossible. Impossible is more about working with extremely curtailed resources. Be as frugal with your resources (and I mean all of them, from alien alloys to X-Com operatives) as possible, and be as fast as possible. Time is very much a short resouce in an Impossible game.

* Get a Foundry up (Experimental Warfare research) as soon as you can. You want this up as soon as you start seeing Thin Men. Research autopsies on these and quickly Foundry up Improved Medkits. Your men will thank you, and so will your sanity.

* Only one Laboratory. Seriously. Focus on Workshops instead. Get two if you simply cant wait on research, but no more.

* If you can skip Beam Weapons and go straight to Plasma, do it. No exceptions on higher difficulties.

* Skeleton Suit is a nice upgrade to Carapace, provided you stick to cover as much as possible. Grapple ability with high sight-lines available to you means that you get to exploit height bonuses quite a bit. Normally I'd only suggest giving this to the snipers, but I've also gained quite a bit when I give them to my supports as well, since they shoot just as well as the snipers.

* Dont bring a whole team of Colonels to a small scout UFO crash. If ever, you only ever need one, to lead the team and keep him/herself alive so the rookies (you did remember to bring some to level up, right? *RIGHT*?) dont panic and shoot themselves in the foot. Colonels are for big missions, like the alien base, or a crashed battleship...

* Titan Armor is great and all, but you really want Ghost armor. Why? +3 move, +20 defense (which directly translates to 20% less chance of being hit), can grapple, and can stealth 4x. Can you imagine the level of butthurt you can pull with a fully-steathed team not triggering an alien spawn, then have someone drop stealth with the rest of the team in overwatch, have multiple reaction shots (with the stealth drop +crit), and if you set it up right, use the Assault's Close Combat Specialist perk.

* **Assault:** Ghost armor these guys, pick Close Combat Specialist (free reaction shot vs aliens within 4 tiles that move), add a couple of +crit perks if you want, and sneak these guys into an alien spawn that hasnt ""activated"". Drop steath. Watch the minor action cutscene of them noticing your guy, and watch them start to move. Oh, wait, they're dead now, cause your Assault just reaction-shot all of them in the FACE with a shotgun. This is called the Assault Bomb for a reason ;)

* **Heavy:** Extra grenades may prove more useful than you think, compared to more AoE range for rockets/suppression. Unless you have a Suppression-heavy Heavy, and utilize it quite a bit, go for the extra grenades.

* **Heavy/SHIV:** You do know you can offload Suppression duties to a SHIV, right? Higher-end SHIV's become insanely useful especially when psi troops show up, becoming both eyes and claws vs psi troops. Arm those SHIVs with laser or higher-end weaponry and they'll kill that target's cover too...

* **Heavy:** You know that Shredder Missile ability? It doesnt use your normal rocket shot. Its essentially an extra rocket that does less damage, but adds a very nice damage resistance debuff, very useful on higher difficulties. It also destroys cover, which leads to...

* **Sniper:** In The Zone makes it so kills on targets *not in cover* or *are flanked* are FREE moves. Heavy Shreds a group of 3-4, blows their cover, Sniper in the back (you did pick Squad Sight, right? *RIGHT*?) nails them all in a single turn. Awesome synergy. (Sidenote: you only get 1 shot on a pistol but In The Zone works as intended if you can shoot your sniper rifle).

* **Sniper:** Disabling Shot may prove to be VITAL not only in capture scenarios, but when one of your guys is mind-controlled, making them waste a turn (and not hurting them much if you kept up on armor) as you disable their weapon. This has proven to be vital for me in Classic games to the point of ignoring the equally-awesome Battle Scanner. I currently ignore Battle Scanner mainly because of the really annoying bug of it landing underneath the ground, nullifying its sight.

* **Heavy:** Extra rockets is always awesome (Rocketeer), unless (again) you are playing and using a Suppression Heavy. (Mayhem)

* **Support:** Even if you are not intending for a specific Support to be the assigned Medic, he/she will eventually be able to carry a second inventory item, so you might as well make them capable of healing when you need to. (Field Medic)

* **Support:** Revive is awesome and all, but Rifle Suppression (with energy, cover-destroying weapons) may trump it. If you are having to rely on Revive, you already screwed up somewhere massively.

* **Support:** You know Combat Drugs in the wonderful magic smoke they can eventually pop down? Thats a + to Crit and Will. + to Will. That means less likely to be mind-controlled right there. Let your guys get high on success (or just get high on magic smoke, w/e. /r/trees anyone?)

* You know that bit after finishing off the Alien Base? Dont research it until you get some better interceptors out on the field. Trust me on this.

* Psionics. This is another reason why you save your Colonels. They already have high Will from leveling up (Will being the basis of Psionics). Send 3 of them into the lab (WITHOUT THEIR GEAR, ELSE THAT GEAR IS LOCKED OUT FOR THE DURATION), and hope for the best. Dont send rookies in with low Will, thats just counterproductive. Granted Psi-capable troops are rare to begin with, but activating psi on a Colonel means that its a tough soldier to start off with, capable of handling itself as it levels up its psi capabilities.

I hope someone is writing all of these down so that we can have a repository of tips/tricks for newcomers to X-Com to read :D

EDIT: Additionals follow here

* /u/creepy_doll and /u/MisuVir note that you can still grab the Psi tested soldier's gear via the Barracks.
* /u/creepy_doll notes that its better to cap not for captives, but for their weapons and gear.
* /u/MouthSouth notes that you can have a Squad-Sight-based sniper overwatch with the sniper rifle after a move. Simply overwatch with the pistol, reselect him, and swap his weapon to the rifle. Next enemy turn, Sniper will be overwatching with the rifle.

I've spent my whole weekend playing it and completely ignored all the plans that I had. =)
But we are sensible grown up people and it is safe to admit that game is not ideal. So here is my list of things I hate about the game. Feel free to add yours in comments.



1. Camera. Oh my god how I hate camera in this game. The person responsible for camera should be tortured the same way he tortures us with this piece of sh... On a multilevel UFO I want to swear loudly, that is how horrible it is. Why the camera goes parallel to the ground when you move to the edge of the screen is still beyond my understanding. Horrible usability.



2. I think the main drawback in terms of gameplay in this game is the lack of friendly fire (except for AoE damage). No more accidentally killed soldiers and aliens (my favourite). Also it's a pain to capture a controlled alien now. You have to move him somewhere safe, wait for control to end and then pray that he won't kill your guy with a stunner in his one turn.



3. The process of assigning soldier's equipment gets second prize in ""the most horrible usability"". Why would the soldiers keep their items on themselves when they are in barracks? Are they really walking the base in that Titan Armour with a heavy plasma on their shoulders? At least they remove the items from wounded soldiers, but not from those undergoing psi training. Only in the very end of the game I've realised that you can remove items from soldiers in psi training when you access them from barracks, you can't from the equipment before mission screen.



4. Why can't I shoot in a random direction? That is ridiculous! I don't want to go over the corner of a building because there is an alien standing there. I want to shoot the wall and walk inside from completely unexpected direction. Such a limitation in terms of tactics.

I just want to share a story. Tonight, XCOM provided me with the most incredible time I have ever had in my gaming career.

I'm playing Normal Ironman, and I was pretty broke and Egypt had a high panic level and offered 200 credits for an abduction mission. Hell yes.

Oh no. All of my good squad was injured from the last mission except for a new Heavy. I had her and a team of four rookies. As I geared up the squad, I figured this would be interesting. But I had no idea just how interesting it would be.

Two squad members had med packs, one of which was named Andrea. The other two had a frag and an arc thrower. Upon landing, I immediately began maneuvering my squad into the construction zone. This mission was supposed to be hard, so I was moving inches at a time until I found a single sectoid. I quickly dispatched him with the Heavy. ""This isn't so bad"", I thought to myself foolishly.

 And then all hell broke loose the next turn. All. Fucking. Hell.

Four more sectoid come into range. Then three floaters. Then two thin men on the roof of a building. It seemed like a never ending flow of assholes was pouring from the sky. At this point, I knew I was fucked. The last mission was full of experienced soldiers and half this many aliens and they still all came out injured. 

I lost two rookies in one turn. They were fairly close to each other and were flanked by four sectoids. It was at this point that I realized I might have to abort. But I didn't.

My Heavy took out a floater. Two rookies dispatched the other two floaters and a thin man. Then the sectoids began to fall under LMG fire. And then, just as I was getting my hopes up, a rookie was hit heavily and panicked. He ran out of cover, tried to shoot at an alien, and was slaughtered. It was just my Heavy with her SCOPE, and Andrea the Rookie with a single medkit. They were spread out on either side of the entrance. I told myself I'd be fine. And then, just as I moved my Heavy to avoid being flanked by a sectoid, I remembered the thin men on the roof.

My Heavy fell. She fell hard. And then the fire focused on Andrea, who was left with 1 HP. I used up her only medkit and prayed that she wouldn't be run up on after healing.

I didn't have visuals anymore, so I ran around the back of the building. I found an entrance to attempt to flank the thin men from, but I knew better. I positioned her to the side of it and put her into overwatch.

A sectoid came up on her from around the other side of the building, but he missed his shots. A thin man ran near the entrance on the inside as well, but moved deeper into the building. I moved her back around a corner and put her into overwatch once more.

That sectoid ate lead like a bitch. The second he moved, he was laid flat on the ground. The thin man came into view again and then ran deeper in still. So I moved her to her old cover at the back entrance of the building. 

Three turns she was fired at by the thin man. Three turns his shots missed. And then he was dead. The RNG gods must have felt bad, because I was definitely lucky there.

I wasn't sure how many were left, but there were noises coming from the center of the construction yard - straight through the building. Andrea waited in overwatch until finally she had eyes on a sectoid. Her shots missed. His did not. She panicked.

And what did Andrea the Panicked Rookie with 1 HP do? She stepped out of her cover and blew that fucking sectoid straight to hell.

And then the mission ended.

1350338522.0,104,self.Xcom,11j97h,"Rose-Tinted Glasses Off, A Comparison of Old vs. New",130,26,175,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/11j97h/rosetinted_glasses_off_a_comparison_of_old_vs_new/,"Having played about 40 hours of new XCOM I feel like now is the time to record my initial impressions before I get cranky and start sucking old X-Com's dick like a lot of people here have been.

There are some completely ridiculous complaints about the new X-Com as opposed to the old that I've seen a few times, and I'd like to start by addressing them:

&gt; 1) Weapon choices are too linear and limited

This could be true (compared to other games that aren't the original X-Com), but I see people saying this about old X-Com vs. new XCOM @_@ This is insane, the original had no variety at all. You just rushed Plasma Rifles and Heavy Plasma on all your mans, and there were not even Shotgun / Sniper / LMG / Rifle variants at each tech level. Not only that, the Heavy Laser in old X-Com was widely panned as being completely terrible, so early-mid game you would literally use nothing but Laser Rifles. For Plasma, Heavy was slightly less accurate, but you could snipe with 100% accuracy from across the map with it anyway if your agent had developed his aim well enough. Basically the only reason you would keep P. Rifles around were for your guys with shitty aim stat, it was a sub-optimal weapon. As well, though you had some more choices in early game gear, they were all basically terrible and made obsolete by Laser Rifles. The new class-based weapon system is far superior, as are the weapons themselves.

&gt; 2) The TU system was better

This is utter bullshit. The current system SEEMS very limiting at first, but you get lots of ways to game it as your soldiers rank up. Assaults immediately get to flaunt the rules with Run &amp; Gun (move twice and shoot), and eventually laugh at them with Rapid Fire(move and then shoot twice!). Heavies get their own ability that lets them shoot twice in one turn, Medics get to run extra far compared to other classes, etc...

The new time system is elegant, easy to understand, and despite the simplicity of it, it allows for all 4 of the classes to feel very different. You can't consider the time system in a vacuum, calling it worse than TUs without considering how it ties in with your agent's classes and how their interaction forces you to use all your agents differently. This is a HUGE improvement over the old X-Com where everyone was essentially the same once you had flying armor + heavy plasma on your entire team.

&gt; 3) I can't free aim with all my weapons

Yes, it made you feel very clever the first time you realized you could blow up the alien's cover on purpose with a gun then shoot them with another guy immediately afterwards in the original X-Com, but it was not a game defining feature, and frankly once your accuracy was high enough you could go Automatic and destroy the cover + get the kill with 1 guy anyway just by shooting directly at the alien. It just wouldn't work in this game, the skills and abilities are not tuned for that possibility, and if the aliens could do it on purpose too (and why wouldn't they, if you could?) you would be completely fucked since they all have Plasma all game long. As well, the designers DID allow you to do this, almost certainly intentionally, by giving you rockets (or at least grenades) from the very first mission. They just knew that giving you or the aliens the ability to do it without any restrictions would break the game.

&gt; 4) Interceptor combat sucks now

Ship combat was never very interesting, and without a fan patch it was actually a little buggy since your guys would fly away after firing their last salvo (but before it had a chance to actually hit the UFO, oops!). It is certainly not a strong point in new XCOM, but it was never really better than it is now. As well, in the old X-com you were able to completely obliterate ships in the air accidentally (not just down them), and you would hardly ever WANT to do that because you would then forfeit all the materials you could have nabbed by going to the crash site. Again it was a micro-intensive detail that was more annoying to deal with than anything. Same with being able to down ships over water and not being able to recover them, more annoying than a ""feature"".

**Now then, for stuff I think is freaking awesome about the new XCOM:**

* Unlimited Ammo + Pistols

Not having to micro-manage ammo clips is so freaking awesome. Everyone carrying a side-arm that never needs reloaded is also awesome. Snipers being able to pull one out, get bonus damage and fight while moving without the perk for their rifle is awesome. Assaults with Shotguns getting a somewhat reliable medium range weapon (again, that never needs reloaded) to Overwatch plink with, also awesome. In case you don't remember, in the original X-Com you not only had to buy / find / make / research clips, you had to manually put them on your Skyranger, then manually equip them to all 12 of your agents before every mission. It was a chore, and added nothing to the fun of the game. I'm glad modern XCOM agents are finally smart enough to realize they need to bring enough ammo along with their guns without the Commander personally making sure they didn't forget it along with their lunchbox and homework.

* Agents / Classes

Yeah I mentioned this already, but the classes (and their class-specific weapons) are freaking great. It can be annoying not getting the classes you wanted out of your rookies, but hey, at least their stats aren't random. That is a huge Agent improvement over the original, where you could spend money and time hiring new rookies only to find out they were utterly shit and would serve as nothing better than plasma-fodder when you needed a UFO door opened. Now that you only get 6 agents, you can't afford to bring along red shirts, so that means there is literally no use for agents with sub-optimal stats. Speaking of only 6 agents, great decision! Sometimes I find even with just 6 that having to cycle all of them into Overwatch multiple turns in a row gets tedious, but at least it isn't 12. A more focused tactical experience where your agents ALL matter, not just some of them, is much more intense. Agent skills while ranking up are GREAT and really make them feel MUCH more powerful as they gain experience.

* The new Time System

I've already explained why I like the new time system if you read the above stuff. I'll summarize here: It is elegant, easy to understand, and interacts well with another major new game system: the agent classes.

* The new Weapons / Armor / Tech Progression

Huge fan of the new class specific weapons, because just like the class abilities themselves, they force you to use different agents in different ways to get the maximum effectiveness out of them. Yeah, Shotguns suck at long range, but they do incredible damage with perfect accuracy up close. They complement your Close Combat Specialist and Run &amp; Gun skills perfectly. Same with other classes and their skills, like say a Sniper who took Squadsite and Gunslinger. They can compensate for their lowered damage on the move and close range inaccuracy somewhat by having a powerful Pistol equipped, especially if you do the Foundry pistol upgrades and use a SCOPE.

**Things I Do Not Like:**

* I do not like that you can only send out 1 team at a time and there is only ever 1 event going on at a time. 

I don't care for the Abduction missions, because you lose even when you win them (panic goes up in 2 locations, down in 1). As someone else had mentioned, in the original X-Com the aliens had their own agenda and you were reacting to it as much as you were trying to contain it. That feeling of fighting an implacable foe that begins to strike more and more frequently with stronger forces, all over the world, is gone. I don't like that enemy base raids are gone, they were a staple of the late game and particularly harrowing due to their 2-stage nature. Having mentioned double-stages, I miss them. I don't mind how small some of these maps are, it focuses the action and forces you to use different tactics than you would on a larger map, but I do think (especially now that ammo is unlimited) it would have been lovely being able to do 2-part alien base raids in the new game.

* I do not like that the X-Box controller does not allow you to issue weapon swap / open door / de-activate bomb commands after dashing / shooting / Overwatching.

The Mouse + Keyboard does, so they both should let you! I stopped using my X-Box controller after realizing this flaw in the control scheme. Amazing that they got it so close to being perfect and left this obvious error in. Then again, if the PC version being able to do this is a bug or an oversight, they should patch it out of Mouse + Keyboard so that there is no in-game advantage to using one control scheme over the other. It would hurt, sure, but as it is there is an obvious advantage PC players have over console players imo.

* I do not like having to watch the ""We see you!"" animation every time an alien group spots you.

Seriously, after the first few per species there should be an internal counter that disables them, or a menu option that just lets you disable them entirely. Just like the glam cam can be disabled.

* I do think Classic mode has one major balance issue

Panic increases far too quickly. You can win every mission and still lose countries by the end of the 2nd month, which basically forces you to focus on expanding Satellite coverage (thus eliminating other game opening macro-level strategic choices that are available in other modes). I don't think you should be guaranteed to never lose countries, but if you've won every mission it is pretty dickish to lose countries when you weren't even given the option to do missions in the panicking countries before they defect.

* I do not like how easily your soldiers can panic

They should have been given (temporary) bonus Will for each alien killed instead of just losing Will when they get spit on by a Thin Man and losing their shit. If the mission begins with your team leader getting his head blown off before you kill any aliens, I don't see a problem with a panic-induced death-spiral. Once you've killed 6-10 of the buggers though it should be obvious to even your rookies that the enemy is far from invincible human-eating monstrosities.",,False,self,t5_2si6x,1350380981.0,,,True,t3_11j97h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/11j97h/rosetinted_glasses_off_a_comparison_of_old_vs_new/,

**Preface**: I generally start Africa for +30% income. This is fundamental to my playstyle of Satellite and Uplink rushing.

**First**: Do not build your first satellite before your first panic mission. Everyone I've seen will build an immediate $100 satellite at the start of the game and not use it. If you wait until after your first terror mission and take Engineer rewards, your satellite cost will drop dramatically (In this case I believe it went to something like $66) enabling you to build up to three or four satellites in the first month alone.

**Second**: You do not need alien containment to capture Outsiders and they are the single easiest thing to capture in the game - Their first turn is spent rushing to your team to attempt a flank making them easy, safe captures. I rushed the Arc Thrower and captured the first Outsider I could get my hands on. Bang - Instant plasma research. Rush this. Rush it hard.

**Third**: Abuse panic to capture and specially train your troops. An enemy that is under overwatch by any troop and flanked by any troop will USUALLY panic. This allows you to dominate the battlefield. In some missions I'd have 3 or 4 active groups of sectoids. Eventually I'd flank EVERYONE, rearrange and try to get ONE free soldier who can kill while everyone else overwatches to induce panic. I'd then farm up kills to get everyone ranked up as fast as possible and as evenly as possible as well as enable 100% safe Arc Thrower captures.

**Fourth**: Learn scenarios in which enemies will break panic and act. Thin Men tend to spit poison if there's anyone not immune in LoS and Mutons + co. will throw grenades if anyone in range is behind destructible cover or they can hit two people with one grenade. I even had a sectoid take a shot at near point-blank against a full health soldier while two sectoids next to him paniced, making me believe that if you have a solider with a sufficiently high percent chance to be hit (Say, 100% from being in basically melee range) shots will still be taken.

**Fifth**: There are only three captures you need to make, minus plot.

* The Slingshot DLC guarantees a VERY EARLY capture that broke the entire game for me - Muton. As part of the Slingshot DLC, on Impossible the first Slingshot mission (And by extension, the first council mission you go on) will spawn a Muton near the end. Combined with the guaranteed and scripted nature of the spawns, this is one of the safest Mutons you'll be able to capture. Interrogation gives a VERY EARLY Plasma research credit. Don't even bother to research laser weapons past standard laser rifles.  
* Early UFO missions will eventually net you a Berserker. These a VERY easy captures as they are straightforward to manipulate and they come charging at you. Armor research credit.  
* The hardest will be a Heavy Floater for flight credit. This is optional, but if you get lucky (Occasionally a heavy floater will come right into your team for a flank) you can shave massive time off Firestorm research.  
As such - ""We Have Ways"" is one of the worse continent bonuses to get. You're not aiming to research EVERYTHING, only what you need to complete the game.

**Sixth**: Medikits are God on council missions. Put one on EVERYBODY. Not many people seem to realise that Medikits infer immunity to poison. This allows you to pull Operation Bullshit Panic Flank on enemy Thin Men as if they were bigger, more accurate sectoids. This means more chances to capture, easier kills and lower risk of actually ever being shot at.

**Seventh**: Equipment is on-site procurement for weapons. Early on, light plasma rifles are incredible - Offering a + accuracy over laser rifles for equivalent damage. They're easy to get. You'll generally get two or three standard plasma rifles before you've completed the research. You'll generally have one or two heavy plasma rifles before you've completed the research. DO NOT MAKE ANY OF THESE WEAPONS. CAPTURE THEM ONLY. The only weapons you should be making for conventional soldiers are plasma snipers. This saves you SO MUCH ELERIUM. Which you will need.

**Eighth**: Research path: Rush all plasma weapons. Rush Titan Armor. Rush Firestorms. Rush Archangel Armor. Win game.

**Ninth**: Once you have ammo conservation, plasma weapons, titan and archangel armor and a firestorm on every continent you're set to win the game. What this means in actual terms is: Do not do the Alien Base Assault until you're prepared to win the game - BUT if you're not happy with a specific council or landed UFO mission, skip it and use the Alien Base Assault to restore order to a panicing country with a satellite before the end of the month. I had a bad mission which forced a lot of my main squad out of action. I skipped two landed UFO missions the next month and then used the Alien Base Assault to restore order to the world so nobody left.

**Tenth**: Take the Arc Thrower on the Alien Base Assault. The Sectoid Commander is at the back of the base and if you kill the usual pack of Chrisalids and Mutons he'll be the only creature left. Flank up to him using the highest level with your Arc Thrower character, then spot him, shoot him and zap him. This is probably the single safest and easiest Commander to capture and if you're prepared you can skip IMMEDIATELY to the Ethereal Ship and never have to fight another Sectoid Commander in the game. It also gets you Plasma Pistol research if you're so inclined.

**Eleventh**: You don't need a Firestorm in EVERY continent, but it damn well helps. You only need a Firestorm in the continent with the cloaked Ethereal ship. This ship can only be killed by Firestorms because it's just too fast. Nothing else can reliably even catch up to it, let alone take it down. On the other hand, Firestorms are nice as they can 1v1 any enemy ship with a dodge matrix so if you've got the spare flight computers just build three at once and then spread them around. Early plasma research also unlocks the powerful plasma cannon for air units, so air superiority is usually fine even with interceptors.

**Twelfth**: END THE GAME AS SOON AS YOU CAN. With rushed plasma, rushed Titans, rushed Firestorms then rushed Archangels you're set to beat the game. As soon as you reach this point, aim to win. After month 5 missions are HORRIBLE. Landed UFOs are HUGE and full of Sectopods. The fewer missions you do at this point the better. In my game I actually messed around, stalled out to complete all the research and turtled a bit to positively over-prepare (Did a ton of foundry research I didn't need, for example). I could have reasonably finished a month earlier than I did. I nearly lost the game because of it - One of the screenshots in the IMGUR album is of a Supply Barge after the 6th month. These corpses are all from one, long, endless skirmish and that's only as many as I could fit on the screen. There's no cover because I blew everything with flanking-panic tactics. Missions are NOT easy. End the game as soon as you have the capacity to.

**Thirteenth**: The final mission is EASY. Why? Scripted. You know where every enemy is, every spawn, you can easily flank and destroy everything the turn you activate it. The twin sectopod room can be destroyed before they even have a chance to act with one sight beacon and two squadsight archangels double tap snipers plus anyone else as cleanup if you don't get a good crit or two. The final Ethereal room is beaten by moving soldiers to just before the cutscene triggers, using a sight beacon to activate the cutscene and then shredding, rocketing and double tapping the etheral with backup from run and gun assaults or supports as required to deal any last dregs of damage (The 20+ shredded headshot crit from my sniper sealed the deal though.)

**Summary**:  

* Do not rush the first satellite. Wait until your first panic mission, get engineers then just buy 4 of them with the reduced cost.  
* Abuse enemy panic to force 100% safe engagements where the enemy will NEVER return fire.  
* TRAIN UP YOUR SNIPER. Day 92 Colonel is OP. Day 92 Colonel Squad Sight Double Tap Sniper? GG.  
* Rush plasma weaponry. Capture an early outsider, then muton and you've got insta easy mode plasma.  
* Rush titan armor after. This will usually be complete around the time your plasma stops 1-shotting things with crits.  
* Rush firestorms. They're flat out needed to shoot the cloaked Ethereal UFO down, they're slow to build and their research is on the way to Archangels.  
* Rush Archangels. Firestorm research should pretty much have already unlocked this, so it's a quickie.  
* Win the game.",,False,self,t5_2si6x,1370740926.0,,,True,t3_1fygwp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/1fygwp/just_completed_ironman_impossible_heres_a_few/,

I was curious to find out if you would all be interested in an AM(A)A (Ask Me Almost Anything) with the developers and maybe even some of the marketing folks behind the awesome live action trailers that we've been putting out.

I was given a choice of intercepting abductions in France, China and Australia. Before doing a mission in China, the current panic levels in Asia were:

China: 4
Japan: 2
India: 3
Australia: 2

After dong the China mission, the panic levels were:

China:1 
Japan: 2
India: 3
Australia: 4

You still take a +2 panic hit for skipping one of the countries on the continent, but you do not get +1 panic on the continent so long as you do one abduction mission there. Choosing the France mission instead would have given these results:

China: 5
Japan: 3
India: 4
Australia: 5

So there is a big advantage to picking the continent with two abduction missions on it if you have a choice since it will keep panic in check much more effectively.",,False,self,t5_2si6x,1352023442.0,,RankRookie,True,t3_12luc4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/12luc4/psa_choosing_the_continent_with_two_abductions/,

XCOM I really started wanting this game, and I love it. I really like 2K and Firaxis too.

I love how dynamic this game feels and intense it gets and i'm only playing on normal (I've only reloaded one save and try to avoid it). I've made some dumb mistakes, like selling too much alloy or corpses to build some stuff, and trying to capture a cyberdisk alive. Stupid scientist lady complaining that the troops like to use them as target practice during the autopsy made me think I could stun one for her. Besides that I feel like things are going pretty well and will probably try a C/IM game next.

To anyone thinking of getting this game while it's on sale do it, but as with all steam sales wait to see if it goes lower for a daily deal (it probably will). You can spend hours enjoying this game (and I haven't even tried multiplayer) and because it's turn based you can save in the middle of a mission and step away anytime you need to.

XCOM is punishing. It is unforgiving. It does not care if you win, especially on the harder difficulties.

I personally enjoy games that aren't meant to be beaten on a hard difficulty the first play through. XCOM WILL teach you how to play it if you play it long enough. I am of the opinion that games have become too easy. I am NOT saying that I am some sort of master at gaming. I haven't beaten it on classic, but man do I enjoy the challenge. I hope to beat it eventually on classic, but if not, no big deal. 

What say you? How do you feel? Are these people in the 'right' to get their 'moneys worth' (whatever that may be, read: personal value)? Should they admit defeat and move to a lower difficulty?",,False,self,t5_2si6x,1350313169.0,,XCOMEUCaptain,True,t3_11iet2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/11iet2/ive_seen_a_lot_of_critique_on_the_difficulty_of/,

1350981785.0,73,self.Xcom,11xr8w,"Vigilo, Confido: The meaning of XCOM's motto.",89,16,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/11xr8w/vigilo_confido_the_meaning_of_xcoms_motto/,"XCOM has a pretty good marketing director, it seems, because it has rebranded itself with a badass-sounding Latin motto to match its badass name, crest, and image - that of a clandestine paramilitary organization that kicks alien invader butt. For the most part. When its rookies don't panic and shoot their Lieutenant in the back. But at any rate- what does *Vigilo, Confido* mean? 

[*Vigilo*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vigilo#Latin) is the first person present active indicative of the Latin verb *vigilare*, which means *to watch, remain awake, keep vigil*, so it could be translated, a little more figuratively, as *I am watchful* or *I am vigilant*. 

[*Confido*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/confido#Latin) is the first person present active indicative of the verb *confidere*, which means *to be confident or assured of, confide in, believe, trust, place or put confidence in; rely upon*. It can be translated in two ways, effectively: The first interpretation is *I rely upon* or *I trust in*. What does *I trust* refer to? Well, it could refer to the first component of the motto, so in effect it would mean

*I trust that I am vigilant* 

or, more loosely (and somewhat poetically) 

*I trust in [my] vigilance* 

or 

*I rely upon [my] vigilance*. 

The second interpretation of the *confido* component just means *I am confident*, without the need for an object to place trust in; it's just a quality of the speaker, therefore literally 

*I am vigilant - I am confident*. 

If we wanted to give this interpretation a poetic spin as well, we could extrapolate the ""confident, assured"" meaning of the word to come up with 

*I am vigilant - I am steadfast*. 

Latin is a complicated language. Latin phrases can be translated and understood differently according to context, so since we don't have any more textual context, you can in effect pick and choose whichever translation you think is most appropriate to XCOM. You can go ahead and make it as epic-sounding as you like, so for example instead of *I trust in vigilance* you could say something like *I place my trust in watchfulness*, or anything that suits your fancy.

**TL;DR** The XCOM motto can mean: 

1. *I trust in vigilance*

2. *I am vigilant - I am steadfast* 

*Disclaimer* It's been a while since my Latin courses so any corrections/additions/whatnot more than welcome!

As a very modular game there are loads of things that could be added, be it quality of life changes or features to add complexity.

The reason I want to make this, is because I am not too thrilled about the first announced DLC, and complaining never changed anything. Also since the core features are slowly being unlocked this could also be a source of inspiration for modders.

I will start by adding a few ideas from other threads, as well as the [Nexusmod Forums](http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/forum/561-xcom-mod-requests/).

I would be very happy if people would post more suggestions here. If you see something, and you think it was your idea, tell me and I will give you credit [like this].

**== Features ==**

 - **^1) Mappack** A very common request, more variety in maps for the differen mission types. More maps that are specific to different regions of the world (different countries, urban environment, jungle...) [wild9]

 - **^2) (Even) More Soldier Customization**  Another favorite. More helmets, hairstyles or maybe armor tags for your troops. Accents for different countries. [DeedTheInky]

 - **^3) Terror from the Deep** For those who didn't play it, the [first XCOMs sequel](http://www.ufopaedia.org/index.php?title=TFTD) had underwater missions. This would most just add another layer to the simulation part. The underwater missions had fans divided, but I think if done right, they could bring a special atmosphere into the game. Definitely too big for a mod, but might be possible as downloadable content. Worst case scenario: Sequel.

 - **^4) Base defense** One of the coolest parts of the original was, that your base could be attacked itself if you really caught the aliens attention. Obviously this is a bit more complex, since you have less freedom in designing your own base, the antfarm design and the fact that you only have one. ~~But it would be possible to add additional bases of operation, giving you more control across the globe in addition to just putting up satellites.~~ Interceptor bases could be fleshed out with a few customization options. This would provide nice stakes in the mission itself. [Topdawg540] It could also refine the panic management options the game gives you, especially mid to lategame. (France is in panic? We gotcha' we just put a military base into your country, so we get another chance to react to terror and abductions.)

 - **^5) Rival organizations** 'So France just gave you the boot? What are they doing now? Just giving up? Oh there is another organization that gets their funding. Oh so they want to use the alien technology to seize power after the invasion is dealt with? Oh and now they are sabotaging XCOM equipment to get even more members of the council on their side? Strike-1 -  show them that a plasma rifle is just as effective against terrorists.' This is vaguely inspired by Apocalypse's Organizations. I think the other organizations role should not be to complex, but their goal could be randomized. Some organizations are idealists, others are greedy and some just straight out power hungry, like in my story.

 - **^6) Better UFO interceptions** Tbh, the interception part feels a bit like a missed opportunity if not a placeholder. Another tactic layer could be amazing. For the same cost of the old fighters you can now build squadrons. Well equipped interceptors can fail if directed poorly, the lone fighter pilot might succeed. Also opens the door for more Fighter strategy, by having to intercept a bombing run on a city or entering an airborne UFO, by blowing a hole in it's hull.

 - **^7) Cyber enhanced Soldiers** Very cool mod/dlc idea by [AreYouReadyToReddit]. Recover your mortally injured, high ranking, long serving soldiers from a failed mission and give them the 'the six million dollar man' treatment. [Details in the original thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/120bqm/mod_idea_we_can_rebuild_him_we_have_the_technology/)

 - **^8) Second Wave** These mods are basically in the game and are already partially unlocked. This is also just a general placeholder for any sorts of modifications, that can be turned on and off that will keep randomizing the gameplay and therefore adding more replay value. If anyone has a specific idea for additional Second Wave mods, that are not included in the original SW, I will add them here.

 - **^9) Melee Weapons** Knives, Bayonets, Machetes. Would be just one more little cue from the 40K direction that could go a long way. Especially since point blank attacks are already a valid tactic. Very high percentage to hit adjacent targets, bonus damage against unarmored opponents, zero damage against mechanical opponents? Could be a mixture of killing/arc-ing an enemy. (No corpse but you get the weapon) [gndn]

 - **^10) More Weapon types** Flamethrowers are always nice in the battle against aliens. [DeedTheInky] The classic XCOM also had napalm, grenade launchers, small launchers and stun bombs. [Geeky_Frignit] TFTD added Gauss and Sonic weapons. Thermal Weapons, Dart Guns, Toxic and Electric weapons have been seen in XCOMs of the past. Some of those are probably best kept for a potential sequel, but a few more weapon options, especially situational weapon options should be possible in the current tactical system. [ActionFlank] More upgrade options, that you have to choose from (read cannot afford all). Stun grenade and rockets to get a little breathing room. [PressureCereal]

 - **^11) Squads** The option to save premade squads or squad setups. It would give them a little flavour, assigning symbols and names. You could save them for specific missions (Jetpack for the sniper in the terror mission squad, 2 assaults for UFO crashsites, anti robo ammo, if the scanners pick up sectopods). [peon47]

-------------

**== Patch/Small changes ==**

 - **^1) Official Modding Support** Bethesda/CD Project style. Firaxis/2K/T2 get clearance from legal. It helps the game. No really. There is still plenty of stuff that mods can never add. [at8mistakes]

 - **^2) Mind Controlling the only alien left ends the mission and the alien is taken as a live captive.** To balance, if a mind-controlled alien is killed, the psi operative controlling it has an (increased) chance of panicking. While we're on that, having your whole squad have a chance of panicking if your MC'ed alien dies is stupid, and should be removed. [PressureCereal]

 - **^3) Close doors!** If you are able to open them, you should also close them to limit alien vision. Again, more tactical options is a win in my book. [PressureCereal]

 - **^4) Fixed Camera Level** I know this isn't a gameplay effect, but for the love of FSM, I'd love to be able to fix the camera level or have an option to completely remove ceilings. Those missions on the large alien battleships are a nightmare because I have to scroll down after I select every soldier, because the camera chooses to reset and completely hide the entire squad under the ceiling - so extremely annoying. [PressureCereal]

 - **^5) Instant Battle/Skirmish mode** Once you've finished the campaign the game allows you to select Instant Battle. This will load a random map, random aliens and allow you to fight with your existing soldiers and equipment. Deaths are not permanent. Difficulty level is adjustable. Should have game modes such as Instagib, Rocket Launchers only, pistols only, etc. [D0natell0]

 - **^6) Replay function** Possibility to re watch and record your battle after it's over. [D0natell0]

 - **^7) Better information on mission overview.**  I want to see terror level on all countries in affected continent when picking alien abduction mission. [fraggelsmurf] I personally would love to see my injured soldiers without having to 'Esc' out.

-------------

**== Mod only (things that are not in the game by design choice) ==**

 - **^1) Inventory system** The designers removed the more complex logistic elements in favor of just forcing the player to make more choices. In some of those cases I think a middle ground would have been more efficient.

 - **^2) More soldier stats** Like 1 I think a middle ground between RPG style stats and basically just 2-3 stats that are not really soldier specific are bit bland. I personally would even be satisfied if there was more variation in HP, Amor, Movement and Willpower among the soldiers. More variation, forces a broader variety of different tactics. Right now, e.g. if all my soldiers wear the same armor, they usually have very similar HP and movement, which kinda monotonizes a few things. And in consequence giving me the choice to choose my soldiers class after he gets promoted at hand of his stats.

 - **^3) Take more than 6 soldiers per mission.** That has been a staple of all previous XCOM games. Even in the original game, you could work through it by swarming your enemies and sustaining heavy casualties but at the end of the day, you beat the missions. [Here is a good discussion and some early results on nexusmods.](http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/804076-rd-to-increase-squad-size/).[PressureCereal]

 - **^4) Destroy environment by emptying the entire clip of a weapon in a single free aim attack.** There has been a lot of talk about having free aim, with the usual counter-argument being that it would unbalance the game, because it's so dependent on cover for defense. If there was some way to balance that out, I don't see why free aim couldn't be a thing - I already use nades and rockets to remove cover. I thought emptying the entire clip and therefore making your soldier waste 2 turns - one to destroy the environment and one to reload - would be a sufficient time investment that maybe it would be balanced out.

 - **^5) Additional Elerium source** in some way. Potientially as a nother facility 

 - **^6) Creating your soldier from scratch.** Possibility to change gender, nationality and class of recruits. [calb1988]

A couple of people alluded to it and someone even made a mod to do it, but it's really simple with a text editor.

Anyway go to: 

..\steamapps\common\XCom-Enemy-Unknown\XComGame\Config

Find the file DefaultEngine.ini and open it with a text editor (notepad works).

Find the section that says:

    ; PC Startup movies
    +StartupMovies=Logo_2KFiraxis
    +StartupMovies=UE3TechLogo
    +StartupMovies=LogoLegal_PCConsole
    +StartupMovies=1280x720_Black

In front of each of those + signs, add a semi colon ; so it ends up looking like this:

    ; PC Startup movies
    ;+StartupMovies=Logo_2KFiraxis
    ;+StartupMovies=UE3TechLogo
    ;+StartupMovies=LogoLegal_PCConsole
    ;+StartupMovies=1280x720_Black

Save the file and exit. Next time you launch the game it goes straight to the main menu.

Good luck, Commander.

1352134289.0,69,self.Xcom,12o9wo,Finished Ironman Impossible. I have one important tip on decision making,77,8,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/12o9wo/finished_ironman_impossible_i_have_one_important/,"r/xcom is pretty great and if you search you can find great tips on just about anything. I want to touch on the subject of how to approach decision making in xcom. This is not a rule but rather something that I have found to be very effective way of thinking:

**Work to minimize potential damage you will take at the end of each turn**

This essentially means two things:

1. Prioritize avoiding damage over dealing damage.
2. When comparing option A with B, calculate probabilities of you taking damage and choose whichever keeps you safest.

Here is an example scenario:

You have two supports with one move remaining and one enemy in sight. One of your supports is in half cover, the other is in full cover. Half cover support can run out of LoS. The enemy will die in one hit, and you have a 45% shot from both supports.

**Option A**

Take a shot with both supports.

You have 30.25% to miss both shots. If you do, you will take fire from an enemy in half cover.

**Option B**

Fire with full cover support, run away with half cover support.
You have 55% chance to miss, in which case you will take fire on your full cover support.

**Option C**

Run away with half cover support, hunker down with full cover support.
You have 100% chance to take fire on hunkered down full cover support.


Which is better? Well it depends on who you are fighting, how much hp you have etc... Usually C is the best option, especially if your support can survive a non-critical hit. If you usually choose Option A you are probably having a hard time in Classic/Impossible.

While enjoyable, I found myself itching for a challenge for the rest of the game once i'd upgraded to the heaviest armor available.

After completion i headed back in and found that while I'd learned a lot, there are still quite a few tactics that are crucial for Classic that i rarely/never used on classic. I have a few, i'm sure if others chime in we could compile quite the list.

**Use Suppression fire early and often:** On my normal playthrough i found suppression a waste of a turn as most often my heavy could just shoot whatever he was targeting. I learned in classic that the best function of supression isn't the aim penalty (which becomes very nice in classic) but the fact that once you gain energy based weapons *suppression destroys cover*. First action is have the heavy or support suppress away cover, the rest are taking reasonable percentage shots. In conjunction with this...

**Holo Targeting is actually amazing** As with suppression, holo-targeting was pretty worthless when all enemies went down in a well aimed burst. In classic weapons do less than max damage with regularity, rather than occasionally, thus holo-targeting becomes worthwhile when even a base muton might take 3 shots from a light plasma rifle if you're unlucky.

**Support are king** Support go from meh to critical when your troops actually start taking damage. Classic made me long for the days when i'd end late game terror missions with spare medkits. Currently i'm often making triage decisions by halfway through most combat larger than a small scout UFO. Don't neglect to have spares.

**All cover is not created equal** Low cover is acceptable when there is nothing else, but high cover is always preferable, even if it will take longer to reach. I pretty much ignored the differences between the two (to the point I didn't even know exactly what the difference *was*), but by the second mission of classic I learned that the difference is often the difference between a dead soldier and a live one.

My Pride and Joy
http://i.imgur.com/LMMn3.jpg


Hey guys, I just spend about 14 hours playing XCOM, I ran it with many of the Second Wave addons. Here are my though on my extended play through. 

Damage Roulette: Weapons have a wider range of damage. *(Disabled)
I actually started a game with this one on. It was kinda cool when the aliens shot me and only did 1 point of damage. It was NOT COOL when they did 5 damage (1 shotting a rookie behind full cover) and I did only 1. So after a few missions I did a quick restart without this option enabled. It might seem cool but when you are playing Ironman, less RNG is better.

New Economy: Randomized council member funding. (Enabled)
This one does not add a lot. Some country's may give 10-50 bucks more or less. On my play through I never saw anything go past 150 dollars (USA without this enabled). Overall its pretty cool and should be enabled even if you are playing on Ironman.

Not Created Equally: Rookies will have random starting stats.(Enabled)
I have to say it ""I LOVE THIS ONE"". Its probably the most awesome thing you can add to any play through. This gives you're soldiers a unique feel. I had rookies starting with up to 80 Aim. I also had rookies start with less then 55. Same goes with Will, some rookies started with just over 30 Will and some had up to 60.

Hidden Potential: As a soldier is promoted, stats increase randomly.(Enabled)
I have to say it again ""I LOVE THIS ONE"". Hidden Potential is really amazing especially paired with Not Created Equally. I had soldiers gain as much as 7 points per level. I also them gain none, zero, zilch. 
I found the meanest rookie I had, 80 Aim, 35 Will. First time she got promoted she went up to 87 Aim and got a Sniper Rifle. Needless to say she was on the last mission. With a whopping 124 Aim base. That's right 124, that is 19 more Aim then a standard colonel sniper who has 105 at the end of the game. But this also swings the other way, I had a rookie with 80 Aim, given a LMG. When she hit Colonel her aim was still only 84. But her Will was in the high 70s. Even at the end of the game when I had multiple Colonel just in case something went wrong I had to ask the questions, do I value higher Will over higher Aim. Or even when I receive a new recruit from a mission. Do I think they will have better stats late game or not?

Red Fog: Combat wounds will degrade the soldier's mission stats. (Disabled)
I really wanted to run this one. But in the end chose not to. I am not sure how harshly this impacts a soldiers Aim (as getting shot already lowers Will). But its something I might revisit in a later play through.

Absolutely Critical: A flanking shot guarantees a critical hit. (Enabled)
I really liked this one. How ever, Absolutely Critical makes Assault GOD MODE. With Run and Gun almost every hit is a Critical Hit. Once you hit Colonel you can never be Crit Either. Making the class way to strong. Over all I enjoyed this addon a lot. If i had to replay on Impossible, I would enable it. Although Absolutely Critical does make the game a bit easier because most of the time a crit will kill something and its 100%. It reduces RNG, and in this way makes the game less about luck.

The Greater Good: Psionics can only be learned from interrogating a psionic alien.
A fine addition. Just snag the first guy from the base mission. Pretty cool, if you kill him on accident does increase the play time as you have to shoot down UFOs to capture one like the Energy Guys.

Marathon: The game takes considerably longer to complete. (Enabled)
This makes the game really easy. I had a Colonel on the second terror mission. With a few Majors following in his foot steps. Over all, this setting does increase the play time. It took me 72 days to get beam weapons. Before the Mutons came, I had nearly a full team of Colonels. On normal speed, you might have a Major if you're lucky.

Results Driven: A country offers less funding as its panic level increases.(Disabled)
This is the last one I had disabled. I was not sure how this would impact the game with Diminishing Returns, High Stakes and Marathon Enabled. I am glad I did not have it enabled because satellites where costing me up to 2800 at the end of the game, and that was just for the 7th one. The first one cost almost 500. Though I made more of my money though selling space ship parts. I had like 400 Elariumand 500 Alien Alloys sitting in base. And that was after sellling 200 of both. Simple put you shoot down a lot of space ships on Marathon. 

High Stakes: Random rewards for stopping alien abductions.
Pretty cool feature, some times I would get like 120 dollars or like 2 scientists. Really makes you think, are 2 Engineers better then 5 scientists. Overall It did not change what I though it would change. I though it would allow duplicates, like 1 country offering 2 engineers, while the other one is offering 5. Instead they just change how much you get.

Diminishing Returns: Increased cost of satellite construction.
Man this one is a bitch. I almost failed the game because I did not have any satellites. The first one cost me 500. The next one cost me 900. At the end of the game I had only 6 satellites with the next one needing almost 2800 and 68 engineers. Overall good if you want to try and rush the game. 

More Than Human: The psionic gift is extremely rare.
I got my psionic on my second batch. So it seems like the chance is reduced by 50% from first look. Also note, that with Not Created Equally and Hidden Potential you base chances can be higher or lower because of higher or lower Will.

I have not beaten the game yet on Impossible, so I do not have the last 4 unlocked. But they are pretty ridiculous and should only be used when seeking the highest challenge.

A soldier who takes damage less than or equal to his armor bonus isn't considered injured at the end of the mission.

2. If you overwatch with a squadsight sniper, then reveal an enemy group, the sniper can shoot through walls to hit any target during their ""free move."" EDIT: This seems to a bug exclusive to the PS3 version.

3. Battle scanners don't reveal an area, instead, they act as an additional line of sight, meaning they can't see through walls, floors, or around corners.

4. The soldiers you start the game with have 2 less hp than soldiers you recruit after the game starts via the barracks menu.

5. Aliens stunned by arc throwers stay stunned forever. Edit: Stunned enemies WILL die if an explosion occurs nearby them.

6. Enemies that know where your squad is, but don't have vision of you (either by noise or by being revealed prior) move in a very buggy manner, sometimes they can even teleport into the middle of your squad.

7. The star by a soldier's name means they are squad leader. If they die, the entire squad takes a large hit to morale. The squad leader is the highest ranking/most experienced member of the group.

8. When you research a SHIV in the foundry, you still have to build it under the Vehicles/Satillites tab of the Engineering menu.

9. Scientists aren't acutally needed, they just increase research speed.

10. On the other hand, a minimum number of engineers are required to build things.

11. The defense stat affects aim. Every 1 defense is a -1% penalty to anything trying to hit that unit.

12. Low cover is 20 defense, high cover is 40.

13. Capturing aliens allows you to recover their weapons, and also interrogating them will give you research credits, which reduce the time to research things by 50%.

14. The bonus for having a base in NA only applies to aircraft, not satillites.

15. Sectopods are assholes.

EDIT: 16. The PC version allows you to select units that have already moved by clicking them. They can then perform ""free"" actions, such as opening doors, deactivating bombs, or switching weapons, (this allows you to move a sniper, switch to pistol, overwatch, then switch back.) The PS3 and Xbox360 versions cannot do this.

#17. Gravely wounded soldiers lose Will permanently.

#18. If you put a facility so it borders two other facilities of the same type (like an L formation) then you recieve two adajaceny bonuses.

If I think of anything else, I'll edit this.

To clarify here, I'm on PS3 version, so a lot of stuff that applies to PC version I have no clue about.",,False,self,t5_2si6x,1350353169.0,,Ethereal,True,t3_11h7ze,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/11h7ze/so_heres_a_bunch_of_faq_and_some_extra_info_for/,

And Firaxis post-release game support has been woefully inadequate, which is just infuriating me more. Two half assed patches that really didn't address the worst offending game bugs, and a DLC that pretty much goes against the spirit of the rest of the game, oh, and yes, adds some more game breaking bugs in the process.

Now, to business! What's your squad, and more importantly, *why*? As a little icebreaker, here's what I went with first game...

**Old Squad**

2 Snipers, 2 Heavies, Assault and Support.

That basically just happened because they were the first squaddies I ever got, a sniper, two heavies and an assault, and I grabbed two soldiers, a sniper and a support from mission rewards (I didn't know back then, forgive me!) and that worked pretty well. 

Now, planning it out, I think that this isn't quite the ideal setup, at least not for my play style. My double-tap sniper wasn't nearly as practical and guaranteed-smashing as an assault, and a medic-support was the weakest part of the team. I really enjoyed having two heavies on board, simply for the amount of improvisation they give with heat ammo, suppression and bulletstorm on each, so they're staying, which means ditching a sniper, and relying heavily on the ITZ sniper. 

~

    New Squad

1 Sniper, 2 Heavies, 2 Assault, 1 Support

**Sniper:**

* Squadsight (Best ability they have), 

* Damn Good Ground (Compliments Squadsight perfectly)

* Disabling Shot (Which I prefer to Battle Scanner because it counters Mind Control, and the BS is BS when he's the guy at the back of the pack from Squadsight)

* Opportunist (So many great kills on guys sneaking up on the squad)

* In The Zone (Beautiful ability for crowd control, and Double Tap is significantly inferior to a Bulletstorm/Heat Ammo or Alloy Cannon/Rapid fire at taking down the big bastards.)

My only sniper. Due to the lack of their mobility, I find that two snipers just muddles up the whole team, and trying to get them to find two good vantage points before I get Archangel Armour means they just bicker and squabble over who gets the best spot. 

**Heavy**

* Bullet Swarm (Just dominates the alternative)

* Suppression (Superior to the Shredder Rocket so much. You can control the alien movements with 2-3 suppressors easily.)

* Heat Ammo (Because machines are the only *big* enemies that scare me, and I need to take them down FAST)

* Danger Zone (I save my rockets until emergency situations. When those situations arise, I need everything to die in sight)

* Mayhem (Goes really well with Danger Zone!)

All in all, I won't go into too much detail here, because at no stage do I think that any of the other abilities even make me look twice, and it's a fairly nicely rounded build, all things complimenting eachother, making suppression the best move in the game (especially with Ammo Conservation from the foundry). There's a reason I have 2 of these guys, and it's cause they kick ass!

**Assault**

Now here's where I'd like some assistance and input. Honestly, I have no idea what abilities to give my assault characters, far from clean cut like the other ones. Is it better to have a breacher and a killer, a long range and a short? [Here's the wiki so you can look](http://xcom.wikia.com/wiki/Assault_Class), would love the feedback!

**Support**

* Covering Fire (Extra movement really isn't needed on my support... if it was assault, then maybe, but I feel that this ability has the added benefit of actually making enemies do *nothing* often when it's activated, so great for controlling their brains!)

* Smoke and Mirrors (Prefer to keep my guys alive than mop up the pieces... there are always 2-3 times a smoke grenade would really help, even if it's a double edged sword, it can help a guy at least get out alive.)

* Revive (Two heavies frees up another suppression slot, and 33% health is enough to shoot up some sons of bitches)

* Dense Smoke (Because smoke bombs become SWEET with this.)

* Sentinel (Makes him an overwatch machine with this in addition to Covering Fire)

55 aim rookie?  Guess who's taking point!

114 aim sniper at only lieutenant level?  That guy is going places.

I never quite felt attached to my guys like I did in the original X-Com; after all, I could always just level up another identical guy.  But this... it breaks my barracks into VIPs, potential VIPs (if they level well), and, well, fodder.  And I love it!

Discussion of the options:

- Damage roulette.  Seems to unequivocally make the game harder.  Hitting for 1 sucks a lot.  I'm curious how I will feel about it once I am beyond the basic weapons and/or fighting guys where randomly rolling high could be a win.

- New economy.  Interesting, and a great 'replayability' option for people who are getting tired of the same strategic map build orders.  I wish you could tell what your starting funding was going to be in continent select though.

- Not created equally: Definitely makes the game easier (random +15 aim guys), but also I think makes it more fun.  Gives fodder guys (random -10 aim or -20 will), and gives you an incentive to recruit more rookies early.

- Hidden potential: makes the game slightly easier, in my opinion, but also can do some interesting things.  I have a heavy who started at 80 aim (godly!) but only gained 1 aim at squaddie, and hasn't gained any aim after levelling after that.  Meanwhile my 'pretty good' sniper has graduated to ridiculousness status with an extra hp and more aim than colonels in regular games.  It's kind of interesting having a reliable shot but *without* the double tap/ITZ perk that makes it completely broken.

Without having played with them at all, I'd say most of the other options only make the game harder, with the exception of Absolutely Critical (which could go either way, but I think I tend to take more flanking shots than the aliens), and Red Fog if it applies to aliens (which I doubt it does).

I'm still getting teleporting aliens; my classic game had the graveyard map and two different groups of inactive sectoids teleported and had a full turn after activating.

Also, I am seeing some groups of patrolling aliens teleport far away and  *then* activate, way out of my view range.  It's like I randomly got vision of them before they teleport, which triggers their activation.

But overall, lots of fun replayability and I'm looking forward to hopefully completing I/I with the 'easy mode' recruit/levelling options.",,False,self,t5_2si6x,False,,,True,t3_168otn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/168otn/i_love_second_wave/,

Hi guys. My name is Greg Laabs, and I'm the Senior Community Manager at 2K Games.

XCOM: Enemy Unknown will be *playable* at PAX in Seattle this weekend. If Gamescom was any indication, the line to play the game is likely to get quite long. And that's why I'm here.

I'm going to give one lucky /r/xcom subscriber a ""2K Community VIP"" pass that will allow you to skip the line to play XCOM: EU (bonus: it also does the same for Borderlands 2 and the XCOM panel on Saturday).

All you need to do is leave a comment here confirming that you will be at PAX and telling me why you should be the one to get the pass. People should feel free to upvote your favorite reasons and I'll take that in to consideration (I'll ignore downvotes).

But wait there's more! I'm sure all of you agree that there are FAR more than 506 fans of all things XCOM here on reddit. To encourage you to spread the word, I'll give away *another* VIP pass for each additional 100 subscribers we get on /r/xcom

In the squad view screen before you go into battle, you can arrange the squad in move order. The six slots (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 from left to right) correspond to the order in which you can issue commands to each team member (5th, 2nd, 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th). 

For example, in my squad of 2 assaults, 1 heavy, 2 support, 1 sniper, I usually like to move my assaults first, the heavy/support next, and sniper last. To circle through the team in this order,  I would order my squad:

    .Slot1....Slot2....Slot3...Slot4...Slot5...Slot6..    

    ..5th......2nd......1st.....3rd.....4th.....6th..

    support..assault..assault..heavy..support..sniper

Since I figured this out it has made battles flow so much smoother. Can't believe I finished 1.5 playthroughs without knowing this. Don't know if it works the same on PS3 or even useful with the PC UI, but hope it helps.

Panic level is before they expect the government to fail.  They withdraw because the country falls into chaos, Somolia style, and there is no banking system, or enough leadership to be able to fund the project any more.

It's not that they don't want to fund you, they physically can't any more.

Well, after that I was pretty disheartened. I trudged on, and managed to get another fairly decent squad put together. Squad #2 was not as high in rank/experience as my first elite, but showing promise. 

Then....a very large UFO came. I was nervous, but knew my new squad had strength and went for it. The first half was cake - right out of the gate, 3 chryssalids charged in - killed them all in 1 turn, luckily. No worries. Saw some mutons including 2 Beserkers - dead. Awesome.

Then, I get to the cockpit. Before I enter, I hear noise outside of the ship and I think ""ah, I should kill that alien quick before I take the cockpit and end the mission."" And so I left 2 people to cover the cockpit door, and sent 4 outside to the left to start the quick search/kill. 

10 TURNS LATER (not fucking joking) 

I'm still outside. I had found some Mutons - killed 3 but I saw 5 - could NOT FIND the other 2 for the longest time. Finally deciding I was imagining things, I went to withdraw my 4 troopers and OHMYFUCKINGGODTHEYWEREHIDINGINOVERWATCH. Yep. In the corner next to the ramp to the ship - in the farthest corner. Both of them. Mutons. On overwatch. Dug in. Not leaving. 

They. Wouldn't. Leave. Cover. 

I threw grenades. Damage, but no kills. Out of rockets. No grenades left. They just sat there, on overwatch...taunting me. I knew I couldn't ignore them, but I couldn't get close enough to kill them. It was basically a fucking draw - but Xcom doesn't allow draws so I had to do something. 

Long story short  - everything I tried failed and I ended up doing some crazy shit that worked out as you'd expect - all 4 squad members dead. In the end I **finally** got the last 2 mutons using my 2 soliders who were guarding the cockpit. 

So then I go back to the cockpit (3 turns later) and BOOM! 2 energy guys. They pull a random low-percentage shot and kill 1 of my squad right off. Great. Now I have 1 vs 2 - and it's not looking good. I play an actual game of cat and mouse - running all over the ship, looking for cover - taking some shots, retreating, going outside and trying to flank - it was epic. We're talking a good 8 turns of this shit. 

In the end - I killed 1 of the energy guys but the other one - sigh - was hiding in a corner on overwatch and killed me. MY ENTIRE SQUAD WIPED OUT...AGAIN. I was at the fucking cockpit with all 6 soldiers and then suddenly - they're all dead. Fuck you, XCOM. Sers'ly. 

So...there I was. A failed mission. 6 squad dead. I have 4 FUCKING ROOKIES left in my barracks - that's it. I was about to quit but then thought - fuck it. I'll keep going. Why not. So I trudged on, in true ""e_vision likes videogame pain"" fashion. 

I purchased 10 new soldiers and then did the smartest thing I've done yet - I purchased the Officer Training School perk that makes all rookies into squaddies. That means they each are assigned a class the moment they show up. Because of this, I was able to pick a squad that suited me - 2 heavies (need those fucking rockets), sniper, assault, and 2 support. 

I gave all of them yellow armor - because --- I don't know. They are the last hope. Why not yellow. Anyway, I outfitted them and decided to see how rookies would fare against Mutons. 

Fast forward all weekend - as of now, I have some captains and sergeants and everybody is holding their own. I am in the middle of an extra-large UFO right now and things are going well, for the most part. I have titan armor and the squad is (for the 3rd time this playthrough) strong and reliable. 

ROOKIE SQUAD YELLOW FOR THE FUCKING GOLD!!!!! 

edit: **TLDR; My entire squad was wiped out for the 2nd time this playthru on Ironman Classic - 3rd squad all rookies and are currently holding their own and are in the middle of a very large UFO takedown**

1357241089.0,50,self.Xcom,15wigx,"A pretty helpful tip for picking abduction missions, and succeeding in Classic Ironman.",69,19,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/15wigx/a_pretty_helpful_tip_for_picking_abduction/,"So I'm on my 10th or so go at Classic Ironman . I can always progress somewhat far enough to get a few colonels, plasma weapons, decent satellite coverage, etc, but I always end up resetting after panic levels get out of control, or some freak RNG mishap results in my entire squad of high level soldiers getting eliminated (once I had a squaddie sniper get poisoned, panic, shoot and finally hit something, but it was a crit shot on  my colonel sniper, who died, and from there, the whole mission went out of control).

Anywayyy, I've finally figured out what, at least for me, was a breakthrough. I've always read that you should prioritize abduction missions in some form of this mantra: Panic level 4+ &gt; Engineers &gt; Money &gt; Soldiers &gt; Scientists

While the above is pretty straight forward, the underlying message is that controlling panic levels is the most important thing. Once a country withdraws, you lose them, and if 8 withdraw, you lose the game. But is it always wise to pick the country with panic level 4+ if the other two are 1-2? No! Because when you finish the mission, the country in which you did it loses panic level, but the entire continents of the countries you ignored will gain panic.

So go back to your world map and look at the continents. If, for example, the three abduction sites are Canada (Panic 4), Germany (Panic 1), and let's say Japan (Panic 3), you would normally pick Canada, right? But if USA and Mexico are relatively calm, and Asia is all 2-3 panic level, but Europe is all panic level 3-4 (except Germany), then you will be in a MUCH more uncomfortable position if you pick any of the abduction sites other than Germany (even though Germany itself is only panic level 1).

I don't know if this was common knowledge, but I certainly didn't know about it, and following it I have finally completed full satellite coverage without losing a single country from the counsel.

Some other helpful tips for Classic Ironman (or any difficulty/mode):

1. Start in Africa

2. At the very start of each month, and no later than the 9th of each month, build in the following order: Month 1 - Satellite; Month 2 - Satellite Uplink, 3 x Satellites; Month 3 - Satellite Uplink - 3 x Satellites; Month 4 - Satellite Nexus - 5 x Satellites (MAKE SURE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED)

3. 5 days before each month, make sure that you will have enough power/space to build your satellite uplink for the next month. There's nothing worse than than realizing you won't be able to start your satellite uplink in time for it to be ready by the end of the month to support your incoming satellites.

4. Although it's not the best strat for building up a good amount of weapon fragments, 4+ Heavies in a squad early on make for pretty easy missions. 8+ rockets (including shredders) are often enough to take out every enemy in the mission, and you don't need to worry as much about RNG as they have good range and are a 90% shot no matter what. Also, they give you some peace of mind to scout with your first soldier or two, because even if you reveal enemies in positions that may not offer cover, one of your remaining heavies are likely able to hit them with a rocket (and early on, 6 damage is usually enough to kill).

5. With correct play, you shouldn't be getting hit at all, so go for beam weapons before carapace armor. This means your first research should be weapon fragments and then beam weapons (after the first UFO mission), instead of Alien Materials and carapace armor.

6. If you have the slingshot DLC, you can delay the missions indefinitely if you don't feel ready. The first mission can be done with 4 squaddies/corporals without beam weapons/carapace armor. I personally don't recommend the second mission until you have a squad of 6 soldiers armed with both beam weapons/carapace. And the third should be left until you really feel comfortable. It's a long mission. Heavies are particularly useful (don't want to spoil why). AGAIN, YOU CAN DELAY THEM WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE AS LONG AS YOU WANT. But the rewards for doing them are incredible (A Heavy Captain with high will *wink wink* and above normal hp, 4 engineers, 2 scientists, $200, and ~$2,000 worth of material)

7. Don't ignore ships. Make sure to have one aim, dodge, and boost available at all times for a difficult UFO encounter, and keep track of which continents have satellites and how many interceptors they have. For one satellite, you only need one interceptor. But have at least two in continents with full coverage. By Month 4+, consider having a satellite or two in storage in case one gets taken down (you can replace it instantly) and for requests.

8. I personally like to wait on researching Xeno Biology (for Alien Containment) until I have my finances etc in order. This means (for me) that I want full satellite coverage before I even begin with the storyline missions. May take longer, but I find that it's easier to compartmentalize your tasks instead of trying to tackle them all at once.

Ever move to a safe flanking position, only to find your soldier is 1 tile out of sight range?

Ever started sweating... because you *think* that you're just outside of that Chryssalid's movement range... and it starts moving towards you...

Well, I've had all those, and I decided to look it up. Unfortunately, Xcom Wikia, UFOpaedia, and /r/Xcom have all disappointed. Both Xcom Wikia and UFOpaedia just straight up datamine range entries from game files, which doesn't help because the in game range units are different to tiles. There's bits here and there, so I've decided to collect it all together here. I owe it to the dead soldier that made me look it up.


I had looked up the movement of a Chryssalid before my first encounter, which both Xcom Wikia and UFOpaedia list as 20. Chryssalids definitely can't move 40 tiles in a turn, and neither do they move 20 tiles in a half move, so I thought it meant that their movement allowance was 20 tiles. So I put one of my brave men 12 tiles away, since, if you have to  double move, you can't attack. He died. This then made me look up what all the ranges meant. To my surprise, the majority of range values in most resources are useless to the player because they haven't been converted to tiles.

1. Range in game files =/= tiles
To convert range units into tiles, use the following formula : (Range*2/3)-1, rounded down

2. Diagonals are calculated using a pythagorian triangle, rounded down.
If you forgot, for a right-angled triangle, a^2 + b^2 = c^2
Moving 5 tiles straight, and 5 tiles to the side would cost SQRT( 5^2 +5^2 ), or 7 movement.
An alien 12 tiles along 1 axis, and 14 tiles along the other axis is SQRT( 12^2 + 14^2 ), or 18 tiles away, which mean out of sight range.

3. Stuff useful to know

*Sight range - 17 tiles

*Half/Single move - 7 tiles

*Dash/Double move - 15 tiles

*Weapon penalty/bonus threshold(see below) - 10 tiles

Well, that's it. There wasn't a lot, so I was surprised there's been no in depth article on any wiki nor even the subreddit. Now maybe you can optimise your gameplay by counting tiles(though diagonals are really hard to judge sometimes).


---------------------------------------

**TL;DR** - Chryssalids can move 12 tiles in 1 move. So be at least 14 tiles away.

We (me, my roommate, and his girlfriend) all enjoy XCOM, but we only own one disk. A few days ago, we came up with a way to involve everybody off a single console. 

Basically, every ""player"" controls one soldier. At the start of the game, you pick one rookie, name it after yourself, customize it to your hearts content, and then play that rookie through the entire rest of the game. Each turn consists of you moving your soldier (and ONLY your soldier) and then handing the controller off to the next player.

I will admit it has some downsides. We've been playing with only 3 people, and we do realize the only reason we're alive is because we're playing on easy (it was an experiment, not supposed to be a challenge.) Before you research S.H.I.V.s, losing one of your 3 soldiers to sickbay means you're now running a mission with a severely understrength squad. We play that if one of the people isn't available to play, their soldier cannot join missions.

The upside, and the reason we keep playing it, is it makes you INCREDIBLY attached to your soldiers. I have never been so worried as when my soldier was flanked by a muton, and none of my buddies were in range to help me. I've crafted my lone soldier all the way from recruit to colonel, and I've never felt more protective of any soldier in XCOM before. 

I'm rambling a bit now, but I thought it was an interesting enough variation of play that I'd share it with you guys. 

tl;dr everyone gets just one soldier. Don't die.

Its pretty simple, you login with Facebook and it pulls down the names.  You click the button, save the file, and replace the default one in the game installation directory.  Remember to make a backup so you can get your old names back.

The main problem is that you can't pick male names for male soldiers and female names for female soldiers.  You end with weird names a lot of times.  I find that its still fun anyway though.

1) The Tier 2 Heavy Ability ""Bullet Swarm"" reads like it just lets you move after firing.  This is incorrect.  Bullet Swarm will allow you to FIRE TWICE in a turn, or any combination of two actions.

2)Arc throwers work MUCH better if the target is at 3 or less health.

3) If you take damage that is LESS than the bonus provided by your armor your soldier will NOT go to medical bay.

4) ""Training"" does not unequip your soldiers.  Death and Medical bay does.

5) Regional bonuses apply REGARDLESS of where you built your base.  You just need sats over every country on the continent.

6) On at least Classic difficulty: Civilians off screen WILL turn into zombies regardless of enemies present.

I've had two soldiers with me through the entire campaign that survived through it all; Ross 'Mad Dog' Meyers, my assault and Xenia 'Snake Eyes' Garza, my sniper. Meyers was always my favorite from the start and he would have been my volunteer but his will power was low from so many close calls in the many missions he had been on. Garza was the one I always considered my leader and, being the sniper, had the highest will so she was chosen instead. 

On the last mission, in the last room. My squad was injured from the trials before and were fighting with everything they had. In a single turn, the aliens took down three good soldiers; my support, an assault and my heavy. All that were left standing were my SHIV, Garza and Mad Dog. They were all wounded quite severely and I knew this would be my final turn. It was all or nothing. I sent Mad Dog straight at the leader in a final rush; used run and gun to get him a step away; he got one good shot in but the other was reflected. The leader was still at half health. My SHIV was engaged on the other side of the room but I moved it as close I could to make the shot. It missed. It was all up to Garza now; she had to make the shot or it was over. She lined up her shot and bang. She had done it. 

The final cut scene was straight out of a movie. Garza and Meyers, two soldiers who had fought side by side through everything; the only survivors of the final attack on the alien ship are forced to separate. Garza makes the ultimate sacrifice while Meyers is forced to leave his leader and friend to escape the doomed ship.

*Dan ""Mad Dan"" O'Malley was hugged by a Chryssalid.*

*John ""Mr Clean"" Mitchell sacrificed himself to heal a critically wounded squadmate.*

*Keiran ""Cyclops"" Kerrigan committed suicide from confusion over his multiple name references.*



...and you know you won't see them again.    Or could you?

Gentlemen, we can rebuild them, we have the technology.

Mod Idea:  A Cyborg Creation Mod.

General Concept:

You bring a soldier back from the dead in a weakened state, but over the long term they can become more powerful than they originally were.   

Requirements:

1. The Soldier must be a Major or higher. The council wouldn't want their funds wasted on a rookie.

2. You must have a Foundry. This is, after all, an improvement of an existing item. (Corpse)

3. You must have the S.H.I.V. researched.

4. You must have autopsied all Floaters.

5. You must have Cyborg Resurrection Researched. (New research provided by the mod.)

6. You must have the corpse. (Not sure if this would be possible to mod, but a way to ""recover"" and preserve a soldier's body after they are killed and bring it back to the Insertion Point.)

End Result:

You are given a reskinned Soldier of the same class with the same name.  They have the following attributes:

1. They revert to Rank 3--it's tough to remember the skills they were taught.

2. They gain experience at half the rate of human squad members.

3. They, like the S.H.I.V., are immune to psy attacks.

4. If wounded, they recover twice as fast at base to be ready for combat.

5. If they die again, they cannot be rebuilt again.


End Result: You have a trooper that is stronger than a normal one, but takes extra effort to get back at full strength. (And extra time/resources for the research.)

Scroll to the right and now we see him.  We have to move him first but how can we be sure the he can see the alien after moving?  Move him furthest near the newbie sniper (who just missed) should work but then they may eat a grenade in the next turn.

http://i.imgur.com/qihD7.jpg

We can use those red shield ""you will be flanked!"" warnings to estimate.  Red shield means the alien can see and shot your unit if he moves to that tile, but it also mean your unit can see and shot back.  In this example, tile B is certainly in range and tile A is likely to be in range, while tile C, D and E are certainly out of range.  

This method can also be used to check if a tall structure or stopping at the ramp may obscure the line of sight.  You cannot use this method if the aliens are only Berserker or Chryssalid since they cannot shot.  The info you get is an estimate but can be quite reliable.

I'm not a millionaire but I am happy to buy the winner any under $10 game they want from steam and buy the runner up any game on steam under $5. 

We would need 8 people at the minimum if you would like to participate leave a comment and an upvote for visibility and I will message you your opponent within the next 24 hours.

Matches will be played with 10000 points, 90 second turns and the map will be pulled out of a hat and sent to you with your opponent, you'll need to communicate with your opponent and set up a time to play within 24 hours of my contact or it will be considered a double forfeit. If you're opponent doesn't log on for an agreed upon time let me know and they will be considered forfeited. 

P.S Youtubers welcome, I will be broadcasting my match(es).

P.P.S Hey guys, I've noticed some upvotes going on but no comments, just making sure everyone knows that if you want to participate you need to leave a comment, if there is a way to see who liked your post I don't know it.

Since there's a modding nexus already up, I'm optimistic. Any reason why this wouldn't be doable?

They scale poorly past the early game, they have the same spawn locations every time, and the scripted NPCs feel very Not-Xcom.

That said, playing through Classic, I found the bomb missions to be interesting and exciting.  You had to be a bit aggressive, you had to take calculated risks, and I didn't understand why people disliked them.

Their big design problem is that the location-time-pressure is basically impossible to balance.  Mid game, with 50% more people on your squad, you can realistically designate one or two as 'defuser guys' whose primary mission is to hit the nodes while everyone else mops up the aliens.  But with 4 people it's really rough.

Recently I've been trying to get into impossible, though, and an early game bomb mission there is just stupid.  The beginning part was really interesting and fun--the same risky moves, where it could go either way.  I spent several turns 1-turn-away-from-exploding, just barely making it to the next power node while beating off the sectoids and single thinman spawn.  I lost one squadmember and another was hanging on at 1hp, but I managed to eke out a half turn on one of my heavies to heal her.  If one or two die rolls had gone the other way, I would have had to bug out, or possibly even lost outright.

Then I defused the bomb.  And the game spawns 24 hp of aliens on overwatch on top of me.  WTF?

I take out two from my position, using my last grenade (there's some weird flanking bugs for the teleporting-in thin men, too, by the way; they seem to get cover even when the cover isn't facing the right direction), one of the other two flanks my medkit guy and kills him, and the last manages to hit my remaining two troops with poison.  From there it's basically game over.

Now I see why people say to immediately abort bomb missions on impossible.  I don't think it's at all possible to win there, even with better luck.

I'm not sure what the point of that last spawn is, anyways--even playing normal/classic, it's the least interesting part of the mission.  You've already run the gauntlet to defuse the bomb, that seems like a climactic finish, but then there's this extra stupid 'cleanup' afterwards that basically only serves to punish early game squads.",,False,self,t5_2si6x,1355223318.0,,,True,t3_14nrdr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/14nrdr/whoever_tuned_council_missions_on_impossible_is_a/,
1353319726.0,41,self.Xcom,13g130,Early game build order for classic\impossible,48,7,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/13g130/early_game_build_order_for_classicimpossible/,"Hi, I just wanted to share some of my strategy thoughts regarding the early game.

I’ve used this tactic to a great success – finished classic ironman and now making my way through impossible (about to assault alien base, have all available satellites, 3 continent bonuses, most needed foundry\officer school upgrades and light plasma for all squads on month 4)

So here goes:

**Starting place:**

Choose either Africa or South America as starting point, tracking the one you do not choose as primary target for satellites. Africa gives a straight up awesome +30% monthly funding, while South America’s research boost is awesome for teching. I feel that choosing Africa is a little better, as it is easier to cap South America (only two countries).  

**Research timing:**

Our goal here is to rush to laser weapon tech, as a couple of rifles make battles a lot easier on classic and are practically a must to survive terror on impossible. With that aim in mind:

1)	Choose weapon fragments as the first research. As well as being necessary for laser, it also gives a straight up boost in term of a Scope (you should really consider it for a sniper and maybe heavy straight away).  

2)	You can only research laser after your first UFO mission. Before that get started on alien materials, but switch to laser as soon as it becomes available.

3)	When you get laser start on the alien capture tree. Get Alien Biology and arc thrower and start raking in the captives

4)	Do not research any bodies\make interrogations until you get the South Africa bonus. If everything goes well you should get it by the end of the second month.  When you do go through all the autopsies and interrogations (they will be instant). 

5)	After the interrogations are done you should have earned good credit on many research fields. Start working on alien materials and get carapace armor.

6)	Next is tricky. If you were good with your captures you should have bunch of light plasma rifles by now. However, the research timing for light plasma without the Muton interrogation bonus is much too high (35 days for me), so don’t start it until you can get one of those guys.

7)	Meanwhile start working on the advanced fighter craft tech (alien computer, alien power source, new fighter craft) – you would really need it starting from month 4 to get the bigger baddies down. However, once you get your hands on a Muton, get back to those light plasma. 

8)	By now every one of your guys should have carapace, scopes and light plasma. I do not get laser weapons for heavies and snipers, going straight for plasma. This build should keep you pretty comfortable in the field, so now your task is to get air superiority ASAP. I suggest researching plasma cannons (you can get it after light plasma) and new fighter craft. 

9)	After that you can pretty much relax. Get plasma, plasma sniper and plasma heavy to fully kit out the squad. Titan armor next for hp. Afterwards – up to you

**Production**
	**General base layout\production\mission tips:**

1)	For maximum efficiency you want to plan your sat uplinks  to form a square (yep, you get the adjacency bonus for vertical links, not just horizontal). So the layout should look something like this:

X  S  S  L  X  X  X

X  S  S  L  X  X  X

2)	Satellite uplinks take 15 days to build. The number of satellites only counts during council review at the end of the month, so there is really no point to build them earlier than when there is 15 days remaining till the end of the month. The main limiting resource for a satellite uplink is the number of engineers. 

3)	Satellites take 20 days to build. Never start a satellite earlier than 20 days before the end of the month, as you might get missions\request that grant you engineers, which would make the production cheaper. Plan ahead and only order that many satellites that you will be able to support with uplinks at the end of the month (don’t forget to account for adjacency bonus). 

4)	When choosing abduction missions try to always go for engineers as they are vital to keep your uplink production up. Other matters to consider are countries – try not to go to countries that you plan to cover with satellites this month, as the panic there would be reduced anyway. Apart from South America and Africa try to get Asia bonus, as it will really help in mid-game.

**Month 1**

1)	After the initial mission check out you base layout. If there is a stream vent in close proximity (no more than 1 level down and 2 drills away) go for it. Otherwise get a normal generator, making sure to place it away from your first uplink

2)	 Do not start any satellites\uplinks yet. Wait for the first abduction, choose engineers. When there are 20 days left till the end of the first month order a satellite (you need 10 engineers for the first uplink, so you would probably not get it in the first month). 

3)	After the first UFO raid sell all computers\power sources. They won’t be necessary for a while and rake up quite a bit of cash

4)	At the end of the first month use the satellite to either save one of the South America\Asia countries or, if you are lucky and these did not get affected, go for the one with the biggest income.

**Month 2**

1)	Again, wait for the abduction mission to come before making satellites. If it does not come until the 20 day mark, order 3 satellites anyway. 

2)	Sell all UFO loot from month 2 as well to fund the activity.

3)	By now you should get your laser rifles research finished. Kit out your squad (usually alloys would be the restricting point, not cash)

4)	Make sure you get enough gens to power the upcoming uplink

5)	When 15 days are left you should definitely get the second abduction. Get Engineers and order the second uplink, adjacent to the first.

6)	Do not start an officer school yet. You won’t be able to afford anything.

7)	You can get an alien containment though. Sell some corpses if you have to (on impossible selling corpses is actually really good, as you get a lot of them)

8)	At the end of the month you will have 3 satellites ready to launch. This should be enough to get South America and to placate another country. Start working towards Asia

9)	As soon as you get South America get ready for a huge knowledge boost – research all bodies and interrogate all the aliens you have got.

**Month 3**

1)	Well, now we finally have some breathing room. 5 countries with Africa bonus should net you 450-500 income, so we finally got some cash to spend. 

2)	Keep satellite\uplink production in check (you should send out 3 more at the end of this month), but get an officer school for that squad size (if you can get Asia this month do not buy any other upgrades). 

3)	Get a bunch of interceptors (at least 2) in all areas under control

4)	By now you should have researched carapace, so kit your guys out with that. 

**Month 4**

1)	If all went well you should have 8 countries under control which means a lot of funding.  Get the foundry (reload and first aid are a must; arc upgrade is good for raking in Mutons for heavy &amp; normal plasma). 

2)	Get max squad size, iron will and other stuff from officer school.

3)	By now you should really be struggling with UFOs. Get a lot of interceptors and do no be afraid to pop a couple of power-ups for each battle. 

4)	Work towards the final uplink. You shouldn’t need more than 4 on impossible. On classic consider getting a nexus.

5)	You should be able to kit your guys with looted light plasma. After that concentrate your research on ships

**Month 5**

1)	If you made it this far you should be ok. By now you should have a 1200+ income, so go crazy. Get heavy plasma, sniper plasma, titan armor and lot’s of new ships.

so i loaded the 6 shivs into the skyranger and off they went to mexico. after a few turns inching forward, i came across a squad of heavy floaters. i lost one shiv when a car exploded and the rest of my shivs could barely land a shot while so far away and in cover, so i came up with a new strategy. full on assault. get as close as possible and cover be damned.

i was not expecting to survive the mission, but i wanted to see how far i could get. so the shivs advance, uncovering 2 squads of 2 mutons and a berserker each, and another squad of heavy floaters. both sides take casualties after several turns. with some luck, it ended up being 2 shivs left, both with 1 HP against 1 muton.

the first shiv moves into position, and misses. the 2nd shiv fires and hits but doesn't kill. the muton blows the closer shiv apart. last turn, i know i can win. all i have to do is move the last shiv right up close and fire, so i do. and i miss! all that for nothing i'm thinking. i was that close. so alien activity happens. i accept my fate. the muton turns, fires, and misses too! with an unbelievable stroke of luck, my shiv fires on the next turn, kills the muton and ends the misson. and that's my tale of a 6 shiv terror mission that i pulled out by the skin of my teeth. one of my best x-com moments to date.

all my shivs are dead, except for thunder-6. that little guy deserves a promotion.

TLDR - took 6 shivs on a terror mission to mexico. won the mission with 1 shiv left at 1 hp after improbable circumstances.",,False,self,t5_2si6x,False,,,True,t3_12uunc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/12uunc/terror_mission_with_6_shivs_story/,

OK, Archangel for Squad Sight Snipers is obvious, but for everyone else, Ghost is just incredibly useful in so many ways.

- Scouting. You do not activate enemies while stealthed, which makes it trivial to set up devastating ambush attacks like firing rockets into un-activated groups or positioning Close Combat Specialist Assault soldiers in the middle of the enemy pack for multiple free hits. This is honestly game-breaking because it circumvents or takes advantage of the enemies' ""free move"" mechanic.

- Defense. Ghost armor is the ultimate ""oh shit"" button, as it renders you 100% invulnerable to all targeted attacks for one turn. It costs no time to activate and takes effect immediately. The only thing I've found that makes it not work is standing literally right on top of an enemy while not in cover. (The enemy happened to be an Ethereal, not sure if that matters.) It doesn't have the added health of, say, Titan Armor, but it more than makes up for that with stealth defense. Your guy got MC'd and you regained control surrounded by muton elites? No problem. You misclicked, jumped off a platform and now you're face-to-face with a sectopod? No problem. The only way I've had anyone die in Ghost Armor was if they ran out of stealth charges.

- Offense. Ghost Armored Heavies with Bullet Swarm, Ghost Armored Assaults with Close Combat Specialist and Rapid Fire, Ghost Armored Supports with Sprint, hell, even Ghost Armored Snipers with Snap Shot would be worth trying. You can clear the most tenaciously defended enemy positions very, very easily when you can flank them with total impunity.

I get that it's supposed to be a powerful item and limited by number of charges, but I've found 4 to be more than sufficient for the vast majority of missions if I rotate scouting duties and don't spend them frivolously. Anyway, I currently give this armor to everyone who isn't a Squad Sight Sniper and have had extremely good success with it. Just wondered if anyone else felt the same since I haven't seen it discussed much. Granted it's a near-endgame piece, but still.

I started on Normal and the beginning of the game is a real struggle.  I made some major mistakes and wasted a ton of cash.  I figured I'd just play until I lost and restart and do better with my new experience.  Well, I somehow managed to claw my way back to a respectable position (though cash is *always* lacking) and I think I have a chance of taking this to the end.

I love how balancing resources is just a part of the challenge (or more so) as fighting aliens.

I wish I had purchased it on launch.  Did it sell well enough to get a sequel?

Also, fuck those Muton dudes.

1350884567.0,44,self.Xcom,11vt9e,Impossible tactical discussion,52,8,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/11vt9e/impossible_tactical_discussion/,"I have yet to beat Ironman Impossible, despite getting close to the ""tipping point"" a couple of times, and I thought I'd start a thread for everyone to share their tips on the tactical side specifically. The strategic layer of Impossible is probably the most different from Classic in the sense that managing global panic is much more difficult, but the game is won or lost on the tactical map.

When I first moved up to Impossible, my feeling was basically ""This is bullshit."" It seemed like a game of pure RNG where winning battles came down to getting repeatedly lucky on weighted dice. I've come to realize that this isn't really true, or at least, it's no more true than it is on any other difficulty. You *can* dramatically influence the odds with smart play, and I've gotten much better at the game over the course of many failed II attempts. Here are a few of the things I've figured out.

**Full cover isn't worth much.** The combination of the aliens' superior numbers, weapons, and aim means they will *always* win a long-distance firefight of attrition, even if all your soldiers are in full cover. Rather than digging in and shooting it out, what you want to do is minimize the number of shots enemies get to take, either by killing them quickly or by staying completely out of their line of sight. Putting a soldier in the line of fire is a big risk that must be justified by the possibility of a big reward. For example, it may seem tempting to park your soldier behind a truck in full cover to take 45-50% potshots at an alien in partial cover, but that is not an adequate management of risk, unless you can do it with several soldiers on a lone enemy in the same turn. The computer can lose that sectoid or muton and still have plenty of firepower left, but if you lose 25%, 20%, or even 16.66% of your squad, it can be devastating; and if 2+ aliens are shooting at one soldier, he will likely be hit no matter what his defensive position. You need to play in a style that a poker player would call ""tight aggressive"", meaning you watch patiently for opportunities and then capitalize on them to the max. Coordinated assaults are key (e.g. destroy enemy cover, then have everyone else move into LOS and shoot while they are exposed).

**Be aware of potential spawns.** Familiarity with the maps helps a lot here, as you'll know the likely locations of enemies ahead of time. The main thing to keep in mind is that anytime you uncover a map tile, you run the risk of bringing more enemies into the fight. People will say this means you ""can't flank"" or maneuver properly, but that isn't really true. You *can* maneuver, and in fact you have to maneuver to win, but you have to be careful about it. For example, don't send your Assault guy on a flanking Run &amp; Gun charge into an unexplored corner. One thing that helps is to try to fight on the edges of maps when you can -- when conducting your initial exploration, head down the side rather than up the middle, and enter buildings by the back doors. The sides of the map are safe from spawning enemies, so you limit your risk of pulling multiple packs. Patrols will show up, of course, and if you suspect you are on a patrol route, it can be best to just stay put and Overwatch for a few turns to draw them out. On UFO missions, don't head straight for the UFO, but explore the rest of the map first. Sometimes it can be tedious, but it's a hell of a lot more tedious to restart the game for the umpteenth time.

**Use Overwatch intelligently.** Don't Overwatch just because you have nothing better to do. If you are in an alien's LOS and can't/don't want to take the shot, it is almost always better to either move or hunker down. Overwatching visible enemies makes them less likely to move from their position, which can be bad. Understand the exact mechanics of Overwatch and what shots you'll be able to take -- for example, Overwatching the corner of a building or other likely cover spot isn't helpful if you expect an unseen enemy to move *into* that cover. Overwatch triggers when you see something move out of, not into, a tile. OTOH, Overwatch is extremely useful when exploring and is the main reason you should have your entire squad together while doing so. Getting 3 or 4 reaction shots on a patrol that moves into view can make all the difference.

**Abuse explosives.** One might think that grenades and rockets would be less valuable in Impossible given the enemies' increased health, but one would be wrong. Explosives are extremely useful for destroying cover, for creating entrances/exits in buildings, for damaging groups of enemies, and for dealing damage without putting yourself in LOS (the long range of rockets is indispensable for this). Tell Dr. Vahlen to shut her pie hole about ""using restraint"" -- all you lose by killing enemies with explosives is a few weapon fragments, which are, believe me, *not* in short supply on Impossible.

**Have a backup plan.** Move order for your soldiers is crucial on Impossible. In general, you want to take the riskiest/most important move first, such as a stun attempt or a 70% flanking shot that *should* kill a particular enemy, so you can adjust your plan if it fails. Maybe you Run &amp; Gun that alien instead of the one you were hoping to. Try never to put yourself in situations where you *must* make a shot or else someone dies, although this is sometimes unavoidable.

**All soldiers are not created equal.** I get the most use out of the Heavy and Assault classes on Impossible. Heavies excel at taking out huge swaths of enemies/enemy cover, plus they get a shoot-twice ability (Bullet Swarm) at very low rank. Assault soldiers are great for targeted kills against dug-in opponents and for soaking reaction fire with Lightning Reflexes. Both of them rank up quickly due to their offensive focus. Snipers and Support don't get most of their really good talents until higher rank, which is hard to achieve, and I have a hell of a time getting Support in particular to gain rank. I will go far out of my way to protect Assault/Heavy soldiers of Corporal rank or higher, even throwing the aliens a free rookie to kill instead if I have to.

**Failure IS an option.** On the topic of protecting soldiers, if a mission goes bad early and you still have high-value troops left, it's OK to bug out. Maybe you lose a country or a monetary reward, but the loss is probably not unrecoverable; losing your best soldiers can be. High-ranked soldiers are always the resource in shortest supply on Impossible.

**Don't get frustrated.** You will have really bad turns occasionally. Your captain will miss a 96% shot and get smoked, making your rookie panic and kill a sergeant. This sort of thing happens with a great deal more frequency in Impossible than Classic, and if you let it throw you off your game, you will lose battles you might have won. It's never over 'til it's over, and the nice thing about turn-based games is you can easily step away from the computer for a while and come back when you know you're thinking clearly.

**Miscellaneous tips.**  

* Switch to pistol to kill enemies with 1 health left. Also, switch to pistol at the end of the turn if you think a soldier may panic with no enemies in sight. Much better to shoot a friendly with a pistol than a laser rifle.  
* Always reload and wait for cooldowns before looking for more enemies.
* Keep track of who has killed what and who has earned a promotion already. Soldiers never promote more than one rank in a mission, so it's better to spread kills around, provided you can do so without taking on additional risk.  
* It's very, very important to take your time on council missions. The game tries to create a sense of urgency by having NPCs yell at you, but this is a ruse to make you sloppy. Be methodical. You really need to win these, and one mistake can cost the game. Thin Men are *extremely* dangerous on Impossible due to their +10 aim from light plasma and their natural crit buff.  
* Have a complete understanding of cover/flanking mechanics. This almost goes without saying, although it's possible to win on Normal/Classic without knowing the system all that well.  
* Get the Officer School the second it becomes available. IMO this is an even higher priority than satellite coverage. Squad size increases are the single most important thing you can do to improve your tactical chances.",,False,self,t5_2si6x,False,,,True,t3_11vt9e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/11vt9e/impossible_tactical_discussion/,

I think this is too good and name the sniper after myself and the heavy after my Belgian GF and tweak both of them to look like us and decide, okay these two are my core. At this point I start giving my GF a running commentary.

It's all going well with a few tight spots but we pull through, sometimes using our squaddies as meat shields. When Brasil had a terror mission. I have ""Ice"" (me) with squad sight watching over with ""Brick"" (gf) providing van guard and 3 squaddies punching forward. 

Floaters and Chrysalids out of NOWHERE! Floater pops up in the air descending on ""Brick"" in the van (my GF). Suddenly surrounded by Chrysalids and I can't snipe them fast enough. I'm furiously narrating this to her while I try save her. Finally I'm like sorry but I can't let you be a zombie and grenade her... all while narrating it to her.

Yeah telling my lovely GF how I led her down a dark alley along, watching from afar as hideous nightmarish aliens stabbed her and tried to impregnate her with their alien spawn before blowing her up myself, with a grenade.

Realizing this really ruined the tension of combat. Aliens can never ambush you. If you have not spotted them before there is absolutely no chance that aliens will shoot you next turn. You can specially notice this when taking UFO. In old ones opening the door was scary since you could get reaction fire instant you opened it.

My forces were weary entering the final chamber. My volunteer used rift to take care of the heavies that were sitting out front. When the three ethereals came out, we knew we were toast. My heavy gunner was mind controlled immediately, and unfortunately, had to be eliminated because the mind control wipe by my volunteer failed. After sitting tight, using ghost, and hunker down, allowing them to advance my volunteer used mind control on the closest ethereal taking control! After pushing back the final two villains and casting rift on the two who had grouped, the first one blew up killing mine and damaging the third, when my mind controlled ethereal died his explosion killed the third.

I may have accidentally stumbled into an effective strategy here - within every 6 man squad, I now operate with mid-high level shotgun-assault, who is my designated risk-taker. 

This came about because I had a surplus of mid-high level assaults, one of whom had suffered a serious wound that left her Will in the 40s. I never liked her that much, so I decided I'd get the most use out of her remaining days instead of firing her. For safety's sake, I always deployed her furthest away from the crux of my squad (panic fires), and fitted her with heavy hitting firearms (alloy cannon). From that point on, my ""Risker"" took on every high risk/high reward move I had available. Basically all the crap I'd try to pull on normal, that'd I'm too risk adverse to try on Classic.

And you know what? She died. But she survived 8 drops and made some spectacular kills - multiple sectopods, at least one ethereal, solo'd a squad of mutons + berserker support. I was real proud of her. 

And that's what I'm utilizing from now on, every squad incorporates one shotgun-assault, who's job is to kick in doors and get shot to hell.

For the most part, we showed off similar footage from our previous PR tour and we used a Commando and Engineer to help Carter defeat the invading alien resistance. 

For IGN, we did something special and showed off a lot of new things for the first time. This section takes place later in the game (as you can tell by Carter's new powers and the shiny new weapons) and for this, we decided to show off the Recon and Support agents.

In the zone allows a sniper to take a free shot on a flanked/no cover enemy, provided that you kill him. Reminds me of cleave in DnD.

Colonel Richard Jones, a veteran of over 20 missions, was killed in battle by a pair of Muton Elites as our brave soldiers stormed an Enemy Vessel that was shot down over Canada. His field medic duties saved the lives of countless men and women and he was known for keeping a watchful eye on his squad mates, ready to bail them out of trouble at a moment's notice. 

On his previous mission, his quick thinking under heavy opposition aboard a downed enemy battleship not only turned around a losing battle, but ensured that every unit there with him came home alive, if a little worse for wear. He, himself, suffered serious injuries during that engagement, but he never stopped coming to the aid of others.

While he is not survived by any immediate family members, ""Pops"", as he was endearingly called by many of the younger soldiers, considered his fellow men and women at X-COM his family. Of particular note was his student and protege Vladimir ""Mr. Clean"" Solokov. 

""He was like a father to me,"" Solokov said, struggling to find words. ""A hero, larger than life. Everybody knew of him and his exploits in battle. Hell, the majority of us probably wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for him in some way."" 

The war with the extraterrestrials rages on, however, and there is no time for mourning on the battlefield. X-COM's fearless troops continue to train and prepare for the next mission, despite their heavy hearts.

Here's the jist of it

* Light plasma rifle + scope + rapid fire (double shot): you get 20% per shot which offset the -15% penalty. This is really strong when combined with any buff to shooting.

* Agression (+10% crit per enemy in sight) instead of tactical sense (+5 def per enemy in sight): This is kinda up to your preference, I prefer to stack more on the strength of rapid fire, you get +10% crit per enemy in sight each shot.

* lightning reflex (duh)

* Bring 'em on (+1 ~~dmg~~ **crit dmg** per enemy in squad sight) instead of close combat specialist: Even with the shotgun close ranged assaults, close combat specialist don't get used that often (unless you like to abuse that particular tactic with ghost armor). Bring 'em on gives you bonus dmg (x2) every time you shoot. Also you still have run&amp;gun in the rare cases where you have to get somewhere far and still overwatch.

Note that when you rapid fire someone to the face you'll most likely crit twice (just like the shotties assault) and because of Bring 'em on you'll do similar dmg. Also, note that before ammo conservation project you only have 4 shots with the light plasma rifle, so after 2 rapid fire you have to reload but this is not a big deal, also heavies are just as bad.

I've been playing on classic ironman with much success with the ""light plasma rifle assaults"". On Impossible ironman, it's just a ticking timebomb before multiple wipeouts defeat me, but that's nothing to do with long ranged vs short ranged assault.

**edit** I didn't realize bring 'em on adds crit dmg instead of dmg, I'll have to rethink on things. But two things: Agression may be well worth it; and I didn't notice because I was critting a lot and killing things with rapid fire often. So just be wary and use your own judgement.",,False,self,t5_2si6x,1351807827.0,,,True,t3_12g9xn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/12g9xn/light_plasma_rifle_assaults/,

On May 18th, at the end of OP CRYPTIC RAIN, where our XCom operatives rescued Anna Sung from the Alien Menace in Lagos, Nigeria, we returned to find a parking ticket on our Skyranger.

You may remember that on May 8th, while we were rescuing the city of Montreal, Canada, from the grips of Alien Terror we found two men trying to tow the Skyranger, and were forced to pay a $100 ""drop fee."" That drop fee slowed the production of new Nano-Fiber Vests, and had a direct impact on XCom operative safety.

Finally, Argentina, a valuable member of the XCom Council, departed from the Council on April 30th. Cited in their document was a parking fine that was two months in arrears, for when our Skyranger illegally blocked a fire lane, a loading zone, and two parking spots in March on OP PATIENT EMPIRE.

Central Officer Bradford. Deal with this issue immediately.

Still playing classic ironman but things like having different base layouts, starting on a different continent, randomized missions and requests from countries are making this feel like a whole new game.

For example, had a steam vent in the space beside the lift on the second level first time through and it made power a joke, this time not so much.  

Another is I'm struggling with having enough alloys to build stuff this time through even though I never once ran into that problem last playthrough. I think it's due to having a lot of countries ask for laser weapons early on, which was awesome because I got a ton of cash, but now I can't even build myself plasma weapons and I'm falling behind tech wise in the fights. Should be able to fix this with the 5 workshops I have pending but right now its a struggle.

Anyway, just wanted to comment on this and see how others are feeling about it. You don't even have to up the difficulty if you find the current one challenging and can definitely enjoy subsequent playthroughs.

One thing I liked to see that was kind of in the Second Wave options is not only new Economy so the country funding is randomized, but new Geospecialization so the bonuses are switched up.

Honestly I've been hesitant to even get into Classic anymore after actually having *fun* while playing Normal because I can trust my guys to actually act like highly trained soldiers. Anyways, this:

It’s a brilliant game, but I do have some complaints. Like most people, I started off the game on Classic mode, which is supposed to be the same difficulty as the original X-COM. The problem is that it is difficult, but it’s not difficult in the right areas. The AI does get smarter, yes, but the game also messes with the percent chances for you to hit and be hit. As a result you get the feeling that you’re not really fighting a smarter enemy, Firaxis just skewed the dice against you and called it “hard”. And it is hard, believe me. But winning in it doesn’t feel like an accomplishment as much as pure luck. Your highly-trained and competent soldiers from Normal turn into bumbling idiots that can’t hit an alien three feet away. These are supposed to be the best of the best of the best that Earth has to offer, but unless you use liberal flanking then your shots are going to go wide. And flanking is not as easy as you might think. Due to the Fog Of War mechanics, circling around a squad of aliens can be more dangerous than just taking your chances with 30% chance to hit shots, as you might activate another squad and get completely overwhelmed. It’s not unplayable, but it makes me shy away from Classic mode. Unfortunately, Normal is pretty easy, with the aliens frequently making really stupid tactical mistakes, so there’s really no happy middle.

Another issue I have is the concept of “Overwatch”. Basically, it’s an action your soldier can do where they get one free “Reaction shot” against enemies that move in their field of view first. While this seems like an awesome  thing, it’s frustratingly worthless in the sense that the shots never hit. You can have a gigantic alien streaking through a field of six soldiers with Overwatch enabled and get nothing but six Miss indicators far more frequently than I would like. While I assume this is a Working As Intended thing on the part of Firaxis, it’s very annoying.

Also, it’s buggy. I’m sure it will all be patched out later, but in a game where valuable soldiers live and die in single moves you really can’t have bugs like this. I’ve had soldiers looking into a brick wall instead of being able to shoot at the alien that’s literally on the other side of the corner. I’ve had gigantic deadly melee units standing on the middle of ramps that are visible for the soldiers below them, but not the ones standing ones square away above them on the ramp. I’ve had heavy mobile soldiers pop into existence in the middle of my squad with no warning or reason. I’ve had extraction zones just disappear, which is not good when your squad is barely holding it together and need to NOPE their way to safety. Instead my remaining officers just got to do a heroic last stand that accomplished nothing. The majority of the game is polished, but again. In a game with permadeath like this, this shit can’t happen.

EDIT: Hit, not miss

EDIT2: Really, I'm not ragging on the game. I love it to death. If you want proof, here's the whole thing I clipped this out of: (http://cafetroph.tumblr.com/post/33521866326/xcom). *And* I just finished the game on Ironman Normal.

Therefore, I started a new game on Classic Ironman. And another. And another. (By the way, I don't recommend the Slingshot missions on that difficulty...)

With practice, I've been getting a lot better at this. My casualty rate has dropped considerably, and I'm actually getting ""good"" at this. (Rule #1 of XCOM : don't be complacent, I know...) However, this last game was an absolute disaster. I lost almost my entire squad on the first mission, failed the first council mission (rookie killed VIP...), I was going to lose Egypt and France because of a miscalculation...

Things looked grim, and things got worse. My first terror mission happened. I was barely recovering with my new team, and I felt like this was going to be my end. The line would be drawn in Argentina.

The team? Two heavies, a rookie and an assault. At the very least, I had firepower. The location? The ""museum"" map (actually it's probably more a library).

They moved slowly to a side entrance and then breached it, only to find two chryssalids chilling on the other side. One of them was quickly dispatched, the other was badly hurt. On its turn, it killed a single civilian... and things went bad. Two floaters on the second floor floated into sight.

At this point, a part of me said : ""Oh no. I'm not going to let a few floaters bully me. It ends now."" On this fourth turn, I would make a stand. I wouldn't let my guys get murdered by floaters while trying to save civilians. In true XCOM manner, I used excessive force and sent a rocket flying right into their ugly alien faces. I thought losing 3-4 civilians was worth not failing this mission completely. And guess what, when the rocket exploded, it showed 5 damage indicators. The floater threat was eliminated for now, at the cost of some ""collateral"" damage. The chryssalid was then easily dispatched by the rest of the team.

The mission ended right there, much to my surprise. Furthermore, I finally got the ""As a scalpel"" achievement (excellent rating on all aspect of a terror mission). At Classic Ironman difficulty! In an incredible turn of luck, that rocket didn't kill civilians, but three additional floaters instead!

Ever since that mission, the XCOM project has been running stronger than ever. Half the countries in the world have satellites, laser weapon fabrication is ongoing and my soldiers are almost ready to assault the alien base. 

A game that started so poorly is ending up being my best attempt yet at completing the game on Classic Ironman.

So I did a bunch of testing because it seems like theres really not that much online yet about what works and what doesn't.

To edit a .ini file, open it up in your My Games &gt; XCOM Enemy Unknown &gt; XComGame &gt; config and open up XComEngine.ini.

Reduce mouse lag; **OneFrameThreadLag=TRUE** set this to FALSE to fix mouse lag issues.

_________________________________________
FPS Tweaks - these are their DEFAULT VALUES;

**DynamicDecals=True** (set to False; 1-2 FPS gain)

**DynamicLights=True** (set to False but not recommended, some lights are not rendered like on aliens; 4-5 FPS gain)

**DynamicShadows=True** (set to False, recommended for performance; 5-8 FPS gain)

**DynamicShadowsFromDominantLights=True** (set to False, recommended)

**LightEnvironmentShadows=True** (set to False, recommended)

**CompositeDynamicLights=True** (set to False, not so recommended, you'll lose a lot of lights like street lights and such, decent performance gain though)

**MotionBlur=True** (set to False, recommended for performance)

**Bloom=True** (set to False, not recommended, little performance gain to visual ratio)

**bAllowLightShafts=True** (set to False, recommended)

**Distortion=True** (set to False, highly recommended for low end video cards)

**DropParticleDistortion=False** (set to True, same as above)

**bAllowDownsampledTranslucency=False** (haven't noticed anything bad with this one, set to True for performance)

**FXAAQuality=X** (set to any number BESIDES 0, or else you'll crash, 1 is for performance, recommended)

**FogVolumes=True** (set to False, HIGHLY recommended, great for performance)

**UseVsync=True** (self explanatory, if you have lag issues, keep it off and set to False)

**AllowRadialBlur=True** (set to False, recommended, small performance increase)

**AllowImageReflections=True** (set to False, almost no reduction in quality I've seen)

**AllowImageReflectionShadowing** (same as above)

**ParticleLODBias=X** (set to any number, the higher the better for performance, eg. 2000000 is good, recommended)

**DetailMode=X** (the lower the number, the less visual things on the screen like particles and such, a number like 1 is usually good for performance to visual ratio)

**MaxMultiSamples=X** (set to 0 for performance, jaggies)

**MaxWholeSceneDominantShadowResolution=X** (set to 128 for performance, little visual tradeoff)

**MaxShadowResolution=X** (same as above)

**ScreenPercentage=100.00** (CAREFUL WITH THIS ONE, this gives you MASSIVE performance the lower the number, but will cause a lot of jaggies/blurred gameplay, for now unless you're barely playable, keep at 100)

__________________________________
FPS tweaks you **CANNOT CHANGE**;

**DirectionalLightmaps=True** (BRUTAL performance increase, but will cause almost every object in your game to be black)

**SHSecondaryLighting=True** (you lose too much lighting with this)

**DepthOfField=True** (must to be set to true, or else you'll get screen freeze-ups and possible crashes, must be on)

**AmbientOcclusion=True** (same as above, but even more so, you'll probably end up crashing all over the place and the game will not be playable)

People have been noticing that you can't change to certain resolutions, so if you want a custom resolution in the same .ini file look for; **ResX=** and **ResY=** and change them respectively. Eg. ResX=1024 and ResY=768.

Well, thats all I got so far, hope it helped someone in someway. I know the game is pretty easy to play FPS wise, but there are some people who still struggle and want to play it, maybe these will help a bit huh? I don't have XCom because I can't afford it (college kills wallets), but I use my friend's account when hes not playing and this helped me out a bit.

Happy alien killing!

First off:  Don't attempt to do this one on Classic/Impossible. Definitely try this one on Normal/Easy.


This achievement requires you to have a soldier ""survive"" every mission during an entire play through.  Unfortunately the wording of the achievement is a little vague - this soldier also needs to ATTEND every mission on an entire play through. Which means that they can't be wounded and spend time in the infirmary.


What worked for me, and what I recommend for getting this achievement:


Following the first mission of the game you'll probably have one of your soldiers earn the Sniper class. Take this soldier on every mission in the game but never move them from the position that the squad starts in. 


Make sure to give this soldier the Squad Sight perk. 


With just this perk alone this Sniper will be one of your first Colonels and won't run the risk of being wounded by aliens since they'll stay at the starting area for the remainder of the game leaving you to complete all of your missions using 3-5 soldiers.


It may be limiting, but it's guaranteed to work.

This was pretty late in the game and I was just working on picking up some extra tech and training up my psi squad for the final mission. I've never taken on a battleship before so I really had no idea what to expect inside. It didn't help that my relay told me there wouldn't even be any sectopods.

----------------

So the team lands on the ship and takes up positions. They're a solid group of veteran psi soldiers with a couple of newer medics along for the ride. Our team cleared the first several rooms easily, their experience clearly showing. Stepping over the charred remains of a berserker, most of the team take up positions by the next door. They'd expected more of a fight from such a large ship, but they weren't complaining. Erin, our CQC specialist moves towards the other door hoping to take the enemy offguard as James gives the all clear from his crow's nest position behind the team.

Shane breaches the door to reveal another 2 squads of mutons, but Klaus is ready with his heavy plasma and drops 2 of the aliens before they know what hit them. The rest of the team focuses fire on the berserker and are relieved to see the body come skidding to a halt just meters away.

Erin, eager to join the fight bursts through the other door, only to come face to face with a massive metal frame and bright red eyes. She barely had time to activate her cloak before the creature had armed itself. ""Backup, I need backup NOW!"" She whispered into her radio as a heavy floater jetted through the door, presumably trying to spot her for the big guns.

James covered the team with his sniper as they rushed over to support their comrade. The moment they were out in the open however, mortar fire came raining down like death on the team. Mike and Klaus seemed to be alright, but both the medics had taken some serious damage. Shane was coughing up blood and Hoda could barely stand. They weren't going to be much help to anyone in this state.

Erin clutched her shotgun to her chest and took a deep breath. ""Klaus, get your team out of there. You too Mike. I'll cover you."" They weren't going to make it out of there without her help and she knew it. As the footsteps of her team, her friends, faded away she turned the corner and charged. It was quick work conquering one of those flying beast's mind, and he was all too happy to divebomb the mechanical monster. His rifle barely scratched its armor by the time the red beam was charged. The floater didn't stand a chance, but in such close quarters, the explosion caught his brethren's fuel line and he too went spiraling out of the skies. That was all the time Erin needed. Her cloak faded away as she leaped onto the sectopod, shotgun in hand. She didn't expect to make it out of that hallway, but several explosions later, she rose from the molten scrapyard of a room. She was gonna have to run if she still wanted a ride home.

----------------

Seeing a soldier single-handedly take down a squad of heavy floaters and a sectopod without taking a scratch simply amazed me. I wanted to keep going after that, but with 0 medkits left, a battered team, and who knows what else left to face I couldn't take the risk. I just hope seeing her team home safe was enough of a reward for Col. Erin.

My first playthrough ended after a couple of months since I had no idea what I was doing and neglected satellites, ending up with no money and half the council leaving.

I started again on iron man and have been doing really well, my marines have been walking through battlefields as if gods of war and I only lost a couple of rookies to cryssalids, until the first ethereal mission.

It started out great - first group were heavy floaters, easy. Second group Muton Elites, totally new to me but I took one out and stunned the other without even taking a hit. I then preceded to slowly move through the crashed UFO until I was sure there was nothing left but the central room. Couldn't be too hard, right?

Holy shit, opening that door was like flinging open the gates of hell. Sectopod, 2 repair drones, 2 elite mutons and of course the ethereal. Things went to hell in the first turn, one man mind controlled and gunned another down, sectopod vaporised my S.H.I.V, and my men were on the run from the get-go (had a heavy panicing and shooting at the others - she ended up getting shot by a mind controlled assault), in the end I prevailed with 1 man down but stabilised, another down and quickly bleeding out with no medikits left and one lone survivor (who is nicknamed Mr Miyagi, what a bad ass).

I thought this game was a reasonable challenge but the ethereals are insane. It just ate and returned about the first 6 shots I made at it and managed to kill 2 of my men via mind control. All survivors wounded, and that squad was my 5 colonels to boot.

In my team I got 2 psi-operators and 1 assault colonel with VERY low will AND Alloy Cannon.
At the first steps of a crash-mission, I manage to take control of a floater and to send it scouting aroud for hostiles alone under the snipers control.

Well, long story short, an Elite Muton kills my Floater (which was miles from the rest of the group) at its first move. My stupid colonel decide to panic and to use it's Alloy Cannon on my nearly perfect Heavy Major Psi Operative killing her.

I had to stop playing to calm down because I can't believe that this idiot could get so affected of a mind controlled unit getting killed. I can understand the mindcontroller getting panicked but him???

I think I will dismiss this idiot if I won't let the aliens kill him during this mission.

I start off in America, because the extra money helps.  As my build has gotten more efficient, I've come to believe it can be done in other starting nations.  
When you start off, only select your research.  Don't build anything in engineering.  Scan until the first abduction.  Every time I've tested it, this has occurred by day 6.  Choose engineers.  After the mission, the price of satellites will be $77 instead of 100.  Build 2 satellites and a workshop.  Research Arc-Throwers (after that, research weapon fragments).  Scan forward to the first alien UFO.  This usually occurs before day 16.  On this mission, do your best to not destroy too much of the UFO.  After the mission, sell everything you need to buy a Satellite Uplink.  You don't need any computer/ufo equipment for a LONG time.  There will be other UFOs and more Insectoid bodies - sell as needed.  Try not to sell elerium, alloys, or weapon fragments.  If you have spare money start excavating your base in preparation for your alien containment and power plant x 2.  You may even be able to buy your first power plant immediately.  If so, do it asap.  After your first escort mission, use your money infusion to build the alien containment facility, finish excavating the first floor, and buy a 2nd power supply.  These all complete by about the end of the first month.  When the first month ends:  
You will have 3 satellites in orbit and the containment center finished.  On your 2nd UFO mission capture both the crystal man and an insectoid.  Since you've been neglecting research, it will be vital to get the boost to beam-research asap.  
The first thing I normally build in month 2 is: Access Shaft and Officer School.  
I'm usually ready to assault the base before month 2 ends.  At this point, I have a 6 man squad with mostly laser weapons, and 5 satellites in the air.  As long as your base assault goes well, I can't see how you could reasonably lose any countries from this point.

Last night I decided to boot up Xcom for the first time in a while and start an Impossible Ironman playthrough.  I'd recently dominated Classic so I figured this wouldn't be so bad.

Alright, landing on mission 1.  Toronto, Canada.    I start with my 4 rookies in a parking lot facing a building thats right half is a warehouse, left is an office (for those interested in which map this was).  

Rookie A steps forward behind a car.  Sectoids spotted! Well that was quick...  2 run off into the building and 1 hides behind a different car.  I run Rookies B and C to the truck close to the building and Rookie D up with A.  Only A and D fire. They score a miss and 3 dmg respectively.  

Deadeye McSectoid snipes Rookie A.  Rookie D loses his shit and panics.  He then proceeds to fire upon Rookie B.  He criticals Rookie B, B dies.  C, watching this unfold doesn't tolerate death well and panics too. He proceeds to avenge B by shooting Rookie D.  You guessed it, it killed him. 

Technical Triple kill for Deadeye McSectoid.

Rookie C stands alone on turn 2, panicked. Another Sectoid, obviously jealous of his comrade's ability to slaughter the whole enemy team with one well placed plasma shot, runs in to make sure he doesn't get the 4th.  Leroy Sectoid runs in for the final kill on a cowering Rookie C.  

That's right. My play through lasted so little time, that the 2 Sectoids had earned more reputation/recognition than my entire Xcom team.   ",,False,self,t5_2si6x,False,,Chryssalid,True,t3_1ii5p3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/1ii5p3/a_very_short_ii_story_for_you_all_enjoy/,
1373493151.0,36,self.Xcom,1i1cut,How I learned to stop worrying and love SHIVs,48,12,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/1i1cut/how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love_shivs/,"After the SHIVCOM video was posted here, I decided to give SHIVS one last try.  I have to say, they don't suck as much as I used to think.  Some thoughts:

**Early game - Basic SHIV:**  This would be good if we could afford the cost.  But we can't, so don't bother.

**Mid game - Alloy/Laser SHIV:**  Now this is more like it.  18 hitpoints is a lot at this stage of the game, and SHIVs are hardened so critical hits are not a problem.  I start using these after I've done the alien base mission.  An alloy SHIV is really nice to have on a UFO mission, because it makes sectoid commanders look very silly.  It's completely immune to their psionic tricks, so all they can do is get (non-critical) shots on it with their pistols.  It's also handy on council missions for a similar reason - it forces thin men to use an attack which is capable of missing, and it can take at least 2 light plasma hits without dying.

**Late game - Hover/Plasma SHIV:**  This is still useful, but different tactics are needed to make it work.  18 hitpoints is no longer a big number, so unbuffed SHIVs aren't so great as defensive tanks any more.  But they do have some advantages.  The really big one is an accuracy of 95!  This is better than anything except a colonel sniper.  And it gets better: A hover SHIV can easily get an elevation bonus by lifting into the air, or a big fat range bonus by getting right in an alien's face.  I used them to keep my human soldiers alive.  There are many ways it can help with this.  

When attacking a UFO control room, I move the SHIV right up to the ethereal and shoot it at point-blank range.  That softens it up a bit.  If I don't kill the ethereal on the turn I spot it then it could blast the tank, killing it, but I'd rather lose the tank than lose a human.

Against anything else, it's just good to have a SHIV in the air.  A flying SHIV has 40 defence and can't be grenaded.  If it can flank, it can quite easily kill a muton elite or heavy floater in one shot.  If it can't kill, it can always suppress.  Any defensive buff makes it very hard to hit.  Aliens really hate the flying SHIV and will spend many actions trying to kill it.  

**General notes** 

SHIVS can rescue civilians and disarm bombs.   Unfortunately, they can't open doors in a civilized manner. (clearly, door handles are more complicated than alien technology).

SHIVs can be repaired by hacked drones.  In my last playthrough, I hacked a grand total of two drones, and one of them actually got to repair a damaged SHIV.  So this is pretty marginal, but it's something.

SHIVs are fast, don't need to end turn in cover, have a big gun, have very good accuracy, and are ultimately expendable.  This makes them ideal flankers.  I try to let humans get the kills, but if they all miss, a hover SHIV can reliably finish the job.

1. **Soldier class**. This should be a one-time, permanent decision that you make when hiring a rookie, instead of being randomly assigned after their first mission.
2. **Soldier gender**. It makes no sense that I can magically change a soldier's race, but not their gender. If I want a squad of hot supermodels, I shouldn't have to keep hiring soldiers until I accumulate enough women to make it happen.
3. **Soldier nationality**. Yeah, I'm all for diversity, but screw it: I want to see the Canadian flag on the uniform of all my hot supermodel soldiers.

Once the save game format has been reverse engineered, all of the above should be fairly trivial for a modder to implement, but it strikes me as odd that these aren't available as customizable options out of the box.

---

Now, the hard ones:

1. **Soldier voices**. Why does everyone speak with an American accent? Hire some voice actors and put them to work! Or better yet, if a modder could figure out how to inject arbitrary sound clips, we could record our own voices for the various soldier exclamations and responses.
2. **Squad move order**. The game seems to default to the highest ranking officer moving first at the start of each turn. My highest ranking officer (currently) is my sniper, so I want to save her move for the *end* of each turn. It's a bit annoying to have to tab to a different soldier at the start of every... single... round. When I'm getting ready for a mission, let me load soldiers into the dropship in the order that I want them to move each turn, or at least let me specify order by soldier class, like my assault guys always move first, support guys next, then any heavy guys, then any snipers, regardless of rank.
3. **Soldier inventory management**. Let me give up a pistol in exchange for an extra grenade. Or give up the pistol and the grenade in exchange for an extra rocket. Give me more options than just one two-handed weapon, one one-handed weapon, and one ""special"" item - that's annoyingly limited.

We've found quite a few of the ini files locked away within the .exe, which means Firaxis have made it deliberately hard to modify the game.

This is most likely because the multiplayer component was an afterthought for them, and it's client-side rather than server-side. This  means if you modify your game to make it easier/harder for you it will make multiplayer easier/harder/cheat-worthy for you. It seems as though modding was hidden away within the EXE as a cheat prevention for multiplayer which, if true, is very, very disappointing in a PC game.

Anyway, as well as opening up some INI files for editing (see: http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/802574-finding-the-first-step/), Nexus user PepprMintButler has found a way to enable most of the seemingly hidden away ""Second Wave"" options (see: http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/803941-activating-second-wave/page__pid__6434595#entry6434595) that are meant to become available after you complete your first playthrough of the game.

Here is what I mean, players organize their units into squad setups and same with equipment. This brings in a element of the old game how you would have to distribute equipment among the different soldiers at different bases. Plus it resolves at least some of the equiping issues since the equipment belong to a teams pool.

Now this brings in a whole new element, morale, similar to willpower but unlike will power, it is not a permanent stat. Instead it is on a changing postive/negative scale. The main stat it most affects is willpower, postive morale can boost be added to your willpower, while negative can take a person under their willpower.

Morale also has bonus effects and is a double edged sword, a squad that has been together for a long time will become far more lethal, they can get overwatch bonuses depending on how many you have on overwatch, if one team member is suppressed increase odds of another team member hitting the target that is suppressing them and other effects.

Wouldn't it be interesting if we could develop new equipment based on unexplored items from the game?

Researching **Alien Food** could give us hints of what the aliens can and cannot ingest, thus enabling us to develop the absent classic **Stun Bomb Laucher**. It could have a toxin that weakens organic alien life forms, or knock them unconcious with some neurotoxin. If it were an Area of Effect Weapon,  we could have our version of the Thin Men's Poison Cloud or something, using it with our Heavy Class soldiers. Maybe the Stun Bomb would work only on specific aliens, with the poison-resistan Thin Men and the superdrugged Beserker being immune to it.

**Alien Entertainment** could help us understand their culture or how they react to some imagens and sounds, and researching it could enable a new Foundry project for Psionic Class units  that enhances Mindfray attacks, giving it the equivalent of a Critical bonus (dealing up to 2 extra damage).

**Alien Surgery** could help us understand more about alien fisiology and, more importantly, their weakspots – even more so than their autopsy; this could lead to a new Foundry project that trains our soldiers to identify and target them, giving them all **bonus Critical chances**.

It could enable yet another Foundry project to upgrade our medical facilities with some of their technology, considerably **reducing our wounded soldiers healing period** – which should be extra helpful if Second Wave's Marathon is enabled!

Once the aliens had finished moving into cover, my Heavy Major Astrid 'Dozer' Fournier lets loose a rocket straight into the room. With the 'Danger Zone' ability, it destroys all cover in the corridor and reduces all but the Berserkers and 1 Muton at the back to just 2HP. Then my other heavy unleashes his rocket, right between the 2 berserkers. Even without danger zone, it's enough to kill all but 1 of the already hurt Mutons, turning [this](http://imgur.com/D1WP7)... into [this](http://i.imgur.com/FyhfX.jpg).

The tide turned, Captain Adrien Timmermans finishes off the other wounded Muton, another Assault and Support manage to kill one Berserker, and my Colonel Support wounds the final Berserker.

I'm not playing on Ironman due to the bugs, but I play in the style of Ironman for the most part(Guilty of scum saving a few times.)

I get really attached to my characters, I usually name some after friends and build story lines around them.  One of my friends whom I'll call Ice, is a hotshot sniper who was actually very good early on.  He hit all of his shots and was quickly promoted and easily became my strongest unit.  He went on every mission, and had the highest kill count.  Yeti(another one of my friends), a German heavy was a hero.  On the graveyard mission, two of my soldiers were on the lowground hunkered down when 2 floaters, 3 thinmen and 3 sectoids teleported on their location.  I like to envision that the enemies were actually underground and rose from the graves.  With one rocket, Yeti took out a majority of the enemies and saved the squad from a sticky situation.  Yeti would continue to save the squad in future missions with his trusty rockets.

However, Yeti's heroism was short lived.  While he was hunkered down behind a car, a team of muttons fired on his position.  The car blew up, and while Yeti did not die from the explosion, he died from enemy fire.  Colonel Ice, witnessed one of his best friends die, but the death didn't end there.  He would witness another best friend Captain Samurai(me), being ripped to shreds by a cyrsalid.  He would witness his friend turn into a zombie and attack his fellow squadmates.  Having the best shot he would end his best friends suffering by shooting him in the head.  Our cocky sniper would quickly turn into a hardened and cynical veteran.  

After telling my friends these stories they were quickly interested and decided to check it out.  The plan was to head to my place for an hour and I would show them Xcom, then we would hit up a club.  The plan changed after they REALLY got into watching xcom and seeing the story of the soldiers unfold.  We spent the entire night playing Xcom.  We cheered and hugged each other when we saved a loved soldier from bleeding out by finishing a mission the turn before they died.  We were all tense after a team of rookies were almost massacred by a berserker while my stronger units were being tested for ""The Gift"".  With their superior officer unconscious, the two remaining heavies finished the job.

Afterwards my friends told me that they were going to get Xcom:EU.  This game has given me such a fun experience.",,False,self,t5_2si6x,False,,,True,t3_147v02,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/147v02/my_xcomeu_experience/,

I thought ""no problem"", and took them out per usual. The area was not my favorite, being a gas station full of explosive cars and pumps. But it would have to do. As I was moving a guy around I found 2 sectoids. Again, no problem. I just about cleared out the mutons when one of my guys panicked and took out the gas pump near my heavy, who was pretty heavily wounded. He was in critical condition, but I had my medic so I didn't worry too much. While my medic was en route, three more mutons came out of the building. At this point I was getting a little worried, wondering how I would pull through this. My support got gunned down, but my two snipers both took out a muton each so my hopes were high. I got another string of lucky hits taking out a muton and two sectoids, but three MORE mutons jumped down from the roof. They instantly took out my assault and one of my snipers with a grenade, and went for my final two squad members. At this point it was just a low level support and my top sniper. I tried booking it back to the skyranger, but my support was gunned down on the way. My sniper, alone and with about 5 health, made it to the skyranger and was evacuated.

Here is the link to my imgur. http://imgur.com/a/g3CBG

Some of the photos described how a cleared the final room. But I will elaborate here.

By the time I got to the final room, I had a medic with 1 health pack left, I still had the two smoke grenades. One medic had the wide radius grenade, the other with the +will +crit. I still had all my rockets, one heavy had 1 shredder 2 rockets w/increased dmg, the other 1 shredder 1 rocket. 

So I had my medic that had no packs left run out (more like inch out till saw the aliens.) Still had movement left so that I could retreat, before retreating though, had my sniper shoot the ethereal on the back platform, managed to land two crits. Then I had my medic run as much as she could back to the door. 

Alien movement. 

I have my medic run back to the spotting point, could only see one ethereal but since it was in the lower area my sniper couldn't see. She still had movement so made her run back to where she came from. Alien movement, ethereal shoots my medic, she can still be revived. My turn I pop the smoke, (+will +crit) to cover sniper, heavy and it reached up to just the doorway (friendly side.) Put my guys on overwatch. 

Alien movement.

My turn have my medic revive the other medic which then spots the two aliens in the screenshot. Sniper has no shot. Have the heavy without the dmg increase to rockets shoot a shredder rocket at the round thing in the middle, then the heavy with the dmg increase shoots same spot, then i have my psychic run up the hallway to cast rift. To my surprise, i had killed the aliens in that one go. 

I can say that one thing that did help out early game was that in my previous attempts of trying to beat impossible ironman, I noticed that when you hired new recruits they started off with more health than the initial troops. So for this play-through, the very first thing I did was hire 4 guys.

Also, after beating the game on regular, i skipped right over classic. I figured if I was going to do Ironman, it would be on Impossible or not at all. I guess you get the classic achievement when beating it on impossible. Now if only I could beat superhuman on the original...

With the slew of new video out there, I'll try to keep putting these out but I would encourage any subscriber to pick a subject, do some research (aka going through the videos, taking screenshots and reviewing) and compile the information on their subject, then post it in /r/xcom for us all to review, comment and add to.

Today, I've chosen one of the key game mechanics that has emerged as an important decision that players make in XCOM:EU - Satellite Deployment.

Satellite Deployment seems to be the way of steadily increasing your council funding from countries in both $Credits and Staff (Scientists and Engineers) but also looks to allow you to capture the bonuses from other countries - making that starting base location decision a little easier to swallow.

**Satellite Deployment**

One satellite can be deployed per country listed on the continent.

* Africa: 3
* Asia: 4
* Europe: 4
* North America: 3
* South America: 2

Total Satellites Needed for full coverage: 16

Each Sattelite Requires 5 Engineers and $77 to build (unsure if NA bonus was applied). For 16 Satellites, that is 80 engineers and $1232.

Each Satellite Uplink Requires 5 Power, 10 Engineers, $150 and at least 8 Days (?) to build and at least 5 travel days to deploy (this could possibly be adjusted off base location vs. deployment location).

That puts each Satellite at a cost of (calculating in the Satellite Uplink costs):
* 2.5 Power
* 7.5 Engineers
* $152
* 13 Days

The total cost to have complete Satellite coverage, a total of 80 Power, 240 Engineers, $2432

Countries, in order of credits paid per month for coverage:

* USA: +$180/month
* Russia: +$150/month
* Canada: +$100/month
* China: +$100/month
* Germany: +$100/month
* Japan: +$100/month
* Nigeria: +$100/month
* United Kingdom: +$100/month
* Brazil: +$80/month
* France: +$80/month
* South Africa: +$80/month
* Argentina: +$70/month
* Egypt: +$70/month
* Australia: +$60/month
* India: +$60/month
* Mexico: +$50/month

If a player focused on the critical path for building Satellites only, and did not face resource constraints - based on not fully confirmed numbers and unknowns such as if difficulty level affects costs, it would take a total of 208 days to construct and deploy them or by July on a 2015 calendar. Implementing with credit income as the critical path, the deployment would look like this:

* Janury - $330, 2 Scientists
* February - $530, 2 Scientists, 2 Engineers
* March - $730, 3 Scientists, 3 Engineers
* April - $1010, 5 Scientists, 4 Engineers
* May - $1170, 7 Scientists, 4 Engineers, Bonus: Expert Knowledge
* June - $1310, 7 Scientists, 6 Engineers, Bonuses: We Have Ways, All In
* July - $1480, 8 Scientists, 8 Engineers, Bonus: Future Combat


It would be interesting to see analysis based on the benefits allowed from taking an income, scientist or engineer focus on income but the choices between satellite deployment balanced against mission rewards seem to suggest that this is a meaningful choice for the player's game style.

Another interesting analysis would be the critical paths for getting continent bonuses and their value in time versus their cost savings.

Each continent breaks down by the following:

**Africa**

* 1: +1 Engineer Per Month
* 2: +1 Scientist, +1 Engineer Per Month
* 3: +1 Scientist, +2 Engineers Per Month
* Bonus: All in

* Egypt: +$70/month

* 2: +2 Engineers Per Month
* 3: +3 Engineers Per Month
* 4: +4 Engineers Per Month
* Bonus: Future Combat

* Australia: +$60/month
* China: +$100/month

Sorry if this is a repost of what everyone else knows all too well already, but I bought the game 4 weeks ago and only managed to get a few hours in before an enforced hiatus. Back on it most of this weekend and, well... ITZ is a lifesaver. 

I was doing the Alien Base mission and it started badly: triggered two sets of Mutons + Berserker, and stupidly got two rookies pinned down ahead of the rest of the squad. They were one-shotted by what looked like pretty lucky hits from distance but hey, that's the game, right? As I moved my Assault LT up to start the fightback, another Berserker popped out of nowhere and critted him for another instakill. 

Things are going... badly. 

What followed was a cagy back and forward with a heavy Sgt, Support LT and my matchless Col Sniper. Long story short, a 20-min guerilla war ended with the last big ugly dead. 

I'm thinking that's got to have broken the back of it, so up we move, cautious as cautious can be. Looks like the final room up ahead, I do the tester move with the support just inside the doorway and my heart sinks. 6 Heavy Floaters and 3 drones ping out of nowhere. I pull everyone back, get the Col nicely set up, I'm looking at the neat little killzone I've created... then the bastards start coming over the top. I didn't even realise it was possible... assumed that if this was a base, this should be a closed room. Well, guess what. 

I'm gritting my teeth as they all move in. I've got 3 HFs in the killzone room, the other 3 seemingly above it, and the drones scattered among them. I sigh thinking ok, let's see how this pans out (I'm not on Ironman, so at the very least I can go back to the start of the level). 

Well, I go to my Col Sniper and I've got 6 targets. He can see 5 of the Floaters and a Drone, and then I realise that they're all out of cover. They're charging, trying to swamp us. 

You've already guessed how this ends. 6 kills, one after another, with his plasma sniper. His turn ends, there's one Floater left, my support takes it down with a plasma rifle, and my heavy manages a drone. 

After that, reader, the level was mine. 

TL:DR thought it was all over, swarmed by a fistful of Heavy Floaters, and my In the Zone sniper killed the lot in one turn.  ",,False,self,t5_2si6x,False,,,True,t3_1320so,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/1320so/in_the_zone/,

1) Choose Europe to start so building a workshop will be easier for future satellites.  
2) Research ""Weapon Fragments"".  
3) First mission choose the engineers reward.  
4) After completing mission build a satellite.  
5) Build two scopes when weapon fragments research finishes.

7) Launch satellite over the US to get largest income boost.  
8) Transfer interceptor to North America.

I'm working on a few things to change up in /r/xcom and I would like to open a few for discussion and feedback. I'd also like to get any suggestions from you while we're at it.

Ideas in the works:

* **Overhaul of /r/xcom**
We've been working on a /r/xcom a facelift. We're going to get some art, hopefully some additional flair and possibly a new snoo (reddit alien). This art *may* be provided by 2K. We'll see how that works out.

* **Changes to rules/FAQs**
Currently the only rule being enforced by the Moderators is to have the discussion in /r/xcom focused on XCOM and not be used as an advertising forum for other games. We're going to get a statement up in the sidebar about this.

All content otherwise is accepted but we expect to see a slight rise in traffic and posts with the release of XCOM:UE. If you'd like to ensure that /r/xcom stays away from certain posts, now is your time to speak up.

* **Sidebar Changes**
The side bar over there ---&gt;, we plan on making a few updates. Redirecting some links and archiving some things. Since discussion and traffic will soon be focused on XCOM:UE, we're going to take some steps to clean it up a bit and consolidate some of the information. We'll also be adding /r/xcom Player and Game Profiles.

* **/r/xcom Player Profiles**
One of the initiatives for /r/xcom subscribers is going to be to setup your own ""Rookie"" profile. In your profile, you would list your country, nickname, class and set it up for other player's to use in their games.
 
This keeps your partners/wives/husbands/fiances, family members, girlfriends/boyfriends, friends and pets safe from harm and also provides some fun posts for /r/xcom to share with each other. I can't wait to see a Classic Ironman Let's Play made with only members of /r/xcom. Hopefully Limiate goes out in a blaze of glory in your game.

This could very well expand into our own ""Memorial Wall"" based on the memorial wall in the bar in the barracks. We'll see where it goes.

I'm currently trying to find a way to implement this. Currently we're thinking an additional subreddit or a single thread. If you know of another subreddit that does something like this or have an idea, please PM me.

**

In a German forest last night a Ukrainian soldier paid the ultimate toll for the successful X-COM mission code-named Silent Gaze in which an enemy commander was captured from a downed UFO. 

Rk. Tatyana Solovyova was on her first mission with X-COM after several high ranking elite personnel were ruled unavailable due to Psionic Testing and doctor's orders. She had been elevated ahead of more senior personnel on the recommendation by her fellow Ukranian; Col. Tatyana ""Shotsy"" Novikova (Au). 

After approaching the downed stricken enemy craft the squad led by Col. ""Snake Eyes"" Guo (Sn) and consisting of Col. ""Mr Clean"" Klein (Su), Col. ""Buster"" Haddad (Hv), Col. ""Shotsy"" Novikova (Au) and Cpt. ""Lockdown"" Liang (Sn) along with Solovyova.

The 2 Ukrainians took point supported by Haddad and Klein with Guo and Liang the sniper team acting as fire support. Intel had indicated strong enemy resistance as they enemy craft seemed largely intact despite the heavy impact it took from the crash. 

Initial enemy resistance consisted of a trio of Heavy Floaters. Combat was initiated by sniper support and with consummate ease and a path cleared to the vessel. Upon gaining eyes on the vessel it was deathly quiet, battle scanners were used in case there was an ambush. Upon gaining a foothold in the vessel, faint alien communication was heard, and a pair of Muton Elites were encountered. 

As the firefight ensued in the interior of the vessel against an entrenched and unfamiliar opponent Col. Guo ordered the forward teams to withdraw to the exterior so that sniper support could provide fire Col. Klein remained undetected inside to provide intel on enemy movements which proved invaluable.

The Elites pressed forward into the waiting sights of Guo and Liang, and faced a withering hail of accurate fire from sniper support and several rockets from Haddad. Novikova and Solovyova provided flanking fire. After the engagement one of the Elites lay dead and the other was badly wounded. Klein who did not participate in the action was able to subdue the wounded muton with the arc thrower, unfortunately not before the wounded Elite had made contact with his allies and requested immediate reinforcement.

Reacting to this call was another new threat, a huge bipedal robot emerged from the bowels of the ship accompanied by 2 escorting drones. Since Klein was not at a safe distance, Haddad was unable to use explosives, however as he had HEAT ammunition this was not too much of an impedance. It still took the combined efforts of the entire squad to take down what X-COM scientists have now dubbed the ""Sectopod"". The drones were then easily dispatched. 

After checking of the interior with battlescanners before proceeding, the squad moved towards the bridge in the centre of the ship which was largely undamaged and where a single enemy communique was detected. Before breaching; Guo, Liang, Haddad were to provide covering for the entry team of Klein, Novikova and Solovyova. 

Expecting to see a single unprepared enemy in disarray they breached to find a well prepared elevated defensive position of 2 Muton Elites guarding the Alien Commander. The Elites had turned the tables on X-COM, facing such unfavourable conditions, any potential breach would be foolhardy in the extreme, an alternative was needed and fast. 

Haddad fired his one remaining missile at the well ensconced position but due to the blast radius and the enclosed interior of the ship, it was too effective and a large proportion of the surrounding wall was destroyed exposing man and alien in the open.

Liang and Guo did not need a second invitation and opened fire at the Elites, wounding one and killing the other. Klein was charged with capturing the enemy commander and was not in a position to give supporting fire to his squadmates. Novikova instantly relocated to a flanking position on the enemy commander after the wall collapsed and Solovyova flanked the remaining Elite. Both of their fire was accurate but both of their targets were too resilent to succumb to the plasma fire.

Now it was the Aliens turn to exact revenge. The last remaining Elite ignored the nearer danger posed to it and attacked a distant Liang who had counted for many of his kinsmen. The heavy plasma round struck him squarely in the chest, burning through the carapace and badly burning him before he was able to throw off the molten metal vest, barely alive he was no longer in the fight. 

The Alien commander (now code-named Ethereal) then unleashed it's shocking powers on it's assailant Col. Novikova who despite being clad in the resilient titan armour layered with chitin plating, offered no protection to the Ethereal's irresistible mind. A horrible wale was all emanated from Novikova's position and her life signs indicator went down. 

Haddad finished off the gravely wounded Elite and fired upon the Ethereal but somehow he missed, perhaps it was the Ethereal's will unknowingly forcing his hand, he had also expended his clip and had to reload. Whilst this was happening Klein had the terrible conundrum of whether to help Liang for he was the only soldier competent enough to deal with such severe plasma burns or capture the enemy commander at all costs. He chose the mission but this indecisiveness would weigh heavily on him.

By now Guo had joined Solovyova and closed in on the Ethereal forgoing cover, hitting it with plasma pistol fire to little appreciable effect. It was if as though it was drawing energy from somewhere else, that well became apparent when the Novikova entered the room running fast, she was alive but something was not right with her. Rather than fire upon the slender robed figure she fired upon her own squad mates hitting Guo in the flank. 

Realising that the only way of halting the mind controlled Novikova was killing or capturing the Ethereal, the squad had a choice to make whether to put themselves or the mission first. It was here where Solovyova made that call. Knowing that she had little hope in besting Novikova she proffered herself up to her countrywoman who took what seemed like an eternity to pull the trigger and kill her. Seeing this the Ethereal let out a derisory call which only fueled the remaining soldiers to redouble their efforts.

Haddad and Guo fired upon it, the fine robes jumping away from it's body; it's veneer of calmness slipped for a moment as the plasma and laser hit home. It was almost recovered when a sprinting Klein came bursting in to the room, he had bided his time waiting for a moment of weakness to show to play his hand. The Ethereal roared at the approaching figure and growing realisation of what was to come. 

In Klein's hand the arc thrower shot out an irridescant blue ball at the Ethereal, the air which moments before had been thick with plasma and laser fire now was burned anew. The blue flames nearly engulfing them both such was the proximity to one another. When the air finally cleared and only one was standing; Klein was breathing heavily above looking at patterns in the singed robes as the Ethereal spasmed erratically below him. 

Novikova collapsed to her knees released from the mind control and wept above Solovyova's body, tortured in her own mind to forever relive her deeds. ",,False,self,t5_2si6x,False,,,True,t3_171a6z,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/171a6z/the_final_acts_of_tatyana_solovyova/,

1352420804.0,29,self.Xcom,12vxg9,The Reveal: A retrospective on the Gameinformer cover story that first got me fired up for XCOM: Enemy Unknown,30,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/12vxg9/the_reveal_a_retrospective_on_the_gameinformer/,"So, I was leafing through some old magazines today and happened upon the Gameinformer from February 2012. The cover story was XCOM and the magazine contained such features as a preview of Mass Effect 3, the Top Games of 2011 List, a rundown of the 2011 VGA's, including a bit about The Last of Us, and reviews of such games as Final Fantasy XIII-2 and Resident Evil Revelations.

The centerpiece, however, was the cover story, a piece covering Firaxis's remake of XCOM. As I read the article, there were some gameplay elements that were either changed or didn't make the cut. I'll list some of the changes below:

* More than one UFO on radar at once. - Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've never seen this happen before
* Africa consisted of ""cash-poor nations that contribute a smaller amount to XCOM's overall funding - but the continental bonus is a motherload of raw resources that can provide XCOM's engineers with everything they need to keep the organization's armories stocked"" -That's literally exact opposite of Africa in the game today. It also suggests that there were more resources than just spacebucks
* Jake Solomon says, ""You could never, in two playthroughs, see the same map [twice]"" - Maybe, maybe not. I've certainly seen some of them more than once in a single playthrough, although the variety is supposedly there
* Regarding SHIVs: ""Several different chassis types become available throughout the course of the game"" - There's the base SHIV, Alloy SHIV, and Hover SHIV, so that checks out
* Grenades were REALLY different: ""At the end of the alien turn the XCOM grenade explodes"" - That would have been IMO, really bad. I like how grenades work now. They're great early, but weak later.
* Another big change: ""since he bought it courtesy of a particularly destructive weapon, his equipment is so badly damaged that it can't be salvaged"" - Wow. That would be significant if weapons and armor could be destroyed on death. I don't know how I feel about that.
* Not a change, but a Solomon quote: ""Panic is one of those things I just couldn't part with. It creates those fantastic moments in combat."" Followed by ""We've tried to make it the sort of thing that won't catastrophically end combat for you"" - Well. That is different from my chain panics of death and rage from poisoned rookies. Personally, I think panic could use a little less friendly fire and a little more undisciplined moving.
* On PC and console ports: ""And fear not, PC players - Firaxis is planning to take advantage of the platform's unique capabilities to provide an enhanced interface"" - I guess not. Although the interface works well enough for me.
* Difficulty levels: ""Finally, if you're an XCOM devotee from the old days, take comfort in the fact that the hardest difficulty is simply called Classic mode - Obviously not hard enough.
* Experience was different: ""Losing a squadmate, while entirely understandable given the brutal combat situation they were thrust into, disqualifies the rest of the soldiers from an experience bonus"" - I'm really glad they changed this. It would suck if this bit were still in the game.
* Potential end game: ""It seems likely that the endgame will involve some kind of invasion of XCOM's secret base...but Firaxis stopped short of confirming that despite dropping strong hints"" - Having never played the original XCOM (don't judge me), base defense sounded awesome. That being said, the UI at the base would have had to be reworked significantly to allow for such a mechanic. 
* Other miscellany: The combat UI is much different and more noticeable, I prefer the current menus. Same for the research menus.

In February of 2012, this article convinced me XCOM was going to be awesome. Having played through several times, my expectations blown away. There are bugs that do need fixing, but overall, XCOM has been a great game.

TL;DR - See what did and did not make it into the game from a February alpha build. There's some cool stuff...and some not so cool stuff.",,False,self,t5_2si6x,False,,XCOMEUMajor,True,t3_12vxg9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/12vxg9/the_reveal_a_retrospective_on_the_gameinformer/,

Please try it and give some feedback so we can make it work perfectly.",34,6,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/1203cf/ive_polished_the_second_wave_mod_both_for_all_and/,"I've seen some of you have had the same ""problems"" with XCOM as I have. So I got the Second Wave mod and started playing with the ini files. So far I've modded them into three different mods. One for Marathon and everything but Diminishing Returns and possibly Results Driven on classic+ (Marathon), one for when you want Diminishing Returns and possibly Results Driven active on classic+ (Second Wave), and one for Vanilla classic Marathon (Vanilla classic).

For Second Wave to be active you have to have completed the game or at least find someone's savegame for that.

I've made classic+ a lot harder. It's a merge between classic and impossible marked with (classic+) under tactical, everything else is also in Vanilla classic. I haven't edited easy, normal, or impossible (they should still be playable but I haven't tested it yet). These are the changes:

Tactical gameplay:

• Aliens have as much hp as on impossible (classic+).

• Aliens have classic aim (thin men down 5 aim), crit, and a very slightly lower ability useage than impossible (classic+).

• Slightly more will on ranking up.

• ~150 % xp needed to level up.

• Chryssalid kills have 75 % chance of zombies outside of vision, up from 50 % (classic+).

Strategical gameplay:

• Continentel bonuses tweaked so they're equal (research times on autopsys and interrogations are lowered making South America not completly needed to have a chance).

• Panic levels are tweaked to be more in tone with Marathon.

• Cost of items, buildings, research, officer training, and foundry upgrades tweaked to be in tone with marathon.

I would be very happy to get any and all kinds of feedback so we can tone this to be as perfect as possible.

[And here's the link to the nexusmods](http://xcom.nexusmods.com/mods/40).

Credit to PressureCereal for making me take my time to write this down.

Edit: Added installation guide.

To install the mod all you need to do is extract the .rar anywhere you want and run the modpatcher.exe of the mod you want to install ([each folder is a different mod] you can't have more than one installed since they edit the XComGame.exe), if you want to try an other mod, simply run the associated modpatcher.exe. The patcher will make a backup of the original XComGame.exe and call it xcom-original.exe (won't be overwritten if you patch an other mod) which can be found at ..\Steam\steamapps\common\XCom-Enemy-Unknown\Binaries\Win32. If you want to diable all mods, simply delete the XComGame.exe and rename xcom-original.exe to XComGame.exe.

Installing a mod will change any saved games. But if you go back to the original .exe it will be as before. So all that's needed is to swap the two .exe if you want a game with the mod and a game without.

Edit2: v1.01 is out. Found a ""bug"" in the ini files - the continent bonuses are registered inversed. And balanced a few items worth.

The continent bonuses are as following:

• Asia: 40 % discount on OTS and Foundry - it will say 60 % when you choose base location.

• Europe: 60 % discount on Labs and Workshops - it will say 40 % when you choose base location.

• Africa: 20 % higher total income (already worked).

• North America: 70 % discount on interceptors and their equipment - it will say 30 % when you choose base location.

• South America: Instant autopsy and interrogation (already worked).

In my most recent Classic game I focused on getting continental bonuses, rather than using satellites to calm down panicking countries.

I fully expected to lose a few countries, but was willing to sacrifice some of the endgame funding for better bonuses when the game is much harder. But by hitting the Base in April panic was never an issue and I completed the game without losing a single country.

So I'm starting to wonder if launching the maximum (an uplink every month starting in April) amount of satellites is really that important. 

Particularly in April, when instead of building an uplink and 3 sats I could get a foundry and OTS which would help a lot for the base assault. The assault totally solves panic for that month and gives enough money to add the missed uplink and 3 sats to next month's budget.

I'm going to go try this with an Asia start, which is usually a bonus I'm not interested in until at least month 3.",,False,self,t5_2si6x,False,,,True,t3_1e0174,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/1e0174/do_you_really_need_to_put_out_3_satellites_every/,

* Fix stability issues
* Add hotkey to hide/show ceilings (rather than letting the camera decide as I'm moving it around)
* Hotkey to ""Overwatch All"" on missions (excepting, of course, snipers who might have used up one action)
* Workshop and Laboratory screens should show not just whether I have the required cash &amp; materials, but how much I have on hand, total (I might not choose to build or research something if I'm low on Elerium or such)
* A setting to minimize non-essential cutscenes (Skyranger taking off, alien aggro, researching alien, facility coming online, etc). I'd even settle for this being a perk of completing the game once.
* Would like to see my squad represented on each soldier's HUD, similar to how alien heads show for LoS; show me who's alive, who's dead, who's MC'ed, who's panicked, who has movement left, who has used up their movement -- all with iconic representations that I can mouse over to see individual names, and let me click on to select that soldier

1350350118.0,29,self.Xcom,11jmb2,[SPOILERS] An Open Letter to the People of Earth,39,10,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/11jmb2/spoilers_an_open_letter_to_the_people_of_earth/,"###There is a good chance no one will ever read this.
 I have been told that this letter, as well as the events described within it, will be declassified only when ""the Alien threat has been sufficiently defused."" Knowing what I know, that the Earth is far safer than it was even before this whole mess began, I suspect that that requirement will never officially be met. In the rarest of cases, one in which the Council eventually develops a collective conscience, and the events that have taken place over the past year are allowed into the public view, I feel that it is necessary to provide my perspective on, and justifications for, the events that have transpired since I assumed command of the XCOM Project. 

If a Council censor is reading this, I urge you to remember the sacrifices the citizens of this Earth have made in our fight against the Alien threat; do they not deserve our transparency? I already know your response, of course. Consider this my letter of resignation. I hope you can find someone more... determined than I am, for the sake of us all.

###You may not know who I am.
I am ResistTheUrge, Commander of Operations for the XCOM Project, and I have been working with the bravest and most talented souls the world has to offer for [the past year](http://i.imgur.com/cKxGu.jpg) in order to combat what has come to be known as the ""Grey Menace."" You have seen our jets and experimental aircraft in the skies. You have heard reports of our elite operatives engaged in conflicts around the globe. You saw the destruction of the Alien Temple Ship as its debris rained down upon the earth, a hellfire testament to XCOM's effectiveness, forged in blood and grit. Now, as the Earth rebuilds, you have our actions to thank for your continued survival.

I say this not to inspire awe or terror, but to underline the sheer, unrelenting effort supplied by the men and women under my command. 

###A trusted aide is worth a thousand servants.
If the Aliens had had such a resilient and determined director of operations as [Central Officer Bradford](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102773486), we would have lost this war. When I could afford it, I slept at night knowing he was at work in Mission Control, ready to make the tough decisions when it came to unidentified contacts. Ready to sound the alarms at any time, Bradford was able to push through defeats as easily as victories. I would not have anyone else by my side in this crisis. He was not only a brilliant ally, but a trusted friend. If the Council has any sense, they'll appoint him commander following my absence, and if he has any, he'll decline.

###The darkness of war breeds progress and ingenuity.
This has never been clearer to me than after witnessing the combined strengths of our research and engineering teams. Even though it's been a year since they began their work, I feel like I met the project leads just [the other day](http://i.imgur.com/i5XnK.jpg).

[Dr. Vahlen](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102773435), a prime example if there ever was of German ingenuity, led 159 brilliant scientists beyond the veil of human knowledge to an understanding of the universe few have ever dreamt of. Psionics, the Elerium power source, cybernetic implants, hyperwave technology; the list goes on and on. Each and every single member of the research team deserves a Nobel Prize, but today, they go home in obscurity, gold watches and government pensions in hand. They are forbidden, under pain of death, to reveal the secrets they've uncovered in their time at XCOM. What a terrible fate that must be, to have such knowledge, only to bury it. Perhaps that is the ultimate lesson taught at XCOM.

Down in the workshops, [Dr. Shen](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102773388) kept his staff of 218 engineers busy, trying to keep up in an impossible arms race with the Aliens. I'll be damned if they didn't succeed, though, and every soldier under my command has him to thank for their lives. Brilliant developments in weapons and armor technology have launched the human war machine hundreds, if not thousands, of years beyond what it was previously capable of. New aerospace platforms, communications systems, and life support matrices promise a new frontier as we colonize other planets.  Advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, and energy management have rendered obsolete the problems plaguing industry and economy the world over. We, as a species, are primed to enter a golden age, and for that, we have the tireless engineers of XCOM to thank.

###The actions of a few have resonated among many.
Faced with this crisis, the survival and prosperity of the human race ultimately depended on the drive, bravery, and ferocity of only [six men and women](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102750172), the very best this world has to offer. In addition to engaging the enemy all over the world in a bid for the safety of its citizens, these powerful warriors stood tall against the might of the Alien Temple Ship, prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for all of mankind. 

###[Colonel Amelie 'Dice' Leroy, Deceased](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102749842). Missions: 41. Confirmed Kills: 82.
Col. Leroy made a name for herself in the very first official XCOM mission, alongside Col. Delgado and Col. Rahman. Unlike her squadmates, she refused to believe the Aliens were a threat until their blood was splattered all around her. Always the first into the AO, she had little regard for her own safety, often drawing fire away from the other members of her team. She fell to a cunning trap laid by the Ethereals aboard the Alien Temple Ship, but, knowing her, she's smiling down at us for making the bastards pay.
###[Colonel Ernesto 'Arcade' Delgado.](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102750038) Missions: 39. Confirmed Kills: 53.
Col. Delgado is no man to trifle with. He earned his nickname the first time we came into contact with those damn cyberdisks. After eating a grenade and watching one of his rookie squadmates fall into critical condition, Col. Delgado lost it, charging the enemy and taking it down in one volley. His efforts in defeating the sectopod guards on the Alien Temple Ship werekey to our victory. Without him, I have no doubt the world would have ended, right then and there. I hear that he's doing security work in Portugal, now. I hope they know how safe they really are.
###[Colonel Maria 'Missionary' Petrova, Deceased.](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102750228) Missions: 28. Confirmed Kills: 37.
Col. Petrova was a Lieutenant in the Russian Special Forces before she was transferred under my command. Despite her chosen role of support gunner, she had little interest in the back lines. Her preferred position was at the enemy's flank, bursting from the shroud of her smoke grenades, all fire and fury. I was hard on her, tried to make her work together with the squad. Hell, I even benched her, sent her to the psi labs for some time off, so she could cool her heels. Boy, did that ever backfire in the most spectacular of ways. She was the first Psionic member of the human race, and she took to it like no other. She was the first to volunteer for psionic experiments in the Gollup Chamber, and she gave her life to save the planet by maneuvering the Alien Temple ship out of the atmosphere, only moments before it exploded. I sit here now forever thankful and honored to have had her grace my command. She was a fine soldier, and she will be missed.
###[Colonel Aya 'Baroness' Rahman.](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102749986) Missions: 42. Confirmed Kills: 85.
Col. Rahman was our foremost designated marksman at XCOM, although her technique was different from most. Rather than a silent guardian angel at the back of the battlefield, she found vantage points deep within enemy lines. With a quick trigger finger, she often dispatched twice or three times as many threats as an average soldier might be able to do in the same amount of time, and rarely did her aim fail. I may have commanded Col. Rahman, but the Baroness held dominion over the battlefield.
###[Lieutenant Mamadou 'Fast Lane' Digkale.](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102749915) Missions: 4. Confirmed Kills: 7.
Lt. Digkale did not see much combat during his tenure at XCOM, but following success in the psionics program, he was quickly integrated into our core team. Showing an aptitude for squad management and defensive tactics, he quickly established himself as a foundation for the assault team. He was an invaluable asset as a final line of defense against the Ethereal's psionic attacks. I'm proud to send him home a hero to his native Nigeria, where I hear he has started a school for psionically gifted youngsters. 
###[Colonel Christine 'Shotsy' Fischer.](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102750103) Missions: 34.^[12] Confirmed Kills: 75.
Col. Fischer joined my team after being discharged from the German military for psychological reasons. Personally, I believe they simply didn't have as effective of an outlet for her aggression as the Alien operatives she faced at XCOM. That's not to say she didn't have issues; she broke a fellow German applicant's jaw after he called her 'Schatzi' in basic training. The nickname stuck, quickly adapted to her propensity for CQB tactics, and that little incident was one of CO Bradford's justifications for putting her in an assault position in our squad. 

###A new dawn approaches.
I grow tired remembering the countless operations our organisation has taken part in. Dear citizen of Earth, know that I would gladly go through this whole nightmare again, if it meant that we could maintain the peace and prosperity we have worked so hard to achieve. I hope you would do the same.

Ok, I started this game playing classic difficulty (no ironman). I rushed getting beam weapons and carapace armor, but neglected getting extensive satellite coverage. This haunts me throughout the game.

Throughout the game, I lose a lot of soldiers. Like, about 1 or 2 a mission. I keep going, and end up progressing up the tech tree where they gain a good measure of survivability. I attack the alien base the second I find it, not knowing it will reduce global panic and it's a one time only deal. I use it when panic is relatively calm. Again, my satellite coverage isn't great and I've lost around 3 nations.

Once I get to the part of the game where I need to shoot down the oracle ship, I realize that my interceptor fleet is woefully lacking. As I scramble to get them up to date, I start losing council nations. I lose **seven** of them. At one point I have two countries with full terror bars and a council report in several days, and I assume that my game is over.

Thankfully, neither of the countries leave. A few missions later, and I get the terror levels under control as I shoot down the oracle ship. I rush getting the Gollop Chamber built and send my best soldiers into the Temple Ship. Many dead aliens and a rapid fire Alloy Cannon shot later, and I beat the game!

This was seriously one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. I could have sworn to you that I had lost that game, and was already planning what my next game would do to prevent my early mistakes. I decided to play it out, so I could see the ""failure"" movie and own my mistakes, but thanks to some luck and well executed missions, I pulled out the victory.

I know a lot of people have had their complaints about this game, and they all have valid points, but seriously, this was the best game I've played in years. Thank you, Firaxis.

I was completely ignorant of any of the series history and I didn't see so much as a single review for this game. I was completely, 100% in the dark on how this would work.

So I get through the tutorial mission and the cutscene where you talk to the one guy happens. During this scene I realize that *I* am the general. I'll never be shown because I am me. Then he tells me to go to the barracks to promote some guy and the camera starts to zoom out.

""Oh I must be backing up or something"".

*Camera continues to zoom*

""Why do I keep walking backwards""

*Camera zooms through a rail*

""Did I just walk through that rail""

*Camera zooms all the way out to see the entire complex*

OK, so here is where I started laughing. Because I had just gotten into the mindset that *I* am the commander and with it zooming out like it did I now feel that I'm playing a giant who looks into the tiny rooms where people are doing things. I don't know why, but this absolutely amused me to no end.

So there I am in a fit of giggles, and I decide to go and promote my soldier. I click on the barracks and place my giant head up to the barracks and look for the guy I need to promote. But instead of promoting him I noticed another option. Customize? So I took this guy and poked him until he became black, and then I gave him giant green hair with pink armor. Oh, and I changed his voice too. Then I change his name. Why? Because fuck you tiny human.

I was laughing my ass off. Here I am, some kind of underground giant running a secret government facility and my poor troop gets word that he's going to get a promotion. Next thing you know I push him down and completely change everything about him.

I get what is actually going on, but it was just such a surreal sequence of events that it really amused me.

Being out in the open has the same penalties as being Flanked. There are absolutely no differences between the two. Being Flanked from an enemy effectively means you are out in the open *to that enemy*. This of course means that you can be flanked, and still receive cover bonuses from enemies that are not flanking you.

Whether you are flanked or out in the open, the only penalty you receive is a +50% critical chance against you. It is *not* inherently easier for enemies to hit you, nor does flanking an enemy make it inherently easier to hit them (it just takes away cover bonuses). 

2. Want to research Blaster Bombs but haven't found an alien Battleship yet? Ignoring UFO contacts towards the late game will typically bring a Battleship contact that will attempt to destroy your satellite. Bradford will actually tell you something along the lines of ""we're picking up a strange signal, almost like they're searching for something"" which signals that said UFO is looking to shoot your stuff down. Of course, this does not work all the time, but if you're tired of doing each and every Small Scout missions, just let a few fly by and hopefully you will attract a Battleship. This even works on Impossible and you will *not* gain too much panic, provided this is late game.

3. If possible, begin shooting with rear troops *then* shoot with troops that are closer to the enemy. Your own troops have the potential to blow up cover that is occupied by a friendly, and if this happens *after* you have already performed the 2 actions of said friendly, it is almost guaranteed that he will die because his cover is now gone.

4. On Classic or Impossible, it is extremely difficult to skip laser weapons without serious consequences. Even if you rush straight to Containment *and* have S. America bonus, you are almost always going to run into Mutons before you finish Light Plasma research. I've tried this several times, and would not recommend this course.

The opening mission and the first panic mission are currently being uploaded + processed and should be viewable soon.

They feature live commentary and no post because I don't have the time and patience. They're at 720p/60fps but I have no idea if YouTube will retain the 60fps. My microphone is rather quiet, but the sound should be balanced accordingly. After listening to me everything else will break your eardrums so remember to turn your volume back down when you're done.

Episode 1 features a standard first mission.

Episode 2 features the first panic mission wherein I manage to aggro every single sectoid on the map at once and resolve the situation without resorting to explosives. A small amount of luck was present and there were a few hair-raising moments but hopefully I explained my reasoning and mindset behind my actions taken.

[Edit] Episode 3 features the first UFO shootout and crashed UFO mission. It's incredibly easy and I once again showcase the power of flank + overwatch and the power of hunker down to manipulate the AI.

[Edit2] Episodes 4 and 5 are up. I take a LOT of damage in episode 4 and lose my main assault. Episode 5 is the first Slingshot DLC mission and it sees me taking on a sectoid, many thin men and a muton with only ballistic weaponry. Under normal circumstances I would skip this mission ENTIRELY until later on in the game - But I guess you guys didn't come here to see me do that. I WILL NOT be doing the second slingshot mission for a long time though. It's just too hard on Impossible without full laser or plasma weaponry.

I beat the game on Normal Ironman a long time ago, had fun, but didn't feel challenged enough. Then came about a dozen attempts at Classic Ironman, all failures (I refuse to save-scum except to get around game-breaking glitches).

What I really wanted was something that gave me the fully realized AI and challenge of Classic, but without some of the numerical boosts that make it such a huge jump up from normal. Why couldn't there be a level of difficulty in-between the two options?

Enter the Second Wave. Not Created Equal randomizes starting Will and Aim for your recruits, making it possible to cherry-pick the ones with the best stats. You still have to work to keep the good ones alive, and you have to spend money to recruit enough to weed out the redshirts. Overall, it adds a tiny bit of extra management and strategy to the game, while making Classic just that little bit easier to handle.

The effects of a few extra points of Will and Aim should not be underestimated, though. XCOM is very subject to cascade failures - one missed shot leads to one extra alien returning fire, which leads to one more panicked soldier, which leads to less firepower during your next turn, which may lead to a death, and so on. But if you didn't miss that shot, or the soldier didn't panic, a team wipe could be a victorious mission instead.

The second-to-last enemy did get off a shot, however, causing two damage.

Not normally a problem, except that three of my soldiers panicked.  One shot and killed a squadmate, while two were in cover behind a now burning car, which exploded and killed them the next turn.

The next mission, another three panicked after a thin man got off a shot- one killed the escortee, while two ran to exposed partial cover and were instantly flanked and killed.

Fell back, dispatched six of them, got complacent, stacked three units behind a car WITH smoke popped, thin man scores a lucky hit on my squad leader (not in the smoke, was going for a flank on the right side) for 4 damage; doesn't kill, but wounds.

My turn, 5 panicked and my assault needs to reload.  Meh.

Aliens turn, car blows up and kills all three behind it, one thin man takes out my flanked, and the other suppresses my assault while the third moves to a nearby position ready to flank with overwatch.

Here's mine from continuing my normal ironman w/ tutorial to start (XCOM rookie here).

My first encounter with Chrysalids: Mission is on an interior map, place isn't very open, lots of twists and turns and doors. Have 5 units, four ranked up to Lt, two snipers, a heavy and an assault, and a Squaddie Support. Everyone is still using regular guns except the Support has a laser rifle and the snipers have laser pistols. Heavy is down to 1 hp after taking a hit to the face by one of the first group of Chrysalids at the start of the mission. Squaddie Support is down to 4 hp but has used his medpack. Everyone else is doing alright but I'm having trouble using the snipers effectively indoors.

Anyway, about 3/4 cleared the map, approach a new room and aggro a group of 3 chrysalids. Whoopsies: they're within striking distance of my Support and my Assault, both go down. My snipers and heavy then proceed to finish off the chrysalids but when the zombies rise and get within range of my men it seems to signal 2 other packs of Chrysalids (is this a real thing?). Know at this moment I'm doomed. Finished off the zombie, kill 2 chrysalid but then one of my snipers go down and my heavy gets cornered, literally with 3 chrysalid adjacent to him but not able to attack that turn. I think about it for a second and know its time to suicide rocket the pack. The rocket kills the heavy, kills a chrysalid and blows up a nearby object bringing the 2 remaining chrysalid down to 1 hp. Remaining sniper tries to distance himself and then takes a shot with his pistol and kills the second last chrysalid. Unfortunately he didnt get far enough away from the other one and it trots up and impales his ass.

Lessons learned from my first wipe:
 
* You don't have to do every mission right away (could tell it was going to be a hard one from the start)
* Bullets vs Chrysalids = fail
* Bring more grenades (all my guys had scopes except the support with his medkit). 
* [When it starts to fall apart, man it really falls apart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pBLeGYrYC8)

Instantly decided it was time to get serious and restarted on Classic Ironman mode, lost 1 guy and had the other 3 injured on each of my first 3 missions. Loving it so far.

1366868005.0,24,self.Xcom,1d2edc,I finally beat the game on Ironman Classic on my 40th attempt! This is what I learned.,31,7,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/1d2edc/i_finally_beat_the_game_on_ironman_classic_on_my/,"I've spent the last few months attempting to beat the game on Ironman Classic with a few Second Wave options enabled (Damage Roulette, New Economy, Not Created Equally and Hidden Potential). I have the Slingshot DLC, but I didn't opt for those missions in the game.




My first 20 or so attempts, I didn't get past the first two months in the game, mostly because I sucked (didn't stay behind full cover, didn't use overwatch enough, didn't plan properly etc.). The next 10 tries I usually got to month 3 then flamed out due to a combination of game-breaking bugs (especially teleporting aliens), mistakes, and just plain back luck. The last 10 tries failed almost entirely because of game-breaking bugs and bad luck.




I finally beat the game tonight on my 40th try! Here's what I learned:




**modern_quill's advice in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/11j7az/as_promised_ironman_impossible_strategy_discussion/) is just as helpful on Classic as Impossible.** 
Starting in South America and focusing on research credits made all the difference for me the last 5 tries. I did modify his plan slightly to include a sniper on my team, though, which proved invaluable to me in the final mission.




**Hover shivs (almost) balance out the game-breaking bugs.** Can't stress this enough. In the latter half of the game, I started bringing one on every mission, and would use them to blow away any enemy a soldier couldn't kill first. Their kill rate was about 95%. Wish I had started using them sooner, but I had stupidly dismissed them because I hadn't found the regular ground (alloy) shivs very useful.




**Ghost Armor is your friend.** Your best friend. At least if you're impatient and prone to making stupid errors occasionally that can only be salvaged with a well-timed ""See ya!""




**It's better not to assault the alien base until you've stockpiled resources, research and leveled-up solders.** This made the game take a lot longer, obviously, but I wasn't taking any chances this time. Plus it gave me more opportunities to experiment with different combat techniques. Others prefer to assault the base early, but with my luck, I was afraid to. :)




**I still fucking love this game.** Even though I cursed at the screen more times than I could count. And they really need to fix that teleporting alien bug!",,False,self,t5_2si6x,1366935285.0,,,True,t3_1d2edc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/1d2edc/i_finally_beat_the_game_on_ironman_classic_on_my/,

(The whole reason I thought of this was his stats having a bunch of 9's and 1's in it)

9/11, Never Forget. Only the truth was concealed under the orders of this man. It wasn't terrorists, it was aliens. George concealed this in an effort to prevent mass panic in the American population. The rage he felt at this attack continued to burn inside him and he began taking steps to ensure that another attack would not happen on his soil. 

Fast forward to February 14, 2006. This is the date of the infamous ""Dick Cheney (Vice president at the time) shooting another hunter"" incident. What the media didn't tell you was that on a routine hunting trip with his buddies George encountered his first alien face to face. A gang of sectoids had landed nearby in a small ufo and immediately began attacking the hunting party. Equipped only with quail hunting rifles the party was rallied on by George and they proceeded to fill the Sectoids full of lead. A careful government cover up then ensued, notice how an official statement was issued a full 2 days after the ""incident"". 

After retiring from the American political scene George used his connections to put him in contact with the Council Spokesperson who  pulled a few strings to get George into the training program. Despite his age he put up excellent rookie scores in Will and Aim and was drafted to fight in the war against the aliens. 

Now a Snapshot Sniper Colonel George is using his hunting skills to represent MURICA in the war on terror missions. Time will tell whether this American hero has what it takes to win the war!

Would be interested to know what memorable triumphs other people made when they were faced with a sudden 'Oh shit!' moment on a mission. When did you turn a crisis into a fistpumping victory? 


Background info: Third attempt at classic ironman. I always focus too much on satelites and not enough on other important things in base so I have carapace armor, but no lasers or plasma yet and only a 4man squad size. So far this is the best run I've had, zero casualties so far, just into the 3rd month.

Decided to get an acheivement I noticed, to do a mission with female squad members only, so I took out two of my best soldiers, Captain Pavlova (my only high ranked heavy who's been the linchpin of my main squad) and Lt Kojima (my only sniper in the whole game... got 5 supports though). Then I added my only female support, squaddie rank, and a female rookie and set off for a Large UFO crash site.


As I'm reaching the ship I've come across no enemies yet and I started to get the usual sound projections letting me know where things are and occasionally even a noise distinct enough to know what the enemy type is. Uh oh.. I know that particular noise...this map has crysallids, and I've brought a 4man team with 2 weaklings and tier 1 ballistic weapons. 


After taking out the energy guy in the first major room, and the 6 floaters who tried to flank me from behind, the only noise projections left are crysallid sounds coming from deeper inside the ship... somewhere. Took a lot of tense turns trying to move through the ship cautiously, using short moves, overwatching and battle scanners, setting everyone up in good positions before ever opening a screen door. I reach a large door and fully expect the crysallids to be inside what I know is a large long room with a ramp on the other side of the door. I set my heavy up on one side of the door, my rookie on the other side, my support way off down at the other end of the wall because a few steps around the corner is a balcony for a good vantage point next turn, and my sniper stood dead centre but away from the door for as much vision as possible to snipe next turn.


I'm expecting (or hoping) that when I open this door, a couple of crysallids will most likely scatter on their free move, either jumping to balconies or rushing towards my team. I can hopefully take both out in my turn with bullet swarm, headshot and a little damage from the other two. Hopefully they will still be far enough away in this long room that if I fail to finish them in one turn, they wont be able to reach my guys in their first move for a kill and have to dash to catch up. I open the door and holy shit there's 3 of them right inside the doorway. They all rush out on their free move and all stand adjacent to my Capt Heavy, ready to kill and implant her next turn. I had no idea what to do... with this squad and gear I don't think I have the damage to take them all out in 1 turn unless I manage to get solid crits from my sniper and heavy. I can't even move my sniper or heavy if I want to do as much damage as possible because I wouldn't be able to use the sniper rifle, and I wouldn't get to use bullet swarm. Maybe I can take two of them out but I'll still lose my best soldier on the enemy turn to the remaining one. I considered trying to run with my 2 high ranked soldiers and leave the others behind as fodder but those 2 left behind wouldn't be able to kill one of them without crits and I'd still be left with 3 crysallids anyways who will run down my fleeing troops with their superior moves per turn. What to do... what to do...? The answer came to me eventually, quite a simple answer infact that hadn't occured to me because I've never done anything like it before in Xcom.


Captain Ludmilla Pavlova, my only useful heavy, linchpin of my squad, hero of the hour.... took out her rocket launcher and shot it at her own feet, decimating the crysallids health down to 2 points each and punishing their stupidity in gathering so close around a single target. Our fresh faced rookie, inspired by the Captain, took out her single frag grenade and, with a thousand apologies, tossed it at the Captain's feet as well. Three dead crysallids, my Captain survived on 1hp, and the mission victory screen appears. Felt so good. Just to top it all off, fate perhaps, with my rookie's promotion she became a new heavy :D

I manage to successfully have a team of 14 evacuate the skyranger with only two deaths (damn rookie couldn't aim and a sectoid killed two people with autoshot) . I end my turn and WHAM, suddenly a stun bomb comes out from behind me and knocks out 7 of my soldiers. I send a rookie to charge down the sectoid with the small launcher thinking ""there is no way they will just pop another shot, he's to close."" And of course I am completely wrong on that one, bam suddenly I'm stuck with only 3 conscious agents and things are looking pretty awkward, I decide to have one guy stick around and hold vigil over everyone incase a sectoid decides to pop a grenade in or something. and I manage to do a swat style takedown of the UFO, unfourtunaltly there appeared to be one alien left alive somewhere on the map. and thus began a very comical run of taking a captain and a rookie on a run around to go find this hidden sectoid.

* Only injured is an assault out for 5 days
* All countries still present, two satellites up with three more coming this month.
* Two Laser Rifles built
* Thin Man, Floater, Sectoid Interrogations finished and 4(!) Light Plasma Rifles in storage. (1 Plasma Pistol as well)

~~Step 4A.) If enemies were found, watch the ensuing destruction take place due to overwatch, and then use your support to throw an upgraded smoke grenade down to cover yourself from the survivors, and or follow up enemies.~~

~~Step 4B.) if no enemies were found, repeat steps 1-3~~

~~Step 5.) If any of the enemies can deal aoe damage, aka grenades etc, scatter immediately on the following turn. And fire once a safe distance away.~~

x1 Shiv , useful for just about everything but high accuracy. Can one shot most weaker to medium strength enemies if driven up within 1-3 blocks(for higher accuracy).

I did some googling and apparently this is a side effect of the developers deciding that the old method of the aliens just patrolling or wandering around in the background was not feasible, and that it led to too many boring games and ""hunt for the last alien"" syndrome. So they implemented a spawning method where the aliens are actually teleporting around in the fog of war until the player ""happens"" to activate them. I can't get into the specifics of how this mechanic works, but the gist is... I think it's lame and leads to an artificial feel to the assault missions.

If finding the last alien in the closet is an issue with newer players (hell, even I was annoyed with that end game in the OG), isn't that easily solved with the built in sonar feature of the game? You can get a sense of the alien's position by ""hearing"" them, and the game even visually shows you which direction to go.

Overall:  A good remake of the original.  The little cutscenes were very nice and the game maintained a level of action throughout.  I did like the limitation to the squad at 6.  In the old game, at the later levels it could become very unwieldy to have a dozen troops plus a tank.  

Also, money.  Right up to the end I was having to balance need versus budget.  Which is as it should be.  Also, I loved the fact that my troops could see around them.  I can't tell you how many guys I lost in the old game because they were facing the wrong way.  

Downsides:  That really annoying problem with different elevations and how they are viewed.  The lack of flexibility in what a given troop could do was also annoying.  Also, the aliens.  Them getting a free move when you first see them ticked me off.  Plus, they didn't really seem to behave intelligently.  More like targets than foes.

I will say that I did enjoy the final scrap.  It came down to 1 guy getting in behind the boss alien with a shotgun.  KABOOM!  Welcome to Earth.

Approaching the UFO, have one sectoid left, and the outsider (who hasn't spawned yet).  Run and gun, kill the sectoid.

Outsider spawns, I figured my assault is dead, and am ready for him to get wasted.  Outsider obliges me.  My mistakes, got overaggressive.

I start moving up, hearing him move a bit.  First heavy moves up to the only full cover outside the UFO.  Shot dead by overwatch.  I'm a little irritated, but them is the breaks.  Maybe I shouldn't play so risky.

Two remaining troopers push up, one at that bit of cover, and the other in full cover on the outside of the UFO.

Outsider then proceeds to drop my rookie like third period algebra (he's bleeding out, have three turns to waste this idiot).  Ok.  Got a heavy left, he's still got his rocket.

Shoot the rocket, it fails.  I'm a little irate at this point.  And of course, to cap off 4/4 kills, the outsider shoots my heavy dead.

It was the 4th mission of my I/I campaign, with only one casualty so far, it was going quite well.

I had a heavy, an Assault, and due to some injuries, 2 rookies. (I think you can guess where this is going)

It was an abduction on the map that is often a bomb defusal scenario, the butchers shop with nearby meat storage warehouse.

Having been around the Xcom block a few times, I knew to expect a few sectoids in the nearby alleyway. I send my heavy, assault and rookie 1 into the butchers shop ready to breach the door into the alleyway. Meanwhile rookie 2 sits behind a car ready to trigger the Sectoids.

Next turn, Rookie 2 steps up to the corner, triggers a pack of 3 Sectoids, who unfortunately take good cover against the flank team.

So I back Rookie 2 back into the store, and wait until next turn, where hopefully the aliens will chase him into an easier position to flank.

The aliens had other ideas, instead an alien bursts through the breaching door, The heavy and assault miss their (point blank) reaction shots except Rookie 1, who does 2 damage.

So in strolls a Sectoid high on purple stuff, takes a look at Rookie 2, and down he goes. Rookie 1 panics, and takes a shot at the Assault, taking him to 1 health, who in turn loses it and blasts a hole in the Heavy, who also goes down.

With a 1 health Assault and Rookie 1 crying like little girls, Mr Purple and his friend finish off the most pathetic excuse Earth can call a response to alien hostility.

Oh well, that's I/I.

1)  Every move counts, and you never quite know what's going to ""kick the can"" and bring out more aliens.


2)  The sound track is completely killer, and not until I had played for several hours did I realize how important to the whole experience it was.  A LOT of games have tried to tie in sound with game play, but XCOM REALLY gets it right, to the point that I don't think most people are even conscious of it.  But like a good horror flick it really makes every nerve stand up on end.


3)  For the first couple of play troughs there's such a sense of the unknown, and you just don't know what's going to fix the problem, with the terror level in all the countries ratching up up up.  I've gotten a better handle on this after a while, but it's still unnerving.


4)  The ""pacing"" is really good, it really feels like a race against the clock.  The old game didn't seem as bad, particularly once you got a really large squad, it started to drag a bit.

I had a Chryssalid with less than three health, but he managed to eat another civilian (right?). He was standing on top of the dead civilian as he ended his turn. I threw the grenade, fragging the Chryssalid and the corps below it. the interesting thing was, it didn't rise as a zombie the next turn. 

I'm not sure if this was just a glitch or if this is a way to control zombie spawning in Xcom.  I know that if you use explosives on a corpse, e.g. if you stunned one alien or shot it, you get less loot. But does this also apply to zombie spawning?

I'm scouting him out on Graveyard, when my Heavy peeks around the mausoleum to see a Heavy and Plasma Sniper. His Sniper misses, then his Heavy hits with a Heavy Laser. I hear the guy laughing and yelling ""Yeah!  Yeah!  You better run, you better run!""

Then I pull out my rocket--did I mention his guys were bunched up?  I hear him screaming ""I'm screwed!  Oh!  Oh, I'm screwed!""  Both get knocked down six. 

I activate Run &amp; Gun, send my Assault shooting over to flank his sniper, and blast him in the face. One of my Smokejumpers--Tom Hanks--moves forward and finishes off his Heavy, and it's game over.

I've just finished the game on classic (not IM though) and have a question regarding the sniper class.

I've equipped my sniper wih grappel armor and had the DGG perk, but I found it impossible to use on almost all maps. What high ground is there that can be reliablygrappled onto\used?

On most maps I found that grappling onto rooftops either limits my vision (as most enemies will be inside the buildings) or leaves my guy with no cover - essentially a sitting duck. 

On forest missions, as I see it, there is no high places at all, save for roofs of some of the UFOs (which again feels useless as most aliens are inside).

I tried archaengel armor, but it sais in the description that flying does not grant the usual high ground bonuses. 

So.. What's up with that?",,False,self,t5_2si6x,False,,,True,t3_124cky,http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/124cky/damn_good_ground_is_it_worth_it/,
