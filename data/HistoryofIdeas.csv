I will come back with a post where I invite you to post your questions -- for now I just wanted to share the good news, and give you the opportunity to ponder a bit before you decide what to ask. The better the questions - the better the interview!

Until then -- here's a [**collection of previously posted**](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/search?q=skinner&amp;restrict_sr=on) links about Skinner, and a short presentation:

***
&gt; **Quentin Robert Duthie Skinner** (born 26 November 1940, Oldham, Lancashire) is the Barber Beaumont Professor of the Humanities at Queen Mary, University of London. 

&gt; Professor Skinner is the author or co-author of more than 20 books, and his scholarship has won him many awards, including the Wolfson History Prize (1979), the Balzan Prize (2006) and the Bielefelder Wissenschaftspreis (2008).  

&gt; He has been the recipient of honorary degrees from 12 leading Universities, including, Chicago, Harvard and Oxford.  He is a Fellow of the British Academy, the Royal Historical Society and the Academia Europea, and is a foreign member of the national academies of Austria, Ireland, Italy and the United states.  

&gt; His scholarship is available in 24 languages, and his [*Foundations of Modern Political Thought*](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_24?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=the+foundations+of+modern+political+thought&amp;sprefix=the+foundations+of+moder%2Cstripbooks%2C377) (2 vols., 1978) was named by the Times Literary Supplement in 1996 as one of the 100 most influential books published since the second world war.

&gt; **The 'Cambridge School'**

&gt; He is generally regarded as one of the two principal members of the influential 'Cambridge School' of the study of the history of political thought. The 'Cambridge School' is best known for its attention to the 'languages' of political thought and the contextual focus this gives its distinctive blend of intellectual history and the history of political thought. Skinner's particular contribution was to articulate a theory of interpretation which concentrated on recovering the 'speech acts' embedded in the 'illocutionary' statements of specific individuals in writing works of political theory (Machiavelli, Thomas More, and Thomas Hobbes have been continuing preoccupations). This work was based on Skinner's study of the philosophical preoccupations of J. L. Austin and the later Wittgenstein. 

&gt; One of the consequences of this account of interpretation is an emphasis on the necessity of studying less well-known political writers as a means of shedding light on the classic authors - although it also consciously questions the extent to which it is possible to distinguish 'classic' texts from the contexts, and particularly the arguments, in which they originally occurred and as such it is an attack on the uncritical assumption that political classics are monolithic and free-standing. In its earlier versions this added up to what many have seen as a persuasive critique on the approach of an older generation, particularly on that of Leo Strauss.

&gt; **Research interests:** Professor Skinner works on early-modern European intellectual history, with a particular interest in the rhetorical culture of the Renaissance and the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes.  He has also written about a number of philosophical questions, including the nature of interpretation and historical explanation, and about several issues in contemporary political theory, including the concept of political liberty and the character of the State.

Due to the piling up of things to do in my real life, I'm going to take a break from Reddit until mid-June. 

If you like this subreddit, and the bulk of the things posted here, I hope you will use this opportunity to help keeping up the flow of posts (and comments). Maybe even enter the [top ten submitters](http://stattit.com/r/historyofideas/) list!

So far, we've had no official guidelines for what can be posted, and I won't make any changes to that right before taking a break. It's been up to us mods to judge on a case-by-case basis, and it'll stay that way for the foreseeable future.

However, since I've posted the bulk of the posts here so far, I'll try to jot down something to explain what *I* consider r/HoI-material:

* Material about the history of ideas (surprisingly), defined roughly like in the sidebar. I'll repeat it here:

&gt; &gt; * the study of the history of ideas, including the histories of philosophy, of literature and the arts, of the natural and social sciences, of religion, and of political thought!


* That means it can be about

&gt; &gt; * one or more particular ideas/concepts or ways of thinking, thinkers, common conceptions, traditions, social or intellectual movements, at a *particular time* in history, or *throughout* history, or

&gt; &gt; * the relevance of any such mentioned above — *today*

* Articles (including PDFs), reviews, videos, podcasts, lectures, audiobooks (preferably signified by a [tag]) are welcome



* Explanatory post titles. The original title of the article isn't necessarily the best suited for posting to r/HoI. We're intellectual omnivores, but sometimes we have to be nudged a bit to learn new things... Also keep in mind that the Search function is only as good as the title posts are explanatory and to the point



* Many readers prefer to check the comments before clicking the link. If you think your link is worth posting, consider posting a comment about it as well. A [snippet from Wikipedia](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/1c7c6n/1896_william_james_delivers_an_address_titled_the/c9drs7a) helps the reader understand what your post is about, and whether it's worth reading 

* If you post a scholarly article, particularly if it's a PDF, please consider pasting the Abstract in the comments

* The convention I use for book titles when posting reviews is 'Title of the Book' (2013), by Awe Thursname. Sometimes the title even includes a ""quote from the article""

* For further guidance and inspiration, check the list of [top posts of all time](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all)

I suppose that is all. 

Best regards,

You now have the opportunity to teach us - the [r/HistoryofIdeas](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/) crowd - about your own area of interest! Political thought, religion, literature, art, science, philosophy - you name it! It could be on the historical development of a given idea, or on an idea or concept in a particular time period.

Now, you don't need to have a PhD in the subject. What we want is someone to take us through a series of weekly posts where you teach us something, and are open to questions from us, your students. The series could perhaps go on for 3 to 8 weeks?

How you want to do it, is up to you. It could consist of weekly self-posts with text, videos or podcasts, or anything else you deem proper (note that the amount of time needed to absorb the content of each post will probably affect how many of us who'll be able to follow it on a weekly basis). 

Like I said, you don't need to consider yourself *the* authority on the subject, but if you manage to make it interesting, I'm sure critical questions will abound, so be prepared to be disagreed with. Disagreement is just a starting point for a good discussion.

We're really only asking for someone to introduce us to something they are knowledgeable of - and be prepared to answer questions and engage in discussion! The top link in the sidebar will be reserved for a direct link to your project for as long as the project goes on. -------&gt;

this is a proposal consisting of two aspects:

1) I really like HoI and the interesting content that gets posted here (thanks /u/Qwill2 and others). However, I feel that there is a bigger 'latency' period between reading the texts and being able to discuss them. 

Most of the time, when I am through with reading an article, the respective thread is already several days old, so it is not really useful to try and discuss it there.

2) On the other hand, I feel like there are common themes among the new content that gets posted. It could be interesting to actually discuss these common topics in comparison instead of reviewing each and every post on its own. 


My suggestion therefore is:

Let's have something like 1 to 3 weekly threads for open discussion that focus on one or several of the articles that got posted within the last week(s). These discussions would not have to be strictly about one submission but could be about common themes from the submitted content of the recent past.


Right now, HoI is great for finding very interesting content but there is little discussion happening here. HoI_academy is set to private. I think that some kind of regularly, focused discussion could be a nice addition to this subreddit. 


I know that the easiest way to find out if there is demand for something like this is to simply start it and see what happens. This is true, but I wanted to get some feedback on the idea itself.

I, [srx_god](http://www.reddit.com/user/srx_god/) will be conducting a series of interactions on Hindu Mythology and Hinduism as a religion.

Hinduism is one of the world's oldest religions. Statistically, the third largest religion in the world after Christianity and Islam. The majority of the adherents of Hinduism can be found in the Indian Sub-continent.

These are simple facts about Hinduism as a world religion today.  However, there is a lot more to Hinduism than simply the fact that it originated in India and is one of the most widespread religions in the world.

Some interesting details about Hinduism:  

* It is more a philosophy than a religion.  Hinduism is a set of guidelines to lead a righteous and devout life.  
* Hinduism is not a conquest oriented religion.  There is no system of conversion. Any believers/followers are free to choose Hinduism as a way of life. They simply need to put into practice what Hinduism explains.
* Hinduism has a pantheon of Gods and Goddesses and the number is rumored to be 330 Million. Some count that.
* Hinduism lends it's name to India. The other names India is known by are **Bharat** after a legendary emperor of India and **Hindustan**, literally meaning *Land of the Hindus*.

Hindu Mythology is rich and varied. Going into the details, one can draw several parallels between Hindu Mythology and stories from other religions and/or regions.  Full of interesting stories and characters, Hindu Mythology also holds 2 masterful epics, The Mahabharata and The Ramayana.  The Sacred Text for all Hindus is the Bhagwad Gita which is a beautiful composition believed to be recited by Lord Krishna, one of the Avatars of Lord Vishnu to Prince Arjuna.

We will embark on a journey and discuss these characters, their lives, their deeds and the stories starting tomorrow.

We shall have 6 lectures as part of this series.  I will post my first lecture tomorrow and we shall continue discussions on the lecture for one week till the next lecture is online.  As and when the lectures are posted online, I shall update this post with the links to the respective lectures.

In order to account for reader interest, I will keep my course plan flexible.  Here is a brief of tomorrow's lecture. You can reply here with any topics that interest you/you would like covered and I will include those in my posts accordingly. I hope we have a great interaction and that I am able to do justice to this vast topic that I have chosen to represent. I look forward to sharing my knowledge with you and learning from you as well.  Thank you all for this opportunity.

(http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/130evn/hoi_course_hindu_religion_and_mythology_hindumyth/)  

And to start off, a Hindu Prayer:

*Guru Brahma Gurur Vishnu*  
*Guru Devo Maheshwaraha*  
*Guru Saakshat Para Brahma*  
*Tasmai Sree Gurave Namaha*  

**Translation:**  
*The [Guru](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru) is a representative of Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwara (Shiva).*  
 Meaning: he creates (Brahma is the Creator), he sustains (Vishnu is the all-sustainer) and destroys (Shiva, the Destroyer of Worlds).  
*The Guru is a representative of the Ultimate Divinity.*  
*Salutations to such a [Guru](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru).*

1. More clarity with the translation.  
2. Lesson 1/6 is now online. Please reply on the post with your comments.

Kierkegaard understood that, when faced with a choice in real life, no amount of knowledge can resolve the dilemma

[**Kierkegaard's world, part 3: The story of Abraham and Isaac**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/mar/29/kierkegaard-philosophy-abraham-isaac)   
Abraham believes that the God who commands him to do what is most terrible and painful is also the God who loves him

[**Kierkegaard's world, part 4: 'The essentially human is passion'**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/apr/05/kierkegaard-philosophy-passion)   
The human being is above all an erotic creature: a being who, conscious that she lacks something, reaches out beyond herself

[**Kierkegaard's world, part 5: The task of becoming a Christian**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/apr/12/kierkegaard-philosophy-christianity)   
Kierkegaard suggests that people who are Christians 'as a matter of course' are deceiving themselves

[**Kierkegaard's world, part 6: On learning to suffer**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/apr/19/kierkegaard-philosophy-christianity)   
Kierkegaard suggests that by courageously confronting suffering, a person can find great joy in life

[**Kierkegaard's world, part 7: Spiritlessness**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/apr/26/kierkegaard-philosophy-christianity)   
Not to recognise yourself as a spiritual being is the greatest danger and the greatest loss of all

[**Kierkegaard's world part 8: God and possibility**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/may/03/religion-philosophy-kierkegaard-possibility-god)   
For Kierkegaard God is the fact of possibility: what makes us free – but also gives rise to anxiety

1353113102.0,29,self.HistoryofIdeas,13buim,[HoI Course] The French Revolution - Teaser for upcoming course,30,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/13buim/hoi_course_the_french_revolution_teaser_for/,"The tremors of 1789 may have been dulled by a distance of over 200 years, but its impact still shakes the world.

(I promise to be less over-the-top with metaphor in the actual course)

The French Revolution was a series of events equal parts fascinating, terrible and tragic. Revolution, but the French Revolution in particular, is history condensed and sped up. Political and cultural changes which have taken decades to centuries in other places took their course in the six years from 1789 to 1795, and the aftershocks of those changes could be felt in French society and politics for almost a hundred years after the first Revolution died down.

My course will include a short analysis of the events which led up to the French Revolution, both short and long term, as well as the actual Revolution itself and its attempt to create a new society. In keeping with the theme of this subreddit, there will also be a particular focus on revolutionary ideas and movements and how they influenced the course of political, economic and social change.

The Revolution has also led to a huge and diverse range of academic analysis, which will also be covered in the course. This course will have 7 parts, covering the end of the *ancien regime* in France, to the immediate lead up to the Revolution from 1785 - 1789, to the course of the Revolution and its attempt to restructure society 1789 - 1795, as well as historiography of the Revolution and revolutionary ideas and movements.

Why study the French Revolution? Because it offers a significant insight into the nature of humanity. It encompasses all the extremes of political thought, and it illustrates the reactions of ordinary individuals in extraordinary times. It's highly relevant to the modern era - the political and social factors which advanced the Revolution can be seen today, because the Revolution is a story of humanity which transcends technology and the status quo. And in presenting this course to you, I hold on to the hope that someone, somewhere will learn a profound lesson from those extraordinary times.

Suggested format:

***
**Area of interest, study or expertise**

Standard texts:

* *Some Old Classic* by Johan von Elderly - Arguably the book which 'founded' the field. Flawed, but still cited. 

* *The Controversial article that Marks the Great Division of Scholarly Opinion* by Max Revision - This article was heavily criticised for its use of SomeOtherMethodology or SomePerspective, and scholars still debate whether this is a major breakthrough or just bogus. 

* *The Modern Standard* by Al Balance - Manages to present the different opinions on the history of the subject in a fair way. A bit short on interpretation, but as it includes a thorough walk-through of all the different concepts and perspectives, it remains the modern standard.

* *Another book which I haven't read but some say it's The New Standard* by Ann Noun Awethor - Brand new, but has been praised in the scholarly literature.

Suggested introductory texts:

* *My subject: A Short Introduction* by Les Entertaine - Very short, and possibly a bit dated. Still, this little book is known for its clear language and helpful figures and tables. Recommended for beginners!

* *Inctroduction to the study of this awesome field* by Newt Hawts - Heavy on the footnotes, and a slow read. Includes a well-rounded bibliography. Most widely used at University introduction courses, I think.

More specifically Nietzsche, Heidegger and Sartre [video]",33,7,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/rnsp7/human_all_too_human_3part_bbc_documentary_series/,"From YouTube:

&gt; Human, All Too Human is a three-part 1999 documentary television series produced by the BBC. It follows the lives of three prominent European philosophers: Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, and Jean-Paul Sartre. The theme of this documentary revolves heavily around the school of philosophical thought known as existentialism, although the term had not been coined at the time of Nietzsche's writing, and Heidegger declaimed the label. The documentary is named after the 1878 book written by Nietzsche, titled Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits.

&gt; Each episode runs at 60 minutes, for a total length of three hours.

&gt; The first episode is titled **[Beyond Good and Evil](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-184240591461103528)**, which is about Friedrich Nietzsche and his gradual shift from religion, to nihilism, and finally to insanity. His sister presented the National Socialists (Nazis) with heavily modified versions of Nietzsche's writings that were interpreted as a pro-Nazi agenda; to advance the superior race of the Übermensch, the ""superman"", the perfect Aryan.

&gt; **[Thinking the Unthinkable](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-858369328131624007)** is the next episode that centers around Martin Heidegger, who developed ideas from the writings and ideas of Nietzsche in an attempt to better understand individual human freedom. Before and after the reign of the Nazis in Germany, Heidegger spent much of his time living in solitude in the hill of Todtnauberg to allow himself to clear his mind and better focus on his own philosophy. Due to the fact that he joined the Nazis during World War II, his works were dismissed by his critics as Nazi propaganda.

&gt; The final episode in this series, **[The Road to Freedom](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-184240591461103528#docid=5997040150951355473)**, describes the life of the French philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre. This is when the term existentialism begins to enter the realm of philosophy. The documentary shows that Sartre believes it is up to each individual human being to give his or her own life a meaning and a purpose.

Here's some info from the [presentation post](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/105a5l/in_two_weeks_time_rhistoryofideas_that_means_you/):

&gt; **Quentin Robert Duthie Skinner** (born 26 November 1940, Oldham, Lancashire) is the Barber Beaumont Professor of the Humanities at Queen Mary, University of London.

&gt; Professor Skinner is the author or co-author of more than 20 books, and his scholarship has won him many awards, including the Wolfson History Prize (1979), the Balzan Prize (2006) and the Bielefelder Wissenschaftspreis (2008).

&gt; He has been the recipient of honorary degrees from 12 leading Universities, including, Chicago, Harvard and Oxford. He is a Fellow of the British Academy, the Royal Historical Society and the Academia Europea, and is a foreign member of the national academies of Austria, Ireland, Italy and the United states.

&gt; His scholarship is available in 24 languages, and his [*Foundations of Modern Political Thought*](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_24?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=the+foundations+of+modern+political+thought&amp;sprefix=the+foundations+of+moder%2Cstripbooks%2C377) (2 vols., 1978) was named by the Times Literary Supplement in 1996 as one of the 100 most influential books published since the second world war.

&gt; **The 'Cambridge School'**

&gt; He is generally regarded as one of the two principal members of the influential 'Cambridge School' of the study of the history of political thought. The 'Cambridge School' is best known for its attention to the 'languages' of political thought and the contextual focus this gives its distinctive blend of intellectual history and the history of political thought. Skinner's particular contribution was to articulate a theory of interpretation which concentrated on recovering the 'speech acts' embedded in the 'illocutionary' statements of specific individuals in writing works of political theory (Machiavelli, Thomas More, and Thomas Hobbes have been continuing preoccupations). This work was based on Skinner's study of the philosophical preoccupations of J. L. Austin and the later Wittgenstein.

&gt; One of the consequences of this account of interpretation is an emphasis on the necessity of studying less well-known political writers as a means of shedding light on the classic authors - although it also consciously questions the extent to which it is possible to distinguish 'classic' texts from the contexts, and particularly the arguments, in which they originally occurred and as such it is an attack on the uncritical assumption that political classics are monolithic and free-standing. In its earlier versions this added up to what many have seen as a persuasive critique on the approach of an older generation, particularly on that of Leo Strauss.

&gt; **Research interests:** Professor Skinner works on early-modern European intellectual history, with a particular interest in the rhetorical culture of the Renaissance and the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes. He has also written about a number of philosophical questions, including the nature of interpretation and historical explanation, and about several issues in contemporary political theory, including the concept of political liberty and the character of the State.

**What are *you* reading this summer?** (It doesn't have to be related to the history of ideas at all)

I'll start:

* M. Cary and H. H. Scullard, [*A History of Rome*](http://www.amazon.com/History-Rome-Down-Reign-Constantine/dp/0312383959). I picked this up again, after putting Roman history on a break this spring. A bit dry, but as I've also restarted my listening to [Mike Duncan's podcast](http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/the_history_of_rome/2007/07/index.html) to compensate, I'm all good.

* Ola Åmodt, *Roma – Legender &amp; merkverdigheter* (Rome - Legends and Oddities). A Norwegian book with stories and anecdotes related to places and monuments in Rome. I only bought it yesterday, but I think it'll serve me well in my planning a trip to Rome with my nephew (me being the ""guide"") this autumn. By the way, if you happen to have any good advice on where to *eat* and *sleep* in Rome, that'd be great... 

* Antonio Gramsci, *Politik og kultur*. A Danish collection of some of Gramsci's letters from prison. I've only read the introduction by the editor so far, and I'm wondering if it's worth reading in full... 

* Hans Jonas, [*The Imperative of Responsibility: In Search of an Ethics for the Technological Age*](http://www.amazon.com/Imperative-Responsibility-Search-Ethics-Technological/dp/0226405974/). This is a book I've been meaning to read for a long time. Jonas' point seems intuitively true, and having made his main point in the introduction and the first chapter, I really wonder whether the rest of the book can deliver anything either new or necessary for his thesis. It's from 1979, so possibly the subsequent wave of environmentalism have made most of his arguments common sense? Not that this has had enough of an effect on real policy and behaviour, though...

~~As I'm leaving for a 2-week holiday in a few days, I'm wondering which book to bring. It's either H. H. Scullard's [*From the Gracchi to Nero: A History of Rome 133 BC to AD 68*](http://www.amazon.com/Gracchi-Nero-History-Routledge-Classics/dp/0415584884/) for a beach- and luggage weight-friendly paperback Roman history read, Machiavelli's [*Discourses*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourses_on_Livy), or Erving Goffman's [*The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life). I'd be grateful for any advice...~~

Ended up bringing H. H. Scullard's [*From the Gracchi to Nero: A History of Rome 133 BC to AD 68*](http://www.amazon.com/Gracchi-Nero-History-Routledge-Classics/dp/0415584884/),  
Marcel Mauss' [*The Gift*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gift_%28book%29), and E. H. Gombrich's [*The Story of Art*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Story-Art-E-H-Gombrich/dp/0714832472/). :)

Qwill2 asked me to post it this time, to get some variety.

I'll start:

* I've recently started reading a copy of Milton Erikson's [*Young Man Luther,*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Man_Luther) which I picked up for a bargain at a used bookstore. It provides me an interesting collision of Reformation/Religious history, often paired with reference to Kierkegaard, with Erikson's brand of mid-20th century psychoanalysis. The two complement each other surprisingly well.

* I've also made it to midway through Milton's [*Paradise Lost,*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_lost) as part of a renewed quest to pursue an understanding of the English language; this quest also led me to taking all of my notes last semester in iambic pentameter.... (an exercise which has led me to appreciate just how adept Milton was.)

* That interest in the English language also led me to oddities like [William Barnes'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barnes) book [*An Outline of English Speechcraft,*](http://books.google.com/books/about/An_outline_of_English_speech_craft.html?id=6HoKAAAAIAAJ) a 19th Century attempt to create a form of English that draws primarily from Anglo-Saxon/Germanic roots, rather than Romance/Latin/Greek sources. It's bizarre, but strangely beautiful, and it goes well with the poems of [Gerard Manley Hopkins.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Manley_Hopkins)

* That's all led me to an interest in the High Modernist writers of the 20th century, so I've been reading the verse of [Ezra Pound,] and this summer, once I have a break from classes, I'm hoping to tackle Joyce's [*Ulysses.*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_%28novel%29)

1352490734.0,22,self.HistoryofIdeas,12xfw7,[The Concept of Religion] Teaser for upcoming course,25,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/12xfw7/the_concept_of_religion_teaser_for_upcoming_course/,"Religion is generally assumed to be a universal aspect of human experience found in all cultures. It is generally believed that as long as there have been human beings, there has been religion, individual atheist or non-believer not withstanding. This assumption permeates the modern academy. A significant number of psychologists, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists are today working to identify the mental or biological origins of “religious experiences.” They are not alone. The most influential philosophers (Kant, Heidegger, Russell, Rorty), sociologists (Durkheim, Weber, Bourdieu, Habermas) and anthropologists (Geertz, Lévi-Strauss, George Murdock) of the last two hundred years seem to have largely taken religion for granted as a universal aspect of human culture and experience.

More recently, however, a diverse array of scholars from Talal Asad and Jacques Derrida to Jonathan Z. Smith and Tomoko Masuzawa have called into question the very field of religious studies by demonstrating that “religion” is not a universal entity but a culturally specific category that took shape among Christian-influenced Euro-American intellectuals and missionaries.

In this reddit course, I will be offering a discussion of the history of the concept of “religion” and an investigation debates around its universality. In effect I’ll be discussing the construction of religion as a modern concept and discussing all that this entails.

Also, I want to be open about who I am and what my scholarly position is so here is a link to my professional webpage:

Overnight, news programs and internet sites blew up with stories about the island. They covered not only the immediate natural disaster but paraded every person that had ever looked sideways at Haiti to provide an opinion. Though Haiti is rarely front page news these days, it continues to pop up in news stories about the cholera epidemic, Hurricane Isaac, and the UN. Throughout, Haiti has been defined by terms such as diseased, evil, poverty stricken, lazy, and hopeless.  Lots of people are involved in charities, NGOs, and mission trips to save Haiti. Reddit even organized some successful donations.  Yet, few people really know much about actual Haiti. In a series of weekly posts and discussions I'd like to help change that. 

I plan to go through some of the major topics that I think are very misunderstood or just really interesting. The outline of my course is below, but I'm happy to adjust if anyone has specific requests. My first post will be Wednesday and the lesson will remain open for questions and discussion until next Wednesday when the subsequent lesson is posted. 

* **History of Haiti** - It is really more interesting (and fucked up) than you'd think

* **Vodou/Voodoo** - Strong female leadership, it permits homosexuality, and no sin? No wonder Pat Robertson hates it.

* **The People** - Being Haitian is more than just being poor and living in a tent city. I promise.

* **The Republic of NGOs** - The international presence in Haiti or in other words what happened to that $10 you texted after the earthquake?

* **Top Hats, Skeletons, and Zombies** - A lecture of the people's choice if there is demand for more.

* **Haiti's Future** - Hope, tourism, and education. What might actually help?



**Edit just to provide some more information:**
This will be part of the new History of Ideas Academy courses. The idea is that scholars, experts, and academics can use this opportunity to teach about what they study in a format that is interesting and accessible to the average person. This week we'll start the first two courses: Haiti Today and Hindu Religion and Indian Mythology. I hope you'll follow both. This teaser is a chance to see what the course will offer, make comments, and request anything related to the topic that you're interested in. Once it begins you can follow the entire course or just check in on the week you find most interesting. You can check the right hand side of the HOI subreddit at any time to see what courses are going on. 

The format of my course will be a post each week on the relevant topic along with links to photos I've taken and suggestions for further reading. Then, just like a live lecture, the post will be open to questions and discussion. But we'll stretch it over a few days so that both readers and I have time to respond. 

And in case you're wondering, here are my credentials. I'm a PhD anthropology student working on Haitian Vodou (Voodoo) practitioners in Haiti and America. I already have a MA in anthropology and have spent the past four years working with Haitian Vodouisants and traveling to Haiti. Anthropology stresses a holistic approach meaning that to fully understand anything going on in a community you really need to look at history, economy, politics, religion, kinship, language, etc. in order to put it in context. Looking at just one aspect out of context can result in a flawed understanding of the situation and poor decisions if you're trying to fix it (as is evidenced by some of the UN, USAID, and NGO approaches in Haiti.) I believe that anthropological approaches can be truly beneficial for organizations that want to make a difference in Haiti. After all, you have to understand what is wrong before you can fix it. But more than that, Haiti is an interesting and beautiful place that is incredibly misrepresented in the popular media. Come learn about the first free black republic in the world, an island that was once the richest colony in the world, a complex and beautiful religion, and a fascinating culture.

I'll start. Currently I'm studying for my law exam next week, but I try to squeeze some real reading in as well. Now the book I'm carrying around in my back pocket is [*The Prince*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince) by [Niccolò Machiavelli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli) (1513). I've read it years ago, but after attending [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/uii8u/quentin_skinner_the_genealogy_of_freedom_video/) lecture by [Quentin Skinner](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/search?q=skinner&amp;restrict_sr=on), and listening to him talking about Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes in [these Philosophy Bites podcast episodes](http://philosophybites.libsyn.com/category/Quentin%20Skinner), I just had to pick it up again. As soon as my exam is over, I plan to read Machiavelli's [*Discourses on Livy*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourses_on_Livy), together with [*Machiavelli and Republicanism*](http://www.amazon.com/Machiavelli-Republicanism-Ideas-Context-Gisela/dp/0521435897) for more context. If someone knows of a good book on Italian/European history in the 15th and 16th century, please let me know! Anyway, if you're interested in the history of political thought, I can really recommend having a look at Skinner's work!

 I figured that since the Hindu course is delayed until Wednesday I would go ahead and post mine. If you have not kept up with the course, you can find the outline **[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/10dk1n/haiti_today_teaser_for_upcoming_course/)** and the first post **[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/10ihjp/hoi_course_pearl_of_the_antilles_haiti_today_16/)**.

This section is on *Vodou* (AKA Voodoo), which is the traditional and still dominant religion of Haiti. This post is intended to introduce you to the religion, how this faith is lived, and its relevance to understanding Haiti in general. If you have any questions about Vodou or Haiti I'm happy to discuss them in the comment section below. I've spent years attending Vodou ceremonies, meeting one on one with priests and priestesses, and doing my own scholarly research. Enjoy and happy learning!

Next in HoI's scheduled series of ""courses"" is *The World of Ancient Egypt*. As a trained-and-teaching Egyptian historian and lifelong enthusiast, it is my job to bring to you a side of Ancient Egypt not often discussed in the general histories, or TV Documentaries.

To that end, I have prepared a six part series:  

[Part I – The Old Kingdom: Pyramids and Priests](http://egyptianhistory.libsyn.com/side-show-the-world-of-ancient-egypt)

[Part II – “High Egyptian:” The Literary Golden Age](http://egyptianhistory.libsyn.com/side-show-ii-the-middle-kingdom)

Part III – Calamity and Reprisal: Egypt’s 9/11 and its Imperial Response

Part IV – Akhenaten, or The Pharaoh’s Retrospective

Part V – The Counter-Reformation and the Ramesside Age

Part VI – The “Third” Intermediate Period and the Age of Alexander

and now, before we can begin, all I need is *your* opinion. How do you want this to be presented?

I write my lectures and save them as .pdfs, which I am happy to provide for your reading pleasure. However, I also have the means to record these as Audio Lectures. 

How do you like to receive your history? Through your eyes or in your ear?

Comment below, and if enough people prefer Audio then I will go ahead and start recording.

Take the Old Testament. The common idea is that during the time it was written, or vaguely ""early"" times, people took it just literally – and that only later people started reading allegories or multiple meanings into biblical texts or concepts.

For example the ""light"" spoken of in Genesis. Somehow there seems to be an agreement that its early meaning or at least understanding was that of physical light, daylight. Then later, in Rabbinic literature of the first century, this light is taken also to mean good deeds, in explicit reference to the bible; from there it gets interpreted as the neoplatonic essence of world and man – and so on through the development of various exegetical methods.

My point is: Do we know for sure whether people ever read the bible only literally? If so, how? And if not, how do we make educated guesses?

The lore concerning the Mahabharat is that a sage Ved Vyasa undertook the work of telling this story.
He looked for a scribe and Lord Ganesha agreed to undertake the task. He laid a condition that Vyasa would never stop reciting. Vyasa agreed on the condition that Ganesha wouldn't write down anything without first understanding it.
So began this marvellous journey of complex and intricate poetry and diction and understanding and penmanship.
It is said that Vyasa deliberately constructed increasingly complicated verses when he wanted a breather so that he could think about the next one.

Some facts about the Mahabharata:

It consists of 18 books or Parvas.
It is the story of the struggle between cousins which includes several undercurrents in the form of lust, betrayal, greed, anger and all the known human vices.

The primary characters in the Epic are Krishna, The Pandavas and the Kauravas.
The other characters are their families and supporters.

The Hindu holy text, the Bhagvad Gita is a part of this story.  It was recited to Arjuna by Krishna to free him from fear and indecision.

You can read an abridged version of the Mahabharat here:
http://www.gita-society.com/section3/mahabharata.htm

This is the Mahabharata that I have read most times and identify with.  This is a link for those who are interested in reading the entire story.
Here is a brief summary of the Mahabharata:
These are very useful links for someone who is new to the Mahabharata and succintly explain the content of the book and the most important plots and subplots.
http://hinduism.about.com/library/weekly/extra/bl-mahabharata-summary.htm
http://www.dharmakshetra.com/literature/summary%20of%20mahabharata.html

I invite you to discuss any and every topic/sub topic or incident, however small or seeminly unimportant.

Also, for those interested, here is a summary of the Bhagvad Gita:  

http://www.dlshq.org/download/bgita.pdf  

I will elaborate more on the Bhagvad Gita and the Hindu concept of Birth, Death and the After life in lecture 5 of this course later this week.

I look forward to your responses. I have not turned this into a lecture as such because the Mahabharat is very vast and in itself would take weeks to fully do justice to.  I do not wish to skim through the surface for the sake of keeping it short. This is the reason I have pasted the links to summaries. I would really appreciate it if you read one of those and I will go into full detail addressing all your queries and questions.
I request you, please ask and we will enrich ourselves with discussion and argument.

",20,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/x2mz8/psychotherapy_and_the_pursuit_of_happiness/,"Article by Ronald W. Dworkin

&gt; Freudianism sits alongside Marxism and Darwinism in the pantheon of modern theories held to be so revelatory that they not only gained the adherence of Western intelligentsia but shaped the broader culture. 

&gt; During the first half of the twentieth century, an air of intrigue and mystery hovered around Freud’s newly anointed practitioners. Psychotherapists occupied a strange universe, speaking in a language so incomprehensible but seemingly authoritative that it alternately awed and scared the average man on the street.

&gt; Psychotherapy is no longer an intellectual movement today as it once was. But in the form of modern professional “caring,” it has assumed a new role, which is to provide a peculiar sort of substitute friendship — what we might call “artificial friendship” — for lonely people in a lonely age.

&gt; To understand why this occurred and what it means for American culture, we must study the fractious history of the mental health field over the last six decades.

As promised, this is my first lecture on the Hindu religion and Indian Mythology.  I have created a short pdf file with my data as a self post would be a little too long and tedious to view.

Link: http://bit.ly/SiQX5C

Please feel free to give me feedback on my presentation and the content.  I would appreciate it if you let me know where I'm falling short and I will ensure that my presentation is better when I'm ready with my next lecture.

Also, if this method of creating and posting pdf files is not to your liking, I will try to do it another way.  Again, all suggestions are more than welcome.

I appreciate all your interest and hope that this is a good start to what is hopefully an interesting journey.

Again, I will start off with a Sanskrit Verse:  


*Om Saha Naavavatu. Saha nau Bhunaktu, Saha veeryam karvavahai.*  
*Tejasvi naavdheetamastu. Maa vidvishavahai.*  
*Om, Shaanti, Shaanti, Shaantih.*

**Translation:**  
May he protect us both - the teacher and the taught. May he nourish us both. May we acquire more strength (from knowledge).  
May our study be enlightened. May we not dislike each other.  
May there be peace (from physical obstacles), peace (from natural obstacles), peace (from supernatural obstacles).

And so, it begins!

EDIT: All discussions and comments for this lesson will be conducted till Tuesday next week when I will be ready with Lesson 2.  As before, please feel free to let me know if you require more coverage for any topic that interests you and we will work it into the lectures.  


Cheers!

1349317084.0,13,self.HistoryofIdeas,10wvbd,[HoI Course] Hindu Religion - The Philosophy and doctrine [HinduMyth 2/6],16,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/10wvbd/hoi_course_hindu_religion_the_philosophy_and/,"Hinduism is the religion of the Hindus, a name given to the Universal Religion which hailed supreme in India. It is the oldest of all living religions. This is not founded by any prophet.
Buddhism, Christianity and Mohammedanism owe their origin to the prophets. Their dates are fixed. But no such date can be fixed for Hinduism. Hinduism is not born of the teachings of particular prophets. It is not based on a set of dogmas preached by a particular set of teachers. It is free from religious fanaticism.

Hinduism is also known by the names Sanatana-Dharma(The eternal Law) and Vaidika-Dharma. (Vedic Law)  
Sanatana-Dharma means eternal religion. Hinduism is as old as the world itself. Hinduism is said to be the mother of all religions. Hindu scriptures are the oldest in the world, Sanatana-Dharma is so called, not only because it is eternal, but also because it is protected by God and because it can make us eternal.  

Vaidika-Dharma means the religion of the Vedas. The Vedas are the foundational scriptures of Hinduism. The ancient Rishis and sages of India have expressed their intuitive spiritual experiences (Aparoksha-Anubhuti) in the Upanishads. These experiences are direct and infallible. 
Hinduism regards the spiritual experiences of the Rishis of yore as its authority. The priceless truths that have been discovered by the Hindu Rishis and sages through millennia constitute the glory of Hinduism. Therefore, Hinduism is a revealed religion.

These are the words of Swami Sivananda.  

**Who is a Hindu?**

In a meeting of the Sanatana Dharma Sabha, Lokamanya Tilak said: “A Hindu is he who believes that the Vedas contain self-evident and axiomatic truths.”
The Hindu Maha Sabha has given another definition: “A Hindu is one who believes in a religion which has originated in India.”


**HINDU RELIGION**

“Those who burn the dead are Hindus.” This is another definition given by some.
“He who protects the cows and the Brahmins is a Hindu.” This is another definition given by some.  

Some define: “A Hindu is one who regards India as his motherland and the most sacred spot on earth.”  

Some others define: “He who calls and considers himself a Hindu is a Hindu.”
Some define: “He who accepts the Vedas, the Smritis (Remembrances), the Puranas and the Tantras as the basis of religion and of the rule of conduct, and believes in one Supreme God (Brahman), in the Law of Karma or retributive justice, and in reincarnation (Punarjanma), is a Hindu.”  

“He who follows the Vedic or Sanatana-Dharma is a Hindu.” This is the definition by some.  

“He who is a follower of the Vedanta is a Hindu.” This is another definition given by some others.  

“He who has perfect faith in the Law of Karma, the law of reincarnation Avatara, ancestor worship, Varnashrama Dharma (The system with 4 Varnas or castes), Vedas and existence of God, he who practises the instructions given in the Vedas with faith and earnestness, he who does Sandhya (Oblations and Prayer),  Sraaddha (Last Rites), Pitri-Tarpana(Water Oblations to God) and the Pancha-Maha-Yajnas(5 Great Sacrifices), he who follows the Varnashrama Dharmas, he who worships the Avataras and studies the Vedas, is a Hindu.” This is the definition given by some highly cultured men.  


**Origin:**

That part of the great Aryan race which migrated from Central Asia, through the mountain passes into India, settled first in the districts near the river Sindhu, now called the Indus, on the other side of the river. The Persians pronounced the word Sindhu as Hindu, and named their Aryan brethren Hindus. Hindu is only a corrupt form of Sindhu.
The Hindu Aryans spread themselves over the plains of the Ganga. Then the Persians gave the name Hindustan, or abode of the Hindus, to the whole of those districts between Punjab and Benaras.
The classical name for India which is used in Sanskrit literature is Bharata-Varsha(Varsha = Country) or Bharata-Khanda (Khanda = Province), after the name of Bharata who ruled over a large extent of territory in days of yore. Manu’s name for the whole central region between the Himalayas and the Vindhya mountains
is Aryavarta,( Abode of the Aryans). Another name for the whole of India is( Jambu-Dvipa). The Greeks gave the name Indu to the whole of this country. It was on account of this India became popular as the name of this country throughout Europe.
Hindu is not a mere name. This name Hindu is not only of geographical, but also of national and racial importance. The whole history of our nation from the very beginning is bound up with it.

All our ideas and ideals are so intimately connected with it that it is difficult to give a simple definition of it. Poets, prophets and Avataras came to sing the praises and glory of this name. Rishis, sages and saints took their birth to compile the Shastras(Tools) and Darshanas(Visions) for this nation. Heroes and warriors have fought for its honour and laid down their very lives for it. Piety, nobility, generosity, philosophy, religious bent of mind, Yoga, religious tolerance, wisdom, devotion, renunciation, Self-realisation. Ahimsa (Non-violence), Satya (Truth) and purity are associated with the name ‘Hindu’.

These are some basic facts related to the Religion.  I would like this to be more of a discussion post as philosophy is vast and however much I post, there might be aspects which I might miss out on. So the best way would be to discuss and address all topics not only pertaining to Hinduism but also in comparing it's ideology and philosophy with other Modern and Ancient Religions.

I hope this will be an active discussion and I'm looking forward to all your views and comments.
Also, I've included the meanings of words where I've used Sanskrit for better understanding.

* **1** - [**Global reach**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/sep/28/calvin-christian-church)  
Calvin's influence is still being felt today. But the reformer was a complex man, with a dark side

* **2** - [**A practical theology**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/oct/05/calvin-christian-theology)  
Calvin taught that Christianity is not genuine if its ideas 'flit in the brain', but only if they engender a change in conduct

* **3** - [**Knowledge of God and of ourselves**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/oct/12/calvin-theology-religion-institutes)  
Calvin's basic idea about human nature is that it is innately religious and that mankind is in rebellion against its creator

* **4** - [**Word and spirit**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/oct/19/calvin-reformation-theology-spirit)  
Calvin was against the idea that it's possible to meet God half way, or to provide conditions which ensure his grace will come

* **5** - [**Predestination**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/oct/25/religion-philosophy)  
Calvin's doctrine of predestination was not a mania. It was the only alternative to a God who plays dice

* **6** - [**The world**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/02/calvin-theology-philosophy)  
People have a picture of Calvin as an unrelenting puritan. But he is also strongly sensitivity to human liberty

[**Walter Kaufmann**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Kaufmann_%28philosopher%29)'s wiki page


--------------------------------------

**Set of 3 lectures from 1960:**

------------------------------------------

* [Kierkegaard and the Crisis in Religion](http://www.archive.org/details/KierkegaardAndTheCrisisInReligion)

&gt; Dr. Walter Kaufmann begins this series by explaining that existentialists share as many differences as other schools of philosophy. First coined to refer to the theories of Jaspers and Heidegger, existentialism became well-known only after the work of Kierkegaard, Sartre, and Nietzsche all radical individualists who found previous philosophical systems lacking. He explains their writings as an answer to the modern crisis in religious philosophy and morality.

* [Nietzsche and the Crisis in Philosophy](http://www.archive.org/details/NietzscheAndTheCrisisInPhilosophy)^1

&gt; Dr. Walter Kaufmann focuses on the contribution of Friedrich Nietzsche to the philosophical world, picturing him as a revolutionary heretic and the embodiment of the Socratic spirit. He traces in Nietzsche's works the craving for intellectual integrity, his break with Richard Wagner over the composer's anti-Semetic and anti-French sentiments, and ultimately, his madness, ascribed to having ""burned himself out.""

* [Sartre and the Crisis in Morality](http://www.archive.org/details/SartreAndTheCrisisInMorality)

&gt; Since it has not kept up with the results of science, the question arises, ""Is philosophy worth pursuing?"" Dr. Walter Kaufmann, in this examination of Sartre, suggests the breakdown of morals, institutionalized anonymity, permissiveness, and the population explosion have brought us to a crucial point of decision. This was forseen by the existentialists who did not share the vast optimism about scientific progress. The work of Sartre and Heidegger is contrasted along with a discussion of Jaspers and Tillich. He suggests both Sartre and Camus failed to alleviate the current moral vacuum.



---------------------------------------


**A lecture from 1973:**

-----------------------------------------

* [Prof. Kaufmann discusses Sartre, Jaspers, Heidegger, Kierkegaard](http://www.archive.org/details/Prof.KaufmannDiscussesSartreJaspersHeideggerKierkegaard)

&gt; Dr. Walter Kaufmann explores the origins, basic premises, literary influences, and relation to Christianity of existentialism, illustrating with Kierkegaard, Jaspers, Heidegger, and Sartre in comparison to empiricism, rationalism, and pragmatism.

As this field ties together the fields of history, philosophy, religion, art, literature, sociology and anthropology (and probably others as well), the potential for this to become a subreddit where students and practitioners of each field can broaden their horizons and learn from each other is obvious. 

**As of now**, the subreddit has a little over 200 readers, which is too small a number to generate interesting posts on a regular enough basis to make this happen. So far, the bulk of the posts have come from yours truly, but the next few months will be different. I'm entering a fairly busy semester in my studies, and will not be able to post stuff on a regular basis.

Therefore I'm looking for one or two mods who can post **at least 2-3 interesting posts per week**, preferably on a broad selection of issues, to become a mod in [/r/HistoryofIdeas](/r/HistoryofIdeas). The ""modding"" itself won't take much of your time or effort (not much spam or reported links detected so far, anyway), so basically the job consists of posting stuff. 

**The payback** consists solely of being an active and responsible part of a growing subreddit that historians of ideas *and* others subscribe to because the field is so darn interesting and because of the great links and discussions.

Post your interest in a comment here, or send me a PM. If you have an interest or credentials in a particular field, let me know. This is going to be awesome!

*I plan to have this discussion visible for some time, so don't hesitate to join in even if this thread is a few days old!*

**This week's topic: ""Are you certain?"":**

Inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/1k6zfr/podcast_deborah_black_joins_peter_adamson_to_talk/) submission by /u/Qwill2, I would like to suggest that we talk a bit about certainty. 


- What does it mean to be absolute certain of something as an individual? What are neurological, psychological, philosophical, religious etc. implications?



- What is interrsubjective or social certainty? What are some moral implications? E.g. the death penalty (""We are certain, this man/woman is absolutely guilty"") or fundamentalism of groups/societies?



- How does certainty and security go together? (War on terror, TSA scanners etc) And what happens if this certainty is destabilized? (by whistleblowers, for example)

- Is lying for the sake of security justified? (Iraq war, weapons of mass destruction...)

- What is the connection between knowledge and certainty? 

- What function does certainty fulfil in the discourse of science and humanities?


This topic also touches other thinkers that have appeared frequently in HoI:


**example #1:**

- “All good things were at one time bad things; every original sin has
developed into an original virtue.” *Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), The Genealogy of Morals*: How can it be that positions shift so radically over time when they are always presented with a fair amount of certainty?

- [more on Nietzsche and knowledge](http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie/vol9/Nietzsche.html)

**example #2:**

- H. Arendt and Derrida [on witnessing](http://psc.sagepub.com/content/37/6/629.short)

and of course

**example #3:**

- L. Wittgenstein, [On Certainty](http://web.archive.org/web/20051210213153/http://budni.by.ru/oncertainty.html)


There are, of course, tons of other connections to be made. This is only a very eclectic list. But I hope the topic is broad enough for people to make a contribution, yet concrete enought to get an enlightening discussion going.

So, what about certainty? What about you: what things are you absolutely certain of and why? And if you don't have such things, why not? 

Where do you see similarities and differences, e.g. between al-Farabi and Wittgenstein? 

How would you feel as a witness (Derrida/Arendt) in a trial that could result in death penalty?

What would you reply if Nietzsche told you to be the source of your own certainty?

What are some other contexts, maybe even your own experiences or the stuff you are working on / with, where the question of certainty could be asked?",,False,self,t5_2swgc,False,,,True,t3_1khmg4,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/1khmg4/are_you_certain_weekly_discussion_1/,

1352646743.0,12,self.HistoryofIdeas,130evn,[HoI Course] - Hindu Religion and Mythology - [HinduMyth 6/6],16,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/130evn/hoi_course_hindu_religion_and_mythology_hindumyth/,"As the last lecture on this series, I thought I'd make this a little fun.  This lecture also coincides with the Hindu festival of lights called Diwali. So it seems fitting that I include lore and stories on this festival and also give you guys something fun in the spirit of fesitivity.  

Let's start with the name Diwali. Also called Deepavali in some parts, Diwali literally means festival of lights. Yeah, I know we'd get all that from Wikipedia.
Let's elaborate some more.  There have been multiple significant events in Hinduism that need to be commemorated.  From our past lectures, we know that Lord Rama and Lakshman ended a 14 year exile and returned to Ayodhya, their kingdom to redeem their true inheritance.  Also, the Pandavas, ended their period of exile to return and stake their claim to the kingdom of Indraprastha.  It is also the festival which celebrates the death of Narakasura.  Unlike most christian festivals which celebrate births, most Hindu festivals celebrate deaths. Dassehra, Diwali etc.  

Talking about these old texts.  The books that we read today are highly sensitized and they try to gloss over many 'facts' or let's just say they try to mould it so that it fits with the poets world view for whichever era he wrote the text in.
For eg, in the Mahabharata, Bhishma had 2 brothers from his stepmother Satyavati. Vichitravirya and Chitrangad.  Chitrangad died childless and Vichitravirya, though young and untested ascended owing to Bhishma's vow of relinquishing all claims to any kingship.  Bhisma fought and won him 3 wives. Amba, Ambika and Ambalika. This wasn't uncommon. A king could rightfully stake claim to wives in this manner.  He defeats the armies of the defending father in law after all. Fruits of war.  Amba however, had a thing on the side going with the King of Salva. Bhishma hence, turned her loose. Amba went running to the King of her heart. The king, enraged at Bhishma and doubting her chastity, turned her down. It might also have been a result of male ego. We can never know for sure can we?  Consumed with Rage, Amba immolated herself after gaining the boon of being born as  Bhisma's bane in her next birth.  Now Vichitravirya was young and tuberculosis consumed him before he could get some despite having two wives. Who's to rule the kingdom now? Bhishma? Naah. Sorry guys, my vow will be upheld. Also, corollary of said vow says that Bhishma would not have any progeny. Bhishma ideally, put on an eternal promise ring. He is the very symbol of chastity and abstinence in Hindu lore. The great Grandsire. The strongest man, morally and intellectually. Also to a great extent physically. So the kingdom needed heirs. Satyavati had a son from another relationship. The sage Ved Vyasa. She called upon him to beget children from Ambika and Ambalika.  

Here's the interesting part. Our translations tell us that he LOOKED upon them once and they were with child. Truth is, things still worked the same way back then. No looky. Only touchy. Ambika saw the rishi and was so afraid at his frightful appearance with matted hair and such that she closed her eyes. Her son from that alliance was Dhritarashtra, who as we all know well, was blind from birth.  Ambalika though frightened too, turned pale and as a result, her son Pandu was born pale and weak. When Ambika was asked to get on the merry go round a 2nd time, she sent her maid instead. The maid was unabashed and went whole heartedly. She had a son Vidura who was the best amongst the 3. Wisest man and advisor to Pandu and then Dhritarashtra after him.
Remember how the Pandavas were born? The 5 gods? Yeah. Ring a bell doesn't it?  

Similar to Bhishma, there is a beacon of purity in the Ramayana. He is by far, one of the most prayed to and if I may say, popular Gods in Hinduism. Hanuman. The son of the wind. We might even go as far as to call him the first ever superhero. There are several aspects of Hanuman which endear him and are the reason why he is immensely respected. He is the greatest friend, most loyal servant and fiercest enemy. He never did wrong and accorded due respect to his enemies, even on the battlefield when faced with death. It is even believed that Hanuman is not dead. It is said he is immortal and that he lives in the mountains and the lucky few who have accumulated enough juice through years of penance and righteousness are gifted with a sighting.  

There are several instances in Hindu mythology where Gods are shown as lecherous. Take for instance, the way Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva accosted Anasuya when Rishi Gautama was out. Lore says they were bewitched by her beauty and wanted her for themselves.  Similarly, there are several instances like with Indra and Ahilya (you can check the story out on Wiki) where Gods are enchanted by beauty and just can't help themselves. Ditto with Anjani and Marut (Parents of Hanuman).
This might strike you as very similar to several stories from Greek Mythology. Like the birth of Hercules. The tryst between Indra and Ahilya has several parallels with the affair between Zeus and Alcmene. Both imitated the woman's husbands and the difference is, while Zeus sired Hercules, Indra was cursed to live as a Vagina. Literally. He was forced to bear the marks of a thousand Vulvae. Grotesque eh?  

There are several accounts of such illicit sexual transactions carried out by horny Devas. Indra in particular. If viewed purely as a character, Indra might actually come across as an alcoholic sex-addict. But he is the king of Gods after all.  

In today's society, a woman having relationships with more than one man would not be classified or titled with much respect. You know the words one would use to refer to said woman. However, Draupadi had 5 husbands. Interesting change of perception of women isn't it?  

Another great point to note is the mastery of the authors in enforcing a point of view upon the readers. When we read the Ramayan or the Mahabharata, we hold little or no sympathy for Ravana or Duryodhana who are depicted as the ultimate anti-heroes. We don't even need to think. Rama, Lakshman or Sita haven't wronged anybody. The Pandavas were right and so was Krishna is what we seem to remember.
Here are a couple of incidents I'd like to point out.  

Rama is comparatively pretty straightforward. He has little or no room for straying from the path of righteousness. However, remember how he hid behind trees and killed Vali as he tussled with Sugreeva? We seem to neglect that as it was undertaken for the greater good. Whose greater good though? Vali is said to have committed many crimes and the poet provides us with justification to assuage our conscience and reinstate our belief in Rama's righteousness after our momentary lapse in faith.  

Remember the training of the Pandavas? How Bhishma and Arjuna would repeatedly make fun of the Kauravas? It's a subtext. It can even be said to be a commentary on current times. If the Pandavas were present day, we'd have called them bullies. Let's face it. Bhishma and Arjuna were arrogant little meanies and they were arrogant even when they were grown up.  I'd like to think Duryodhana would've had sympathy.  IF the author desired, he could've very well chosen to focus on this aspect and justified all Duryodhana's actions as justice for the received bullying. Taking the Karma's a bitch route.  Remember how Draupadi laughed at Duryodhana and the little incident when he stepped into a pool thinking it was solid floor? She made a joke saying it's exactly what to expect from the son of a blind man. Hmm. Not very heroic is it? This is probably why Duryodhana tried to rape Draupadi in a hall in front of her husbands. I'm not saying it's justified. But it's enough to get you thinking isn't it?  

Krishna, God himself, chose to ignore rules while Ashwatthama, the clay elephant was beheaded to fool Drona. He ignored battle code of conduct while Karna was trying to free his Chariot and also cheated by blocking the sun (Yes, they DID fight in the shade) when Jayadratha was to be slain. Here, you find several points in the story where you could really choose to pick a side, but the author, masterly provides the right justification, time and again. Note how all the characters have shades of gray, but the author chooses to portray them as heroes. It's brilliant. For this reason, the Mahabharata is much darker than the Ramayan.    

I would suggest that you pick up Ashok Banker's version of the Ramayan and read till book 6. This is a brilliant adaptation and thoroughly entertaining. Just till book 6 however. After that, Banker's just gone nuts and started spinning tales trying to extend the Ramayana whilst generating interest and publicity in his vortex theory and to advertise his upcoming books. Read them by all means, but not on my suggestion. ( I have read them).  

Ravana himself is originally said to be handsome and resplendant. He is a monster only by virtue and deed. Not appearance. He was also known as Sundar Ravana or Beautiful Ravana. There are several good parts to him too. He might've abducted Sita, but he never touched her when he could've forcefully taken her at any time during her captivity. He just wanted her love. And Rama? He wages the war of the millenium to get his wife back and then casts aspersions as to her purity and makes her undergo a trial by fire. Subsequently banishing her. Tad douchey? Your choice.  

As of today, these techniques are pretty normal and common. But these texts are quite old and the way they're written, the sheer magnitude is majestic.  

To end this post and summarily, my lecture series, I want to wish you all a happy Diwali.  This is the time of the year, when kids go berserk with firecrackers and strut around wearing new clothes. In my mind, it's not about who died or who lived. It's about spreading cheer. Watching dozens of people come together to light the country up even though it's only once a year.  What I like best about Diwali is that it doesn't matter what religion you follow, you celebrate it. I celebrate Diwali, Id and Christmas with gusto. Also tried to sneak into a Parsi fire temple on Pateti but got a stern warning and was told not to try such stunts again. (My bad). I just love reading and trying to understand what goes into each religion. I'm not sure how to classify myself. But yes, I find my lack of faith disturbing. (Kudos Lord Vader). But watching other people who have faith and belief comforts me and I try to find that something which I can believe in.

Till then, I'm going to keep reading, keep trying to learn more and observe.  To all those who read my posts, criticised and commented, thank you very much. It's been a pleasure to have interacted with all of you. I wish you all a very happy Diwali and all other festivals to come.

Cheers!

It's slow going, mostly because I keep ending up with Norwegian history books in my lap (lately, it's been books by [Sverre Steen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverre_Steen)\). 

I've also finished Sigmund Freud's [*Introduction to Psychoanalysis*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Psychoanalysis) and Leo Huberman's [*Man's Worldly Goods - The Story of The Wealth of Nations*](http://www.amazon.com/Mans-Worldly-Goods-Wealth-Nations/dp/1406798207) since last time. Other than that, I listen to Mike Duncan's [History of Rome](http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheHistoryOfRome) podcast everyday on the way to work/university. Highly recommended!

Hello all, Sorry it has taken me so long, but I've recorded a second Reddit lecture on the Concept of Religion.

Find it on youtube:
http://youtu.be/c0r4TgksHSM0

Please make comments here on reddit.

This time I talk about:
What is religion? Is it really a cross cultural universal? Where do the modern European words for religion--from the German ""religion"" to the Portuguese ""religião""--come from? (Hint: the Latin ""religio""). I also discuss the history of most modern Euro-American terms for religion and gesture at the double-abstraction which has produced the modern category of religion. 

Hope you enjoy!

This is my second last lecture on Hindu Mythology.  Here is a link to read up on Hinduism's view on the afterlife.  

http://www.dlshq.org/download/afterdeath.htm  

I'd like to point out a few things.

Like the ancient River Styx in Greek Mythology, Hinduism refers to the River Vaitarni.
Hinduism refers to multiple levels of hell. Each hell performing a specific function of purgatory for the sinners based upon their sins.
Hindus believe in the concept of Karma where a soul has to pay for it's actions. In Hinduism, every soul takes birth to pay for it's past karma.
After a cycle of 7 births and deaths, a soul is said to have paid it's full due and rejoins Atman or the infinite.

Hindus perform last rites for the dead in order to ensure that they are provided for in the journey to the halls of Yama who is the God of Death.
Offerings of rice, cows, milk and shawls to Brahmins are made.  These ensure food, clothing and convenience for the dead in their journey across the Vaitarni.

The link has a lot more detail and discusses many points.  Again, there is a lot to expand on every little topic and one self post just couldn't do justice.
I invite discussion and would really appreciate any and all questions so that we may expand on topics that do interest you.",,False,self,t5_2swgc,False,,,True,t3_12pxhi,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryofIdeas/comments/12pxhi/hoi_course_hindu_religion_the_hindu_concept_of/,

Find it on youtube: http://youtu.be/n7qDfSSbG4I 

This time I discuss: 
The Early History of the European Concept of Religion (100AD-1600AD).
Why did Europeans barely write about religion (religio) in the Middle Ages? Put differently, why discussing of religion largely absent in the period often described as one of the most religious? Why in European encounters abroad did they not identify the religions of other cultures? What did they see instead? This lecture will trace the Christian conceptual schema that determined the European concepts of religion (idolatry, piety and heresy) in roughly the period from 100AD to 1600AD.

Hope you enjoy!
