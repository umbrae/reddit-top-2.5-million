Because of that, I have a database of every E3 related story (with timestamps and, in most cases, the body of the whole story). I also have an anonymous record of all searches performed by users of E3Feed.

I figure this data might be interesting to someone capable of analyzing it. You could probably do something like see what times certain types of stories are posted, or what news source was most likely to break a story first, or maybe even what news sources used the exact same wording for a certain story (meaning they either cribbed eachother or just reposted a press release).

Would any of you like such a dataset? If more than one person is interested, I can provide files in any format desired (XML, CSV, etc).

**EDIT**: Here you go:

[E3Feed Data Dump](http://c1277.r77.cf1.rackcdn.com/e3feed_data_dump.zip) (4.1MB zipped)

Contains: 

**E3Feed Stories (XML and CSV)**

-Fields: id, timestamp, headline, source_name, link, body

-Notes: 

* ""link"" is most likely non-canonical. URLs in RSS feeds tend to go through a click tracker or shortener. I try to resolve those to true links but there still appears to be a lot of RSSified urls. 

* Also, attempts are made to normalize all timestamps to the same time zone based on the offset between each RSS feed's timestamp and E3Feed's native time zone (central). Don't put too much weight on the timestamp's accuracy without seeing if there is a consistent bias for a given source.

* In cases where the article's body isn't included in the RSS feed, my system attempts to scrape the body text from the source URL. This occasionally results in bad scrapes.

**E3Feed Searches (XML, CSV)**

-Fields: id, timestamp, search term

-Notes: 

* For sake of anonymizing this data, no identifying data is included. If (for some reason) you'd like to do some kind of analysis that requires associating searches with people (to find behavioral trends or something), I can provide you with a copy that includes some kind of anonymized identifier for the user.

*License stuff:* In using this data, please keep in mind that the content of the story feed most likely belongs to the originating sources (the websites that published the stories). If you create any derrivative work with this data, please note this and please credit E3Feed (with the url E3Feed.com).

Where are my company's products being sold? Which products are being sold the most in any given region/state?

Consider an example of Moffat County, CO (The School District is the same as the county for this case)  [Wolfram|Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=area+moffat+county%2C+co) says the area is 4751 square miles.

I know I could just use a conversion factor, but for the paper I am working on, as well as for the sake of robustness, I would like to know what the units of measure from the shapefiles is. (Edit: The conversion factor would only work if its a linear relationship)

Thanks!

**tl;dr** The US Census could make their data a bit more user friendly.

[List of countries by English-speaking population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_English-speaking_population).

[List of Internet users by country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_users_by_country).

""List of countries by English speaking internet users""

---

Reason for the data? Countries have borders. But the internet is an international phenomenon. The main borders are language borders, with crossings in multi-lingual people, and tourists in internet translators.

It's pretty clear based on the data I do have access to (above data separately), that English Speaking Americans are the majority of internet users. They have over twice as many English speakers as second place India, and over twice as many internet users regardless of language.

This shows that the United States has the largest influence on the English speaking internet (obvious to most).

And this is the goal, looking at the influence different countries have on the English Internet.

---

India, it has the second highest amount of English speakers, and fourth highest on the amount of Internet users (hold your jokes please). Though the majority of their English speakers have it as an additional language, so that's probably why we see more British influence on the internet than Indian.

I am looking to do a project on teen pregnancy rates, mostly on how effective abstinence programs are. I have been looking for state, county, MSA, city, any local level of data on teenage pregnancies. So far, the CDC hasn't been overly helpful so hopefully someone here knows of something that I have been unable to find.

Thanks.

Perhaps I should explain a bit. I received a research grant to do some research on the societal costs of abstinence only education (as it relates to teen birth rates, etc.). While I expect that it will have negative costs I don't want to jump to conclusions, anyways a little help with finding the data would be immensely helpful.",,False,,t5_2r97t,True,,,True,t3_slb0p,http://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/slb0p/hopefully_reddits_sleuthing_abilities_are_better/,

I found this website containing which music was played on the given radio station a given date and time internal in hours (i.e 1-2 PM, 2-3 PM and ...). I would like to download and analyze this data, however I am considering the legality of mining the site. It has data from now back to January 2010. So that's 24*(days from January 2010 till now) queries to the server from my computer alone. 

I have two cases in mind. 1) Is it legal for me to datamine a website in that way and 2) could me querying the server that many time be considered spam and therefore maybe harmful?

I'm taking a time series course and have had trouble finding interesting data that hasn't been analyzed to death. I was hoping you could help me find an interesting data set :). I wouldn't ask if I hadn't looked for a really long time without finding something interesting.


Here are some of my criteria:

- Nothing from an R package
- Not really anything finance
- A description of how the data was collected
- At least around 200 data points, hopefully sampled at equal intervals

Here are some of the things I would ideally like/or am interested in:

- Public health questions (surveillance, which unfortunately the CDC doesn't do flu surveillance year round)
- Perhaps data from California, since that's where I'm from
- Computational biology (unfortunately these are usually short time series)

If it helps, I plan to use classical techniques which were taught in the course (ARIMA, state space models, spectral analysis, etc.)

Thanks!
