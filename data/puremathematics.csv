(I put the facts about spheres and those about ℝ^4 on the same level because they blow my mind in the same way, but in fact they aren't really similar: the interplay between the smooth and topological categories in 4-dimensional geometry is very special, because dimension 4 is ""high"" from the topological point of view and ""low"" from the differentiable point of view.  Exotic spheres in dimension 7, say, are much easier to construct and describe algebraically — e.g., the Gromoll-Meyer sphere, the Kervaire sphere or the Brieskorn equations — than exotic ℝ^4; but that doesn't make them easier to visualize.)

I'm not asking about the math itself: there are plenty of good introductions to the subject, e.g., [here](http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2008-45-04/S0273-0979-08-01213-5/) (a very nice survey on exotic spheres), [here](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1214458322) (constructing an explicit and—supposedly—simple exotic ℝ^4; requires subscription), or the book *Exotic Smoothness and Physics* by Asselmeyer-Maluga and Brans which really explains things from the beginning or again Scorpan's *The Wild World of 4-Manifolds*.

My issue is how you *visualize* the damn things.  I know that ""in mathematics you don't understand things, you just get used to them"", but that doesn't really help.  The problem is, for smooth manifolds, the intuitive idea I have of homeomorphism and diffeomorphism are exactly the same: I visualize two manifolds as being homeomorphic when one can somehow ""bend and stretch"" one into the other, and diffeomorphic, well, just in the same case.  Or to say things otherwise, ""topology"" intuitively seems to be the sudy of how manifolds fit together globally, and all the differential stuff intuitively seems to be about *local* questions.  Now obviously something is wrong with this intuitive idea, because it contradicts reality.

I'm an algebraic geometrist, so I'm quite comfortable with the idea that two manifolds (e.g., elliptic curves seen as 2-dimensional tori) can be homeomorphic as real manifolds and yet not at all isomorphic for some more rigid structure (algebraic varieties); but the problem is, differential geometry does not seem at all ""rigid"" like algebraic geometry is: partitions of unity seem to imply that you can freely split things in little bits and study everything locally.  So my intuition is all fucked up.

**References**: The post I wrote up followed a proof presented in this book: [Famous Puzzles of Great Mathematicians](http://www.ams.org/bookstore-getitem/item=MBK-63). The author of that book said he based his proof on 2 papers.

1. *How the Lion Tamer was Saved*, by Richard Rado, Mathematical Spectrum Volume 6 (1973/1974). [Abstract can be found here](http://ms.appliedprobability.org/content.aspx?Group=home&amp;Page=Back_Issues_6)

I was only able to find these abstracts, but perhaps those references can help and someone can find the full papers to share.

Firstly sorry for the lack of Latexing. I am no good with it but I am learning. I hope everything I have written is readable. Secondly [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ir37w/questions_about_the_circumference_of_a_circle/) is a link the the r/math cross post.

I have been investigating Minkowski metrics in R^(2). For those who do not know the Minkowski metric in R^(2) with a power, p, is 

d((x1,y1) , (x0,y0)) =  (|x1-x0|^(p) + |y1-y0|^(p))^(1/p) 

The equation for a unit sphere centered at (0,0) is then,

d((x,y) , (0,0)) =  (|x|^(p) + |y|^(p))^(1/p) = 1

You can see what these unit circles look like at the Wikipedia [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_distance). We are only dealing with p &gt; 1. Solving this for y (assuming x and y are positive) we get,

y = (1 - x^(p))^(1/p)

And now a differential length segment on this path is,

ds = (|dx|^(p) + |dy|^(p))^(1/p)

And the length of the unit circle in the first quadrant is then,

∫ds = ∫(|dx|^(p) + |dy|^(p))^(1/p) = ∫(1 + |dy/dx|^(p))^(1/p) dx
with 0 &lt; x &lt; 1

So the plugging in circle equation we found earlier we get, 

C(p) = 4 ∫(1 + |(d/dx) (1 - x^(p) )^(1/p) |^(p) )^(1/p) dx with 0 &lt; x &lt; 1.

So this is the circumference of the unit circle with a given Minkowski metric using that metric.

So I evaluated this integral numerically for several values of p and plotted the results [here](http://imgur.com/U1k0igP).

As you can see the plot has a value of C(1) = 8 then a minimum at C(2) = 2 Pi then raises again toward C(∞) = 8.

Also by inspection and intuition I thought that there was a symmetry with
 
~~C(r-1) = C(1/(r-1))~~

C(r-1) = C(1/(r-1) +1 ). 

I checked this out and it seems to be true. As gabgoh has pointed out this can be written as,

""C(p) = C(q) iff 1/p + 1/q = 1"".

However proving it algebraically seems like a nightmare. Here is a table that supports my claim:

|r     |1/(r -1) + 1 | C(r)        | C(1/(r -1) + 1)|
|----|------------|----------|---------------|
|1.1  |11             |7.51417    |7.51416          |
|1.2  |6               |7.14537    |7.14537         |
|1.3  |4.3333       |6.86894     |6.86894         |
|1.4  |3.5            |6.66555    |6.66555          |
|1.5  |3               |6.51954   |6.51954          |
|1.6  |2.6667        |6.41814   |6.41814          |
|1.7  |2.4286        |6.3511     |6.3511           |
|1.8  |2.25           |6.31027   |6.31027          |
|1.9  |2.1111        |6.28928   |6.28928          |
|2.0  |2.0             |6.28319   |6.28319          |

So my questions about this are why is there a minimum at C(2) = 2 Pi? The Minkowski with a power of 2 is the metric of our universe if nothing is too massive or moving too fast. I believe that the power 2-metric is the only one of these which is rotationally symmetric as well. So this metric seems to have a lot of nice mathematical properties.

The Minkowski-2 metric has the minimum circumference of the Minkowski metrics, but is it also the minimum of any more general class of metrics?

And can anyone prove that C(r) = C(1/(r-1) + 1) or equivalently ""C(p) = C(q) iff 1/p + 1/q = 1""?

Thanks for your time. I hope you find this as interesting as I do.

Edit1: Gabgoh has pointed out an error in my original claim. I have changed my proposed equality from C(r-1) = C(1/(r-1)) to C(r) = C(1/(r-1) +1). As well as adding in a table supporting this claim. He has also pointed out that this can be written as ""C(p) = C(q) iff 1/p + 1/q = 1"" which I have noted in the post.",,False,,t5_2s5dh,1374429615.0,,,True,t3_1ir7pa,http://www.reddit.com/r/puremathematics/comments/1ir7pa/xpost_from_rmath_questions_about_the/,

Every strong epi is extremal; extremal epis can be proved strong if you have pullbacks; so the notions coincide in pretty much any category you're likely to be working in. So for instance in **Top** the extremal epis = strong epis = quotient maps (as opposed to any old surjective continuous map).

What's more, the definition of a ""strong"" epi arises naturally when you try to work out what conditions you need to put on an epi to get unique epi-monic factorisation. Try proving that **Set** has unique epi-monic factorisation, for instance; you'll end up proving a lemma that states all epis in **Set** are strong.

The definition of ""extremal"", in contrast, seems to come out of nowhere. So why bother with ""extremals"" at all? Is there any use or motivation for the definition, or is it just some kind of historical hangover?

I was playing around with variations on the Look-and-say Sequence, and I came up with one that led to consistent stabilization, often resulting in a periodic loop.

Here's how it works:

* start with any number
* take the first digit of that number
* count the total # of occurrences of that digit
* remove them from the current number and append the count + digit to a new number in typical look-and-say fashion
* move on to the next digit in the current number and repeat until the current number is gone
* now repeat the entire process with the new number as the current number, ad infinitum

So, for example:


50

1510 (""one five, one zero"")

211510 (""two ones, one five, one zero"")

12311510 (""one two, three ones, one five, one zero"")

4112131510 (""four ones, one two, one three, one five, one zero"")

etc...

if you work out the entire sequence, you get this:

50

1510

211510

12311510

4112131510

145112131510

611425121310

16511422151310

61162514221310

26513215141310

22162551231410

42411625131410

34225116151310

23142225511610

42134114251610

34225113151610

23142225511610

42134114251610

34225113151610

23142225511610
...

Notice that the sequence eventually stabilizes on a three number loop that continues forever. My question is this: **is there a name for this Look-and-say variant, and are its properties novel or interesting at all? Is there a simple explanation for why this sequence always stabilizes?**

It reminded me of Conway's *Game of Life*, which is funny since he also did work on the Look-and-say Sequence.

I explain this to myself that I generally dislike the constructive proofs, such as talking about particular subgroups of a group of order n in algebra, or taking epsilons and deltas in analysis. However, it seems that general topology serves nowadays mostly as a base for other fields, and it doesn't seem to have many major unsolved problems if we define it to exclude more specialized fields such as algebraic topology.

Second, I've been studying category theory on my own because I find it very interesting on its own, and I don't think any of the classes in my entire program mention the concept of a category more than in passing. There are no category theorists in my department.

When I was introduced to the concept of a homeomorphism as an undergrad taking a grad level topology class, I asked the professor whether it made sense to study functions from collection of open sets of a topological space to the collection of open sets of the other space without having to talk concretely about a single open set or specific points. My professor said he didn't think that there was much to say there and basically brushed off my question as uninteresting.

I recently discovered that there is a field called pointless topology that deals with this exact concept and that the collection of open sets of a topological space is termed a lattice and can be dealt with on its own without talking about particular points of the underlying space. The Wikipedia article mentions that many results of general topology are analogous to those of pointless topology and that pointless topology has a strong connection to category theory.

My questions, then, are the following:

1. Am I correct that general topology is an essentially ""solved"" field if we exclude more specialized branches such as algebraic topology?
2. Is pointless topology an active area of research? Put another way, are there significant and interesting unsolved problems in pointless topology? If so, without having studying pointless topology, can I at least somewhat intuitively understand what those problems are?

I'd like to figure out what I'm doing wrong before I move to the next section, so hopefully someone here can help me out.

I'm reading ""Cybernetics"" by Wiener this summer, but I'm beginning to realize that some of the math is above my head. Rather than giving up, I'm trying to use this as a chance to improve my math maturity and ability to learn on my own. However, I'm stuck on one of the conclusions that Wiener makes about category theory. I'll start with the basics that Wiener gives (you can probably skip this part, it's kinda long...), then the paragraph on which I'm stuck. (Forgive me ahead of time, I'm very new to LaTeX).

(Skip this if you know the basics of category theory, but you may want to look at the notation I've used, since it will be used later in the paragraph I'm confused about).

We start with a group [;X;], which is closed under the transformations in the set [;T;]. This is a little different than group theory formalizations I've normally seen, in which the group is closed under a binary operator. The two are equivalent though, since we can replace the binary operator with a set of transformations [;T;] in which we've essentially partially applied the binary operator to every element in [;X;]. For example, if [;X = \mathbb{R} ;], and our binary operator is addition, we can replace that operator with an uncountable set of transformations [;T;] where each transformation in the set just adds some real number to the element [;x;]. 

I won't prove the following, but we can see that given [; s,t \in T ;], the transformation given by the composition of [; s ;] and [; t ;] will also be in [;T;], and so will [; t^{-1};], so [;T;] is a group closed under composition (with the identity as, surprise, the identity function).

We then define a character to be a function [; f : X \to \mathbb{C} ;] with an associated function [; \alpha : T \to \mathbb{C} ;] with the following properties:

* [; f(t(x)) = \alpha(t(x))f(x) , \forall t \in T;]
* [; f ;] and [; \alpha ;] both always return values of absolute value 1. This is nice since we can just think of the values of the functions as being angles on the circle defined by e^ix in the complex plane.

For example, when [;X = \mathbb{R} ;] and [;T;] is all of the additions (where [; t(x) = x + t ;] , I know this is a bastardization of notation, but Wiener uses it so bear with me), we can set [; f(x) = e^{i \lamba x ;] and [; \alpha(t) = e^{i \lambda t} ;] (same [;\lambda;]) and the relation holds. Similarly we can see that [; f(x) = 1;] works, just let [; \alpha(t) = 1 ;] and it's trivially true.

Wiener then states a very cool fact, the distribution of [; \alpha(T) ;] is invariant under multiplication by [; \alpha(s), \forall s \in T ;]. I'll try to keep this short, but it's really cool actually. First, imagine we change [;T;] by composing all its transformations with [;s;] to get the set [;T';]. Using the fact that [; s, t \in T \implies st \in T;] and [; t \in T \implies t^{-1} \in T;], it's easy to show that [; T = T';] and so their distributions under [;\alpha;] are the same. Furthermore, we can see that [; \alpha(st) = \alpha(s)\alpha(t) ;] as follows:

* [; f(s(t(x)) = f(st(x)) ;]
* [; \alpha(s)f(t(x)) = \alpha(st)*f(x) ;]
* [; \alpha(s)\alpha(t)f(x) = \alpha(st)*f(x) ;], f(x) can't equal 0, so
* [; \alpha(s)\alpha(t) = \alpha(st) ;]

So if we transform [;T;] to [;T';] by composing all [; t \in T;] with some [;s \in T;], we are transforming the distribution [;\alpha(T);] to [;\alpha(T');] by multiplying each element by [;\alpha(s);], so that we can relate the distributions of T and T' with [; \alpha(T') = \alpha(s)\alpha(T);]. But we just said that the distributions of T and T' under [;\alpha;] must be the same! Thus the distribution [;\alpha(T);] is invariant under multiplication by [;\alpha(s), \forall s \in T;]. Since the average value of a function is a direct result of it's distribution, we can also say the following:

* [; average(\alpha(T')) = average(\alpha(s)\alpha(T)) ;] , T = T'
* [; average(\alpha(T)) = average(\alpha(s)\alpha(T)) ;] , [;\alpha(s);] is constant
* [; average(\alpha(T)) = \alpha(s)average(\alpha(T)) ;]

This gives us two options: 

1. [; \alpha(s) = 1 , \forall s \in T ;], and everything works out perfectly.
2. The average is invariant under multiplication by something not 1, and is therefore 0.

(Sorry that took so long, onto the next part!)

Up to here I understand everything, but the next part doesn't make any sense:

""From this [fact about the average of [;\alpha;]] it may be concluded that the average of the product of any character by its conjugate (which will also be a character) will have the value 1, and that the average of the product of any character by the conjugate of another character will have the value 0.""

Here's where I'm confused. First of all, the first part of this conclusion doesn't rely on the revelation about [;\alpha;] at all. By definition, the product of a character and its conjugate is just the character [; f(x) = 1;] which obviously has an average value of 1. Furthermore, I don't see how the second part fits in with the [;\alpha;] conclusion either, and I think I've found a counterexample in any case. If we look at the following constant functions: [; f(x) = e^{i\pi} , g(x) = e^ {i\pi/2};], we can see that they both work as characters (just let [;\alpha(t) = 1 , \forall t \in T ;]). But we take the product of f(x) with the conjugate of g(x), we get:

* [; f(x) conjugate(g(x)) ;]
* [; e^{i\pi} e^{-i\pi/2} ;]
* [; e^{i\pi/2} ;]

This product is also a character, but it has an average value of [; e^{i\pi/2} ;], or [; i ;], not 0. Is there an implicit assumption that we're not using constant functions? Or am I way off the mark on everything?

Thanks for the help, sorry if I rambled on too long.

[; (A, a)_{a \in A} |= (\forall y) (\exists z) (\exists x) (z \not \in y \wedge \phi(x, z) \wedge x \in \bar a) ;]

to

where A is a (countable) model of ZF.  

I am probably missing something bleeding obvious, but I've been thinking about it for a while and I don't see how the conclusion follows from the premise. I can see how to use the axiom of collection (which, in ZF, follows from replacement) to derive something like 

[; (\exists u) (\forall y) (\exists z) (\exists x) (x \in u \wedge z \not \in y \wedge \phi(x, z) \wedge x \in \bar a) ;]

but I see no straightforward way to eliminate the indirect dependency of x from y through z. As I said, chances are that I am forgetting about something completely obvious: can any of you spot it?

For every recursive relation `[; R(x_{1},...,x_{n}) ;]` there is an n-ary ""predicate"" `[; r ;]` (with ""free variables"" `[;u_1,...,u_n ;]`) such that, for all n-tuples of numbers `[;(x_1,...,x_n) ;]`, we have:

`[;R(x_1,...,x_n)\Longrightarrow Bew[Sb(r~_{Z(x_1)}^{u_1}\cdot\cdot\cdot~_{Z(x_n)}^{u_n})] ;]`

Gödel ""indicate(s) the outline of the proof"" and basically says, in his inductive step, that the construction of `[;r;]` can be formally imitated from the construction of the recursive function defining relation `[;R;]`.

I have been trying to demonstrate the above proposition with more rigor, but to no avail. I have, however, consulted ""On Undecidable Propositions of Formal Mathematical Systems,"" the lecture notes taken by Kleene and Rosser from Gödel's 1934 lecture, which have been much more illuminating; but still omits the details in the inductive step from recursive definition, stating ""the proof ... is too long to give here.""

--

You're an observer on a plane with a finite number of infinity tall cylinders, or trees, all of equal width. As the observe, you're able to move anywhere on the plane, not occupied by a tree. From any position you can turn in a circle to see all around to count the number of visible trees. Your vision has a width, you're a cylinder, this allows you to see more. No two trees can occupy the same space or be closer, to the next nearest tree, than the width of the observer. And you can't see infinitely thin trees.

Questions
--

What is the most compact way to arrange the trees that the observer can see the greatest percentage of trees at any position?

What is the optimal width for the trees and the observer?

Can you describe a function for the observer that counts the visible trees as a function of position?

What are the variables at play in this scenario?

How much of a tree has to be visible for you to be able to see it?

What would be the best way to arrange an infinite number of trees?

What if the widths of the trees were different?

**Edit**: Clarified that trees can't overlap.

**Edit**: Clarified that you can't see infinitely thin cylinders, but I think that's the same as having the width of the observer equal to the width of the trees if the observer was also infinitely thin.

The Cesáro sum of a sequence {a_n} is defined a the limit of the average of the partial sums, that is, if we let

the Cesáro sum, if it exists, is defined as 

    \lim_{N--&gt; \infinity} s_N

It is a standard result of basic analysis that if a sequence of real numbers converges, the Cesáro sum converges to the same limit.  Also, there are sequences that do not converge, but for which the Cesáro sum exists.  For example, the sequence {1,-1,1,-1,...} has Cesáro sum 1/2.  

**My question** is about Cesáro sums in Banach spaces.  Suppose a sequence converges weakly in some nice Banach space (L^2 , for example).  Can we say that its Cesáro sum converges in some stronger topology?  This is probably a standard result about this somewhere, but I cannot seem to find any references for it, and so far I have not been able to prove anything myself.

* Are there any sort of properties two bundles share if they have the same trivial bundle? Maybe existence of a homeomorphism?
* [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_bundle) has exact sequence-like notation for fiber bundles.  Is the similarity between these purely notation or can we think of bundles as sequences (maybe if they are topological groups)?
* I'm still unsure about the hairbrush example (in the wiki).  E is the brush, B is a cylinder, F is a line segment, and the projection maps any point on the bristle to its base on the cylinder.  So let's choose a base point of a bristle and grab a neighborhood U around it in B (a curved disk region) and assume there are no other bristles in that region.  The part I'm stuck on is that pi^-1  of U doesn't seem to look much like UxF (a curved disk with a line sticking out of it and a curved-base cylinder, respectively).  I just can't see a homeomorphism between a line and a cylinder. Could someone clarify?
* [This wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle) states in the introduction that the hairy ball theorem shows tangent bundles to be non-trivial on 2n-spheres.  Seeing as the theorem is quite old and may have been developed before the bundle language, does anyone know if there are ""easy"" modern proofs of this theorem using bundles?

I'm a part-time game designer. I have invented a game system that builds on the rules of poker, offering exciting new player interaction. I have determined hand rarity by writing software that simulates the game, but I want to double-check using discrete math.

The game in question is ""Tournament Pilatch,"" and is built with the following deck:

3 suits (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
14 ranks per suit (1-10, J, Q, K, A)
(42 cards total)

Tournament Pilatch plays as follows:

Each player has 3 cards in hand.
Each player can bet on either 4 face-up community cards, or 4 face-down community cards.
The best 5-card hand wins. (A player must choose only 5 cards of the 7 she has bet on.)

What are the frequencies of the poker-like hands? (Pairs, Two Pairs, Triples, Full House, Straight, Flush, Straight Flush, High Card)

I have consulted [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_probability#Frequency_of_7-card_poker_hands) and re-purposed their method for Tournament Pilatch, but I encountered a philosophical problem. Notice in the derivation of 7-card poker hands, the frequency of triples subtracts the frequency of straights that also contain triples. This method, then, assumes that straights are more rare, and therefore more valuable, than triples, before the calculation is even complete! Isn't it more holistic to count the frequency of each hand, regardless of overlap, then determine which hands are more rare than others?

Furthermore, a player's ability to bet on either of two sets of community cards, intuitively seems to affect the rarity of hands. The Pilatch series of games has been in development for a few years now. While playing the game, we get a sense that some hands aren't as rare as they should be, or vice-versa. How should this be handled mathematically?

Within the paper I depict solutions of a diffusion equation in 2 dimensions under certain boundary conditions. I then compare these results to experimental results I have already accumulated. However, this is not the equation I would actually like a solution for, it is an approximation. The full problem is an integrodifferential equation that, while linear, is a bit nasty. Here it is:

du/dt-v(d2 u/dx2 +d2 u/dy2 )=C1+C2double integral (udxdy)

v is a constant, as is C1 and C2.

The domain is a rectangle. The origin is at the center of the rectangle. -a&lt;x&lt;a. -b&lt;y&lt;b.

The double integral is bounded across the domain. So integral from -b to b and -a to a.

Finally the boundary conditions are Dirichlet and the initial condition is 0.

I have a solution in hand for C2=0 (taking out the nasty integrals). I also have a solution to the full problem by the method of perturbations. However, according to math, does the method of perturbations actually give a true solution? It seems like it would give an approximation of a solution, but I am only well versed in solution methods and not so much the theoretical side of math. Also, does anyone know a way to directly solve this problem?

I have already dug through many math texts and solution techniques for integral equations, but none seem to cover solution methods for integrodifferential equations. The closest I can come to relevant methods are solution methods for integral equations that are Fredholm type of the second kind.

I know there are divisibility tests and there is a way to find it, but they're essentially made for human convenience (if a number is too big we want an easy way).

The full pdf can be found here: http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/05/16/1206569109.full.pdf+html

The question is regarding the following passage and has to do with linear algebra. They write: ""where Adj(M′) is the adjugate matrix (also known as the classical adjoint or, as in high-school algebra, the “matrix of minors”). Eq. 2 implies that every row of Adj(M′) is proportional to v. Choosing the fourth row, we see that the components of v are (up to a sign) the determinants of the 3 × 3 matrices formed from the first three columns of M′, leaving out each one of the four rows in turn. These determinants are unchanged if we add the first column of M′ into the second and third columns. The result of these manipulations is a formula for the dot product of an arbitrary four-vector f with the stationary vector v of the Markov matrix, v · f ≡ D(p; q; f), where D is the 4 × 4 determinant shown explicitly in Fig. 2B. This result follows from expanding the determinant by minors on its fourth column and noting that the 3 × 3 determinants multiplying each fi are just the ones described above.""

To understand the full context you will probably have to read the beginning of the passage, which is also very short. Yet my question is specifically regarding the formulated relationship between the stationary vector v of the Markov transition-matrix M and the Adj(M'), which is Adj.(M-I). As they say: Every row of Adj.(M') is proportional to v, which is sort of intuitive looking at Eq. 2, but I simply do not understand how they got that. Also the immediately following conclusion that the elements of v are the 3x3 column determinants of M' if you were to eliminate from the bottom of the fourth column.

Also to point out a petty mistake but v · f ≡ D(p; q; f) can't be correct as the dimensions do not link up correctly. v' · f ≡ D(p; q; f) is correct. But yet again I grasp that this formulation makes sense, but fail to understand how this can be arrived at.

1340679481.0,1,self.puremathematics,vly0w,A puzzle about the uncountability of the power set of the natural numbers.,1,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/puremathematics/comments/vly0w/a_puzzle_about_the_uncountability_of_the_power/,"Let me set up my puzzle in two parts.

**Part 1.**

Cantor's diagonal argument can be used to show that the power set of the natural numbers cannot be placed in 1-1 correspondence with the natural numbers. We can also understand the result to have to do with the cardinality of the set of functions from the natural numbers to {0,1} -- that is the cardinality of the set of functions from the natural numbers to {0,1} is greater than the cardinality of the natural numbers. We might further abstract away from talk of functions and simply understand the result to be about whether the set of infinite sequences of 0s and 1s can be placed in 1-1 correspondence with the natural numbers. By Cantor's diagonal argument, set of infinite sequences of 0s and 1s has greater cardinality than that of the set of natural numbers.

So far, so good. I'm convinced.

As a corollary, a presentation all sequences of 0s and 1s by pairing each member of the each sequence with a unique rational number in the following way is *impossible*:

pair the first character of the first sequence with 0 + 1/2
pair the second character of the first sequence with 0 + 2/3
...
pair the n^th character of the first sequence with 0 + n/n+1
...
...
pair the i^th character of the j^th sequence with (i-1) + j/j+1
...

And so we could claim that presenting the range of each member of the set of all total functions from the natural numbers as a sequence which could be placed in 1-1 correspondence with the natural numbers is impossible. The cardinality of the smallest set containing every range is uncountable, so the number of elements in the union of all those ranges is uncountable by a theorem of set theory.

And so presenting all the infinite sequences of 0s and 1s in a sequence of length omega is impossible.

**Part 2.**

If I'm thinking straight about functions from the natural numbers to {0,1} (and functions in general), I can represent any total function from the natural numbers as the union of all of its prefixes of finite length. In other words, if f:N --&gt; {0,1}, I can present the same information with the union of f {f | {0}} (f restricted to {0}) union {f | {0,1}} union ... . If this is indeed the case, for every natural number n, we can finitely represent *every* partial function defined on all the natural numbers up to and including n. If we form the sequence of 0s and 1s which is described the following way, then it seems that we can present ""in order"" every finite partial function from the natural numbers to {0,1}:

first list all strings from {0,1}+ of length 1;
next list all strings from {0,1}+ of length 2;
... 

For any n, we have provided all functions from the natural numbers up to n inclusive to {0,1}. And so, we've also provided every string of length 1 to n from {0,1}. But if this is the case, haven't we also provided that which was to be impossible from Part 1?

Bear with me, because this will be a little bit ugly from a formatting perspective.

Here's the initial boundry value problem:

PDE: du/dt = (a^2 ) * (d^2 u/dx^2 ) 

BC: u(0,t) = 0 ; u(1,t) = 1

IC: u(x,0) = 0

Transforming the problem yields the following boundry value problem:

ODE: w''(x,s) = (s/a^2 ) * w(x,s)

(The derivatives are with respect to x)

BC: w(0,s) = 0 ; w(1,s) = 1/s

Solving this (and doing a fair bit of algebra), I've been able to come up with the same solution as my textbook for the ODE in the s-domain. For simplicity's sake, I'm going to set b = sqrt(s)/a for this solution:

w(x,s) = (1/s)*(sinh(bx)/sinh(b))

The problem arises when taking the inverse transform. The inverse laplace transform itself requires integration in the complex plane, and I haven't taken complex analysis yet, so I'm limited to use of tables and computers. Unfortunately, WolframAlpha hasn't been much help in taking this particular inverse transform, and I won't have time to make it into my school's computer lab to get on Mathematica/Maple to find the solution. 

The solution my book gives for the inverse transform (and thus the PDE in the t-domain) is as follows:

u(x,t) = x + (2/pi)*(the sum from n=1 to infinity of: (((-1)^n /n) * e^(-t*(n*pi)^2 ) * sin(n * pi * x))

I understand how this solution satisfies the original IBVP, and I understand how the solution I got in the s-domain satisfies the BVP, but I'm getting stuck on how the above u(x,t) is the inverse transform of the above w(s,t).",,False,,t5_2s5dh,False,,,True,t3_qzetp,http://www.reddit.com/r/puremathematics/comments/qzetp/a_question_about_pdes_and_laplace_transforms/,

1.Take a function f(x)=x^2, then rotate f(x) around an axis. The volume of the resulting solid equals pi times the finite integral of f(x)^2 dx from a to b, can it be integrated in the same method (i.e. rotation around an axis) to determine hypervolume from any value a to b, and if so, how?

2.Same function, but an observation on rotations I'd like some critiques of; f(x) is 2D, but when viewed from a perspective where the center of your cone of vision is perpendicular to the x or y axes, it appears as a 1D line, and those are the only axes it can be rotated around to get a solid(can't do z, that's just a circle). My observation is that to get a figure of n+1 dimensions from a figure of n dimensions, you can rotate it around an axis where the figure appears to have n-1 dimensions. Is there a more accurate way to say that? It doesn't always work with 1D figures.

When I was reading about [the method Graham used to describe his number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham's_number) I get the definite impression that he had developed an iterated hyperoperator method, which is to the Knuth [up-arrow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation) what the up-arrow is to the exponent. But the articles I was reading didn't seem to treat that as significant, despite the fact that he had described a method to, as near as I can tell, 'hyperoperate' [hyperoperations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoperations) (and that in turn implies that you could develop functions that iterate that, and so on).

So, is that significant? Or does it produce numbers of such ludicrous size that even the most novel math theory is unlikely to ever need such a concept? And if it is significant, has someone noted the significance and it's just not on Wikipedia?

X is supposed to be differentiable, and therefore continuous.  Now I apparently only need to show that X^-1 is continuous.

As a sequence of uniform, countable elements approaches an uncountable infinity, we encounter an interesting phenomenon: the actual numerical (or absolute) value of these elements experiences a state of flux.  Allow me to illustrate.


Imagine, for example, that we have two identical reels of 35mm film, each of which stretches for 2.5 billion feet.  The reels are identical in every way and when stretched taut, they line up precisely.  At 16 frames per foot, each reel should contain 40 billion frames.  However, when each frame is counted individually, the reels contain a potentiality for margin of error.  Each reel’s frame-count becomes, then, 40 billion +/- *x* frames.  And despite their identical lengths of 2.5 billion feet, the count has the potential for flux in either direction.  One reel may contain 40 billion frames plus 1; they other may contain 40 billion minus 3.


Note that when using a phrase like “margin of error,” we must qualify that we are not referring to *human error*.  In a realist example, we would have to take into account the possibility that the 2.5 billion feet was not measured as precisely as possible.  Or that 75,000,000 frames were 1/100,000,000^th of a frame short, resulting in one less frame in the total count.  Or the fact that in reality, 35mm film stock is closer to 16.04 frames per foot.  We are not interested in precise calculations, only the theory of potential countability.


Why, then, when all measurements are assumed to be uniform, do we still experience this state of flux?  


The answer lies in the number itself.  The number “40 billion” was not chosen arbitrarily, but for the place it holds near the limit of individual human countability.  Continuously projecting a 40 billion-frame film at 24 frames per second would take over 50 years.  Assuming a count could be accurately maintained, it would take more than half a lifetime to achieve a result.  Now we must endeavor to count off each of the two reels in a closed environment, comparing the results only at the end of the process.  An identical result, as expected.  Predicted by the simple mathematics governing countable sets and thereby effectively removing this state of flux.  


But what happens when we double the length of the film?  Quadruple it?  Exponentially increase it?  We are left with a *theoretically*-countable number of frames, but of such a vast number that it would take even a powerful computer centuries upon centuries to individually analyze.  We can have no *countable* confirmation that the mathematics will hold true.


Thus, the very act of counting undermines the mathematical principles behind countable sets.  In direct contrast to a countably infinite set like {..., -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}, what we are describing is an *uncountably finite* set, such as {0, 1, 2, 3, …, 1x10^1000 }.   


To say that we have 9 trillion feet of film which consequently contains 144 trillion frames is all well and good and mathematically sound *until we begin counting*.  Since we “know” the measurement of 9 trillion feet to be accurate, just as we “know” the measurement of 16 frames per foot to be accurate, the only thing that counting frame-by-frame is striving to prove is that 9 x 16 = 144.  Mathematics is not here in doubt.  *Infinity* is in doubt.  


Can a finite number be *functionally* infinite?  The concept of *transfinite* numbers is well-known, i.e. numbers that are “infinite” in that they exceed all finite numbers but are not necessarily *absolutely* infinite.  What we are here postulating is a finite number whose usage is such that it functions as if it were infinite.  A functionally infinite number is one which is theoretically finite until we begin to count it.  


It is therefore the very *process* of counting that renders the number’s actual value uncertain.  The absolute value of any cardinal number is easily determined by its integer – the absolute value of 3 is 3, the absolute value of 14 is 14, and so on.  [For simplicity’s sake, we are here discussing cardinal numbers rather than all rational, irrational or transcendental numbers.]   But as soon as a count begins, the number’s potential for infinity throws its absolute value into flux *until the count is either completed or abandoned*.  Like an inverse of Schrödinger’s cat (which exists in a quantum state of both life and death until observed), the uncountably finite number achieves a quantum state of both ""finity"" and infinity *while being counted*.  When the count is completed, the absolute value is affirmed.  If the count is abandoned, the number reverts to its accepted absolute value.


This is not to suggest that in the counting process we might encounter an entirely new integer.  Or that an integer as it would appear in a complete sequence might slip from existence.  It is merely intended to illustrate the push-and-pull power that infinity holds over the absolute value of elements in a countable set.


Just as *Tristram Shandy*’s eponymous narrator spends the entirety of his life writing his autobiography, only to find that the recounting of his life would require every available moment of his life many times over (in nine volumes, he succeeds only in recounting the story of his birth and accidental circumcision), we find that a countable set becomes functionally infinite very quickly.

Well, that's it.  I hope you had as much fun reading that as I did writing it.  Lemme know what you think, boys &amp; girls!

Now, how am I supposed to solve this problem? What rule should I be following or thinking of? I couldn't think of anything except maybe like y = |x| - 8 or y = |x| + 8 

The lines between x means the absolute value, right? So....I'm not sure, thanks guys. 

Oh by the way the answer in textbook says: 

""Since the graph of y = |x| is translated 8 units right, replace x with x-8. 

y= |x| 
y= |x-8|""

I have a little problem here that I am trying to work out but I can't solve... Really the problem here is that I'm a terrible Mathematicain! But I'm here to learn!!!!

The problem is simple (or at lease simply explained) and I have included a piece of a larger table (attached xls) that has all the information.

I run a comic book shop and I am developing a website for selling the comics. Unfortunately I have to input the prices of the comics manually. My web developer has made things easier for me by creating a program that allows me to input the prices. Now, there is a price guide that I am using but there are some problems. First of all, there are 17 different grades for the comics (ie, NM+, mn, mn- vf+, vf,vf-) and so on. Now, the guide lists the prices in NM-, VF, f, VG and G. When I looked closely at the prices I realised that there was not a constant relationship between the values. For example, when a comic is valued at $3 NM-, the price of the same comic in the condition VF is 66% of the NM- price. But when the comic is priced at $100 NM- the VF price is only 45% of this value.

The table below states the different values of NM-, beneath that is the percentage (expressed in decimal form) of that value. So what I was looking for was a formula to determine the percentages of the lower grades when the NM- value is input. The goal is to be able to integrate this formula into my website so I can accurately price all the comics.

If anyone could show me how to solve this problem or even point me in the right direction I would be truly grateful as it would be a tremendous help!!!

The link below is to an spreadsheet with the full table.
