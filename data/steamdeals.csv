**EDIT: I was wrong. The sale did not begin on this date. See [FAQs About Steam's Big Sales](//www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/vnrr5) for further information.**

Reddit has been a great place to get information on these sales, thanks to redditors like [ltx](//www.reddit.com/user/ltx), [Remmib](//www.reddit.com/user/Remmib), [squidthesid](//www.reddit.com/user/squidthesid), [CommentStatistics](//www.reddit.com/user/CommentStatistics) and others. Subreddits like /r/gaming and /r/games have played host to these redditors' daily posts, while subreddits such as /r/steamdeals and /r/GameDeals have carried the torch between the big sales. Thanks to you all! You make these sales so much fun!

*Sadly, ltx will only be available to do his daily posts on the weekends. But we've got you covered. Remmib will be on hand to do his daily posts and I've offered to step in for ltx on weekdays. Plus, squidthesid has agreed to once again provide his excellent commentaries on the games (see below for an example of his work).*

**But here's where I need help from all of you.**

I'd like your input on the ways we could improve the daily sales posts. Below is a template for my daily sale posts. It is based on previous sale posts by ltx and Remmib (such as [this](//www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/nv4os/steam_holiday_sale_2011_day_11/) and [this](//www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/nv4ok/steam_holiday_sale_day_11_useful/)).

What should be added? Changed? Removed? I'm particularly interested in those pieces of information that are most helpful to redditors when deciding whether or not to buy a game.

Keep in mind that there is a 10,000 character limit on self-post text, so we'll need to be choosy and include only the most useful information. Also, assembling the information for these posts is time-consuming, so any resources (such as [this](//steamdrm.flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=DRM_Lists/The_Big_DRM_List) and [this](//www.steamprices.com/)) you can provide for finding information is most appreciated.

1324478964.0,67,self.steamdeals,nla4m,"Hi /r/steamdeals, we're running a few more game giveaways to celebrate our involvement in Steam's giant holiday sale and treasure hunt.",77,10,256,http://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeals/comments/nla4m/hi_rsteamdeals_were_running_a_few_more_game/,"**UPDATE**: The contest winners have been picked, with all details in the applicable giveaway comment threads below. Thanks so much everyone for making this an awesome experience. Hope everyone has a safe and relaxing weekend!

**Original**: Hi everyone, one of the Arcen Games guys here. To celebrate our involvement in Steam's Holiday Sale and Gift Pile Treasure Hunt we're stopping by some of our favorite subreddits to run a few giveaways of our games now through December 31st.

What we'll be giving away, and where you can get it (on the cheap) if you don't win it:

**Steam Titles**

You can grab our deep space strategy title [AI War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400) and any/all of its DLC for 75% off through December 31st (even more savings if you go with the Alien Bundle which is everything together.) Not only that but it has a featured achievement Steam users can unlock to earn and win more stuff through the current [The Great Gift Pile treasure hunt event](http://store.steampowered.com/holidaysale) running in conjunction with the huge sale.

Our unique puzzler [Tidalis](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40420/) is 80% off on Steam as well. If you're into deep block-based puzzling (note: not match-3) for $2 instead of $10, make sure to take advantage of the hefty discount.

**Non-Steam Titles**

Our in-development sprawling 2D sidescroller [A Valley Without Wind](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-buy) is available for pre-order now through our site at 50% off the launch price (at the moment it's $10 as opposed to $20.)  You can also grab it on MacGamesStore, Impulse, and GamersGate. Currently in public beta the game is not yet available on Steam, but if/when it does arrive the licence key you'll receive will work to activate the game on Valve's client.


If you'd like to try any of these games you can find the AI War demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/aiwar-downloads), Tidalis demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/tidalis-downloads), and AVWW demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-downloads). The AI War and Tidalis demos are also available through Steam, though I believe that those are just the PC versions.

How you can participate in the giveaway:


Per request I'll be giving out the keys by asking in the comments for a number between such and such, so I can use a RNG to pick a winner. If the winning number has been selected by more than one person than I'll renumber those who picked right and roll again. If no one picked the number that comes up, I'll find the number closet to--and you can go over (not PiR rules.) The threads are open until I edit the original post saying differently. I'll close them sometime in the next day or so, figure out the winners, and deliver the licence keys to their inboxes.


We'll be adding extra keys to the drawing as we reach various milestones in upvotes, points, and participants to add some incentive for those participating to upvote and get everyone here involved. Basically, as this post accumulates more points and entries, I'll add in extra keys and draw additional winners for them accordingly.


If you do end up picking up [AI War](http://reddit.com/r/aiwar) or [A Valley Without Wind](http://reddit.com/r/avww) during the sale/giveaway, consider checking out their respective subreddits for regular updates and discussion.


Thanks everyone and best of luck! Happy Holidays. :D

Love,

[Arcen Games](http://twitter.com/arcengames)

**Edit**: An amendment to the rules above as wisely suggested by Reddit user cyantist. The reasoning is good enough for me:

*I want to encourage you to run the random number generator until you get a hit, rather than find the closest number submission. Shouldn't everyone get an equal chance? If 3 people choose 13, 14, 15 for a chance to win AI War, why then should 14 get a 1/81 chance of winning and 13 and 15 have more than that?*

*Why should people who post later get better chances? (Due to the fact that they can choose numbers relative to those who have already posted.)*",,False,self,t5_2riw6,True,,,True,t3_nla4m,http://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeals/comments/nla4m/hi_rsteamdeals_were_running_a_few_more_game/,

1322478643.0,68,self.steamdeals,mrw8p,AI War and Tidalis (our games) are on massive sale for just a few more hours on Steam. We have some spare codes to giveaway as well.,87,19,179,http://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeals/comments/mrw8p/ai_war_and_tidalis_our_games_are_on_massive_sale/,"**FINAL UPDATE**: The giveaway is now closed. Thanks for all who participated in this! I hope to be back very soon with a similar giveaway for our titles. :D

**[AI War Giveaway (CLOSED)](http://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeals/comments/mrw8p/ai_war_and_tidalis_our_games_are_on_massive_sale/c33cpl9)**: This thread is now closed. No more entries or changes. Since this post reached above 50 points, I'm changing this up a bit. Now instead of one winner, we have three (same as the other two threads thanks to the upvotes), but for the first two numbers I generate, the prize isn't just AI War anymore. It's the entire AI War Alien Bundle--the base game plus all three expansions! The third number will still get the original prize of the base game. So quite an upgrade for all who entered. :)

The first number generated is 111 (not a mistake, though I was surprised too!), that means SorrowsJudge has swung for the fences and hit a home freakin' run. The second number generated is 70, meaning otarU is the closest with a guess of 69. Congrats to both for winning the grand prize Alien bundle, woo!!!

The third number generated is 17, that means boob is right on the money as well, way to go boob! A copy of AI War awaits in your inbox.

**[Tidalis Giveaway (CLOSED)](http://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeals/comments/mrw8p/ai_war_and_tidalis_our_games_are_on_massive_sale/c33cqac)**: This thread is now locked. Our first number generated is 46, which means janizary nailed it on the dot! Our second number generated is 24, that means misfeasor and boombar both hit it on the head. I was going to do a run off, but since they both guessed exactly right, it's better if they both win copies. Our third number generated is 50, which means OlgM guess exactly right! Congrats to you four and check your respective inboxes for your copy of the game. :)

**[A Valley Without Wind Giveaway (CLOSED)](http://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeals/comments/mrw8p/ai_war_and_tidalis_our_games_are_on_massive_sale/c33csbu)**: This thread is now closed. The first number generated is 139, that means Turneepz is the closest with a guess of 133! Our second number generated is 309, that means quamper nailed it exactly! Our third number generated is 56, which means with a guess of 53 Menagruth is the closest to. The three of you check your inboxes for a copy of AVWW. :)

**ORIGINAL**:Hi! Our titles are up on Steam at big discounts through this morning. You can grab our deep space strategy game [AI War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400) and any/all of its DLC for 75% off, and our puzzler [Tidalis](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40420/) for 80% off, or just $2 instead of the $10 tag.


So we wanted to throw out a last minute reminder, but instead of just barging in and yelling at everyone about the sale, we thought it'd be best to do a giveaway of our games for those who are interested in participating. On top of the aforementioned titles currently on sale, we'll be giving away a key for our latest effort A Valley Without Wind (currently available in [public beta for $10](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-buy)) as well.


Per request I'll be giving out the keys as such: I'll be commenting requests for a number between such and such, so I can use a RNG to pick a winner. If the winning number has been selected by more than one person than I'll renumber those who picked right and roll again. If no one picked the number that comes up, I'll find the number closet to--and you can go over (not PiR rules.) The threads are open until I edit the original post saying differently. I'll close them sometime tomorrow, figure out the winners, and deliver the keys to their inboxes.


If you do end up picking up [AI War](http://reddit.com/r/aiwar) or [A Valley Without Wind](http://reddit.com/r/avww) during the sale/giveaway, consider checking out their respective subreddits for regular updates.


Thanks everyone!

**EDIT 1**: You can find the AI War demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/aiwar-downloads), Tidalis demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/tidalis-downloads), and AVWW demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-downloads).


**EDIT 2**: Let's add a little incentive for those participating to upvote. Each time the main submission hits a 10 point milestone (points, not upvotes) I'll draw a second number from one of the giveaways, so for example if this post reaches 30 points by the time I draw tomorrow there will be 3 additional winners selected. Basically, as this post accumulates more points, I'll add in extra keys and draw winners for them accordingly.

**SuperEdit**: Just to protect myself from my boss killing me on this incentive thing, if/when this post reaches 50 points I have to stop adding keys. However to make up for this, instead of a key I'll throw in a bundle at that point, as well as at 100, 250, and 500.

**THQ Complete Pack** - For those that missed any THQ deals, or are considering games that didn't go onsale, there is also the [THQ Complete Pack](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/4587/) for $99.99 which includes *all* THQ titles at a savings of ~$280.

(All titles except *Darksiders*, *The Search for Amelia Earhart*, and *STALKER: Call of Pripyat*)

Additionally, Holiday sales are coming soon.

___

Speculation:

THQ really doesn't have that many games listed on Steam, so I am expecting either a *Dawn of War* or *Company of Heroes*-themed sale this week. Also, *Metro 2033* just dropped to $40 from it's original $50, so I think it unlikely that it will be reduced further (but it might (edit: lol, it did)). *Full Spectrum Warrior* is definitely on the table, however, and I wouldn't be surprised to see both games in the sub-$5.00 range if they go on sale. Additionally, a stand-alone game such as *Saint's Row 2* or *STALKER* is likely at some point during the sale. Darksiders was just released ($40), so I doubt we'll see a sale for it.",,False,self,t5_2riw6,True,,,True,t3_dwb6s,http://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeals/comments/dwb6s/thq_sale_all_this_week_check_back_daily_for_75_off/,
