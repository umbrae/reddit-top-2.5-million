Last weekend I threw together a little GUI  utility to make the process of running games in a separate X server really easy. I wrote it very quickly and it probably has lots of bugs, however this week it has worked well for me in replaying Bastion. Now I'd love to get feedback from other Linux gamers! :D

**Screenshots, and .deb download link:** http://michaelb.org/fsgamer/

Make sure you follow the installation instructions: there are a few terminal commands to run!

Lemme know if it breaks for certain games, or if the installation instructions don't work for you.

Benefits of running a game this way:

* No matter what the game is, you can easily switch between the game and your normal desktop using `Ctrl+Alt+F7` to get back to your desktop, and `Ctrl+Alt+F8` to get to your game. Even games that typically prevent `Alt-Tab` cannot block these keys!

* It may run faster, especially if you are using a Unity on 12.04

* If the game crashes the X server for some reason it won't take out your other applications

* Even games that allow switching back to other applications sometimes mess up when you restore their size, or take a while to minimize, or have various other mess-ups with full screen such as the menu bar appearing over them. A separate X server will always be fullscreen with no fuss.

Future plans: I have a few more ideas floating in my head to use this system to make multiple monitor gaming *just work* on Linux, by making your primary x session stop using your first display, then running a separate x session with the full screen game in the new display. This way you can keep your normal desktop running with windows, etc, and use Ctrl+Alt+F7 and Ctrl+Alt+F8 to switch between the game and your desktop, as with the single monitor (I think that would work, right?). Thoughts?

Note: I was learning `quickly` and Gtk in the process, so it is very sloppily coded and filled with hacks (the goal was just to get something to work). Because of this **if you are running OpenBox it won't start**, sorry :P I'll fix this when I get a chance

People have been claiming that Steam on Linux deployment has gone down. No such thing has happened! It's very ignorant and counter-factual to say so, and bad for our reputation amongst developers, investors and potential new users.

If one looks at the latest survey, one can note that total Windows Steam deployment share went down by 0.15%. MacOS went up by 0,09% and Linux went up by 0.21%! Linux is clearly gaining on the other operating systems, but not perhaps as rapidly as we would like.

The main reason for the confusion was that previously distros with very small marketshares were listed - now they have been grouped as ""Other"". Of course, this might not only be Linux-based operating systems, but even if such was the case our marketshare is the one which is increasing the most, and *certainly* not decreasing.

I started looking at the launcher script and the Steam directory layout and ran into some really poorly done things. If anyone knows how to forward these points to the Steam devs at Valve, feel free to do so. On request, I'll add a dozen more points, I'll just list some examples below to show you why I consider this to be done poorly.

* **Steam messes with files which are supposed to be handled by the package manager:**  
  The Steam launcher script (*~/Steam/steam.sh*) runs the following code:

    sh ""$UPDATESCRIPT"" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 || gksudo --disable-grab --message $""Enter your password to update $STEAMSCRIPT"" sh ""$UPDATESCRIPT""

  This means, that Steam will overwrite the file *$STEAMSCRIPT* which is located at */usr/bin/steam*. Files in */usr/bin* should be **never ever** created/modified by anyone else than the distribution's package manager. If you want to do, what Steam does here, create a copy of this file in */usr/local/bin* (which is usually prefixed to */usr/bin/* in *$PATH*) and modify this one. Everything else is just really bad.  
  If it would be really properly done, Steam would leave updating of any system wide files to the distribution's package manager, but this is probably a little out of the scope to be expected here…

* **The launcher is missing fundamental error checking**  
  A shell script which is ran out of CLI context should always deal with possible errors in a way which makes it possible for non-technical users to see what's the problem when something goes wrong. 
  Right now, Steam runs this code:

    sh ""$UPDATESCRIPT"" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 || gksudo --disable-grab --message $""Enter your password to update $STEAMSCRIPT"" sh ""$UPDATESCRIPT""

  But before running this code, the script doesn't check at all, whether *gksudo* can be executed at all and just silently keeps executing the following code, even when this line couldn't be ran at all. The other bad things happening in this line of code have been described in the previous point. Furthermore, this line should be changed to be a little more cross-desktop friendly, use *kdesu*/*kdesudo* on KDE environments etc.

* **The launcher script is using the not quite most elegant bash-code**  
  There are some rather clumsy things done in the launcher script:
  * Instead of using bash builtin parameter substitution, *sed* is used which requires another context switch/subshell to run (slower execution, more error prone). Furthermore does it use backticks instead of $() which makes the code harder to read:  
    **current code:** *PLATFORM32=\`echo $PLATFORM | sed 's/64/32/'\`*  
    **improved code:** *PLATFORM32=""${PLATFORM/64/32}""*  
  * Improper use of tools. Instead of using the *-q* argument of *grep*, the output of a *grep* operation is redirected to */dev/null*. Furthermore the used regex is made harder to read by using *\^[Uu]* instead of simply using *grep*'s *-i* argument:  
    **current code:** *egrep '\^[Uu]niverse *= *[Bb]eta$' ""$STEAMROOT/Steam.cfg"" &gt;/dev/null; then*  
    **improved code:** *grep -qi -e '\^universe *= *beta$' ""${STEAMROOT}/Steam.cfg""; then*  
  * It uses deprecated tools, here for example *fgrep* (see also the previous point, where *egrep* is used). From the *grep* manpage:

&gt;Direct invocation as either egrep or fgrep is deprecated, but is provided to  allow  historical applications that rely on them to run unmodified.



I could continue this list forever focussing on the launcher script alone and there are 10 times more bad things on the whole application. So if anyone knows how to forward this to the Steam devs at Valve, feel free to do so… when requested, I'll add some more points.

GOG, being an online computer game retailer that firmly believes in selling games without Digital Rights Management (DRM) and without regional pricing (1€ ≠ 1$), among other things, would in my opinion make a great addition to gaming on Linux and should thus be flooded with votes to make their resistance ever more futile.

...

**Note regarding Games awaiting Greenlight approval**

Also see [Steam Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=765) - last time I checked there were 200+ games that were hoping to get Greenlit that stated that they'd be supporting Linux.  There's ones that have clearly done little development and others that just look awful, but lots of good stuff in there too (e.g. [Receiver](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=92927535), [Fotonica](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=109260745), [Legend of Aethereus](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=92957124), [Monster Minis Extreme Off-Road](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=93025511) etc etc).  Obviously, you can support those games that seem good by voting them up on greenlight (note: it is possible to filter for just games with linux versions stated)

...

**Awaiting responses from developers**

Air Forte, Atom Zombie Smasher, Cortex Command, Bullet Candy (Perfect), Eufloria, Fieldrunners, Jamestown, Legend of Grimrock, Limbo, Lone Survivor, Torchlight

...

**Existing or greenlit games where the news ain't so good** - [**Super Meat Boy**](http://steamcommunity.com/app/40800/discussions/0/864951475490355056/), [**Incredipede**](http://forums.incredipede.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=24), [**Spirits**](http://steamcommunity.com/app/210170/discussions/0/828925849236164379/), **Wizorb** (""we have no plan to release Wizorb on Steam"" via email), Amanita-design games (**Machinarium**, **Samorost**, **Botanicula**) - (""well, we do think about it but right now we are too busy.

Here's a [more detailed infograph](http://i.imgur.com/fuUzL0d.png) (x-post from /r/steam).


* When you checkout, always buy as a **Gift** and choose to store the games in your inventory. When you decide to play a game for the first time, you just activate it from there first. That way, unopened games you never play (time constraints, lost interest, ...), can still be traded to other people (or given away!).

* Use [SteamDB](http://steamdb.info/linux/) to **verify** if a game runs unders Linux (sometimes the Tux icon is missing while the game works fine).

Hello /r/linux_gaming, today I've released a multi-architecture `.tar.xf` binary archive of my game, Open Hexagon, version 1.92.

I've tested it both on `Linux Mint x86` and `Linux Mint x64`, and it seems to work properly.

**Download at:** http://vittorioromeo.info/projects.html

**Discuss, share your creations:** http://www.facebook.com/OpenHexagon

**GitHub:** https://github.com/SuperV1234/SSVOpenHexagon

To play, simply extract the archive, then execute the `OpenHexagon` script. 

Report here any problem, and I'll do my best to fix it.

---

**Have fun!**

There's recently been a great amount of bug/crash reports regarding Steam on /r/linux_gaming, which this subreddit is not intended for.

Please, if you want to report a bug or a crash, do it on the Steam for Linux forums (http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions) **but first make sure the bug hasn't been reported already**.

~~Future Steam bug/crash reports will be removed from the subreddit, but if you want, we could create a *single* submission titled something like ""Steam Bug Reports"", in which you can post your bug/crash reports, so that others may help you.~~

Please discuss if you want future Steam bug/crash/support-related submissions to be removed from the subreddit or how you'd like it.

If you disagree completely with this, please let me know.

Best, PencilAbuser

**PROS**

&gt; A separation of subreddits would make it easier for both parts.

&gt; - People who need support can navigate to a single subreddit (etc. /r/steamforlinux) and find a bunch of (helpful) submissions.

&gt; - People who are only interested in gaming itself on Linux, will be able to find it all here (/r/linux_gaming).

**CONS**

&gt; I'm not in the beta yet, and a one-stop-shop for keeping up with how things are going is great.

With your votes in Greenlight the game can be available on Steam.,132,24,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1itsz6/we_listened_our_players_and_decided_to_release/,"Hello Linux Gamers,

We are a small indie game development studio called Anchora Games. Earlier this year we released our first game Forgotten Myths which is a free to play online trading card game.

A couple of weeks ago we received an email from one of our users regarding platform availability. In order to play Forgotten Myths CCG, he installed virtualbox with win xp on his Ubuntu 12.04, but the game didn't work with it. That's the point when we decided this game should run on every platform, and we released Forgotten Myths on Linux a few days back.

Today we submitted Forgotten Myths CCG to Steam Greenlight for two of reasons: Users will be able to receive game updates much more conveniently and the game can get more attention in a digital distribution platform available in PC, Mac and Linux.

* CPU: *Intel i5 2500k (3.3ghz)*
* GFX: *EVGA GTX 580*
* HD: *OCZ Vertex 2 SSD*
* MB: *MSI P67A-GD55*
* RAM: *8GB DDR3*
* Windows: *Windows 8 Pro (64 Bit) fully updated. (NVIDIA 306.97)*
* Linux: *Ubuntu 12.04 (32 bit, kernel: 3.5.0-18) fully updated. (NVIDIA 310.19)*

**Information**

I attempted to do these benchmarks on 12.10 (64 bit) but ran in to problems with it, unrelated to TF2/Steam. I decided to go with the 32 bit version of 12.04 and update it instead.
I also set the performance modes in nvidia-settings and the nvidia control panel from ""Adaptive"" to ""Full Performance"" as well as disabling vertical sync on both systems. All of the benchmarks were done as fairly as possible. This Windows 8 install is no more than 3 days old and the Ubuntu install is fresh. All processes or programs that load on boot
other than what is installed by each operating system by default were disabled.

I allowed each instance of Steam/TF2 an initial load before going in to the benchmarks and used the timedemo feature to benchmark the in-game FPS. This was on my community server running cp_dustbowl and it was 10vs10. I captured about a minute of game footage from first person perspectives as well as free look, flying in to the sky to get an overall battlefield view. 

I ran 3 rounds for every different benchmark I did also. For the start up benchmarks I allowed the game to load one time before starting the 3 actual tests. I began the stopwatch when the screen turned black after clicking ""Play"" and stopped the watch when the menu items loaded.

For screenshots of the settings I used for low/high click use these links: [low](http://i.imgur.com/AIujC.jpg?1) &amp; [high](http://i.imgur.com/aQemd.jpg?1).

For a video of a short MGE round I played click this link: [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJruzlYuWo0)

Ignore the FPS in that video. I used the startmovie feature of TF2 to export the demo to individual frames and then later compiled them in to a video. The actual FPS I get on that map and arena is between 800 - 1000 FPS.

I then ran a test to time from when I joined a server (connect &lt;ip address&gt;) in console to when the select a team screen loaded. I gave this an initial connection too, before running the 3 real tests.

**Final Thoughts**

It's incredible how good it runs on Linux. It runs significantly better on Linux than it does OSX (Mac). I am sure it can still be optimized further. One thing I noticed is that even though the framerate is high, there still feels to be some kind of display lag. It's not as bad or as annoying as screen tearing or micro stuttering, it's hard to explain. Hopefully they'll fix that. Another concern for linux converts will be to get your sensitivities sorted by making the switch. It's nearly on par with Windows performance now other than the quirk I mentioned above. I'm sure within a few months it will be on par or even outdo the performance you get on Windows.

But if you can't wait for that like me, try it out now!

First go to your Steam library. Right click on TF2, click properties &gt; betas &gt; steampipe. Now close.

If you have already installed TF2 you just have to launch it and it will convert the existing installation and download some additional files.

Once you launch TF2 for the first time after converting, you might not notice any improvements to loading time, so launch it again and you will.

I have a GTX 660, 8GB of ram, and an intel i5 3470 cpu.

I'm not running it on an SSD, so if you have an SSD it will be even faster for you!

Now, if you want to disable the startup video with the valve logo, just go into TF2 properties like I showed you before, and this time ""set launch options"".

Type ""-novid"" without quotes and press OK. Then exit out of properties.

If you want to install mods or cfg files such as autoexec.cfg I found this guide 
( http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3093197 )

It's pretty much the same for TF2 but instead of the 'dod' folder it would be 'tf'.

That's all, just thought it would be somewhat helpful and/or relevant.

A few months ago, we made a news thread on Reddit about our first game called QuantZ.  The Reddit community has helped us a lot when it came to improving the quality of the game by sending us comments and advice.  Multiple comments mentioned the possibility to play on Linux, and so we did it!

We are now looking for Linux users to test the game before its official release.  Your opinion and comments on this version would be gladly appreciated (both for the installation process and for the game itself).  You can find the files to try out the game in the following links:

*old links removed, please see below for the updated version*


Feel free to email me your comments to my colleague:
[klazla@gamerizon.com](mailto:klazla@gamerizon.com)

We also improved the mechanics of the action mode to make QuantZ more fun: you can have multiple explosion comets in the air at the same time, which makes it faster-paced and more exciting.

Thanks guys!

edit:  for people unfamiliar with the game, here's a [trailer on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kWgDt1W2ZQ).

**edit2 (Nov 10th 2009 5:34PM EST)**: Man page was updated and some sound bugs fixed.  The links below are to the up-to-date versions:

**edit3 (Nov 16th)** 

Sorry, links broken (due to too many people downloading, which is awesome).  Will be repaired tomorrow morning.

Also, we'll be looking into the sound support issues and a 64 bit version.  Thanks everyone for the interest!

**edit4 (Nov 16th 12:44PM EST)** Here are new links for the Beta 1.1.2 version.  64 bit version forthcoming (use the .tar.gz version for now if you have a 64 bit system and want to try the game):

&gt;Will there be MAC/Linux version?
&gt;Mac and Linux version will happen only in case we pass through the Greenlight process. It's not possible to port the games for these system without success on Greenlight.

and

&gt; What are the benefits for your project, if you get greenlit?
&gt;There are several advantages. Here is a short list of some of them:
&gt;- It's very likely that we can deal with Valve on getting our game to latest version of Source engine, or at least 2009 version. This would bring many advantages. We believe it could improve the visuals and some gameplay aspects of the game. Also, we would be able to make a port of the game for Linux and MAC.

*""Invalid App Config"" means the game has no executable defined for the Linux OS, despite the game listing Linux in its OS support list*

*""Missing Executable"" means the game binary or launcher is defined in the Steam CDR for this game, but when Steam tries to run it, the file does not exist - some or all of the game's files may be missing*

I'm testing on Ubuntu 12.10 AMD64, with FGLRX

Some games are in private beta, i.e. you need to right click on the game, click Properties, and under the Betas tab, subscribe to the beta version of the game. This will require a password (contact the developers for password access)

All games can now be clicked in the above list to install them, which should save you the fuss of finding them in your Steam client.",STEAM,False,,t5_2r2u0,1358210843.0,steam,,True,t3_15502w,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/15502w/the_big_updated_list_of_which_steam_for_linux/,

&gt;Reposted: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/2545

&gt;On Linux, command line arg of all running processes are by default visible to all users, so using -login param will definitely risk your username and password details being exposed to everyone on the OS.

&gt;I'd like to propose a new cmd param -auth which takes login credential from a file containing username/password on 2 lines, ala --auth-user-pass param in openvpn

&gt;Why file? Because users can encrypt and decrypt the file as needed and the credential won't appear in steam command line arg

The OP is basically talking about the -login param that lets you log into steam with the username and password that you supply as arg (steam -login $user $pass)",,False,,t5_2r2u0,False,,ubuntu,True,t3_1fn8vi,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1fn8vi/steam_linux_users_we_require_a_secure_form_of/,

Anyways, back then the game selection was pretty slim. I mean I was fine with playing TF2 in wine, and some of the open source quake 3 clones were pretty good when their communities were more active (my favorites being Alien Arena and Nexuiz), as well as there were some good proprietary games for Linux (UT2K4). However, for several years after that, nothing happened in the world of Linux gaming. Sure Wine kept getting better, but eventually you got bored and missed some of your Windows games. Then I remember in 2010 I believe, things started changing. I started seeing Linux ports of popular indie games. It was pretty surreal. I mean I was playing a native port of Braid through humble bundle at the time and the developers did an outstanding job (from what I understand though, Pulse Audio was a pain the ass to deal with back then though). Then humble bundles kept coming out, and people were excited. We actually had decent games for Linux from the Penumbra series to Amnesia to Zen Bound 2 and so on and so forth. Yeah sure there were some bugs, but Linux people dealt with them (Linux guys/gals tend to deal with bugs better than other OS gals/girls I've noticed). Gaming on Linux was improving, and fun was had by all. 

Then the arrival of Steam happened. Once again I felt like I was having a surreal experience. I didn't have to run Steam in wine but rather I could run it natively, and not only could I run it natively, but about a third of my Steam games were ready to install. For the first time I felt like I could I finally use Linux without the feeling that I was dependent on Windows for something (I still use MS Office to check for formatting issues between Libre Office and MS Office though). For instance, a few years ago Killing Floor came out and I played that so much before Vista crapped out. It was my favorite game at the time alongside TF2, and nowadays I can play it on my Linux laptop natively just as I would on the PC version.

Things are changing, and I like it. Mind you, there are still a lot of great open source games out there, but some of them like Xonotic don't have too active of a community. Super Tux Cart is still great imo though. There are also other great open source games I like to play in that I can't recall at the moment though.

So yeah, it's interesting to watch the evolution of Linux gaming.",,False,,t5_2r2u0,False,,cake,True,t3_186lup,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/186lup/things_are_changing_and_its_amazing_to_look_at/,

Normally when you're listening it puts everything as two arbitrary sources in front of you, when configured to headphones it just moves those sources to your ears.

HRTF, on the other hand, maps out the way that the human ear percieves sound, and filters everything accordingly. With it enabled, you can distinctly hear if something's in front of you, behind you, and how far away.

Sad thing is that I bought a $95 sound card to get this effect on Windows, and... well the built in option here pretty much sounds the same ._.

Aaaanyway, for those of you who want to enable it:

If /etc/openal/alsoft.conf does not exist, copy /etc/openal/alsoft.conf.example to it.

Find this line:

    #hrtf = false

Uncomment, and edit to:

    hrtf = true

Test out in your favorite 3d game :3 I would not, however, recommend Amnesia for the purpose ._.

Both systems have their pros and cons, so I will list what they are (afaik and imho):

**STEAM**

*Pros*

* Large gaming library that *might* be migrated to Linux OSes
* Lots of Triple A titles who might get ported
* Huge community and support
* Steam Sales
* Many of their games have achievements.
* Larger userbase, there for, mutliplayer games more active.
* Steam updater updates only the files that need to be updated.

*Cons*

* DRM
* Sluggish at times
* Lacking Linux games (some games that have been ported to linux are not showing up as SteamPlay, ala Trine)
* Their mutliplayer feature locks out those who might have got the game elsewhere.
* You don't own the game, you own a license (*should be subscribe*) to the game...

**Desura**

*Pros*

* Not inherently DRM (many games can even be downloaded without the client
* Open source client *Desurium*
* Lots of Linux games!
* Alpha-funding. It's like Greenlight on Steam only easier to get in.

*Cons*

* Getting some of those games take more advanced knowledge (*chmod +x game*)
* Not nearly as many Triple A titles
* Community is not as prevalent
*  Installing/updating multiple games simultaneously is likely to crash the Desura client.
* Updater downloads the whole package.

Now this is a list that I started off the top of my hat to start the conversation, but who do you think we should focus our love and adoration?

Edit: Think about this scenario...

A game you really want is on sale on both platforms, same cost, same game (no Steam specific special stuff). Who do you buy it from? 

Edit 2: More consideration from /u/sakuramboo. Added to above list

Edit 3: /u/gamedeveloper makes a good point. Added to Con for Desura

Edit 4: Forgot the biggest Steam Con. You don't own the game, you own a license to the game...

Edit 5: Some of you mention buying it from the developers. I think this is a great idea and I wish I would have put it in the title. So, I guess there is a third option I didnt think of. Sorry.

1344115168.0,68,self.linux_gaming,xopsk,New Linux Distro which may aid with Linux gaming,85,17,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/xopsk/new_linux_distro_which_may_aid_with_linux_gaming/,"I just released the first public release of my Linux distribution, Bedrock Linux.  It's a rather unique distribution which aims to make most of the (often seemingly mutually-exclusive) benefits of various other Linux distributions available simultaneously and transparently.  This means if a game works in one Linux distribution, it will almost certainly work in Bedrock Linux.  This is especially pertinent to those who were disappointed to hear that Valve will initially focus only on getting steam to work on Ubuntu.  You want to use, say, Arch Linux or Debian but still want to be 100% compatible with the Ubuntu-aimed new steam?  Bedrock Linux might just be the answer you're looking for.

Bedrock Linux's website can be found [here](http://bedrocklinux.org), and of course I created a /r/bedrocklinux.

This isn't for everyone, but someone in /r/linux correctedly pointed out to me that it could be especially useful for people who play videogames on Linux, as it solves common library issues, and so I am sharing it here.

EDIT:

It seems the explanation I gave above was quite poor.  I apologize, and I blame a lack of sleep due to excitement for finally releasing this project last night.  I will attempt to explain much better below:

What this does is (ab)use chroots, bind mounts and PATH manipulation to transparently allow you to run programs from just about any Linux distribution.  The programs will see the libraries they need (and will not conflict with libraries from other Linux distributions), but other files which you would like shared (such as /home) will be shared.  This way, if a particular program is problematic in the distro of your choice, but you know it works in another distro, you just set it to use that distro and it will just work.

For example, I've had issues running Quake Live in Debian as Debian's X11 was to old, but I've also had issues with running it in Arch as some of Arch's libraries were too new.  Using Bedrock Linux, I just picked a distro I knew QL worked in and ran it and it worked.  Transparently.

I primarily intended this for things which are not necessarily game specific.  For example:

With only a few days to go before presenting Compiz at a local Free/Open Source Software enthusiast club, I found Debian's video drivers for my laptop were overly old to support the 3D acceleration needed for Compiz. While Arch Linux's X11 video drivers were new enough, its Compiz package did not work at the time. Bedrock Linux allowed for a quick and easy solution: use Arch Linux's X11 with Debian's Compiz.  There really isn't a good way to have done this without Bedrock Linux.  Note that I didn't have to do anything special - I just installed xorg in Arch, compiz in Debian, put ""compiz"" in my .xinitrc and ran ""startx"".  It all feels like a single, cohesive Linux distribution.",,False,,t5_2r2u0,1352383877.0,,,True,t3_xopsk,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/xopsk/new_linux_distro_which_may_aid_with_linux_gaming/,

We managed a port for Monaco. Just with our +1 votes in the steamboards the developer recognized that their is a community worth it.

To make that clear, the payday developer didn't said anything about a linux port! There is just a thread on the steamboard and my goal is giving us a voice and maybe they recognize our interrest.

To clarify anything first, I am not a developer, only a beta tester for the Linux client at this moment. I will get into more detail on that soon.

Desurium is the community developed open source continuation of the previously closed source Desura client [Desura](http://www.desura.com/).

I discovered this client a couple of years ago and have noticed that the development for Desurium is currently lackluster and we need more developers.

Currently, the Desura store is 100% cross-platform, and has games available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Unfortunately, the latest Desura client is only currently available for Windows and Linux.

The in-development Desurium client outperforms the older Desura client on Linux. However it is only available to be compiled on Linux. The Windows version of Desurium is currently incomplete and needs more tinkering with.

A Mac client is on the roadmap, but has not started at the moment.

Windows and Mac developers are strongly encouraged to contribute to this project (additional Linux developers are always welcome too!) Desurium is licensed under the GPLv3, so you won't have to worry about any restrictions!

I'm here to recruit anybody who is interested in contributing to the development of Desura/Desurium, for more information, click the links below!

I'm posting here not to rant, but because I'm genuinely curious about the significance of Direct3D and why people stopped using OpenGL for it (after all, it'd be quite embarrassing to rant about something I'm clueless about). I know that older PC games had an OpenGL render option, but now it seems that developers have stopped doing so. OpenGL just seems like such a better option, because even if you're not initially going cross-platform, it'd be one less hurdle to manage if you decide to (even though there may be some remaining middleware issues depending on the game in question). Another example is the recent discussion on the Linux Game Cast, where they (rightfully so) ranted about the Skullgirls devs using proprietary Microsoft tools to build a game that had reached a Linux stretch goal. I've been thinking about it a lot, and I would like some insight from the Linux community as to why Direct3D has become the norm.

If the developer decides to deliver a Linux port, the funds are collected, similar to how kickstarter works. I suppose the difficulty would be in the details, but I was just wondering what you guys thought about the idea.

A scheme like this might allow a developer to get some additional incentive (i.e. money) to port older titles, and would allow us users, who may even already own the game on Steam for Windows, to show our support for a Linux port directly.

**Edit: Thanks for all the comments! So there seems to be two lines of thought, the first being my original proposal, along the lines of kickstarter where people pledge funds that are collected upon delivery of a port and the second being something a few people suggested, that is something along the lines of green light, where you can show your support for a port, but are not obligated to actually follow through with the purchase. I think I am leaning towards the latter, as it would be the simplest and least risky of the two options.**",,False,,t5_2r2u0,1369646967.0,,,True,t3_1f2fwz,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1f2fwz/i_had_an_idea_valve_could_implement_to_possibly/,

Given the clusterfuck that was giveaway #17, I've decided to make it all better by doing another (non-Steamgifts) one.

Today, I'm giving away ~~3~~ **4 copies of Cave Story** and ~~3~~ **4 copies of the Rochard DLC - Hard Times** (note: you'll need a copy of Rochard to play this).

How to enter:

All you have to do is have 10 posts (before 2nd March) on this subreddit, /r/linux4noobs, /r/linux, /r/linuxquestions or any of the distro specific subreddits (e.g. /r/ubuntu) except /r/android.  These must be viewable in your history.

You can go for both if you like, just reply to this post (don't message me!) with the ones you'd like to go for.

I'll choose the winners using random.org for both games and then PM them so I can get their Steam name to gift them.  Please note that if you win, I will have to add you (Footissimo on Steam) as a friend.  I can't get around that without using emails..and I'd prefer not to freak people by asking for email addresses!

Please note that this giveaway is for people who contribute to linux subreddits and use linux (at least as a dual-boot) and to say ""Thanks"" to the good people who make /r/linux_gaming a nice community, who help out others etc etc.  If you look like you're a freebie-hunter then don't be upset that if I chose someone else - there's plenty of people around who don't have huge steam libraries and may actually really appreciate these giveaways.

**This will end at midnight GMT on Sunday (19:00 EST Sunday)**

Edit:  As everyone is being so nice, I've added another copy of Rochard and Cave Story.  At the moment that means that the people who've entered so far have a 33% chance of getting Rochard DLC and 40% chance of getting Cave Story.

My system:

archlinux 64-bit with pure alsa (no pulseaudio)

GeForce GT 540M (optimus) and intel HD3000

What I have found out so far:

In general dependencies seem rather light on these, as they include libraries. You may need libtxc_dxtn.

- Bastion runs flawless on my system (with intel or nvidia graphics). There is also an update available (since 2012-06-02), check your links. I had to run the installer in ""unattended"" mode (`./Bastion-HIB-2012-05-29-2.sh --help` should give you the options) and you may want to use ""--target dir"" if you have too little ram to extract it.

- Limbo doesn't run in the ""linux"" version, using the windows version with wine works without problems.

- Psychonauts is really crashy, there is a patch available at bugzilla.icculus.org that fixes some, but not all issues.

- S&amp;S works without problems. `ldd` shows no particularly obscure dependencies, it is 32-bit, though. (curl and libgl are of note)

- I haven't tried amnesia yet (too scared)

Fixes:

#Bastion:

Download the updated version.

#Bastion crashes on input (moving mouse): 

&gt;The solution is to add this line &lt;dllmap os=""linux"" dll=""libXi"" target=""libXi.so.6""/&gt; to file 'OpenTK.dll.config'.

#Bastion resolutions:

Minimum resolution is 1024x768, lower resolutions may require deleting ""Profile1.profile"".

#Limbo:

Try the windows version with wine.

**07.06**: New ""linux version"" is out and this one actually _works_ with my intel card. Launching it with bumblebee still fails due to ""Missing Shader Model 3.0 Support"" or something equally silly.

#Limbo has no sound:

Install the 32-bit version of libpulse (lib32-libpulse in arch and libpulse0:i386 in ubuntu).

#Psychonauts:

Wait for icculus to get his ass in gear :-).

Watch the bugzilla at https://bugzilla.icculus.org/buglist.cgi?product=Psychonauts and try the patch at https://bugzilla.icculus.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5533#c2

**EDIT**: New  Psychonauts build is out on the humble store. Not sure if it is just the patch already posted (which doesn't fix everything) or something new. 

------

**07.06**: They just added Braid, Super Meat Boy and Lone Survivor (for those who paid over average).

Super Meat Boy is a brand new build (icculus did say he wanted to finish it sometime), Braid should work fairly well already, and Lone Survivor is a flash/air game.

I'm downloading them right now and will add info.

Lonesurvivor is distributed as a tarfile, which is fine, with a script that adds a menu item (but is optional).

It is a 32-bit build even on 64-bit systems, and requires 32-bit versions of some gnome-ish libraries (gtk2, pango) according to `ldd`. 

It runs in flash player which I can't figure out how to get to fullscreen mode. For a horror game like lone survivor this is _bad_.

Lackluster ""port"".

Braid is an Icculus port, the installer even allows to select the architecture which is a nice touch.

It ships most of its libraries (SDL etc) as usual.

It seems to work well (to be expected given it had some time to mature) but right now I'm looking to set the language to english (I hate to play games in german since the translation is usually bad).

Supermeatboy seems to run and install okay, I'm going to test a controller/gamepad on this.

One thing I did notice though is that the replay can sometimes be out of sync with the world (so it appears as if meatboy is walking through razorblades), I'm not sure if this is in the other versions as well.",,False,,t5_2r2u0,1339090647.0,,archlinux,True,t3_ukhmv,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/ukhmv/the_humble_bundle_v_help_thread/,

1373548589.0,55,self.linux_gaming,1i2t5y,MMORPG Wakfu now available on the Ubuntu Software Center and for your favorite linux distribution.,66,11,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1i2t5y/mmorpg_wakfu_now_available_on_the_ubuntu_software/,"Hi. 
I'm Ourson, software engineer at Ankama, a french based studio that you may know for the games [DOFUS](http://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg-free/dofus), [WAKFU](http://www.wakfu.com/en/mmorpg/game/presentation) , Fly'n or the epic animated serie also called Wakfu. 


We just released Wakfu on the Ubuntu software center, so you can install it by [clicking here](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/wakfu/) . Simple as that. 


But, you may have another distro. So here are some ready-to-play tarballs ( which are still a work in progress) for [64 bits](http://dl.ak.ankama.com/games/installers/wakfu-amd64.tar.gz) and [32 bits]( http://dl.ak.ankama.com/games/installers/wakfu-x86.tar.gz).


I do not have time to provide a native package for every single distro. 
But, if you do have the will, the skills and the time to maintain a package for your distro, you are awesome and, you are welcome to do it !


I've setup a [public mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ankama-linux-support) so you can follow and participate in the packaging efforts as a community.


Wakfu has always been somehow available on linux, but non-debian-based distro where kinda left behind. 
Hopefully, we improved that, both the game and the launcher ( which is brand new by the way ) should now run on most distros with minimal efforts. 


So please, tell us what you think of the game and those new packages. 
That whole move to publish WAKFU on ubuntu is kinda a personal initiative. 
I really think the winds are shifting and, it may not be the ""year of the linux desktop"" but, the linux gamers can't be ignore anymore.
 

What could we do to improve the experience ? What other of our games would you like to see on linux ?  If you do happen to be on Ubuntu, you can rate the application and that would really help us out.


Finally, there is an [animated trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRWDgzmyJWk) and a [gameplay trailer](https://vimeo.com/60108768)

And thanks to the Ubuntu ""MyApps"" team for making that possible.

    env EDITOR=vi ./dx9frames.sh yourusername

or:

    ./dx9frames.sh yourusername maxquality #Would recommend using one designed for dx9.

Afterwards, just copy the options it prints out, change them for your resolution, and follow the instructions.

1373140919.0,56,self.linux_gaming,1hriv7,"There are eighty bajillion ""fast-paced"" FPSes on Linux. How about some slow-paced ones?",76,20,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hriv7/there_are_eighty_bajillion_fastpaced_fpses_on/,"I'm really not into the kind of FPS that's 100% reflexes like Warsow or Sauerbraten. I'm looking for something that gives you time to think and plan. Preferably one that allows sneaky tactics like sniping and surprise attacks.

Some background (and ranting) **(this is the anti-TL;DR)**: What prompted me to post this was that I watched [this awesome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYXIILnohFE) of InTheLittlewood fighting Nerd^3 in Red Faction Guerilla. Believe it or not, I actually like how bullet spongy the characters seem in the video because it means that I won't die simply because I didn't see someone in time. This got me thinking ""why aren't there games like this for Linux?"" I'm assuming that there are but that I just don't know about them, but it sure seems like there aren't. Whenever I go to a webpage that's something like ""top 10 FPSes for Linux"" every fucking one of them almost fits this description to a T: ""a fast-paced arena-style shooter with complex bunny hopping maneuvers and a very steep learning curve based on a 16-year-old game engine"". It's gotten to the point where every time I see ""fast-paced"" used to describe an FPS I mentally groan and move on because I know it's just going to be the same game with slightly different weapons and maps.

Case in point: Alien Arena, Nexuiz, Warsow, Sauerbraten, Quake Live, OpenArena, AssaultCube, World of Padman, Red Eclipse.

\*wipes foam from mouth\* Does anybody know of a FPS that isn't all about who can hold down the left mouse button first? One that encourages strategy and thinking instead of 270^o FOVs and strafe jumping?

**EDIT:** I just gave Red Eclipse another look and it actually doesn't seem all that Warsow-y. I dismissed it too quickly, it seems. Might give it a go.

I actively took part in the Loki newsgroups back in the day, buying all the games they ever put out. I voted with my wallet and bought just about everything that ever came out for Linux from other developers, too.

Making graphics card drivers work was a nightmare when all I had was a voodoo1. Glide was an RPM nightmare on glide.xxedgexx.com; [instructions](http://www.lokigames.com/support/gldrivers/howto-3d-3dfx.html) included manually inserting kernel modules. I recall Quake not even running under an X server [back when runlevel3 was the default, because X couldn't be trusted to successfully launch on most hardware configurations. Configuring Xfree86 version 3 was an *adventure*]

Anyway. I realise this sounded like ""in my day we had to walk uphill to school both ways, in the snow"", which I didn't really mean. Nowadays, life is freaking great. I can't even afford to buy all the games that are available for Linux now. I have masses of Linux games, delivered through the premier distribution platform for games on *any* platform.

I know it's been a while since Brutal Doom first gained widespread attention, but a new version just came out this month! It took me the better part of my morning to get this working, so I decided to make this thread (and a reddit account).
For those of you unacquainted with Brutal Doom, the trailer: http://youtu.be/BTWP3wvAUuQ  
  
**Step 1: Install GZDoom**  
For those of us on Debian based distros (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.) we have some precompiled binaries from : http://debian.drdteam.org/  
    $ sudo apt-add-repository 'deb http://debian.drdteam.org/ stable multiverse'  
[Then download and import this gpg key] (http://debian.drdteam.org/drdteam.gpg)  
    $ sudo apt-get update  
    $ sudo apt-get install gzdoom  
Done. [Everyone else gets to deal with this mess](http://zdoom.org/wiki/Compile_ZDoom_on_Linux)  

**Step 2: Acquire .wad files**  
Which you of course have from owning Doom/Doom2/Doom Final and did not acquire through the reprehensible method of googling things like 'Doom1.wad', 'Doom2.wad', 'plutonia.wad', or 'tnt.wad'.
 
Rename all of these files *including their .wad extensions* to be entirely lowercase. Remember, Linux filepaths are case sensitive.  
  
**Step 3: Acquire Brutal Doom**  
Brutal Doom: http://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/downloads/brutal-doom-version-181  
Alternate Soundtrack (highly reccomended): http://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/downloads/doom-metal-soundtrack-mod-volume-3  
Go ahead and extract these.  
  
**Step 4: Assemble and Configure**  
Now take all those .wad and .pk3 files and dump them in your gzdoom folder (/usr/games/gzdoom). If you're one of those folks who hates mucking about outside of your home folder and doesn't care about other users playing this on your system, you can also dump them in your config folder (~/.config/gzdoom).  
Now you need to direct gzdoom to autoload these, [as it seems to have trouble doing that on Linux](http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=10988). Open up your zdoom.ini file (~/.config/gzdoom/zdoom.ini) and navigate to the ""[Global.Autoload]"" section. This is where you should be able to define your paths and enable brutal doom for all 4 games. For some reason, whatever I put there only applied to Doom2, so my zdoom.ini looks more like this: http://pastie.org/6232801  
You'll note that besides things like Path=/usr/games/gzdoom/brutalv018a.pk3 I've got some paths about lights and brightmaps. [Explanation.](http://zdoom.org/wiki/GZDoom#Dynamic_lights_and_brightmaps)  

I appreciate your attention and ask for corrections/ways I can improve this. Have fun, and please apologize to your significant others for me.

Like many Linux users, I have a multiple monitor setup. How a given game handles multiple monitors is all over the map. I have seen games that only run fullscreen on the leftmost monitor (which is awkward in my setup, as my leftmost monitor is in portrait mode), games that try and span both monitors (with odd results when the resolutions are different monitor to monitor), and games that run fullscreen on the rightmost monitor.

In some cases, (Like the Valve games) there's a setup option in-game that allows me to chose which monitor to display on, and how (fullscreen vs windowed) - that's the way to do it.

In some cases (like World of Goo) there is a text file config that can be edited to provide the same functionality. That's cool, but it is annoying to have to go look for it rather than having access to an in-game settings menu.

And in some cases (Leisure Suit Larry) there appears to be no way to override the game's display choice - which can be a deal breaker.

Bart K. here, from [OpenGameArt.org](http://opengameart.org).  As some of you may already be aware, OGA's purpose is to create and archive art and media for use FOSS video games.  We've been doing this since April of '09, and we've built up fine community and a good reputation.  We frequently do paid commissions of art and music for specific open source game projects, but thus far we've been unable to fund the creation of 3D art because it's so specific and expensive.

To be specific, here are [some](http://opengameart.org/content/the-awesome-possum-ultimate-smash-friends) [examples](http://opengameart.org/content/xeon-ultimate-smash-friends) [of](http://opengameart.org/content/sorlo-ultimate-smash-friends) 2D art that we've commissioned recently for a promising PyGame clone of Super Smash Bros called [Ultimate Smash Friends](http://usf.tuxfamily.org/wiki/Main_Page) that was in need of some graphics.  At the moment, we're in the process of funding a complete graphical overhaul for them.

To give you an idea of what art costs, those sprites were $150 each (which any professional pixel artist will tell you is a good deal).  We also do random art and music commissions for other games and more general ones for the community as a whole.

September was a fairly typical month.  We spent a total of $688 ($488 on commissions, $200 on hosting), and took in $168 in donations, which meant that *the $520 balance came out of my own pocket*.  I am not, for the record, particularly rich; I'm just an average software engineer with a wonderful and supportive wife. :)

We recently received a big sponsorship from [Gameboom](http://gameboom.com) (thanks guys!), who agreed to donate server space, freeing up another $200/month for commissions.

All that being said, we've never been able to commission 3D art because high-poly 3D art costs 5 to 10 times as mush as 2D art for the same thing (character models versus 2d sprites, etc), which means that we're less able to provide help to a lot of very deserving FOSS game projects.  We could afford maybe one 3D commission a month (if we get a good deal on it), but that would pretty much lock us out of sponsoring any other projects.

So, here's the deal.  It would be a huge help if we could get a large number of people to sign up for a very small monthly donor subscription (even $3 is awesome).  If you paid any amount of money to make the Humble Bundle (which was an excellent project that I approve of whole-heartedly) Free and Open Source, this is a chance to support a lot of other projects that are *already* open source and could really use some art.

Interested in helping?  Just click the Donate button on our [homepage](http://opengameart.org).  If you want to donate but hate PayPal, contact me and I can also accept money orders. :)

Remember, the Creative Commons doesn't go away, so any money you donate for art commissions will go toward creating something that's free to everyone, forever!

Peace,
Bart K.
http://opengameart.org

P.S.  I will continue to put a lot of money toward commissions myself, regardless of how much we bring in in donations.

P.P.S.  Can't donate at the moment?  An upvote would be appreciated. ;)",,False,,t5_2r2u0,True,,,True,t3_dwtei,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/dwtei/opengameartorg_needs_your_help_so_that_we_can/,

It is the best way that I have come across to integrate Steam based Wine games into the native Steam client. If you have a better way or can fix some of my issues, please let me know.

-Install Steam in a single bottle with a number of games installed. 

-Force steam into offline mode.
http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=16112412&amp;postcount=8

-Setup a shortcut link to the specific exe of the game you want to play (I use playonlinx for this).

-Place Wine shortcut to game on the desktop. (again, playonlinux has a simple click button for it on the main screen)

-Follow the guide below:
http://shanefagan.com/node/13

The only down side is the clicking the game once launches steam in offline mode. You are free to leave that version of steam running and any other games in the same bottle that require steam will launch on the first click. The only thing that bugs me is that I can't get rid of the duplicate offline steam icon in the system tray.

Bonus - You can also use steam grid icons to make the games look all nice in grid mode. Just right click the game in grid mode and click on ""Set Custom Image""

Also, if your shaders are whacked out in games (like Fallout), install a shader mod. I used to have a bug in FO:NV, where if you looked in certain directions, your shaders would stop working, and your HUD would disappear, so I installed a random shader mod, and it worked.

1347245367.0,46,self.linux_gaming,zmtyr,My experience so far switching to Linux,53,7,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/zmtyr/my_experience_so_far_switching_to_linux/,"I'm running Mint 13 Cinnamon.

**Background:**

A little background - I'm not the average computer user that wants to try Linux out, I'm a systems architect/admin. So I have plenty of experience with Linux already. That tips it a bit more in my favor of everything working nicely...

**Setup:**

i5 750, 16GB RAM, and an unlocked 6950 2GB. Unfortunately - and I spent quite a while on it - the ATi drivers were glitchy, they wouldn't install properly, and even after a manual install performance in games was poor (ESPECIALLY in Wine) so I put my old GTX 460's back in (SLI). SLI proved to be pretty poor performance for Wine games, better for native games, but I play a couple Wine games a lot (SC2 and LoL) so I ended up disabling SLI.

**Performance:**

With the single GTX 460 1GB, it's not bad. LoL on med/high settings sits around 50FPS, SC2 unfortunately on medium runs at ~25 - as opposed to my GTX 460 SLI or 6950 in W7 being able to max it.

I'm thinking of selling both my GTX 460's and the 6950, and buying a GTX 680 or 670 instead.

**Game availability:**

I have bought a few humble indie bundies, so I've been able to delve into Braid/Limbo/Bastion etc. and they're GREAT. They run great.

So far PlayOnLinux/Wine have been great. I haven't run into a game that I want to play that won't run yet.

**Work:**

As I said I'm a systems architect/admin, I also do web development on the side for extra cash, and some light Python programming for a few firms who want very specific applications to handle certain calculations that aren't available on the market. I can test applications on one of my other boxes here or in a W7/XP VM.

So far I REALLY REALLY prefer Linux for this. The workspaces alone - oh man. I have three monitors, but with the workspaces I end up using just one and leaving a TV show on another and Reddit on the third. I could easily condense down, or sell my three 27"" 1920x1200 and trade them in for a nice Dell 30"". (A side note on workspaces - it's so much nicer than alt-tabbing out of a game!)

I'm already familiar with the command line, so everything is so much faster using that.

**Everything else:**

Booting up is faster (main partition on a SSD, home directory on another drive) and I'm very happy. Browsing the web is pretty much the same. I'm setting up Mutt to handle my handful of email accounts, and I like it much more than Outlook (most people would not agree with me here).

Tunneling into work is great. I VPN in, and have direct access to everything. Seems smoother than in W7.

**Problems:**

ATi drivers were a nightmare. =/ I'd rather be running my more powerful 6950, but oh well. Games are still good enough to play, and I work more than I play nowadays anyway.

Steam is a bit of a pain to configure - so far the few games I want to play have separate Steam logins through PlayOnLinux, so I have to exit Steam and restart it for whatever specific game I'd like to play. I'm sure there's a solution for this, but right now it's not a big deal since I really only play CS:S on Steam - and casually at that.

* * * * * * * 

Not the greatest writeup, but there are success stories. I've dabbled with swapping to Linux every now and again, but I end up going back to Windows 7 for some reason or another. It seems like everything is in alignment now, and I can do everything I want to on Linux.

Then when I switched to Linux, I pretty much stopped playing Windows titles. Every time I tried WINE with something, it either didn't work, introduced gameplay destroying bugs, or couldn't even install, so I stuck with native only games.

So, for me, even though many of the titles Valve is releasing are rather old, they are all new to me. Having finally played HL, HL:OF, HL:BS, and Portal, I can finally see what I have been missing.

I'm the dev behind a 3D space game called Salvation Prophecy.  I've been getting my linux groove on, working on a linux port, and things are far enough along to start talking about it.

Salvation Prophecy a military space epic.  It is single player.  It combines space sim battles, planet battles, and military command.  So you can fly your ship around, take part in big space battles, and land on planets too.  You work your way up in ranks by completing missions until you command your entire faction's battle strategy.  It's set against the backdrop of a futuristic war between humans, mutants, and robotic races battling for galactic domination, with an interstellar species of hostile aliens peering out of the murky depths of space.

I'm building it on ubuntu, but plan on testing on as many other distros as I can, once I finish the installer.  I'm planning to use the same installer as many of the Humble Indie Bundle games use - nixstaller.  (Opinions on that welcome!)

Long story short - I couldn't make Brutal Legend or Shank to recognize any of my gamepads.
Today I found out that xboxdrv can work on top of ANY joystick/gamepad using evdev.
So with this simple mapping I have xboxdrv create another gamepad which mimics xbox360 controller using xpad driver and works out-of-the-box in both Shank and Brutal Legend (and should with others too):

&gt;xboxdrv --evdev /dev/input/event15 --evdev-absmap ABS_X=x1,ABS_Y=y1,ABS_RZ=x2,ABS_Z=y2,ABS_HAT0X=dpad_x,ABS_HAT0Y=dpad_y --axismap -Y1=Y1,-Y2=Y2 --evdev-keymap BTN_TOP=x,BTN_TRIGGER=y,BTN_THUMB2=a,BTN_THUMB=b,BTN_BASE3=back,BTN_BASE4=start,BTN_BASE=lb,BTN_BASE2=rb,BTN_TOP2=lt,BTN_PINKIE=rt,BTN_BASE5=tl,BTN_BASE6=tr --mimic-xpad --silent

/dev/input/event15 should point to correct event device of your gamepad. This is the mapping for PS2 controller adapter. You can adjust it by removing --silent and adding --evdev-debug to output evdev codes for pressed buttons/axes

I also managed to fully simulate xbox360 controller for wine games but thats out of scope of this subbreddit.


edit:
You can also setup mapping for SDL2 gamepad API using Steam Big Picture mode. That'll work for Steam games only though (those using SDL2 library).

While many AAA games loaded with windows based middleware are a long way away from linux ports, there are a number of games that run fine on linux natively,  available for purchase on steam, but only the windows (and sometimes mac) versions are available. In [this article](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/12/steam-linux-to-launch-open-beta-next-week) Valve is reportedly asking developers to submit their linux system requirements. I may be going out on a limb here, but I assume that means it's more the responsibility of the developers and/or publishers to provide linux versions of their games to valve than it is valve's. Perhaps we should start contacting developers of known working linux games requesting they get their ports sent over. There are probably a lot more games that already have linux ports available than you think too. On top of just about every humble indie bundle title, there are older games like Doom I &amp; II, Unreal Tournament 2004 that work great under linux. Binding of Isaac and Samorost II work under linux because they're built on flash, I bet there are a number of lesser known titles built similarly that could be easily converted to linux too.

I installed Desura anyways as soon as it came out for Linux and I soon realized that you could log in offline mode and, better yet, there was a terminal. I spent a few minutes toying in the Desura console and came up with this. Maybe some minds greater than me can figure out how to unlock more goodies. Not all of these steps may be neccesary, but I figure it can't hurt.

1. Download the linux Desura client from [desura.com](http://desura.com/) and install it. If you're using Arch Linux you can install it [from the AUR](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=52511).

2. Start it up, let it update, and click ""Offline Mode"".

3. Click the little blue Desura logo at the top left, then click ""Console"".

4. Type the following commands:

    ""gc_linux_disable_windows_warning true""

    ""gc_beta 1""

5. Now we get to adding games. I'll use Minecraft as an example here. You're going to need to create a quick shell script to execute your game. (A lot of Linux games already come with one, but Minecraft doesn't. If your game already has a .sh file to start it, you can skip over to step 8.) Open up your favorite text editor and create a file in ~/.minecraft named ""minecraft.sh"". 

6. Type this in the file and save it:

    \#!/bin/sh

    java -jar ~/.minecraft/bin/minecraft.jar

7. Get into a terminal and use chmod to make your new script executable:

    sudo chmod a+x ~/.minecraft/minecraft.sh

8. Get back to the Desura console. Type in this command:

    gc_link_add [NAME OF GAME] [PATH TO .SH FILE] none

    So for our Minecraft example we would do:

    gc_link_add Minecraft /home/[USERNAME]/.minecraft/minecraft.sh none

9. Select your game from your Desura games list and start playing! You may have some trouble starting Desura after you quit the game. If this happens, a quick ""killall desura"" in the terminal should fix things up.

Hope this helped for those of us who want to get an early head start.",,False,,t5_2r2u0,False,,,True,t3_kqth6,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/kqth6/howto_use_the_desura_beta_client_to_addmanageplay/,

If you haven't tried to utilize your Optimus GPU on Linux before or you aren't sure how to, these guides are for you.

* [Arch](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bumblebee)
* [Debian](http://wiki.debian.org/Bumblebee)
* [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bumblebee)
* [Ubuntu](http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee)

**II. Make Steam Use The Correct GPU**


If you are using Optimus, than you have both an integrated Intel GPU and a dedicated Nvidia GPU.  By default, Steam will only recognize your Intel GPU, and every game you execute in Steam will follow suit.  There are two ways to make this work.  Neither solution is difficult, but one is much less efficient.

&amp;nbsp;

**A.** The Proper Solution.

This solution is the best and it's supported by Valve.  Do yourself a favor and do it this way.

Step 1. Open Steam

Step 2. Open your Steam Library

Step 3. Right click on the game that requires your Nvidia GPU

Step 4. Click Properties

Step 5. Click the General tab

Step 6. Click SET LAUNCH OPTIONS...

Step 7. Insert the following text and click OK:

    optirun --bridge primus %command%

Step 8. Close the Properties window and start your game!

&amp;nbsp;

**B.** The Quick But Inefficient Solution

The reason this approach is inefficient is because it will cause your GPU to constantly run, which will heat up your computer and cause heavy energy usage.  This approach is simply not recommended.  Having said that, enter the following command into your terminal.

    primusrun steam &amp;

I myself was quite disappointed with the fact that I had to install 14 packages from repos and 21 packages from AUR, which means by the way compiling from source things like js185 or wayland, taking lots of time and patience. 

So, after some dependency hacking I've managed to drastically decrease number of dependencies needed to run Gmod. I ended up with slightly modified PKGBUILD for lib32-gconf, so that it does not require so many deps while offering ability to run the game.


**Details**:

The hack basically consists of  two parts:

* replacing lib32-gtk3(which requires it and a dozen of its deps built from source) with lib32-gtk2(which is in multilib)

* compiling lib32-gconf without polkit support(lib32-polkit requires around dozen AUR packages)

**WARNING**:

Building lib32-gconf with this PKGBUILD, you'll loose some of normal gconf functionality. However the fact that you need to install 32-bit gconf only to play Garry's mod probably means you wouldn't be needing that anyway.

**Additional hint**: if you don't use any software that uses GTK3(which IMO is bloated and comes with tons of unnecessary stuff), you might want to install gconf-gtk2(which provides gconf, needed by lib32-gconf) from AUR instead of normal gconf(built with gtk3) from extra to avoid pulling lots of unneeded deps.

So please test to see if it really helps. It would be great if it does.

Just wanted to let you know we recently ported [Soda Drinker Pro](http://sodadrinkerpro.com/) to Linux, you can get it free in two ways.

1. Just head over to SodaDrinkerpro.com and pop in your e-mail in the download page and it will be sent to you immediately

2. Follow [this link](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3VwG2HXqnPBdmpRZEdfZUN5Zms/edit?usp=sharing) to a shared Google Doc for those of you who don't want to give your e-mail address

(I recommend doing it via e-mail though just because we have some really neat updates related to the Soda Drinking simulation world coming out in the next few months so if you want to stay updated on it that's the way to to)

Hope you enjoy drinking simulated Sodas on this lovely Sunday afternoon!

if you really really like drinking simulated Sodas too you can always vote for it on Greenlight [Here](http://sodadrinkerpro.com/greenlight/) too.

Happy Soda Drinking!

I am happy to report that it is quite possible to use a game controller with SOME Steam Games, espeically a 64-bit system like I have set up.  So far, I've managed to get my [Logitech Cordless RumblePad 2](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Cordless-Rumblepad-Vibration-Feedback/dp/B0002XJBGE) working with games like *Puddle*.  (I have a resolved thread for [setting up a controller on Linux](http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/19ttcn/looking_for_a_program_or_drivers_to_set_up_a_game/) in /r/linuxquestions.)

But *Puddle* doesn't take full advantage of the 11 or so buttons or the three controller pads that a game like *Half-Life* or *Team Fortress 2* could.  And My left hand would really like to meet the right hand on a game controller rather than playing Finger Twister with the keyboard.

So this is a call to all Valve fans, who may have seen the prototype pictures of the Steam Box with a [Logitech Gamepad F310](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-940-000110-Gamepad-F310/dp/B003VAHYQY) and would really like to use a game pad on their computer rather than a console machine.

Another thing that would be nice to have would be to see *Portal* come to Steam for Linux.  There are probably a million or so threads about this, but seeing as how I snagged a copy of it when they were giving it away for free for Windows and Mac back when I was using Windows, it seems logical that Linux users have a chance to play this game. In fact, the whole reason I signed up for Steam was so that I could play *Portal*.  But given how Valve just went through a round of layoffs including the lovely Jeri Ellsworth, and the entire Video Game and VFX industry is going through a financial crunch while Hollywood and Silicon Valley write corporate executives big bonus checks, putting *Portal* on Linux doesn't seem likely at this present time. 

(Perhaps it's my raging liberalism, but isn't it about time us computer programmers and hardware geeks unionize? We're probably one of the few industries that hasn't committed to it. I mean, what are they going to do: Outsource our jobs?)

Finally, a few bugs that I've noticed.  Maybe it's just me. Maybe it's the video card or the LCD screen I'm using but on a couple instances the HDMI connection to my computer crapped out (Completely blank screen! The Screen is fine but the connection just up and dies.) or it forgets my screen settings completely and goes from 1920x1080 to 800x600 where I have to run `xrandr` to get it back to normal.  I'm thinking these issues have nothing to do with Steam but it is strange for them to happen.

Anyway, those are my thoughts.",STEAM,False,,t5_2r2u0,False,steam,,True,t3_19z64o,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/19z64o/steam_wishlist_joystick_control_for_halflife_and/,

Personally, I've tested both Counter-Strike: Source and Team Fortress 2 on two computers, both using the Unity DE:

**Gateway laptop (i7 2670QM 2.20 GHz and GT 540m (Optimus), 8GB RAM):**

Team Fortress 2: Between 40-60 FPS Average (can dip into the 30s during combat, had to disable Multicore Rendering to avoid stuttering and this can occasionally ruin framerates)

Counter-Strike Source: Between 80-100 FPS Average (usually dips into the 60s during combat, for the same reason above)

**Desktop (AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 6000+ @ 3.00 GHz, Nvidia GT 520, 2GB RAM):**

Team Fortress 2: Stays steady at 30 FPS, can reach the 40s when in the spawn. Entering water brings it down to the mid-low 20s because of the full-screen shader effect. Still had to disable Multicore Rendering.

Counter-Strike Source: Stays steady at 40 FPS, no real dips or rises. Once again, no Multicore blah-blah-blah.

Both games on both computers were tested at max settings at 1920x1080 resolution (1366x768 for the laptop).


So, how has performance been for anyone else? Just curious as I haven't seen that many results from that broad a range of people. Just list basic information, no super specific decimal results are really necessary as long as you've monitored your ""cl_showfps 2"" values and can remember them.

EDIT: Forgot to mention I was using the 313.18 drivers on both systems.

What saddened me was knowing this great, somewhat underappreciated game was ""locked"" to the original XBox, PS2 and Windows PC, and since 2 of those platforms aren't manufactured anymore, the amount of people who can enjoy the game is limited even more.

It occurred to me, that if the engine were open sourced, the game could be ported, gain a new lease of life and be enjoyed by a whole new audience. In fact, not just The Suffering, but other games that used the Riot Engine (Drakan).

It occurs to me that there are a lot of games like this, good quality, fun, underrated, and based on technologies that are no longer worth protecting, but still rigidly locked to a given set of platforms.

I guess Steam's Workshop infrastructure might be able to handle this, or otherwise each game would need a community ""maintainer"" to create a separate Steam ""mod"" that runs on Linux but requires the Windows game as a base.

If it had to be a Steam ""app"" with its own entry, everything would need to be voted on via Greenlight, or sanctioned by the game publisher, which would be a nuisance to say the least.

Especially given the Steam Hardware Survey data isn't terribly detailed.

After subscribing to /r/dataisbeautiful[1] I felt inspired to create a small survey for Linux users. Most of it is fairly hardware-orientated - it would be really interesting to see the range of systems people are running Linux on!

Short of the surveys carried out on rainy Geography trips many years ago, I've never done this kind of thing before - so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

The survey is quite short and should only take a couple of minutes. None of the questions are compulsory, but of course it would be great if you filled them all out!

I'm not sure if this'll see the light of day, but if it does I'll try and collect data for a good few days, and see about presenting the results nicely afterwards.

Thanks all!

Opinions Needed.,42,9,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1de47e/fuse_linux_and_gaming_opinions_needed/,"Hey there, my name's Pedro Mateus and, for those of you who don't know me, I used to be part of the Fuduntu Support and (later) Communications team.
With Fuduntu officially dead in the water, some of us members of the old team have decided to move on to greener pastures... and by green I mean openSUSE green.

This is where it gets tricky. Fuduntu was always great for gaming (imo). While I do have a basic grasp of what a distro needs to be considered a good gaming OS, I decided to open the issue to everyone's favorite subreddit and hear your opinions on this.

What I want to know is: What does a distro need to be perfect for our medium?

This includes but is not limited to:

 * Desktop Environment - I'm talking raw OpenGL performance here.

 * Specific Software/Libraries/Firmware/Drivers - that need to be included/kept up-to-date

*ADDENDUM: The distro's name may or may not be changed, it's currently going through the legal motions. If you're feeling particularly preachy about it, take it up to SUSE/openSUSE.*",,False,,t5_2r2u0,1367297072.0,,cake,True,t3_1de47e,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1de47e/fuse_linux_and_gaming_opinions_needed/,
