Though we never got around to developing the project any further, I would often find myself going back and visualizing a scene in my head, so a couple of weeks ago I figured it was about time I got that image out of there so I can move on.  


The vast majority of the image was painted using Sketchbook Pro on my tablet PC (the kind where you draw directly on the screen), with maybe 15% being painted in Photoshop using a Wacom tablet.  Time to completion was roughly 20-30 hours.  Optimal viewing size is 20x30 inches.

1353183495.0,22,self.Illustration,13d5j5,Hello. I'm an Illustration major at MIAD. I'm here to raise some points.,28,6,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Illustration/comments/13d5j5/hello_im_an_illustration_major_at_miad_im_here_to/,"I slept 3 hours in the last 3 days. Something was just eating me up. I read a couple of books this morning, and I finally put my finger on it:

I just swallowed so much literature mourning the loss of Illustration as a valid form of art that I should, by all intents and purposes, be feeling like I've made the wrong career choice. But then I realized that these are the thoughts of aging men at a time when the tools available to us today were still evolving. This was 12 years ago. In the internet age, that's a thousand years' worth of cognitive evolution. I'm talking about digital media here. But I don't need to preach to you about its uses. We all use it, some of us even abuse it. I'm just baffled by this general idea that Illustration doesn't have a place in a world of designers and fine artists. We are seen as the middle children of a big divided family that has never and will never spare us the fucking time of day to hear what we have to say, and you know what? I say that's utter bullshit. Not because it's true but precisely because it isn't. I can't fucking spit with some of that spray hitting some form of illustrative representation somewhere. Sure, the outlets have grown smaller in some cases. Sure, magazines like the New Yorker are the golden ground upon which our gods once trod upon, and in an age where print media is dwindling, even those holiest of temples are becoming scarce to us. And so fucking what?
I'm not concerned about our place in the industry. It will always be there, and need us just as much as we need them. What concerns me is how our generation might, can, and will evolve as artists. Because that is what we are. We may not be trying to spearhead the next movement, our main concern may not be the avant-garde of artistic evolution, and the ""finer"" conceptuality of ""quality"" art may not be our driving force, but I'll be fucking damned if I sit down 25 years from now to look back at my career and the only thing I've got to show for it is a portfolio of work some pompous sack of shit will look upon and shirk for the nature of its conception.
Rockwell is an american icon, but he only became so when they called his work ""fine"" art. Even a virtuoso like James Jean has had to relabel himself. Re-brand. Because it doesn't matter if their art is good, what matters is if it's ""fine.""
Fuck. That. Noise.
Art is art, good is good, and we have the chance to show the remnants of the old school that it really doesn't matter where the art came from or what its purpose is, as long as its execution is effective and its concepts well represented, it will have achieved its goal, be that to illustrate a book or to bring to bear a high end concept. It's on us, all of us, illustrator, designer, painter, drawer, sculptor, printmaker, to show these pricks that their ideas are obsolete, that their ideologies are about to be dealt their final blow.

The point I'm trying to make is, I've been going through the motions and I have done myself and the industry at large a goddamned disservice. I need to get my shit in gear, and so should we all.

And my query is whether or not, as a student of Illustration, I'm the only one who thinks this way. Your thoughts, folks?",,False,,t5_2qh79,False,,,True,t3_13d5j5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Illustration/comments/13d5j5/hello_im_an_illustration_major_at_miad_im_here_to/,

Google Henri Privat-Livemont and Art Deco posters to get an idea of the two ends of the era and style we are looking at. 

Preference is for vector art, but I will consider photoshop/raster if necessary as long as its layered files. Final art could be as big as A1 or even A0. 

This will be for marketing a business, so please only respond if you know you can nail something like this (I know I can't!!) - similar folio pieces would be beneficial. Feel free to PM me with your details/folio/costs or further questions.

I'd love some opinions on a few Wacom Cintiq questions that simple searching on reddit didn't provide answers to.  Hopefully inquiring here will help me and others with similar questions.

Quick background about myself:  I've been a musician and casual illustrator my whole life (27yo now).  Four or so years ago I decided to pursue illustration as a daily hobby and potential career change (if by chance I turned out to be far above average).  I bought an Intuos3 and dove into digital painting.  I was upset with my progress so a professor persuaded me to master drawing to improve my painting skills.  So I've spent my time with pencil and paper.  I've grown to love the feel of hovering over a piece of paper for hours.  So much so that using a tablet/monitor is a great disconnect.  

My research lead me to the Cintiq... Monitor/tablet that you can hover over like a piece of paper.  The price tag of $2000+ scared me at first... but I've been giving it some serious thought.  I could put aside a few hundred every month and in a year make the plunge.

Most reviews I've read say that the 24inch model ($2000+) is the way to go... I use a 24inch monitor on my computer and would be upset with anything smaller.

I've searched and called around my county and found no vendors... so traveling 100 miles for a hands on experience will have to wait.

If you're an illustrator and/or have experience with Cintiqs, could you please answer with your opinions.  I would love a Professional vs Hobbyist mix.

* Does anyone have experience with the different model sizes? pros and cons?

* What are the ergonomic similarities/differences between pen&amp;paper and pen&amp;cintiq?

* Intuos vs Cintiq?

* Does your hand being in the way cause any difficulties with the Cintiq?

Any help would be great!  It will take me awhile to save up, so my opinion has time to fester.  Feel free to PM if you don't feel like commenting.

We'd like to have a bunch of illustrations, mostly chapter headings and 3-4 pictures per chapter. We're looking for black-and-white and a creepy-but-fun style. Check out [Zombie Chasers](http://www.amazon.com/Zombie-Chasers-John-Kloepfer/dp/0061853062/) as an example of what we're thinking about as far as humor and number of illustrations.

Right now I'm looking for some ideas as to what a pro would charge to illustrate this book. I'm pretty ignorant about what's involved, but my guess is:

* character design for main characters
* a total of, say, 50 illustrations. A cartoonish style is fine.

I'd like to hear what you all think would be a reasonable total cost for the project. I'd expect a big range based on skills and experience, but I'm curious what that range would be. Also, I'd love to learn what else I should know or think about as a potential client. 

Just to be clear, we're not close to pulling the trigger on this project - this is just an info-gathering request.

Thanks for any information or thoughts - I really appreciate it.

I've always drawn and such, but there was a certain year I started taking it seriously and went out of my way to do anything I could to improve. I've had some commissions, I've sold most of my new paintings, I have my own website and I'm recently starting to advertise myself. Aside from posting classifieds, which ultimately lead me to average people thinking they can pay me $10 for a portrait of their baby, I made a work-in-progress type blog to generate some interest in my work.

You make the art, post it wherever you want (tumblr, deviantart, imgur, your fridge, etc) but send us a link/picture!
We'll start on March 1st, and end on March 30th.

Best of luck to all, I hope for solid participation through all 30 days! I don't want to feel silly, making threads on day 14-30 for just me!

Questions:

**Undergraduate Programs?**

I heard of BPMI (Biomedical and Pre-Medical Illustration), Biomedical Communication (BMC) and then there are programs that offer certificates. I'm just confused and a little scared that what I choose is gonna be far from helping my situation.

**Do you have to have a Master's Degree in order to find a job?**

I posted a few weeks back about starting out and the advice was good which I appreciate. I'm slowly making progress, I've got a sketchpad and I'm beginning to doodle.

I have a few questions though that I would appreciate answers for if you could:

- Should I be looking at another illustrators work to pick up a style I like? I've just been drawing and I haven't really done anything illustration wise, just trying to copy real life items really.

- If so, where can I find other illustration works?

- Is graphic design the same as illustration?

- How do I create a link between drawing and the computer? Can I draw something on paper and scan it in to photoshop or would it be worth getting a tablet?

- Are tablets harder to use then just a standard pencil and piece of paper?

- I noticed this guy's work in /r/Art and I was wondering whether this is classed as illustration or something else, could you perhaps clarify it for me? http://www.fengzhudesign.com/

I have a bit of free time and I'm looking to find an illustrator that would like to collaborate on some iPhone apps.

As an example of what I've done you can check out 'Fridge Pal'.  www.fridgepalapp.com.  It's a shopping list / expiry date tracker / recipe app.  Key features are dropbox integration, cloud sync and data server, barcode scanner to enter items and in app purchase for upgrades.  I've built a bit of technology that I can reuse to make another app fairly quickly.

I have the programming side of things down so looking for someone who can handle the design / illustration side.  I'd like to model after what tapbots guys did which was a team of 2, 1 programmer and 1 designer, making simple apps but which had nice art and a fairly clever / intuitive interface.

Collaboration and compromise are really important to me.  I would very much like to find someone that I can brainstorm with and who is interested in working as a team. 

I have an app called 'pocket band' which I haven't really done much with.  Was kind of thinking of resurrecting that - it was meant to be a punk-o-matic clone.  Also very interested in just working on whatever.  I'd really like to work on something that can be done quickly - maybe in a month or two.  I work as a contractor so if we get along hoping to also be able to get paid contracts and possibly collaborate on those as well.

I'm in my junior year of college, pursuing my illustration degree. Everything was going smoothly up until this past semester. I've become increasingly worried about what to do with my skills after college. So after taking an anatomical modeling class, I started researching medical illustration- I became fascinated with the field, yet it's very intimidating. I learned that there are very few schools (exactly 5 in North America) that offer a graduate degree in Med. Illustration, one of them being University of Illinois in Chicago (currently where I live). I get very excited about the topic, I've always loved drawing the human figure, especially bones and muscles. [here's](http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/5696_1200452969843_1184104521_30614860_7615797_n.jpg) an uncompleted painting I did when I was 17 (just to show previous attempts)- my skills have improved quite a bit since then, I'm 21 now.

Anyway, I guess what I'm asking is- has anyone ever dabbled in this field/done medical illustration? Of course the graduate program requires a lot of medial classes, as well as technical art classes- but they emphasize that is is ""tailored"" for creative minds. I think I read that about 30 students apply, and half of them are accepted.

Didn't matter what it was, or even if it turned out any good, but I wanted to challenge myself creatively in some way. Something just sort of clicked, and I want to further explore how far I can go with this. The next step I was thinking about taking was investing in a tablet so I can try my hand at digital illustration, but my worry is that it might be a waste of money. 

All of my illustrations have been done on paper with pens and watercolor. I have more control with pens, I just like the FEEL of paper, and having my eyes a millimeter away from the page so I can get every single detail. My worry is I will lose that if I were to get a tablet. I have an iPad and fooled around with that a little and it was horrible. I'm sure iPads are more primitive in terms of sensitivity to Wacoms, for example, but the whole lot intimidates me. I was wondering if there are people in this subreddit who started out like me and made the jump, and if they would be willing to share their experiences. 

I don't have a scanner. Currently what I have to do to upload my images onto my computer is hover over my sketchbook with my phone, email the image to myself and edit that in photoshop. [Here's a sample of my work.](http://imgur.com/a/xSS7t) It's not my best, but it's some of the only ones that I've 'uploaded' to my computer. 

**TL;DR** Scared to buy a tablet because I've always just used a sketchbook. Wondering how hard the jump is and if people could share their stories.

I don't mind doing digital illustrations for free or donations.  Art is more of a hobby for myself and I have another regular full time job that actually covers most of the bills.  So, a pay-what-you-want deal would suit me fine and allow someone to get some art for a relatively cheap price.  The only drawback for the customer is that I can be a bit picky about what I decided to draw.  So, I can't guarantee that I'd draw every request.

I'm currently working on a commission for a new company, and had some questions. Here are the details..

* first freelance job. A student at an art college. 
* was requested for this job through the college's job site.
* the company is starting out, new, and is run by two people. Met with only one of them at the information meeting last week. 
* have to design two logos, and have it done by the end of the week. The sooner, the better. 
* the person I met with said I can name my own price. 
* was given simple guidelines of the 'feel' of the logos, but have artistic freedom (the person loves my illustration style)
* they said that others in their field may need logos or designs in the future, and they would give me a good word. 
* the two logos can be all that I do, and if I want to do more, they'll give me more design tasks for the company.
* they said they will credit me on their website, however, their website isn't up yet from what I can see.

So, with that information, my question was: what should my price for them be? Is this opportunity legitimate, or does it seem fishy? I'm still a fledgeling when it comes to pricing and if the company is legit, so hopefully you guys can help.",,False,,t5_2qh79,False,,,True,t3_10d8s7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Illustration/comments/10d8s7/hey_rillustration_i_have_a_question_regarding_a/,

The question is... how do I do that?? 

I have a [tumblr blog](http://debbiefong.tumblr.com) with about 700 followers and I will occasionally promote my [Etsy shop](http://www.etsy.com/shop/debbiefong) there, but it doesn't seem to garner much attention when I mention that I'm selling stuff.

I am a screenwriter based out of Toronto, Ontario. I am in the initial stages of my career, but have an agent and a little bit of experience - I wrote a low budget sketch show for tv, and am currently working on a feature script for a production company in the US. 

My writing partner and I recently wrote (on spec) a pilot for an animated kids' show. Sometime this year, we will be going around to production companies to try and pitch it, and as part of our pitch package, we were hoping to include some concept art. I'm sure that once we have a production company involved, that they'll already have a relationship with an animation house, but we'd like to have some art to pique the production companies' interest before that.

So, as a relatively new writer, I have some questions about this:

* Do illustrators ever work on option agreements? This is a very common agreement between producers and writers regarding a script, and I'm wondering if it can be applied to a writer-illustrator relationship. Basically, the writer would pay a nominal fee, $X, to have the right to (exclusively) use the illustrator's drawings in the pitch package for one year. At the end of that year, the writer could either purchase the drawings outright for $Y and own the copyright, or could extend the agreement for another year (for another option fee of $X), or the agreement will end and all rights revert to the illustrator. Is that a common practice at all?

* If that is a possibility, what would the amounts above, X and Y, be? Let's assume that I would want a drawing of 3 different characters, plus a drawing of a vehicle they drive. I wouldn't need drawings from all angles or anything...just a little eye candy for potential producers.

* If this is not common practice, Is it usually just a flat fee up front? If so, is there any sort of a standard amount?

* Do illustrators ever work on a deferred basis? So basically, we'd make an agreement that if the writer sells the show, then the illustrator gets paid a pre-determined amount. Is that a thing that happens?

Thanks for taking the time. Much appreciated.",,False,,t5_2qh79,False,,,True,t3_1fkhpe,http://www.reddit.com/r/Illustration/comments/1fkhpe/i_am_a_writer_for_film_and_television_and_have/,

I'm actually a graphic designer by trade but I've been doing some freelance illustration work on the side for awhile now (nothing too big or official, mostly album artwork, posters, commissions, etc). Today I got an email from a PR company in the UK that would like to buy the usage rights for two of my illustrations (here's one of them: [big ben](http://debbiefong.tumblr.com/post/6326448806/london-series-1-big-ben) ). They want to use them to pitch an idea to one of their fashion/makeup clients for a pouch bag design.

My question is, can I limit the usage rights to just this one application that they're proposing? Or can they use the illustrations in any way they want once they have them? Can I also continue to use them in any way that I want? Also, what the heck should I charge for something like this?
