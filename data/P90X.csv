1338226386.0,128,self.P90X,u8yad,So you want to start p90x ? Potentially helpful hints and ramblings of a p90x advocate. (Long Read),142,14,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/u8yad/so_you_want_to_start_p90x_potentially_helpful/,"Let me preface this by saying that I am not a Doctor, Elite athlete nor nutritionist and these are just my opinions based on my experience and information gathered from various sources. I am just a normal person who wanted to get in shape after letting my health and eating habits slip. I would just like to share a little information about myself before we get into the topic of p90x. 

Started p90x in 2011 and have completed 1 full cycyle in addition to various modified cycles. At my heaviest I was up to 192lbs in 2011 and currently weigh around 164lbs. Grew up very active playing a variety of sports including football/weight lifting, martial arts and track. I think that gave me a strong base for p90x but any one can excel at the program with modification.

**Intro TL:DR Played sports when young, got older and fatter. P90x has helped me lose 20+ lbs.**

The most important thing I want you to take away from this write up is learning how to **MODIFY**. I am talking about modifying the exercises, schedule, diet, calories, and recover/rest and pretty much anything else you can think of. We will touch on Modifying throughout.

**Expectations:**
What should you expect from the p90x program?

•P90x is not easy, P90x is hard and there will be days (especially in the beginning) when you are incredibly sore and want to quit. DO NOT QUIT, modify the workout if needed.

•P90x actors are more than likely in better shape than you and have already completed the program at least once. They will do more reps than you and you shouldn’t feel bad, but what you can do is keep working towards catching them.

•P90x requires a real commitment of working out 60-90 minutes 6 days a week and is a serious fitness program.

•P90x will get you into shape and give you a solid base for doing other things (running, heavy lifting, SS etc.)

•P90x is not a super, fast acting miracle workout. Results may take some time to materialize, don’t get discouraged if you only lost 3lbs in phase 1. Keep working hard and stick to the program/diet and the results will follow.

•P90x will typically not get you super ripped in 1 round (especially if you need to lose more than 15 lbs, that being said if you do multiple rounds or modify your calorie intake anything is possible) 

•P90x should be accompanied by the supplied diet plan or your own Modified diet that follows similar guidelines. Example increased protein, fruits and vegetables while reducing processed foods etc.

•P90x will probably take more than 90 days to complete with real life events, sickness and other things happening. (My first round was like 105 days)

•For the Love of God listen to Tony Horton, as corny and dumb as some of his jokes can be he actually provides sound advice throughout all of the workouts. 

**Equipment**

Ok so now that you know what to expect and want to start need to make sure you have the right equipment. P90x does not require a ton of equipment and if you have the following equipment you will be good to go. 

•Resistance Bands and or Dumb Bells (Typically Ranging from 10-40lbs)

•A Chair 

•I highly recommend a pull-up bar even though you can modify using a band in the top of a door frame. 

•Yoga mat 

**Workouts**
Ok now that you are ready to put the DVD in and get ripped, let me offer a useful tip. Make the first week your “Practice Week” and introduction to p90x so you can get accustom to the exercises, intensity level, Tony’s advice and the program in general.  During this week I would use the pause button as much as needed and watch the actors and Tony to ensure your form is proper and/or which modified form of the exercise you feel most comfortable with.

After the practice week follow the program starting from day 1 and “Do your best and forget the rest”. That means keep hitting play and keeping working hard during the workouts. If you get winded and need to hit the pause button, do so but do not take extended breaks. If you can only do 2 pushups thats fine,after your 2 modify and do knee pushups the rest of the time. If a certain exercise causes extreme pain from a previous injury etc, then modify to another exercise you have learned and keep working hard. 

**Plyometrics:** This thing is a beast and is great interval training. Be prepared to have problems using stairs the next day, at least in the beginning. If you are struggling with this workout then now is time to modify to less intense version (Follow Pam) or stop the exercise before the 30 second timer (stop at 20 and use 10 seconds to recover). Then next week try to make it to the 25 second mark, until you are finally able to complete without stopping early or pausing. If you puke from doing this workout you might want to do Cardio X until your fitness level increases.

**Kenpo X:** This is kind of like a kick boxing/cardio workout. I have seen a lot of people complaining about this workout in this subreddit and I don’t quite get it. Maybe my martial arts background helps me with the form but if you are truly putting forth the effort this is a good workout. The only advice I could offer would be to make sure you are using your legs and torso to pivot during the punching. Also when you punch you should be engaging your core, the objective of this would be to prevent having the “wind knocked out of you by a landing counter punch. If you just stand there and move your arms, you are going to have a bad time. Give it a try with the tips I provided, if you insist on subbing it out I would recommend at least a 5mile run at 9-10 minute pace, or 45 minutes of moderatly intense jump rope.

**Yoga X:** I hate it, but I hate it … but I love the results. Do not skip the yoga, I promise you will despise Yoga X more than that crazy EX that stalked you. It is a difficult routine (especially if you do the optional pushups) and there will a lot of positions in the beginning that will have you saying “Get the F#ck out of here I can’t bend like that”. At the end of the day it will greatly improve your flexibility and overall performance in other workouts.

**Resistance Workouts:** All of the resistance workouts are pretty self-explanatory and I have included a quick note that Tony covers multiple times during the workouts.

**Muscle/Body Preference**

*Bigger*: Use heavier weights so that you can feel the burn around rep 6 and you struggle to complete 8-9

*Lean*: Use less weight and complete 12-15 reps, if you are able to complete 20 reps of an exercise you should probably move up your weight some.

**DIET**

p90x diet info from Reddit User Amulcent

&gt;""The official P90X nutrition guide spells out a diet consisting of consuming foods from the top tiers of michi's ladder in three different macro nutritional phases that changes ever 30 days.""

**Phase 1** - Fat Shredder - 50P/25C/25F The first 30 days of the official P90X diet you are advised to consume calories in a ratio of 50% protein, 30% carbs, and 20% fat. Fat Shredder was updated in the P90X2 nutrition guide to a ratio of 50% protein, 25% carbs, and 25% fat. 

**Phase 2** - Energy Booster - 40P/40C/20F Days 31 - 60 of the official P90X diet changes the macro ratio to prevent a plateau. The increased carbs are recommended with the phase 2 workouts as they do get more difficult with addition of Chest, Shoulder, Tri and Back &amp; Biceps.

**Phase 3** - Endurance Maximizer - 30P/50C/20F - Days 61 - 90 of the official P90X diet will again alter the macro ratio to prevent a plateau. This is a muscle building diet, you need a lot of carbs to give you tons of energy and fuel the muscles to the max.

**My Thoughts and Current Diet**

I am not going to tell anyone what they should eat but I will provide my information and let you use that as a starting point. I am a 30+ male who has an office job who started the program at 185+, currently 165lbs and would like to reach a weight of 158ish. My daily caloric intake is around 1900 and that includes me running 25-35 miles a week with the p90x program. I try to maintain a modified paleo diet where 85% of the time I avoid wheat, dairy, gluten and processed sugars among other things. I try to stay near Phase 1 for the entire workout and modify depending on how my workouts go.

Everybody is different and their bodies react differently, so this is another chance to MODIFY something. If you are getting burned out during work outs you can slightly increase your calories/carbs. Conversely if you feel great during most workouts and want to expedite the weight lose then decrease your calories. Ideally you would want to stick with lean meats and more fruits and vegetables, for those interested I attached a few diet links. At the end of the day if your goal is to lose weight I would be on a balanced diet that created a calorie deficit and if you want to gain weight then eat more and lift heavier weights.  

**Conclusion:**

I absolutely love p90x and with some creativity and planning you can modify it to meet almost any physical goal you want to accomplish. Maybe after this 8 week program I will post some pictures, sorry this ran long. If anybody has any further questions please feel free to ask.

http://imgur.com/a/837K7

I gotta say, very impressed with this program.  Sure we all make fun of Tony, but this program did exactly what it needed to do for me, kick me into shape!  I turn 30 next month, i've never had my abs like this before, definitely the best shape of my life.

Some info and how I did the program:

After about week 2-3, i totally cut out the Yoga, i tried it, gave up on it.  I decided to do something else that day - so instead I did some running.  Usually a 5K on my lunch break on the treadmill (it was winter).  Other than that, i didn't stray too far from the routine.  Sometimes instead of Kenpo I did Core Synergistics.  I was in pretty good shape at day 1, i have a gym membership and usually went there on my lunch breaks, doing my own usually routines 4 days a week.  So starting P90X still gave me a swift kick because it was something new to start.  Week 1 brought in some soreness (ESPECIALLY my abs) - but it didn't last too long, you work through it.

Diet:
cut out all sodas, sugars, drank alot more water.
breakfast was either oatmeal with natural peanut butter &amp; whey protein, or a healthy cereal (variety of choices).
lunch was deli meats, greek yogurt, and either a protein bar or whey protein shake.
dinners was usually meats/veggies/pasta, nothing super strict.

I would always have a whey protein shake or recovery shake when finishing the workouts.

I used Optimum Nutrition multi-vitamins (Opti-Men), Whey Protein, and their After Max recovery shake mix.  Definitely recommend it.

I never counted calories, still ate the ""bad"" food at times, but i figured i'd be burning it off with a little extra effort.",,False,,t5_2rmaw,False,,,True,t3_s1x6g,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/s1x6g/my_90_day_results_this_program_works/,

I had tons of excuses at the ready, and they were all bad.  My lunch was small and I felt a bit weak.  It's okay to skip because I went for a run yesterday.  I tweaked my back a while ago, maybe it would be wise to rest.  Seriously, I just didn't *feel* like it.  

But I remembered that every time I've done P90X (I'm six weeks into it) I felt amazing afterwards, even though I could never remember how I felt *before* I did it.  Even if I felt whiny, tired, lazy or just like crap.  Want to feel amazing?  Just press play.

So I did it anyway, and even though I started out at less than optimal intensity, by the time I finished (Back &amp; Biceps + Abs) I was Bringing It (tm).  None of the excuses I had were better than the way I felt when I was done!

[After Plyo X](http://imgur.com/Fs0yrDq)

* So just a brief recap: I started a year ago at around 215-220 very very overweight. I had already done some running but was looking to get really fit. Also, I'm 6' tall incase I didn't mention that already.

**Round 1** So I did one round of P90X straight up with no modifications and lost a decent amount of weight. 

**Round 2** My second round was another P90X but instead of doing Yoga X I did P90X2 Yoga X because it was a bit shorter. I ended up loosing more weight and getting down to about 170-169, but it left me looking really skinny.

**Round 3** My third round was a P90X - P90X2 - Insanity - 1 on 1's Hybrid with a focus on putting on some muscle mass. To accomplish this I started eating 3000 calories a day instead of the 2400 and put on about 5 lbs. The before and after pictures from this round saw some pretty big muscle gains. I stopped looking so scrawny and started looking a little more built.

**Round 4** This round was about cutting off some of the fat I picked up in Round 3. My goal was to cut down from 175 back to 170, so this wasnt a full 90 day round. I think in the end it lasted about 3 weeks and I did it via a P90X, P90X+, P90X2, 1 on 1's, Insanity, Body Beast Hybrid.

**Round 5** This round was back to putting on some muscle. Im currently 6 weeks in and so far have gone from about 169 to 176 while keeping my body fat somewhere around 8-8.5%. It's kinda hard to be accurate about it. This round was pretty much just a Body Beast, Insanity, P90X+, 1 on 1's hybrid.

* Also, I take pictures of myself everyday, so I put up a youtube video of my results from something like Day 1 to Day 305. Those videos can be found [Here - Flex](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgk3znUlOxQ) and [Here - Front](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSUxX1kg_mM)


* I'm still going strong and I still dont have the body I want, but I am looking forward to heading to the beach to get rid of my awful farmers tan. Hopefully this is motivating to you guys and if you have any questions feel free to ask.

Got a hell of lot stronger and am cranking out over 25 pull ups (something that was entirely out of realm of thinking before starting this program).

The keys to my success were getting the wife on board with the nutrition and learning to eat less empty carbs and more protein rich food.  I also went through the workouts with my hyper-competitive brother.  We constantly checked in on each other via text or phone calls with positive messages and encouragement to stay the course.

There will be many obstacles you will have to endure for the 90 days, but I can honestly tell you that there is almost nothing that feels as good as being fit, especially at my age - 36 in a couple of weeks!!! O_o

Keep up the good work guys and gals, I will be hitting Insanity next!

I'm so excited about this! I made a new years resolution in 2011 to do 5 pullups by the end of the year, and that didn't work out so well, and now I'm finally putting the effort in and busting my butt everyday and it is totally paying off.

Today was day 90, and I've succesfully completed round 1 of P90X, I start round 2 tomorrow, and I'm looking forward to it.

Day 1 I couldn't do two pushups in a row, now I'm knocking them out like it's nothing, I went from 0 pullups to 12-15 in a row, from sissy 3kg dumbbells to 15kg ones.


I've lost 35 pounds, 7 inches around the tummy, and inches EVERYWHERE.

I've stuck to a 40% carbs, 30% fat, 30% protein (1600 cal) dietplan pretty religiously for all 90 days, no cheatdays, just days where my ratios weren't spoton ( and some where they were really bizarre )

I have missed a few workouts but have made sure to not miss any liftdays.

And here comes the pictures!

First there's two gifs, cycling through day 1, 30, 60, 90, 1, 90.

Things go well and we are walking home. She jokes that if we get mugged I can save her with my P90X moves. Anyway, we are walking and these two guys come up to us in baggy clothes. They aren't really creepy or anything - they are street peddlers, trying to crank out that last sale in the evening. So they show us a bunch of stuff. We're really not interested, but this first guy really doesn't want to take no for an answer. 

Half-jokingly to impress my date, I say ""Back Knuckles, Front Kick, Back Kick"" and mime the moves.

So I started on March 28th. Yesterday was 90 days from the start. I didn't miss a single regular workout but went pretty easy on some of the recovery weeks. First recovery week I only did 1 day of Yoga and 1 day of Kenpo as I was on vacation. I went running, surfing, swimming, biking that week instead. Second recovery week I did 1 of each activity (Yoga, Kenpo, Core Syn) and went running that week. Final recovery week I skipped most as I have been out running and surfing quite a bit.

I did not miss or skip a single regular workout though. I kept through every workout start to finish with only a few pauses here or there. 

I have been fairly active though in addition to P90X. Ran a 10km official race, ran 10k's a few other times and then a ton of 3-8km runs as well (usually ran 2-3 times a week), surfing once or twice a week and biking as well. Just casual biking to the store, etc.

Did not follow the nutrition plan at all. Just ate healthy (as best I could anyways. No fast food, only drank on 2 occasions, cut back huge on sugars and chocolates and chips).

I am not entirely sure of weight loss, I don't believe I lost alot as I gained back a good amount of muscle. I feel and look healthier and am as fit as I have been in the last 10 years.

I am new to protein shakes, recovery drinks etc. So I wasn't sure what I needed. On Plyo days and weight days I drank 'Muscle Milk' an hour after the workout. I have since finished that and switched to 'Ultimate Nutrition's 100% Whey'. 

I increased my pullups from Max 3 to Max 25-30 (depending on the type). I can get through all 349 moves in Ab Ripper no problem. Plyometrics I have never really had an issue with but I can make it through that easily now.

Not related to P90X directly, but I started running the same time I started P90X. I couldn't run more then a couple km's without dying. I can run 10km now in under 49 minutes no problem. I haven't pushed myself further than that yet but my next goal is a half marathon in Sept.

Not sure what else to put in here! Just happy to be done! Had an awesome time doing it. I made two attempts at it over the last couple years (first time getting to day 50, second only day 35) so I am proud I kept through it! If anyone has any questions please ask!

Cheers!

[Pics](http://imgur.com/a/wlVVv#0)

I'm 26 and 6'

Started in January of this year weighing 282lbs and incredibly out of shape. After the first round I was down to 227 for a 55lbs loss. Stuck mostly to P90x but never was a fan of the Yoga. Maybe did it 6 times. Usually swapped it with Kenpo or Insanity. I'll do it occasionally on a Sunday now if I feel like I need a good stretch. Also towards the end I would swap out Kenpo with an insanity workout. Usually Pure Cardio or Plyo.

I was very happy with my results so for the second round decided to do a P90x/Insanity hybrid. It was absolutely miserable at first and only got worse the 2nd month when the Max workouts started. Stuck with it and am currently down to 201lbs. Missed a week during the 2nd round due to vacation but I did Insanity workouts and ran while on vacation. 

Going forward I plan to do another round of the P90x/Insanity hybrid then move on to P90x2 and give it a go. I would ideally like to get down to the 180lb range. Weight loss has become a struggle now but I'm still losing inches so I'm not terribly worried about that.

I didn't follow the nutrition guide. I just cut calories and made sure I ate a lot of protein. For the first found I ate around 1500-1700 on any given day. Second round I bumped it up to 1800-2000 per day. For supplements I used Shaklee energizing soy protein, Shaklee Physique(recovery shake) and ON whey protein

Edit: He's some more info on my diet:

I finished with legs and back (fuck one legged wall squats and their entire family), and it was time for me to move on to ARX. The two other times I have done it, I did probably 50-70% of the reps total, which I was happy with considering that I struggle to do 15 crunches normally. I sat there today and told myself that I was going to do every single rep that was asked of me. It involved a lot of pausing (occasionally at the halfway point of a set), and I probably doubled the amount of time ARX normally takes. I don't care. I pushed through and did every single rep, which I didn't even think was possible just 5 days ago.


Moral of the story: If you are struggling with anything here, pause, collect yourself, and do what you can. If I can get all the way through ARX, I PROMISE you can too. Now to get to the point where I can keep up with Tony!

I read the P90X materials cover to cover, read lots of trainer blogs, spent a week reading the BeachBody message boards and various articles by their professional trainers, watched lots of random youtube videos, etc., and the info you find below is an amalgamation of much of that info (or what I found useful and implemented).  I'm just trying to pass on what I learned and save you some time.  You'll have to gauge for yourself what's right for you.  There's no one perfect route that everyone should apply, so take this post more as DEscriptive rather than PREscriptive (even though it probably reads like the latter at times).

STARTING OUT

I thought I'd share what I've learned from completing the first phase of P90X, for anyone who's interested.  A lot of this info has been posted on various threads around here, but I thought I'd share my experiences thus far in a single post.

I started out in decent shape (40 pushups, 7 pullups, 2 minutes seated against the wall) and with a 22.2 BMI (at 5' 10"") and took this program on for a couple of reasons: one, I don't like gyms and wanted something I could setup at home; two, I usually prefer running, but my current living situation doesn't allow for it anymore; and three, I wanted a flexible-yet-structured program and someone to tell me what to do.  For me, these considerations made the DVDs, gear, supplements, and eating habit changes worthwhile.

I'm now 3 days into Phase 2, and I'm already adding mass and getting cut.  I should note that my weight hasn't changed, but my body composition definitely has (not sure the numbers exactly).  I was recently down South for a wedding and got a number of comments like, ""What have you been doing?!? You're so CUT now!""  I'm not someone who's ever been big and bulky...I've usually been the skinny guy...but P90X is changing that, even after Phase 1.

Below I'll lay out the gear, supplements, eating habits / strategies, and thoughts on exercises I've accumulated up to this point.  While I'm obviously not done with the program yet, I consider what I've done so far a complete success. I put a lot of time into researching the program ahead to increase the chance that I'd see it through, and that knowledge, which I'm sharing here, seems to be paying off.

I’m including prices, some of which might put you off to the idea of doing P90X or the route I’ve taken, but I’d urge everyone to think about outfitting their home for fitness like they’d outfit it for computing or cooking—it obviously takes a chunk of change to get up and running / functional.  Better yet, if you buy quality and you’re committed to the idea of a fitter lifestyle beyond just 90 days, you’ll save money in the long run (at least compared to a gym membership and personal trainers…and possibly health costs).   Plus, most of the gear you buy won’t be obsolete in 3-5 years like a computer would be.

Last note before everything else…I bought most of my gear and supplements through Amazon.  If you’re a student, signup for a free Amazon Prime membership and get most of the shipping in two days for free.

GEAR

One can obviously drop a lot of cash on every aspect of P90X, but it can also be done on a tight budget.  My approach, in my own estimation, was more middle-of-the-road; that is, I wanted to buy quality equipment that would last long after the program and be relevant for other uses, but I didn’t want to break the bank, either.  Here’s what I use, and I thoroughly recommend everything listed here:

P90X DVDS, $139.80.  Maybe you can find them used, but getting a new copy will ensure quality.  Consider using your own sleeve to store them to prevent scratches.

PowerBlock Personal Trainer Adjustable 2.5 to 50-Pounds per Dumbbell Set, $349.00.  This is easily the biggest expenditure, but it saves space and will last a long time.  Bands are clearly an option for the budget-minded, but these blocks are easy to store, easy to use, and not at all awkward for exercises in P90X.  I suspect I’ll get rid of these after Round 1 and get the larger set.  For now, however, these are perfect for someone who can do, say, 15 bicep curls with 25 lbs (one arm).

Manduka BlackMat PRO Yoga Mat, $80.  Cheaper mats are available, but this one is said to last forever and have a great (lifetime?) warranty.  It’s heavy-duty and, after a couple wipe-downs, not slippery.  A good mat is important not just for yoga, but also for stretching in Kenpo, X Stretch, and doing Ab Ripper X.  Get a cheap mat if you only want it for 90 days.  Get a more expensive one if you want to use it after the program.

Iron Gym Total Upper Body Workout Bar - Extreme Edition, $38.00.  The cheap, highly-rated option to the P90X bar.  Corn-cob pullups are tough on this, but I think they’d be tough on the P90X bar—no big deal.  Definitely a good place to save money.

Altus Athletic Push-Up Stands, $8.23.  Cheap but sturdy and provide an improved range of motion.  These help you get the most out of pushups, and they’re easier on your wrists.

Harbinger 143 Men's Pro FlexClosure Wash &amp; Dry Gloves, $13.50.  I did the first week without these and killed my hands on pullups.   No pain or blisters with these, though. Cheap, well made, and washable.

3” Yoga Blocks (2), $5.49 each.  Great if you’re new to yoga and not that flexible, but you can also use a shoebox or something similar.

Accu-Measure Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester, $5.45.  Completely optional, but fun if you want to track your body fat and don’t have a scale that does it automatically.

Sundesa Blenderbottle with Blenderball, $8.30.  Ideal for mixing recovery drink, creatine, and/or glutamine supplements.

Tribest Mason Jar Single Serving Blender PB350 - BPA FREE, $85.00.  I use this to make protein shakes in the morning (1 C frozen fruit, 1.5 scoops whey, top off with skim milk).  Just drink from the glass. Big time saver, insanely easy to clean (20 second rinse under hot water).  Didn’t want to buy another gadget, but can’t recommend this enough.  Shake plus a banana is breakfast (even though it goes over the fruit limit a bit).

SUPPLEMENTS

Lots of pills in this section—big honkin’ pills.  If you can’t swallow big pills, it’s time to learn.  ☺  I tried to find the cheapest, high-quality stuff available.

100% Whey Protein - Gold Standard, $39.99.  Essential to get enough protein that first month.  Double chocolate is yummy.

Endurox R4 (4.63 lbs), $33.02.  More affordable than P90X version, decent-tasting (fruit punch), and definitely something I look forward to when I finish.  This is shopped as a recovery drink and has that 4:1 carb/protein ratio that’s proven to help you bounce back.  Def. a decent option.  I know lots of people swear by chocolate milk, but milk just doesn’t sound appealing to me after a big workout.  Also, I have this usually 4-5 times a week—lifting days, plyo, and sometimes Kenpo or Yoga.  As with all supplements, I try and conserve them if I can.

Clif Builder's Variety Pack 18 - Bars (9 chocolate, 9 peanut butter), $21.15.  My high-protein, very comparable (yet cheaper) replacement for the P90X bars.  Taste great and are perfect on the go.  I’ve been eating one at work between breakfast and lunch.  Really, really like these, and they get cheaper ($17ish) if you subscribe to them on Amazon.

Opti-Men Multivitamin 180 tabs, $19.43.  I’d say this (or a multi of some sort) is essential.  This is a great cheap alternative to all the other expensive options. I take two a day instead of the three the label recommends. 

Optimum Nutrition - Creatine, 600 g powder, $20.95.  Optional, but great if looking for size and/or maximum results.  Safely increases muscle cell size (with water) and allows for greater nutrient absorption.  I’m cycling this, 2 months on, 1 month off.  

Optimum Nutrition - Glutamine, 1000 g powder, $33.65.  Optional, but proven to quicken recovery.  I mix this in with recovery drink.  

Nature Made Organic Flaxseed Oil 1,000 mg - 225 Softgels, $16.31.  Optional, but a great way to round out essential fatty acids.  And pretty darn cheap.  Morning pill with multi.

Kirkland Signature Fish Oil w/ Omega-3 Enteric Coated 180 Softgels, $22.99.  Another cheap way to round out fatty acids.  Plus, the coating ensures you won’t have fishy burps all day.  Even so, I still take this at night (w/ second multi), just in case.

Jack3d, $25.60.  Optional, but a well known energy booster to take before a workout.  I use this only on days when I’m not feeling up to the task and need some extra energy, which is maybe 1-2 times per week.  Some people like it for every workout, but I’d rather conserve.

In the end, I put on about 6 lbs over the 90 days while lowering my body fat % from about 11% to about 9%. Overall I'm pretty pleased with the results.

My Day 1 vs. Day 305 pictures can be seen here 
(http://imgur.com/a/eaO83)

Also, to help motivate myself I took pictures of myself every day from different angles. When I posted my 270 day results on reddit before a lot of people said I should edit the pictures together into a progression video. So I did my best to do that. I don't have any experience with editing so please excuse the terrible quality.

Here are my flexing pictures (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgk3znUlOxQ)

And my front pictures (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSUxX1kg_mM)

I also have pictures from about 5 other angles, but it takes me forever to edit because I'm so slow.

Also, tons of people were asking me about diet last time. So I took screenshots of the excel document I use to calculate how much I should eat and uploaded it here (http://imgur.com/a/9tEuq)  I have my Round 3 and what I plan to do for Round 4 on there.


So I guess a bit about myself for those who dont know, I'm 24, 6'0"" and currently way about 174. When I first started P90X, I was 205 ish, but at that point I was already down from roughly 220 by running. My first round of P90X was straight up, no substitutions, no skipped days, ate perfectly clean and DID MY YOGA AND KEMPO!! The only difference between my first and second round was I switched the P90X2 Yoga out for P90X Yoga. The third round, which I just finished was a hybrid of a bunch of programs with focus on increasing strength through caloric surplus. If any of you guys care I can post my workout schedule.

Sorry for the block of text. Hopefully you guys and gals enjoy. If you have any questions feel free to ask

Anyways, I worked for the Philadelphia Eagles for 5 years within their front office, and we had the unique opportunity to have a private P90x session with Tony.  

He hosted the workout inside our indoor practice field so weights were not involved.  The workout was essentially a hybrid of Legs/Back, Plyo, Chest/Back.  It was over an hour long, and many players also participated which was surprising since it was the off season.

Tony had 2 assistants with him and they helped run the workout.  He's just as energetic in person as he is on the DVDs.  Oh, and his jokes were just as lame as well.

Anyone curious about anything - or was this just a stupid idea to even write out?

I finished P90X yesterday!  It was an awesome journey and I'm so glad I did it.  I went from 267 to 235 (20yr old F), so a total lb lost of 32.  I started out not being able to do a sit up or a push up now I can do them quite easily.  This is only the beginning of my fitness journey, next up is Insanity after a ten day break (but not on the dieting part!).  I LOVE BeachBody for giving me the first program I've been able to stick with and get results with.

Here's my inches lost, a bit too self conscious to post my pics...

Waist -7
Hips -6
Bust -5.5
Biceps -4 (each)
Thighs -4.5 (each)


EDIT:  Thought about it, and decided to share my pics.  Cause fuck it, I made progress.  May not be where I want to be yet, but this is progress.  Also...yes there is a bandage over my belly button...managed to get an infection in there.

I still was terrible at pullups though.  I went from being able to do 1 on day 1 to 5 on day 90 (not that great of an improvement).  I would always do the few that I could do unassisted and then put a leg on the chair in front of me and do 8-10 with the chair.

Frustrated with plateauing at 5 pull ups, I realized after the 90 days that putting a leg on the chair in front of me would tilt my body towards the ceiling, which would turn the pullup into somewhat of a row exercise.  My lats really were not that sore the day after the pullup workouts and I could never figure out why.

Now when I do assisted pullups, I put the chair BEHIND me, bend a leg and put my toe on the chair.  It seems like my body stays much more vertical and my lats are a lot more sore the following day.

TL;DR try putting the chair behind you instead of in front for assisted pullups",,False,,t5_2rmaw,False,,,True,t3_q2g4k,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/q2g4k/pullup_tip_for_beginners/,

260 lbs
Male
Haven't done a real exercise since highschool gym class
First time with the P90X


So I started the video with a huge grin on my face, thinking to myself ""Yeah, time to get ripped!"". Day 1 is the chest and back, along with ab ripper x. The warm up itself was a little tiring, but I thought to myself ""Meh...this isn't so hard...I wonder why people think it's so bad"". 

Then the work out started

I tried my best to keep up with the people in the video. I pushed myself as much as I could with every pushup, every pull up, ever lawnmower, etc... But I just couldn't keep up with any of them. It was disheartening. I thought screw it, I'll just start jogging or something instead. So I turned off the video and went upstairs. That's when I walked along the mirror by my living room and saw myself. Sweating, out of breath, red in the face, and giving up. Every memory I ever had of being called fat ass, fat fuck,  jumbo, bitch tits came back to me. Every memory of being too scared to ask out a girl because I was too fat for her, or being too scared to go out in public because of my weight came flooding back. 

That's when I said fuck it, literally. I looked at myself in the mirror and said fuck you fatty. I rushed back downstairs and started up the video again. I couldn't keep up with the people in the video but that didn't matter. As Tony says ""Try your best, forget about the rest"". I'm putting in 100% of my heart and soul into this workout hoping for a better life and higher self esteem. I got my ass kicked, but it doesn't matter. I tried. And that's all I can do. I might not be pushing out 20 diamond pushups or 20 reverse chinups, but it doesn't matter. I'll get there eventually, and I just have to keep trying. 

I woke up this morning with the most sore body I've had in years, and I love it. I'm on my way downstairs to start day 2 and I couldn't be happier. No more feeling sorry for myself, no more eating away my sorrows. Every day is one step closer to asking out a cute girl and not being embarrassed to. 

Just thought I'd share my first day. Hopefully I can share my day 90 pics with you guys and look as great as all of you :)



Edit: Just finished plyo.......oh dear god that was brutal. I stuck in there though. I had to hit pause more times than I'm proud to admit, but I didn't skip any exercise and just went at it full on.

1341440224.0,43,self.P90X,w1tls,I've been doing P90X for two years.  Here is my experience and advice for anyone doing P90X.  ,54,11,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/w1tls/ive_been_doing_p90x_for_two_years_here_is_my/,"I’ve been doing P90X for quite a while now.  I’m not sure how many rounds I’ve technically done and I have only ever made it to the full 90 day mark twice.  I’m a PhD student, so when the semester would get close to finals time I’d have to quit for a few weeks and then I would just pick it up again at day 1. In short, I’ve been doing it fairly consistently for two years.  I thought I would post my experience and advice that I wish someone would have given me when I began P90X.  I’m sure none if it is going to be ground breaking, but hopefully it can help someone.  

A little information about me, so you know the perspective I’m coming from.  I’m 28 years old and male.  I’ve always been really small and I have had a difficult time gaining weight.  I’m 6’ tall and my current weight 162 pounds and body fat is around 18%.  When I started doing P90X I was probably around 145-150 pounds.  I’ve been a long time runner and I have ran consistently since I was 17 years old. I’ve ran quite a few marathons in my life.  I started P90X to gain some more upper body strength.  I have 2 more weeks to go in this final round of P90X and then I’m going to hit the gym and start doing more compound type lifts to gain more muscle.  I’d like to try P90X2 and probably eventually will, but like Tony said in a recent interview “P90X2 and ‘Body Beast’ are on complete opposite ends of the spectrum.” I’m sure I would like P90X2, but where I want to get some really big strength and muscle gains I think compound lifts at the gym are probably more suited for what I’m looking for.  You can definitely gain muscle with P90X, but it is more tailored towards overall body fitness and losing weight.  But I love P90X! And I’m going to miss it.  It is so nice to be able to wake up and push play on your DVD player and workout rather than go the gym.  Here is my advice. 

First, buy some weights that make it so you can switch weight quickly (i.e. I use the Bowflex Selecttech Weights, but there are others types out there.  Just research it and figure out what will work best for you).  For the first year I did P90X I used collar weights, so I would have to pause the DVD and switch weights manually and it sucked! I got tired of switching weights, so sometimes I would just use the weight from the previous exercise for the one I was currently doing.  Not a good idea.  I wish I would have had the Selecttech weights from the beginning.

Second, use your worksheets and write everything down.   I haven’t been the best at this.  The first few times I did P90X I was pretty good at it, but I saved all my workout sheets and I would get them confused with sheets from previous rounds and it turned into a mess.  I would print out your worksheets, staple them all together, and write the date above each workout when you’re finished.  This way you won’t get confused if you do multiple rounds.  I wish I could go back and look at my sheets from the very first time I did P90X and see how far I’ve come.  

Third, always be cognizant about how much weight/pull-ups/pushups you did last time and always try to increase.  This is also related to #2.  Just like Tony says “How do you know what to do if you don’t what you did?” I think this is especially true for the exercises with weights.  I’ve always been more of a 6-8 rep man than an 8-10 rep man, but whatever you decide to do whenever you reach that max number of reps make sure you up the weight next time and see how many reps you can get.  Sometimes I could get 8 reps with a weight, but it was really hard, so I would just do the same weight and get 8 reps the next time I tried and this was a mistake.  Always up the weight when you reach your max reps. 

Fourth, modify! I don’t think I can stress this enough.  This is especially true for pushups, pull-ups, and yoga.  When I do pushups I start with the bars and go for as long as I can.  When I can’t do anymore I drop to my knees and still use the bars.  When I can’t do any more of those I lose the bars, so I’m just doing pushups on my knees.   I was watching an interview with Tony recently and he suggested never go to your knees.  He said to just stay in the regular pushup position and just go down far enough so you can get back up.  I haven’t played around with this much, but it sounds like a good option.   When it comes to pull-ups I wish I would have been utilizing negative pull-ups the whole time, but unfortunately I’ve only incorporated them in the last year.  I’ve never really had much of a problem with pull-ups, but I’ve gotten a lot better at them.  I start out by doing as many as I can with regular form.  When I can’t do those anymore I switch to negatives.  When I can’t do those anymore I start using the chair.  I talked my sister into doing P90X and she tried the yoga video and then called me and said “yeah I started doing it, but I couldn’t really do what they were doing, so I just quit.”  I don’t think anything anyone has ever said to me has pissed me off more in my life.  I mean seriously what the fuck? Modify the yoga and just do what you can.  I’ve been runner all my life, so you would think I would be flexible. Wrong.  I’m not at all and I still modify the shit out of yoga.  

Fifth, just like Tony says “Don’t neglect your yoga!” I’ve been neglecting my yoga that last year and I can definitely tell.  I’m starting to get some good gains in my back and shoulder area and I can tell that I’m losing flexibility and I’m not happy about it.  Yeah the hour and half of yoga is a bitch and I hate it too, but no other workout gives me greater satisfaction when I have completed it than yoga.  In addition, it has significantly helped my running.  I’ve frequently suffered knee pain due to having a really tight IT band and nothing has helped this more than doing yoga.

Sixth, I would not recommend running frequently while doing P90X.  I love running and I miss it. When I first started doing P90X I would run three to four days a week on the non-cardio days.  After a while I figured out that I was just burning way too many calories and that is why I wasn’t gaining as much as I would have liked.  In addition, P90X is a lot of leg work and adding three to four six mile runs a week was making my legs exhausted.  For the last year I’ve only ran once a week usually on Sundays.  Like I said I miss it a lot (especially since I found the “Zombie Run app” which is fucken awesome!) but doing P90X is enough.  If you are doing P90X and trying to lose weight, but you aren’t losing as much as you would like I would recommend re-evaluating your diet.  Just doing P90X should be enough.  When I stopped consistently running I bought a heavy bag (which is really fun and an awesome workout) and started using it on my cardio days as well.  It took the strain off my legs, but again I was burning too many calories.  Now I use my heavy bag on my kempo days and it has really added to that workout and makes it really fun.  

Seventh, and the most important.  Diet is everything.  I’ve always understood this and thought I was doing great.  I’ve always been a really healthy “clean” eater.  I never ate “food porn,” which is good, but for me trying to gain weight and strength I was never eating enough calories.  I have always been really reluctant to count calories, because I thought it was hard and is sounded like being in prison to me.  But with the My Fitness Pal app it is really easy.  Six months ago I started making sure that I’m eating 3500-4000 calories a day and holy shit is it a different world for me now.  I’m starting see some really crazy gains and really gaining weight!  I was just never eating enough calories and burning way too many calories, especially when adding the additional workouts.  Sure I was healthy and in “good shape,” but I was never able to add as much muscle and strength as I would have liked.  I can only imagine where I would be today if I would have started counting my calories and ensuring I was taking in enough calories when I began P90X two years ago.

That is my experience and advice for doing P90X.  I’m not a fitness guru or the zen master of P90X or anything.  I’d say I’m in good shape, but I definitely don’t have huge muscles or anything, so just take my advice for what it is worth.  I’ll post after pictures (I never did take any before pics) on here when I’m done with this round.  Sorry for the long post, but thanks for reading! And remember to BRING IT!

tl;dr:  First, buy some weights that make it so you can switch weight quickly. Second, use your worksheets and write everything down.   Third, always be cognizant about how much weight/pull-ups/pushups you did last time and always try to increase.  Fourth, modify!  Fifth, just like Tony says “Don’t neglect your yoga!”  Sixth, I would not recommend running frequently while doing P90X.  Seventh, and the most important.  Diet is everything.

Quick Background - 24 year old, 5'7 ft, male. I've done a few round of P90X on and off before (1 legit round were I ate almost perfect and didn't miss any workouts for the 90 days), a p90x/1-on-1 hybrid and some heavy lifting at the gym trying to add mass.

I injured my neck back in October 2011 lifting too heavy and having improper form on some moves. This lead to a complete halt in my efforts to get fit until I started X2- I completely stopped working out and started eating fast food and junk again just about everyday if not multiple times a day.

I started P90X2 Jan. 2 and Finished March 30th. Day 1 I started at 11.75% body fat and by day 90 I was at 8.40%. I actually only lost .6 lbs. I started at 155.8 and finished at 155.2. Here are the measurements:

Chest: Day1: 34.75' Day 90: 36.5'

Waist (at navel): Day 1: 31.5 Day 90: 30.25

Right Arm mid bicep(not flexing): Day1: 12.75 Day 90: 12.25

Hips(At widest point): Day 1: 39' Day90: 37.25'

Right Thigh: Day1: 20.75 Day90: 21.5

Right Calf: Day1: 14.25' Day 90: 14.5

Diet: My goal wasn't to lose weight, just body fat, so I stayed on a 40/40/20 diet the entire time, but I kept adjusting my calories slightly each week until I got it right which happened around week 8 which ended up being around 2100 calories (not including post workout shake). I practically ate the same thing everyday, it wasn't fun after awhile, but it was the easiest and cheapest way to do it. A typical day looks like this; Breakfast - 2 cups of cheerios, 1 cup of berries, almonds and a protein shake. AM snack - 3/4 cup of egg whites and 1/2 whole wheat bagel. Lunch - 4oz low sodium turkey, 2 slices of whole wheat bread, 1/2 cheerios and almonds. PM snack - 1/2 cup no fat Cottage cheese and protein bar. Dinner - Turkey Burger -4oz 99% fat free turkey breast and 1 whole wheat bun. Before Bed - Protein Shake.

I really enjoyed P90X2. It is absolutely terrific for sports performance which the whole program is based upon and the 3rd phases is all about with the new PAP workouts. Unfortunately, I wasn't training for anything specific, but I have noticed big strength gains back at the gym and my core is stronger than ever. The new X2 Yoga is also amazing! I hated the yoga in p90x and skipped it often, but I really enjoy doing the new one and plan to started doing it at least twice a week from now on.

http://i.imgur.com/TDQLe.jpg

Edit: Had a few questions about my diet and the routine. (Probably should have included this in the first place). Figured it would be easier to post them here. First, I was able to follow the routine the whole way through without missing a day, nothing special there just a lot of perseverance I suppose.

As far as my diet, I didn't follow it verbatim, but what I did was follow the percentage guidelines in each stage. e.g. during stage 1 I was at 50% protein 30% carbs and 20% fat, at the bottom of my intake range. I switched this during phase 2 and 3 as well. Currently, I am back in stage 2 because I've lost quite a bit of weight. I tracked my diet every single day with the MyFitnessPal app. and while the workouts definitely boosted my overall strength I feel the alteration in my diet had just as big of an impact. 

Here is an interesting thread that I have used for calculating how many calories you can cut as well without cutting into muscle weight. http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/iynws/are_you_a_beginner_who_wants_to_lose_weight_wants/

Yet nobody seems to wonder how come Tony and all the crew behind him are sweating and panting. There really can be only two conclusions: either you are much more fit than they are or you are dogging it.

For those who don't consider themselves superior to Tony I recommend paying closer attention to how you do Kenpo. It is one of the easiest workouts to do half-assed. In Plyo you jump a lot and so you are bound to elevate your heart rate even if you aren't trying very hard. In Kenpo you have to drive yourself to high HR. Notice how Tony checks everyones heart monitors at one point in Kenpo.

Kenpo X is really intense for me. But yesterday I decided to make an experiment and focused on doing just the minimum amount of movements required for it to look like video. And it really was much easier and I didn't even drink that much water. 

Here is my top tip: don't focus on how to make the movements similar to video, focus ""how can I do this to my full intensity?"". I don't own a heart monitor, but I know when my heart is pumping on full and I know when I'm barely elevating my HR. 

Flex your muscles. Don't throw your arms out, flex them and then extend while flexing all the time. Make fast movements (this is another great thing about Kenpo - it works on your ""fast"" muscles, which don't get properly worked on during resistance workouts), jump instead of stepping into the hits. Kick higher, move your whole body more, do the jumps with Tony during the breaks.

Remember, Tony is the first guy to scorn you for making things too easy on yourself. So why would he include a workout in his program that he knew would be too easy for you?",,False,,t5_2rmaw,False,,,True,t3_yqs3h,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/yqs3h/do_kenpo_x_properly/,

That's 50.4 pounds in 172 days, or 24 weeks and 4 days, at an average of a little over 2 pounds a week. My goal weight I set was 190, so I am exactly half way there!

I'm liking what I see in the mirror! My wife and I both started together, we tried P90X to start with but it was just too much. We dropped back to Power 90 for a couple months then switched back to P90X. We are currently on week 2 of Phase 3. We purchased P90X2 from QVC when it was on special (came with a fitness ball and a shakeology sample free plus free shipping) and can't wait to jump on that next.

The biggest change I made to my diet was about 10 ago after watching [Fat, Sick &amp; Nearly Dead - Watch free on hulu](http://www.hulu.com/watch/289122/fat-sick-and-nearly-dead). I switched to juice fasting for breakfast and lunch and still eat a smart, healthy dinner with my family of 5.

Since juicing, I've lost an amazing 6 pounds in just 10 days. Thing is? My energy is now through the roof with all the vitamins and nutrients I'm getting.

Last summer, I decided to try and get in shape, although I didn't really know what I was doing. I ran, curled dumbells, and did crunches for the summer, but I didn't eat any better. I probably started at around 35% bodyfat, maybe higher, and lost some weight over the course of the summer. From there, I essentially flatlined until I started p90x in march. According to an online calculator (you plug in your weight and your waist circumference), I started at around 24% bodyfat, and am now at around 14% bodyfat, although I fear this calculator might be underestimating my bodyfat levels.



I've come a long way, but still have a ways to go. I did the workouts almost religiously, although I had to essentially skip legs and back entirely because of my knees. I lost a lot of fat on my stomach, but as you can see, I've got a case of the man boobs. Hopefully that'll come off as I work out on my own in a gym this summer.

I had to use my laptop webcam for the pics for days 0, 30, and 60, and because of the crappy camera reacting horribly to almost any kind of lighting, I had to use a different backdrop for each set of pictures. For day 90, I had a friend take the pictures for me on my phone, which has a much better camera. The last picture in day 90 is just me doing some weird pose my friend made me do that hurt my pec. 


Advice to beginners: Just keep pressing play. You don't really need to eat exactly what the nutrition plan tells you to eat, but if you can, stick with the macros it gives you and eat healthy. Beyond that, keep pressing play and do your best, but listen to your body. If your knees hurt during plyo or legs &amp; back, then just chill out for that day, maybe substitute the cardio video or yoga instead. As I gained the ability to do a lot of pushups, my wrists began to hurt, but I solved that by getting bars. I would definitely recommend pushup bars.


Some beginning/ending stats:

Weight: 185/161

Waist: 37in/31in

Bodyfat: ~24%/~14%

Bench Press (for 8 reps min): Probably below 100 lbs/135 lbs

Bicep Curl (dumbell, 8 reps min): 25lbs (per-hand)/35lbs (per-hand)

Vertical Leap: Could not reach a 9 foot ceiling/can graze a 10 foot ceiling.

I feel better than I ever have before in my entire life, and although there are things I could have done better to improve my 90-day results, I learned a lot about fitness and my body.

 * Think Thin protein bars (they have 230 cals and 20g protein, so were better than the P90X ones)


What went right:

 * Exercises: I really did ""bring it"" in all exercises. Throughout phases 1 and 2, I gave it 100%. In phase 3, i took it up to 11. There is a catch though. See below.
 * Nutrition: I stuck to the nutrition guide really well. I have  not eaten a SINGLE pizza slice or burger or drank a coke in the past 90 days. I felt myself slacking off in phase 3. It is much harder to stick to the nutrition plan when you go out, and I started going out a lot in the past month. Luckily, i was still very conscious and didn't eat anything catastrophic. Just the occasional serving of white rice or Naan or something.
 * Keeping track: I kept track of everything! How many reps i did of everything. What I ate every single day... etc. I also kept track on my white board of how far I am into the program and how every day is going. This really kept me motivated all the time.

What went wrong:

 * Injury: I had an injury in day 45 which kept me out for 20 days. It started as a minor injury, then I still did Yoga with the injury which turned it into something major and I had to be out for quite some time. I started phase 3 as soon as I recovered.
 * Photos: I didn't take good enough photos before starting. It was just the one photo you see above, taken in the dark without any real attention.
 * Nutrition guide: I realized too late that the nutrition guide really suggests too much food for my case. I should have stuck with around 2000 cal a day. 2400 was a lot more than I needed.
 * BRINGING IT: I made a mistake in phase 1 and 2 that I didn't realize until phase 3. I always kept the videos playing and played along. So, Tony would start wide front pull ups. I do 3, get tired, take a break, crank a couple more, he'd be done. I stop too. In phase 3, I learned that this is no good, so I started pausing the DVD over and over whenever I felt tired, so i can reach my goal. This was what really made it for me. I saw the numbers really going up in phase 3 because of this trick. When I do another run, I will take care of that from the get go. I am sure my results would have been a lot better had I done this from the beginning.

What's next:
 
I am gonna take 3 or 4 days off, eat whatever I want (Pizzas, burgers, icecream, you name it!) then I am gonna start P90X2! It has already arrived, and I can't wait to start! Look out for my day 180 results teehehe.

It was a hard but rewarding three months and I've never looked better. This subreddit was a good way to stay motivated and offered some great advice.

Here they are, a couple of pictures from day 0 to day 90.

[First](http://i.imgur.com/sHFYSnZ.jpg) [Second](http://i.imgur.com/3qM30yv.jpg)



Not too many pictures, but it gives a good view of what's possible. (And I slacked off a little sometimes).

For those of you who are curious, I didn't follow the diet of the program however, I did change my diet. 
I got rid of all the junk (pop, cheese, cookies, ice cream) and only had 2 ice creams and 2 cookies the entire 90 days. 
I cut back my dairy intake by a significant amount and only had one glass of skim milk every dinner. 
I consumed A LOT more protein than normal and had a protein shake everyday (no I didn't purchase the ones from p90x. Simply bought a protein powder). Also, I drank water constantly throughout the day.

I started the program weighing in at 171lbs and now weigh approximately 157lbs.

Here's mostly what I ate:

**Breakfast:**  

- 1/2-1 cup egg white

- 2 glasses of water

- Whole wheat toast

**Snack ~10:00am:**

- Broccoli, cauliflower, carrots

- Some turkey or chicken

- More water

**Lunch:**

- Chicken or turkey sandwich with lettuce and carrots (the odd time fish)

- Coconut Greek yogurt

- Banana

- Water

**Snack ~2:30:**

- A little bit more turkey or chicken

- Soy beans

- Apple

- Water

**Dinner:**

- Was subject to a lot of things such as spaghetti, fish, chicken, random pasta with meat (make sure pasta is whole wheat) and then the odd time pizza, wings or burgers

- Sometimes brown rice

- Veggies!!

- Skim milk

**Night snack:**

- Soy beans

- Protein shake after workout

My dinner wasn't always the best option because I'm at home for the summer with my parents and I get off work to come home and eat what's available. For the most part though try I tried to choose meat and fish.

I go back to school at the end of August and I won't be continuing p90x however, I'm doing weight lifting now and also when I get back to school since I've lost some the fat I had. I'll continue to have a healthy diet as much as I can.

1- IT FEELS AMAZING
Seriously, once you finish, you feel like a million bucks.

2- You get it out of the day, you're done with working out already! Wow!

3- You'll feel alert &amp; energetic. (seriously, it's 9:00PM and I just did my second workout, still have a bit of energy!)

Cons:

1- Lose sleep
2- Hard to wake up (no shit sheeeet)

How to:
1- Drink a cup of water before bed
2- Put your tomorrow workout clothes by your bed
3- Put a water bottle next to your bed
4- Set your alarm
5- Be in bed at 10! (even so I manage to not sleep until 11:30 somehow)

Now, as soon as you wake up, PUT YOUR FEET ON THE FLOOR AND SIT UP STRAIGHT. DO IT!
Drink some water
Get dressed
Work out

Now this is the perfect way, and it won't always be like this so you'll have to resort to my new favorite:

:::bzzz bzzzz bzzz:::

&gt;Ugh, fuck no I will do it later, go fuck yourself

Come on man, it's good for you

&gt;No, seriously man we'll workout later, it'll be great

NO! I KNOW ME AND I'LL BE TOO TIRED

&gt;Well fuck you I'm sleeping

You think another hour sleep will do you any good?

&gt;Uhh

That's right, get up and go workout you fuck, sleeping won't do shit for you

&gt;...

You want to get results? You gotta work hard, and this means giving up a useless hour of sleep. GET UP AND GO

&gt; okay.jpg


This works wonders, always gets me up! Never have I stayed in bed to sleep more after I tell myself ""Will this really make me feel any less tired? My rhythm is out of order, and I probably will wake up in the middle of a cycle; not worth it""

TL;DR - Read it, I wrote this for you :(

Thought I'd make a throwaway account to share the results I had a few years ago, since I'm doing a fresh round and trying to ditch some fat that found its way back home.

As you'll see from my face, on Day 1 I was VERY unhappy to be taking pictures of myself and was skeptical of improvement on Day 30 (as I didn't yet have pics to compare.)

By Day 60 I was having a blast (again, pics will tell), as it was obvious that the program was working - plus, puberty! Chest hair at last! Only to be lost over the next 30 days.

Day 1 I was basically starting with knee pushups and didn't do a real pull-up until Day 45-60 or so. By Day 90 I was airborne during Plyo Pushups and held a one-minute Crane pose during Yoga by the end. Fun stuff.

Anyway, I think these results are more typical than a lot of what we see online, with guys who already pretty strong and mostly needed to lose fat and activate muscle.

I asked /r/P90X two months ago if it was a good idea to switch from P90 to P90X after only 45 days (before P90 phase 2) and I decided to give it a shot! 



Finally it was the best idea I ever had! I did not lose as much weight as I wished (10lbs in 45 P90X Days and 16lbs in 45 P90 days) but I have seen my belly to get more flat and I feel a lot more fit in general but after all, I am still disapointed with the moobs. They feel harder but it's still jiggly... I hope it will get better.



For the Diet, I only followed the maccros 50P/30C/20F for the 45 days and I found it very hard but I'm doing my best I try to lose a lot of bf%. I might switch to the phase 2 maccros for the phase 3 but I am not sure for now. Sometimes I feel I need more carbs due to less energy.



Please feel free to ask me anything about my process.

Here's the part that I'm going to focus on for my food program for the next 30 days. It made an impact for me tonight. Thought I was going to start tomorrow, and then realized I was just wussing out.  So, instead of getting ribs at a restaurant, (which is what I thought I wanted) I had an ahi tuna salad at home, which was GREAT.

Anyways, here's Tony's food program....it inspired me.  Hope it helps to inspire others as well.

YOU KIDS NEED A PLAN. ANYBODY WANT A PLAN RIGHT NOW? FREE OF CHARGE? NOW THIS PLAN IS SO SIMPLE IT’S GONNA FREAK YOU OUT! YOU HAVE YOUR PIECES OF PAPER AND WRITING UTENSILS READY? AT THE TOP OF A PIECE OF PAPER WRITE THIS; I, [WRITE YOUR OWN NAME] HEREBY DECLARE THAT I WILL FOLLOW THE TONY HORTON FOOD PLAN FOR THE NEXT 30 DAYS. I’M GONNA GIVE YOU KIDS THE HARD CORE VERSION NOT MODIFIED VERSIONS OF THE FOOD PLAN. OK, PICK UP YOUR PENCILS AGAIN.

1

FOR THE NEXT 30 DAYS I WILL NOT EAT WHITE BREAD OR ANYTHING MADE WITH ENRICHED FLOUR OR PROCESSED FLOUR SNICKERS BARS. DONE! OUT! GONE! BYE BYE! SEE YA LATER! NO MAS! SIANARA! GOT IT? GET IT? DO IT!

2

I WILL GREATLY REDUCE MY DIARY INTAKE. AND FOR SOME OF YOU NO MORE DIARY! GET IT? DO IT! NO MORE PIZZA WITH A TON OF CHEESE! NO MORE MILK! NO MORE ICE CREAM! GONE! OUT! GO BUY SOME ALMOND MILK OR RICE MILK. OR I’LL SMACK YA.

3

NO MORE CARBONATED BEVERAGES. NO MORE PEPSI. NO MORE COKE. NO MORE 7 UP. NO MORE SPRITE. NO MORE DR. PEPPER. NO MORE DIET PEPSI. NO MORE DIET COKE. NO MORE ZERO COKE. NO MORE MOUNTAIN DEW. NONE!

4

WATER AND TEA ONLY! IF YOU’RE A COFFEE PSYCHO, 1 CUP A DAY. SHUT UP AND DO IT!

5

AT LEAST 2 OF YOUR MEALS A DAY THERE’D BETTER BE VEGETABLES ON YOUR PLATE. 1 MEAL A DAY, THERE’D BETTER BE FRUIT. DO IT

6

HERE’S HOW YOU’RE GETTING YOUR PROTEIN. NUTS, BEANS, FISH, TURKEY, AND CHICKEN. THAT’S IT! SHUT UP AND DO IT! GET OFF THE RED MEAT FOR A WHILE. OFF! I DON’T CARE ABOUT LEAN RED MEAT. JUST GET OFF OF IT!

7

FOR THE FIRST 2 WEEKS OF YOUR 30 DAY PLAN WRITE IT DOWN! WRITE IT DOWN! EVERY MORSEL! “OH, BUT TONY, THAT’S SO HARD, IT TAKES TIME, WHAT IF I FORGET A PEN? WHAT IF I’VE LOST MY PAD OF PAPER TO WRITE DOWN WHAT I’VE EATEN? DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING IN MY SALAD? WHAT IF THERE’S AVOCADO, PEPPERS, MUSHROOMS, NUTS, IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF SALAD, DO I HAVE TO WRITE IT ALL DOWN?” SHUT UP YOU WHINY LITTLE BI*****! IF YOU WANT TO LIVE LARGE AND YOU WANT THIS MICROSCOPICALLY SHORT LIFE OF YOURS TO BE WORTH SHOWING UP FOR THEN YOU’LL MAKE A PLAN. Y OU’LL DO WHAT I SAY AND THINGS WILL BE GOOD! OR YOU’LL KEEP DOING WHAT YOU’VE BEEN DOING AND THEN YOU’LL JUST BE WHAT YOU ARE RIGHT NOW, OR WORSE. OKAY?

I finished up not this past Sunday but the Sunday before.  

Details:  

* starting weight:  227lbs (in boxers)
* pants size: 38
* finishing weight: 212lbs (in shorts, shoes, shirt, etc)
* pants size: 34, I think?  I haven't bought any new pants yet, as I'm starting a new round next week of classic.  My ""normal"" pants that I've worn for a while are all really loose on me.  It's a pretty good feeling.  I know the weight loss isn't all that impressive, but there was a LOT of fat that lost and a lot of muscle added, so all in all I'm pretty happy with it.  But I'm most happy with my waist line, it's not lying, you know?

No pics...yet, cause I do security/networking stuff for a financial firm and that ain't gonna happen at this time for lack of anonymity reasons, plus I'm not done yet.

Anyway, my strength has increased a LOT.  My flexibility has increased by 8"" from the initial fitness test.  (which is, pardon my language, FUCKING AWESOME! I was super-non-flexible before, now I'm like a half-Gumby)

I'm not done though, so this isn't about celebrating, it's about progress.  Next Monday I'm firing up the next round, and we'll see how things go from there.

The moral of the story is, if you just keep doing it, every day, no matter how hard it is, or how tired you are, or if you're sore, if you keep doing it.  Sometimes, it sucks.  There's nothing worse than getting stuck at work until midnight, 1am and knowing that you have to go home and bust out chest shoulders and triceps.  That's hard.  But SO worth it.

So yeah.  I'm gonna keep pushing play, and someday soon I'll be back down to 175-180lbs and in the best shape I've been in in a long, long time.  :-)",,False,,t5_2rmaw,False,,,True,t3_h84zq,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/h84zq/finished_up_90_days_about_a_week_ago/,

Well, I finally decided to commit to it. Tonight was my 4th day of week 1, and I feel great. I'm making sure to finish off each workout with some protein (scrambled egg, peanut butter, tuna fish) and plenty of water, and I'm not trying to match the pace of the folks on the screen. If they say 8-15 reps, then I shoot for a clean 8, and a few more if I can squeeze them in. So far I have yet to experience anything more than a little calf stiffness. This might mean I'm not trying hard enough, but after last time, I'm taking it easy.

Because of an uneven first week due to work related interruptions and social commitments I'm doing an extra week of phase one. 

Anyway, at around the day 12 mark my wife noticed that there were significant changes in my body already, after many failed attempts at weight loss I might ad, and decided  she wanted in on the fun. One look at the P90x workouts and she was intimidated so I suggested Power 90 might be a better fit. After seeing some youtube results videos for both programs she was hooked. 

We live in Japan and her native language is Japanese, so she was a bit nervous about doing the program in English. As luck would have it there is a Japanese translation of both P90X and Power 90 (the Power 90 version has subs and dubs available). It arrived yesterday and for the last two days Tony Horton has been putting us through the paces upstairs and downstairs. With the thin walls of Japanese apartments, I'm pretty sure our neighbors are going to hate us even more than they already do!

Not really sure what the point of this post is, except to say that we love these programs!

I wasn't expecting it to fit since I had tried it on about a month and a half ago but I decided to give it a shot anyway. To my surprise it did fit. I couldn't believe that after 3 years of not being able to fit just 5 weeks was what got me into it. Now that doesn't mean I've lost all the weight because I haven't but it is a huge milestone and a reminder that it is working even if I don't see changes. This has gotten me soooo pumped for Monday's workout as I'm starting week 6 and I hear that's the start of when you really start to see results!

Every time someone posts in this subreddit asking how to gain mass with P90X the top comment is usually how the poster should change to a program like Starting Strength and many of you people all upvote it.

Look I have nothing against Starting Strength, I have read about it quite a bit and its an excellent **weight lifting** program.  That's right, it's a **weight lifting** program not a **body building** program.  **Starting Strength is designed to maximize strength gains not hypertrophy!**.  At only 5 reps per set any hypertrophy that occurs is incidental.  [Here, I will let Kai Greene explain why this is not what you want for mass gain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8wZNGL4iA4).  A better recommendation would be any of the routines freely offered at [bodybuilding.com](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/forumdisplay.php?f=8). I like [The Kris Gethin DTP MASS Trainer videos](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=146947923)

Of course that is not what the posters are requesting.  [It is possible to gain mass with the right diet](http://teamripped.com/my-nutritionsupplements/my-bulking-diet) and a modified P90X routine and we should be answering that question with a link like this one: http://howdoigetfit.com/how-do-i-get-fit-post/p90x-and-gaining-mass-beyond-p90x-classic/

If you really feel its necessary for the poster to perform a totally different program I think that the best choice would be **[Body Beast](http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/body-beast-workout.do)** since it is a Beachbody DVD based program just like P90X that is dedicated to hypertrophy and requires almost all the same equipment as P90X.  Dumbbells, a pull up bar, and a stability ball are all that are required with Body Beast.  I feel that it is safe to assume that anyone already doing P90X is attracted to working out at home not in a gym and I also think most people who already have the equipment necessarily for P90X don't want to invest a grand in plate weights, barbells, squat racks, and benches if they don't have to just for the pleasure of doing Starting Strength.

**TL;DR - Recommend [this](http://howdoigetfit.com/how-do-i-get-fit-post/p90x-and-gaining-mass-beyond-p90x-classic/) to posters asking how to gain mass with P90X.  Maybe tell them about [this other beachbody program](http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/body-beast-workout.do) but don't recommend a power lifting program not dedicated to hypertrophy like Starting Strength since it is a poor choice that requires a gym membership or a ton of money and space for the equipment.**",,False,,t5_2rmaw,1348561291.0,,,True,t3_10fw8e,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/10fw8e/psa_stop_recommending_starting_strength_for/,

When I did P90X last summer, despite looking everywhere, there was no dedicated P90X app. I personally do much of it at the gym with an iPod, so it just seemed natural... so a few months later, here we are with [Panda90X](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/panda90x/id439568723). 

Basically, this lets you track weight, reps, modifications and ""how it feels"" for the upper body workouts. For the cardio-centric days, you can keep track of modifications, if necessary. This plus weekly weight and photo tracking (for devices with a camera, duh) can be reviewed at any time and also shared to facebook and twitter. 

That's about it in a nutshell. We would love some feedback, we think it could really be useful for a lot of people and help to keep people on track.

Thanks!

**Edit:** Oh, and by the way, this utilizes the classic schedule; we may add the options for lean and doubles if there's enough demand, but we figured the vast majority of people follow classic anyway. 

**Edit 2:** Thank you everyone for the support and feedback! We'll try to address all the issues and suggestions in an upcoming update that should be out and ready within the next couple of weeks! If you feel so inclined, reviews and ratings on iTunes would be welcome as well! :)

**Edit 3:** Based on some feedback, there's been some confusion on the picture issue. While we seem to have omitted an initial picture, pictures are scheduled to take place at the end of every week (X Stretch/Rest day) to keep the intervals regular. The picture page is mainly for reviewing the photos and progress. We'll make that distinction a bit more clear in the future.

http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/1gkhrs/progress_so_far_through_day_67/

Overall I am happy. My diet still needs work and I finally have been starting to make better choices overall. I never had a horrible diet, but it definitely needed some fine tuning. 

I ended up losing inches but not weight. Partially because of diet. I did lose 3% body fat so I am now 24% body fat which is awesome. Here are inches lost

* Chest 0.5 inches
* Breasts 2.5 inches
* Waist 1 inch
* Hips 1 inch
* Biceps .75 inches
* Thighs 1 inch

One thing I would highly recommend is a pull up assist band. I was doing chair assist then negatives and I just didn't feel like I was getting the right work out. I got the pull up assist bands off amazon and it was absolutely amazing. I didn't get those until the end of this round so I am guessing the results are going to be quite different next time around.
Other random things


*  I didn't do kenpo, I did either a cardio kettleworks video or I worked out with a trainer on a power plate.
*  I am like a million percent stronger and feel much better
*  I think I have abs again!
*  I started subbing in ab ripper 2 (I think it's easier) to change things up near the end of phase 3. I just needed a change.
*  I plan on using this week to try out P90x2. I don't know if I'm ready but I am not sure if I can take another round of P90x without a break, and variety is the spice of life.

Take this friendly advice, if you will.",31,4,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/tj7hf/beginners_failing_hard_at_plyometrics_dont_worry/,"If you do a search for ""plyo"" on the side bar, you will notice a trend:

http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/search?q=plyo&amp;restrict_sr=on

Pretty much everyone hates plyo. A lot. There is a post by me in there somewhere as well (granted that I have been posting a lot lately). Last week, I failed MISERABLY at plyo. I maybe made it 35-40% of the way through, and that is being generous to myself. That made me very mad, and it came time for me to do it again today.

I made it all the way through.

How did I go about doing this, you ask?

Allow me to create a bulletted list for you, if I may:

* As is said all of the time, ad infinitum here, DO NOT try to keep up with Tony and the Kids if you are unable, which you probably are unable at this point. There is absolutely no shame in that. Find your own speed for each exercise and go. You don't have to match them because, quite frankly, they are in a lot better shape than any of us beginners (more than likely).
* Do **NOT** feel like you need to do every set for the full amount of time. Someone on this board gave me that advice and it worked beautifully. Say a set is 30 seconds long. Some sets that focus on moves that I am currently struggle with got knocked down to 20 seconds for me. I told myself that that was my goal. Occasionally I surpassed it, but I DID make it to my goal every time. Your goal might be 15 seconds for now. That is fine. Like Tony says, modify, modify, modify. Speaking of which...
* **MODIFY!!!!!!** See Pam the Blam right there? **[redacted with apologies]** The female on the right. Watch her. She is giving you modified moves to do in case some of the moves are too intense/too high impact for you at this point. I used some of those modified moves. When I used them, I would personally try to complete the whole time for the set, but a combo of modified moves+less time may be what some of you need, and that is fine.
* Just to reiterate a point that Tony makes constantly, land softly on your toes. You could easily get some damage otherwise (shin splints, anyone?)
* This one was probably the most important one for me. Pause the video. It is okay to do that. I tried to pause as little as possible during the actual exercise, but I would make my water breaks about twice the length. Occasionally I found that my heart rate was too high, so I'd do some ballistic stretching to get my heart rate down a little bit. Then I'd get right back to it. The important thing is to keep on going!


I am probably forgetting something, primarily because I am completely spent. That being said, know that you CAN finish plyo! Pace yourself, modify frequently as needed, and you will be able to make it through. More than anything, you have a fantastic morale boost afterwards. Next week, I am going to go for 25 seconds instead of 30 in some areas, and I'm going to try to modify less moves. My goal is to be able to do the whole thing as I enter phase II. This DOESN'T mean I want to keep up with them just yet. I just want to be able to make it through without any pauses.

I started working out May of 2011. At the time i weight 210 lbs. My friends did insanity and i decided to join there group. I wasn't satisfied yet so after the 2 months of insanity i did another round myself. Again i wanted more so i started doing p90x for 3 months and then another 3 months.
My current weight is 170lbs, 6'1,age 19
In the beginning of my journey i only did cardio (insanity). After finishing insanity, i got to 180lbs. At the end of two round of p90x i reached 170lbs. I didn't really follow the schedule nor nutrition plan. I just did resistance days and ate whatever but i would never stuff myself to where my stomach would feel uncomfortable. The only cardio i got when doing p90x was playing basketball every now and then. Now that im done with my second round of p90x(8-10 reps), i want to start cutting (12-15 reps). Hopefully i can get what i want by this summer and i am going to try to do some cardio and stick to a diet.
hope you enjoy the pics since reddit loves cats so much.

I used to be the one who'd be sober at the end of the night and if I did drink to get drunk, I'd have one fuck of a tab by the end of it.

Also, I used to be able to eat a crap-load of food without feeling a thing.

Today was my cheat day so I figured 'screw it' I'm going to have a real cheat day for once (instead of just having a tiny bag of chips or something). For lunch I decided to have a Whopper and damn! Not only did it taste awesome (eating limited salt/fat then going to a Whopper... Glorious) but it actually made me feel 'full'.  I felt full all afternoon too.  That's never happened before.  

I'm 66 days into my first cycle of p90x and even 2 months ago I'd have eaten that Whopper, fries, full drink and a 'snack' burger for lunch... and MAYBE felt full...

Then tonight I went out for beers with a buddy.  Normally I'd drink all night without even getting buzzed.  But tonight, 2.5 pints in, I'm really feeling it.  Like, my head is swimming.

Holy damn.  

I finished Pint #3 and I was done.  My total bill for the night? $15 after tip.  WTF!? (Normally it'd be around double that or more... often with barely a buzz to show for it).

Anyway - for all the talk about getting trim and such, I just wanted to pipe in with some positive real-world ramifications for my p90x workouts.  I'm still a bit buzzed as I write this, but I feel good.

Initial thoughts...",30,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/179712/8_days_off_the_smokes_2_days_on_p90x_initial/,"So, today marks day 8 of no smoking (easy going this time, gonna make it for sure).  And day 3 of P90x is tonight.  Here’s my initial thoughts, but first some background.

In August of 11, I quit smoking after 20 years and started working out.  I started in at 175 lbs, 32 BMI (yeah, fat bastard, not a stitch of muscle).  By December of 11 I was at 200 lbs, but my BMI had dropped to 28.5.  So, LOTS of new muscle, lost some fat (but probably gained some from quitting smoking).  My routine was a 3 times/week 30 min light cardio followed by strength training (bars, bells, squats, etc…)  Basic stuff, nothing INTENSE.  I couldn’t bench 75lbs the first day, but by December I was benching 100lbs 3x12.  So some serious gains, but no real mass.  I was trying to get healthy.

Fast forward a year, and I was back on the smokes (like a sucker) and quit working out. But my diet has VASTLY improved (Read: no more Cheeseburgers every lunch, or not eating 2 burritos at Chipotle).  Finally convinced my wife to quit smoking with me and work out so we don’t gain 20lbs of Ex-Smoker fat.  So, a week later, we’re off to the races!  I always wanted to do P90x and this was my chance.  If we do it together, we’re more likely to finish. Here are my thoughts so far:

**Day One**:  Chest and Back - Can’t do one unassisted pullup anymore (could do 1 in 2011) but was knocking out 12 per set of each type using a chair, doing about 10-12 of most push-ups (though those frackin’ diamonds limited to 4-5).  Did good overall, didn’t quit, but couldn’t do ANY of the Abs.  LITERALLY couldn’t do one sit up, I was so blown. Drank a protein shake and went to bed.  DOMS not bad, just tired as hell, arms are a bit sore today, more than yesterday.  Core is nice and tender, so while I couldn’t do Abs, I know my Pushup form was correct.  The only down-side to the Day One workout was that the serpent pushups (“under the fence” ones) were impossible for me on set 2.  My shoulders and hips kept “popping” and hurt too much to do. Joint pain, not muscles.  So, I did one after the pop started and moved on.  My Day One self-Grade, “B”.  I did my best, and finished at least the first part of the workout.  Nothing to be ashamed of IMO.  I’m hoping I can get through at least SOME of Abs next week.  I’m sure I’ll do better.   My workout notes for this one is:  Go lighter on the weights!  (I was using 30 lbs for everything, and struggling at 7-8.  I need to drop weight and go light to burn fat.  Will worry about Muscle on Round 2).

**Day Two**:  Plyometrics - Yesterday was a WHOLE different story.  I’m thinking to myself, “Jump Training, I can do that, no problem.  I got strong legs, used to squat 185 lbs. in the gym.  Not an issue.  Did some research on it, watched some YouTube vids of people doing it. Plyo seemed like it wouldn’t be that hard.  I don’t know what all the fuss is about….

NOPE!  OMG, I couldn’t finish it.  I got 45 min into the program (2nd set of circle runs) and he wanted more jump squats.  NOPE!  I had to stop.  Just couldn’t do it anymore.  And I walk 1 mile to work from my parking garage, I need my legs man!  I NEED to walk up 4 flights of stairs instead of taking the Elevator.  I have a weight goal.  I have to exercise during the day, not just at night!  I made the call (after my wife collapsed on the sofa with a “NOPE!” 10 minutes earlier) that I’d stop.  I’m SOOO glad I stopped.  I couldn’t take it today if I hadn’t quit.  It hurts to poo man, IT HURTS TO POO!!!  I can’t stand up without assistance.  The walk to work was MURDER!  WOW that was intense.  Had no idea it would be that bad.  I have nothing else to say about yesterday besides, OUCH!!!  Maybe I should have had a protein shake again?  It’s mostly Cardio, so I didn’t think to drink one.  Just went and ate a HUGE taco salad (huge being a TON of lettuce, light cheese, ¼ cup homemade Guacamole, and light on the beef).  Legs are telling me I should have had the shake. My wife’s not doing much better.  She’s all kinds of sore today, so that’s good.  Misery loves company as they say.


Tonight, is Shoulders and Arms.  My Take-Away from Monday is that 30 lbs. is too much for this kind of workout.  Yeah, great for mass, bad for weight loss.  I’m thinking about dropping it to 20 lbs.  And as little as 8 if there are Lats. involved (my neck gets wrecked by lats. if it’s over 10 lbs.).

On the bright side, I’m too frackin’ blown to even THINK about smoking.  I cannot imagine even lighting one up.  So there’s that.

Gonna stick with the program and make it happen!  Get home, and hit play!

Last month I looked around the house for a doughnut-like pillow to help prop me up off my tailbone, and found a pair of thick flipflops (straps down) was perfect!    My hips rest on the foam, and the tailbone falls between them (no need for towel or pillow).

Second, he owns a boat. Tony asks Eric to tell the audience something interesting about himself. He says that he owns a boat. Tony says, ""Wow, the guy lives in a boat. Love that."" Boats... Green and blue.... Bandannas... Long, flowing hair... Starting to look like a pirate to me.

Lastly, I think it is quite obvious that he is fond of Sophia (and who wouldn't be?). He is always trying to talk to her and ""do huggers with your neighbor"" as he slowly works his way over to Sophia only to get the cold shoulder. However, a typical pirate in many minds alike is one with a parrot on the shoulder. What does Sophia do during Calf Raises when the ""toes are in like a pigeon""? She makes bird noises.

All in all it is a very good program except for one major issue.

The workouts are just too much and too long to be a sustainable exercise program over the long term. Working out intensely an hour to an hour and a half, six times per week is simply too much. It was a fun 'bootcamp' thing to do completely the first way through, but the volume of exercise is just not necessary even if you want to stay in a very fit state.

Beachbody programs in general, I've found, tend to follow this 'bootcamp' type way of working out. I'd really like to see a home workout routine that is designed to be done for many years.

Thoughts?

My first round of P90X was classic, but during phase 3, I had a lot of energy, and would sometimes substitute Insanity workouts for Kenpo, and sometimes I would do an additional Insanity workout after a resistance workout. 

My second round of P90X was a hybrid of insanity. I replaced ab ripper x for cardio/insane abs, plyo x for plyometric circuit/max interval plyo, yoga for cardio/max recovery, and kenpo for pure/max cardio. 

As far as diet goes, I didn't follow the diet guide at all. What I did was clean up my eating habits overall. I stopped eating junk food, and started eating lean proteins and complex carbs. I allowed myself to cheat about once a week, and also drank alcohol 1-2 times per week on average. 

Supplements:
During my first round, I tried to drink chocolate milk as often as possible as a recovery drink. I also took fish oil, animalpak, CLA, and green tea. I also took OxyElitePro in the mornings.
In my second round, I took the same supplements as the first round, but drank whey/procomplex from ON instead of chocolate milk, took Jack3d before workouts, sometimes BCAAs, and creatine as well. 

[Progress](http://i.imgur.com/18Ju2.jpg)

Taking pictures is crucial to noticing your results. Just looking in the mirror, I didn't see any changes, and often became discouraged that I had plateaud. 

I am currently recovering from a dislocated shoulder at the gym. I am hoping to start another round, being a P90X/P90X+/One-On-One/Insanity hybrid, and I also preordered P90X2. After that, I'm hoping to do Insanity, and then Asylum. I probably sound like a BeachBody junkie, but after dislocating my shoulder at the gym, I realized how much I prefer working out at home. 

edit:
I just finished designing a ""custom"" hybrid for myself to bulk up. 
I basically took out all of the cardio, and strategically placed workouts from P90X and One-On-One so that I get at least a day of rest between muscle groups. I guess I will update this thread again in 90 days! 

Update:
I just finished my 90 days yesterday, and started P90X2 today.

[Here are my latest results](http://i.imgur.com/hGRan.jpg)

I am a little disappointed. I probably ate too much, or didn't lift heavy enough. I went from 136 lbs in the Sept 2011 picture to 148. My body fat went up about 2-3% (and it is very noticable). I should've done cardio at least once a week to limit the fat gain. 

On the plus side, I definitely gained some size in my chest and shoulders.  I also didn't have any problems with my bad shoulder! My arms did gain a very small amount of size.

* P90X and Insanity

* P90X and TurboFire

* P90X and P90X One on One

To me this was really good timing. I've been wanting to do a hybrid of P90X for some time now, I just never actually got to it. Now I have no more excuses. I'll give you the link to get them in their original form in a moment. Why? Read on.

When you go to the Beachbody link provided below, you click on ""Print Worksheets"" for whichever hybrid program you're wanting. Neat huh? Well it would be if Beachbody actually made them readable, able to be written on, and easy on the printer ink. The file they want you to print is a jpg with horrible compression. Sure, you can use it, but it's bad. I've warned you.

Now what I've done is taken their program, throw it into Excel, then Word, and then Acrobat Pro to make them usable! The printing is clear, you can write in the spaces easier (yeah, it's still small; had to compromise somewhere), and it's easier on your ink. The only hybrid program I didn't fix was the One on One hybrid. I don't own that program so it's of no use for me. If you want me to do it, ask nicely, I'm sure I can.

Before workout: DYMATIZE XPAND XTREME

After workout: DYMATIZE ELITE WHEY + VYOMAX NUTRITION MAXI CARBS

**Progress**

I can't really see any significant improvements in the pics, but boy can I feel them. It seems my stomach is the last place I'll be losing weight, but it seems to me that the fat there is easier to grab on to; it ""hangs"" a bit more, than a gut would.

I can definitely feel my arms are bigger, more toned and defined. I'm doing 8-10 reps as I'm going for size, I wonder when they'll grow.

For week 9, ""shoulders and arms"", I was able to really kick it up a notch. Made me feel like I haven't been giving my all with my dumbbells (even though I have). I look forward to pumping it up!

By FAR, my biggest improvement is pull-ups. When I started P90X I could do 0 pull-ups... and I could do 0 negative pull-ups... yay me. I did assisted ones, moved on to negatives when I could and today (day 61) I just did ""legs and back"" and did 70 normal pull-ups total!

Something I never thought I'd ever achieve to be honest. I just finished my workout for today, and thought I'd throw in an update on my situation.

Little background info: I was a fatty. No, not a fatty, a fat fuck fatty boom baladdy. My entire life I've been overweight. For the most part, I haven't cared. I haven't wanted to change myself because if I didn't care, why should anyone else? I'd get called names here and there from my brother, and some friends who would be joking around with me, but I always was hurt by it. But I never wanted to do anything about it. I'm fine the way I am, and they're just cruel human beings. I was never popular with the girls (I wonder why) and always just assumed it was because girls were shallow, and they should want me for my personality (haha!). Then it happened. I met a girl. We fell in love. It was perfect. She loved me for who I was and not my body, how can it get any better! Then.....she dumps me. She's no longer physically attracted to me, and she can't be with me any more. Who knows, maybe she was cheating on me, but that's besides the point. She left. I'm alone. Well, not alone....I still have my fat ass to comfort me.

Life is different. Suddenly I'm aware of how my man boobs poke out through my clothes. How wide my waistline is. How all of my clothes are incredibly baggy. How much I hated looking in the mirror and how every time I would walk by one I would look away. I despised looking at facebook photos with me in them because I absolutely hated the way I looked. I was so sick of myself that I couldn't take it any more. I looked at weight loss tips online, in books, asked my friends, and nothing seemed to peak my interest. Then a friend of mine mentioned the P90X. ""P....90.....?"" I remember asking my friend. And he gave me his workout set up, advice on how to get started, and off I went. 

I cleaned my kitchen from junk food. The bbq chips, the chocolate chip cookies, dr. pepper, pepsi, everything. I put them in a bag and gave them to my friends to split amongst themselves (waste of food to throw away haha). I bought new running shoes, new bands, new weights, a yoga mat, and I hit play.

First day wasn't so bad. I can do this. Man, I'm a lot stronger than I thought I thought I'd be. This isn't going to be so bad! I'll be in good shape in no time! Then.....plyometrics. I'm not gonna lie. I hit pause after every exercise. My legs were on fire, I was breathing hard, I wanted to give up. I stopped the video. Said fuck it, went to my room to get changed, and opened my dresser drawer and saw a note my ex girlfriend had written me previously. I won't tell you guys what it said, but it left me in tears. Not because of what it said, but at how hurt she had left me. That was the push I needed. That ignited my heart man, the catalyst I needed to really become someone new. I ripped it up, wiped away the tears, and hit play. 

I still remember laying on the floor after plyometrics. I was in pain. My legs hurt, my chest hurt, my body was exhausted and I was feeling it. But nothing, and I mean nothing, hurt more than the heartache I was feeling. Every day I would hit play. Every god damn day was a struggle. Every day I would lay in my bed after a workout, too sore to move, and just have the tears roll down my face. 

Let me just say this now guys (and girls). For anyone thinking of giving up, don't. Just don't. You want to get in the best shape of your life? Work for it. Nothing in this life comes free. The only currency to exchange for a healthy lifestyle is blood, sweat, and tears. Only if you're willing to sacrifice those will you be able to achieve the body you want. 

I'm 2 months in. I've hit play 60 times. I couldn't be happier. I feel better, I look better, and I've achieved something that I never thought I'd ever have: Confidence. I'm down 55 pounds, and I can't tell you how different my life is. I'm wearing clothes that I never thought I'd fit into, I'm dancing in clubs with my friends, I have women approach me and flirt with me, I've gone on more dates in the past month than I have in my entire life all together. But nothing feels better than looking in that mirror and loving the person that looks back. That man that I would avoid just looks back at me now and has the biggest smile across his face. 

I have 30 days left, and I will enjoy every single workout. Once my 90 days are up. I'm going to take a week off, and then start round 2. Keep going guys. Just keep hitting play. Taking breaks, giving up, quitting, you're only cheating yourself. This program isn't easy, but man oh man is it worth it. Whether you're trying to bulk up or lose weight, you're going to love who you are at the end, but only if you try your best. 

That's my little story. Just thought I'd put it out there. Perhaps I'll drop in again after my 90 days are up and post my before and after pics. But until then. I'm going to keep hitting play. I hate it...but I love it.

I just want to say too that if your reading this and you haven't started p90x, do it.  It doesn't matter if you can only do a half a pull up and 2 push ups.  In plyo tony says, ' do what you can, as long long as its your best'.  That is the truth, if its only 2 push up, soon you will be able to do 4, then 6 then 8.

Here's a roundup of my experience with P90X.  I started the program for the first time about two years ago and had to stop at week 8 due to an unrelated injury.  In that time I went from 175lbs to 160lbs, building some muscle and shedding some fat.  I loved the results I'd gotten so far but let other priorities take over and didn't resume the program after I healed.  I went about a year without working out and kept off most of the weight I'd lost.  Unfortunately there are no progress pictures for this round.


I finally got my motivation back in a big way earlier this spring.  Started up again at 167lbs on April 3rd and made it through about day 75 before some unavoidable obligations and travel plans forced me to take a few weeks off.


I was ready to start phase 3 over and finish strong, but to my delight, my girlfriend decided she wanted to do P90X with me, so I gleefully made the decision to stop this round early and start again from day 1 with her at my side.


As such, I figure it's time to put up the progress pictures I'd been saving.  The pictures titled ""round 2 - day 1 _____"" are equivalent to ""round 1 day 75-plus-three-weeks-off"".

Starting weight 167lbs.  Current weight 155lbs.

Certain videos (AbRipperX comes to mind) I think I would probably benefit because I would take more breaks and make sure I do 25 instead of just switching when they switch in the video.  Pausing and playing constantly gets cumbersome on AbRipperX

I think I could still tolerate him for a few days a week, Kenpo/Plyo I can watch it on mute and just keep up, and Yoga (I'm actually replacing it with YogaX2) I think I can tolerate listening to since he stays pretty calm.

Obviously I've already convinced myself that I'll at least try to do this, I'm just curious if anyone else has tried this as well and how it worked for you.

I've done the program a couple times (each a little different). First time I didn't do the diet. Second time I didn't do the workouts everyday (my schedule was crazy at the time). Third time I did it the way it's suppose to be. 

So, here is what I learned + some tips. 

The Workout

* Do yoga. As much as so many people hate it, power through it. If it's boredom for you, push through that and see it as another challenge (like lifting a blank-pound weight is a challenge). If it's too tough (you're not flexible), keep at it. You'll notice huge changes in 6 weeks, and you'll be glad you powered through.
* Quality over quantity. Tony says it all the time, but through the three times I've done it, if I focus on my form more than my numbers... I can TOTALLY see a difference in my figure.
* Don't be afraid to press pause. Don't do it a lot. But if you need to, do it. 

The Diet

* Do the diet. It really makes a difference in your body shape. Almost everyone who has completed the program will agree.
* String Cheese: put it in the microwave for 20 seconds. It tastes better melted and you get rid of some of the oil. Win-win.
* If you can, cook a bunch of food at the beginning of the week (on Sunday for me). That way you don't have to slave every day trying to make sure you're eating correctly.
* Egg Whites: Don't get Egg Beaters. Get a carton of Egg Whites. Actually, get a lot of them. This will save you so much time and tastes really good (insanely better than Egg Beaters)

Random

* Get the bands so if you end up traveling, you'll still be able to do the workouts. You can get fairly cheap ones.
* Drink a lot of water throughout the day. It's good for you!

Now your turn. Let's share! I'm going to do it again before p90x2 comes out, and I'd love to hear what y'all got.

The physical changes here at the 1/3 mark are pretty minimal, but the mental changes are astonishing. I used to be in great shape, wrestler in high school, etc., then all that shit went out the window when I started college. Ten years of booze, weed, and cigarettes later, I was a goddam wreck. I'd been thinking about P90X for a while, but never had the motivation or the time. Recently, I changed jobs and moved to the mountains to start over, but old habits have a way of following you around. I'll spare you the details if the tipping point, but to make a long story short, 30 days ago I made the decision to *commit* to rebuilding myself and my life. Part of that was starting P90X and more or less following the nutrition plan. I'm not with the diet 100% but I am trying, and I am eating way better than I used to.

Since starting the program, I have more energy, I look and feel better, I feel more confident, and every aspect of my fitness has improved dramatically. I've had a series of physicals for my new job, so I also got to see my blood pressure drop sharply and my resting heart rate has also slowed. My scale weight has stayed pretty much the same, but my body fat is disappearing. I have started hitting the bags again, and when I finish P90X I am hoping to start training for boxing and maybe even MMA down the road.

TL;DR  P90X is awesome and 30 days in, it has already helped me change my life.

First thing you need is a chair.  Bring the chair up to slightly behind (or in front) of the pullup bar.  Stand up on it and instead of doing a pullup set your palms facing you to do a chinup on the bar.  Grab hold of the bar in that fashion and let yourself down as slowly as you can after taking your feet off the chair.  Wait a few seconds and do it again.  We are not pulling up, only attempting to slow how fast we drop.

When you are able to fully control the descent switch to the normal pullup grip.  If you are having trouble with your grip you may either way to try some chalk (cheap to get) or some hand straps (also cheap to get).  I recommend chalk unless you have a weak grip.  If you have a weak grip you can fill up two 5 gallon buckets with water and just hold them for as long as you can once per day going for more time each time.

When you can control your descent on the pullup you are ready to try your first true pullup.  You may find you can only do one to three.  That's ok.  If you can only do one, wait 15 seconds, then try for another.  If you are still having trouble doing your first pullup rest the toes of one foot on a chair as you do it. That should stabilize you enough to finally do it.",,False,,t5_2rmaw,False,,,True,t3_tn13z,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/tn13z/how_to_do_your_first_pullup/,

(I didn't take any back pics on Day 1, so I added two Day 90 back pics.)

Finished Day 90 this morning! I'm happy with my results, but I went in deciding I wasn't going to follow the nutrition plan because (for better or worse), a lot of my world revolves around good food. I did try to be mindful about what I ate, but I didn't change my eating habits that much, besides eating more often. (Breakfast, Lunch, Snack, Dinner.) So my results were not as dramatic as they could/should have been. 

I'm also a bad P90X-er and never took the fit test at the beginning, and I don't own a scale, so it's hard for me to quantify the changes. I don't think my weight changed at all (if anything it went up a pound or two with the gained muscle), but I went from being able to do 0 wide-front pullups to being able to do 5, which was pretty cool.

Overall, I had a surprising amount of fun with the program, and will probably start on P90X2 after the holidays.

A quick summary of what I thought of each workout:

* Chest &amp; Back: A good workout, but a little repetitive for me. I think dive-bombers are really fun, though.
* Plyometrics: I have a weird love/hate relationship with Plyo. I felt like puking during it, but felt really good about myself when I was done. In some ways, it was my favorite workout.
* Shoulders &amp; Arms: Another favorite workout. Lots of variety and no pullups!
* Yoga X: Glad it was included, but I thought it was too long, and a little gimmicky. The last 2 sessions I did P90X2 Yoga and thought it was much improved: only 1 hour, and much more basic (but not easy!)
* Legs &amp; Back: My least favorite workout because it was really hard. Soooo many pullups, and Ab Ripper X was much harder after all the leg work.
* Kenpo X: I fell in love, then out, then back in love with Kenpo. I got bored with it during Phase 2, but during Phase 3 I tried hard to really push myself during Kenpo and it got fun again.
* Core Synergystics: I wish someone had warned me that this workout is tough. I thought that since it takes place during the recovery week it would be easy, but the first time through wrecked me. Now I really like it.
* Chest, Shoulders, &amp; Triceps: Another fun one with lots of variety and no pullups. :)
* Back &amp; Biceps: Katie. Someone shut her up. My biceps felt like they were going to explode by the end.
* X-Stretch: I did X-Stretch about 75% of the time, and took a real rest day the other 25%. It was fine, but I thought it could have been 30 or 40 minutes instead of a full hour. The Dreya Forearm Stretch made me giggle when he told us to imagine squeezing something in both hands...
* Ab Ripper X: Then_He_Said's recommendation to pause and make sure I did 25 reps of each exercise completely transformed my Ab Ripper X experience. I made gains much more quickly, and by week 8 or 9, I could go through the whole workout without stopping. It's still hard, though, and I collapsed in pain at the end of the Mason Twists every time.

I've gone from doing 100% knee push ups to nearly 100% regular push-ups, I've been using bigger bands, etc. But I started P90X for two main reasons 1) to get closer to having a hot bod and 2) to get better at running without having to run in the cold (or worse, on the treadmill that much). 

Tonight, I was itching to run. I have a 5k race in May and I wanted to make sure the cardio in P90X was sufficing and keeping my heart in race shape. (Disclaimer: I'm not a ""racer,"" I just try not to walk whenever I do a race, whether the distance is 5k, 10k, or when I get up to 10 mile--i.e., I'm slow). So I went to the gym to do a 2-2.5 mile run on the treadmill just to see where I was.

Before P90X I did 2 miles on the treadmill at a 3.0 incline. I was sweating it at a 12-minute mile.  But tonight, it was amazing. All of a sudden I'm at 3.0 incline hammering it out at 10:30 a mile, and sometimes faster bursts for 2.5 miles no sweat. It was amazing. Now I have so much more motivation to keep going with the harder days (pylo, legs and back) and really push myself on the other ones. Just thought I'd share!

[Here's an album from around that time](http://imgur.com/a/yNz5J). 

At that point, I got a new job that made it very difficult to do P90x. My work days are M-F from about 7am-7pm -- doesn't leave me much time to workout.

So I tried Starting Strength, since it's a lot less of a time commitment. This was a bad idea.

You see, I  have a herniated L5/S1 disc in my lower back. I read online about some success stories of people with similar back problems actually getting benefit out of the squats and deadlifts that Starting Strength emphasizes.

Unfortunately, my back didn't appreciate the compression heavy weights put on my vertebrae. On the plus side, I have gained some strength in my chest and shoulders from all the benching and pressing I've been doing.

But I don't think I look as good. I've gone from 160lbs to 175lbs because Starting Strength says to eat a lot. I think it shows, too, and not in a good way! [Here's an album from today.](http://imgur.com/a/0WKhS)

So today I fired up the ol' trusty P90X Ab Ripper X DVD, just to see how I could perform. It was terrible. MY core strength is probably at 50% at what it was at my peak of doing P90x. 

So I'm committing here and now to getting back in it with Tony. I'll have to fit it into my day. I'll eat dinner on the ride home from work or something :)

Thanks for reading, and wish me luck!

I'm going to throw my opinion out on the matter: I think that ab ripper x before your non-ab routine is a bad idea. 

Here's why:

First, and pretty obvious, P90X was designed in a manner where ab ripper x comes after the non-ab workouts. 

While constructing it this way, I'm sure Tony Horton had some good reasons of his own to structure it this way.

Second, I am almost positive that shredding your abs apart with ab ripper x and then lifting weights, doing pull ups, pushups, or using the bands will impact your form. You utilize your core for a lot of these exercises as it is. After a hardcore ab workout like ab ripper x, your effectiveness will decrease. 

You don't use your core as much on the non-ab routines, meaning that you won't have restrictions brought on by doing ab ripper x before these workouts. This will lead to you preforming at a higher level. THEN you finish off strong with ab ripper x! 

Anyways, I just felt like throwing it out there. Feel free to disagree with me, or not. The choice is yours!

I recently moved back in with my family after having a motorcycle accident last year and decided I wanted to use this opportunity to get into the best shape I have ever been. I have always lived a fairly active lifestyle (hunting, hiking, swimming) but have never really done a workout routine, nor have I built any mass. 6 foot at about 130 lbs. I can do push-ups and pull ups but I cannot keep up with the pace they set in the video. Even doing the whole first day with knee push ups and band pull ups I was only able to get through about 40 minute of it before I had to call it quits.

I am not quite discouraged that I failed. But it seems that even doing the modified version of all those things I was still not able to complete it. I got P90X for free from my brother who got it for his birthday, and I can not afford to go buy a different program such as Power90.

My question is this, should I keep doing as much of the exercise as possible even if it means quitting 1/2 way through it doing modified versions, or should I just try and do some other exercise with the equipment I own and come back to it at a later time?

Generally following the meal plan.  Tracking calories using MyFitnessPal app, averaging in the 1800 cal/day range.

Breakfast: Shakeology with water and 2 ice cubes blended
Snack: P90X Protein Bar
Lunch: Salad with 7-8 oz of deli meat and fat free Ranch Dressing
Snack: GNC Whey Protein / Cottage Cheese or String Cheese
Dinner: 6-7 oz grilled chicken breast with 1-2 cups brocolli and P90X recovery drink after finishing the workout.

Used to be 175ish lbs in high school.  When I returned from deployment in Sept 2011, I was around 180-185 lbs.  Ballooned up to 210 lbs by Nov 2012 due to too much alcohol during football season combined with not having time to work out while out to sea.  When I was back in port, I never cooked and meals typically consisted of Fast Food.

My ultimate goal is to get back down to the 170-180 lbs range.  Already saving a ton of money by finally cooking for myself.  Cooking a chicken breast on a Foreman grill only takes a couple of minutes and is easy enough.  I'm not too picky with food, so I don't need to spice it up with lots of flavors or sauce or anything.

There is some sticker shock with Shakeology that makes it seem like a ton of money.  But when it averages out to $4 per day for breakfast, I don't mind the cost.

I've generally been a member of the ""Kenpo is lame"" club. Coming from much more intense conditioning programs, and having a background in martial arts (years ago), I could work up a sweat with Kenpo, but the intensity was low compared to the lifting workouts and plyo. Moving at Tony and ""the kids"" pace just wasn't doing it for me, even doing kicks at eye level, plenty of footwork along with the punches, and bringing it for each punch.

Then, while cleaning my garage, I found my old hand weights, 2.5 lbs each. Wore them for the whole workout, and it was night and day. Took them off for the vertical punches at the end, and felt like I was in DBZ, my fists were moving so fast. I felt good and trashed at the end of the workout, and much more motivated to do Kenpo X again in the future!

Just do a search on amazon for ""hand weights"" or ""wrist weights"" for various options, if you want to give it a try. Mine are the velcro type, so I can do claw, sword/hammer, etc with them on. I've also got some ankle weights I found, but I'm not using them yet, since there's more potential for joint injury and overstretching hammies if you're not careful.

Yeah, and that reminds me. Don't do this if you don't have your form and speed down yet. Banging your joints sucks without weights. Throw weights on your wrists, and you are in MUCH higher danger of hyperextension, tendon and ligament damage, etc...Much much higher. But if you have good form, ease into it, and want to make Kenpo a lot more intense, this is one way to do it!",,False,,t5_2rmaw,False,,,True,t3_10ks9y,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/10ks9y/you_can_intensify_kenpo/,

These pictures were taken today which will be my fourth day in training block three.

I am happy with my results but I know that I could have done a little better.  The reason I say that is because I did have some times where I was not as strict on my diet as I was in the first month.  Even though I have had nutrition downfalls, I definitely see that I have lost body fat and starting to gain some muscle.  I will be focusing hard on my nutrition and make some adjustments for training block three.

Training Block#3 Adjustments

1. Nutrition - Fat Shredder to Energy Booster Diet - I am going to up my calories from 2,200 to around 2600-2800 with a 40/40/20 ratio.  So far I have been on the fat shredder 50/50/20 ratio for the first two training blocks and this will be my final week on it.

2. Increase water intake - I don't think I was drinking enough water and I have made it a big point to start drinking more water at least 64oz/day and that's on the low side for me now.

3. Utilize my BodyBugg - When I started on my fitness journey I bought a BodyBugg that came with a free 6 month subscription.  When it ran out I didn't bother using it.  I want to get the best results possible so I will be paying just for a month of the web service.  It's $10 but I think it will be well worth it because it keeps me accountable and I like seeing what calories I burn and at what times of the day.  It also has made me more active in walking around during the day at work.

Well after the TLDR here are the progress photos.  I have noticed that my right bicep looks bigger than my left bicep or maybe I just suck at flexing it.  Anyone have any recommendations on how to fight this problem?

I voluntarily entered a 90-day mental health/addiction treatment center 92 days ago. Physical activity was up to me. I'd let myself go physically over the last 2.5 years, as you can imagine an addict with mental health issues might have! I had a basic background of athleticism and weight-lifting, but nothing intensive. One of my fellow patients was undergoing the fantastic torment that is P90x and I decided to join him 4 days a week. I went from 210+ pounds to a stable 185 (6' male)  doing my best and forgetting the rest on the days I joined him (and making sure to eat properly). Light cardio on the other days. His progress has been even more drastic. I can't help but randomly allude to Tony on a day-to-day basis at this point.

If you take this program anywhere near seriously and stay motivated, and use the pause button deliberately as opposed to after every workout, you're going to get real results. Keep bringing it. I brought myself out of the physical funk I kept hoping I'd eventually bring myself out of thanks to the intensity and encouraging nature of this program. Enjoy.

I intend to go through the program again properly after a week or two off. Will do a before/after picture to see the results I get a second time around.

In the short time I have been doing this I have noticed the following things.

1. 
After the workout I'm not really tired at all, I'm usually pumped for a few hours afterward.

2.
When I wakeup at 5am to get ready for work I'm not sluggish and tired, I usually wake up with a lot of energy and it sticks with me through out the day.

3.
I have less of an appetite than I used to. Example being for lunch I got a normal sized salad with some grilled chicken pieces on top with a light dressing and normally I would be able to eat the whole thing, but today I could barely eat half same happened at dinner last night. 

4.
The final thing I have noticed that is changing and not to be weird, but my sex drive is through the roof. When I used to just be ok with once or twice a week, now I'm ready to go nightly which is totally different then just a week ago.

So thats is what I have noticed already changing and I'm wondering if these are normal changes for people that never worked out and then start? I'm not complaining just checking to see if other have noticed this.

I am actually on day 45 right now, I have just been procrastinating on posting these. I am getting out of a 3 year nursing program that just wreaked havoc on my body. My goal is to lose about 10 lbs but also to regain strength and tone up. 


Strength-
I am getting much stronger, I can almost do the entire Ab- ripper video where when I started I could only do about 15 of each move. On many of the lifting videos I am doing  12-15 lbs (for 13-15 reps). When I started I was using 8lbs - 10lbs. My weakest area is definitely pull ups. I barely can do reverse pull ups. I noticed this week I am able to start to control lowering myself down to a small degree, so definitely improving! 


Diet-
The first 35 days my diet was not good, I was suffering through my last month of school so I decided not to worry about the diet and start focusing on my fitness first and add in the diet. I am gluten and lactose intolerant so I in general eat ""heathier"" than the average joe. I can't eat fast food really, but I was not eating very good. I just switched this week to a paleo diet and I think this will have a significant change on my weight if not by day 60 photos, definitely by day 90. I realize many of you are very strict P90x diet followers, I just know by prior use of paleo if I am on it I will be in the 135-140 range on weight where now I am about 150 lbs. So that works for me.


Stats:
Weight has not changed significantly, but as I stated about diet was not optimized until just recently so I expect that will change. I'm about 150lbs and would like to get to 140. My height is 5'7 in case anyone was wondering. My day 1 measurements were: Chest (under breasts) 31 (day 30 31.5, not sure why this went up):, over my breasts 38 (day 30 36.5)""; waist 31.5(day 30 30.5); Hips 39.5 (day 30 39.0);  Left and right bicep 12.0 (no change day 30); and my thighs are 21.0 no change as of yet. 

Overall: Clothes are fitting better, I am feeling better (more like my old pre-nursing school self). This is a great program and I definitely will do more than one round. May be hard to keep up the regular schedule when I get a job but I'll work around it when the time comes. 
Also as a side note, I am highly un-photogenic and have never been comfortable in front of a camera (even when I was a 130lb 25 year old, lol) so these pics were the best I could do ;)

Height - 6' 2''

Weight day 90 - 154

Stuck pretty rigidly to the workouts, I must say I probably only completed the yoga a few times the rest I did something else, usually hiking or running. Towards the last few weeks I started running about 3 times a week subbing yoga and one other cardio exercise. I tended to work out 7 days a week, not 6 but this tended to be a game of squash or badminton on my rest day. 

Diet - I don't think I did one meal that was specified in the guide. I simply looked at the foods and distribution of carbs and proteins then did it myself through whatever I had. I stuck to a really low calorie intake of around 1200 calories with approximately a split of 40% protein, 45% carbs and 15% fat. This was maintained (rightly or wrongly) until the last few weeks of the program. I started eating a fair bit more for the remainder, typically around 2000 calories. Foods that worked really well for me, mainly because I am lazy, were egg white omelets, typically with a meat filling, special K or similar, Protein shakes (whey protein - around 8LB over the course of the program) and lots of grilled chicken. 

I realise in hindsight that if I had eaten a bit more when I should have I would likely have had more energy to build bigger muscles, particularly pectorals which look kinda weak. 

Going to carry on running now and working on my upper body with a very lean diet. I will however now be indulging myself to certain treats i.e beer and takeaway, once in a while.

I just finished up my first 90 days of p90x Classic. Here are my results:

...and since I realize I posed myself against a low-contrast background (i.e. I blend in far too well), here's a high-contrast black and white version of the first photo that gives you a better idea of what is going on:

http://i.imgur.com/ITcta.jpg

**Starting Stats:**

Height: 5' 9''

Weight: 170 lbs.

Waist: 35''

Chest: 36''

Upper Arm: 12''


**After 90 Days:**

Weight: 165.8 lbs

Waist: 31.5

Chest: 39''

Upper Arm: 13''

(Note: I may have measured my chest inconsistently. I think those particular results are actually less dramatic)

**Diet:**

I stuck to Phase I extremely closely, which was quite effective. Starting around day 45, I switched to a simpler diet which focused on maintaining a calorie deficit (&lt;2000 calories/day), while maintaining high protein intake (~170g/day). I found this fairly easy to follow, especially considering that I live in Hong Kong and a lot of my quick meal options tend to differ from what is available in the U.S.

**My challenges:**

Aside from fully-committing to the program, adapting the program to Hong Kong was interesting. I live in a 400 sq ft apartment, so figuring out creative ways to re-arrange furniture to do Dreya Rolls and Plyo was not without some difficulty. 

Losing that much off of my waist has been challenging too. Now nothing fits. Truly a first world problem. Then again, getting things tailored in Hong Kong is fairly cheap. 

**My motivation:**

I wanted to be in charge of my body. Before p90x, I had a beer belly that had no right to be there (I rarely drink!). I was just feeling weak. Since I started p90x, pretty much every aspect of my life has improved: sleep, concentration, energy levels, my job. I won't give Tony Horton all the credit in the world for any of that, because frankly, it was me who had to work my ass off for 90 days, but the Tonyisms certainly helped. p90x is a good starter program, one which I will likely continue until at least January. At that point, I may consider joining a gym to actually build muscle in a way that you cannot with this program.

I don't know if my results are anything special. Frankly, I don't care. I've got a lot more confidence now and I feel right inside my own body. 

Lots of room for progress though! 


Two other small notes:

1. I got a ton of those shorts at a stall in Mong Kok. Probably US$20 for seven pairs. That's why I have a different pair for each progress photo, haha.

2. I have no idea why I look progressively more tan as the shots go on. Maybe the confidence got me going outside more!",,False,,t5_2rmaw,False,,,True,t3_12ik2i,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/12ik2i/my_90_day_progress/,

**Me:**

Age: 20

Height: 6'1 ft

St. Weight: 150 lbs

En. Weight: 154 lbs

By the time I started the program I was able to do 25 push-ups, and 1 pull-up. By the end; I increased those numbers to 56 and 10 respectively. I wish I could increase my pull-up reps much more. I will certainly look more into that from now on. What surprised me the most was the flexibility progress. I have to thank Yoga for that. I know most of you guys hate Yoga, but once you look into every Yoga routine to improve your flexibility and push your limits, it will be the most beneficial workout of the program.

**Nutrition:**

For the first phase of the program, I had 300-400 calories below my TDEE everyday. I was eating lots of fruits, lean meats, whole grains. At the beginning of the second phase, I included peanut butter into my diet and I went for 500-600 calorie surplus. Finally at the third phase, I continued the program with LeanGains approach. 

That's all I did about nutrition. I never checked for macro but I see now that somehow I was always around %40/%30/%30 Carb/Protein/Fat. What I DID check though, was my daily protein intake. I never took less than 150 gr of protein per day.

**Supplements:**

* Optimum Nutrition %100 Gold Standart Whey
* GNC Salmon Fish Oil
* GNC MegaMen Multivitamin

**What I Would Change If I Started Again:**

* I would write down my reps and weights right from the beginning of the program. (Gives motivation.)
* I would go for failure at each set. (I feel it gives my muscles a better stimulation now.)
* I would do the whole program with LeanGains approach.
* I would use push-up bars right from the beginning. (Also gives better stimulation to muscles.)

**Thoughts:**

Last 90 days was the most awesome days of my life so far. I started this journay primarily to improve my phisique but it gave me much more than that. Being stronger, more athletic and more flexible than before feels amazing. Now I am thinking of doing a hybrid of P90X and P90X2 with the LeanGains approach.

Tony is really motivating and it was very satisfying after finishing and I feel great.

1. Focus. Tony says it, but I think the primary difference between last week and this week for me was my focus. I was way too distracted and frustrated last week.
2. Breathe! Deep breaths are calming, and calm is essential for YogaX. Last week, I was swearing. This week, I was silent, and breathing.
3. Your mantra should be ""Do your best. Forget the rest."" I know it's silly, but I think it really helped me. If something is burning too much, take a short water break, and towel off, and then slowly get back into the pose.

I've never posted my P90X results anywhere other than in my Team Beachbody profile.  I figured if it could possibly help or motivate someone, then I should share here:

http://goo.gl/tdUUC

These were taken after my first 90 days with P90X, which I completed about 2 years ago.  I was 31 and taking care of our 6 month old daughter.  I was tired, unhealthy, and full of excuses.  I cannot emphasize enough how much this program has changed my life and my perception of what it means to be ""fit"".  I am someone who generally had always felt pretty in shape, mainly because I have consistently played a lot of soccer and done a lot of running over the years.  And while I felt I performed pretty well at these things, I now often wonder how much better I could have been without the 14 extra pounds of fat I lost over these 90 days.

I didn't even follow the P90X diet plan exactly, but took a lot of it and applied it to building new habits.  I made basic, common sense adjustments to my nutrition.  I stopped putting sugar in my coffee.  I stopped eating stuff that comes in a box or a bag.  Besides a morning cup of coffee, I pretty much only drank water.  I ate pieces of meat that weren't bigger than the size of my fist.  I stopped eating late at night.  I stopped going back for seconds.  I subbed a salad for those delicious fries.  All these little things added up to make a huge difference.  But you know what?  I had a beer and a cookie every now and then too to keep my sanity.  Everything in moderation!

Today I'm even more focused on my nutrition and have completed many other Beachbody programs.  P90X changed my mindset not just towards fitness, but towards life.

I'm sharing this for anyone who feels stuck, in a rut, or is having a hard time ""pressing play"" today.  Seeing these kinds of posts here has kept me inspired and motivated, and maybe it can help you too.  No matter where you currently are in your fitness (or lack thereof) right now, know this: YOU CAN DO THIS.  Set your goals.  Don't just think of some in your head.  Write them down.  Come back to them every day.  Think about what your life will be like when you reach that goal.  Remember what you're committed to.  You'll have good days and bad days, but in the end it will all be worth it.  No matter what you feel like right at this moment, truly visualize how you will feel after your workout today.  You'll feel incredible and accomplished, so go get after it!

After being ~235lbs in high school I moved out and changed my eating habits. From '08 - '09 I went from 235lbs to 180lbs. I am 6'5"" and my fat has always been around my lower abdominals.

I had absolutely no muscle until '11 when I started working as a Valet attendant part-time. The amount of ~100 yard sprints to pick up and park cars put some muscle on my legs and increased my appetite. I was extremely wary about putting on fat and so started to look into proper nutrition.

Fast forward to today, and a combination of /r/seduction 'philosophy' and wanting to improve my self confidence has started to pay off.

This workout program has been more than adding muscle. Making the commitment to a 90 day program and then following through is a test of myself and I can say being 2/3 of the way through I definitely am going to do a second round and then when I can bust out like Tony I will move to Body Beast.

I'm a professional geek, and have never tried to follow a formal exercise plan in my life. Still, p90x seemed survivable. I only got 15 minutes into the first chest and back workout when part of my pulldown gear broke and I shot myself in the chest with a big piece of plastic. I managed to suck it up, get back on the horse and keep going (really nasty welt, though). I figured I'd skip the rest of chest and back and move on to ab ripper. I barely muddled through that, not even coming close to number of reps or proper form (leg crawl's about the only thing I managed to do right). Still, I felt good at actually getting in 30 minutes of exercise, and I could feel it. I hit the shower and went to bed, expecting to feel rough in the morning.

The problem is that I woke up around 3am Tuesday morning in the most intense aching ""pain"" I have ever felt in my life. My arms, my shoulders, my back, everything between knees to elbows... I've gotten beat up working in the yard or at school before and felt sore the next day, but this was nothing I'd ever felt before. My muscles felt... queasy, like your stomach gets with a bad flu. I was sweating like mad, but wanted nothing more than to stay under a pile of blankets, which I did for the better part of an hour, on the couch. I finally managed to get back to bed around 4, only to get up again around 6. I took a ridiculously long hot shower and started to feel better, but as soon as the water stopped, I started with the queasies again. Eventually it settled enough that I decided to tough out the day at work, and things gradually improved.

It is now around 1:30 am on Thursday, and the backs of my arms and shoulders are still so sore I don't have full range of motion. The queasies cleared up late Tuesday afternoon, but I have no interest in going any further in the program until I figure out what I did wrong. Did I just seriously overdo my day 1? Not enough fluids? I didn't have a ""protein shake"" or anything after I was done - didn't figure I'd done enough to warrant anything like that, just finished off my bottle of water.

Edit: 6 pm Thursday, and I just had to run two blocks to make sure I didn't miss my bus, so I guess I'm feeling better :D Thanks be to the hive mind for assuring me I hadn't done something unspeakable to myself other than being overconfident in my level of conditioning.",,False,,t5_2rmaw,1349388319.0,,,True,t3_10x7x7,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/10x7x7/day_1_and_wtf/,

-I will follow the nutrition plan laid out by Beach Body and my personal restrictions stated below:
 
What I will be giving up:  Alcohol, weed, soda, candy, junk food, fast food, burgers, burritos, pizza, sweetener in my coffee, chocolate covered anything, as much dairy as I can withhold, bad carbs, trans fat.
 
I will also be disdaining from alcohol unless it is during a business meeting when it would be offensive if I refused to partake in libations.  I will hold myself to this very strictly.
 
I have timed the start of the Challenge so the seventh day lands on a Friday.  Although I work long hours on Fridays I must do the stretch routine before bed.

I am also including my weight graph and day 21 pics because I wanted to show the ladies the weight they might gain during their menstruation. And I think I may be a little bloated the day I took the results pics.

I don't see much results yet but I am stronger and can do parts of the work outs I could not do before (i.e. deep push ups). The changes I did notice was my boobs are higher, I actually have some kind of an ass now, and I see my back muscles when I flex.

My breathing is more natural, I have better posture, I feel more mobile...it's generally great all around.

The main difference for me at least is that I couldn't stand Tony's voice during Yoga. I had come to associate that voice with the yelling and loudness that is so perverse to the ideal of yoga. If you're struggling, try finding a different home yoga video or see if there is a local class near you!

I've always had gym memberships and used them until recently, and I think the aspect that I would get annoyed at is not being able to integrate hard lifts (e.g. bench press) into my workout.  My question I suppose is, can you still build muscle mass the same way from P90X as you can by going to the gym and hitting the weights?

**Something that fits almost all exercises:**
At first you may feel your back getting more of a workout than your core. This will change as you progress. Just try and keep track of how many reps you can do before you have to break and increase it by 1 each time.  

Now for some specific tips.  

**In and Out, Bicycle(and Reverse)**:
At first you probably have your hands on the ground for support. I found if you start like this and want to push out just a few more reps, try raising them in the air over your head.  The change it form may make those last few a bit easier.  

**Cross legged/wide leg situp**:
I found that I couldn't do a cross legged situp yet, and on the way down on the wide leg my lower back would crack a few times. Not in pain, just the sound. I tried straightening my legs in front of me and no more crack on the way down.  Not sure if this defeats the purpose of this exercise, but I may try it like that some more until I can do cross legged better.  

**Scissors:**
This is where focusing on flexing properly really helped me. Try and keep those legs straight as much as possible, and focus on flexing  the feet/toes as well as flexing your abs. May take some of the pain from the back. I know ""just flex dude"" isn't really the greatest tip, so the one that helped me the most was trying to bring the top of my food towards me until I was focuses on the pain/stretch in my foot (and thus hamstring as well a bit) more than anything else.  

**V-up/roll-up:** At first these confused me so I didn't even attempt for a while. If you are having trouble with a certain exercise like this may I suggest just doing a plank for the duration. As your core gets stronger from other exercises, try it again. Another thing for this one. Try it on an off day, or before you start your core workout. You'll be able to do them more when your core isn't as tired and can focus on getting the exercise and form correct.  

**Oblique V-Up:** I still have a bit of trouble with this one. It can be awkward. You may also find you can do it on one side, but not the other as easy. This is another one where form and keeping straight is more important. At first I was bending my knees on way up, then on way down I would hear those cracks in my side again. So try and keep your legs straight and together and remember to keep them in front of you slightly. Try only bringing your legs up at first, or only bringing your shoulder off the ground so you can work out the kinks before bringing it together.  

**Mason Twist:**
For this one all I did differently was instead of starting with them and going to finish.. I waited until 10 reps in before I started. This way I got the motivation speech to keep me going at the end :)  

Hope this helps. If you have any questions or I was unclear about anything, let me know!

I've been lurking here for a really long time. I downloaded the P90X videos a long time ago, subbed here, and told myself I was going to get in shape. 

The videos have sat on my harddrive for months.

I had lost a lot of weight eating low carb/keto over the past year, but at some point I fell off the bandwagon and gained half of it back. 

I sat there feeling sorry for myself for a couple of days, but on my birthday I resolved to get back on my health/aesthetics bandwagon and correct my path. Sitting there feeling guilty wasn't helping me lose any weight.

I pressed play today, and had a difficult time following along with the video. I can't do any pullups, and by the second exercise my arms were exhausted. For the pullups I tried to hold as much of an ""up"" position as I could for however long I could. I would shake it out, rest, and see if I could do another hold. If I couldn't I would jog in place until they moved to the next exercise. 

I'm not ashamed to say I jogged through most of the last two exercises.

But I want to make a difference in my appearance, and I need to start doing something proactive. So here I am.

A couple years later, 30 lbs heavier and plus one child I'm ready to try and use P90x to get me back into the game.

I've been doing 45 minute sessions of stair-climbing to try and help me build up endurance again amongst using Convict Conditioning to help get my base back in order (can barely do 20 pushups right now).

My biggest concern is diet: my wife does all the cooking and she has a firm belief that 'it doesn't matter' what I eat -- meaning, she's not at all interested in supporting my efforts to change my eating habits (she also thinks that I won't see this through - though, to be fair, I have tried and failed to lose weight before).  

Now, all ramifications of this aside (she loves making white rice - primarily because it's cheap and easy), the reality of my situation is that we're not exactly made of money, so me buying all these P90x shakes, bars, massive amounts of fresh fruit/veggies etc is probably out of the question.

I figure what I'll do is try to limit my portion sizes even if I can't really control what's in those portions.  Limit my carb intake where I can and try to eat more protein (though protein is expensive and apparently eggs are bad for you again).

Supplement wise I've taken stock of what we've got lying around the house and I've got half a bottle of vitamin C, vitamin D, about 20 vitamin E capsules, a bottle of 120 Omega 3 fish oil capsules, a half-container of protein powder that expired last year (probably not useable...) and yeah... not much else.

I'm going into this with very little support on a few ends of the spectrum but I'm determined to see this through.

I've read that you don't 'need' the supplements/diet to finish P90x, you just would end it without looking as 'cut'.

I also read something about 'selective fasting' - does anyone know if that'd actually be helpful to someone in my situation or if it'd hurt me?

As of my weigh-in tonight I'm 230lbs, my doctor wants me at 180.  I'm of the mind that in order to get there I may have to amputate a leg... but I'm willing to put my best foot forward.

In smart phone app stores (iPhone for sure but not sure about Android,) there is an app called MyFitnessPal. It's essentially a food journal, and extremely easy to use. You enter in your info including goal weight, and since you're doing P90 tell the app you are ""very active.""

It will tell you the amount of calories you need to eat in a day and track your daily food logs as you input them to inform you what you need more/less of. You can search up foods and ingredients that you eat, as well as scan bar codes of packages. It will almost always have the nutrition info already stored in the app. It will progressively tell you how many proteins, fats, carbs, and overall calories you need to eat/avoid for the day, and it can also map your weight losses and gains. 

My favorite part of the app is the ability to tell you what percentage of your diet is prot, carb, or fat with its pie chart. An amazing ratio to have is 50% protein, 30% carbs, and 20% fats. I seriously recommend you do the math and log in on the computer to edit the amounts you need. 

For example:
Proteins and carbs have 4 calories per gram, while fats have 9.
I need to have 1900 calories a day.
1900*.5= 950, 950/4= 237.5 grams of protein I should have a day
1900*.3= 570, 570/4= 142.5 grams of carbohydrates I should have a day

While I'm only on day three of P90X, I'm about a week into the diet. As a Phase I, Level II (2,400 calories) following the standard nutrition plan, I'm having a host of problems.

Yesterday was a good example:

30% carb goal - I hit 32%
20% fat goal - I hit 36%
50% protein goal - I hit 32%

Problem 1: Every damn thing I pick up has carbs in it. Greek yogurt? 18g carbs. Pinto beans? 30g carbs. Even celery? 4g carbs.

So I'm guessing by now if I want a lot of protein, but no carbs, I just have to eat an ungodly amount of turkey, chicken, bacon, and eggs.

Problem 2: I'm eating a lot of high protein items, but still only eating less than half of what I'm supposed to be eating. Does a guy have to pound down a top sirloin every day to get to 283g of protein?

Problem 3: Which may not be a problem.. I'm ending up each day with uneaten calories. 350 I didn't eat on Monday, 1,072 I didn't eat yesterday, and I've still got 1,200 more to eat today and it's after 5pm!

I went all out and got the base DVD's, two sets of powerblocks, 2 yoga blocks, 2 sets of push-up handles.  Only one doorway pullup bar though, will that be an issue?  I'm thinking of picking up a pullup stand to go with it so we can both do it at once.

One thing I'm worried about is the first week's pain.  She wanted to start very ""light"" by just going for walks but that will go nowhere fast as far as results go so I got her to agree to this.  I know we will both be ridiculously sore and we will both be discharged at not being able to keep up and needing to heavily modify.  Do the DVD's instruct you how to properly modify or do you have to figure that out on your own?  

I'm trying to set expectations that we won't be able to do everything from the get go and that's the point, by month 3 we will and that will be improvement.

One question I have is about a good tasty recovery drink with no lactose.  Can we use chocolate almond milk with whey protein powder added?  If anyone has suggestions let me know.

I'm already pretty fit. I'm a runner (have been since I was 13, currently 26). Thanks to an active childhood, high metabolism, and lots of distance running, I've always been thin. So, I'm not using the program to try to lose weight. I'm also still running (currently at 40-50 miles per week), because I'm a marathoner and I have fall races coming up. I have and always will be a runner at heart. I love it dearly, and racing is important to me, so if I had to weigh the importance of running vs. P90X, running would win. That said, I'm a grad student with the summer off from classes, so I have my evenings free after work and decided to do P90X with the goals of 1. building more strength in my core/lower body, because strength helps with speed; 2. develop a little more ab definition so I can feel like a rockstar; and 3. hopefully develop my upper body some since being a skinny runner means I have ridiculously scrawny arms. 

So, that in mind, tonight was round 1 of Yoga, and I absolutely hated it. I've tried yoga a handful of times over the years, and hated it every single time. What can I say? I find it to be incredibly boring (worse than the dreadmill), and I get frustrated because it just seems to be this slow paced repetition of similar movements over and over. If it were 30-45 minutes, I think I might have stuck it out, but I quit after 30 minutes when I realized I had an hour left. 

So, keeping in mind my current fitness level and my goals, how important is doing the full 1.5 hours of yoga? If it's just there to add another day of getting your heart rate up for people who use P90X as an all inclusive workout, well I already ran 9.5 miles today so I've got that covered. But, if I'm going to have significantly less results without it, then I'll try to drag myself through it.

It wasn't a personal record, but that course is really challenging (I'm hoping to do an overall PR on a flat course in about a month).

For anyone that's interested, I had to modify the program a little bit. I run early in the morning and do P90X in the evening. Normally yoga is day four and something involving the legs is five, but I had to switch those because I was too sore when I was doing long runs on Saturday mornings. Also because of the long runs, I've not been doing the Kenpo or whatever else is scheduled on day six. 

I'm still working to find what works best for me (as my ultimate goal is to run longer and faster), but regardless this is the best shape I've ever been in.

The first 30 days go by so fast! 

I come from a primal background, which is essentially a low-carb high fat diet, with lifestyle of 1 day of sprints a week, pumping iron twice a week, and low intensity walking or hiking the rest of the week. 

After doing this lifestyle since 2009, P90X hit me like a ton of bricks the first week. The first 30 days with the diet I felt right at home, because it was low carb, albeit with high protein. A few minor modifications and I was good to go. 

At this point I think it's pretty safe to say I am a convert from the primal lifestyle over to more athletic home/gym workouts. I have seen more results in 30 days than I did in years doing more moderate workouts.

I am a few days into the moderate carb phase, and I just started the recovery formula. I didn't really take many supplements, just a whey protein from grass-fed cows, and a supplement called ON CGT-10. I ate 1600-2200 cals per day.

Beginning weight was 175lbs ending 178lbs, went from M shirt to L fitted. Flexibility and coordination is GORGEOUS!

I looked like day 1 for probably the last 3-4 years, so any change was welcome at this point. Any comments or questions are appreciated!

-Anthony

TL;DR - P90X completely transformed my flexibility, coordination, strength in only 30 days. I'll let you decide how much it helped with appearance.

I followed the workout plan fairly well for the full 90 days. I wasnt too strict on the diet plan because I wasnt trying to lose weight. I did cut out all soda and candy though. I gained about ten pounds during my 90 days and I was pretty happy with my results. After the first 30 days, I realized that kenpo wasn't doing me any good. Even when I went all out, I wouldn't break a sweat so I swapped kenpo with an upperbody workout that I put together, I started seeing lots more gains then after adding in another resistance workout.

http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/19jtkb/starting_p90x_on_monday/

I won't spam this place with weekly updates but since I've had a pretty awesome first week, I figured I'd pop on and share how that insane first week went.

So, all in all, I did 6 workouts with a total duration of 8 hours 16mins and burned 7780kcals.  I'm 104kg (230lbs).

Now this is nice to say on paper, but the reality was that Week One kicked my ass pretty bad.

Day one was crazy hard, but thanks to doing some pre-reading/pre-watching the videos I knew it was going to be.  My upper body strength has, well, tanked.  My legs, still good, but I blew out a tendon in my arm a couple years ago and I sort of used it as an excuse to never pick it up again - well, that and getting married/having a kid.

Needless to say, the chin-ups/pushups, even doing assisted pullups (100 kg added to assist), I could barely do 6 and standard pushups killed me at 10.  Like, I was wrecked at 8 but forced myself to do 10.

Needless to say, I felt pretty freaking low.  But, thankfully, Tony's advice actually helped me here ""You're going to get better"" - and that, legitimately, helped me keep on going.  

This is starting from zero.

I dropped to my knees and, with that help, I was able to knock out 10 of pretty much all the pushups except diamonds and declines.  Chin-ups are still crazy hard, but I aimed for 5 and managed to get most of them.

Ab Ripper... yeah.  Crunchy Frogs.  Yeah. (Nope).

Day 2: Plyometrics - Now, the next morning, my arms actually felt pretty good - except for my lats and pecs, which were tight and sore as hell.  I walked off to the gym and, since my legs are in decent shape -- I'd been doing stairclimbing and squats over the last few months just to try and eke some semblance of 'health' out of me -- I actually pushed myself to keep up with Tony on the day.  And I did!  I did everything he asked me to and, though some of it really had my legs burning, I pushed myself.

This was a mistake.  A Big Freaking Mistake.

I got a sense of how big of a mistake it was after the workout, when I tried to walk down the stairs of the gym.  Going up? No problem.  Down.  Yeah.  I was clinging to the railing for dear life.

I had officially ruined my legs.  The next day, I couldn't walk without pain.  Stairs - up or down - were simply not an option.  But I still pushed myself onward to

Day 3: Shoulders and Arms.  This one wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  The main obstacle was my inability to move.  It was quite a scene with me trying to do my warm-up jog and unable to lift my heels much more than an inch off the floor.  Luckily since most of the movements were standing - except those goddamned crouching cohen curls - I didn't suffer too much.  Ab Ripper wasn't too kind to me either - trying pull my legs toward my chest... yeah, pain.  Pain, pain, pain.  I did what I could - which wasn't very much - but I did do the whole video and try each exercise.

After the workout was far worse however, my legs were still like steel rods and taking those stairs one at a time, teetering close to falling forward, that was some scary shit.

Day 4: Yoga X - My legs were STILL 80% sore, so I was sort of looking forward to this one.  Walking was easier, though at random times my leg/knee would spasm just as I put my foot down and almost throw me to the ground. (Not fun).  Yoga was crazy hard - the first few dips (no pushups) ended with me landing on my chest.  My first few downward dogs/stretching of calf muscles ended up causing shooting pains of burningness.  It was not fun.  Luckily I kept at it and things did start to loosen up a tad.  There was absolutely no 'flow' involved here, hell, I was happy just to hold the pose, but I made it through the whole session.  The Balance ones were not fun - the tree pose hurt like crazy... but again, I powered through.

Still almost fell down the stairs after the workout though. *sigh*

Day 5: Legs and Back - My legs actually felt a lot better the morning after yoga (only about 30% pain when walking and I could go downstairs with a bit of a hop).  I thought that this workout would hurt my legs more, but it did the exact opposite.  As sore as my legs were going into this one, it full-on stretched them out and got them working perfectly again.  The Groucho Walk - while making me look dumb at the gym - actually helped a lot, it seemed to shake out the last bit of the cobwebs.  For Ab Ripper, the highlights were that I managed to squeak out 25 Leg extensions and 6 crunchy frogs.  I did okay on heels to the heavens -- I had to hold my legs up for it to work but I got a really nice burn out of it.

Day 6: Kenpo X - With my legs now fully healed, this workout was a shit-ton of fun.  I really enjoyed this one.  My legs felt almost, and I know this sounds weird, but 'brand new' is the way to put it.  I just felt so much energy in them and it was nice to be able to move and kick and punch without feeling pain.  Probably the highest 'high' of the week.  Definitely made me feel awesome and looking forward to week 2.

Day 7: Rest.  No stretching, no nothing.  Just rest, glorious rest.

And today, I feel amazing.  I obviously have a ton of upper body work to do, and today kicked my ass again (Chest and back), but I'm incredibly psyched to keep on going.  I've realized that this is going to be more than a 90 day commitment to get to where I want to be... but I'm actually looking forward to it.

Anyway, if you read this entire wall of text, thanks for giving a damn.  And thanks to this whole subreddit for your insight and positivity as I lurked around and learned what I could.  I'll update again after 30 days.

As an extra bonus: On Sunday I went out and managed to (comfortably!) wear a pair of pants that I hadn't been able to fit into since before my wedding.  I'm wearing them now... Feels good man.

TL;DR: Week one is going to hurt and it's going to suck hardcore. But - to me - the way the program is designed - it's almost as if they know that and have worked to help your recovery.

* Don't skip Yoga days! You will not be able to straighten your legs enough in Heals to the Heavens without the necessary flexibility. 
* Fifer Scissors still suck, but it eventually becomes bearable, and I do feel that the challenge is 60% mental.
* The ability to complete the full reps of the most difficult moves followed a distinct order: bicycles forward then back came first, then Oblique V-Ups and Fifer Scissors, and finally Heals to the Heavens. I didn't feel much of a burn in my upper abs until I was able to do the full set.

By the end of the round, we had 93 people check in with their weight loss and 10 people aiming to gain muscle mass. Together, our weight losers have shaved off a combined 1249 lbs (566 kg), or 13.4 lbs (6.1 kg) per person. Our gainers have put on a combined 64 lbs (29 kg), or an average of 6.4 lbs (2.9 kg) per person. [Check out everyone’s progress for Round 3 here](http://i.imgur.com/C8yvY.png). Weight gainers are on the left, weight losers are on the right.

Now that Round 3 of 90 Days Goal has ended, we’re excited to start Round 4 and we’re hoping others will join us in changing their lives.

This isn’t a set diet or exercise routine. This is a group of people working together to better themselves. Whether you want to change a lot or a little, gain muscle or lose weight, everyone is welcome. More than anything else, this group will provide you with a place to talk to other people about health and fitness in a completely open and friendly environment. No question is too basic here.

Second step, subscribe to r/90daysgoal and start browsing through the posts. Ask any questions you might have or answer any questions that you’re knowledgeable about.

There will be daily goal posts to check in with anything you want to discuss and to answer any questions that come up. We also have weekly check-ins to keep up with how everyone is progressing and to troubleshoot if anyone needs feedback. These daily and weekly check-ins help us to be accountable for our decisions, but they also provide each of us with encouragement and motivation to keep heading in the right direction. The first check-in will be posted Monday, June 20th.

Going to follow the P90x subreddit and I've seen a lot of extremely informative posts - thanks to everyone who has contributed!  I hope to also contribute with my results.

I'm 25 years old, 6'0'', 235 (down from 272, been dieting since March) and I thought I was ready to start to ""get to work.""  My weight loss has almost entirely been as a result of diet and not as result of new or demanding exercises (except the occasional treadmill, which I am glad I started).

I picked up P90x, pull-up bar, bands, etc.  Ready to go.  Today was my first day, and needless to say felt pretty discouraged because I could not complete the workout (Classic, Chest&amp;Back + Ab Ripper X).  My question is, as long as I'm pushing myself as hard as I can (within reason, obviously.  Injury is not worth it), is getting it 70~80% of the way through the workout ok to start?  Or would I get better results by doing the entire video but with less resistance (ie. knees, lesser bands).  I would hope within a few weeks I'd be completing the full videos (probably not with 120+ pull-ups though, hah!).

I'm personally of the opinion that going 80% at high (for me) intensity would be better than 100% at a lower intensity.  But I'm deferring to the better judgement of you experts here ;)

Alternatively, is there any benefit from splitting up the exercise as a beginner?  For example, could I do round 1 in the morning and round 2 at night to start?

Just looking for ways to maximize returns and to stick with it.

Thanks again everyone!

All the before and after pictures I see in this subreddit are of people who already look not terrible making themselves look better. Or even somewhat fat people with muscle making those muscles more apparent than the fat. While some find inspiration in that, I lose it. 
My reason for that being, I see these people that look decent getting slow and steady results...I fear that I'll have to do p90x constantly for the next six years of my life to get down to a presentable level, that's where my motivation starts to deteriorate. 


I'm willing to put myself through hell, but there is a limit when it comes to how much hell I'll go through without seeing decent results. Is P90X right for me? Should I try something else — something more cardio intensive? I hesitate to do so because for one, I'm a smoker and cardio + cigarettes = no bueno. Two, I'm not just kind of a piece of shit, I'm an all around piece of shit, in the sense that as fat as I am..I don't have a redeeming factor in muscle mass at all. Meaning I'm somehow some weird combination of fat and scrawny, which makes P90X appealing, in that it should provide a solid base for muscle while helping to lose weight. 

I understand that everyone is different, I understand that it's impossible to predict how a fitness program will suit an individual. So if there's one question that I want answered, it's the following: 

Is it entirely unreasonable for someone like myself to be at least somewhat comfortable going to a, dare I say, beach (by June)? I have no frame of reference as to what 90 days can do for a person like me, and I realize during times where motivation is scarce, that maybe that sort of change is not even humanly possible.

1. How well do you think this would go with only all of the DVD's and a proper diet?

3. Is there anyone out there who can help me stay motivated and keep me on track?

4. What is the best exercise routine to do while doing this in your opinion?

Its been about 3 days since my last post and I wanted to update everyone. I just finished my 5th day of p90x (legs, back, and ARX) I should be on day 6 but I took yesterday off from working out, but not from my diet. Like I said before I was 260 but I always hovered between 260 and 270 but now I am [under!](http://i.imgur.com/1pKOn.jpg) it might not seem like much but baby steps am I right? I have been doing p90x for alittle under a week so I am excited to see what comes next! Lets get this update started!

**Workouts**

Day 3 I was so sore from day 1 and plyo that it hurt to move mostly but I pushed through shoulders and arms and did my best, but nobody ever told me what was around the corner. YOGA! It was my first time doing yoga and as a fat guy its pretty hard. I am not really that flexible, but like Tony says ""Do your best and forget the rest!"" I know that doing yoga will eventually make me more flexible and I have seen interviews with Tony saying that yoga is a big part so I pushed through that also. The next day all the soreness was gone. I am not sure if that was because of yoga or because of time, but I kind of believe yoga helped. Day 5 I just finished with and like I said its still hard but over time I am sure it will work. It seems to be a good amount of balance workouts but also its killer on the legs. Single leg wall squats and chair salutations are insane!

Can't wait for more workouts!

**Diet**

My diet is pretty much the same as my last post. No junk food, no soda, no fast food. Even when I go out and people order greasy apps I always decline having some. Your body is a temple and I want to start treating it as such. Oh also I drink a lot of water, I think that helps.

P90X Classic

Dumbbells
Bands
Push up bar

Starting Weight: 173 lbs

30 Day Weight: 166 lbs

Loss of: 7 lbs

Starting Waist: 34 in
30 Day Waist: 32 in

Love: Kenpo X
Hate: Yoga X

Diet: 2400 calories / day

Rarely hit my 2400 calorie limit in any given day. Some days (4-5 total) I was 1000 calories short of my goal. Most days, I was about 400-500 calories short; so I’ve been averaging about 2000 per day.

Best Friends: Fage 0% Greek Yogurt, PowerCrunch bars, Atkins Low-Carb Bars, Bacon and Egg Whites, Carrots and Celery

Biggest Foes: Chocolate Chips, Cereal, Peanuts, Holiday sweets

Post Workout Recovery: Water, Publix Organic Whey Protein in Skim Milk, plus some manner of protein bar

Food: I really miss crunching into cereal in the morning. Sometimes I’ll have a cup of multi-grain Cheerios, but then I look at the carbs and lack of protein and kick myself for the little bit of enjoyment. For anyone with a sweet tooth like me, grab 4-5 different flavors of sugar free gum to keep with you. When the sweet craving hits, I’m finding that popping a few pieces of gum to chew for 10-20 minutes helps. I also really like PowerCrunch bars. They taste great, are substantial, and have only 10g carbs with a 14g protein punch. I’ve had 5-6 cheat days, but only 2-3 days where I totally killed my diet. Starting P90X during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays is tough.

For phase two, I’m going to stick to the same 2400 calorie diet I did in phase one.

*Whey protein
*Multivitamin

I think my results are ok but could have been better due to a couple of reasons.  I say this because I really don't see that big of a difference between my last two photos.

The first reason is I think my results stalled towards the end is because my nutrition went a little downhill during the last month.  I started to binge eat because I think I was being a little restrictive with my calories.  I upped my calories from 1900-2100 to 2600-2800 per day and finally switched from Fat Shredder 50/30/20 to Energy Booster 40/40/20.  The reason I did this is because I felt myself crashing in workouts and kind of dreading to start the workouts because of this.  Once I started to up my calories I had less bouts with binge eating and started enjoying working out again.

I think another reason my results stalled is because I started to get burned out with Insanity towards the end of the program.  When I originally started my health/fitness journey I did a round of Insanity.  Being burned out/bored led me to not working out with the highest intensity but for me it's hard to keep my mind tricked/challenged for too long before I get.  Don't get me wrong I was still getting tired and going hard but wasn't pushing myself like when the program was fresh to me.

All in all I am happy with my results and now I weigh 186 lbs.  It has been a long time since I have ever weighed this much probably like 8th grade tbh and I am 27 now.  I went to the doctors for my physical and asked about what I weighed last year in Feb when I got my check up to begin this fitness journey and I was at 240 lbs.  Over 50 lbs lost in a year!  I definitely am proud of myself and happy I actually kept up with the nutrition and dedication of making this a lifestyle change.

Even though Insanity and P90x gave me great results, I am going to try to take on a new challenge.  I am going to switch to a RPT routine and start incorporating LeanGains.  I really hope this will be a new challenge and help me get to my goal of 9-10% BF.  

Good luck to everyone on their fitness journey and if a lazy normal working guy can get through the program so can you! Don't give up and never say the words can't just say I currently struggle with and work to improve!

TLDR
Keep up with Nutrition
Keep up with workouts
Don't say I can't

Should I pick classic, doubles, or lean?

Do the workouts help burning fat everywhere? (specifically neck fat)

I've always been a little embarrassed of my legs because I think they're *too* muscular and not ladylike at all, but there's not much I can do about it.  Oh well.

**In these two weeks, I...**

* have gained 2 lbs (from 115-117)
* improved from 22 push-ups to 25.
* improved from 2 chin-ups to 6 (though I stayed constant at 2 pull-ups)

**Goals for the next two weeks:**

* 30 push-ups
* 8 chin-ups
* 4 pull-ups
* bigger ass

**Lessons learned/advice to others starting out:**

* Eat 1-2 hours before working out on resistance training days.
* When doing pull-ups/chin-ups, do as many full ones as you can unassisted, then use a chair to get yourself up and try to hang for as long as you can, slowly lowering yourself as you get tired
* Get full body massages if possible.  In addition to alleviating soreness, they're supposed to help with muscle development
* Ladies, if you have acrylic nails, make sure to get them short!
* Wear workout gloves when lifting

Help me overcome it.,16,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/oya8n/im_a_2_time_p90x_failure_help_me_overcome_it/,"First time, i did plyometrics in 2nd week ( i didn't have the DVD for it the 1st week so substituted with something else) and legs failed during workout. Woke up next morning and literally could not get out of bed from the pain. the Whole week was a horrible mess because i couldn't even get into or out of a car. Getting off any chair was a 3 minute battle.


Second time I started again with my brother. I did 2 weeks of tabata training to condition myself for p90x. We were both going to do it together and he was a great motivation tool...and demotivation tool.  He was better conditioned than me so i would sometimes have small rivalry thing going where i tried to catch up or surpass his stats over the weeks.  Of course it hurt when he could do exercises i couldn't, but that's besides the point. I wanted to finish what i had started. Made it to day 60 and i was proud of myself.


But unfortunately one workout session resulted in my shoulder getting injured for a whole week.  This scared the heck out of me.  I kept getting flashbacks to when i hurt my legs and got scared to ""bring it"" during the rest of the workouts.  I started only doing half the routines, quitting an exercise as soon as i started to feel the burn too much because i was afraid of injury. My workout log was a horrifying sight. that whole week was nothing but failure after failure. it didnt help the fact my brother had to leave for half a month due to personal issues, so his motivational support was missing.


I want to try a 3rd time. I want to really commit this time. I want to follow the diet plan, but my schedule makes preparing food a hazzle since there's not a lot of variety in the p90x nutrition book. but i'm still scared of injury.  I tend to get bad nausea during the workouts which tends to make the session longer than i'm comfortable with.  I want to concentrate more on the nutrition aspect this time, because even though i'm skinny guy 5'11"" 150 pounds, i want to gain weight/muscle, not lose it. Any tips and help for this p90x failure giving it one more try is greatly appreciated.

EDIT:

Thanks for all the words of encouragement and advice.  I'm definetaly taking everything into account. I will post some pics of my progress during the 2nd attempt. Also i used to buy protein shakes at Walmart and drink it about 30 minutes before the workout or after.

* There's clearly more equipment to buy.  They make a point of saying you *can* do the workouts without them, but...  Mo' money to spend.
* Their definition of ""athlete"" excludes distance athletes like runners, triathloners and so on.  Still, there have been people posting recently about how their running has improved on P90X.  FWIW
* Apparently, there's 5 days a week instead of 6.  
* P90X had, IIRC, two or three [complexes](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=navclient&amp;gfns=1&amp;q=dumbbell+complex).  They're talking about more.

* 18 Years Old

* I am mostly using it as a kickstart guide to healthier living, not as a super rigid program.

* I do not follow the nutrition guide to a T, but I do use it as kind of reference. I have changed my diet up to contain healthier food and made my portions smaller. I drink only water, milk, and 100% juice. I do allow my self to cheat once or twice a week however (but always some sort of healthier alternative; no gutbombs)

* Regrettably, I did slack off a little during the recovery week.

* I always push myself 100% when doing the workouts. 

* Currently on week 6 and intermittently do the doubles routine when I have time.

* I will occasionally skip the Ab Ripper routine, but only when I exhaust myself during the previous workout.

* I drink whey protein pre- and post-workout. During resistance days I add creatine post-workout, directly before drinking the whey. I also eat a banana (or some other type of fruit) and a small glass of cranberry or grape juice post-workout.

I've been trying to do StrongLifts for the past couple of months but don't really see much in the way of strength gains (could be that I'm not eating enough or the fact that I'm an insomniac and can't get decent sleep - I'm working to address that - appt with sleep doctor in a couple weeks).

I was looking at P90X. I'd like to get rid of the last bit of flab around my middle and chest. Yeah, I'd like to look a bit ripped this summer. I'd also like to add about 10-15 lbs of muscle, as I think I'm a bit too skinny (always was skinny growing up). Have read some people say that P90X won't easily let you add muscle, but others say I will if I just adjust my diet upwards from the recommendations and shoot for heavier weights/fewer reps on those exercises that use weights.

I'm not planning on doing this at home - I like my gym. I also do some classes at my gym that I don't want to give up - cardio kick on Tuesday nights and a pilates/yoga combo on Thursdays and (sometimes Saturdays). Both classes really push me, so I'm wondering if I could use those as substitutes for the KenpoX and YogaX portions.

Any recommendations? Should I just stick to a strength program? Maybe just take some of the exercise and diet suggestions from P90X and tweak it to fit me? I understand nutrition pretty well and have been eating healthy for years - no (very few) processed foods, sodas, candy, etc. If I fail anywhere it is getting enough veggies - I do lean meats, lots of eggs, oatmeal, etc, but am making a conscious effort to eat more broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, spinach, etc.

I went to urgent care and they immediately said I needed to go to the ER because depending on how the leg is injured you can lose your leg if things go badly (especially if the leg does not ""relocate"" on its own).  I went to the ER - they took X-Rays, everything was ""fine"" except I have a bone chip fracture and the ligaments are completely destroyed.

In the past 90 days, we’ve lost a combined 197 lbs (89.4 kg), or an average of 14 lbs (6.4 kg) per person. We averaged a 4.6% body fat reduction. We also had 3 people bulking up, and they gained a combined 51 lbs (23.1 kg), or an average of 17 lbs (7.7 kg) per person. Now that our first 90 days is over, we’re excited to start on Round II and we’re hoping others will join us in changing their lives.

This isn’t a set diet or exercise routine. This is a group of people working together to better themselves. Whether you want to change a lot or a little, gain muscle or lose weight, everyone is welcome. More than anything else, this group will provide you with a place to talk to other people about health and fitness in a completely open and friendly environment. No question is too basic here.

There will be daily goal posts to check in with anything you want to discuss and to answer any questions that come up. We’ll have weekly check-ins to keep up with how everyone is progressing and to troubleshoot if anyone needs feedback. These daily and weekly check-ins will help us be accountable for our decisions, but they will also provide each of us with encouragement and motivation to keep heading in the right direction.

One of my personal daily goals for Round II is to provide a structured format for those who are interested. I will post some reading materials each morning and others will hopefully add to the discussion with their expertise. My interest in health and fitness is pretty new, but I plan to summarize what I’ve learned over the past few months and we have some more knowledgeable people in the group who are pretty good about providing helpful feedback.

I have been doing p90x for 7 weeks now. In fact, today I will be completing my 7th week. I started off as a very fat individual  (still fat as all shit) and have seen incredible results (see link below, it's from day 1 to 30 to 45) What I want to ask, is it unrealistic of me to expect that I will be gut free/love handle free and have a six pack after only 1 turn of p90x? Am I realistically going to need more than 1 go at this to even have a flat stomach? My 3 months end June 26th.

I've changed my diet recently, upped my protein, cut carbs in half based on suggestions from here and some friends of mine.

Nutrition
Nature Valley bar + 16 raw almonds + 30 unsalted cashew - Breakfast
Snacks - 1 banana, 1 clementine
Lunch - .5 cup brown rice + 1lb of chicken
Dinner .5 cup brown rice + 1lb of chicken
Vegetables used for chicken, green pepper/red pepper/mushroom/garlic
2.5L of water a day

Weekends is the same except the meals are omlettes and wheat noodle with egg and chicken

Intake is about 1550 calories. I am currently 5'11 204lbs.

I haven't been following the diet completely. As I said in my last topic, I've been getting too much fat and probably not enough carbs. I've started following the advice of the incredibly nice commenters and I'm putting more carbs in my diet.

I've been taking one rest day due to schedule issues. Due to that same reason, I missed Kenpo on the rest week, but made up for it by doing it on the 7th day. Same applies to Plyo yesterday. I couldn't due it because of my schedule, so I'll due it on the rest day this week instead.

My results are, in my opinion, not very good. I have lost 5 pounds and definitely gained some strength and stamina, though, so that's something I'm very proud of.

Beware the infamous bathroom pics! I wasn't very ""serious"" about the pictures to begin with, so not only did I use a cell phone in the bathroom, but I only took front and side pictures. For the sake of comparison, I did the same with day 30, but added flexed pictures with it. My day 60 and 90 pictures will be a little more traditional, I promise.

Additional details, my chest is that big due to Shuerman's disease. Not as serious as most cases and something I've worked on to fix my whole life, but the physical symptoms are still there to an extent. I assure you, unfortunately, that it's bone. :P Not muscle.

As for the equipment I understand you need dumbbells, a resistance band, and a chin-up bar. I have a resistance band and dumbbells, I wouldn't mind getting a chin up but I really have no where to put it, I don't want to put it in my door way of the residence building I live in, I'd feel uncomfortable with that. Does Tony give alternatives to the chin-up bar exercises with the resistance band and how effective are they?

26/M/6ft
Weight unchanged at 92kg/203pounds.
Apps used: 90Droid

A few months ago I decided that if I didn’t get the body that I wanted in my 20’s, it’d never happen. I did play sports on occasion and frequent the gym, but time there was mostly spent dicking around and doing exercises I was familiar and comfortable with – chest and arms, with a little abs every now and then. 

I started initially by adjusting diet (mainly portion size and cutting out junk) and lost 6kg/13pounds over a 5 week period. I then discovered P90x

Motivation was high for the first month and I rarely missed a day. Didn’t read much about the diet but a typical day consisted of scrambled  eggs for breakfast and chicken breast or fish filet for lunch / dinner. Had a protein shake (skim milk + a piece of fruit, usually banana) on the days I worked out. 

At the end of the first month a bunch of things happened, had to travel, lost two toenails due to soccer and got quite busy so had to put the fitness plan on hold for 2-3 weeks. I decided to restart the first month but motivation was a lot lower. I was nowhere near as strict with the diet and it took me about 6 weeks to finish. Lazed out on all of yoga. 

I’ve started month 2 now and my motivation is back. 

Overall, the least difficult exercises for me were generally the ones involving weights / pushups / pullups. I love chest and back. Plyo is more of a challenge but I finish it with an additional 15 minutes of breaks (roughly). Yoga kicks my ass. I’m extremely stiff and have never been able to do more than 20 minutes of it. Ap ripper was a disaster when I started, but I’m now able to do almost all of it, though with a 5 minute break halfway. I’ve only done Kenpo once ever, but I figure if I play sports 1-2 times a week it’s no biggie. 

Despite not having stuck with the diet, I’m very happy with progress so far. My general level of fitness has skyrocketed. I’ve gone from someone who can only just finish a one hour game of soccer to the guy who makes up for his lack of skill by running the most throughout the game (yay for plyo). I’ve lost quite a bit of fat around the midsection and I look better than I ever have. 

Some observations and advice for others:
-	I’ve found that it’s better to do your p90 in the gym once you have the routine down. There’s the motivational kick of having other people (especially women) around, plus you’re able to choose from a range of weights. It’s much easier to find the ideal weight for an exercise by picking one rather than adding / removing to the adjustable one at home. 

-	You can use P90X as an excuse to learn cooking. Who knew that oven baked chicken breast was so easy to make?

-	A 1 hour exercise rarely takes just 1 hour, especially at the beginning. Plyo took me around 90 minutes the first time around. Abs, 30. Just something to factor in if you’re looking to start.

-	Protein bars taste foul

-	Some P90X cast members are extremely annoying, but whatever

-	It’s a great motivational kick to see / feel definition where there was none before. Was taking a shower a while back and whoa! Abs!


Given all the above, would appreciate any advice.

He asked if I was in the zone and I responded with ""Fuck Tony probably, I mean you did just kick my ass with all the stuff.""

Now to the nitty-gritty...Why isn't YogaX a good yoga program? Well, to start with, let's explore what fitness enthusiasts gain from yoga. There are benefits to flexibility, strength, and balance. Those are wonderful for anyone who is developing their body, however the biggest advantage of yoga is establishing a stronger mind-body connection. Awareness of where your hips are, how your joints are bent, whether you are lined up, where the edges of your mobility lie, etc. All of these things make a huge difference when it comes to any physical activity, leading to less injuries, faster progress, and better coordination.

In an effort to bust through a ton of vinyasas, YogaX rushes through the warrior poses, barely giving the audience a chance to sink into it, feel the proper form. Positions are timed poorly, moving at different speeds on different sides. There is not a good progression to things like upward dog (which is a pretty extreme spine stretch, usually warmed up to by moving through low cobra and cobra). Really, vinyasa is something that requires a good teacher to really get the most out of. When you're in a lunging twist, you can't see your own hips...It's hard to keep track of all the things your body should be doing in a yoga pose, and you can actually create more problems than you solve if you're doing the poses incorrectly.

The balance section is actually pretty good, as are the stretches...The yoga belly stuff is really unnecessary. Yoga should engage the core as part of the poses, rather than wedging in another set of crunches, which Tony himself says you shouldn't be doing back to back. 

If you're familiar with yoga, you can probably make the best of the DVD by modifying, paying attention to your form and breathing, and skipping out on the yoga belly ripper x. If you're not familiar with yoga, I'd actually suggest dropping $10/wk to go to an actual yoga studio in your area and getting coached on your form. Or do cardio X, or X stretch, or something else that works both flexibility and cardio, but doesn't put you in positions your body isn't used to or ready for.",,False,,t5_2rmaw,False,,,True,t3_xsfqv,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/xsfqv/an_opinion_about_yogax/,

My thoughts and experiences thus far (with an apology to one of the Kids),16,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/tpk27/week_2_is_in_the_books_my_thoughts_and/,"I have never felt this good in my entire life. Ever. When I started p90x 2 weeks ago, I was coming out of what might have been one of the worst weeks of my life (something terrible happened every day and it kept piling on and on and on). After school let out, no one but a few friends and my roommate were left in town. I deactivated Facebook for the summer and started p90x the next day, primarily to take care of myself for once, secondarily to vent.

It has worked.

I feel absolutely fantastic these days. Two weeks later, I have noticed some dramatic differences already, specifically in my calves and shoulders (and general feeling). I have found myself more motivated to get things done, and l have found myself giving more encouragement to others and being a lot kinder for the most part (I will get back to that momentarily).

Between this week and last, I have in many cases started doing double the reps that I was able to do before in some exercises, I started using quite a bit more weight, and I am able to finish exercises that I wasn't able to finish before. I have never been this proud of myself. I have a long way to go, but I know I will make it. If I can make it, anyone else can. Just keep pressing play.

In regards to being kinder, I have typically been not so kind in my recent years. It isn't on purpose, but that is just how it has been. I owe an apology to Dom from plyo. Earlier this week, I referred to him as ""that douche in the back,"" and he did nothing to deserve that other than bringing his all, like anyone should. I apologize to Dom and anyone that I've ever insulted for giving it their all. I am trying to join you now.

P90X is more than a physical change.

Here's how it's gone for me so far:

* Day 1 - I managed to get a very good workout, despite the fact that I broke a band during my first set of heavy pants!  (I think this band was poorly constructed, and I will return it for a replacement when I get back home!)  I was in the Marines for 9 years, and I don't remember my chest or core hurting like this since bootcamp!  Great workout.  

About 20 minutes in, there was a knock at the door and I thought maybe I was bothering neighbors with the sounds of me Bringing It, but it was the hotel staff offering turn down service.  I cheated on the diet and accepted the pillow candies before she left.

* Day 2 - Plyo was amazing.  No bands needed, but holy cow all the jumping and hip flexor stuff after Ab Ripper X the previous day was HARD!  (And effective!)  Again, 20 minutes in, and the lady with the candy showed up.  This is becoming part of my routine.

* Day 3 - Arms and Shoulders with bands was kind of disappointing. I spent way too much time between sets adjusting bands, changing tension, perfecting the loop under my foot, etc.  Plus the tension at the beginning of a movement isn't quite enough, while the tension at the end of a movement is sometimes too much.  Such is the use of bands, I suppose.  I will plan to learn these moves and use dumbells in hotel gyms whenever I can for arms.  

Yes, there was candy on day 3 too.  

* Day 4 - This should be yoga, but I'm seriously considering skipping it today.  Here's how I'm justifying that.  (1) I'm in a foreign country and I'd really like to just go for a long walk after work today and explore, and time is kinda tight.  (2) I'm really really sore and could use the rest.

1333602558.0,12,self.P90X,ru81g,Borderline morbidly obese teenager starting P90X again.  Looking for some motivation and perhaps a few tips.,13,1,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/ru81g/borderline_morbidly_obese_teenager_starting_p90x/,"Hey there fellow P90X-er's! Long time lurker of this here subreddit but I have finally decided that I need to make a post since I'm finding myself in a bit of a rut right now..

So a little bit about myself.
I am a 17 year old male living in NY.  I am currently 6'2"" tall (about 188cm) and I weigh anywhere between 300 and 310 pounds based on the day (136-140kg) and my BMI is about 39.8.. only .2 away from being morbidly obese.  I've been overweight for as long as I can remember but I have only recently started realize that I have a serious problem on my hands.  I play football for my high school and in an effort to be even more physically active I did winter track and now I am doing spring track.  Although I am overweight, I try my best to remain physically active.  I work out about 3 times a week, play basketball on the weekends and go swimming twice a week but somehow I have never managed to start a weightloss regime that I could stick with.

A few months ago I was at a friend's house for a weekend and he was in phase 3 of his second run through the P90X program and it was then that I decided to try it.  I ordered it in February and started it immediately and fell in love with the first couple of days (I actually enjoyed suffering through plyo!) but I couldn't seem to push myself to continue past day 10.  Since then I have tried to restart the program 3 times and have failed every single time.  My most recent attempt was thwarted by a severe high ankle sprain that had me laying in bed for the better part of two weeks.  

Finally, this monday April 2nd (on an almost fully healed ankle) I decided to start the program again and this time I'm hellbent on getting through the whole thing.  I have a pretty rough schedule and the diet isn't something that I can see myself following honestly.  This is where I turn to the fine people of this subreddit for help.  

I am a junior in an ivy league prep school so my workload is pretty heavy and I feel like it will be preventing me from sticking to my plan so I thought I'd lay it out to give everyone an idea of what I'm dealing with.

* 6:30am - Wake up for school, leave the house by 7am
* 8:35am to 3:10pm - I have class
* 3:30pm to 5:45pm - I have track practice
* 7:00pm to 7:30pm - I get home
* 8:00pm - The time that I always start my P90X workout
* 10:00pm - By this time I've worked out, showered and eaten dinner and I'm ready to start my homework
* 1:00am - The time that I usually go to bed

As you can see, I get about 6 hours of sleep on a pretty good day so my first question would be is this enough?  I know that I need somewhere closer to 8 hours a night but I have no room for it in my daily routine.  I haven't found lack of sleep to be something that holds me back when it comes to working out because I always seem to find the energy that I need in order to get through it.  

In terms of my diet... I am the youngest in the house and when it comes to meals my mom is the one that makes them most of the time so what we eat is pretty much up to her.  While she does in fact cook healthy food, it's not exactly the diet laid out in the booklet for us.  According to the book I should be having upwards of 3000 calories a day and I find myself getting there with relative ease.  Even though I can't follow the exact diet, I still try and get the basic concepts of it so I'll get those X servings of Y everyday.  Soda, snacks and fast food have been eliminated almost completely from my diet.  
My question here is about the calories.  Should I be eating fewer than the recommended amount? I understand that I need those calories in order to have the energy needed to do the workout but would it be safe to assume that if I can cut lets say 500 calories from that everyday that it will help me lose more weight?  Do any of you have any tips on how to play with the calorie count in order to get slightly results?

Some other things to add..
While I am significantly overweight and I do in fact have a lot of fat to lose, I am not a weak person for the most part.  My lowerbody is the stronger part (I can legpress 800lbs for about 8 reps and do about 10 reps of 375lbs in calf raises) for sure but I still have issues with it.  My body shape is very much like an inverse hourglass with the majority of my fat concentrated around my butt, thighs and stomach.  What days should I try to go extra hard on in order to target these areas more?
I also take a pre-workout supplement (N.O. - Xplode) and it seems to work wonders for me.  I used it before P90X for days when I wanted to do some heavy lifting and I feel like I'll benefit from it for this workout as well.  I'm open to any suggestions for other supplements that I could take to help me some more.

**TL;DR VERSION**
I'm realizing now that this post is getting pretty long so I'm going to try and shorten it up.  I am determined to go through P90X all the way this time but I need help.  My main issue is my midsection so I'd like to know what days I should try harder on in order to get the most out of the workout.  How can I mess around with my calorie intake to maximize my weightloss?  What kind of supplements can I take?  Will track practice (note: I am a thrower for track so our practice mostly consists of practicing our throws and about twice a week we workout so what should I do in the gym on those days to not interefere with the muscle confusion of P90X?) get in the way of my workout? 

Any and all help and motivation will be greatly appreciated.. I don't have any pictures right now (I keep forgetting to take my pre pictures &gt;.&lt;) but I plan on posting a thread probably this weekend with some in order to give you guys a better idea of what I'm dealing with.

Since I'm feeling a little lethargic tonight, I thought I'd look to Reddit for some momentum. I know there are a whole bunch of us that started around the New Year who SHOULD be well into Phase 2 of the program. A lot of you have gone silent. :)

Let's hear some updates. Give it to me! What are your greatest achievements so far? What are you currently struggling with?

Myself, I HATE Chest Shoulders and Triceps. Such a brutally tough workout to complete correctly. I can't fathom doing a one-arm pushup. Anyways, that's what I have on for tonight. My goal, as usual, is simply to survive. The only thing I can imagine being any worse would be doing Back and Biceps off of mute (that one girl is cringe-worthy).

On the plus side, really happy with my improvements on core and Ab ripper. Body fat is down from 18 to 12.5% which makes me feel absolutely GREAT. Hoping to get it under 10 by the end of 90 days. 

The other thing I found out recently was that Interval X Plus is an awesome replacement for Kenpo X. So if you're anything like me and hate going through the motions in a ""non-X""-level workout, give Interval X+ a try. It's short and it will make you sweat buckets!

Well, after writing all that, I feel just a bit more pumped. Let's hear how you're doing. Cheers everyone.

I can certainly see a difference in the mirror that looks quite a bit more substantial than the 7 lbs I lost, which I think is due to a gain of muscle mass.  I wear a Polar heart rate monitor every workout (haven't missed a single workout) and according to it, I'm averaging burning about 900 calories per workout.  (700 or so with Yoga. Kempo, Plyo and even things like legs and back are typically over 1000 for me.)  My heart rate is typically in the 160s-170s.

This is one of those posts where I think I know the answer, but I just have to hear it.  Am I bringing it?  I didn't discover negative pull ups until last week, so I still can't do a single pull up, but I've seen marked improvement in just 1 week of doing negatives.  (I think the chair was too much help.)  Yoga I feel like I'm a complete disaster at, but I keep pushing through it, even if I sit about a quarter of it out.

I guess just based on the numbers I feel like I'm where I should be, but compared to the super-humans on screen, I always wonder if I should be pushing harder.  It's tough for me because the only time I have to do it is at night after my kids go to bed, and my energy level is a bit lower then.

But, I'm serious now. 

The past 2 weeks have been great for me and we've been walking nearly 3 miles every day for the last week, but now we're starting p90x we did the first workout last night (We don't have a pull-up bar, so when they did pull ups we just jogged/high kneed in place) But I'm looking into getting her a resistance band as I don't have any weights for her light enough. Right now she's using just a soup can, to get form correct. 

Anyways, the work out was insane and we hardly kept up at all to their 30 pushups. I came close a few times, but I'm still 280lbs and it's a lot of weight to put upon my arms like that.

Nonetheless, at the end of p90x am I looking to drop a significant amount of weight on top of my calorie counting? I think this is a no brainer, but I saw some p90x graduates that barely lost 3lbs, is that because they bulked up and didn't follow a 'diet' or calorie restrictive lifestyle?

Fill me in graduates, is this a program we should continue? (regardless of answer we are going to, to see the outcome and then we are hopefully moving on to INSanity work outs)

What other things do I need to do p90x other than weights, or a resistance band/pull up bar?

I haven't done any other workouts so I don't know what's in store but I hear it's very vigorous and I'll enjoy it. If I sleep like I did last night for the entirety of this, I'll probably do p90x daily!

I've been going to the gym now for nearly a year and I noticed initial results (small initial results - fat loss) but now I don't seem to be getting anywhere, there trainers at the gym seem like they don't really know anything and it drains my enthusiasm for going. I'm moving house in a few weeks (my first house) and I could really use the money to go towards something else (£52 per month).

It's just, I was watching that typical (sorry) American style of advert where they go on and on and on selling this product to you for like 30 minutes and then 99% of the time you get the product and it's not that great.

Basically what I'm hoping for is for people who have been on the program to testify. P90X is £100 here in the UK which isn't much when you consider it's 2 months gym membership for me so by the end of the 3 months i'll be in ""profit"" but I'm scared of putting so much time into something else after the failure of the gym and then not seeing results.

a) me having to focus on my master thesis before turning it in  

b) an injury picked up during soccer.

I figured that I just continue with the program, as I continue to eat well. My muscles were definitely improving during the first three weeks, so that was quite a bummer to halt that progress.

DAE have similar experiences with yoga-x?  Any tips for how to get more out of it?  I felt like Tony went too fast, like pausing it constantly turned the workout into a game of Twister, and like I never really understood what the hell we were doing (or why).  Maybe a good website or something where I could read more about why yoga is worth doing so that I could at least get my head around this.  I feel like the next time yoga-x comes up in the rotation, I'm going to just go for a run and call it a day.

tl;dr yoga-x was awful: boring, repetitive, impossible to keep up with.  Any tips for how to get more out of it?

**EDIT: Thanks for all the comments.  I agree completely that I should give it another shot; I plan to continue doing it.  It's good to know that I'm not alone in feeling like it was too long and more than a little boring.

I didn't falter at all through the entire 90 minutes, a little wavering but never faltered. My core is so much stronger wrapping up a third pass through P90X that not even the roughest balance postures sent me into a prat fall. 

People may question the value of Yoga X but I have never once regretted doing the routine.

I'm a guy, 41 years old, 5'9"", 205 pounds.  Used to be a fitness trainer in college, so I know this stuff; no excuses.

What I've done right: 
+Morning workouts = higher metabolism, sets day on the right path.
+Good setup of workout gear: dumbbells, chin up bar, etc.
+Tracking workouts.
+Sticking with it.  Haven't given up.
+I really enjoy the workouts, and seeing the positive changes in my body.
+Cut WAY back on alcohol.  I had gotten into the habit of having 1-2 beers or glasses of wine a night before p90x.  Gave that up 2 weeks in, without regrets.

What I've done wrong (aka, struggled with):
-Haven't been consistent with the nutrition.  Haven't been following the food program, rather, eating healthier, but not sticking to nutrition program.
-Average 3-4 workouts a week, instead of the 6 in the program.
-Tend to dump the cardio days; 
-Haven't done evening workouts if I miss my morning one.
-Haven't given up diet cokes yet; I honestly think this has a bigger impact than I have thought in the past.  It's a big sabotage.
-Still eating late at night, albeit healthier foods than I have been in the past.

We just wrapped up Round 10, and we’re getting ready to start Round 11 this Monday.

**What 90days is and what it isn’t**

This isn’t a set diet or exercise routine. It isn’t a competition with prizes (check out /r/BTFC for that). 90days is a group of people working together to better themselves. Whether you want to change a lot or a little, gain muscle or lose weight, everyone is welcome. More than anything else, it's a place to talk to other people about health and fitness in a completely open and friendly environment. No question is too basic here.

**What’s the format?**

Every morning there's a Daily Goal thread where you can post your goals, ask questions, or read through other people’s updates. There's a weekly check-in thread every Monday and several themed posts (Runners, Fitocracy challenges, Students, Women Losing Weight) throughout the week to keep us all on track.

If you'd like to join us for the next round, stop by and tell us about yourself and your goals in the [official introduction thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1i0967/mod_official_introduction_thread_for_round_11/). Round 11 will officially begin on Monday, July 15th. On Day 1 there will be a signup form to fill out so that we can keep track of group statistics. Group and individual progress will be posted at the end of each month using a display name based on age, gender, and height.

**What are these sprints I keep hearing about?**

You'll see the word ""sprints"" thrown around quite a lot.  Don't worry, we're not going to force anyone to go sprinting.  Sprints are what we do to make it easier to stick to the whole 90 days.  We've split the 90 days into 3 sprints, each one 30 days long with a 5 day rest period in between.  Why did we do this?  Well, we found out that more people stuck around if they could focus on their goals for shorter periods of time and then have a short rest before resuming.  When you set your goals, you can not only set goals for the entire 90 days, but also for each sprint.

**What's the schedule?**

Sprint 1: July 15 - August 13

Recovery: August 14 - August 18

Sprint 2: August 19 - September 17

Recovery: September 18 - September 22

Sprint 3: September 23 - October 22

**TLDR;** If you’re interested, subscribe to /r/90daysgoal. Day 1 is July 15th. There will be informational posts throughout the first couple weeks to get everyone started toward their goals. We'll have a progress/recovery week at the end of each month. The final day will be October 22nd. I hope we’ll all have something to celebrate in three months!",,False,,t5_2rmaw,False,,,True,t3_1i6e47,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/1i6e47/round_11_is_starting_over_at_r90daysgoal/,

It's time to give P90X another try.  About a year ago, I started X after having the DVDs sit on my shelf for a couple years.  It was great.  I felt great.  I followed the portion plan and used myfitnesspal to track all of my food.  The changes in my body were noticeable almost immediately (I'm a small guy ~150 lbs. 5'9"").  I made it a month and a half into the program, then a disaster hit.  A fucking life changer.  

My mom died.

At that point, I had lost all motivation.  It didn't help that I had my sister staying with me for a couple weeks at that point to help me take care of everything.  I don't even think she knows what a vegetable is anymore. All my offers of cooking healthy meals were rebuffed.  We ate out at every meal. 

Well, fast forward to today.  I was sitting at work this past Monday (April 1) and kind of out of the blue, I said fuck it.  Time to do this again.  So I started that same day.  Since I haven't lifted anything heavier than a 32 oz. of High Life in the past year, I'm calling this week ""Warm up week"".  Knowing the kind of pain (that oh-so-good pain) I'd be in by Wednesday, I started easy to hopefully mitigate some of that.  I did half of the chest and back (no abs) disc on Monday.  Half of Plyo on Tuesday.  Wednesday I did all of arms &amp; shoulders, and ab ripper.  Yesterday I did all of Tony's One on One Yoga.  I will be doing all of legs &amp; back and ARX today.  Let me say, I already feel good.  Fucking great!  I missed this.

This coming Monday (April 8), is what I'm considering my real start date and that's when I'll start counting down my 90 days.  I will continue to do things like I did last time, as I was very happy with the results I was seeing.

Food will be portion plan and tracked with myfitnesspal.
Supplements will be: [ACG3](http://store.ndsnutrition.com/pmd-sports-nutrition/pmd-acg3/) pre workout, [Dark Matter](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/mhp/darkmatter.html) post workout, Body Fortress Protein Powder, Clif Builder Bars, Creatine Monohydrate, Vitamins, and Omega 3's and 6's from fish oil pills and/or ground flax seed. I've got my kitchen scale out and stocked up the kitchen on Tuesday.  I'm ready. Let's do this.

**tl;dr** About a year ago, I did P90X for a month and a half. Mom died, lost all motivation. Started easy again on Monday, will go full bore and start counting my 90 come next Monday (April 8).

1360598293.0,11,self.P90X,18bacl,I'm a skinny guy with a fat belly. Have some questions about the P90X workout and diet.,12,1,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/18bacl/im_a_skinny_guy_with_a_fat_belly_have_some/,"Hey. First I want to say what a wonderful community this is! The motivation this subreddit gives is amazing!

Today I finnished my first P90X week(resting day today). As everyone else, my body is totally destroyed, but what a good feeling! My mental state hasn't been better in years! (Also my first week without alcohol in 5 years!)

My question is about the workout and diet. I'm 6inches tall and 165lbs. I'm pretty skinny, but have alot of fat around my belly. 
Should I follow the P90X program(phase 1) to get ""ripped"" first and then go for 8reps to gain as much muscles as possible?(phase 2 + 3).

Diet: should I eat more carbs than the diet says because I'm skinny?
My diet this week has been like this:


Breakfast: omelet (6eggs + mushrooms), 1box of tuna and a glass of milk

Snacks: 1box of tuna

Lunch: salat + bread with fish

Snacks: nuts + apple

Dinner: 10oz cod + white rice + salad

Pre workout: 2 bananas

Workout

After workout: 1box of tuna + apple

Snacks: 2slices of bread with peanutbutter

I will get my whey protein powder in about 2 weeks.

Do you see any faults about my diet?

My english isn't very good, so I can rewrite the text if it's not understandable or my questions seem unclearly.

I am supposed to begin the second phase of P90 in few days. I think about switching to P90X instead of doing the second phase of P90 since the results might be better after 90 days for P90x.

What do you think about that? Is it a good idea? In total it will be like 45 days of P90 and then 90 days of P90x.

Thank you for your help and sorry for my bad english.",,False,,t5_2rmaw,False,,,True,t3_16wgzs,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/16wgzs/switching_from_p90_to_p90x/,

I feel like a slob for letting that happen so I want to get back on the horse.

I started p90x over and this time I am doing everything right. If you have read my last post I am still 260 but I am a little bit taller (5'10""). Also I have added another job to my bartending and school. I also bartend at a higher class restaurant so that kind of gives me access to healthier foods.


**Food**
I have been using [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) Which comes in handy because you can just scan barcodes and it has an entire database of foods to pick from. Also I havent been drinking soda, which was one of my vices. Usually I start my morning out with 4 -5 eggs and and wheat toast. For a little snack later on I have a protien shake ( I use 2 scoops of body fortress Whey protein mixed with non fat milk or water). Lunch I usually have a salad with grilled chicken and no dressing. More little snacks like bananas, apples, and oranges. For dinner I will have something like Salmon with steamed broccoli , or Grilled chicken with mixed veg.

**Workouts**

So I started p90x again yesterday after having it forever. This time I feel like I am doing it right and will keep doing it no matter what. Day 1 wasnt too much of a problem. I can do a couple of the moves no problem but pull ups are non existent in my world right now, so I take a not from Tony and modify! A chair helps but I know dont rely on it. You still have to do the work to get the results.

Day 2 is the day I always fear. Plyometircs....... Last time seemed easier compared to this time but Do your best and forget the rest. I stumbled through some of the moves but I kept going, and so did the sweat. Again Tony kicked my butt and strangely it feels great. 

I am looking forward to tomorrows workout and I think its going to be a great start to a great year. I wont fall off this time!

TLDR: I am back in action and doing things right.",,False,,t5_2rmaw,False,,,True,t3_15pt7j,http://www.reddit.com/r/P90X/comments/15pt7j/i_am_back_to_atone/,
