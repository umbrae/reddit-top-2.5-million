1310955728.0,87,self.BipolarReddit,isg2c,I was recently hospitalized in a mental hospital after putting a gun to my head and backing out the last second. A few things I learned while I was in there..,103,16,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/isg2c/i_was_recently_hospitalized_in_a_mental_hospital/,"I have Bipolar II, and lately my depression has taken over completely. Even my manic states were depressive. I've alienated, pushed away, and was overbearing to everyone I knew, and as a result I have really no one left.

After two years of nothing but absolute hell, the girl that I thought was going to be my savior turned out to be the most heartless, cruelest person I ever met when she told me that she was fucking at least 3 other guys. She had me convinced that my bipolar disorder was causing me to be paranoid over her 'hanging out with her guy friends'. I felt used, cheated, lied to, and betrayed. It was the last straw.

That night I was sitting in my car when I put my 9mm pistol to my head. I was going through my life, all the good times, and the bad. I was trying to remember everyone and everything one last time. I put the gun to my head and right before I pulled the trigger I envisioned my mother's reaction to my suicide. I couldn't do that to her, or my father.

I immediately drove to the nearest mental hospital with nothing more than the clothes on my back. I told them that I was certain I wouldn't live through the night if they didn't help me. I was 'incarcerated' there for 6 days.

While the time spent between group therapy meetings and speaking with the psychiatrist was the most extreme and excruciating boredom I'd ever experienced, those meetings and talks helped a lot.

Basically my life was like a game of Jenga. My life was like a new tower- organized, sturdy, and complete. But one by one, pieces of my life were taken away, lost, or pushed away. Eventually it came down to that one critical piece supporting everything else, and when it was removed, everything came crashing down.

I learned that my mistake was basing my happiness and emotional well-being on whether others accepted or supported me. I tried to force others to like and accept me, and when it didn't happen I couldn't handle the pain of that loss. 

I know now that I must first **become the person that I want to be.** This isn't an issue of not ""accepting myself"", because the person I was nearly killed me. I had to make a change if I was going to survive and keep the relationships that I create. I'm setting realistic goals for my recovery, and giving everything I got to achieving them. I'm getting the right help for my disease and continuing my treatment even when I get the results I am hoping for.

I am going to finally lose the weight that has made me so insecure.

I am going to eat healthy.

I am going to go to therapy.

I am going to take my medication.

I am going to learn how to cope with being disappointed, hurt, and abandoned. These things WILL happen again. That's life. I just can't let it break me down.

I am going find a way to let go of the past, and making myself wiser and smarter in the process.

**I am, for the first time in years (if ever), going to be truly happy.**

Going back to the Jenga analogy, I am now rebuilding that tower. Only this time I'm building it stronger and smarter, so no one person or event can ever bring it all down again.

It goes into the neuroscience behind bipolar and creativity as separate things, the effects of medication on a person's creative drive, and the experiences of bipolar people expressing their creativity after going on medication. Actually, here, have the abstract:


""There is a definite link in the direction of bipolar tendencies fostering creativity, although the mechanisms of this link remain unclear. Neurology does not provide us with any clear anatomical connection between the biological bases of bipolar disorder and creativity, though neurotransmitters may be implicated. Treatment for bipolar disorder includes medication and therapy; certain types of therapy are more conducive towards creativity, while certain types of medication can encourage or inhibit it. A therapist absolutely must consider the effect on creativity of the treatment plan they set out for a creatively inclined bipolar patient, or else they run the risk of noncompliance from the patient and uselessness for the plan. Bipolar disorder cannot be treated as if it is separate from the individual experiencing it; at its core, it is a human disorder, and to ignore the human experience is to fundamentally misunderstand the disorder itself.""



Would anyone be interested in reading it? It's about 25 pages. I tried to write it to be accessible to people who aren't into psychology, which worked everywhere except the neuroscience part, but considering how many bipolar people express themselves creatively, it might be cool for you to find out what in the brain makes it happen?

In some ways it is a relief. I finally know what I have and that there is hope. In other ways, the diagnosis has brought nothing but harm.** 

How? I was naive and I told everybody about my diagnosis. I never had to deal with the stigma of being Bipolar. I have never had to deal with the ignorance and it burns like magma in my gut. 

For example, my sister has several bipolar friends and the other day, when I was applying for disability, she was tells me that her friends are just lazy to work because they are on disability. That her one friend should just get over being depressed and get out of her room.

**It's like the idea that bipolar disorder is a serious disability is completely off her radar and that we're just lazy.** 

Or another family member telling me that ""Everybody has ups and downs."" Or ""You'll get over it."" I mean, really? I've been told that there was something wrong with me since I was 8 years old. I've either  been depressed or delusional for most of my life. I have a record of hospitalizations from the time I was 17. I'm 30.

**But now that I have finally been diagnosed I should just use the power of positive thinking to miraculously cure my brain.** 

The ignorance, it burns. I have yet to run into anybody who isn't bipolar who understands that bipolar disorder can lead to extremely serious cognitive impairments over time. 

I have also yet to run into anybody who isn't bipolar who understands that episodes can lead to psychosis and delusions that are very similar to schizophrenia. 

**In fact, when I recently went in for help I was thought I was developing schizophrenia and I was terrified.** 

It upsets me that bipolar disorder is looked at as almost a joke and yet so few people even know what it is.

They think that manic episodes are the only defining feature. The fact is many of us have relatively light manic episodes. We may only have one or two major manic episodes in our past. The rest of the time many of us are suffering from serious chronic depression. 

I don't have to preach to the choir here. But you know what I mean. It's like bipolar is a punchline instead of an illness.

**The general public assumes we're just lazy. Or psychotic psycho killers who should be locked up with criminals.** 

Or just making excuses. You know, that's another one. If a person has Multiple Sclerosis that disables them we don't expect them to hold a full time job and call them lazy if they can't. 

**In general we don't tell people with MS that their debilitating illness is just an excuse and that they should work harder.**

You get breast cancer or prostate cancer and family and friends actually cares enough to ask you about it. 

To offer to help you out when you need it. 

Breast Cancer: 98% cure rate if diagnosed early.
Prostate Cancer: 95%  cure rate if diagnosed early.

Bipolar Disorder: NO CURE

15-25% increased risk of suicide.
Average -9 years of life. 

But that's okay because if you have a mental illness.

You're just lazy.

But they didn't seem to care about my bipolar or the fact I would struggle. It was sort of a dog eat dog world mentality.  After two months, I crashed, and I burned severely.

I was never going to go through that again.

Last week, I had a nice bout of mania and I applied to different colleges online for more information.

This one college has been calling constantly for the past three days.  These past three days, I've been deeply depressed about not getting my disability. I've hated my life, and myself.

So today, whilst crying, because I had a mini-breakdown as soon as I woke up, the phone rang.  It was the college again. The same woman named Courtney who has been persistent in getting in contact with me.

This was how our conversation started.

""Hello, Tonya. My name is Courtney and I see that you were interested in knowing more about Ashford University. Are you still interested?""

*""Honestly? I was having some great mania and thought I could conquer the world.  But not so much today.  I'm bipolar, and I suck at life.""*

**""Let me stop you right there.  My sister has bipolar.  I know what it's like for a person to suffer from it.  But let me tell you, you can do whatever you want in life, and you deserve the best.  I'll be here every step of the way. Let me help you make your life better.""**

And thus, within two hours, I'd applied properly, and re-applied for FAFSA (fingers crossed that it goes through).

For the past month or so since I finally broke up with my other bipolar ex-boyfriend, frankly I've been feeling a lot better without that baggage. Like I've been feeling good. Been trying to exercise, sleep more, eat right, eating my meds. And most importantly, I think I've found a passion in life that I actually really like enough to pursue as a job. I don't know if it's the right step for my career yet, but it's a huge challenge that I feel like taking on. 

For the longest time I figured I'd never really get past 21 (and I still think I'm going to die young), but for the first time in my life I feel like I actually have something to really live for. Don't get me wrong, I still have bad days. My anger and hate is awful, my temper is worse. The down cycles are bad. I still have not forgiven myself for many things. I don't know how to live with that. But I know that I will figure it out someday, and that it's okay to figure it out someday, slowly.

I know it's extremely cheesy to say all of this and it may be hard to believe if shit is really getting you down. I just want to say I hope all of you know that you are loved by someone out there (me), and that I know how bad it is. I hope you feel better soon.

My pdoc told me to stop taking them immediately, which was last Monday. Since then I've been a spiraling mess of emotions, tearful and reverting back to my old crazy ways.

Although it's addressed to me personally, I decided to post it here in the hopes that it helps someone else out. Hopefully you can identify with some parts of it.*


&gt; You are not normal. You’re not inferior to other people, you’re not weak, but you’re not normal. “Normal” people don’t deal with the same setbacks you’re dealing with, and the only people who will empathize are those who have been there. It’s like someone handed you a spoon, when everyone else has a shovel, and you’re expected to dig the same size hole. It doesn’t mean you’re worth less than them if you can’t do it. You might feel that way sometimes, because “normal” people expect you to be handling your problems the same way they do. They might think you’re making excuses, or just not trying hard enough. It hurts to have people frustrated at you because you just can’t do something they can. You’ll get frustrated at yourself. It’ll feel like you’re not good enough. If you were, you could deal the same way everyone else does, right? But you need to know that **it’s not your fault.** There is nothing inherently lesser about **you,** it’s just that the tools you were given mean you have to work harder than other people. You’ll notice that “normal” people also lack that little voice in their head that constantly tells them they’re not good enough.

&gt; Also, you don’t have to try so hard to seem normal. You don’t need to feel guilty whenever you slip up, whenever you forget something, when you screw up. Lying might seem like the solution, but trust me when I say it’s not. You’re lying to yourself when you think, “I could do that if I tried, so why bother trying?” You’re lying to other people by pretending to be okay when you’re really overwhelmed. It sounds like a cliché, but there’s **no shame** in needing help. You don’t have to do everything by yourself to make up for being “born inferior” (you are not inferior). Nobody expects you to be perfect. Stop punishing yourself. You shouldn’t aspire to be better than everyone else, and you’re not worse than everyone else right now. You are you, and that’s okay. You can never get rid of that crippling self-doubt (or maybe you can, but I’m not sure yet), but you **should** know that nobody else is looking down on you as much as you are.

&gt; Your high points don’t negate the low ones. Going from a crying mess of a person to a happy teenager who just needs to wear long sleeves to cover it up **doesn’t mean it’s fine.** Just because you’re not feeling low doesn’t mean you never did, and feeling better isn’t the same as fixing it. You also shouldn’t doubt the validity of your feelings just because they seem so distant now. You really were that angry, that hopeless, and you need to own that. Stop disconnecting from it. Control is so hard to come by in your life, you need to at least have control over **having** a problem.

&gt; Now, on the subject of dealing… Running away from problems isn’t the solution, but neither is confronting them all at once. Ignore those people who say you should sort everything out at once. Take it at your own pace, and deal with one thing at a time, or even half a thing. Remember, the tools given to you aren’t as effective as everyone else’s, so it’ll take more effort to solve your problems. There will be days where you wake up and don’t even want to get out of bed. Be gentle with yourself, and realize that punishing yourself for not pushing hard enough is even more unnecessary strain.

&gt; Between you and me, progress is an uphill battle. You’ll still lie awake at night, years later, thinking about all the things you’ve done wrong. Criticism can still feel like a punch to the gut. You’ll still be angry at yourself for screwing up. You’ll still be angry at other people for not treating you kindly, while simultaneously feeling like you have no right to have such great people in your life. You’ll be aware that your (fairly rock-solid) relationship is really just a fragile thread keeping your head above water. Going to class will still be a struggle. Going to bed before sunrise will happen 75% of the time. Homework assignments will get lost. You’ll have times where you daydream about swerving into oncoming traffic.

&gt; But seriously. Stop it. Just stop. Stop thinking you’re not good enough. Stop focusing on everything that’s wrong with you, and just think about everything that’s gotten better. You have a great life, and just because you still have these issues doesn’t mean you’re ungrateful. You deserve it just as much as anyone else does. **You don’t need to feel guilty.** Despite what you might think, you’re not alone. You’re not normal, but **that’s okay.**

*Phew. To anybody who made it through that with me, thank you. I hope it helped you as much as it helped me. I still have a long way to go before I'll consider myself ""okay,"" but I've come a long way from where I've started, and that feels good. And of course, feel free to share your own experiences.*

1320752657.0,45,self.BipolarReddit,m4pm2,PSA: References to alternative medicine as treatment for bipolar disorder will not be tolerated in this forum. We now need your suggestions to be backed by peer reviewed articles. ,56,11,137,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/m4pm2/psa_references_to_alternative_medicine_as/,"There might be many ways of treating bipolar disorder. The best result would be that the person affected feel better and have a well functioning life. Even though there are standards, treatment will  always be based on a complex set of personal factors - what works for me might not work for you, and vice verse. 


On a regular basis we get posts here in r/bipolarreddit about alternative ways of treating bipolar disorder. Some think that we are the new branch of evolution and that medicine only disturbs our natural abilities. Others think that the moderators of the forum are representatives of “big pharma” and that this causes us to block all posts about alternative treatments. Others again feel that everybody should smoke a lot of weed and that this will fix all our problems. After a discussion, the moderators have decided to make a stand against alternative medicine as a treatment for bipolar disorder.


We wish to address suggestions to treatment of bipolar disorder through various supplements that can be defined as alternative medicine. We, the moderators, believe this forum should try to be based around reason, science and facts. If there are activities, food, herbs or other things people believe people can benefit from - we will accept a debate around this as long as these posts can be backed up by science. If yoga helps you - good! If exercise helps you - great. If smoking weed helps you - ok - but for all cases – if you suggest it as treatment you need to show us some proof that it might help others. This proof should be delivered through references too peer reviewed
articles. But – in the case you suggest that people switch their Lithium with vitamins or sugar pills - your post will be moderated and your account will be followed by the moderators. Why? We think Bluesatin said it well: “If your bipolar was suppressed with multi-vitamins, as far as I'm concerned you were misdiagnosed.” And if you are not even bipolar you should surely not be giving any advice about treatment here in r/bipolarreddit.


“Public acceptance of alternative medicine has been fuelled by a sense of disillusionment many have come to feel toward all authority figures in these troubled times. The rush to dethrone physicians is born of an odd mix of social envy, nostalgia, and disappointment, the latter arising from a number of admittedly over-reaching promises upon which biomedicine has yet to make good. Disaffection has also been prompted by a growing feeling that medical care has become too rushed, overly-technical, and depersonalized. Other detractors are unhappy at the lack of cures for certain chronic conditions which biomedicine does not always manage as well as sufferers might wish. This disenchantment has been intensified in some quarters by a renewed willingness to entertain grand conspiracy theories. An anti-science and anti-physician backlash has resulted from this need to believe that secret plotting on the part of powerful self-serving cabals underlies society’s shortcomings. As a powerful institution with political aims of its own, medicine has filled the role of villain for various conspiracy mongers. Proponents of alternative medicine have been quick to capitalize on this climate of suspicion because it supports their claim that their rejection by orthodox practitioners is merely a ploy to protect the influence and earnings of the medical establishment. Unfortunately, many in their audience seem incapable of separating whatever misgivings they might have about the socio-political activities of doctors as a powerful, self-regulating profession from the question of whether the treatments biomedicine has at its command are genuinely better than those of the “alternatives.” Barry L. Beyerstein, Ph.D.


“Holistic medicine tends to fill the void some feel has been created by the technocratization and depersonalization of orthodox medicine. Alternative healers provide comfort and possibly add to the quality of life for those for whom neither they nor orthodox physicians can offer a cure. Its emphasis on interpersonal relations, healthy lifestyle and disease prevention, and its advocacy of using the least invasive effective remedy are worth encouraging. Alternative practices should continue to be carefully combed for those that can pass scientific scrutiny. However, the “alternatives’” tendency to divert patients from more effective, scientifically proven therapies are costs to them, and its popularization of pseudoscience and magical thinking are costs to us all. The burden of proof remains on the proponents—our demand should always be for objective evidence, for as Francis Bacon warned, “...what a man had rather were true he more readily believes.” Barry L. Beyerstein, Ph.D.



TL:DR   r/bipolarreddit demands that you post links to peer reviewed articles if you are suggesting some way of treating bipolar disorder. Any suggestions that the moderators define as “alternative medicine” will be deleted and the user posting this will be banned.

Over the past few days I've been steadily working through a few months of dishes and other chores to actually clean the house. Here are a few things I've found helpful:

* Don't do everything at once! I'm sure you can do it all in one day when your super manic and you stay up until 5 am scrubbing your bath tub, but it's way harder when you aren't manic. Pacing things out over several days makes it way easier.

* Pick one type of dish and wash all of them. It helps you pace yourself and it also helps with a sense of accomplishment. I like working in this order: plates, bowls, utensils, cups, cookware. If I just do one sink full of dishes I feel like I haven't gotten anything done and don't do dishes the next day.
* Don't hide your dirty dishes! Hiding them is like giving up. If you can't cook because your stove is covered in dishes don't put them in the oven, wash them!
* If you're too depressed to wash dishes use paper/pastic plates. It's much easier to throw things away and take out the trash than to wash dishes. Sure it's wasteful but hey your house will be cleaner. 
* Live with someone who makes you do dishes! My current partner is horrible at this, but when I lived with a friend who was mildly OCD we had a rule that you had to do your dishes within 24 hours and I actually did them! Sure he had to remind me, but I got them done and the place was clean as heck. 
* As SergeantSkittles reminded me, put on something to listen to! If you don't have something in the background you are likely to get bored and stop doing them early. I can't do dishes without music or a movie or tv or anything blaring.

While it's absolutely necessary to admit there may be something wrong - Self-diagnosis can be a damaging experience. This is known as ""[Labeling Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labeling_theory#The_.22mentally_ill.22)"" (a form of self-fulfilling prophecy that may color how you interact with your doctor.)

&gt;[Self-diagnosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-diagnosis) is prone to error and may be potentially dangerous if inappropriate decisions are made on the basis of a misdiagnosis. Because of the risks, self-diagnosis is officially discouraged by governments, physicians, and patient care organizations. Even physicians are discouraged from engaging in self-diagnosis, because doctors too make mistakes in diagnosing themselves. If the self-diagnosis is wrong, then the misdiagnosis can result in improper health care, including wrong treatments and lack of care for serious conditions.

Recognizing there is an issue, and admission, is a HUGE step towards becoming functional again. **But it's incredibly important that you seek professional help with out personal bias.** I know that the Goldberg Questionnaire is listed on the side bar, and this may help you get perspective, you need to realize that **you are not qualified to definitively diagnose yourself.** That Abilify, Celexa, Zoloft, or Cymbalta commercial might seem like it's everything you've ever felt, but that's the point. They are trying to sell you a product.

We don't want you to feel like you are being looked down on. Remember that anyone on /r/BP is willing to lend an ear, and we will support people with any mental illness with the same vigor and empathy. But we cannot stress enough how important it is to avoid online tests, surface articles, and armchair psychologists in the quest to get treatment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**STEPS TO GETTING TREATMENT**

1. **Seek out a psychologist for initial diagnosis.** Typically they will delve deeper than a psychiatrist in this regard, and then bringing this perspective to a Psychiatrist can smooth the whole process. It may take numerous view points to fully realize your condition. *DO NOT SEE A GENERAL PRACTITIONER.* A GP may be familiar with mental health, but is not qualified to diagnose. You may be given medication that could exasperate your condition.

2. **Outline a time frame of when you remember feeling this way.**

3. **Jot down events, interpersonal or otherwise, that highlight the issue.**

4. **Make a list of ""out of the ordinary"" symptoms you have noticed.** This may range from changes in sleep patterns to sexual addiction to consistent irritability. Steps 1 - 3 will help your doctor diagnose and gauge the severity of the situation.

5. **Make a log of your progress week over week after your initial doctor visits.** Note how therapy has adjusted your ability to cope, and how your medication is affecting you. It will help in the long term until you are able to recognize and explain your progression to your doctor. Share this information during your appointments.

6. **Never stop taking or adjust your medication without consulting your psychiatrist.** Many medications require ""step down"" periods, side effects from too much or too little of a medication, or there may be alarming changes as you move from one medication to the next.

1325536127.0,41,self.BipolarReddit,o052y,[UPDATE] Asked for advice about a year and a half ago about starting a relationship with someone who has bipolar disorder. Thought you might be interested in an update. ,47,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/o052y/update_asked_for_advice_about_a_year_and_a_half/,"link to original thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/dppm6/just_had_a_great_second_date_with_someoneuntil/

First, I want to thank those of you who responded to (ignorant at the time) me. It was very encouraging to hear from so many who said that it doesn't have to be (and shouldn't be) a dealbreaker. 

Just thought I'd post an update that we're still dating! I've learned so many things about bipolar disorder in the past year and a half. I've seen her lows, her very lows, her highs, her psychosis, and everything in between. It's not easy. It's pretty freakin' hard, actually. But I will say it's all been worth it.

A quick update: 
-She finished school and reduced her work hours, which helped tremendously. 

-She became more and more receptive to the idea of seeing a doctor... as of right now, she found a psychiatrist at a local health center who is working with her free of charge after hearing her situation (so thankful there's docs out there like this!) 

-She's currently having success with an antipsychotic+antidepressant, although recently she's been having a bit of anxiety with the antidepressant. (no signs of induced mania though. her psychiatrist was sure to advise both me and her to watch for signs of that) The key to changing her perspective about treatment was when the psychiatrist prescribed her something that actually made her feel better. If you're currently trying to find something, don't give up -- this was the 5th or 6th medication she tried before finding one without horrible side effects, that actually improved her symptoms. 

Don't let anyone tell you that having bipolar disorder condemns you to being foreveralone. If someone you're interested in is scared off after they find out, it's either because they're ignorant, or they're not worth it in the first place. 

It seems like most of the people on this subreddit are those who have bipolar disorder -- I'd be happy to answer any questions that someone might have, from the perspective of being in a serious relationship with someone affected with bipolar disorder type 1.

How do you feel?,47,6,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/sxrqx/i_hate_when_people_say_suicide_is_selfish_how_do/,"It is frequently said that suicide is selfish and cowardly, a permanent response to a temporary problem. In many cases, this is true - but I feel that there are exceptions. Those of us who experience severe major depressive episodes understand how traumatic of an experience it can be - those feelings of despair, loneliness, hopelessness, the way your entire body feels cold and numb, finding yourself curled up on the floor weeping and becoming physically ill with absolutely no provocation....it's absolutely horrid and most of the rest of the world has no idea how lucky they are never to feel this way. And the worst part is knowing that this will continue for your entire life, medication and therapy can make it happen less often but it will never go away. For many of us, that is enough, but for those of us more deeply affected we know that there is no real chance of ever finding a ""happily ever after"" - any happiness is transitory at best. And even when we're up it isn't necessarily any better - we lose control of our thoughts and actions, and this loss of control is terrifying. So why should those of us in that position, so deeply troubled by our illness, be called selfish for wanting the pain to stop? Why must we wait for decades (depending on age) of more suffering before it can end? I don't feel that this is selfish. Those who want us to continue living like this just so they won't be sad to see us go are the ones who are truly being selfish - whether they realize it or not, they are wishing years of suffering upon us.

What do you think? Do you agree or are these the nonsensical ramblings of someone who is depressed and desperate? I for one only stay alive because those close to me have guilted me into it, and I resent them for it.

I've got that personal experience, and to say the least, its not fun.

Probably was the scariest fucking thing I have ever experienced.

According to the doctors and pill counts, I swallowed almost 3200mg of this stuff, which is something I was put on as a teenager to help with my bipolar disorder. 
Septmber 20th, I went over the edge and started downing pills. 2 x 2 with red kooliad....To this day I still can't touch red koolaid without throwing up.

So down then went, me crying my eyes out, I started texting my boyfriend telling him what was going on. about 15minutes later things started to go nuts...

First it felt like gravity was cut in half...my head was swaying around and I couldn't walk straight...then the lights started to get bright and things started spinning a bit... at that point I freaked out and called 911, because I knew I was so scared of what was happening.

Then I colasped on the front porch clinging for dear life to the railing as the world around me started literally spinning around.
I ended up pulling several of the wooden bracers off the porch railing completely un aware of what was going on. 
The paramedics had arrived by then and they started to do testing and discovered I wasn't able to walk.
After they got me into he ambulance the spinning went to fullon rollercoaster dips and dives, like I was in an acrobatic airplane.
After that memories became so blurred. I remember shrill screams of fear and panic.
but This wasn't over yet.
about 45minutes in, I lost muscular coordination and my musucle movements were so exaggerated that I was unintenitally punching and kicking people.
I remember at one point trying to scratch my noise and my arm cam flying up in my face so hard that I busted my lip open and gave myself a gushing bloody noise.
I remember just crying and screaming ""I'm sorry I'm sorry please don't leave me here""
I also remember trying fuirtlessly to stop the spinning and gravity shift with my feet, pushing on the bed frames with enough force to sprain both my ankles.

Then came the throwing up. which was isnanely painful. My eyes hurt so bad from the lighting, I couldn't keep them open.
2 police officers were holding me down as the violent thrashing was getting too dangerous for people to be near me and with medical equipment and the already several bloodied lacerations on my wrists and hands they had to hold me down until I tied down to a hospital bed.
And then finally came the insane fear and paranoia. I was so scared of being seen naked, because the police had stripped me down, so they could do emergency testing. I kept trying desperately to keep myself covered up. Like I was going to be throwin in prison for being naked in public. I ended up wraping the blankets so tightly around my body the nurses were afraid I was going to end up choking myself to death.
Every noise made me scream with fear, every little movement around me was charged with someone tyring to kill me or rape me.
I was so scared and the world was so insanely spinning 
And then....

Nothing. I had finally sucomb to the drugs affects. I was slipping away.

I spent a week in the ICU, being pumped full of saline and anti toxins, some of to doctors apparently thought I wasn't going to survive so they didn't pump my stomach with charcoal.

They simply hooked me up to IV's and hoped it would help. The simply didn't know if I was going to survive so the nurses tried to make it as comfortably as possible for me as I died.
but my body had ejected enough of the drug durning the vomiting spells that there wasn't enough to be absorded to be lethal.

I woke up 6days later in the ICU, completely unable to move, I couldn't talk, I couldn't walk or even tell where I was.

over the next few days I was moved to a high risk unit and was watched closely as I slowly regained consciousness.
I spent another week being helped around because I couldn't walk yet.
After I was stable enough I was sent to the mental health unit to be evaluated and tested.
3 1/2 weeks in the hospital.

and now no doctor will prescribe me lamictal, which was one of the only drugs that had ever helped me, because I OD'd on it.

I'm not sure if this belongs here, but I hope it at least seems related and it's worth an insight to the kind of drugs were dealing with when being treated for bipolar disorder.",,False,,t5_2qzru,1363445072.0,,,True,t3_1aerkp,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1aerkp/what_its_like_to_overdose_on_lamictal_lamotrigine/,

WOW. I guess I'm not the only one. Thanks guys for replying; this is relatively frequent symptom for me, if that's what it is, and I've got to say sometimes I'd take the soul-ripping depression over this any day because the urge to just destroy my everydayness and do a bunk and some stupid stuff is pretty difficult to resist sometimes. I think, I don't know, I'm only recently diagnosed BPDII rapid cycling, but I think that this is definitely something that pre-empts or maybe results from something or other, I can't tell, I know that's a bit lame but I can't quite get to diarying my moods yet because I don't want to see how it really is. It means a ton though to know I'm not the only one that gets this; what you've said has made me go oh yeah, you too, and even if it's not exactly the same and why would it be, the point is that I'm not the only one. The way my moods are, now I know there's something wrong with them, is actually pretty hard to deal with. I've taken the edge off this one by drinking, yeah I know, not smart when I've just started quetiapine but I cannot bear feeling that way and I had to take the edge off; I self-harmed last night and I don't want to do that again- it's best described as like squeezing an orange and all that comes out is gallons of pus. If anyone's reading this at all and eating too then sorry for the vile image. It's a horrible way to feel; I think if it was only a couple of degrees another way then I'd be quitting my job and selling my house to some bloke on the bus for a grand; I guess it's pretty near mania, really, it's just so intense but so brief too, maybe 36 hours at the most. It'd be easier if the edges between before and after weren't so sharp; I haven't identified how I feel immediately before and after but all I know is that all of a sudden I just HATE life and can't relate to it and fiercely don't want it; it feels something akin to starting a new school that I instantly know I'm going to hate.

I have now been stable for over a year but still have panic attacks. I am 20 and in college. I completed my first semester of college last semester after a few attempts that ended with me in the hospital. Needless to say, i was scared to go back at first. I acquired my first PSD a few weeks before starting classes. He was already trained for a friend of mine who had semi-retired him, not because of his age, but because she was barely having attacks anymore. So he was offered to me to see if it would help me get through the day. I worked with him and learned how to be a handler and then i started school. It wasn't easy, but my dog was there for me every time i needed him. He made it possible for me to get through an attack and get on with my day. It changed my life. I was able to complete all of my courses and finished my first semester of college. I was so happy after my last final that i just sat there and cried and held my dog. (people were stopping to ask if i was ok lol) Since then, i got my own dog (a border collie named Tonks who is 6 months old now) and have been working closely with a trainer to teach her to help me the same way that the first one did. I start classes on August 20th and so far, Tonks is more than prepared to help me. I am excited to face the world with my own little panic warrior at my side. I wish I could have known how amazing these dogs could be before all of this happened. I just wanted to spread the word and try to share my happiness with everyone else so that they too could benefit from it.

Saturday, I graduated with a bachelors in the Classics and a minor in creative writing.

After spending two years in a Lexapro-induced hypomania with horrendous, though infrequent, bouts of depression and mania, I was taken off the Lexapro at the beginning of my senior, I crashed. It was most assuredly the worst four months of my life. I lived on someone else's couch because I couldn't be alone. I cried every day for several hours. My average rating on the How-Much-Would-You-Care-If-You-Died-Today scale stayed around a 2.

However, with the help of two incredible doctors, here I am. After many, many failed attempts with medicines such as Lamictal and Abilify, my psychiatrist finally put me on Lithium. I guess you could say I have a love-hate relationship with it. I've thrown up in three buildings on campus because of it. I shake all the time, I get disoriented fairly easily, I'm always thirsty--these are just some of the side-effects I have dealt with. Yet, it worked for me (along with a couple other things). I stopped crying. I went home. I pulled my shit together and passed all my classes for that semester. My psychologist was there the whole time, ready to talk or listen, always teaching and guiding me through the dark spots in my understanding of myself and my disorder. He taught me that just because I'm bipolar does not mean that I am any less capable. Two very amazing and wonderful people, these two doctors.

Anyway, my last semester was pretty normal. I reconnected with my friends. I went out and partied. I pulled all-nighters. I didn't cry every morning. I guess where I am going is this way, toward the inspirational side of the life-story telling room. It's okay for things to be hard. Really, it is. You're not the only person crying for no reason, nor are you the only person digging yourself into a deep hole of debt because you just had to this or that. We're all struggling in some way. Success is just a matter of seeing that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Every bad decision you make will one day lead you to a good decision. There is something good in store of every single of us, whether we can imagine it or not. Life isn't over because you're in the darkness right now. It just means you better learn to appreciate the sun.

Living this life never gets easier. But you learn more bout yourself and observe more about the world than anyone else because of it. Let gifts make it worth it.

|

Last night, I was driving around with my brother by our house and as I was pulling up to our neighborhood,  I was stopped by police.  My registration was expired, I was aware, but the cop insisted I was on a substance,

|

After being taken from the car and questioned, they asked if I was on any medication so I told them, lithium for bipolar disorder.  They then had me do the tests to check if I was impaired and told me that I failed, handcuffed me and put me in the car.

|

At that time, my brother was questioned by one of the officers and told them the same story.  He asked the officers what was going to happen to me and was told that they were debating taking me in to a drug recognition expert to see if he can determine if I was on anything and then for a blood test.  Brother didn't like that answer and wanted to know why I'd definitely be going for a blood test if there was the 'possibility' the expert didn't find a problem.  Seriously.. if they are already planning it, why bother doing all other crap in between.

|

After leaving my brother and my car, they went behind their cruiser and discussed whether or not to let me go.  At this point I can hear everything from inside the car.  They started talking about how I didn't do anything out of the norm and that the fact that my brother and I talked about bipolar disorder and lithium they were taking me in... which confused the hell out of me.

|

Scare tactics aside and a 30 minute drive later, I end up at a facility with the expert.  As soon as I walk through the door and was seated, the expert looked at me, asked if I wanted to come clean to which I replied,I was not on anything.

|

A little over an hour of testing later, the expert, along with the other 4 cops sitting in the room couldn't pinpoint what was causing my large pupils and my irregular heartbeat.  The expert told the other officers that I must be on some sort of strange stimulant possibly mixed with a depressant, but it could be marijuana.  So.. as the saying goes, guilty until proven innocent.  The recognition expert calls in a blood test for all three.

|

40 Minute drive to county jail now.

|

Get my fingerprints taken, get my blood taken, and then thrown in a holding cell.

|

Finally, after that, they call me a taxi and send me home two hours before I needed to be up for work.  :D

|

Anyway, their suspicions coupled with my neglect to renew my registration caused them to tow my car rather than move it about 30 houses forward to where I live.

|

Bipolar disorder cost me $150 and a day of work.  Thank you state troopers for being awesome.

|

Sorry for the rant, but whether you believe my side of the story or not, I was not irrational and I complied with everything that was requested of me.  I just wanted the community to know that, depending on how bipolar disorder affects you, be it mentally or a physical abnormality, you may be playing through life at a disadvantage even when you're functioning completely normally.

I do stand up comedy at local bars and crack jokes about myself. Call it a weird sense of humor, but for me laughter is the best medicine.

Anyone else?

He said he hates who I have become (I quit drinking and drugs, lost 50lbs, mood swings under control). He said I'm not who he married and since I don't want to go back to that and will probably just keep changing that we should start figuring a way out of the marriage.

1342579250.0,31,self.BipolarReddit,wql3j,Things I've Learned Since Getting Diagnosed With Bipolar Disorder...,33,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/wql3j/things_ive_learned_since_getting_diagnosed_with/,"I was diagnosed with mixed-episode, rapid-cycling, bipolar disorder last year. I haven’t learned everything about dealing with this yet, but here’s some lessons I’ve learned the hard way.

1) Learning how to deal with bipolar disorder is often a case of trial and error.

This can refer to finding a medication combination that works (I’m currently on my third try of medication) or finding ways to cope with the complexities of this disorder on a day to day basis. You have to find things, activities, people, that can help you get through each day, and so often this process lacks consistency. Writing helps me cope—I’ve found that it’s much easier for me to write about things I still can’t talk about. It helps me get the overwhelming tide of feelings out.

Find something that helps you feel a little bit free. This will most likely not happen in one day, but don’t let that convince you that you can’t find something,


2) Be kind to yourself.

For me (partly because my story includes abuse), this one’s really hard. It’s hard not to feel completely demoralized when I have days when I can’t leave the house, can’t get out of bed, and have to cancel plans at the last minute. I get trapped in a horrible cycle of thinking, one that leaves me convinced that I’ll die alone with wild dogs fighting themselves over snacking on my dead body. Right now, when I’m not symptomatic, this seems funny; when I’m drowning in my mind, it feels inevitable.

Even if being kind to yourself feels stupid, pointless, and like a waste of time, you should still do it.

What this can look like: buying yourself a cupcake, watching a great movie, painting your toenails, taking a hot shower, going for a walk, making a playlist of songs that make you happy, or something else entirely. 

3) Have a plan of action for when things get really, really, really bad.

Bipolar disorder has one of the highest suicide rates for any mental disorder. Take steps to keep yourself safe. No matter what, you are worth protecting, even if this means saving you from yourself. I’ve had plenty of moments where that previous sentence felt like a terrible cliche, or like a nice statement that was great for everyone else, but not for me. 

This is going to look different for everyone else. Here’s what I do.

I am unbelievably lucky to have two best friends, who are beyond patient and supportive of me. One has made it clear that I can come over to her house whenever I feel unsafe or am horribly upset, and the other best friend is the person I call or text when I feel beyond repair. (I also have a therapist (who I love) and a psychiatrist (who I’m not so fond of), FYI.) I’ve spent two full years in CBT (cognitive-based therapy) and try to find a way to handle the emotional changes myself, but when I can’t, I ask for help.

DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP.

That works for me when I’m depressive. When I’m manic, I’ve learned to try other things. Mania looks different for everyone. For me, I’m anxious, paranoid, talkative (I’ll stutter or repeat things), irritable, and the like. I have too much energy, and the slightest thing (a post on Facebook, someone not responding to a text message as quickly as I’d like, etc.) will set me off. I’ve learned not to have a ringer or even vibrate on my phone—sometimes the unpredictability of the buzzing will make me incredibly nervous.

Occasionally, I will have to put my manic self in time-out, as I’ve grown to call it. It’s the only way to keep myself from saying something I’ll regret or doing something foolish. I’ll turn off my phone (no longer than three days—no need to make people worry) and won’t sign into Facebook or Twitter. I’ll spend that time re-reading over parts in my CBT book and generally doing things to calm myself down. When I feel ready, I’ll re-enter the digital world. 

I’ve done this three times. It really helps.

What do you want from your life? Do you want hospitalization, drugs, the label bipolar?   Highs and lows can be very normal. Do something about it and move on with your life. Dwelling on what type of bipolar you are if you are bipolar is a waste of time. Do counseling, learn to cope and move on to the important facets of adult life. You have a great life ahead, don't let this ruin it for you. Learn coping skills and move on- I see folks everyday that become addicted to drugs,alcohol, sex who lose everything and everyone because they get hung up on the diagnoses but cannot commit to the cure - learning coping and behavior modification skills.""

I submitted my entry May 1st (the due date, of course) and in mid-May they announced that I tied for first with a girl from Indonesia, the runner-ups from San Diego and Pakistan. My essay was extremely anecdotal and personal; whereas the Indonesian's was very technical and statistical. The prompt was based around how one would go about eradicating stigma by 2020.

I won $500 and read my essay at a public forum near the headquarters of the IBF, and I met and talked with former Congressman Patrick Kennedy (the late president's nephew), a huge advocate for mental health awareness and fairness. He *really* liked my essay. And I got to take pictures with him, which was awesome.

This is just one example of the fact that mental illness doesn't have to stop you from achieving goals and improving as a person. And people who suffer and recover from mental illness have a unique perspective on life and suffering, and **should not live under the shadow of other's ignorance.**

Here is the essay: 

*""My World Is Your World""*

I walk into class, my shield a thick blue binder filled with my countless ideas and thoughts; my nature in disorganized paper form. Inside hide the pictures of relief- Cobain, Poe, Whitman, Twain. Others. Success stories. Reminders of what is possible inside my world. Our world.

The bipolar world.

I sit, my own little planet, and watch the passionate pleas and anecdotes- “Ban the ‘R Word’”, “Words Hurt”, “If You Only Knew Me”- on the student television show. I recognize their causes and struggles with a mixture of great respect and weary indifference. I’ve heard it all before, I’ve seen the beauty of social progression towards
acceptance.

But there’s something missing.

Enter May- Mental Health Awareness month. My mind has become increasingly preoccupied with the serious lack of education and consideration in the public school system for mental health awareness.

One could say that I have experienced the full and direct effect of such prevalent ignorance amongst today’s youth.

I received the diagnosis of Type II Bipolar Disorder at the young age of thirteen. For nearly four years I catapulted through the air; soaring up and up and up, only to plummet back down to Earth, back to avoiding friends and feeling listless and empty. Bipolar disorder has been described as “the worst hell imaginable”, and I could not agree more.

That is why I take offense to the erroneous vision of mental illness. The stigmatized, generalized, and absolutely searing use of ‘bipolar’ in everyday speech. Especially when the label is met with such horror and protest, such disgust at the very thought of being “crazy”, a daily experience I find to be incredibly upsetting and painful. I know that I am not alone in this.

Society has painted such a “comprehensive” portrait of this disorder; people can hardly tear their eyes from it. They refuse to listen or attempt to modify their reinforced views.

Some things need to change. By 2020, I want people to catch themselves when a bipolar label starts to slip off their tongues, and I want the label to be recognized as the derogatory and hateful term that it is. I want society recognize the physical nature of the disorder; to capitalize on the strengths of an individual with bipolar disorder instead of seeing the disorder as a weakness or a horrific flaw.

In order to do so, the public school system needs to implement awareness programs into their curriculum for young students. Reinforcement of a concept can have positive repercussions- we learn the social inappropriateness of the ‘N’ word and the archaic term “retarded” at a young age. Why not “bipolar”? Though progress of consciousness is slow moving, if we start now, we are that much closer to ending the stigma. I no longer want to feel ashamed and afraid of my identity, and I want the silent community of people like me to shed their fear and embrace their identity for our world to see.


Looking back at it, I admit it is corny. Since then, I have also been announced as a finalist in an international poetry contest. Naturally, it's about the past horrors of my illness. 

Let's work together to keep fighting the stigma!!

Edit: 
Here is the poem. This is the original one I wrote, the entry was shorter (they had a limit on number of lines). I find out if I won in early September.


*A Goodbye*



For me it started as thus;

A fire

Low and beautiful 

Jumping up

Catching the walls 

Growing brighter

A glorious inferno

A thousand spiraling words 

Pouring into my eyes

The brilliance of colours that I could not name 

Clothes removed in a high speed chase 

The warmth of euphoria and false love

At once all-consuming and terrifying 

A blazing, spinning sun,

Now careening, 

Falling towards the earth

The walls crumble and collapse inward

And I am left in darkness.



For all the brightness in the world

This- yes, this was the darkness. 

This was the inevitability of a stone sinking

To the bottom of the deepest ocean.

This was the other blindness.



Caressed by tears

In a chokehold of empty space 

A sea of blankets and dark eyes


Knowing nothing. 

Seeing nothing. 



The never-filled plate

Piled high with worry and need 

I’m feeding a hole that only grows. 




Hands pass me by

No; I don’t want to play today. 

There is nothing- 

There will only be nothing.  



The many possibilities in the kitchen 

Give to me temporarily 

What I need 

Permanently. 



Peace.

All I want is peace. 



Looking back at the thing now

You and I 

We murdered friendships

Achieved brilliance 

Longed for death

Stopped time. 



To the monster that I knew so well-

Goodbye, Bipolar Hell.

AmA,32,3,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/wxk1x/i_ended_a_suicidal_depressive_episode_with_dxm_i/,"Prompted by the [recent article about an NMDA antagonist](http://psychcentral.com/news/2012/05/31/ketamine-relieves-bipolar-depression-suicidal-thoughts-in-less-than-an-hour/39472.html) relieving suicidal depression in bipolars, I decided to guinea pig a chemical similar to ketamine: dextrorphan. Dextrorphan is a metabolite of dextromethorphan HBr, which can be found in most over the counter cough syrups. I have had experience with this drug in the past, and have spent hours upon hours giving myself the proper information needed to take the drug safely.

During an awful suicidal depression, I administered myself DXM at a blood concentration of ~6mg/kg steady over the course of two days. This ended the depressive episode and stabilized me for the next 36 hours. I would have killed myself if I had not tried this drug.

I have spoken with my psychologist, who commended me for my resourcefulness. I saw him the day after I ended self-medication with DXM and he confirmed that I was more stable than he had seen me in a long time. I will be speaking with my psychiatrist about the study mentioned above as well as my experiment. I will be repeating my experiment today as I am slipping back into a depressive episode.

There you have it. I feel that NMDA antagonists are a hopeful source of future relief for bipolars. I believe new antidepressants based on this technique will be the most effective treatment for bipolar depression we have seen yet.

I do not condone what I am doing to mitigate my symptoms. I am in desperation and trying to keep myself alive. I have a large knowledge base about the chemicals I'm using and how they interact with my medication. I am here only to inform and possibly give hope.

I've started a list of things my manic self has taught me about my normal self, along with tips for helping myself when manic/depressed in the future. Doing this has helped me to feel like the time I spend in episodes is not a complete waste. Here's a few:

(written as advice to myself, from myself)

1. When you have the choice, choose confidence. There's no point in selling yourself short and people are attracted to it.
2. Don't take life too seriously. Recognize the absurd and find humor in it. Recognize the beauty and find awe. Let things amaze you.
3. Let others who care about you have input. Your judgement isn't always as good as you think it is.
4. Always keep a creative project in the works.  It keeps you interesting and driven.

Thank-you all for your thoughtful comments and help.

This morning I talked with my the mental health resource people in my employee assistance program at work, and they are hooking me up with a counselor for either myself or both of us to try to help deal with  the situation.  A qualified person is supposed to be calling me Tues or Wed.  They strongly suggested I get my wife to the hospital for an assessment as quickly as possible, as the mood swings can change rapidly and there is the possibility that she could become violent in the future.

I called the local health authority to find out what to do next, and found out my options were limited unless I could convince her to go voluntarily.  Again, they stressed the importance of getting her to the hospital as soon as possible.

I talked to my wife, and told her that based on the calls I had, I needed to get her to the hospital to talk to a doctor, and that the nurse I spoke to had told me that I should not leave her alone with our girls until she had done so.

I added that if the doctor thought that you were Ok, that this should be a short visit.

She was quiet for a while, and then finally agreed to go.  It still took close to an hour to get her actually moving to go to the hospital, but she wasn't resisting going.

I couldn't find anyone to watch the kids, so they came along too -- which turned into a good thing, because they were giving her lots of hugs, and keeping her comforted.

After a few hours, she was brought in to see the psychiatric nurse (the doctor still hadn't arrived, so they started with the nurse interviewing her).  After a bit, the nurse came out to talk to me, and was surprised (and happy) that I had a written timeline of what happened when.  She took it off (and I presume copied it).  

When she returned, she asked the kids and I to go into the room with my wife, and she would talk to us together.  When I got in there, I was surprised at how disoriented my wife had become.  I'm assuming its because of the exhaustion (she has hardly slept at all for the past few days).

We were interviewed together, with the nurse asking me to expand on some of my wife's answers.  I tried to stay quiet unless something was directed to me.  It was *so* hard when I could see her struggling to string her thoughts together.

Partway through the doctor came in, and continued the interview.  One of his focuses was trying to see if she was hearing things or not (she claimed not to be, and she has never told me that she had).

He asked her if she would stay overnight and take some medication to help her sleep.  She (surprisingly to me) agreed.  He prescribed two medications, in his words a major and a minor tranquilizer (one started with an O, the other an L, but I forgot to write it down at the time, and he disappeared shortly after).  They also took blood-work to try to check for physical causes.

She is now in the hospital sleeping.  She agreed to one day, but the nurse told me to bring several changes of clothes, so we will see what it turns out to be.

I don't have any sort of a diagnosis from the hospital yet.  The nurses in the Mental Health Unit said that the direction from the doctor at this point is to get her rested.

One comment that the nurse made was complimenting me for doing the right thing so quickly.  Apparently it normally takes much longer before the professionals get involved.

Thank-you to you all for helping me find the right things to do, and encouraging me to get them done.  Dealing with it to this stage was unbelievably hard.  I broke down crying when I was calling the different places to find out what I should do (but managed to get myself under control and get calm again when I needed to deal with my wife and kids.)

Edit:  Learned one thing new today.  For here (Manitoba), even though she checked in voluntarily, and was told one night to get some rest, now that she's in, she can not check herself out.

This is important because suddenly stopping a medication may lead to ""rebound,"" or worsening of bipolar disorder symptoms. Other uncomfortable or potentially dangerous withdrawal effects are also possible.

However.
  
I got all my stuff out, I mean EVERYTHING out before bedtime. Unheard of. Usually I'd be working till 3am or 4am, stop exhausted, then wake up early to finish and race around and end up late to work. 

I'm kinda stressed about moving everything back because it's thrown into boxes and baskets kinda randomly, but it's done.

I can't believe I'm 40 and this is what I'm excited about. But whatever. It's just really nice to get a good night's sleep.

Here goes:

""You know, in 1997, a researcher working in the Artic found two identical snowflakes. True story. It's kinda sad, really, if you think about it with my level of cynicism. How many times have you heard something relating to the uniqueness of snowflakes, only to learn that it was all wrong, snowflakes can match. While not specifically a lie, it melds into other things we have been told such as Santa Clause and The Easter Bunny. We're raise in the country, hell this world to believe certain things. What goes up must come down, water is wet, the sky is blue, and sex is a good thing. However, when you realize the actual truth of it all, none of these things matter.

What matters are the things that can change. Serenity is not freedom from the storm, it is peace within the storm. You have to learn to look at things from every single angle, even if it is something you disagree with. Take Charge! The next time you have an impulse to do something, DO IT! Life has become less and less of a joy to experience and more of a back breaking chore and that is fundamentally WRONG. Buy a puppy or a kitten, if you have a crush on someone, grab them and kiss them for no particular reason. Turn off the TV and go for a walk. Get off the phone and take a bubble bath. It is moments like these, when one realizes the true singularity of the soul, that really matters.

Twenty years from now, when you look back and think what you have accomplished, you can say to yourself that while you may not be right or you may not be super smart or you may not be married, etc, you enjoyed every tiny moment of your life in some way and that is worth more than all the gold at Fort Knox. Knowledge and happiness are the true treasures.

Reality is a cold scary place full of big monsters with nasty teeth and bad breath, but you can whack those fuckers with bricks of contentment. Above all, just take it easy. You've only got one life, as far as we know, so instead of worrying about all the trivial little headgames, breathe easy, and slow down. Once you can say to yourself ""hey, self. I think we're gonna be okay:, then you will realize that happiness is the ability to enjoy yourself, and it is a sad thing that very few people realize that.

She was growing apathetic about life, work, school, and our relationship. She didn't feel any drive to be ""relationshipy"". We're both bipolar, and about 2 months into our relationship I found out she had a coke habit. I asked her a few times before this because there were signs around her room, but she insisted she wasn't using. She eventually fessed up to it. That should have been the end of our relationship, but I decided to give her time to tell her doctor and work things out. Right up until the end she still hadn't told him. 

On Tuesday morning I called her psych and told him she had a drug problem because I wanted him to be able to treat her properly, and I cared about her getting help. I had every reason to believe she wasn't going to tell him anytime soon, if ever.

It turns out that she was driving drunk Tuesday night and hit another car, fled the scene, and turned herself in Wednesday (didn't wind up being jailed). At that point I told her flat out that she had a problem and needed to get help. She agreed and said she wouldn't drink for again for a while.

I only did this because I care about her deeply and want her to get help. Did I do the right thing here?

The first few visits were really rough, especially since she would say things that I'd never heard her say before and act in ways I'd never seen. She started her medicine again, and slowly but surely started to get better. Three months later, today, she is functioning amazingly! She finishes her last quarter of school this January, already volunteers at a museum and just this Sunday, went to a very close friend's birthday party- a friend whom she thought hated her. I'm a bit of a makeup/nail person and she's even let me do her makeup and nails for her recently, something she'd never let me have done in the past!

1376409480.0,27,self.BipolarReddit,1ka8hn,Have you been to a mental health support group? I went last night for the first time.,29,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1ka8hn/have_you_been_to_a_mental_health_support_group_i/,"The Give and the Take

Recently, I went to my first mental health support group meeting. I must admit I was nervous. What would people talk about? What would people think of me? Would I have to talk? If so, what would I say? Though I've never been afraid to speak my mind, this was different. I was actually nervous to tell my story. That is, until I started hearing the other stories. I quickly realized that there are a lot of people right here in my community who live with bigger challenges than mine.

The meeting was held in a nearby church inside a small conference room. Chairs and love seats were turned inward surrounding a coffee table filled with mental health pamphlets and a strategically placed box of tissues. We were a circle of solemn faces, some young, some older, some in pairs, some alone. And we were united with one goal: support for the mental illness affecting our lives.
There were tragic stories of loss as well as inspiring stories of hope. Mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, friends. Each of us, in clockwise order, took our turn guided by the encouraging kindness of our group leader. Some had lots to say, while others uttered very little. It was obvious who had told their stories before. Theirs were told with stoic poise and sometimes slightly uncomfortable humor. Those who were new to this were obvious too, as tears streamed down their faces as they spoke of their suffering.

Since I sat nearest to the group leader, I didn't share until last. Secretly, part of me hoped we would run out of time so I wouldn't have to say anything. But another part of me was anxious to speak, to share the grief that clouded the room.

“I'm here because of my son. In the fall of 2010 he wanted to kill himself...” I began to tell my story aloud for the very first time. Sure, I had told it in pieces to my loved ones and friends over the last couple of years. I'd written many posts on my blog, too, but never had I laid it out so openly, so raw, to a group of total strangers.
I told them everything. My voice quivered as I told them about the gun my son acquired at the mental hospital. Tears swelled up when I confessed the fear I felt for my very own child. My stomach clenched as I spoke so freely. My story just told itself.

My listeners were more than kind. They hung on my every word. They nodded in recognition of my feelings, my experiences, my story. They chuckled at my attempts to lighten up such a heavy topic. And they shared the tissue box.

When I'd poured out everything, I was surprised at how I felt. It wasn't a void of losing something I'd been secretly harboring so long, but instead, a renewed sense of strength that had grown inside of me. I'd emptied my heart into the laps of strangers and in return, I'd gained hope and understanding from them. I was even marked a “success”, a “survivor” a “model of strength”. The people there listened to my story with hope of learning something from me. That's what was the most surprising. While I attended the meeting hoping to find support, after sharing, I discovered I actually provided support and hope to others. That was the best part of all.

Personally, I thought I was God, or Jesus Christ, or the second coming of Christ, or a prophet. I think any of us who have experienced this have wondered why.

Is anyone religious but non-christian? What was your God delusion like? I'm guessing the Jesus thing is not universal, but it does affect non-religious people like myself. Why didn't I ever think I was Mohammed, or Buddha?

But that doesn't answer the question of why we have this delusion in the first place. I will offer my opinion and would love to hear any other. During mania, our brains are absorbing and processing much more information than normal. We are making connections and finding patterns that are not really there. For example, when I am manic I see familiar faces in those of strangers. Everything must have a meaning. Everything is connected to something else. Well, the explanation for all of these thoughts doesn't exist, but we need an explanation nonetheless. I think that by calling yourself God, you have found a convenient way to ""explain"" or make sense of all of your irrational beliefs, which is that everything is happening to your liking, therefore nothing really needs an explanation. Bipolar people become god during mania to feel comfortable with the unknown, just like religious non-bipolar people believe in God for the same reason. The amazing thing is that even non-religious people are forced to believe in god during mania, by becoming god itself, which I think indicates a deeper understanding of what God reflects: the unknown.

The second day, the starting side effects got to be pretty bad and combined with the depression I was already experiencing, I found myself unable to go to work that day. I texted my supervisor (who knows that I am bipolar) to let him know what was happening. I normally just say ""I'm sick"" or ""Not feeling well,"" but this time, I told him that I tried new meds and they were making me feel ill. 

He said that was fine, but of course I felt guilty and stressed and pathetic all day. I felt like I'd be in trouble for missing work for this. However, the next day when I went in, my supervisor was very kind and understanding. He asked me if my side effects were getting better and took note that I was still feeling a little spacey. He also asked me some questions about my new medications. He seemed genuinely interested. It was a great feeling to not only be open about what I had felt needed to be a secret source of stress, but also to educate someone about some of the extra things I deal with due to my disorder. He had never needed medicine like I do, but he understood how it must suck to have to take pills to make you functional... that also sometimes make you feel crappy.

His choice to be kind and understanding really touched me. I'm not saying we should all go around talking about Bipolar to every person we meet, but sometimes I think we don't give others a fair chance to understand.

I saw my pdoc today. I wasn't quite sure what to make of how I was (and am) feeling. A weird hypomania, but somehow without the irritability, without being easily perturbed by outside influences, and able to maintain a clear, focused train of thought and conversation. That's what I figured it must be at least. After all, if I'm happy and motivated, it must be hypomania. But I've never felt quite like this before. She said she's seen me through a few different states (true on account of my rapid cycling) and that she thought I seemed stable for once. Is this actually ""me""?

Well, Finagle's Law came along and gave the hypothesis a stress test pretty quickly. I accidentally poured windshield washer fluid into my car's brake fluid reservoir and had to get it towed. Didn't beat myself up about it or freak out. Then I found out almost every auto repair place was closed for the weekend. And I didn't completely freak out. Took half a Klonopin as a precautionary measure just to stay ahead of what I was sure would be a delayed anxiety attack any minute. Had to call my dad about dealing with it since it's his insurance policy (he's co-signer on the title). Didn't freak out or get pissed off dealing with him and didn't ruminate over our bad history or the nasty things I've said to him. Got it towed, found out I might have to get the whole brake fluid system replaced (or maybe not if I'm lucky), still feeling fine. Called a cab for a ride home, a torrential downpour started immediately, and they left me standing in the rain in a t-shirt and shorts for 45 minutes. Disappointed, sure, but not raging. Called and canceled very matter-of-factly and took the bus. Still not freaking out or brooding. Might not be able to make it to the volunteer orientation at the animal shelter I was planning to go to tomorrow on account of my car being broken. Oh well, I can just go to the one next week, not beat myself up over fucking that up.

This is fucking amazing. I have seriously never felt like this before in my entire life. This is better than any hypomania ever. My hypomanias, even the euphoric ones, are always a very unstable equilibrium. But now I'm not all wound up with tons of directionless energy, I'm not pissed off about things I have no control over or can't change, I'm not stupidly giddy, my mind isn't racing but also not dulled, I'm going out and doing a lot but not recklessly, I have no pressured speech or flights of ideas, I'm not physically shaking from enthusiasm. And I'm not emotionless or numb. I'm just... content. And happy - and this feels different from manic-happy - because I can take a step back and see that in the big picture, my life is going in the right direction. And yes, also feeling frustration when things go wrong, but dealing with it and moving on instead of raging with despair. Is this how ""normal"" people are able to cope with the world?

To make sure I don't swing hypomanic from here, my pdoc provisionally upped me from 150mg lithium to 300mg extended release lithium starting tonight. And we're holding a potential increase in the Lamictal in reserve if I start going depressive again. But this cocktail is bi-winning right now. That and some nice positive feedback loops I've got going with sobriety, eating well, sleeping regularly, and various other lifestyle changes.

I'm a little afraid that this is just transitory and I'll be back to hypomanic recklessness and agitation or depressive brooding soon, but right now... life is good.

What can I do?,27,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1izxqo/is_this_behavior_from_a_dr_okay_normal_what_can_i/,"I started seeing a psychiatrist about a month ago that diagnosed me with Bipolar 2. He suggested Lithium. I've gone to see him twice since then, done a lot of research, talking with my husband, and decided that I do want to try Lithium. I told my psychiatrist this, and during today's appt we were going to discuss the details and he was going to start me on it.

Last week, I saw a psychotherapist that was recommended to me, mostly for a second opinion before I made the decision to go on Lithium. This doctor was much more friendly and easy to talk to than my psychiatrist. We spent most of our time talking about my fears that lithium is going to change my personality, reduce my creativity (I'm a graphic designer) and how I'm going to miss my hypomamia to some extent. We didn't make any long term plans to keep up the treatment, but I did make a second appointment.

Most of the books &amp;amp; articles I've read recommended bipolar patients see both a psychiatrist and psychotherapist. But at today's appt with my psychiatrist, I told him about my meeting with the therapist and he got angry. He said he doesn't do ""split therapy"" and basically told me I had to choose between him and the psychotherapist.

I told him that I'm overwhelmed and not sure what route I want to take. I don't know how often the psychiatrist will want to see me once I go on Lithium. Once a month? A week? And I wasn't sure what kind of therapy I would need. I asked him if it was okay if I kept my next appointment with the psychotherapist, and then made a decision on how to move forward. He said that was fine.

But then he spent the rest of our appt being pissy about the psychotherapist and asking questions about why I went to see him, what he said, etc.

When the end of the appt came he said ""Well where do you want to go from here?""

I said, ""I'd like to start the lithium, I thought it through and I think it's the right decision, and I want to start as soon as possible.""

He said, ""Well how are you going to get lithium?""

Confused, I said, ""You recommended it to me, so I thought you were going to write me a prescription?""

He replied, ""Not as long as you're seeing the other doctor.""

I said, ""I thought you said it was okay for me to keep my appt with him?""

He said, ""Sure, you can do whatever you want but I'm not prescribing you anything until you decide what you're doing.""

I said, ""But it will be weeks before I get on the lithium then, and I'm falling apart now.""

He said, ""I didn't say you couldn't go on lithium.""

I replied, ""But the other dr is a psychotherapist and he can't prescribe meds!""

He said, ""I know. So I guess you have a decision to make.""

This went round and round until I was in tears. I told him I felt like he was blackmailing me. Withholding meds he knew I needed to force me to cancel my appointment with the psychotherapist. 

I told him if I tried to find another psychiatrist now it would be 6-8 weeks before I could get lithium. He said he understood that. But he wouldn't budge.

I told him I thought he was a blackmailing asshole, and I was done seeing him. And then I walked out.

But now I'm without a doctor. Can't get lithium. And the Wellbutrin &amp;amp; Klonopin he had been prescribing in the meantime is about to run out. It's going to take weeks to find a doctor that is taking patients, get an appointment, and get caught up so they're prescribe me lithium.

(I just typed it.)",28,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1gtke8/from_his_prison_cell_my_bipolar_son_shares_his/,"You can be anything you want to be...I am an idiot. You can go anywhere you want to go...I am trapped here.
I am an inmate. I am a good person who's done something incredibly stupid. No one was hurt, but it is really serious.

From inside my cell, with the help of my mom typing this, I will tell you my story.

I want so bad to be normal. To know what it feels like to think normally. I am blessed. I am cursed... I am bipolar.
I think it all started in grade school. I would do anything I wanted simply because I didn't know how to control myself. That little voice of reason in your head that tells you right from wrong? Yeah, I have one, but mine is manic; mine is everywhere; mine is moving a thousand miles an hour. In third grade, right before recess. That's when I had my first realization about how differently I think. I remember being so excited for recess and then at the next split second, I was incredibly sad for no reason. Today I am so relieved now to know that I'm not a freak. I'm just bipolar.

If you catch me on the wrong day I may be so depressed it's sickening. Then again, I might be so hyper and wound up that I could supply the continent of North America with energy for a year. It's exhausting.

At the moment I am incredibly manic. I can't slow down my mind. I have nothing in my life to excite me but I feel like running up a wall. Today for lunch the prison is serving peanut butter and jelly. That makes me jump for joy.

Being here now. All this could have been prevented. But my illness had hold of me.

Three years ago I was living at my mother's house. I was so up and down it scared my family. I did something that broke my mom's heart. I was so depressed at the time. I was 18 years old, was cheated on by my girlfriend and then I heard of the death of a good friend of mine. I didn't know what to do. That's when my illness spiked. I wasn't rational. I wanted to feel pain. I wanted to remove the guilt in my chest. Why was I even alive?

I planned to commit suicide.

Luckily, my family found the gun and protected me from myself. But that broke my mother's heart. To this day it hurts me to know how sick she must have felt. I wasn't safe though. I was spiraling. I was angry. Blind rage angry. And at the same time inconsolably distraught. I would be raging one minute over something miniscule then at the drop of a hat I'd be crying. It scared my mom and my brother. It scared me too.

My mom and uncle devised a plan to help me. I was given an ultimatum. I either go to a young adult mental health hospital to get help or I move out. Now I had nowhere else to go. Nowhere. But...I chose to move out.
I wish I had gotten help. I wish I had saved my future but I didn't. I remember packing my things in a manic rage and heading out the front door. I went to the only place I knew I was welcome. Somewhere that helped me destroy myself.

I knocked on the rotting door in front of me. The door opened. He opened it. I told him the situation and he invited me to stay. The house was disgusting, trash lined the floors. The smell of dogsh*t hung in the air. I made myself at home on the broken sofa downstairs.
There were no rules...at all. I am someone who has always had structure which helped me and my everchanging mental state. But here there were no rules. This let my manic self soar past the point of no return. I didn't sleep for 3 days. I remember the feeling so well. I should have been tired, exhausted, but I couldn't stop. Being tired was not an option. I partied for a few weeks like the world was ending.

Then it happened.

Like the world crashed down on me. I became so sad. So depressed. My illness helped convince myself that I had no one in my life that loved me. One extreme to the other. Think of the saddest moment in your life. Now think of the happiest. Now, go from one to the other and back. That's the way I felt. The way I still feel.
I lived house to house, couch to couch for about 8 months. Then I finally moved into my dad's house. He wanted to help me but couldn't. I was safer at his house though. I was lying to my dad about keeping a job and staying in school. I was not sane or stable enough to manage either. Now there were rules at my dad's house, but I rarely abided by them. Don't get me wrong. My father is no pushover. I was just...uncontrollable. A tornado of emotions.

I remember being talked into going to a mental hospital for an outpatient program. I did it. I completed the bullsh*t program easily and promised to take my life seriously. Now listen. The only way to help someone with their mental illness is to have them help themselves. I didn't want the help. I didn't think I needed it. So the program didn't really help me. I wasn't ready.
Fast forward another year. I'm 20 almost 21. In a manic rage fueled by idiot ""friends"" and grain alcohol I landed myself in prison with very serious charges. My only escape is writing and a 15 minute phone call to family. I'm finally taking my life...my illness...seriously. And I actually WANT help.

I want help. And I need help.

Structure. Militant structure. Wake up, eat breakfast, lock in, work out, rec time, lunchtime, lock in. Prison is extreme. Prison is unbelievable. It is my life.
Three months ago I made a choice...that drunken choice...I regret everyday. My life is the hardest it's ever been. I'm locked up with murderers, rapists, gang members. Me- Someone who would go out of his way to help just about anyone.

I hope I am out by next birthday. I turned 21 in here. Most people remember their 21st birthday as a fuzzy blur. I was locked up in a 6 x 12 cell with two full grown angry, scary men. Not scary like childish fear scary...but scary like look at them wrong and they'll stab you scary. And for someone who's led a happy, sheltered safe life, this is extreme. Twenty-one years old and I've had more excitement, ups and downs and pain than most people have in a lifetime. But don't focus on the negatives. I am alive. I am relatively sane. I am getting mental help that I need. I am sober. I am learning to be happy again.
Now, the way I see it, if I can learn to be happy now when life is the hardest, in prison, I can be happy anywhere. I know I can appreciate life 100 times more than before. The negatives may outweigh the positives at the moment but that's only temporary. Everyone has a path. Whether you believed it's predestined or you make it yourself, everyone has a path. My path has been one of extremes.

Hopefully, my next life chapter is more stable. I believe only I control that.

Appreciate the little things. The feeling of a breeze. The ability to decide what you do, what you wear, what you eat. Because someone somewhere has it worse than you do. Someone somewhere can't walk, is starving, or is locked up. Even me. I have it better than some people. I'm thankful to have a loving family, two parents, a brother...and a good lawyer (sorry, prison humor). Anyway, I appreciate the little things.

Sometimes in here, days fly by. But sometimes time just crawls. I'm someone who can handle stress, who works best under pressure. but this stress is paranoia and it's making me sick.

Take a second to step out of your life. Imagine being in one big room with men who all thrive on hurting people. It sucks. That plus never getting sleep without nightmares of being sentenced 3-15 years. This is my reality. I may not step out of prison for several years...all because of a mental illness that I never took seriously. I've always done things the hard way. This is the hardest way possible.

If you're reading this, do me a favor. Appreciate the little things you have. Smile more often. Laugh at nothing. And appreciate your freedom.",,False,,t5_2qzru,False,,,True,t3_1gtke8,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1gtke8/from_his_prison_cell_my_bipolar_son_shares_his/,

I can deal with most of the issues with being bipolar. the manic episodes I can get a grip on most of the times, I can take that third person view and try to recognize what I'm doing that irritates other people blah blah blah, crap therapists say...
But not this.
This drives me fucking CRAZY.

I have fucked/been been fucked by people whom I look back and go ""what in the fucking hell was I thinking?"" And the stupid thing is, is that I can't get enough of it. But at the same time I know deep down, that its one of the only things that really balances my mood without really affecting much else in my life.

But I was engaged a few months back and my exfiancee...oh she hated this so bad. She wasn't anywhere near as close a sexual person I am, and it eventually got really irritating for her to deal with someone as overtly sexual. But we managed, and got by, but I knew it still drove her crazy and I knew that about half the times we were having sex she was just doing it because I needed it, not because she really wanted to.

But no doubt, It was one of the reasons she saw fit to leave me. She was a lot younger than I was and wasn't ready for that much sexual contact. 

God I feel so damn bad for her sometimes, I fell like such an animal looking back at it, and I kept questioning, why the fuck can't I just close my legs and stop being such a whore?
I've lost a few of my friends because of this, I've slept with more friends than they'd want to admit because of this.
I've ended up being the kinda person that ""fucks on the first date"" ""sleeps with anyone who walks"" and that kinda stuff, no wonder I don't have a lot of friends.

This is driving me crazy, and none of the meds ever put a dampener on the hypersexuality either.

I was devastated, relieved, thankful to be alive, horrified at what I had done, embarrassed, curious, and everything in between.  I think I felt every emotion in the same 30 seconds.  

That was six days ago.  I've been released from the hospital and am spending some time at my parents house.  All of my family had learned of what happened within 24 hours of the initial event and were of course devastated.  Those several phone calls I made after getting out were the most difficult of my life.  A couple siblings, my mom (rents are divorced and remarried), and a couple friends.  I can't describe the emotion of having to do that.  I was so happy to talk to them and was so full of shame having to describe what I did.  I realize that I'm depressed; that there were mitigating factors; that I'm not in a healthy place and need help.  But still.  Call your mother and tell her you tried to end your own life.  I can promise you it will be the hardest thing you ever do, regardless of the context.  

Right now I'm safe and oddly optimistic about the future.  It's like something in my brain reset.  I realize this is brand new and I'm likely just in shock.  I've got a long, hard road ahead.  And that's why I'm writing.  I don't know what to expect.  If anyone else has survived a suicide attempt, can you please shed a little light on what I can look forward to?  Anyone out there with Bipolar II that can give some insights?

I've been prescribed Lithium and Wellbutrin.  I've read that it's an odd mix but my Doctor seemed confident and my step-mother, a psychologist, seems to think it'll be okay as well.  I understand that getting meds right is a sometimes long, difficult road, but I've accepted that.  

-Note:  I know everyone says it, but suicide is not an answer.  I'm a hypocrite for saying so.  I'd rather be alive and a hypocrite than the alternative.  The last six days have been made unbelievably hard because I have to look people in the eye that I love and explain what I did.  They're incredibly supportive and it's still awful.  I always use to fantasize about what my funeral would look like...what people would say....how sad they'd be.  Now I know.  And it's awful.  

Please.  There's nothing wrong with asking for help.

We sleep in without the anxious cloud of presumed laziness nagging from the back of my mind. She helped me write and organize a concept album about a previous hospitalization framed from the perspective of different states of mood and other patients.

We booked a show, finally committed to a tattoo I've been wanting, went to movies and read no less than three books at a time. She chain smokes and I don't hold it against her for the return of heightened taste and satisfaction it brings. 

She feeds me information at bullet train speed in organized bursts of philosophical insight. My conversations last longer and I catch myself short of interruption and annoyance.

I clued my Aunt in to all the differences between The Walking Dead television series and comic books, the literary allusions in prime time cable and why ska is a transcendental art form.

I know that hypomania will leave soon and life will return to a sense of mundane normalcy and listlessness. I meet this departure with trepidation and relief because I know we can not be united in thought and affect permanently for my own comfort and sanity.

As soon as I hung up, I sat on the floor and cried for a half an hour. Harder than I have in months.

I know it's irrational to be upset over something so small. I know I won't act normal if I hang out with him tonight. I texted him and told him to forget it, I don't want to wait around. I'm afraid my bipolar is making me act like a typical ""crazy girl"".

Stop it. 

You are a person. You are a full, whole, beautiful person who suffers from this disorder. You are **not** ""bipolar disorder.""

I won't deny that there are times, sometimes long long times, where you may feel that you are broken, crazy, worthless. 

**You are not.**

You are still here. You have slogged through shit and are still here. That says something. It means you are stronger than you think, than you give yourself credit for. 

This took my life and my career careening off into another direction, namely as a burning wreck on the side of the road. I, too, have days where I hate myself and what I think I've become. I see former classmates and friends having full and amazing careers while I'm still putting those particular puzzle pieces back together. And I hate myself and feel deep deep shame.

But you know what?

I fought for and regained my sanity and sense of self. Does it make me ""better"" than them? No. It means that I've had to do something not everyone else has. I fought for myself and *I won*. And that *is* an accomplishment to be proud of. 

I am not Bipolar Disorder. I am Me. I am a person. It took me years to come to terms with that. There is more to Me than this disorder. 

Changing how those who don't suffer view us starts with us.

Stop describing yourself ""as a bipolar."" **You are more than that.** Yes, you have it. That doesn't make you It. 

You are not ""crazy."" If you are here, on this forum, reading this or posting anything, **you are not ""crazy.""** You are seeking help. You've acknowledged you need help and you are seeking it out. That is the first step towards regaining yourself and, most importantly, it makes you not ""crazy.""

You are not your disorder.

I have constant anxiety about it and always want to take off, but financially I can't afford to do this, and I feel that the root of this issue is that I always want to run away and that I should, on some level have to deal with the consequences of my actions and be comfortable where I am, or learn to be comfortable with it because this is what I'm doing.

I already do things like go to coffee shops, go for walks, run errands, etc... and yet there is still all this empty time. My roommates sometimes ask me to do things with them, but I have just moved in and I'm not 100% comfortable with them, and I am trying hard not to drink, which I know I'll do when I'm out with new people. It's just so hard for me. I'm so agitated and anxious. I go up to to 600mg of lithium today so maybe this will take the edge off and I will stop feeling like this.

I have a pretty decent life; there's nothing to complain about really, but I feel so unmotivated! I don't really feel like doing much ever.

I don't even know why they haven't kicked me out yet), work, friends, my pet rabbits, and most importantly myself.

When I tried Risperidol for a month a couple of years ago, I felt like an absolute zombie with no feelings whatsoever. This feeling isn't the same. I just feel unmotivated and lazy with very mild depression. I don't want to be like this. When I try to change my attitude and do stuff, I may start but I'll never finish.

Every time I mention this to my pdoc, she tells me that there's no medication for motivation and that I need to deal with it in therapy. I've been going to pdocs and therapists regularly since my diagnosis, but recently stopped seeing my therapist because I just don't feel like therapy is helping. I was seeing her every week before. I'm currently scheduled to see my pdoc near the end of this month, so I haven't stopped seeing her.

*Ask about ADHD meds

*Change bad muscle-memory habits

*Get a routine with a short daily to-do list

Toward the end of the week, I got extremely agitated, way anxious about everything, was piled high with regret about everything that had ever happened in my life at once, and wanted to commit suicide just to get the hell out of my racing head.

I went to my therapist in panic, trying to get some help.  She put me on the line with the psychiatrist who gave me Ativan (he seems to have thought it was a panic attack).  Ativan did nothing to help me slow my out-of-control thoughts down, but it did make me so loopy I couldn't even recognize a dear friend who was visiting town.  Psych and therapist both told me to do a partial hospitalization program (basically 9-5 therapy), so I called the hospital; when they didn't return my call for a good three hours, my friends drove me down there in person.  The staff told me I would not be permitted to leave for my safety.

I was then committed to a psych ward for 2 days (despite no psychosis or delusional symptoms).  I was stripped of my dignity and all contact to my (awesome) friends who are my only real support through all the ups and downs of what I thought was just depression.  The doctors barely spoke to me but told me I was a danger to myself, and then tried to give me more pills because that made me angry.  My psychiatrist told me I was probably bipolar 2.

My mom flew across the country to ask them to let me out in her care, and they told us no.  I spent the worst two days of my life sitting and staring at the walls, because I wasn't really allowed to do anything.  I cracked jokes as best as I could and tried to weather it out, but the nurses and doctors didn't laugh at a single fucking thing or even give the slightest indication that they actually cared.  To top it all off, my psychiatrist fucking *forgot* to give me Prisitq while I was in the hospital, and Pristiq allegedly has the worst discontinuation syndrome of any SNRI.  I have what are apparently called ""brain zaps,"" and they're here constantly, and they're extremely uncomfortable (not quite painful, but close).

At the end of the day, I'm supposed to continue to take Pristiq, and now Seroquel, but I don't trust psychiatrists any more.  They did the worst possible thing for my mental health (cut off all social contact with the sane), stripped me of my dignity, and completely fucking failed to give me any actual help.  I'm not taking the Pristiq because I'm already in the depths of serious discontinuation syndrome and if I decide not to continue psychiatric medications I'm sure as hell not doing it twice.  I'm not going to start the Seroquel either, because honestly the possibility of metabolic syndrome among other side effects just doesn't seem worth the potential gain.  Especially if Pristiq alone may be responsible for whatever happened last week.

I trust my therapist, but I don't want to talk to the psych who was responsible for my freedom being taken away and my intelligence routinely insulted.  Is it even worth trying to find a trustworthy and competent psychiatrist?  I'm never going to let anyone put me in a psych ward again, even if it really does endanger my life.  Does anyone else have experience with withdrawal from Pristiq, and how long should I expect it to last?

**EDIT: Wow, the support is awesome, guys.  I was pretty much expecting everyone to say ""suck it up, we've seen worse,"" because it's the Internet.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  Going to take some more time to think while I move, but I will find a psychiatrist soon enough.**",,False,,t5_2qzru,True,,,True,t3_hl90l,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/hl90l/i_got_treated_like_shit_in_a_psych_ward_and_now_i/,

“It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that they are difficult.” - Segoyewatha, Seneca Chief

As the new school year approaches and the back to school sales bombard you, consider yourself a teacher. Acknowledge your duty as a teacher, because you are a teacher. A teacher for change.

While you may not have your own classroom of students to influence, your day to day actions affect others.

Your daily choices and behaviors are observed and quite possibly emulated by others. Is this a good thing? Of course it is. Just think of what you can do as a teacher.

You have an opportunity to be a model for change.

Find a way today to promote an end to the stigma of mental illness. Just do one positive thing for this important cause.

Listen to how others speak. If they are using derogatory terminology, gently suggest alternatives. Our culture remains ignorant to what the mental health community deserves. Respect. Even people like Dr. Phil, Dr. Oz, and Brian Williams have shown that society does not know enough about mental illness. You are a teacher. Teach.

Find your local NAMI office and become a member or seek out other community organizations that support mental illness. Attend a support group or participate in a 5K walk that benefits a mental health organization. Volunteer.

You are a teacher. Let's educate and change the way the world sees mental illness.

Dare to be a teacher.

Too many things going on, too much to contemplate, not enough neurons to process it all. So I'm back, yet again, to try and funnel some of the rampaging brain activity into something productive. Writing seems to help.

I can no longer remember sequences of recent events. I'm dimly aware that time is passing, but the majority of occurrences from the past have blurred into an unfocused tapestry of quiet burbling. Waking hours have faded into half-remembered dreams; and yet the dreams are more real than life itself.

My brain knows exactly what to do. This is a frighteningly familiar path, and every synapse gleefully plays its part in the symphony of self-destruction. In a recent appointment, my p-doc observed that my ""stable"" baseline is still significantly depressed. That's just the state I return to when nothing else is going on. The worst part is that even the medication can't temper the feelings of darkness; by the time doses reach an effective level, I've lost control and shot skywards like a manic rocket.

The mind is never quieted. Every thought, no matter how sincerely hopeful, is warped in on itself and destroyed. All things return to one essential truth: nothing matters, and nothing will ever improve.

Feeling anything but pain is impossible. Anhedonic states are incredibly frustrating - not so much in their inherent sense of displeasure and apathy, but in the fact that this sensation cannot be communicated to anyone who has never felt it. Apparently ""normal"" people have some mystical capacity to influence their moods positively; all I can do is reinforce my own negativity.

Despite my lingering self-awareness, that pesky consciousness locked in the corner of my mind that screams something is wrong, I feel powerless. Incapable of changing what will inevitably come next.

Sleep is necessary but dreaded. Wakefulness is the only way to stave off the dreams, and the dreams are a private hell. The most twisted soul could not devise a more custom-tailored torment; my own brain is uniquely adept at sabotaging itself. It is ruthless, vicious, and murderously efficient.

The dreams change, but the moment between dream and life never changes. In that twilight haze of unknowing, one thing always happens, and it is the thing I hate the most.

In those eternal heartbeats, I can see her there - lying beside me, at peace, content merely to be at my side. The waves of jet black hair flow gently down, down towards her naked breasts, rising and falling slowly in slumber. Lost, perhaps, in her own moments of dreaming, she sighs gently.

For a brief spell I am caught by the old enchantment, the enrapturing beauty of this incredible woman overwhelming my senses, and I think only of how deeply I love her. For that time, all is well; no pain or darkness could ever overwhelm the fortress of our passion for each other, and those walls will never crumble. None of the tortured imperfection of my mind can deter her. Nothing can stop us.

Our future is unassailable: the family, the home, the vacations abroad, all the dreams and pleasures of life packaged up neatly and represented by the promise of what is yet to come - all symbolized in the intertwining of our resting bodies. In that corporeal crystal ball I can perceive all the happiness and joy that I crave: my unborn daughter, the beach house atop a rocky cliff, snow-capped mountains in the distance, quietly humming fans in a datacenter... all the random and unkempt snippets of thought that can still bring a blip of light to my world.

And then, too soon, I try to grasp for these things - to know that they are real, to feel that warmth again in my soul, to cling to any shred of the positive that I can possibly unearth.

Everything dissolves - not quickly, but over time. The pleasant thoughts cease. The visions of things to come turn to ash. I turn my head to whisper to her that everything is OK, that we still have each other, that love cannot die.

The awful truth barges in, ravaging the happy little scene in my head, shattering the illusions and dispelling every last vestige of hope.

And even as I breathe in sharply - half from the brutal shock of it and half wishing for one last whiff of her scent to be lingering in the air - I know that I lie here alone.

Alertness returns in a surge of agony. She is a lie - a falsehood, crafted by my own obsessed and psychotic imagination, tempting the depths of my soul with deceitful promises of something I cannot and will never have. The entire purpose of her tenuous existence is to drive the knife deeper into my heart, to wrack my emotions with tantalizing impressions of what will not be.

So there I lie, clutching the empty blankets, assured to my core that my own mind is hell-bent on destroying itself.

And in those moments, before the hated sleep reclaims my awareness, I know the truth. I died long ago, and this is my hell.",,False,,t5_2qzru,False,,,True,t3_1ge2ub,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1ge2ub/i_am_my_own_worst_enemy/,

Us bipolars read and listen to music differently. It affects us differently. Listen to the right song and you instantly feel recharged and ready to face any challenge. Listen to the wrong one and you end up being depressed and wanting to die.

Even if you're not into the band I'm sharing, just take a listen. I think the lyrics and the style of hardcore interchanging with melodic choruses is the best musical interpretation of what being bipolar is like. 

The songs are even sung two different ways and played 2 different ways. Both styles showing both ends of the spectrum and what it's like living with this monster inside you.

Beauty and hope and redemption juxtaposed with anger and depression and pain.

I was getting into arguments with my partner multiple times a day- we don't really fight much normally. I started noticing it was hard to get to sleep, and waking earlier without alarms or coffee. I was excited and buzzing about everything.

My partner told me that he found my speech was difficult to follow- I was changing topics frequently and speaking really fast. I'd had the idea that my mood was elevated a bit before this, but his comment made me face what was going on.

I've had a fantastic psychiatrist for nearly 10 years now. We've worked out a regular medication regime for stable times, and a way to manage when moods start being disrupted. We have an agreement about the way to manage mood elevation (titrating one of my medications upwards, prioritising sleep, avoiding stimulation) so I don't need to consult him every time it happens, just if it isn't responding to my actions.

Over the period of the next couple days, my mood started spiralling up, really quickly like it usually does. The last time it happened like this I had a ~2 week stay in hospital within a few days of noticing, but this time I: 
* increased the medication as discussed with him
* made sure I got plenty of sleep- not sleeping, more medication
* got second opinions about spending
* avoided exciting, loud places and activities
* reduced or avoided caffeine
* stopped driving

I just started treatment a few weeks ago. Currently on 50mg Lamictal (titrating, so 1.5 weeks left at that dose) with Klonopin .5 mg as needed for sleep. My psychiatrist (who I'll see again in 1.5 weeks) is supposed to schedule an appointment with a therapist for me as well, but I haven't heard anything back from either yet about a date/time.

This time I caught it very very early, the earliest it has ever been caught. But this time he also did some things he has never done before. He took off without me and didn't tell me where he was going (He has never done this). He left all electronically devices here (He is always afraid of them when he gets sick, he believes they suck love and energy from you and give them to the Devil) He was missing for more than 12 hours (I thought he may have gone to commit suicide, he left a note that sounded... final).
Anyways, he came back and I convinced him to sign himself in (He always believes I am the Angel Michael, so I can always tell him what to do... it is actually kind of nice in a way).
This is the 2nd time in the 6 years we have been married that this has happened and he has ALWAYS gotten sick around the same exact time. (Dec 1-25). 
I miss him. I am lonely. This is nerve wracking. I mean yesterday, after 1 day of anti-psychotics, he could openly admit he was sick and he was manic (the day before everyone else was insane and he was the only one who knew the truth). 
Very few people know he is sick (His professors now, me, his family and a couple people in my family). I do not want to have them comfort me because they do not understand the guilt I feel (I have kept mania away for 5 years by really monitoring him, having a reserve of anti-psychotics for when he is sick and it has worked, but we were out and just moved so no doctor here yet). I feel like it is my fault and I feel like I could have prevented this.
I woke up this morning reaching for him, forgetting he was in the hospital and I crumbled. It was the first time I had really had more than 2 or 3 hours here or there for sleep since he started getting sick (trying to make sure he was sleeping, then when he went missing I could not rest and work up very early). 
I know he needs a network set up, but I feel like I need that too. I have been working so hard for him and sometimes I just need someone to reach out to me and be there fore me.

1349202439.0,22,self.BipolarReddit,10tuf9,I vs. II,23,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/10tuf9/i_vs_ii/,"I've been diagnosed with BPII for two years now, and have been doing a lot of reading up on BPD research lately. I just wanted to share a couple thoughts and see if anyone had similar (or contrasting!) experiences.
I've noticed a lot of people, both here and elsewhere, seem very concerned about defining differences between Bipolar I and Bipolar II and placing themselves under one heading or the other. This is understandable. I think it's crucially important for people to understand their conditions. But I'm also starting to feel like in a lot of ways the distinction is considerably more amorphous than people assume. 

One of the major things that got me thinking about this is that people with Bipolar II are not supposed to have mixed episodes, yet I've personally had multiple experiences that perfectly fit the description of a mixed episode. That said, I've never been full-blown manic, which disqualifies me from a BPI diagnosis. I'm certainly not qualified to diagnose what officially constitues a mixed episode, but this experience has definitely made me feel like while these constructs are useful as diagnostic tools, they don't necessarily encompass the breadth and complexity of Bipolar Disorder. 

The other thing I've noticed is that there is a very widely spread misconception that Bipolar II is a ""milder"" version of Bipolar I, which a lot of research seems to disprove. There seems to be relative consensus that the rates of suicidal ideation are about equal for both types, and many (not all) studies I've read have found that BPII sufferers actually have a higher suicide rate. There's also the disturbing observation that, according to one study I read, ""individuals with BPII use significantly more violent and lethal methods than do individuals with BPI."" (This quotation is from the second link at the end of this post) I think this probably has a lot to do with the fact that while hypomania is a milder form of mania, the depression that people with Bipolar II experience is equally intense and usually occurs with greater frequency, as people with BPII cycle more rapidly. There's also the fact that hypomania, despite its reputation for creating elation and productivity, is not always a positive experience--mine will often manifest as insomnia, extreme restlessness, over-sensitivity and anxiety. So defining Bipolar II or even Cyclothymia as ""Bipolar Light"" seems incredibly problematic to me. As suggested by ""Psychosocial Impairment Associated With Bipolar II Disorder"" (link number three), ""The level of impairment is more similar than it is different from that associated with bipolar I disorder. Clinicians would be mistaken to presume that...bipolar II disorder is less impairing than bipolar I disorder.""

So anyway, I guess what I'm getting at is that if you're someone who is feeling concerned about placing yourself neatly in one box or the other, maybe take a step back, take some deep breaths and just focus on dealing with whatever symptoms you're experiencing and getting to a healthier place. I'm unconvinced at this point of the objective existence of said boxes. I think it's important to remember that while these distinctions are helpful when it comes to diagnosis, at the end of the day they are relatively simple constructions imposed upon what is an incredibly complex disorder, of which science doesn't yet have a thorough understanding. 
That's my two cents, anyway. I'm no doctor, but I have been looking at creditable sources. If you're interested, here are a couple of them.

http://www.psycheducation.org/index.html is a really shoddily designed but informative website written by Jim Phelps, M.D.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20148862 is an abstract of a study that reviewed and analysed the research that has been done on suicidal ideation in people with BPI and BPII. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2147679/ is a study conducted on the psychosocial affects associated with Bipolar II

Sorry to ramble on a bit, but this distinction has been on my mind a lot lately, and I don't think I'm the only one.

I won't go into detail as to what's been going on, but my professional life has been on a serious upswing and I'm starting to feel it feed into my tendency for hypomania. This is pretty disturbing considering I've been relatively good with my meds recently, and they usually do a good job of keeping me even.

As always, the symptoms vary; gone are the days when I'd simply stay up for days on end writing elegant code or composing haunting music. They'll probably be back, and so will the days when I lay around in a mindless stupor for hours on end, unable to summon the energy even to stumble down the hall to forage for a half-assed meal.

This time around, I'm plagued by a different sort of problem... it echoes back to high school and that irritating, itchy feeling of hormonal overdose.

The title pretty much sums it up, but even still I feel compelled to elaborate, as if scrawling down snapshots of the barrage of lurid images will somehow bring some kind of peace or closure. I find myself utterly enraptured by the female form - not in a poetic, vaguely platonic sense like some artists might express, but virtually overwhelmed with eroticism and lust.

There is no satiation for the appetites in this frame of mind; no light of moderation glimmers in the stifling tunnel of endless nudity and sexuality. Female attention has become a double-edged gilded sword - priceless and coveted but almost repulsive in its enigmatic aura of lethal danger. It is safer to suffer this onslaught from within the walls of silence and imagination; to dare give voice to the thirst in real life would certainly spell immediate ruin. I have a good life - too good to sacrifice over a diseased, feverish preoccupation with flesh.

The slightest scent of sweetness becomes the mingled sweat and perfume of an imagined lover. The warmth of blankets and bedding echoes the presence of another body that does not lie there. I lie in mute torment, head resting not on the mundane pillows of a bachelor's bed, but on the breasts of a goddess who would never deign to share the wealth of her naked beauty with a wretched, debilitated monster like me.

All lines between reality and fantasy have long since blurred. The day is a haze of inattentive daydreaming; the night is punctured by waking moments, filled with confused searchings for the woman who never lay beside me.

No matter how many times the tatters of my healthy mind try to remind me, I refuse to accept that I am alone; there is some portion of my self that craves this companionship so deeply that it has forsaken even echoes of what is true. I dread the inevitable progression forwards, hating myself for this lack of restraint and control, loathing my own self-image of a leering, slavering man lost in a jungle of obsession, loving every moment and breathlessly careening forward into the abyss of unrestrained carnality.

I am alone, and always have been; even in the brightest moments I suspect that I always will be. Perhaps this is my justice; retribution for the things I have said and done. Perhaps the universe has chosen to taunt me with the one thing I cannot bring to myself to believe I will ever have. I do not lack for money, or comfort, or enjoyable pastimes; so how could I be made to suffer over a want of these things? But love is another matter, and it rings dully and horribly true that we always want most that which we cannot have.

The mere fact that words are flowing freely is a warning sign unto itself. I never write unless I am on the verge of a major episode, be it up or down. I simply can't. There is no eloquence, no expressiveness, only a parched paucity of words and a gnawing desire to communicate things which lurk beneath the surface of understanding... until it all descends into hell. The great irony of my condition is that I communicate best when I have the worst, most unspeakable things to say.

I fear now, though, that I have wandered away from any semblance of a purpose or point, and simply vomited my prose onto the digital page in vain hopes of catharsis. I must turn now to seek solace in sleep, and pray to gods I do not believe in that perhaps my dreams will not be haunted - filled with whispers from the ghost of the woman I wish I could have told these things instead.",,False,,t5_2qzru,False,,,True,t3_qxku5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/qxku5/coping_with_hypersexuality/,

I was blaming a lot of things on simply having a bad case of Seasonal Affective Disorder but there are clearly issues beyond that. 

Right now I have no money and am actually in a decent amount of debt (partially from a spending spree I went on last spring). What am I supposed to do if I can't afford a psychologist to diagnose me and refer me for medication? I have no insurance and I'm scared of dealing with this now rather than waiting until I do transition to a position within my organization that offers insurance - especially if I need medication and this becomes cited as a ""pre-existing"" condition.

I'm sorry if this isn't appropriate for this sub and I'll try somewhere else if necessary, but what am I supposed to do in the meantime? I'm not asking anyone to diagnose me, but I'm wondering if there are strategies (not necessarily ""alternative medicine"" as I see that's banned)? Are there standard questions that psychologists ask when making this determination? I understand labeling but I thought that maybe if I handed over the questions and the journals over to someone who has told me that they don't think I have bipolar that maybe I would receive a more honest answer?

I will say that right now I don't believe that I'm in serious danger, although I have trouble with certain impulses and I have trouble eating when ""manic"" although my fiance has been helpful in making sure I don't go days without eating.

To be honest, I began running out of vanity. My ten year high school reunion was coming up and I refused to look as if I'd just bore two children when I walked through that ballroom door so I started running. Walking just took too long.  Since then, ten years have passed and I'm still running.  I don't run fast and I don't run far, but I do run. There have been waves of time that I've run nearly every day, up to six miles at a time. And there have been spans of time that I only run a couple of days a week for only twenty minutes a pop. But I do run. And I don't run to fit into a little black dress anymore. I do it for me. Only sometimes it's really hard to take that first step.

I have bipolar II so mania moments are few. Instead, it is usually depression that hovers over me tempting me to just stay in bed, perhaps solve formulaic television mysteries or mindlessly crush computer candies. Some days it is a battle just to get myself to stand upright. Those are the darkest days. The days where I need running more than ever.
	
Oh, I have all the running gear. The high dollar shoes. The cute shorts and tank tops. The GPS watch with the computer program statistics. The loaded itunes with fancy non-slip earbuds. But that doesn't mean it's easy to get myself out on the trail. No, it's almost always a struggle. Just sliding my feet into my running shoes feels like a victory won. 

Once I've convinced myself that I should go for a run, and I've equipped myself accordingly, I take those first few steps. My limbs feel like lead. Even with my favorite musical back up, that first half mile is agonizing. I play little games with myself. Just get to the end of this song. Just get to the top of that hill. Just get to the end of the neighborhood. Eventually, my iron legs soften, loosen. My pace steadies and my breathing evens out. I lose myself in the music and I glide. Ok, I don't really glide but I trot and it hurts less. I keep track of my pace and my distance on my fancy watch, but on really good runs, I forget to look. Instead, I am somewhere else entirely. Worrying less and dreaming more. Fearing less and hoping more. Finding balance in my stride.

The few times I've experienced hypomania, I've found that running has helped too. One would think a hypomanic person would run faster but the opposite proved true for me. I think I was expending so much energy just being hypomanic, that when it came time to run, I was exhausted. But I didn't skip my runs. They helped calm me in fact. That rhythmic trotting for thirty minutes focused my mind and centered me if only temporarily. While I didn't get any faster during my hypomanic episodes, I definitely found running to be just as therapeutic as during my depression phases.

Running isn't easy for me. It isn't natural. It's even clunky and awkward at times. But it is vital to my well being. No matter how fast or how far I run, I know that at the end of the run, I'll feel a lot better than I did when I began. And that's why I run. Not to feel good in a new dress, but to feel good inside my own skin. That's why I run.

This movie may illustrate the real *life* of a bipolar person (one who experiences relationship problems and impulsivity), but it does not at all accurately depict bipolar symptomatology: Bradley Cooper's character struggles with his anger problem and relationships but does not spend time in depression in the movie (not shown) and the movie makes sincere (although weak) attempts at portraying his hypomania (full mania also not shown). The scene where he is staying up late at night, talking fast, and planning to read all of Nikki's books is an example). This behavior is hypomanic but still not severe enough to match his diagnosis and the hype surrounding it in the movie - he's taking 2 antipsychotics and lithium and is supposedly ""severely ill"" but doesn't have depression (not shown) and doesn't have full mania. And his hypomanic tendencies are showed only 2-3 times. The rest of the movie focuses on his anger problem, for which he needs treatment more than anything. Unfortunately, the movie does a disservice to manic-depressives because it implies that this aggressive behavior is natural or typical of most or all manic-depressives, which is NOT true. They portray a bipolar person who doesn't have actual bipolar symptoms - they illustrate him struggling with his anger problem, being provoked easily, and violently exploding at people. But these angry bouts do not co-occur with depressive or manic symptoms - they're just part of his  personality. So this movie may illustrate the *life* of a bipolar person (hence why so many people here are relating to it - but should absolutely not be generalized to all bipolar people), but it does not at all accurately depict bipolar symptomatology. It gets a 4/10 rating on that in my book. About as good as the average movie depicting mental illness.

Will try to avoid the wall of text syndrome...and not sure this is even the right place to post this...

I'm way older than most everyone on here. 53, although am told I appear much younger. Keep myself in good shape (13%BF), as it's one of my many obsessions. Was diagnosed BPII 17 years ago. Am a professional with decent people skills (when I'm 'on'), own a home here in So CA, two dogs and have what most people would consider a nice life (from outside appearances). The problem is, I am almost completely isolated. The friends I had, one by one have tired of my inability to just 'bounce up' and do things with them. I don't blame them.  I work from my home, when not at a client's site, so I can remain inside for days at a time. As a gay man, living in a suburb made up of conservative family types, I'm not in an environment where it's easy to make neighborly friends.  Live here due to work...not really my preference.  
So here's my issue. I'm falling further into being totally isolated. I go to the grocery, walk the dogs, work and sleep. If it wasn't for the ability to go online and at least participate virtually with people, I'd be even more screwed. I just had to see my psych to add another AD and go back on the anxiety meds...as I was heading down into a bad place. 

I failed at avoiding the wall of text...sorry!  I just want to know how others, if there are any, have managed to avoid becoming isolated due to the debbie-downer syndrome and loss of friends.

I feel like I am helping people out, that I am accepted, that I have something to offer, that I can contribute to the common good, that as a kind member told me recently, I am a ""genuine person.""

In real life, I feel the same way around my friends. They get to see what I am really like. The good and the bad. But out beyond them, in public, I am frightened. Interactions with strangers or people I don't know well often frighten me. I don't know how to get beyond small talk and form real relationships with people I don't meet through a friend. I don't even really do any activities that let me meet lots of people.Attention makes me uncomfortable; I want the conversation to proceed in a predictable manner and I want to feel a sense of control throughout because a lot of the time I feel like I can't think of replies on the spot.

I thought it was all just my social anxiety getting worse and worse. I knew I had trust issues and a paralyzing fear of rejection that I feel is completely warranted after all of the fuckups and failures I have been through. But I realized it is more than that. I am afraid to be myself. Maybe that's part of the fear of rejection and my self esteem is really that shot. I would rather just not open up at all than take any sort of risk even if it means no possible reward of connecting with others. Just hide behind witty comments and irony and hope that random improbable conversations will come up where I can showcase my intelligence. Hope that if I dress well people will just come up to me even though I feel unattractive.

It just hit me today that this is why I am avoidant of social situations. I feel worthless, stupid, awkward, and out of place a lot of the time. I know I have no logical reason to but I can't shake it. Self-loathing is becoming a problem for me. And instead of trying to stop myself and break that track in the back of my head it almost feels good, it feels right, deserved. I want a relationship in the near future and intimacy and emotional connection but I feel unlovable and emotionally immature; I'm too much of a codependent mess anyways and I don't see myself working up the courage again to even try.

I feel like such a failure. I relapsed hard. I think I am starting to get addicted to meth again. And now I am lying to all my friends about it. Afraid and ashamed of being myself.

I just wanted throw out a summary of this really weird experience I had over the last few weeks.

For whatever reason, the brownie threw me into a ridiculous fit of mania, complete with psychosis and same basic symptoms as the only other episode I've had. I had not gone off my lithium, and levels were normal when checked in the lab, so I can only imagine it was the pot that triggered the episode. 

I have no idea if this is something anyone else has experienced and am not here to start controversy about marijuana use. Rather, I just wanted to relate my experience in case anyone has questions or misgivings about marijuana use and bipolar. FYI I was taking only lithium at the time.

This is true for lots of people, even with ""perfect"" health and without a mental condition like bipolar.  Add manic depression into that mix and it becomes probably even more so.  Partly because, at least in my own experiences, people with different mental health problems may have bigger or more intensive dreams and goals for themselves.  They may be unrealistic, but they can still be beautiful even if they aren't realized.  

Having to compromise your dreams so you can live a feasible life is maybe for the better in some ways, but still a tragedy I think.  Goals are important though and sometimes we create and do amazing things as people who are different in a way than the majority of the population.

It can be really hard though to have these grandiose, majestic visions and plans and to not even come close to them in reality.  Good exercise in imagination though and I would rather have dreams and not reach them to not have dreams.  I think as manic depressives maybe sometimes we admire mediocracy or stability but in the end that is something that terrifies me and wouldn't really want. I crave that emotion. Certainly indifference scares the piss out of me. I can be a fuck up sometimes but hopefully I can be a great person at times too.  To flat line is to be dead, got to feel.  But you also need balance and structure too.  

Some of the dreams I have had that probably won't come true, is to become a professional footballer in Europe(I am American and 22 now, never going to happen). Still love football and can play it anytime for fun so though it's sad, c'est la vie.  Travel to Portugal or Marseille, France, go to the Mediterranean and learn to sail.  Learn another language.  Start a band and play, harmonica or guitar or drums.  Learn to play Clair de Lune, Hungarian Rhapsody no 2 and C.R.E.A.M. on the piano.  Go to a music festival or rave.  Fly with a wingsuit. Get some poetry published, write a novel.  And I won't even get into the fantasies about girls, most of which haven't panned out so far :)

So most of those I can still do I guess, but time is a crazy thing really sneaks by.  If I fuck up most of those, my biggest and greatest dream is to be a good father.  That I will not compromise or fuck up.  

Here is something my psychologist(who I haven't talked to in 3 or is it 6 months? I have been doing well by myself I believe, still the guy is a class act) once told me.  ""I am Warrior and King of my own Being"" Loved that one and will write it down a lot in my notebooks and around town in chalk and what not.  Basically means that you can't just be a king or ""dreamer"" and not work at it, or get in the trenches.  You will not get anywhere, ideas only carry you so far, has to have action and will.  But if you are just a warrior and have no direction or desire to go anywhere you will just destroy yourself.  Really cool that one

Will leave you with a Sylvia Plath quote ""What I fear most, I think, is the death of the imagination...the poverty of life without dreams is too horrible to imagine."" 

We are blessed with a curse :) But we do have that power to dream and do quite amazing things and fill other peoples world's with light.  Remember that when you are in a really dark place, peace everyone.

We are now trying to get him home. 



Yesterday we talked to him on the phone and he seemed fine. A few minutes ago, he called and said he had no idea where he was. He was on a stranger's phone. He didn't make a lot of sense. 

After getting him to give to the phone to others, we found out that he was at a gas station near Garberville, CA which is five hours away from where he lives. He had no idea how he got there. It sounded as if he'd given his car away because he planned to commit suicide, but also that he thought the people who took his car would come back. No one in the gas station has been willing to drive him to the hospital nearby, although we did get them to call EMS for him. 

We've never faced anything like this before and we aren't sure what to do. If he goes to the hospital without any ID, will we be able get in contact with him there? He's scared to end up in another mental hospital, because he had a really bad time in the last one, so we're worried that he might not go with the EMS. The nearest family member lives 11 hours away, or else we'd be driving to find him.

My dad is on the phone with the local police reporting his car stolen, although my brother didn't remember his license plate, and none of us know what it is. If anyone has any advice or has been through anything like this before, please help. 

Thank you.

Edit: The police arrived and since he doesn't seem to be a danger to himself or others, there's nothing they can do, even though he has no car, no phone, no ID. We got in contact with a friend of his from Berkeley who is going to try to drive up, but she won't be there for another four hours and we're worried he's going to wander off. 

Edit 2: He's missing. We sent his photo to the police. The friend who drive 4 hours to find him arrived shortly after he left. We're extremely frustrated and worried.

I hate that I can't just have one mood.  I hate that I can't be happy for long periods of time.  I hate that I have pushed every single person away from myself because I know they can't handle it/understand it.

I went to law school and quit... and now im getting married.",24,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/ixjge/im_tired_im_28_and_ive_been_raped/,"I'm tired.  I'm just so tired. I've been drinking.  This is the only way I can do it.

My dad left me when I was two.  He left me with a bipolar mother.  She was on her 2nd marriage at the time... one out of the four that would devastate her.  When he left, we lived in my aunts garage.  We stayed there for three years.  Thereafter, my aunts and my mom pooled there money together to start a care home business that took of the elderly.  We moved into a nice suburb and I went to preschool.

The care home was across the street from us and after school I would go there.  Over about a year I was raped by the caregivers, male and female.  The female would sit me down and have her watch porn while I sat there undressed.  The male would take me into a backroom where I would wrestle.  I remember him asking me to turn up the volume on the stereo.  I remember the cold on my skin.

My mother got married when i entered the first grade. He was a violent man. A lawyer.  I grew up with five women, you see.  And I was effeminate... he told me so.  He used to just beat the shit out of me.  He wanted me to be the sporty type, but I was scared of baseballs.  So he would tie me to a fence, but he'd give me the courtesy of a free arm.  I would catch it or get nailed. 

My new stepfather threw me against a car when I was in 4th grade and broke my nose.  I remember my mother apologizing for me.  I had acted up, apparently.  

He started cheating on my mother when I was in 6th grade maybe... right after he lost a city council election no less.  He beat my mom good.  

I'm 28 now... I looked through her box of pictures... a mess of material from the past all thrown in... and there were pictures of her bruised and puffed up face.  I got used to the cops coming to the house.  I got used to hiding in the closet.  

They divorced when I was in 7th grade... At this time, my mom had met a man and she decided to move us to the other side of the country, to a place where it snowed. I had never told her about the rape... and she refused to talk about the beatings.  

During 8th grade, for a reason neither I nor my mother remembers, I threw my tv down the stairs, broke a lot of glass, and threatened my new stepfather.  The cops were called and calmed me down.  But after they left I broke everything in the house.  They came back and they strapped me down to an ambulance and took me off to the ""basement.""  I was institutionalized twice in the next year.  Bipolar.  Type I.  

My mom couldnt handle me and so she decided to ship me off to a different country to be with my father at 15.  He tried to be a dad, but I think I was too far gone.  I developed a bad meth habit and went off on my own.  I fell in love though.  

I met a girl and got her pregnant.  Abortion was illegal in this country so we had to go to a back alley doctor.  I was so fucked up that I forgot the date of the appointment and so she went alone.  We thought everything had went well.

Four months later, she called me.  She was sitting on her toilet and crying.  She was going through labor.  Right then and there.  I went over as soon as I could.  On the toilet, just me and her, she gave birth to a still born baby.  I called our doctor and he told me to cut and tie the cord.  The baby?  I remember exactly how he looked...  Her mom took the baby.  I never saw HIM again.  After all that, as I was lying next to her as she was resting, I fucking fell asleep.  Can you believe that shit?

I spoke to her years after.  She told me she was hospitalized for PTSD.  She had tried to kill herself.  She relives that moment over and over... and every time I fail over and over again.  

Later that year I was arrested for grand theft auto and possession.  It worked out for me, though.  It became a ""misunderstanding.""  I was in a third world country... with a dad that had influence.  I just had to go back to rehab and get back on the pills.  

I went back to the states when I was 19.  I got my first job at a theme park and I went back to school.  I isolated myself.  I started even sleeping in the bath tub.  Because of something... i started burning myself.  Hate.  Regret.  Desperation.  I dont know. 

I had a bad relationship.

After all that I went to community college.  I took psychology, philosophy, photography, english, and histroy.  I stayed there for 3.5 years.  I read and I studied and I tried to bury everything from the past.  And I did that well.  

Right before I went to a UC, I met a girl who was about to go to law school.  I fell in love with her immediately. We made plans to marry, to grow and work together.  She taught me everything I know about the ""real"" world.  I applied to law school at the end of my time there...  and got in.  Burial successful.  

But at law school I just fucking crashed.  I convinced my psych teacher that I was adhd...  He filled me with a bunch of adderall... you know what happens next... I just couldnt handle the pressure anymore.  I felt like I had been racing to be something I wasnt.  

I left after a year... with 40k in debt.  I moved down south to be with my girlfriend.  I love her dearly.  I'm taking all these psych classes in hope of going to grad school in psychology.  We're getting married soon.... We just had our first pre-marital counseling session...

But im so tire fellas... im tired.  Im crying right now.  I don't know if I can go on...  Every day I pretend that my life has been the same as everyone elses... i smile and wave and shake hands... im charming... 

My pre-marital counselor referred to me as disabled last night... I try to give my fiance so much... but sometimes i just cant sleep... and sometimes i just feel down... I try to compensate... but sometimes its not enough...  Im just tired guys... and i feel like burning myself....

However, the pattern in my adult life seems to be that I start to succeed in the conventional sense, and then, without fail, the disease comes back up and smacks me down. I've almost flunked out of college twice, I've had to walk away from a few really good jobs, and my nerves have kept me from seriously dating anybody. I would love to travel, date, and take more chances in life, but I'm afraid that if I don't stick to a strict lifestyle, then I'll spiral out again. 

More importantly, my self-confidence has taken so many blows that I'm afraid that all I do will come to naught. Whenever I try, I fail for reasons beyond my control, so why even try? I know that I'm intelligent and attractive, and people seem to be drawn to me as a leader for reasons I don't entirely understand. I've been told that I have lots of potential, but all it seems impossible to realize.

I had my medication readjusted last year, and I've felt better than ever before. (It sucks that I spent 10 years being un or under medicated, but so it goes). I haven't had any major incidents within this year, but I haven't really tried for anything beyond school and surviving. I used to want to be a doctor, now all I think I deserve is some job that lets me do something dull and pays me enough so that I can live. So how do I motivate or forgive myself after all that's happened?

 I've just never had the chance to talk about these things to anybody who has the disorder, and this is my first post to BipolarReddit, so please excuse the length of this post. Finding a community like this has me so excited, I'm glad that I'm not alone. 

**TL;DR**: How can I get myself to try in life when, based on past experiences, all I ever do is fail? How do you guys live with the specter over your head all the time?

Now that I am slowly approaching 5 years of staying out of mental hospitals, 5 years of being in remission from bipolar type I, and going on 3 years of moving on from my past drug abuse issues, I have finally managed to help myself.

I contacted my old case manager from an outpatient day program/partial hospitalization program that I attended after my last hospitalization in 2008. I am doing so well, and my old case manager feels the same way, that I have been invited back to be a guest speaker. I now have the chance to share my own story and to show the people who are now in that program, the people who are still recovering from recent hospitalizations, the people who are in need of help and direction, how I managed to drastically improve the overall quality of my life. I get to show them how I did it and prove to them that it is possible to get a handle on their lives and take control if they seek proper treatment.

I never thought that a chance like this would be presented to me and it feels very good. I am working on getting set up to work in the mental health field so this will be ""practice"" of a sort. I want to give these people hope for recovery and provide them with the knowledge they need in order to start heading in the right direction.

I have been wanting to do something like this for the last few years, but kept holding off because I really wanted to go back there and say that I have been managing my situation quite well for many years. I wanted to be sure that this was a long-term thing for me and that I hadn't suffered from any fuck-ups.

I just wanted to share with everyone. I am so happy that I have this opportunity and I very much hope that something I say to the patients in the day program will sink in so that they can benefit from me sharing my story with them.

I'm on lamictal so it hasn't been *that* bad, but I've already missed three days of school (going 2 days a week). 

Last night it happened again. I hit a hard snag and couldn't complete my paper and just spiraled into darkness.

For the first time, I explained to her how I sometimes just want to get malicious; I hit a snag in an assignment and I want to write nasty things to the professor as responses. I'll want to send all of them a nasty e-mail to make sure that I don't ever go back. That I want to insult their professions and spit on their work. How this is sometimes how I want to respond to things; I get very destructive, malicious and sadistic. How sometimes it feels like I am addicted to the guilt associated with it.

I also explained how the circular reasoning collapses under itself into a bottomless pit. I get upset with myself which makes me feel bad, which makes me upset at myself because I have no reason to feel bad which makes me feel worse, and then the negatives really start to creep in: ""You don't deserve a diploma."" ""You're not capable of maintaining a career."" ""You're just wasting your time, your parents/the state's money, and everyone's hopes for you. You're just going to disappoint them, just quit now before they're expectations grow."" And on and on. 

I explained that it makes me hate myself for how I can get. It makes me question our relationship because, ""how much of this can someone actually handle?"" That in regards to her handling my fits. That made her cry. 

But I was telling her things that I've never actually told anyone about before. The impulses and degradation that I've always kept to myself. The part of me that I've never let escape except that one time; I sent this girl whom I had a disagreement an e-mail that was worthy of prosecution... I was so cruel and used the worst language I could come up with, insulting her on a very personal level. I haven't done that again, but the impulse is there sometimes. 

It made me feel better. Not good, but better. Actually getting that off my chest; to someone I believe truly loves me and cares about me and wants to understand me better.

With the NRA's Crazy Wayne calling for a comprehensive and active database of the mentally ill to be used for background checks when purchasing guns (beyond the [federal](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics) and [state](http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/justice/possession-of-a-firearm-by-the-mentally-ill.aspx) databases we have now. . .), we have to watch our backs.  I NEVER thought I'd get to say this: they're trying to take our guns!  But screw the guns: they're trying to take our rights.

It’s one of those vaguely annoying ideas you hear floating around, maybe in pseudo-news chatter, casually mentioned in conversation, or the subject of a barely-funny late show monologue: create a federal database of every American diagnosed with a mental illness in order to run background checks for gun purchases.  You know, just a way to stigmatize people who have done nothing wrong except seek help, intrude upon their privacy , and jeapordize their confidential health information without cause.

Our society has long held an [unsupported notion](http://www.samhsa.gov/mentalhealth/understanding_Mentalllness_Factsheet.aspx) that mental illness causes violent behavior, with emphasis on schizophrenia and bipolar being the most dangerous.  As a bipolar, I would ddeeeeefinitely get databased and blacklisted, even though I have never been violent.  Though I have no desire to own a gun, I am absofuckinglutely livid that some Americans want to intrude upon my privacy, put my confidential info in a national database so the government can surreptitiously keep tabs on me, and put the confidentiality of my health info at risk.

I cannot tell my parents about my problems because they will worry sick about me, I cannot tell my friends about my problems because of the stigma surrounding Bipolarity so I am stuck having to internalize everything and it is miserable.

My question is: how do you handle being bipolar and having fulfilling relationships/friendships? For me, I have always had plenty of friends but very few close friends. Anytime someone gets close, I freak out and quickly distance myself. I have this fear that if they find out about the true me (terrible bouts of depression, uncontrollable temper without any warning, etc.) that they'll quickly run away so what I do is keep up this carefree expression like I don't have a problem in the world while I secretly suffer. Due to this, I ""know"" a bunch of people but feel that no one really *knows* me and this makes me feel extremely alone. 

With regards to relationships, I have never been able to keep one longer than three months. Once someone starts to show true affection towards me, I do everything in the book to push them away. I convince myself that ""they're not good enough for me"", or that ""they're too clingy"", I have even gone as far as cheating on a few of them (in college, during my manic episodes, I would occasionally go through hyper-sexual bouts). The majority of these girls have been so sweet and kind to me and I just turn around and treat them terribly. I don't know how to make it stop. I thought that as I grew older I would be able to settle down and find someone but this cycle keeps repeating itself. I am sick of hurting people due to my problems.

If anyone can give any advice on any of this, I would greatly appreciate it. I want to stop this, I want to make a change, I want to have fulfilling relationships but I don't know how.

**Edit:** I would like to sincerely thank everyone for their responses. Just knowing that there are others out there like me means the world to me :). For those who asked, I am currently on meds and am trying to convince myself to go into talk therapy; it is just difficult but I have trouble trusting people.

I'm not suicidal at the moment - though thoughts of ending my life never really stop, even at the best of times - but I feel like I have some things to say.

Ordinarily I wouldn't share these kinds of things with anyone; the stigma and ignorance that surround mental disorders is staggering, and even amongst the most well-intentioned people I've found very little in the way of genuine support. But there's something oddly compelling about the idea of other people knowing these things. Maybe it's as if somehow I am forcing myself to stop existing in a state of perpetual denial about what my life is like and how much this disorder impacts every moment of my existence.

I went to a local support group earlier this afternoon. It was an overwhelmingly positive experience; there's nothing quite as reassuring as starting to describe your torment and having someone else jump in and finish your thoughts for you - knowing that other people walk through the same chasms of hell. But even in that context, around complete strangers, with the benefit of near anonymity and deep mutual understanding, I felt like just a projection of my self; as if I was playing a role, watching myself do and say things that seem real but are just shadows of the truth.

I've been through enough psychotic episodes to recognize the sensations around depersonalization and dissociation. It's not dissimilar to what I feel now, although my current state is markedly less intense. It seems to me that it takes a concentrated effort to recall any kind of reality about myself anymore, like I've purposefully distanced myself from who I am in order to survive.

Part of all this is chronic isolation. I live alone, in a small apartment, with no furniture and only a handful of possessions. Most of those are still in boxes from when I moved in, stacked in the dining area. I go to work, pretend to be normal and OK, and then come home and go to sleep. There are no gaps, no openings into which reality might creep unexpectedly. I live in a bubble of my own making during the day, and then disappear into unconsciousness when I get home, racing to escape the prospect of having to contemplate my life.

There are social occasions in there, to be sure; hanging out with people from work, hitting up a bar, grabbing dinner, getting together to play some music, whatever else. Superficially, it seems fine; well-adjusted, normal, call it what you like. But nobody in this area aside from my doctors even knows I'm bipolar. I have fabricated a lie about myself so intricate that it conceals all evidence of dysfunction - often even from myself.

Most of the time, aided by heavy-handed pharmaceutical intervention and an unhealthy obsession with nicotine, I manage to survive like this. As long as I can't spend too much time awake and alone, I don't think about it at all. But at times like this, especially after openly talking about my situation for the first time in my life (outside of some posts here), it's impossible to escape.

There are so many aspects of my life that contribute to this isolation and alienation... too many to list, too many to believe. It feels like every scrap of my past just adds up into a conglomeration that nobody could ever really find to be anything besides repulsive; or, at best, unfathomably foreign. And as time goes on, it seems that I do nothing but reinforce this situation with every choice I make.

What I find so frustrating about this is that it is utterly opposite of what I actually want. There are nights, as my tenuous grasp on the universe wavers and the unreal flits down the hall, when I can no longer remember that I am actually alone. The empty pillow beside me is warm from a head that never rested there, dusted lightly with the scent of hair that never tumbled across it. The blankets huddle against the hips and breasts of the woman that doesn't lie beneath them, and in the air is the faint breathing of a soul I have never met.

In these moments of confusion, between the light of day and the emptiness of being lost in madness, there is a kind of peace; that which is not - but which _could be_ - brings me the truest kind of contentment and satisfaction. There is freedom, to know, even though it is false, that someone shares my life so completely that she would stay with me through the darkest and weirdest places I have to tread.

Biology, psychology, chemistry, evolutionary conditioning - I don't know where this comes from, why it holds such sway over the deeper recesses of my mind, but there it remains. On the one hand, I don't feel incomplete; I hold no delusion that I lack a ""perfect person"" to come into my world and make everything better. Quite the contrary, I'm more or less happy with my state of affairs, with few exceptions; I'm well taken care of in all the material ways that matter, and largely enjoy my life.

So long as I can banish the specter of _her_, I am fine.

I've heard all the answers before; everything from ""there's no perfect person"" to ""you'll find the perfect person someday"" to ""meh."" None of them ring true; all of them are easy to dismiss and easy to argue with. It's as if part of my brain wants this fantasy to become real so desperately that it refuses to listen to reason, and another part is so strongly convinced it can never happen that it, too, will heed no logic.

I feel like no solution can be acceptable, that I will fight to sabotage every best opportunity I could possibly have, that if the unthinkable transpires and I find myself confronted with the thing I dream of most, I will simply walk away in disbelief.

She's the first counselor I've met in a long time who actually acts like a real person, not a soft spoken pretend-doctor.  I feel like I can be honest with her and not feel uncomfortable about it.  She seems like she's going to be great at challenging me and pushing me forward as opposed to coddling me and letting me wallow in self pity.  

However, in the very first session, religion came up.  She asked where I met my fiance, and I told her at church, but then added that I'm an atheist now.  She immediately responded with, ""You're not an atheist, because they don't believe in *anything*.  You're agnostic at best.""  

That's when I pretty much completely withdrew and stopped saying anything.  All the things I wanted to say - like that I do believe in things, such as science, and that I *don't* feel like I ""don't know"", which is what agnosticism would imply, and that leaving christianity was one of the best things that ever happened to me - I couldn't say any of it.  She sensed that I was uncomfortable, and basically just went on to say, ""God saved my life when I was recovering from my mental illness.  I'm going to try to get you back on the God side.""  

Like I said before:  I really like this therapist.  I honestly want to stay with her if at all possible.  But if she attempts to shove religion down my throat, I'm most likely going to end up faking it to make her happy and then finally leaving once I'm miserable enough.

It could mean all the difference if you become severely ill and symptomatic and cannot advocate for yourself. (More information in expanded text including links to resources).,21,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/mvown/you_should_know_what_a_mental_health_advance/,"From the [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_directive):

&gt;An advance health care directive, also known as living will, personal directive, advance directive, or advance decision, are instructions given by individuals specifying what actions should be taken for their health in the event that they are no longer able to make decisions due to illness or incapacity, and appoints a person to make such decisions on their behalf. A living will is one form of advance directive, leaving instructions for treatment. Another form authorizes a specific type of power of attorney or health care proxy, where someone is appointed by the individual to make decisions on their behalf when they are incapacitated. People may also have a combination of both. It is often encouraged that people complete both documents to provide the most comprehensive guidance regarding their care.

The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) has a Mental Health Advance Directive template on their site as a PDF file. You can download this PDF file, print it out, and discuss completing it with your psychiatrist and/or therapist.

Here is the link to NAMI's template (Warning: PDF file!): [http://www.namigainesville.org/images/Psychiatric%20Advanced%20Directive.pdf](http://www.namigainesville.org/images/Psychiatric%20Advanced%20Directive.pdf)

Here is another link to the National Resource Center on Psychiatric Advance Directives: [http://www.nrc-pad.org](http://www.nrc-pad.org/). This website provides further resources and educational information concerning creating your own Advance Directive.

I recommend using NAMI's template to work from. Depending on what resources may be available at your outpatient clinic/therapist/psychiatrist's office they may be able to provide you with their own version of a template for an Advance Directive (I know that in New Jersey, USA UMDNJ UBHC has its own template that you can request).

To get into it a bit further, let's say that I go manic. I am delusional. I cannot advocate for myself. I do not realize how sick I am. I feel perfectly amazing because, after all, I **AM** the Messiah come to save the Earth. Something happens and an ambulance and police are called to deal with me because I am acting quite inappropriately in public and have become rather disruptive.

If I have filled out and filed an Advance Directive, I can be sure that I won't go to RWJUH in New Brunswick, NJ because I fucking hate that place. Because I specifically mentioned which hospitals I will and will not allow myself to be treated at I will end up going to someplace that actually knows WTF they are doing and that can give me quality care for my crisis.

I can also specify which medications I have been on before and whether or not they have had any success. I can specify that I am not to be placed on certain medications for various reasons. I can give my mother power of attorney over me because I trust her to make sound decisions regarding my mental health care.

I think you get the picture.

I started dating this girl about a month ago. I am 22, she is 21, and we are both students, living separately and seeing each other about twice a week. and I am **so** into her. she's absolutely wonderful.

I had known all along that she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I do not know which type, but she seems a type I, with psychotic episodes included as part of her mania. she was diagnosed after a psychotic break last summer (something I've also known all along) and is now again in the hospital following another psychotic break that occurred on tuesday night.

all the while I had been seeing her, everything has been... dare I say, perfect? she didn't seem manically ""up"" or irrationally energetic or anything like that, just like she was at a healthy balance. so I didn't want to mess with that, though I know how important medication is to those who have this condition. we were happy and everything was going fine.

she has a roommate (of 3 years) who is just fucking awesome with keeping an eye out for her, parents who love her and are very supportive, a therapist that she trusts and loves to talk to (and about), and then there's me.

I like to think that I'm ready to take on whatever may come my way, to give her the appropriate amount of support, care, and love, and ultimately to cultivate this relationship through these tough times in such a way that would allow for it to continue to grow. but this is still a little scary. though I'm confident and hopeful.

I care about this girl very much and would love nothing more than to see her happy, though I am more than ready to employ my powers of patience and staying at arm's length.

so, is there any advice that you would give, speaking from personal experiences, or anecdotal knowledge, as to how I should approach this?

1374861628.0,22,self.BipolarReddit,1j3zom,Anyone ever wish for hypomania? CONFESSION: I think of it like a catalog sweater that doesn't quite fit.,27,5,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1j3zom/anyone_ever_wish_for_hypomania_confession_i_think/,"For me, hypomania feels like receiving a beautifully gift-wrapped present. I unwrap it with frenzied anticipation, knowing the gift comes with an expiration date. Just what I've hoped for, just what I've wanted, but it may not be exactly what I need, like a sweater ordered from a catalog that doesn't fit quite right. We love the looks and how it feels, but it just doesn't match the rest of our emotional wardrobe. The gift of hypomania, enjoyed while it lasts, ultimately must be returned.

For me, the gift of hypomania feels like electricity fluttering through me, like an endless tickle with a feather just below the surface of my skin. When hypomanic, I have no desire for sleep or food. My eyes are opened wider and my senses feel heightened. Remarkably jovial and talkative, talkative to the point of interrupting sometimes, I feel like I need to comment on everything. Those closest to me say they like me hypomanic, but they are more than ready for me to calm down. Hypomania creates a caricature of myself. Invincible. Bigger than life.

One benefit of hypomania for me is productivity. Once my boundless energy is bridled, I can tackle just about any project. At work, my desk is organized, papers are filed, and exciting new lessons are developed. I never slow down and neither do my students. For middle schoolers, a hypomanic teacher is quite a treat. I talk a mile a minute, cracking jokes and pacing about the room, and we bounce from one activity to the next. Not many papers get graded, and tangential thoughts may invade my lessons, but ultimately, my hypomania, in small doses, benefits my students. 

At home, my productivity may take the form of organizing every closet in the house, or cleaning out all of the kitchen cabinets. My family finds this helpful yet annoying, since I see no reason why everyone can't unload all of their clothes from their dressers and get organized too. My hypomania once even inspired me to paint my office. Now that was a mistake. Not only did I choose a yellow the shade of an egg yolk, I painted with such unfocused energy and lack of precision that once completed, it looked as though the sun crashed into the corner of my house and splattered all over my office walls. Needless to say, I had to hire my ex-husband to come and repaint it. Talk about humiliating.

Another symptom of my hypomania for me is this incredible urge to create something and follow it through to completion to the exclusion of anything else. For example, I may sit at the piano for hours composing a song, and until I am satisfied that it's finished, I will not get up unless I am forced to by the demands of family or work. Even then, while begrudgingly meeting my commitments, I feel a magnetic force pulling me back to the piano. It takes all my strength to fight it. Confession: there have been days where I have gone to work and instead of going straight to my classroom to prepare for the day, I've snuck into the music room and spent my half hour prep time playing the piano before the music teacher arrives. Being creative becomes my primary focus. Then, on those same music mania days, I will return to the music room during my free period and see if the piano is available. Again, I'll play until I have to return to my own class.

For me, being hypomanic has its benefits but it certainly has its downsides too. The biggest negative hypomania brings is the dread of its inevitable end. I know it won't last forever, but I want it to. I want to feel that electric energy and invincibility just one day more. The dark days of depression glares me in the face too often. I don't want to look at them again. I am willing to risk just about anything to keep that hypomanic euphoria, even if my symptoms lead me to do dangerous or careless things like shop too much or drive distracted or worse. I crave that sense of elation so much I am willing to risk it. Nothing bad will happen to me, right? I am invincible!

But eventually, I know the gift of hypomania must be put back into the box and returned and our days must turn back to the darkness that is depression. I'll wait patiently for the next gift-wrapped package of hypomania, while flipping through the catalog and dreaming of that perfect sweater.",,False,,t5_2qzru,False,,,True,t3_1j3zom,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1j3zom/anyone_ever_wish_for_hypomania_confession_i_think/,

I've discussed it with my doctor and he outlined the risks. We also talked about the impact on me and the stoppages and changes in medication that I would need to make. He also said I wouldn't be able to breastfeed for as long as I'd like due to the need to get back on meds (apparently, post  partum depression is common for us females).

We've discussed the generic component of bipolar disorder, especially since we believe my mother has undiagnosed bipolar disorder. We are worried about the chance that I will pass this on to our children.

1370103490.0,18,self.BipolarReddit,1fgw7d,Any thoughts on coping with post-manic regret? Any fellow cyclothymia patients on here?,20,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1fgw7d/any_thoughts_on_coping_with_postmanic_regret_any/,"I don't know if this is even the clinical term for what I'm feeling, but it's the best way I can articulate it. I'm cyclothymic, which you probably know is characterized by rapidly-changing short term cycles, rather than the weeks and months of mania or depression many of you deal with. I suppose that ultimately this is a milder form of bipolar disorder, but it gets exhausting and brings with it a fair amount of shame. Often at the end of an episode (not strictly hypomanic, but something close to it) that lasts just a few hours or a couple of days, I'll become extremely aware of how I presented myself to other people, especially new acquaintances, and the long hard look in the mirror on Sunday morning is often brutal.

I guess I should preface this by saying it's been an extremely difficult and tumultuous year. Beginning May 2012 and continuing into this past winter, I've ended the most serious relationship of my life, experienced a couple of deaths in the family, said goodbye to many of my best friends (we all graduated college and were flung either back home or all over the country) and generally lost my sense of self. Landing a high-stress, low paying job in my field means I always have a lot on my plate at work, and until a few weeks ago I was back in my parents' house to save up to move. The depression is waning slowly but surely, and I think I've made some progress, though that loss of ""self"" is taking a little longer to dissipate than I'd like. However, there is one bigger enduring problem.

Before I go further I think it's also worth mentioning that I'm what many people would call ""intense."" This is something I've never particularly liked about myself, but it's a trait that makes me loyal, engaging and compassionate in the eyes of some people, and a trait that makes me arrogant and obnoxious for others. Again, this embarrasses me, but as far as I can tell it is genuinely part of my personality, and not part of my disorder.

A silly incident at a party recently (made a minor ass of myself in front of a couple of people after I'd gotten a few drinks in me; could've happened to anybody, mood disorders notwithstanding) made me realize not long after that I had been riding a high for a day or two. And that thought, rather than the morning-after twinge of a normal 22-year-old, is what bothers me the most. The low is always accompanied by a sense of crushing shame, and I am having trouble deciding whether or not I do indeed deserve to be ashamed. Aren't I still the person that said that annoying or over-the-top thing? Aren't I the guy that really just shouldn't have done ""that,"" gone ""there?""

I've been on Lamictal since I was 17 (approaching 23 now). My psychiatrist and physician have both said that my disorder seems to be mild enough that a very basic stabilizer like Lamictal should help me keep it together.

Does anyone have any insight on recognizing and managing the beginning of a hypomanic episode, especially when those episodes are so short? They inevitably come from nowhere, presaged by nothing except the fact that I'm feeling good. How about coming to terms with it after you've realized it just happened?

Finally, while I understand that this is probably not enough information to go on, is it a realistic possibility that my polarizing (no pun intended) personality is actually a sign of something else? Maybe that my disorder is worse than I thought, or even something darker (maybe some kind of anti-social or narcissistic tendency)? Is it that loss of self I mentioned earlier (I reiterate, occurred over the course of a long and difficult year) that's making this harder? Or am I just being a jerk about keeping myself in check?

I genuinely want to improve myself and it is a constant struggle to reconcile my best moments with my worst moments. I consider myself stable for the moment, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't hate myself.

In case you didn't know, reddit has added a feature so that subreddits can have their very own wiki. It's pretty cool.

What I've done is I've created a very basic wiki. We currently have only one page, and we're devoting it to replacing our wonderful [Medications: The Master List](http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/exyrf/medications_the_master_list/) to something that can be more dynamically edited. 

As of now, anyone can edit the medications page. A few points for now: 

* You may add new medications, but please classify them by drug type and _please_ keep things in alphabetical order. Be sure to link to the new wikipedia page. 

* Feel free to leave comments about your reactions or thoughts on each relevant medication. We would be much obliged if you would sign it with your username, just so we know who wrote it (especially if someone may want to contact you to ask more questions).

* Please be courteous -- don't delete others' comments. 

* Per our subreddit's rules [posts promoting alternative medicines](http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/m4pm2/psa_references_to_alternative_medicine_as/) will be removed. 

If things get too chaotic, we may need to limit what users may access the page, however in the spirit of this subreddit, I hope we can leave it an open page. 

**[You can check it out here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/wiki/index)**

I think it would be great to add more resource pages. Feel free to make suggestions, and we can add more content as we go. 

I'm SUPER excited about it, and I hope all of you are too.

But there was nothing I could do. This past week has been a crappy one. Yesterday I had to throw some drunk guy out for being a jerk, that got me worked up. Then today I had to take my wife to the hospital because we think she was having a miscarriage (still don't know). 

Then, it got toppled over. Was at work already pretty upset and a guy comes in and starts complaining about the price of his food. Now I work in a pizza shop, and it was just me and him, thankfully. And he's going on and on. I tried to explain it to him and said, ""sorry I don't know what to tell you."" And walked away, at my border line.. hoping he'd leave. 

But no, he stood there, and stared at me. Oh god, so I walked up and started again, trying to help this guy understand and he just goes off on a rant about prices and stuff I have no control over and I just watch myself snap. It was terrible.. I slammed my fists on the table and yelled about not giving a fuck, to just leave and that I didn't care.

Well, I figured I had blown it again. Been here a year and a half without screwing up and I finally lost my mind on a customer. He left, I tried to calm down, and of course it went away pretty quick and I felt better. I figured he'd call next week and file a complaint, not sure what would happen to me then.

But then he called. He apologized for being rude, that he could see the distress in my eyes :-/. I almost cried, apologize, to me? I apologized as well, he forgave me and hung up. Wow.. what a roller coaster.

Just yesterday I realized I was getting close. That I needed to get on my meds again, no insurance so I'm trying to see what I can do. And it was almost too late. In the sense that I lost it before I could get my meds and get under control. But somehow karma was on my side, and I got a customer that felt bad and did the right thing even though it was me that lost it..

I known for the last 6 years I'm Type II Bipolar. I'm on medication but it doesn't completely help with the depression and i still have low level mood swings. I know some people are able to maintain a job dispite this but I don't know how they manage it. 

It seems with me I'm ok for awhile but eventually the stress starts getting to me (even if it's like cashier or something not high in stress) and I start having crying spells and panic attacks at work. I've had to call people to calm me down enough to finish my shifts. 

This has happened multiple times on and off meds. Every job no matter what I try. Any advice on how to maintain a job without getting swamped with depression or panicing? Or if not..

Psychiatric medications, educating myself on my condition, and doing everything right (I probably shouldn't drink, but I still drink) have made this a reality. Four years ago I never would have thought I would be where I am today.

If anyone would like to ask me any questions please do. I have not been here in a long while with my busy life, but I am back and will be on BipolarReddit more often. I decided to make a second Reddit account to use for general stuff and this one will be just for BipolarReddit, so I can be a bit more candid with all of you.

Here's the short end of what has kept me on the path of recovery:

* I take my medications every day. I make it a point not to run out. If I am in a pinch, the pharmacist can help me out for a few days' medication. (Seroquel XR 300mg, 2x @ bedtime; Trileptal (Generic Oxcarbazepine 600mg 2x daily morn/eve)
* I would be lying if I did not say that getting a disability lawyer to award me my Social Security benefits didn't help tremendously. Without my benefits a one month supply of Seroquel XR and Trileptal generic would run me between $800.00 and $900.00 USD.
* Daily exercise. I work a very active job and I generally walk between 9,000 to over 10,00 steps a day. I'm on my feet constantly while I am at work. I also strength train doing a mix of calisthenics (bodyweight exercises) and weights 2 to 3 times a week.
* A healthy diet. I can expand on this if anyone would like me to. I've read that bipolar people tend to do well on high protein diets and my diet is certainly high in protein. I also eat a lot of fish as the Omega-3 fatty acids are great for we bipolar folk. I've read that straight from the fish is best so I try to cook fresh fish often.
* Strong, close, deep friendships with a few people who know my condition. I know that I can count on these people. They have seen me and interacted with me when I was manic and symptomatic so they can alert me and my family to anything that goes awry.
* Strengthening my relationships with my immediate family.
* Periodically reading everything I can get my hands on about bipolar disorder. I have to ask my psychiatrist for some good recommendations.
* Discontinuing using/abusing recreational substances. I still drink, but I don't abuse it. I significantly decreased my alcohol intake over the last three months and I like where I'm at now. If I feel it's getting out of control I have my sister (over 1 year clean thanks to NA), NA (Narcotics Anonymous), friends, and family.

I also credit my interspersed private message chats with KingOfZalo as helping me. He's a nifty dude.

I don't think that any of those things take a rocket scientist to comprehend, but some of what I've done can be difficult lifestyle changes to put into effect.

I tried to do online work but I can't concentrate on writing because thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts (if you know what I mean, which I hope you do).

So today, I went to my neurologist to have the results of my MRI for my spine read. After her diagnosis, I told her that I couldn't sleep and that I was diagnosed with BPD before and its getting worse. She gave me prescriptions for seroquel and rivotril (medicines that I was on) and suggested that I go back and see my shrink. My grandmother came with me to the doctor but she sat outside so she didn't hear what the neuro had to say. In the car, on the way home, I told her. I've been trying to figure out how to tell her because last month I told her I needed to see the doctor again and she just brushed it off. Its increasingly more difficult to ""distract"" myself and I really just want to stop bouncing off walls and not feel in control of how I feel. 

We stopped by a fruit stand to grab some stuff for lunch and when I got back in, she told me that she would cover me for all my medical expenses--except THAT. If I want to get help, I need to do it myself. She recalled a time when she almost had a mental breakdown and she saw a shrink. The shrink talked to her and gave her a prayer and then she said, she made it through. She told me that I can beat it through sheer willpower and that she had to survive for her children. Four years I survived by sheer willpower and its a fucking painful process. At this point, I can't keep it up anymore.

I've made an emergency appt with my p-doc but it's not until Thursday unless he can find something sooner. Losing my job is the peak of the last week, which included a semi-breakdown due to a very vivid dream where I died, which has caused anxiety and panic attacks, and a family member being in the hospital with blood clots in the lungs. I was fine until last Tuesday. Now the depression that I've been free of for over a year is back.

I spent over $1000 through PayPal and GoDaddy was my registrar of choice, when I had no real experience creating websites. I didn't actually have $1,000 so PayPal hassled me to no end until I came up with the money. After my hospital stay I had to deal with the headache of all this. I'd like to say GoDaddy were helpful and understanding but as seems to be the theme to this day they weren't. After many agonizing phone calls through Skype (I'm in Australia) all I could get refunded was $200. The rest of the money and fees, they say were apparently non-negotiable and non-refundable.

tl;dr - spent over $1000 on GoDaddy on a nonsense domain name/hosting when manic as a teenager, GoDaddy couldn't care less after I explained situation, wouldn't refund full amount. 

Another story I have is walking into a car dealership when i was about 18, manic as all hell and test driving than buying a Mitsubishi 380 ($35,000 or something) off the lot and signing up for car repayments and all. I would have drove the car right off the lot if they had one in stock and I wouldn't like to think what would have happened then. Thankfully i was able to explain the situation and nothing came of it.

I've been  to so many different doctors all of my life. About a year ago was diagnosed as bi-polar and dependent/avoidant  personality disorder. A lifetime of being labeled this or that tends to make things confusing, I suppose. ( depression,ocd, gad, adhd)
 Last night something triggered my mania and I've started to become aware of the fact that I have been extremely depressed. My thoughts have been racing, I felt on the verge of insanity. And then I remembered- I am bi-polar. These feelings are nothing new, they are just a result of my disease. 

And then I was overcome with this feeling, this sudden realization, and I remembered that this is not my first time....idk, resurfacing.
I feel like I have been drowning and have just come up for air. So there is this relief, because I can breathe (view things as they are I guess, not skewed), but I am exhausted as one would be from drowning. I am happy to be alive, but I still feel like I almost drowned. It's sobering. I feel like I can reach out again to those that support me, those who love me, even if they don't understand. I still feel like I am up to my chin in water. I'm afraid of going under again before I see my dr in this state. When I am not ""present"" I am not honest with him.  I feel like I am back in the real world. Relieved but very, very confused.

How have you learned to cope in life without medication?",26,5,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/nhsok/if_i_knew_then_what_i_know_now_please_share/,"I see a lot of posts around here, with people wondering whether being medicated is the right thing for them.


For me, my indecision about medications led to inconsistencies in taking my doses, which led to some suicide attempts. I was frightened away from the idea of medication, and have felt very lonely on my path. I have often wished I could talk to someone who has done this already, who has decided to live this way, to know what it was like for them - whether they thought they made the right decision, whether it was worth it. There must be others who aren't on medication. Why not share some of our experience on what life is like for varying degrees of Bipolar living off-meds (for whatever reason it might be).

disclaimers:

*Please don't attack me, as I am not implying that this is the right / only / best way to live life. Some people simply cannot function off meds, some people have experienced major breakthroughs in life after getting on the right kind of medication. It really can be miraculous. There is tons of support for you in this subreddit, links, anecdotes, encouragement and reasons why you should try it if you never have before. All I'm saying is that it wasn't for me and I wish I knew then what I know now. I'm open to meds in the future if need be, but as for right now, No thank you.*

**I am not suggesting that you stop taking medication. I don't know you, you don't know me, we are different people and this is just my own way of coping with the reality that I chose. Please don't do anything drastic just because it seems to be working for some random on the internet.**

Here is what I've learned so far. It is far from complete.

* Life without meds is messy and fucking difficult. I have ruined relationships and had to seriously accept some ugly truths about myself. It hurts, badly. My perception of the world, my place in it, the nature of feeling, has matured and changed as I've tried to come to grips with my irrational pointless extreme moods.

* No matter how difficult it gets, I vow to every particle on this planet, **I will not kill myself.**

* If it gets so bad that I feel I cannot keep that vow, I will get myself on the path to medication.

* I will not go on medication unless I am 100% dedicated to doing it. No half assing, missing doses, going on and off them because I'm unsure about whether this is indeed the right path. 100% on them, or 100% off them. It will still be extremely difficult, but I must be dedicated to finding the right substance / mix / doctor / dosage for me. I must accept that it will take months to accomplish this.

* I must accept that certain people / triggers / substances / situations must be avoided for the sake of my well being. I have to put my emotional well being as a higher priority to my impulsive desire to have fun and exciting experiences. If you seriously can not do this, if the mania in you has too much control, this lifestyle may not be for you and the need for you to take medication might be one of those ugly truths you learn about yourself.

* You can build a new you on the ruins of who you are. Positivity is possible. It might not be the life you expected to live when you were young, but neither was sitting in your bed with no desire or ambition. Going with the above point, you need to prioritize and protect your achievements from yourself. Knowing yourself, and knowing your patterns, will help a lot. Having a private accessible outlet, like a journal or sketchbook or tape recorder, is essential.


Please add your points to the mix as well. Anecdotes, life experience, regrets... was it worth it? Do you wish you had done things differently?

I started with an anti-depressant alone, but my first competent psychiatrist quickly decided SSRIs are a no-go and we landed on Wellbutrin shortly thereafter. I still wonder how he decided it worked before adding a mood stabilizer and anti-psychotic to actually stabilize me, but that first year is somewhat of a haze. My body adapts quite readily to medication, including those that theoretically don't incur tolerance after a while, and the benefits are relatively short-lived.  In the last eight years I've been on over 20 head meds in various cocktails with distinct periods of relative stability never lasting over a year.  I'm currently quite under-medicated for my condition because I've basically run out of options. I'm in the process of getting my insurance to authorize ECT, but attempting that out-patient is a cluster fuck (pardon language).

To the point of the post, it seems I see increasingly more people rejecting their diagnoses and/or treatment for any number of reasons, including being enamored with mania/hypomania. I have a simple piece of advice; DON'T.  If you haven't found meds that work, keep trying; if you find meds that work, never stop taking them without the agreement of your psychiatrist. Find a highly competent psychiatrist and tell him everything, all the time; it matters.  I know mania is great, but if you have bipolar disorder you have an illness that requires constant vigilant treatment. Accept it and do what you can to function in society, because that's life and that's reality.

I know my experience doesn't apply to everyone diagnosed bipolar; find what works for you and do it.  Just please don't cling to the illness like it's a good thing and refuse to treat it.  It's real; it's not going away; and odds are good if you do nothing to deal with it it will get worse.

I'd like to kill myself as much as the next whack-job (no offense), but I have extensive family and friends and they'd be rather upset if I did, so I'm sucking it up and dealing because that's what life's about.

TL;DR  if you're diagnosed bipolar, accept it because it's not going away, and find treatment that works for you, no matter how long it takes; if it stops working, do it again.",,False,,t5_2qzru,False,,,True,t3_jso1i,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/jso1i/what_ive_learned_after_8_years_in_treatment/,

I am very inexperienced in relationships, never been in any kind of relationship before, but I am in a good place in life right now, and am looking for and ready for a serious relationship. My main issues have been serious anxiety disorders all my life, including social anxiety, where I have a difficult time interacting. But I have made vast improvement in the last couple years, and I feel I have a strong understanding of what it means to not be in control of your emotions and to be forced to act irrationally

I am kind of odd in this way, and feel like my conversational ability matches well with those I've known with bipolar. I easily follow the constant jumping of topics, and create my own meaning out of some of the craziness which is very special to me.

I met this girl online, and have been on one date. and she told me she had bipolar. She told me she takes at least 2 meds for it. However, She expressed herself to me as if she is already in love with me as soon as we met; she was very physical, could not keep her hands off me, kissing me on the lips within 5 minutes of meeting.

Since we went out, she says we are boyfriend and girlfriend, she already tells me she wants to move in with me in time, and that she believes we will get married. She sends me messages, calls, and texts around the clock. Quite over the top, and I don't know the best way to respond, and how to handle her expression towards me in a positive relationship building way. I really want to get to know this girl as a person, and understand her the best I can, and move toward a long term relationship and see what happens.

She lives with family, works part-time, doesn't seem to have any friends or social circle outside of family.

Is this relationship possible??, I am willing to assume the risks, and make a serious go at it, how do I proceed?, I know very little about bipolar, so what do I do when she goes into a depression? How difficult is this going to be? Thanks.

He did very little to care for me. He ran a few tests before sending me for involuntary psychiatric care without even speaking to me (I arrived unconscious) or completing a psych evaluation - a move that my regular psychologist called ""flat out abusive"". This doctor's ego was so large that he even had my SO escorted out by security when he questioned the wisdom of my involuntary treatment despite the lack of personal interaction. The doctor claimed that my SO ""threatened"" him when he said that he would be following up about my care. This experience was the worst medical experience that I have ever had. I came into the ER with a physiological problem (I hadn't kept any food down for 3 days and eventually crashed) and was Baker Acted before I woke up because of my psychiatric history. I laid in the ER in and out of consciousness for over two hours before they hooked me up to some fluids. If the doctor had just talked to me, when I woke up, or even better, asked my family (who is extremely supportive and was there with me) he would have discovered that my psychiatric problems have been well under control lately. There was nothing the psych hospital could do for me that I wasn't already doing with better care providers.

I have been a little manic lately and have been getting my medications adjusted frequently, but my family and I have been doing a great job keeping me safe. I see a clinical psychologist every Monday, my psychiatrist every other week, I am part of a support group that meets every Thursday and am completely compliant with my medications. This has felt like a setback for me (because most of my hospitalizations in the past were during setback periods) and I'm doing my best to not let it get me down because I know I've done really well lately.

For me it was a decision made in my 40th birthday. I decided to definitely stop the dating game. Too many failures and they translate into too many frustrations. Also, women that are my type generally look for healthy guys who have a lot of stability (money).

I've decided to deal with it by going back to many activities I've left behind since I started living my ""single"" life (my last meaningful relationship ended 8 years ago). I've come back to yoga, meditation, sports and a lot of reading. Actually I've been like this for a couple of months now and it actually feels very good! No anxiousness about finding ""the right one"" anymore. I still go to clubs and party, and sometimes I may even have a one night stand, but it'd have to be something kept simple.

So, how do you deal with it?

I was diagnosed with Bipolar II about a month and half ago, after a depressive 'episode' which lasted a good two and a half months despite me being on Pristiq (anti-depressant). And then had a 4 day hypomanic episode a few days after it stopped. I got new meds (Lamictal) and I felt good. Stable for the most part. Except these random mood swings which usually last for 1 to 4 hours. They are shorter lived now on my meds, but they still happen and I am at a lost. I am a girl but they don't line up with my periods and I had been hoping that my new meds would make them disappear but they don't.

Hi every, little time lurker, but I wanted to introduce myself and post because I need some support right now from people who ""get it."" I want to tell my whole story, but if you don't want to read I will, of course, include a TL;DR.

I am a 27/F. My problems began in my second year of college. Up until then I had been a stellar student; graduated High School on the Honor Roll, 11th in my class with a Regents Diploma (a New York State thing, I think). Honor Society, Scholar/Athlete, the whole deal. Started working in a pharmacy at the age of 16 and had decided my dream was to become a pharmacist (and not just for the money, I swear!). Got accepted into every pharmacy school I applied to, decided on going to college in Boston. Had a great first year at school, despite coming down with mono that spring semester. Second year of school rolls around and funny things start happening to me. Suddenly, I can't sleep. I don't mean, can't fall asleep til 2am, I mean awake for 36 hours and body won't sleep. I know things aren't right so I see the school counselor who told me it was nothing and wanted me to bring in a tape for our next session so he could tape some ""soothing sounds"" for me to fall asleep to and told me I didn't really have a problem. Needless to say, I never went back. GPA dropped from a 3.7 to a 1.8 at the end of the school year. Spent that summer as an intern in my pharmacy and planned to make up the courses I had failed that summer; never happened and I voluntarily decided not to go back. When I had come home from school that second year, mom was livid, after I explained the problems I was having she decided that I just needed to ""get over it"" and that I didn't have an actual problem. I knew something wasn't right, but now I had people telling me that I was fine and needed to just get past whatever it was, so I continued on. Attended the local community college that next fall (I was 20) and failed there too because I was too sad?/lazy?/depressed? to schlep myself to class. 

It wasn't until 2006 that I decided on my own to seek professional help because things weren't getting better and I had been in a relationship I was unconsciously sabotaging through my behavior (weird manic episodes, crazy bouts of extreme depression). Psychiatrist diagnosed me as Bipolar Mixed (not sure if that's I or II) and subsequently started me on Zoloft and Lamictal. Zoloft zombied me out so we switch to Celexa and Lamictal, which were tapered up to 60mg/day and 150mg/day, respectively. 

Things were okay for a while after that; I didn't feel full of crazy anymore, I doggedly attended school (to my ultimate detriment, but at the time because of my parents concern [uh, over my school, not well-being] I never thought it an option to *not* go to school. I had no plan, well to be honest I had many plans: one day I was going to become an EMT, another day a laboratory technician, whatever sounded like it could get me a job at the time. Took a smattering of college classes that didn't really lead to much, but raised my GPA enough to get into a local private college where I decided to just get my undergrad in Biology so I could at least attempt to go back to pharmacy school in the future. 

Family relationships have ultimately crumbled; my mother co-signed on my initial loans for college and when I was on hiatus they began coming due and I just didn't pay them. This has led to them going into collection, my credit score is absolute shit, and in turn has affected my mother's credit score, which she reminded me about non-stop and I feel like a fucking tool. We haven't spoken since last August. My father's side of my family (parents divorced) treats me like the black sheep. They have great relationships with each other, but no one talks to me unless they have to. It's...awful, and hurtful. I know I've let my family down in so many ways because of what I've been going through, but they all seem just as happy to write me out of their lives.

Fast forward to the last two years or so. I am trying and failing at college once more because I cannot get out of bed some days. Have taken two online courses through the university, received A's, because I could work at them from home, at my own pace. Every other course is a D-. Now the sleep thing is happening again. I also have a job. It's a great job in a pharmacy I like, but some days I just cannot get out of fucking bed. And when I say some days, I mean most. About 8 months ago my boss had to pull my health insurance because I wasn't netting 20 hours a week. Now I net between 8-10 a week. I am actually surprised I have not yet been fired, and I really think it may just be a matter of time now.

I truly don't know why I can't get out of bed/leave the house. My alarm goes off, I look at it, and just think to myself ""no, not today. just don't feel like it."" I have no health insurance so I cannot see a doctor. Well, I could, but it would cost quite a bit of money out-of-pocket, money which I don't have because I work so few hours. A vicious cycle is happening. I haven't been able to afford my meds so I stopped them a few months ago. At that point, I wasn't convinced they were doing anything anyway, but couldn't see a doctor to get adjusted or re-diagnosed. 

So here I am. I am almost 10 years outside of high school with no college degree. I look like a lazy fool in front of my work colleagues. Because I have no degree I have a generally low-paying job and I have a ton of debt and a credit score that can't buy me a bicycle, let alone the fact that I should be buying a car or my first house at this age. I am in a relationship in which my SO has been tolerant/patient of me not paying my fair share in the relationship, but I don't think it can last must longer since he has expressed contempt at having to be the sole-breadwinner. I feel like a complete and utter failure in all aspects of my life and yes, I've contemplated suicide more than once. 

I think my next step is to apply for SSI/SSDI (not actually, sure of the difference, or if I could even qualify). I still very badly want to be a pharmacist, and there is one school (here in the States) that has a completely online program for my Pharm.D, and I am one class away from having my pre-requisites complete to be accepted. Only problem, I'm positive my GPA will not qualify me anymore, and I have to give up my dream. 

I'm not sure what I wanted out of posting here, I think just some words of support or encouragement, or even an ""I've so been there."" Anyone?

(sorry for spelling/grammar...it's 3am and I'm just tired and frustrated)

I had few to no friends as a kid because I was withdrawn, very lethargic....a tendency that alternated with feelings of invigoration when I would become suddenly determined to make friends and believe I was someone people would want to be friends with.


In middle school I started having relationships with overage men and tried various plots to escape from home and start new lives in faraway places. 

I struggled throughout High School until my hospitalizations Junior year where I was diagnosed bipolar after a SSRI induced mania. 

Throughout my life it was like everyone was so scared of what I'd do next that, to cope, they just tried to pretend I wasn't there or ridicule me into submission.

It's been a year and the meds work. They make me stable and I can have smooth emotional states where I have a continuous energy level, control over my impulses and my thoughts of suicide are gone. I'm in the spectrum of normal...people suddenly feel comfortable getting close to me, they engage me first in conversation...sit next to me, invite me to hang out. It's what I've always wanted...to be included.

But so much is gone. I never knew how much of me would die at the hands of mood stabilizers...My opinionated, unabashed demeanor, my daring, my creativity, my intensity, the devastating quality of emotions and sensation....

I went off my meds and now I'm depressed beyond anything I've experienced before. I went off because I need to do some creative writing for a class project...but I also want to be *interesting* again. I want to feel like the person I've been all my life.

But, it's so disheartening, that people like the medicated me more. How am I supposed to feel about that? They like a chemically altered me, but what about...just me? 

Between not inducing the hypomania I need to complete the project that is due in days and coming to the realization that I am naturally an unlikeable person...defective.

I get almost no warning, and then I am in the chasm of despair again. And if it happens too soon, I will be left with a dirty kitchen and a half painted home. 

I have started new medication. That has something to do with it, I know. It's hard to know sometimes whether you are hypomanic or if you are feeling a motivation that the rest of the population does when they get things done and take on large tasks. 

I have been diagnosed for a long time (I was bipolar before bipolar was cool. Haha) so I am accustomed to The inconvenience of episodes. I don't really know whether I wanted the point of this post to be -Hey, everything is great, -I am scared of when the other shoe will drop, - I need to vent, -Got any ideas so I can stay on cloud 9?

I just spent 90 days in a psych hospital that cost me my job about five months ago. It was my 11 time being hospitalized in 10 years. 

Im not suicidal but I give up. I have been a writer my whole life and have been published a few times or journalism. I know I can write. Im working on a novel and I believe that my unique experiences in life is going to give me a valuable unique perspective on life. 

Im at the earliest of early stages of starting a magazine with a man I met through reddit. 

I have projects that I am working on , I keep busy. 

Im just lost. I have maybe two friends that I see about once a week. I have the semblence of normal but I dont have an apartment and I dont have a car and I dont really feel like I have more than 1st world problems which are problems but not really.

How bad are hospitalizations for ones life happiness? I feel like a freak because Im not psychotic enough to be a true mental patient and I am not healthy enough to be a true upstanding member of society. I have a college degree and a disability diagnosis from the government.

This is all I do. I sit and I write and I am trying to create my first novel story and its going well. I love the story I am writing. I am working on a franchise manual for a vegan restaurant and he loves my work.

this might be the last slow year I have but this could be my entire life , writing these words and living with my parents.

I dont need a kick in the ass , I need to get out there and create. I need to take my unique vision of the world and craft realizations that help people see society from a different light. 

I need to take my psychosis and paint pictures on reality that people can learn from. 

This is what I tell myself. I tell myself that I live with my parents in a nice house and this is an opportunity to write. To pen that novel and see if I have a novel in me. 

We spoke and I am going to be not applying for work for the next year and work strictly on my novel. I am 345 pages into it now and that is after spending 2 months working to get my last book of poetry on amazon.

I feel like I have potential to turn my bipolar syndrome into something special but im alone in dealing with mental illness. I feel like my friends tolerate me and I always say awkward phrases that ruin vibes.

I smoke pot. 

I would love to do some ecstacy. 

I just dont know, its like the problems that i have are with my place in society. i think i just want to write and i know its a paupers decision that will lead to no ability to support a family. At 31 im not thinking about family because i have a feeling it will never come and in that realization there is just this, this is the rest of my life and that scares me that its just this and more of this until this ends.

It took me ten years to graduate from college and i majored in five degrees before i finished with english literature. i know mental health problems are heavy in the literary world and i am no different.

I want to start something but i dont have the resources to begin. I tell myself that there is no difference between you and a CEO of P&amp;G they just have been doing it longer. We all sit at the same keyboard its your mind state that dictates your future. 

My parents basically tolerate me and my brother wont talk to me and my sister wont acknowledge me and my other brother lives in california. 

I know if I went somewhere and just lived a homeless life I would be satisfied if the weather was nice. 

Im a bum. Im not corporate, I have a decent work history but no long term work history.

I know I probably sound strange but does anyone else have high intellect  and a strange life history involving mental health problems?

I tested into the 92% percentile of the air force entrance exam some two years ago. I did well on it.

I feel like my intelligence should know how to get out of this and land me entrepreneurial work that can lead me to sustainable life. 

How do you start a business with nearly $100 a month total? I mean I dont know I am trying to help people by writing books for them and have a client right now that I am working with. I have my own book and a friend is also interested but he probably isnt serious.

I take the bus to get around town but that turns a simple chore into a day long procedure which ruins the ability to get a business started. Im just kind of lost is all.

I have high functioning problems the ability to start a business but the mental history that symies that. 

This doesnt even feel like a post that will make much sense and this is the type of person that I am and this is what i talk about and this is why I am ignored but not really ignored because this is pseudo intelligent speech but its not really.

I dont even hate life I just look at it. Do you ever stare at life? Just looking at it wondering how this could be real? I mean isnt just a life enough? Do not all of my problems stem from greed? The want of money? The want of family life? The want of success? Isnt that greed and the essence of greed but isnt that even a thought that gives me permission to be poor.

Arent I trying to give myself permission for this life I have? I am seeking permission for living with parents at 31 and writing and doing nothing else. I know people have to work and they provide me with everything I have but I am not one of the workers, I am one of the writers and this is what I do and I am working to become better at it to master it even but i have such a mental health history that i have self esteem issues that cause me to doubt myself heavily.

I doubt that I will ever see the light of day financially to even live in an apartment.
I doubt that any woman could ever love this. 
I doubt that I will ever see my own child at the dinner table eating their tofu sandwich.
I doubt that I will ever find someone to love me in this entire world because I know that if I find that person I will screw it up. 

What do you do when your soul mate finds you unnattractive? isnt that the saddest, thats what happens to me. 

I just want someone to tell me , you are brilliant now go do something brilliant and be there for me and walk with me as I grow as an artist. That is too much to ask isnt it? Whose time is so invaluable that they would be interested in speaking with an artist who wants to be a writer?

We all have so little time on our hands but not me, I have plenty of it. I have time to write like this. I have time to write these posts. Im annoying arent i? Just too much of a blessed person who wants too much from the world.

part of me just wants to sit and think and there is no pay for that but my parents are the types of people that they will let you live with them and berate you at the same time.

id be better off homeless. just standing in the street staring at all of the strangeness that life is.

does this even make sense, i know it doesnt, but this is how I think this is how my chain of consciousness ties me to the ground.

I feel bad for feeling bad for myself because I dont feel like 10 hospitalizations is something to be sad about but i am sad and feel bad for myself for having experienced that. 

Im just not normal and this writing isnt normal and im not normal and normal people have jobs and apartments and a woman and a car and i dont have any of that and i feel terrible about that.

i want to delete this but ill just waste your time anyways.

I've felt this way all my life. Or at least, as much of my life as I can remember. I've always been prone to being incredibly depressed and I learned to just hide it. When I got older, I began to develop lots of things I would later be told can be attributed to mania. I'd get periods of insomnia where sleep was completely out of the question. Some of the time, I'd still have endless energy. Other times I'd just be an empty husk of former life. My thoughts always raced. I'd get extremely angry at myself and was prone to doing things like hitting myself in the face if I felt I had done something extremely stupid. I'd wish harm on myself when I fucked things up.

I went through my high school and college years like this. I dated people and had some very meaningful relationships. I tried to put all this away in some deep drawer somewhere inside me. I told myself they were just personality flaws I had to work to change. When I failed, I was harder on myself. I told myself I was perfect so that I'd forget about the flaws I was trying to cover up. I became arrogant. And people never suspected a thing. I was the cocky guy who everyone loved. I could pick up chicks if I wanted to, but I never did.

I'll admit, there were things I couldn't hide. In a manic episode I dropped out of college and moved 3 hours away to a town where I only knew one person. I got a job and lived with that person for 6 months before I moved back and re-enrolled in college. I had some depression that went noticed, but it was really just the tip of the iceberg. The whole time I lived like this, I prided myself on my mind. I was convinced I was overcoming things by power of will and I already knew I was smarter than most of my peers. People have done nothing but confirm that. Mental illness was actually my biggest fear in life because I thought that without my mind I was nothing.

Last year, around November, I felt normal for the first time in my whole adult life. I was a senior in college. I met a woman because well, she was my teacher. I don't know what it is about her, but I liked her from the moment I saw her. It wasn't physical attraction. I thought she was cute but that wasn't it. She looked like a nerd (which is a complete turn on) but that wasn't it either. She looked intelligent, which is a must for me, but that wasn't it either. I still don't know what it was. I didn't fall in love right there. I just really liked her and told myself ""Her, I will date her."" And I did. I dated the grad student who taught me (she's a redditer too but I doubt she'll see this and I don't want to drag her into it) and it was great. It wasn't manic like my other relationships. I got depressed a few times but there wasn't anything too bad. All in all, it was the most normal time of my whole life. I knew she was leaving the city (and state, for that matter) when she graduated that following summer so I tried to stay away from a deep relationship. So did she. A month before she was scheduled to leave, we drove from Florida to New York to return her parent's car. I had agreed to help her drive it up and she bought me a plane ticket back down. I figured it would be a free vacation and a last outing with the girl who was soon to leave. We realized on the trip that we had failed at out goal: we had fallen in love and we didn't want to say our goodbyes. She was moving across the country but I agreed I'd follow her 6 months later once I graduated and was applying to graduate schools. I've never been happier than I was that week up in New York. We loved each other and for once in my life it all felt real. We daydreamed of the not-so-distant future and I guess I was a little more honest than she was. I really did want that future. She left on her trip and we began to be long distance.

With her gone, something in me started to get worse. I told myself it was stupid and that she wasn't the reason I had felt normal. I was normal because I was normal. But I still got worse. I slipped into one of the worst depressive states I've ever been in. I confided in my long-distance love and she seemed supportive - urged me to go to counseling. After that talk, I had the courage to finally realize what had been going on - I was bipolar. I knew all along and I had been lying to myself for so long. I had actually even told people I was before but it was mostly just an excuse for my bad days. I began to try to get help when my long distance relationship went the way most do. She called me one day and had already made the decision. There was no talk, although I tried. She couldn't wait for me. She had suspected all along she couldn't wait, but she said she genuinely wanted to try for me. To this day I'm still not sure if I'm honored that I'm that desirable or offended that my well-being was played with in such a way.

That was the breaking point. My defenses had come down and so much stuff that had never been dealt with was now out in the open. I've been in therapy with both a psychiatrist and a psychologist for 3 months and I haven't gotten any better. My psychiatrist keeps telling me I need to be patient and I'm trying to believe her but its just too hard. I'm becoming impatient with trying to get results from a medicine and my condition is getting worse. I can feel my sanity slipping from me. Instead of hearing someone whispering to me I get the distinct feeling something was just whispered to me. I get easily distracted by sounds and I focus on them; They amplify in my mind until they are all I can hear. My thoughts race; I think so fast it feels like by the time I finish one thought I'm already halfway through another. 

I know some people have it worse than I do. I know some have it better. I don't know what I expect from this but if you read this far, I really do thank you. I've wanted to tell this whole story to someone who I wasn't paying for a long time. But parts of it I just can't. I can't admit my recent ex means that much to me. I can't admit some of my mental problems are really as serious as they are. I don't want people to view me as insane. I don't want my ideas to be written off. I don't want people to know how hard it really is for me to hold on.

I haven't really made any attempts to hide my identity. Someone who I know will probably read this and if so, it's your call what you do with this information. I'll omit my ex's name because I've never met someone else with her name. To put it here would be asking for her to search it and return this post. Part of me hopes she never finds out how much she meant to me, part of me thinks that she already knows and part of me hopes she is the first person to read this. If you do, I know you're gone and you'll never be part of my life again but maybe this made you understand me a little more.

Please seek professional psychiatric guidance, and help. This PSA is simply meant to inform, and provide information.*

**Antidepressants (SSRIs like Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Lexapro, and SNRIs like Effexor, etc.) alone can trigger [rapid cycling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder#Rapid_cycling), [hypomania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania), [mixed states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_episodes), or [mania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_episodes) in someone who is bipolar. If someone is bipolar and taking an antidepressant they should also be on a [mood stabilizing medication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_stabilizer) (Lamictal, Lithium, etc.) or [atypical antipsychotic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypical_antipsychotic) in addition to an antidepressant ([1](http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=11217), [2](http://helpguide.org/mental/bipolar_disorder_medications.htm), [3](http://www.psycheducation.org/bipolar/controversy.htm)).**

Within the last several years many people have sought help from their doctors for depression with anxiety, and been put on an antidepressant. Unfortunately a number of these patients experience [rapid cycling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder#Rapid_cycling), [hypomania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania), [mixed states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_episodes), or [mania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_episodes) shortly after starting treatment on antidepressant medications, and then are diagnosed with [bipolar disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder). When this happens it means that the person likely suffers from some form of [mood disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_disorder). It is important to see a psychiatrist to determine which mood disorder, as there are many mood disorders, as well as several forms of bipolar disorder and they are treated differently. A general doctor is not qualified to make a diagnosis, you must see a psychiatrist or psychologist. Since [bipolar disorder is a spectrum disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_spectrum) between mania and depression it is not the same as [unipolar depression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unipolar_depression). With what is now known about bipolar disorder we know that antidepressant medications alone can trigger [rapid cycling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder#Rapid_cycling), [hypomania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania), [mixed states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_episodes), or [mania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_episodes), and should be accompanied by a [mood stabilizing medication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_stabilizer) or [atypical antipsychotic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypical_antipsychotic).

If you are only on an antidepressant and believe you are bipolar and experiencing [rapid cycling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder#Rapid_cycling), [hypomania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania), [mixed states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_episodes), or [mania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_episodes) you should contact a psychiatrist immediately. If you do not have a psychiatrist you can contact your insurance company for a referral, or if you are a student you can contact your schools counseling department. If you do not have insurance you can find more resources on our [Do not self diagnose; Steps to getting help PSA](http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/ev419/psa_do_not_selfdiagnose_steps_to_getting_help/).

To put everything simply: if you are bipolar and on an antidepressant without a mood stabilizer odds are you may be making your condition worse, and you need to consult a psychiatrist. If your psychiatrist insists that an antidepressant alone is fine for someone who is bipolar you should get a second opinion (I am talking specifically about SSRIs and SNRIs).

No, really. Wildlife animal documentaries are seriously the best way to fall asleep I've ever come across. I'll put on a documentary narrated by David Attenborough and I'll lay there watching the wonder that is our planet... with the soothing voice of David calmly explaining to me the beautiful nature of it all.

Eventually you slowly drift off to sleep and you don't even realize it.

Made an earlier appointment with my psychiatrist after I hit 140 on vacation. Apparently he was thinking of the quetiapine (Seroquel) as primarily for sleep, so he took me off it and gave me trazadone instead. I am kind of leery of going back to just lamotrigine &amp; Cymbalta for everything, so he gave me some samples of Saphris in case I start feeling crazy. It's true that I had a lot of crazy life shit going on when I first went on the Abilify followed by Seroquel XR then straight non-XR, but it still makes me nervous. Fortunately, my boyfriend is pretty good at watching and interpreting my various swings. He'll help me keep an eye on things.

As for sleep, tried the trazadone last night and was pleased. I like that I take it a while before sleep. It let me read for a while until I was ready to fall asleep naturally.

Regardless of your situation, I would like to share mine while I'm in an emotional state because I feel it is somewhat unique for someone with a mental disorder and I am just now beginning to realize how blessed I was for things to have turned out this way. (I'm on mood stabilizers, so manic episodes are the only time I cry or feel a need to socialize.)

Both my parents are PhDs in psychology. My dad used to work for a hospital as a chronic pain psych. Now, he works at at my former college as a psych for students. My mom has worked in schools as a counselor for almost her entire career since she got her PhD. 

Before I began my freshman year of high school, it began. I can't remember whether I asked my mom to take me to see somebody or whether she expressed concern and asked if I wanted to, but either way, I agreed to see a psychiatrist in town.

She took a while struggling to figure me out. Eventually, she settled on atypical bipolar disorder which I suppose is now called bipolar disorder NOS (not otherwise specified). 

Over the next nine years, I tried a variety of disastrous medications. Tried Lithium and had the worst manic episode yet which caused me to be taken to the hospital due to potential dehydration in order to avoid lithium toxicity. It was not fun. I made my mother cry by spewing anger at her. I called a nurse names I would never call someone; he got up and stormed out before my IV was in. Keep in mind my dad was there and the medical community is fairly tight knit, so him being there next to me that first night was perhaps not unusual for his profession, but also had the potential to spread vicious gossip. I guess that wasn't something he cared about. I got out after a week or so, but it was as low as I've sunk.

After that, we settled on two other mood stabilizers. Although they make it difficult to focus and articulate ideas which can be very frustrating as a writer, I try to overlook this and realize the side effects I had on other medications such as blurry vision (while wearing glasses), vomiting, toxicity, and the potential to **[grow breasts as a man on Risperdal](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-24/j-j-hid-risks-risperdal-makes-boys-breasts-grow-lawyer.html)**, this seemed like something I could live with.

Over the years, I have tried to place a lot of blame for my bipolar disorder on my genes (my mother's side has a history of mental disorders), parents, the city I live in, and just about anything else I could blame that wasn't me. 

**Eventually, I realized the biggest obstacle to happiness in life is yourself. Whether it's not getting sleep when you're manic or not doing anything productive when you're depressed, we are ultimately responsible for this. Bipolar disorder affects it, but is not entirely to blame.**

Without my family, I think I would be in a totally different situation now. I imagine I might be in a psychiatric hospital because I have considered going there at times despite my family's love, so if I lacked that completely I feel that would be needed. 

I guess I will write the rest of this for myself, but I never want to forget how much I love my family. 

* I wouldn't have had a loving male ""father"" figure in my life without my brother. 

* I wouldn't have someone to help me be productive and run toward my fears if I didn't have my dad. 

* I wouldn't have someone I love and who loves me and who I feel I could tell anything to if I didn't have my mom.

* I wouldn't have someone who understands my weaknesses and tries to help eliminate them rather than let them persist if I didn't have my sister. 

Unfortunately, I do not see my brother much anymore because he is several years older and lives in another state with a family of his own now. But I still have my family, and I think it's time I started showing them the love they showed me.  

I am currently in the worst part of a manic episode though. Didn't sleep at all last night. Tried, but just couldn't get to sleep. There are so many things about to converge in on my life that I feel like it doesn't even matter if I'm ready because I've never felt ready anyway. So take that with what I've said as well. I can usually get through a manic episode without much trouble, but I guess living with my parents again mixed with other stuff triggers some bad stuff.

And Animal Crossing New Leaf comes out at midnight. That can't be helping.

--------------
Bob and Tom are sharing a hospital room. Separated by a curtain they acknowledge one another's existence but no words are exchanged beyond, ""Hello.""

When the doctor enters the room, he first visits with Tom. Tom is a pain management patient. A decade prior he had been forced off the interstate by a careless driver and ended up with a steel utility pole in the center of his engine block. He had cracked and crushed a handful of vertebrae in his back. Since that day, Tom is in a constant state of nagging pain. Every few weeks the pain becomes too much and, as he did today, Tom makes his way to the hospital for a special injection to find relief from the pain.

The doctor asks Tom, ""On a scale of 1 to 10, how much pain are you in?"" Tom responds, ""I was at an 8 and now I am relieved at a 4. I feel so much better."" Tom is still in a fair amount of pain, but it's to a degree that he can now tolerate.

The doctor then moves to Bob. Bob is in because he broke his big toe. He had it set and was given a boot to wear. The doctor asks Bob the same question, ""On a scale of 1 to 10, how much pain are you in."" Bob responds, ""I was at an 8 when I broke it, a 5 when I came in and I'm at a 4 now, but only when I walk on it."" Bob is honestly still in some amount of pain. But is Bob's pain as severe as Tom's pain?

We can assume the Tom is in a fair bit more pain than Bob. But if we look only at the subjective scale that each of them used, we would conclude that they are experiencing the same intensity of pain. But such is the nature of a subjective scale.

-------------------------------------------------------------

To convey the idea that we use the same words as everyone else to describe something completely different. We use the same scale to rate vastly more intense emotion. 

It makes it easy for it to stay hidden and destroy someone from the inside out. It is a cause for so many that go without treatment and diagnosis. It fuels denial and ignorance and is a travesty to the reality of what we experience.

I've researched it quite a lot, but I really don't want to write anything that is utterly inaccurate, or a terrible or even insulting portrayal. I want it to be as realistic, open and unpolished as possible, not a glossy Hollywood sort of story. I have mostly avoided films, TV or books with bipolar characters mainly because I've read a lot about them being pale or over exaggerated depictions of bipolar disorder, although I did see Silver Linings Playbook. I'm going to watch Stephen Fry's documentary at some point, too.

That same year I had a minor nervous breakdown and had to take a month off college. I was misdiagnosed as depressive and given paroxetine. After a year of taking that and smoking a lot of weed, I had a maniac episode followed by psychotic break and had to be hospitalised for 6 weeks; there I was finally diagnosed as bipolar. I managed to go back to college and now I'm in my senior year, and I'm doing pretty well. However...

I might have overreacted, but for the past weeks, one of the girls I hang out with is constantly talking about how *she* might be bipolar. I've known this clique since kindergarten, save for this girl whom we met in high school. We've never seen eye to eye, and I know for sure she's not fond of me at all.

Regardless of that, another of the girls told her to simply ""pop some valproic acid lol"". LOL, I've been taking that shit for the last two years! It made me gain weight! Granted, when I was hospitalised I was weighing 100 pounds, now I'm around 120 but I had to cut down on food because this med opens your apetite. LOL, it also made me lose hair and it can affect your period! Awesome!

Anyway, when I pointed out that this conversation (we were all talking on whatsapp) might be offensive for me, they fucking tore me apart. Apparently, I'm a selfish cunt for not thinking about my poor little friend (who's never shown compassion for me), and for being offended at ""bipolar"" being flung around as if it's like having the flu.

Well, fuck them. I know that I felt really hurt, and I'm sick and tired of never getting an ounce of understanding from any of them. And now this shit? Did anybody come to visit me at the clinic? Nope, just my then-boyfriend and parents. 

Have I overreacted, or am I right in being at least a bit annoyed? Thanks, BipolarReddit.

My brother has always been a little ""out there,"" but last year around this time he hit rock bottom and ended up being involuntarily committed by my mother. The doctors at the psychiatric institution he was at did not reach a conclusive diagnosis, and he was released. 

For the last year he was able to hold a job, maintain relationships, and seemed to be doing well overall. There were definitely instances in which he seemed delusional or paranoid, but for the most part he was functioning well.

Earlier this week his friends felt threatened enough to call the cops on him, and he ended up being arrested and taken to the ER. He was then involuntarily committed again by my mother, but this time the doctor diagnosed him with Bipolar I and is fighting for him to get treated. My brother is vehemently against any sort of ""mainstream"" medical treatment or science. He does not believe that he is ill, or that it can be helped with treatment. 

He has phone privileges, so I have been talking to him 2-3 times a day since Tuesday. I am one of the few people in my family who he trusts and will be open with. He signed a medical release form so I can be in contact with his doctor. He thinks that he is going to get out soon, but his doctor wants to take him to court to have him stay for 60 days in order to get treatment. 

For anyone who has been in this situation before or anyone who is Bipolar, what advice do you have for communicating with my brother while he is in this fragile state? What should I avoid talking about?

Fortunately that news publication has an online equivalent. Here are those stories in order of relevance:

* http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/07/police_searching_for_missing_m.html

* http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/07/man_searched_for_in_lake_found.html

I would rather not copy and paste the text of these two articles. Some of the information included in the articles is incorrect and, since this was over 4 years ago, nothing in the articles is what I would consider to be sensitive information.

On July 6, 2008 I went fully manic and psychotic. Looking back now, I was revving up into severe mania for a month or two before this, slowly getting more eccentric as the days went by, but I am a bit 'weird' on any normal day so people thought it was just a phase I was going through. I was a heavy abuser of many different types of classical and designer psychedelics, stimulants, and cannabis, which I feel heavily contributed to the severity of this particular episode. I woke up Sunday morning and was receiving special messages from the TV news, from the radio, from music that I would listen to. I was way, way far out there on another planet. I had many delusions, mainly that I was the reincarnation of the apostle Luke, but I also thought that I might possibly be Jesus, the President of the USA, and an FBI agent at times. I am not religious, but was raised a Roman Catholic. Fixation on religious iconography, mythology, and spirituality were prominent features of my manic/psychotic episode.

I easily could have died, but thanks to random happenstance (a miracle?) I managed to have kind people (and not so kind people) help me to get to a hospital, then an inpatient mental hospital, for treatment. I am very lucky to still be here, and not just from this incident. I have come so close to death on many other occasions.

My family, friends, and my girlfriend at the time were under the assumption that I was dead for several days, as the police searched the lake but could not find my body (some of my clothing was found at the lake bed), and my body did not rise to the top after a certain amount of time (it was assumed that I had entered the lake and drowned. I had entered the lake, but I got back out again). I was presumed dead. I remember hearing a bird calling my name. I followed that bird for most of the day. I waded, swam, and floated through Farrington lake for a good part of that hot summer day. I was eventually picked up by a New Brunswick (North Brunswick?) police officer, who dropped me off at the New Brunswick train station with cut up, bloody feet and no shoes or socks, pockets full of mud, and soaked with water. He just left me there. A kind cab driver offered me a ride then insisted that I go to Robert Wood Johnson hospital. I eventually managed to get put into an inpatient mental hospital. The inpatient hospital contacted my family several days later to notify them that yes, I was actually alive. In a way, I did get to play Jesus for a while, what with the resurrection and all.

I have had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder since I was 17. I am now fast approaching 31 years of age, and I have now  been in full remission for over 4 years (This summer will be 5!). I have medical records out the ass and I am strongly considering putting together a rough manuscript of my story, my battle with bipolar disorder, being in and out of treatment (inpatient/outpatient) for going on 14 years), in hopes that I may somehow one day get it printed. I am one of the few who was committed to the adolescent state hospital Arthur Brisbane Child Treatment Center (due to poor care children have died there). Fortunately Arthur Brisbane was closed down many years ago. The place was a shithole.

(Here are two articles about the Arthur Brisbane Child Treatment Center:)

* http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/16/nyregion/inquiries-to-focus-on-conditions-at-child-centers.html

I have also been recently considering making bits and pieces of my story available online in the form of a podcast/MP3 download (I could do Youtube, but then I'd probably want to wear a mask, and I figure MP3 is more convenient for people to listen to whenever/wherever and I won't need a mask). Then again, Youtube has a HUGE audience. If I do get my story together it will take time to put together a manuscript and get my documents in order. I'd like to do this in the near future.

I haven't ever posted the news articles before, but in my long, long ago past user history here on Reddit there are bits and pieces of my story, mainly from this manic/psychotic episode of 2008. I now no longer user this username anywhere online apart from /r/bipolarreddit.

If any of you have any questions don't hesitate to ask. My story is an open book. I hope to go to more speaking events (already had one very successful one at an old day program I attended) in the future, and ideally I hope that NAMI will be interested in having me take part in their own speaker program. I feel very strongly that I should share my story with the world somehow, especially since I am one of the very few who is doing so well over the last several years.

Oh well, enough rambling on my part. I hope some of you find something in this post interesting.

Now it's gotten so bad that I can't use my stove. I left a burner on for a couple hours because I couldn't connect the steam and the whistle coming out of the tea pot with the fact that a burner was on. It took a friend trying to help me figure it out over the phone to get it turned off. I walk every day for exercise, but now I need to take someone with me because if I don't have someone I forget how I got to the trail, why I'm out there, and where I need to go to get home.

I was a full time student before I started meds, but now I'm a liability so I don't feel comfortable trying to work or return to school. I don't want to be working and unable to remember why I'm there or what I'm supposed to be working. I would hire most any other candidate over myself.

I've tried telling my doc about this problem but his response was that I'm just ""tired."" I'm too the point where I'm going to demand a med change, and if he still won't listen I'm debating taking my chances off meds again.

Whereas a few years ago I would kicked back and have enjoyed it too- if I was hypo/manic I would have thrown the damn party and been dancing on the table in the centre. 

Again, not usually a problem. It's just the very rare times like this- big parties, or holidays where there is a lot of drinking- where I really feel left out and bummed. 

There isn't really a solution here. Drinking can really spiral me down, it interferes with my drugs and drug taking schedule. I just can't do it anymore. And everyone else will do sometimes.

I've noticed a lot of posts from family members who deal with someone with Bipolar.  I'm on the opposite end of that, meaning my family has to deal with me.  My whole life I was not so med compliant, but after my son was born I made a promise to find meds that worked and stay on them.  Sadly, I still can't find a good med combo.

There are times my depression or mania gets so bad my mom has to take care of my son for a few days, sometimes a week or two.  When I'm depressed I don't get off the couch.  My son will come ask me to play with him and I end up saying ""I'm too tired.""  Even when I'm not depressed I have a very low energy level and can't do a lot without getting exhausted.

I love my son more than anything.  I would do anything in the world to make him happy.  A lot of times though, I feel like I'm failing him.  I hope that when he's older he'll look back and say ""I know my mom loves me"" and not ""I had to deal with all her ups and downs.""  Part of the problem is that he goes to a nice private school filled with stay at home super moms.  Compared to them, I just can't compete.  I know I shouldn't compare myself to people who don't have an illness weighing them down, but I can't help it.  

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else on here has kids and feels this way.  Am I being too hard on myself or am I destined to ruin my son's life?  I feel like my son is the one good thing that's come from my life and I just don't wanna mess him up.",,False,,t5_2qzru,False,,,True,t3_1751e1,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1751e1/any_bipolar_parents/,

""Much as one can try, it is impossible to make sense out of nonsense. You are not responsible for her illness, her medical care or her personal decisions. Bipolars are famous for living for the moment only - even if that is literally seconds. They can't think like others because their brain chemistry is so skewed. 
Don't doubt you were good to her. If she were someone who could have benefited from all that you had to offer, she would have. Instead she chose to make a series of decisions that are not based on common sense or clarity of thought. 
She is not necessarily a bad person; she is a person with a mental illness, and this is an illness that has many victims. You have been a victim long enough. You have cared for some and tried to do the right thing. As hard as it is now, you have had to deal with one of more difficult lessons in life. There are people who truly do think only of the themselves, and she is one of them.
She thinks of herself in the moment and what works for her in the moment. Bipolars are definately survivors because they drain others of time, money, emotion, and health. Loving them is not enough to make them better. 
The person who is best for you is out there, and she will be kind, intelligent, compassionate, and consider you in all she does. Be patient.""

First, I didn't go into it impulsively; I'd been deliberating on the idea for a solid decade, and had been settled on the location for years but just didn't know what it should say.  

2012 has been an incredible year for me, with a good deal of personal transformation.  I overcame a few longstanding personal hangups, stopped worrying as much about what others thought of me, stopped beating myself up quite so much over every little failure, started taking better care of my body, and became more physically active.  Outdoor sports were pretty central to this whole process, and have helped me to improve my fitness and my mood control.  I've also spent more of this year on the manic side of things than ever before- although I've gotten a lot better at channeling it into healthier avenues of expression; more running, physical activity, and cleaning, less self-destruction.  

I have really embraced the Jekyll and Hyde/Hulk metaphors, and specifically I started to think of ""manic me"" and ""depressed me"" as two distinct characters.  Not that I want them to be, but in many ways, they are; and ""manic me"" is the one I consider to be my true self. Even though Manic Me sometimes does regrettable things (hence the username), he at least *does things.* Which got me thinking- how would Manic Me communicate with Depressed Me?  After all, the two are never in the room at the same time.  

Well, I guess I'd have to leave a note or something.  

So I did.

My forearm now says, ""Semper progredere.""  It looks to anyone else like an ordinary slogan.  Maybe it represents some organization I was a part of?  Maybe.  They can think whatever they want.  But I know what it says.  Even Depressed Me knows what it means.  And when he sees it, out of the corner of his eye, he will be forced to think about it, and maybe even follow the instructions.  

It says ""Always keep moving forward.""  

Loosely interpreted, it means keep marching on.  Find some progress to make and make it.  

It's a message from Manic Me to Depressed Me.  It's *the* message that Depressed Me needs to hear, and it's written somewhere Depressed Me is likely to encounter it.  

Oh, [picture.](http://www.imgur.com/LiZ4F)

Also, thanks go out to Kritio, who helped me confirm that the words make sense and don't inadvertently refer to something embarrassing.  (One of my earlier ideas apparently referred to a dairy product due to a simple conjugation error.)

I'm 18. Growing up, I had a wonderful childhood. No traumatic events, stable family environment, good creative outlets - I was very hypersensitive, but luckily I was never exposed to anything that really messed me up. When I was 12 I started to sense something was wrong. I'm an extremely introspective person and am always aware of myself. I know when something is wrong - but this thing that got inside my head made me very self-deprecating. My mood fluctuations, my constantly shifting senses of self-worth, my growing confusion, I attributed it all to puberty.

For 6 years this thing grew inexorably. My sense of self-image was distorted. I was absolutely convinced *everybody* loved me one day, and then *everybody* hated me the next. My moods started to rocket all over the place, but there was no real consistency - they'd fluctuate within a week, then be normal, then be bad again. It was primarily depression, but there was a few brilliant moments of what I can only describe as hypomania. Every time I started to think something was wrong this evil little voice in my head, this thing that hated me in its entirety, would just kick me to the ground telling me what a shit I was for thinking something was wrong. It told me I was an attention-getter, it hounded me for feeling worried about myself when I had the best life.

Then shit got really intense for about a year, from between 17 and 18. On the outside, my life was improving - I was getting great grades, I had a great group of friends, I was really coming into myself. But on the inside shit started to break. I can only describe it as having a sharp metal screwdriver shoved into my sternum 80% of the time. At times I was brilliantly happy, and philosophical, and life was *beautiful*. At other times I'd have to escape to my car or bathroom to scream and bang my head against a wall, or I'd fall into fits of paranoia and seize up because I was *convinced* the world was too big to be real, and that I must just be a part of an experiment. I didn't understand where my emotions were coming from. They were so powerful but I couldn't attach them to anything.

Then one night I had what I can only describe as a visual hallucination (I had a couple more minor ones afterwards but none of them were auditory, there was no command element to them... just very unsettling). That's when I decided to start seeing a therapist. I saw a couple, actually. Even though I thought about death all the time, I was not suicidal; at that point in my life I was more spiritual than I have ever been. Part of my brain remained firmly rooted in rationality and it never let me do anything stupid. For that reason, the shrinks didn't pressure me about seeing a psychiatrist, even though they highly recommended it. I think they realized that I was waiting for another scary thing - another hallucination, or manic episode - to happen before I finally motivated myself...

Then one day it disappeared. I literally woke up in early December and it was gone. Nothing in my life had changed. There was no great epiphany, there was no momentous event. It was like a channel in my brain was now blocked. All my bad emotions and paranoia went away... along with the amazing beauty that came with it. Now it's 5 months later and I'm ""normal."" The colors of life seem duller, this ethereal sense of meaning that made the pain almost worthwhile just disappeared - I felt like I had this beautiful, astounding gift that I took for granted because I was so preoccupied with the pain and paranoia. Now it's gone and I can't get it back, but I am finally functioning like a real human being and not terrified of myself. I'm really confused - what happened? Is this possible? Can my brain just change overnight?

It is troubling because I never got an evaluation from a psychiatrist. I stopped talking to my shrinks since there was nothing to talk about (they all told me to call them first thing if I ever feel like it ""came back). I don't know if this is normal, if it will stay way forever, what I'm supposed to do... can somebody shed some light?

tl;dr
Had serious, ostensibly chemical-based emotional disturbances that just went away one day. They've been gone for 5 months. Can this happen?

I actually physically freeze up and just sit there for hours at a time. I admitted for the first time to others that I wasn't feeling well mentally, spoke with all of my professors who were amazingly understanding, and took a week off from school to seek help.

During this off week, I spoke with my parents who encouraged me to speak to a psychiatrist. When I spoke with the psychiatrist, she tried to prescribe me something to prevent me from freezing up with paralyzing thoughts, but I refused to take the prescription. I only get my depressive episodes later in the evening when I look back on the day and regret not accomplishing more, but I spoke to the psychiatrist in the morning and was feeling great, and I didn't believe I needed medication. After all, I have successfully made it through 7 stressful semesters without medication, why should this semester be any different?

Now it is the nighttime and I feel terrible again knowing that I still have a ton of schoolwork to do, I still get these episodes, and I turned down medication that could be helping me.

At the core of this issue is my anti-medication stance. As I said before, I have made it through 7 semesters of comparable stress levels, so why can't I just figure out how to get through this one? Also, I haven't given up my dream of potentially becoming an astronaut, and one of the requirements is a sound mental history. I don't think having a prescription for dealing with stress would look very good. Maybe I have actually accepted that I might be better off on medication, but just want to hear strangers on reddit tell me that I should put away my preconceived notion that relying on medication somehow makes you a weaker person, just so I don't have to take ownership for the decision.

Since I only get these episodes in the evening, how do I seek help during the days when I feel fine? People don't necessarily believe that I'm not doing well because I am in such good spirits. Also, I'm posting in bipolarreddit because I suspect that these are probably symptoms of bipolar disorder, but I have not been diagnosed and am trying to be cautious not to self-diagnose.",,False,,t5_2qzru,False,,,True,t3_r0j9p,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/r0j9p/i_responsibly_took_a_week_off_from_school_to_seek/,

But I have good news...it can be better.  I'm not cured, but I know that I am on the right path now just as surely as I was convinced that my life was a hopeless waste just a few months ago.

Back in the truly sick days, I would spend time seeking answers to the misery and I couldn't find them.  Now I know why, and I want to share what I've learned just in case somebody out there is looking.

Here is what helped:

#1

The single most important thing to your recovery is finding skilled, trusted mental health professionals.  You'll know them when you see them, and you probably already have a good idea how rare they are.  I  spent the better part of 5 years denying that they even existed, and it cost me 5 years plus every relationship I had plus every thing that I owned (including 2 houses).

If you think the helping professionals that are working with you suck, look elsewhere.  If you aren't sure whether they suck or not, look elsewhere.  If you don't have insurance or resources (I didn't) then you need to beg, borrow, steal, lie, cheat...whatever it takes.  It probably takes less than you believe, but even if it takes more find these people.  This is a fight for your life, and the right people on your side are the only way you have a chance.

For the record, I found mine in a tiny little hospital in the middle of a cornfield in a dying town.  If they exist here, they exist everywhere.

#2

Listen to these trusted professionals...they have real wisdom that will change your life in unbelievably good ways.  If your impulse is to resist what they have to say, fight the impulse.  If they tell you that the sky is green (they won't), believe them.  If they tell you that you have seven heads (they won't) believe them.  Once you decide they are trustworthy, invest your entire existence in believing what they have to say.

#3

You might need medicine.  They'll tell you.  You might need specific kinds of treatments or therapies.  They'll tell you.  Listen to it all very carefully, but listen especially for these words 

""You are accountable for your own thoughts and feelings"" 

and 

""Choose the thoughts that you attend to carefully"".

Treatment can take may forms, but I've come to realize that none of the forms could help me until I took those words to heart.  I had heard them in lots of forms all the way through the worst of my illness, but I never took them to heart and I paid a price for that.

The truth is, I struggle with accountability and make bad choices about what to attend to every day.  It still causes me to suffer.  The struggle gets a little easier each time that I remind myself of my 3 rules, and a little easier each day that I live with them.

I've never struggled for anything more valuable, and I never felt like I had any allies until I learned these three things.  There really is nothing more valuable than my life, and that is what the struggle is for.

Obviously, this is just one (still sick) guy's perspective.  It may not be the same for you.

How does everyone feel about this restriction? I don't think that it's fair because it seems to assume that all people who have a mental illness are dangerous or ill at all times. It's a common misconception that people who have a mental illness are violent and dangerous: [Here's a Harvard University Press article with more on that](http://harvardpress.typepad.com/hup_publicity/2011/02/misconceptions-madness-mayhem-what-is-mental-illness.html). People with a mental illness aren't always ill, either. If you take your medications and stay in treatment you can be fully functional and no one would even know you have a mental illness. I have been in remission (total absence of all bipolar symptoms) for going on four years now.

Is it right to deny me entrance to China because I have bipolar type I, even though you would never be able to tell in person unless I decided to tell you? What danger do I present?

How does everyone else feel about this?

    I was recently diagnosed Bipolar II and had a question regarding substance abuse (alcohol/marijuana) before my diagnosis and start of medication. Before I began taking my medication, I drank and smoked marijuana almost habitually. When drinking, I would black out many times, and with marijuana, I would smoke as often as possible to get out of my head.
    Due to this evidence, I was told I was an alcoholic/addict. I began attending 12 step meetings and talking to other sober people. Problem was, all of the people in the meeting told me if I would stop drinking/using, my life would get better. It didn't. I entered a deep depression and almost took my own life.
     With all of that said, I was recently diagnosed Bipolar and have been put on a mood stablilizer (Seroquel) and have hoestly been doing GREAT. I have drank alcohol on three separate occasions, all of which I had 2-3 drinks and then chose to stop, feeling I was ""buzzed enough"", a feeling tat is normally foreign to me. Ditto with the marijuana as well as compulsive chain smoking of cigarettes. My question is, is it possible for a Bipolar person to be misdiagnosed alcoholic/addict, when in reality t seems they were only self-medicating?

First, apologies for my frequent posting of late (even if I've been deleting them rapidly). It's been a rough few weeks and while I've suspected BPII for a while, this was the first time I was given that diagnosis.  I've had some crazy mixed states and (probably self-induced) mild psychosis.

I've been giving lots of thought to getting a dog lately, as I think it would help me immensely with my depression (BPII).  

That being said, I'm very concerned about my ability to care for it.  I've been feeling more and more violent of late, and that concerns me.  I have also been diagnosed as obsessive-compulsive, so I realize that part of my worries may be unfounded and self-made, but I still want your input.

Basically that means that the ski lifts aren't running, so we have to hike up a few thousand feet in elevation to be able to snowboard down. It took us a very exhausting hour to hike up the mountain to the spot we wanted, but it's only about a 7 minute ride down from there.

Was it worth it? Yes. At the top I felt a sense of accomplishment that I haven't experienced in quite some time. The seven minutes of bliss afterwards was just icing on the cake.

Here's to my psychiatrist for the Saphris that finally allowed me to feel something other than horrible for the first time in months. *Huzzah!*

I think many of the most known cult leaders were bipolar. They truly believed they were divine prophets and persuaded others to believe the same at first. Sex and shame always played a big role and many turned to drugs as well...

I know if I didn't get treatment and was brought up in a religious environment I could have become a cult leader. At the least, a fanatic fundamentalist in constant internal conflict.

Her husband had broken one of his step-daughter's arms. I live in New York, and I'm not rich enough to travel down there on violent whims, or make bail. I have a lot of love, for both her and her children, and seeing or hearing of them coming to harm is abhorrent. So that's the set up to my day.

As I was leaving work to grab some lunch, I saw a father walking from a bus stop. He was wearing a white, red, black winter jacket. He was yelling at his daughter, sitting in a stroller. She was dressed in purple, I think. She was crying. She didn't want to wear her hat. As we walked past each other, the only ones on the sidewalk, he told her ""FINE! Don't wear the fucking hat! GET SICK!""

I realize that being a parent is difficult, and I normally don't get involved, so I said nothing and kept walking even though I thought he was an utter asshole.

As I got to my vehicle and started to get inside, I turned and saw him, my windshield and a chain-link fence between us, as he leaned down and shouted some more into her ear, then struck her on the head. 

Something welled up inside me and I shouted so loud that my voice is still hoarse: ""HEY ASSHOLE! LET'S SEE YOU HIT THAT KID AGAIN!"" To which he turned and replied ""Hey, this is my kid."" To which I responded: ""I DON'T GIVE A FUCK! THERE'S A COP PARKED RIGHT OVER THERE, AND THERE'S A CAMERA RIGHT THERE!"" and I pointed down the street to the empty police SUV and across the intersection from him to the police camera mounted on a pole. 

He walked off with her without further provocation, and I let him, but I got into my Jeep and I drove off, and I broke down and started crying in the middle of an intersection. I made it through the turn and had to pull over because I started bawling so fucking hard.

You're the only group of people I know that have even half a chance at knowing how close I came to the edge in that moment, and even though you couldn't be there for me, or for her, or for her...

I spent yesterday night at a concert for a band I love and the whole time I was just trying not to burst out crying in front of my friends and everyone else there because my brain was being so relentless in picking me apart.

I don't know what she wants or why she decided to start talking to me again, but my ex started hitting me up over the past few days. I think things seemed to be going very well as we were starting to connect again. But I kept hitting roadblocks, and when I explained them to a friend, he instantly came up with all these ways I could have avoided putting myself in the problematic situations in the first place. I just kept feeling so stupid that I didn't have this knowledge that so many other people picked up on; I guess this is what I could have learned if I wasn't busy destroying myself with drugs for three years before diagnosis. My friend even invited me to come out with him a few nights so he could set me up and teach me some tricks but that frightens me more than I can describe; I am afraid to be in an unfamiliar environment with unfamiliar people having to constantly put myself out there and constantly face rejection while everyone else there actually knows what they are doing and has confidence.

Now she stopped contacting me because I fucked things up. I just starting revealing personal details at an all too inappropriate time and part of me feels like I subconsciously did it on purpose, that I sabotaged myself. But I don't know why I did it because I just don't want to be alone anymore. She actually understands me and I decided to fuck it up and drive her away. 

I'm sick of rejection and failure. I actually had the courage to ask this girl on a date in December and she didn't even respond. I felt so stupid and looking back at what I said it was completely fucking stupid. I can see why she didn't respond. I wish I could actually think for two seconds before I opened my mouth, maybe then I could actually do something right. But it is just a constant stream of rejection after rejection after rejection, hell I didn't even have to get to that point this time because I fucked it up before I had that chance.

I'm sick of this shit, I just can't deal with it anymore. What the hell is wrong with me? Ever since middle school I have been almost constantly rejected. I used to be optimistic and could just shake things off, but several humiliating rejections have just ruined me. I give up. I'm broken and defective. I'm too emotionally immature to handle relationships in real life. I'm too damn sick of being hurt and hurting myself and waiting months for emotional scars to heal, only for them to randomly pop up again. How did I become so pathetic? Why the fuck am I so weak and emotionally unstable? Everyone else can brush off rejection and handle their shit, why am I such a miserable piece of shit? I'm still too afraid to approach people thanks to that fear of rejection. It seeps into other aspects of my lives and is slowly eating away at me. It's a never ending cycle of failure and pain and misery, why am I so fucked up emotionally?

All my friends are getting into relationships and enjoying themselves. I haven't even met someone I could potentially date since my ex and I broke up in August because I have been too fucking afraid to even try. Why am I so alienated and isolated from everyone else my age? University has just been overworking myself and fear of failure and the even worse fear that another breakdown could be right around the corner. I've missed out on so much and I can't even meet people. For all my intelligence I can't figure out any of this. I'm sick of watching my roommate bring women home and then listening to them fuck while I lie in bed alone knowing it's going to be that way for a long time. Why am I so fucking stupid? What is so repulsive about me? I thought I was a good person but apparently no one can see that. Am I just inherently unlovable or did I do this to myself by being such an emotional cripple?  

I just don't want to be alone. I've been dealing with this for years and it seems like that can't change. I am sick of being taken advantage of. I'm just sick of everything. WHY THE FUCK CAN'T I BE A FUCKING NORMAL HUMAN BEING?????

I don't know what the point of writing this was supposed to be. This has always been a painful point for me and yesterday just brought it right to the surface. I was too upset to make it to my classes today, I'm an emotional trainwreck right now and things keep piling on. I also had to save one of my friends from a heroin overdose yesterday and while I am glad I know how to do that, it brings up a lot of memories of the past that I want to leave behind so badly. And it's fucking frightening for those few minutes, especially because it's a friend, and I have no medical equipment or anything. I just can't get a fucking break. Everything keeps piling on, why does this have to happen to me? Don't I already have enough shit to deal with?

I'm scared to bring a lot of this up with my therapist too, but I know I need to. I meet with her tomorrow so I don't have much time to get my shit in order but I really need to because this is tearing me apart. Someone pointed out I am in a feedback loop and I just can't escape. Fuck this shit.

http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/125ol6/update_day_57_its_a_happy_day/

As a quick summary, my wife has been diagnosed with bipolar w/ psychotic tendencies. She spent six weeks in the hospital suffering from a delusion that a former coworker had been masterminding her life for the past twenty years, that she was a princess, and that he was coming to take her away.

I was going to give an update last weekend, but decided to wait until this evening. 

How are things going?  Well, there have been ups and downs.  We've had a lot of talks about where we are at right now, and she is seeming to be fairly close to her normal (from an external perspective).  She is still fixated on the former coworker.  She tracked down where he worked now (damn LinkedIn!) and wrote a letter and sent it to him.

She actually asked me to read the letter to make sure it didn't sound 'too stalkery'.  In it, she basically talked about how they used to work together, updated him on her life, and said that she'd love to meet up for coffee some time 'as a friend'.

The letter certainly had some assumptions in there that would confuse him.  She talked about how she saw him at a hospital (which I believe to be part of the delusion, but there is no objective evidence one way or the other.), and how she was sorry she hadn't talked to him there.

We've had talks about where we are at.  Her statements are that her head says she should stay with me, but her heart doesn't.  She is convinced that there is no 'wow' factor between us, and questions whether there ever was. 

And when we are talking about the future, she only seems to see two choices, leaving me and the girls to try to be happy, or staying with the status quo.  She does not seem to recognize the possibility that if the connection between us has been lost that we could work at it to rebuild it.

But, she is being consistent in her statements that she won't be making any major decisions until July.

She has talked to me about moving to the West coast from the centre of the country.  In her mind, it is still seems like a fairly easy thing to do.  I could quit my job, and would certainly be able to find one over there without a problem.

I've explained to her that there is no way I am even willing to talk about moving until we have decided about our relationship.  She seemed to think it would be a good idea to move over there 'as room-mates', and share a place.  Strangely enough, this would put her geographically close to the former coworker....  

I also told her that right now my focus is on trying to restore our relationship.  But, if she ends up deciding that the relationship is dead and can't be saved, my focus will change to doing what's best for me and the girls, and that may not include her living with us as room-mate.

On Saturday we had a discussion where I explained my fears to her.  That we would move there, get a place, and then she would leave to be with her boy-toy.  I would be stuck in a lease on a place I couldn't afford on one income, and that with the added hours I'd need to work, I wouldn't be able to take care of the girls, so would lose them too.

Her response was she was afraid that if we split before moving, that maybe the girls and I wouldn't move if she wanted to go to the coast.

I got a kick out of it when she spouted out one day that she didn't see why she had to be the one to move out and find a new place if she left.  My response was, quite simply, that she's the one who wants to leave...

But, she is trying to work things out, and trying to figure out what she wants. 

Today we had our first couple's counselling session (a month or so ago she wasn't interested in the idea as it would be a waste of time).  I have no idea if this is going to help or not, but I figure worst case is that it will stall her for a month or two while we go through the process.  And maybe it will help her work through what she wants and give us tools to use in the future.  As well, her psychiatrist is going to be recommending a psychologist for us to talk to together.

One thing that was quite remarkable that she mentioned last night is that she sometimes still feels like she's getting better.  I encouraged her, and told her that I was still seeing changes for the better almost every day.  And its true.  She is now taking a more active role in the house, noticing more things, and starting to be concerned with more things than just herself.

There is still a lot of room for improvement, but there is still slow and steady improvement.  And tonight I got an interesting comment from her.    

Right now, according to her, we are good friends, but the thought of anything physical between us - even holding hands - disgusts her. We were talking this evening after the girls were in bed, and she said that she wished she was still attracted to me, and that we had a connection.

This is possibly the first time that I've heard her say that since her hospitalization, and its giving me a bit more hope.  Unfortunately, she has not given her psychiatrist permission to discuss her case with me, so I don't have any objective statement on how things are going.  

However, the doc has stopped her Lorazepam, but still has her at 20mg of Olanzapine.  To me, that is telling me that since he hasn't moved her to a maintenance dosage, he must still be shooting for improvements.

On and off meds, in and out of therapists, since I was about 16. I'm 28 now. I'd never actually attempted suicide until last January. I overdosed and ended up in a mental hospital for almost two weeks.
 

After I got out, I was seeing counselors and taking meds regularly. Before the hospital I was severely addicted to pot (yes it is addictive!) and ended up in substance abuse counseling as well. A few months ago I started smoking again here and there. Now it's back to every day if I can get away with it. I've started stealing it from people, too, which is something I've never done before.


I stopped going to my one counselor. It sucks because she was actually helping in a lot of ways. I got really sick, and missed a couple of appointments, and she hasn't returned any of my calls. I guess I don't have a counselor anymore. I stopped taking my meds too, after months of side effects and changes and sickness. I got out of the habit and can't seem to get myself back in it again.


Everyone thinks I'm doing so much better but truthfully I'm not. Not even close. I've been diagnosed as Bipolar types 1 &amp; 2, and also BPD. I feel like I'm drowning and I don't know what to do. I don't want to end up back in the hospital but sometimes I feel like that's the only thing that might help.

The last 48 hours have been a complete mind fuck and I feel like a switch has been flipped.
Yes, work's been busy and I've been stressing but yesterday I couldn't get though it.  I sat at my desk with a list of things that needed doing and I didn't do them.  I got up every couple of minutes, walked around, made coffees, added to my list.  Plugged my earphones in and tried to stop the twitching of my butt on that seat and get stuck into some price lists.

Went home unsatisfied, ate lollies, stayed up to some stupid hour planning to finish some work as needed to have a meeting next day so I could send our guy in to our buyer with all the info he needed.

Woke up, snoozed alarm for 10min and that was it. I could not get up.  I don't really know why, I can't remember.  I just didn't want to go and spend another day like yesterday.  I got up 3 hours late, called boss with some bullshit about doc appointment that ran late, I'd be there in 40 min.  Next thing I know I'm bawling my eyes out driving down a freeway singing to Brand New and just driving.

I drove out to some lovely tourist towns, had coffee, bought a dress, sunglasses and books.  I filled my tank one and a half times.  I dipped my feet in the ocean.

I talked myself out of stopping for (and drinking) the nicest bottle of wine I could find - prime wine country all around there.

I am at mums house now, I need someone to fix shit for me :( I bailed on a meeting, I never told them I'd be in, I haven't responded to any messages from friends and I'm trying really really hard not to send any dirty texts to anyone.

Doctor tomorrow.  I can't tell mum about the 7 hour drive, I'll lose my car.  I also can't tell her about lying about being on birth control when having sex with some poor unsuspecting young soul the other weekend.  Or the times before that.

Or the poor boy I seem to have sucked into this black hole - night we met I slept with him, after asking if I could pretty please come to the strip club with him in a car with 3 random guys I don't know.
I've stayed away from the drugs, but goddamn it is lucky I haven't been submitting my time sheets and I have my savings in an account I can't access at the moment.  I'd be on the other side of the country in some hotel right now.

This is a throwaway, because I don’t really know how the community will receive me. I am 17 years old, 18 in November, and I know I’ve been a little different since I was about 14 or 15. I’d go through these cycles, and every few weeks it was as if I were a different person. When I was depressive, I’d have suicidal thoughts, as many of us do, and when I was manic, I was ridiculed for being so hypersensitive to everything. 

When I was 15, someone very special to me came into my life. He was my best friend for 2 years, and we stuck together through all of my cycles, and through all of his. We seemed to be on opposite schedules, which is kind of funny in retrospect, but we were both very obviously bipolar. For lack of support, we clung onto each other. As our relationship became more and more destructive, the harder it would be for us to separate. When I was manic, I’d realize that I couldn’t talk to him anymore, because he made things worse. When I was depressive, I’d always come crawling back. 

Now, he’s going away to college, and I’m feeling that sickening urge to contact the one person I’ve ever felt loved me, even though any kind of relationship with him ends with me crying, shaking on the ground every night. I feel like I need him. I know this obsessive behavior is beyond unhealthy, but I can’t help it. 

I never thought I’d be bipolar, but now that I reflect, I’ve come to realize that my mother has always been bipolar too. She’s be happy and productive one week, and the next she’d hit me for crying, followed by apologies the next week, and more verbal abuse after that. Unfortunately, I’m 17, and my family is convinced that mental illness is invented by big pharma. 

It wasn’t until my general doctor suggested finding a psychiatrist and looking into bipolar, that I even considered what was wrong with me anything more than crippling depression and severe anxiety. But I know people with depression, and I know people with anxiety, and it’s nothing compared to this horrible beast I feel inside of me whenever something strikes me wrong. 

After visiting a clinic and being diagnosed with Bipolar II, at least I had a name to pin to all of this.

My mother always told me she called the psychiatrist to try and get an appointment, but they never called back because I “wasn’t bad enough to see”. That made me feel the worse. I wanted to die, and no one would even help me. Not even for money. It wasn’t until I found all of the psychiatrist referrals waiting to go in the shredder, that I realized it wasn’t me. 

I’ve waited so long to get this off my back to someone I feel could actually understand me. I feel so helpless and trapped and burdened by what I am, I can barely see when I want to be. I have so many plans for myself, but everything seems like such a huge hurdle when seeing the size of an application makes me burst into tears or clear a table. I can’t deal with being two different people, but you guys know how it feels.  

I guess I’m asking for advice, some guidance maybe? What is one thing you wish you knew about handling bipolar when you were first diagnosed?

**EDIT**: Thank you everyone for your kind words and advice, I'm really touched that all of you had such nice and helpful things to say. I'd like to post a little more informations for everyone though.

Yes, I am going to community college starting in August. I got into a 4-year university, but my unsupportive and possessive mother wouldn't let me go. I was so overwhelmed by the prospect of financing the whole ordeal, I gave up. I didn't know where to look, where to start, and absolutely no one in my life wanted to help me. I couldn't even figure out where on Reddit to turn to for help financing college. The whole process is like a mountain of bureaucratic crap that I could not navigate, my chest is getting tight thinking about it. 

Bipolar disorder runs in my family, yes. All of them though, think that they're the only ones who are bipolar, so they deserve special treatment. They refuse to acknowledge that maybe I don't get along with them sometimes because I'm bipolar too. This is also how my friend is about my bipolar. He thinks his is more important, so I should have a panic attack because it inconveniences him. 

Regardless, my friend has grown a lot, he's still a bipolar sociopath, but I really care about him, even if it's difficult for him to return the favor. He's also my only channel that understands me. He's the only other openly bipolar person I know, and he's the only person that will listen to me talk about what I had for breakfast as well as pat me on the back when I'm in hysterics because the push pin wouldn't go into my wall correctly.

I'm really glad that I found this community, and I dont have the courage to not use a throwaway just yet.

As a daily user of marijuana, and used to taking mushroom trips alone, I had sort of shattered my mind and sense of self into fragments. I suffered auditory hallucinations and the worst part is that I believed them, leading me to say and do things that I utterly regret.

After the police was called to my house and I was led away in handcuffs to the hospital, bloody and injured from a confrontation with my dad and my second oldest brother (the fault was mine, even though I was later diagnosed to be bipolar type II with schizoaffective disorder, since I believed what the voices were saying).

I stayed in there for a month and a half peacefully, after I had tried to escape once and ended up being locked down and sedated, just like in the movies.

I still wasn't mentally healthy. I still believed what the voices were saying but kept that to myself, and let everyone else believe that I was back to normal. I played along and acted like the victim they thought me to be (I don't think that you're a victim if you let your disorder hurt other people).

I was released back home and haven't returned to the psych ward since. My prescription was fairly standard - Seroquel, an anti-psychotic, and Cipralex, an anti-depressant.

After a month or two, I secretly stopped taking the meds, believing that I was not bipolar and that the voices were still real, coming from other people who could somehow read my mind and were trying to control me. I found a way to obtain marijuana again, and I was working at the time (at the same job as I am now, fortunately) so I was able to fund my own habit. But my parents eventually found out.

I treated people like shit, since I believed that everyone else was out to get me, and that doing marijuana and shrooms again would help me find what I was looking for - answers.

Well, I crashed my brother's car one night. And that was it. My family had had enough. I was going back to the same shit that had caused my illness in the first place, and goddammit, they weren't going to see me kill myself mentally under their roof.

I had some savings, and went back to the town where I had been going to university. I took a break from school for the semester of September to December 2011. I rented a room in a house with several other random students, and paid 375 a month. The majority of my money went towards weed and alcohol.

I later brought my guitars and amps down with me. I'd like to say that it was music that saved me, but I suspect that it is a human thing to wish it be known that a dream saved you instead of the actions of others.

After a girl I had loved saw me manic, and my mental state was made very obvious by how I acted while high on anything, she cut off all contact. And that was it. I had a plan, half-baked, to win her back when I finally decided to sober up for good and make music a sustainable career; to finally re-enter society and stop listening to the voices in my head which I fully acknowledged as auditory hallucinations for the first time.

It didn't work out that way though. How could it? People rarely change.

I had a hope though, and it has never died, that someday she would find me again and see that I've finally pulled myself out from my own hell and am contributing to society, helping to make the world a better place in my own way and as a human being worth admiring.

Friends, I am glad to tell you, that from my personal experience, it is in all of us to make life better for ourselves, and to bring real happiness to the ones you care about. 

I stopped all drug use, including alcohol, in November. I started to refocus on getting into bands and improving my playing to the point that I could be considered as professional and as a serious threat to others trying to make it.

Until the start of January, I suffered trouble sleeping. I had aches in my brain that woke me up from my sleep! I felt the brain damage that is caused by cycling. I had to accept that I indeed have bipolar disorder, and I was in a mentally dark place that only I could find my way out of. It was time to stop blaming others, and to stop lying down on my back, only to find a sky that would always be there.

There is a song lyric that recently has struck a chord with me - ""Keep moving, don't look back"", written by a band called Kylesa (they have two drummers and are from Savannah, Georgia). I've found a sincere love for heavy, chaotic music still dormant within me.

It has been six months now, and I am mentally in a place where I can proudly say my recovery is permanent.

Yet I still falter sometimes, and curse myself for not having raised myself from the dead sooner. You, the sufferer, and I have had this ability to do so the whole time.

This whole time, I have been fortunate enough in that the Seroquel and Cipralex were enough to push my disorder into remission. And more fortunate for me is that I have started to become the person I've always wanted to be and have seen from afar in the past.

I have watched several loves of my life come and go, because I idled too long in my empty drug use and unwillingness to accept who I truly was. I can never see them again. Some of you will understand why I remain silent on this matter. It had to be, and listen to me when I say, ""How so I resent this finality"".

I think that is all I have to say on the matter right now. But I wish all of you the best of luck with everything in the future.

For once my life was going great! I was doing well in school, pledging a sorority, making friends, being active, etc. and then one day, about a month ago, everything changed because of absolutely nothing.

The hallucinations I have been experiencing as long as I can remember worsened. And suddenly, for the second time in a year, I started losing my connection with reality. Instead of small things changing, my hallucinations became full-environment hallucinations. 

This fucked up everything. EVERYTHING. I would sit in my room, or really wherever I was, and desperately try to sort what was real and what wasn't. Often, when I figured out what was happening wasn't real and it stopped, I realized I wasn't acting like myself during these points. If that makes sense.

I stopped going to class, going to meetings, eating, sleeping, waking, moving, leaving my dorm room... I stopped doing anything. There would be days at a time where I would sit at my desk and just stare at the wall in front of me. And I wouldn't be aware of it. 

I would walk into a classroom occasionally, trying to take care of myself, and the next thing I knew I would be somewhere completely different. Sometimes I wasn't even sure where I was and often I had lost hours of time.

I'm terrified I'm schizoaffective. I'm very close with my great-uncle who has paranoid schizophrenia and I've seen what it has done to him and my family. I love him so much but I don't want to be that kind of burden on my family. I'm afraid that if I am diagnosed with this, I will kill myself. And if I tell anyone, I'll be re-hopspitalizied. That cannot happen.

This is kind of stream-of-consciousness. I'm sorry. 

And so I'm leaving my university for the second time in one academic year. Eight months of struggling, pushing, and working and no credits.

I'm still stuck here for at least two more days. 

What am I going to do at home?

I've been reading this Subreddit since last summer and it's helped me get a better understanding of bipolar just by hearing your stories.

It seems like people most often post here when they're struggling or at least in need of advice. That's understandable and I'd like to think that is what commenters are here for, but I think it misrepresents us as people in perpetual crisis (on either end of the spectrum). 

Simply put: I am feeling the best I can remember feeling without being manic. There is some sort of consistency and routine to my life. Not long ago I would not have believed this possible.

In retrospect, admitting myself to a psych ward and starting medications was one of the best decisions of my life. I'm writing this in a public place so I'm not going to cry, but just thinking over how dramatic these changes have been makes me tear up in a good way. I'm don't want to be unrealistically optimistic (a quality that has never been a problem), but I thinks Lamictal really really helped. It's not like it has not taken some personal discipline, but the meds put me in a position to accomplish what I want to.

What is the underlying motivation? Don't you think it's giving false information out, borerlining on straight up lying? I could even say its trolling. 

A lot of people think they are ""bipolar"" but aren't. You may be cyclothymic or something, ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder, you could be nothing, you could be anything but I feel until you are bipolar as determined by a professional, don't give yourself qualifications you don't have. You can be ""sure"" from ""research"" you've done and other people could have told you you're ""bipolar"" and you could ""fit the criteria"" but that's not how diagnostics work. If you *want* to see bipolar in yourself, well, you'll see it! 

**It could have reprecussions beyond what you intended.**

I find it insulting and degrading to be honest. This disease has ruined my life.

As for people who are posting as SOs and friends of people with bipolar asking questions, that's completely fine with me. 

HOOOOOKAY edits:

My solution is people who feel they may be bipolar but are undiagnosed should say ""i think i am bipolar and..."" instead of just ""i am bipolar"" when responding to posts. ADHD and BPD and schizophrenia (and arguably MDD) share traits with bipolar disorder. In case someone is mistaken in their feeling, acknowledging the tenatativeness is, to me, a sign of responsibility, magnamity, courage and respect. 

Also, if you are undiagnosed check out the top PSA. Nothing is more dangerous than someone who needs help but doesn' get it. If you are bipolar, which you very well may be (if you're one of the questioners) you should go for help because bipolar and suicide are connected, undoubtely. Just, suffering bipolar without help is not the way it has to be. 

I agree people who think they may be bipolar should reach out into this community, and many opnely do, declare they may be bipolar or bipolar pending. i think it's healthy, the pending bipolar posts, the i think i have bipolar and connect to this replies...that sits very well with me-i think it makes them more likely to reach out for support in the real world.

I don't think anyone here would be happy to know that we had a hand in someone's drinking, self-harming or suicide...because people are just that fragile and an angry pm could be all it takes.
I do think personal attacks on me are unwarranted and not progressive. Putting me down doesn't help you or me or the problem. Reddit is a sort of think tank. I admit I lost it, too. But from now on, **let's just disagree with ideas, not people**.

Also, **I got a PM urging me to kill myself and calling me a ""faggot""** let's not let this happen to eachother okay, never any pro injury, pro drug use, or pro suicide comments made in anger. if you're really having it balls out with someone, just...don't say things that we all know you wouldn't say in the real world to me if you could see me...i think everyone who got upset, including myself, are good people who got frustrated.

**Special Thanks to anyone and everyone who noticed I was posting in a bit of a hypomania and was out of control and acted to make people aware of this to protect me from being attacked...which was only escalating the hypomania.

I planned yesterday to take my cat to the vet and to take my broke ass to DFACS to apply for assistance... But I didn't do any of it. I laid back down in my bed, covered my head, hid away from the wind and cold outside, and slept. Of course, panic inducing nightmares waited for me and I finally felt too guilty to sleep anymore. Now I just want to cry. I wish I could sleep with no dreams. I don't want to go to my boyfriend's house or anywhere else. I don't want to go pick up the kids from school or listen to them argue later today. I just want to be left the Hell alone. And I wish I didn't feel guilty for it. I was great 2 days ago. I hate everything right now. I hate this disease that keeps me from functioning like a normal human. I hate myself for not having the strength to fight it right now. I hate feeling scared. I hate sleep and I hate being awake. I want to scream or pitch a fit, but that takes way too much energy. 

I was planning to start yoga classes and take a cake decorating class earlier this week. I woke up yesterday and realized what a stupid idea that was. Right now, I just want to throw in the towel.

I'm a student at the moment, but events in the last week have me wondering about my future. My drugs mean I'm not suicidal, I'm less likely to burn through my whole savings in two days, and can keep my sudden anger outbursts mostly in control.

However, as you guys probably know, the drugs aren't a cure-all (or at least mine aren't- maybe some of you have different takes).

I discovered this Reddit recently, and I am very happy I did so. I don't know many other people with the bipolar diagnosis in RL, so finding an active community on Reddit with whom I can discuss my experience, and hear the experiences of others, makes me very happy.

A bit of a tangent, and a bit of a preface:

I personally don't like to associate myself with the term ""bipolar disorder"", because, as we have all experienced, it carries unpleasant connotations. That is why I refer to my experience as part of a condition, or simply as my experience. I am not denying that I have a chemical imbalance of some type, and I am taking medications to help me exist comfortably in 'normal' society. I simply don't embrace the rest of what the 'disorder' implies. Personally, I've had many beautiful experiences with this condition, and I've learned a lot from the negative, so I disagree with people who treat my experience as a crippling illness that I will never recover from. 

As I said, I take medications, though I am very skeptical of our current medical model, and think it is offensively narrow-minded. I refuse to accept a label that, to me, places me in an almost sub-human category. Though I have made mistakes, and behaved in socially unacceptable ways (which I don't want to repeat), I will not distance myself from my mind and psyche. To do so would be denial. 

So, for my first post, I thought I would ask what being bipolar means to you in a more philosophical or metaphysical sense, as opposed to what medications you are taking and how they affect you, and the pressures of getting by in daily life (unless it is relevant to what the disorder MEANS to you).

I'm curious :)

What are your experiences using weed to self-medicate? Or just to manage your condition? Ultimately what I'm asking is, do you think that it's had a more positive or negative impact on helping you manage being bipolar?


For me, I think it's been more of a positive thing, but who knows, I could be wrong and the weed could even be the thing responsible for triggering manics. However, I personally use it to stabilize my mood. Since I'm always anxious, it helps me relax. Synonymous to someone having  a glass of wine after they home from work, except that I'd rather take a hit. I've also stopped drinking. For a number of reasons but mainly because I don't like myself on alcohol (only hard alcohol, I love a good beer with dinner) and because I just prefer weed and it's mellow loveliness. I adore it for helping me relax but I'm also afraid that I withdraw from social interactions because of it. I don't know... what are your experiences with it?

There are times when i really can't bring myself to leave the house. if i do i end up breaking down, usually crying in public, and am not comfortable again until i'm back at home. Sometimes it can be good to stay at home like a hermit, but i keep being told that if it goes too long, it's more harm than good.

So, i'm on day 5 of not leaving the house (my personal record is 17 days...a bit long, i know, but it did help)...i'll go out for a cig, but that's only if the neighbor upstairs isn't outside. if she is, i skip the cig. my main problem is i feel like there are people looking at me/observing when i go outside, and that makes me freak out. if there's no one in sight, i still feel like there's someone in a window somewhere, just watching what's going on here. i know it sounds like common paranoia, and part of it is, but there are also some legitimate reasons i believe this is happening.

anyways, i'm wondering what you do when you don't want to leave? how do you force yourself to go out? any tricks that help you manage your anxiety when you've made it outside amongst people? how long do you feel is 'ok' to be a hermit? any advice is greatly welcomed

**edit** i'm bipolar type 2 diagnosed at the age of 23, was first diagnosed as depressed at the age of 7 and major depressive disorder at 17. i didn't even realize i had ever had a (hypo-)manic episode until i was diagnosed, because the way i saw it before that was ""as long as i'm not depressed, it's good"". but now, i've seen that i was hypomanic quite a lot when i was younger, and definitely more so in the past 3 years (i'm 25), leading me into an utter and total burn-out 2 years ago (at which point i was diagnosed), followed by more ups and downs and ups agains than i can remember since i started taking meds. i feel kinda like the meds haven't stabilized me so much as made me aware of my moods. we are working on getting the right dosage, it's just frustrating that it's taking so long. that's partially why i would like to have non-medication solutions to my problems; so that i can get by a little better in the meantime, until my meds are working.

**edit again** wow, you guys are awesome! thank you so much for your responses so far! i am making myself go to bed now (1.30 am--i'm in europe, please don't ask where), and hope to get out of the house tomorrow to treat myself to a cappucino. please keep posting, any and all ideas and comments help! thanks a ton awesome people! see you tomorrow :-) good night!

**new edit** hey wonderful people, you all were so much help last night, i feel much stronger today! I just got home from a planned trip to the food store, but instead i went to the animal store and hung out there for a little bit. cuddly animals are wonderful therapy for me :-)  
after much thought, i've decided to talk to my doctors about the anti-psychotic meds as soon as possible, and will be able to tell him more about my symptoms (ie the hallucinations--identified with the help of VelocityGirl77), so i know that will help. i will also be following KingOfZalo's advice on how to handle the situations as they arise, he gave some great tips! and KiloKhan made a good point of being creative: if you're feeling depressed, create something depressing. it will be something to look back on, to see the progress you've made.

The people who have them had no idea what my Sister did, and I'm still trying to figure out how to handle this situation now.

----------------

I went on my first vacation in over a year, just a three day trip to the Sierra Nevada with my Uncle and his family in an area with no cell phone service (it was awesome to unplug). 

Upon getting in range of a cellphone tower on my way home I got a voicemail from my 33 year old Sister saying she gave my dogs away to an elderly couple in San Jose, California.

I've been paying my Sister $500 a month to take care of my two dogs and paying for health insurance for her (which is about $400 a month) since January. I moved to San Francisco for my business, and I'm working 12-16 hour days, and didn't want to have to make my dogs give up living in Southern California. They loved my Sister, and I thought she loved them.

I left them with my Sister trusting her to take care of them. A month ago she stole $700 from me, and hasn't spoken to me since. She kept accepting the payments to take care of the dogs so I figured she was just having an episode (I'm about 200% sure she is bipolar as well and I've been trying to get her to get help for over a year now, hence the insurance I've been paying for but she wont even get blood work done). 

Not a word since I got this voicemail informing me she gave the dogs away. She lied to my Brother and a few other family members claiming I didn't love them anymore and didn't care (I'm amazed no one contacted me to confirm this, she simply made it up). I would do anything for those dogs, they're family.
 
I never in a million years thought she was even capable of doing something like this without saying a word to me. In retrospect I should have never trusted her.

I've spoken to every member of my family, family friends, and we've all pleaded with her to tell her where my dogs are and she wont tell anyone.

I've talked to the police and they wont do anything. They claim I need to file a civil lawsuit.

I haven't eaten anything since 10am, and at this point I am not even sure what her motivations are. My mind is starting to race and wonder why she wont tell anyone where they are, I'm starting to wonder if maybe something bad happened to them and they're dead and this is all just some delusional mind game she's playing with everyone...

Just needed to vent. :-(

TLDR: Trusted my Sister to take care of my dogs, and she gave them away and wont tell anyone where they are.

P.S. If anyone has any ideas on how I can possibly try and get the word out or find them please let me know.",,False,,t5_2qzru,1373410652.0,,,True,t3_1hqh17,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1hqh17/my_sister_gave_away_my_dogs_and_is_refusing_to/,

Dear beloved coffee,

I write to you today to express my sincere appreciation and joy of having you in my life.  

I awake every morning a dead, self-loathing mistake. Regretfully, I trudge over to the kitchen, past the bathroom, where I'd prefer to drown than be out of bed. I'll glance over at the bathtub, imagining laying down and shooting my brains out, letting my head pour down the spout.

""Not today,"" I'll think.  

You begin life each morning with a gurgle and a sputter, your aroma a soft reminder of refuge from monotony and despair. Soon, I desperately engulf and consume you, and we are together.  
Gradually, the world changes. Dark turns to light, and I can feel the earth open up to cast aside flaw and embrace me. I am human again, I am happy to be here. I have the energy to live.

I drive to work. I start to speed. 85 isn't that fast on the freeway, right? Get out of my way! I'm important and reckless! Haha! I got to work ten minutes early! I'm the greatest!  
Hello boss, wow you're looking mighty fine today, we should go out for drinks sometime! Haha!

 *uh did I just hit on my boss?*

 haha!  

Completed all my work by 11:30! Reward myself with expensive shit from the internet! Buy buy buy!  

""Uh, lefthandedspatula, this change you made to the system seems risky and you didn't consult anyone before you did it.""  
Haha! He wouldn't understand. In a bout of genius, I found a way to save the company thousands! It's so simple! This will surely lead to my promotion!  

""I'd like to talk to you about this later.""

Lunch time! Expensive restaurant!

Speeding ticket! Oh well! He was such a nice officer! 

*dude, you can't keep doing this*

I'm alive! It's okay! 

*no it's not. You can't afford this shit, you rushed through that project, and you're being reckless*



Oh god, I'm a horrible person. I spent a week's worth of pay today. How will I pay my rent? 

I suffer through the rest of my work day. I don't know how I'm going to fix all this, and I've suddenly lost the energy to try. I'm back to square one: worthless, unmotivated, unproductive. But now I'm anxious. Maybe I should kill myself. I'd rather feel nothing at all than feel like this. But I can't even motivate myself to go through with it. I'm so useless that I can't even die. 

Barely eat, watch tv, cry, fall asleep.

As I sob into my pillow, I can smell the aroma of coffee from the empty mug on my desk.

I fall asleep, hoping I don't wake up, or by some miracle I'm granted with the strength to call a therapist.

I know coffee, you aren't the problem. Most of the time I'll be with you and be fine. Today was such a bad day, I'll do better tomorrow. Thanks for helping me get through the day.

Never wanted to or perhaps could  do the work to achieve…for instance gave up on wanting to play hockey when he realized that he would actually need to learn to skate! Also a very peculiar suspiciousness.

Couldn’t  follow very basic household rules ( go to school, don’t sell drugs, keep a very reasonable curfew) so after much family counselling help and even mediation, he  quit school and moved out at sixteen.

Next 6 years, drifted through temporary jobs, never had a real place to live until finally by last summer,ended up  living in parks, started using crystal meth and fell deep into deep into pychosis.  Had to call 911 and have him sectioned under the mental health act ( had no idea at the time what a totally exceptional experience we had with the police, they were terrific)

Second Hospitalization: December same year, full on pychosis, absolutely ordeal getting him admitted , he had a minor legal infraction (graffiti) so rather  than taking him to the hospital, the police took him to jail and then released him the next day with no assessment and no notice to us.  After three more days of struggle, finally got the right cops at the right time to bring him to the hospital… 3 week stay .

Third Hospitalization: January, only out of hospital 1 week, again seeking police help…turns out he had missed a hearing while in the hospital in December,  now has a warrant and is taken back to jail and again not accessed!  We turned up in court, and working with the court appointed lawyer, the crown prosecutor dropped all charges, he was accessed and taken to hospital.  Turns out he and another  patient had been doing crystal meth while in the hospital during the last visit so of course he ended up back so fast.

He continues to explain how this distinction is misguided and actually helps to perpetuate social stigmas around psychological disorders. Mental illnesses can include many physical symptoms (fatigue, loss of appetite...) and ""physical"" illnesses can also have psychological symptoms--the most common of which is pain (a purely psychological phenomenon). So they are actually very much tied together and it is not possible to fundamentally distinguish one from the other. 


**Here's where he starts relating this to public attitudes (if you don't read the article at least read this part):**

""Unfortunately, the linguistic distinction between mental and physical illnesses, and the mind/body distinction from which this was originally derived, still encourages many lay people, and some doctors and other health professionals, to assume that the two are fundamentally different. Both are apt to assume that developing a ‘mental illness’ is evidence of a certain lack of moral fibre and that, if they really tried, people with illnesses of this kind ought to be able to control their anxieties, their despondency and their strange preoccupations and ‘snap out of it’. It is true, of course, that most of us believe in ‘free will’; we believe that we ourselves and other people can exercise a certain amount of control over our feelings and behaviour. But there is no reason, justified either by logic or by medical understanding, why people suffering from, say, phobic anxiety or depression should be able to exert more control over their symptoms than those suffering from myxoedema or migraine. There is a further and equally damaging assumption that the symptoms of mental disorders are in some sense less ‘real’ than those of physical disorders with a tangible local pathology. As a result, people experiencing intense fatigue, or pain that is not accompanied by any obvious local lesion, are often dismayed or affronted by being told that they are suffering from neurasthenia, the chronic fatigue syndrome or ‘psychogenic’ pain, and interpret such diagnoses as implying that their doctor does not believe that they are really in pain or exhausted by the slightest effort, and is dismissing their complaints as ‘all in the mind’.""",,False,,t5_2qzru,False,,,True,t3_178ixf,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/178ixf/so_i_know_this_isnt_rpsychology_but_i_found_this/,

So, I was expecting last week to be tough as it was our 9th anniversary.  I had arranged a counselling session in the morning of our anniversary, the day she was coming home.  It was a great session, and when I left, the sun came out of the clouds, and I felt very positive.  The feeling has stayed with me, and I've been a lot more upbeat.

As I mentioned in the last post, I picked up a pottery vase and a boquet of fall coloured flowers for her (which I know is one of her favourites).  I intentionally avoided any type of flowers like roses.  I was expecting her to have a very negative reaction, since a few days prior, when I said I had picked up my wife at the hospital she had been visibly upset and had to leave the table.  

I gave her the flowers, told her they were from the girls and I, and that it was a welcome back and a happy anniversary.  She actually said she liked them, and thanked me.  I was blown away!

She went out with a support group to the theatre in the evening.  She was very anxious prior to leaving, about finding the place (she's been there lots of times in the past), whether she would find the car after the show, and whether she would meet her soul-mate there.  Of course I wasn't happy that she's still having thoughts about the guy, but I was very happy that its changed to being worried about seeing him rather than wanting to see him.  And, when she came home, she had had a great time with no issues.

I've told her that she is welcome to talk to me about anything, and she's spent a fair bit of time talking to me about what she's thinking and where she's at.  Over the course of the weekend, I've noticed a trend that she is seeming a lot less confident of the delusion.  She's now wondering whether the initial incident that seemed to be the trigger for this - where she 'saw' the guy at a hospital and heard him say 'why isn't she acknowledging me' was a dream or not.  And, she's not confident when the last time she saw him was.  (The last time would have been 10 - 11 years ago, when he was the HR person at a company she worked for....)

She still firmly believes he's her soul mate, but now its not a romantic thing, but just a companion type of thing. 

She's helping around the house, concerned whether she is doing enough to help, and starting to be very concerned about who I've told what to.

A friend and I had done some drywalling in the basement to get a retreat set up for her, with her bed set up.  She finished moving down there on Sunday.  But, last night she wanted to watch some TV with me, and the girls were watching in the TV room.  She asked if we could watch in our room, and so we were lying on the bed watching TV for a while.... 

I've made sure she knows that while I understand she doesn't have any desire to be in a relationship with me right now, that from my point of view, she has not closed any doors.

So, are things perfect?  Hell no.

Do they seem to be getting better?  I think so.

We went out as a family to the zoo on Saturday.  It was great to get out and do something with everyone.

Thanks for reading!

First I blamed it on not having graduated, then on my job, and she just kept getting frustrated at my bad attitude and my highs and lows. ""One day you´re so sweet to me and then you´re just so irritable. Why can´t you just be normal?"" I remember her saying. We always had petty fights and the dumbest things would irritate and bring up my anxiety levels. I wished I could just stop them from coming up. Went to a psychologist who just said it was social phobia. 

Two months ago, though, we went on a trip with two of her girl-friends. They wanted to stay at the docks after midnight and I kept saying it was dangerous. Ex girlfriend gets pissed that I´m not letting her enjoy time with her friends as she could. 

When we´re back in the room she starts calling me names and whatnot just really being very offensive, and says ""I´m going to the other room."" Which was when I grabbed her and lost her, apparently I pushed her on the bed and told her she wasn´t going anywhere while holding her down. (I would never ever ever have hit her though, I just grabbed and held her very inappropriately. Afterwards, the most shocked person about what had happen could´ve easily been me.) Anyway, her two friends barge in and start calling me names. Long story short, I left the hotel a total wreck, crying my eyes out knowing that that relationship was over. (I´m still going over that episode in my mind every day. Awful.)

About a month later, the anxiety got so bad I finally gathered the courage to ask my parents if I could go see a psychologist who then referred me to a psychiatrist.

I don't want this to be too long of a post.  Over the past week or so, I've read through a lot of the stories that have been posted here.  Reading through your posts honestly flipped a switch and allowed me to admit to myself that yes, this is something I have.  It was strange to read how specifically they reflected events in my life.  I intend to write out more of my history, because I think there are some stories that someone who is in the same place in their life may find helpful. 

I always felt that I had it under control, and have done very well career wise.  My wife and I had been fighting pretty badly, and I agreed to go to therapy.  That led to a psychologist visit and a psychiatrist visit.  They all agreed that I suffered from Bipolar Type 2.  I started taking Lamictal six months ago, and always felt like it was a concession to my wife to hopefully end the fighting.  

After reading through your stories, I was pretty shaken.  I feel pretty alone right now.  I have a lot of questions (you have no idea how long this took to write), but mostly right now, I want to know how you know what baseline is?  How do you know when you are 'okay'?

Last year, I finally went to a psychiatrist (at 34) and learned officially what I already knew.  I have bipolar disorder, type II.  We discussed various medications but he felt that I was handling things well unmedicated and left it up to me to decide if I wanted to go on meds.  At the time, I wasn't particularly up or down, so I unwisely didn't start medication. 

I'm currently in a mixed state- I drank so much alcohol on Saturday I'm surprised I'm still here.  I puked all day yesterday whilst hating myself, and today I called out of work because I'm simply too nuts to be there.

I know I have to change some things- clearly, the alcohol isn't a help so that's sworn off...again.  I knew I was going to be making bad decisions as soon as the particularly desperate thoughts started circling.  I'm annoyed with myself because I knew better but I did it anyway.

I need advice about medications for people with Bipolar II.  I generally handle my episodes pretty well- I have relatively regular cycles that I can chart by looking at my journals or even facebook posts over the course of a year.  I cycle about 4 or 5 times a year (with occasional lengthier phases, usually of depression).  The depressions leave me fat, miserable, and numb, the manias usually have me fixated on some idea - something I need to learn or do or buy that I later end up completely over once I'm depressed again.  I have intermediate stages where I'm ok-ish.

Thanks for listening.  Any advice on meds or how to continue to be a functional bipolar II person is appreciated.  I don't know anyone with Bipolar II and I'm feeling kind of lost.

I just got off the phone with the doctor and there is finally a diagnosis for my wife.  (He apologized for taking so long.  There had been a communications mix-up at the hospital, and he thought I had already been talked to.)  

Its not a big surprise to me at this point: Bipolar with psychotic tendencies.  She is being treated with  Lorazepam and Olanzapine (20 mg).

He currently believes that she will be in the hospital for two to four more weeks.

Her personality seems to have bounced back, but she is still pretty firm with her delusions.  She *is* interacting very well with our daughters, and has now been given 1 - 2 hour passes from the ward (with a responsible adult) so we can go to the park or something like that with her.  (I would *not* be bringing her home on a pass, because she seems to get stressed at the hospital if I even mention it).

I'm thinking that taking her to the dog park with our Boxer on Saturday or Sunday may be good idea...

I have a girl who I care a lot about and she cares about me(I hope) and everything seems really good.  I also have been sober for a couple weeks and plan to remain that way til the summer solstice.  

However I had gone through a pretty intensive long lasting manic phase from around January til March.  Of course there were still some ups and downs but I felt that real natural high a lot, although it never really got out of control.  And I was just thinking about some things I do while I am manic or feeling really good besides ""racing thoughts, less sleep, more sex"" the accepted clinical sings.  

One that's definitely strange for me is that water tastes absolutely delicious.  It tastes exponentially better than if I am stable or depressed.  I guess I just realize how important it is to life and it really does taste really good.  So I am usually hydrated while in these states which is good.  I don't really notice this with food, think it tastes good but there is no drastic change like there is with water.  I usually eat less while manic actually because I feel like I don't need it, I already have enough energy.  

Another one is that I NEED music, it is essential.  I have to have it :) And when I am not listening to it there will be a song stuck in my head that sounds very vivid, like I basically have my headphones on.  So it seems as if I always have music, even if I am in class or at work where I can't have music.  It is usually hard for me not to be singing or humming the song but it is very realistic, I suppose my imagination and memory are just heightened.  Favorites are Hendrix, Sublime, Daft Punk, Robert Johnson, Miles Davis, P-Funk, Zeppelin, but I love all music.  

I love talking to random people that I have no former knowledge or acquaintance with as well.  I go out of my way to meet strangers and talk to them and hang out with them.  Met a lot of people that way but got myself in trouble as well.  Usually have pretty intense conversations with these people as well.

I'll go through phases of writing lots while I am manic or not at all.  But I can fill up pages and pages with poetry and goofy lines and little insights I think are clever.  But other times I will be so involved with life I don't really have time to write.  I will have lines and pieces going through my head but I never write them.  

I like to stare at the sun while I am manic :) that must be somewhat unique haha.  Not very healthy for my eyes, but I feel like it is good for my spirit.  

I love playing footy when I am manic as well and will often take my ball with me everywhere I go in my backpack.

I seek to reveal 

My life's Achilles’s heel

My malignant mania has gave me zeal,

and it is my mania that will consistently steal,

from my life that seems unreal.

This is not the true me, I appeal.


Mania causes narcissistic actions,

Audacious counteractions,

My indulging in narcotic satisfactions,

And my multitude of sexual transactions.


Excuse me for my exuberance,

I am auspiciously ambitious,
 
adding too any classes,

dancing around campus.


My hands are so sweaty,

They could use a dry clean.

Maybe it's excitement,

or too much caffeine.

Maybe it was that morning run across the ocean scene.

I got so high, it was obscene.

As I pushed past my limits against the aquamarine.

This high should be illegal like under eighteen.


A friend said I looked like I was on X,

I laughed because what can you expect,

from someone who doesn't reflect,

or have brain chemistry so complex,

Who only partake in safe sex,

Who reads the law and respects?


No, I said. This is my sober, just wholly aware,

Of the duality of self: 2 pole - air,

One euphoric, other in despair.

Both can't sleep. This life is unfair.

I am dying for a breathe of calm air.


Or some Xanax would be key,

Or some opium in my tea,

or a guitar string under my pinky.

Truth is, I just want to be fucking free.

I can't seem to harness this vitality.

My passion, my pain are soaring into infinity.

Please doctor, help me find some equanimity.

new level of awareness.” 

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2009 after I had entered a state of ecstasy so powerful I thought I had died and was headed for heaven. It was the most profound and important experience of my life. Unfortunately, traditional mental-health care professionals did not recognize any positive potential in my crisis; they saw it as a manifestation of mental disease and responded with stigmatizing labels, suppressive drugs, and institutionalization. So, rather than ""being saved by God"", I was hospitalized, put on heavy medication, and told I couldn't recover.

After two weeks I crashed and was back in consensus reality: which made me really depressed. I did not know what happened, the prescribed medication made me feel worthless, and I wondered if my psychiatrists was right that I was really sick. 

Then I found others who had similar experiences and put their crises in a more positive story (see examples below), was treated as a fellow human being instead of a patient, slowly waned of meds, and learned how to manage my feelings in some sense. This new look was the best thing that could happen to me. I haven't had any true depression in the three years after the first experience (while before I truly was a manic-depressive) and with the support of friends and my new outlook on what the bipolar manic crisis was I was able to work through it when it happened again in the beginning of 2011.

What helped for me was putting my 'disease' in a positive narrative instead of the devalued story that people are trapped in. Especially [Sean Blackwell's BipolarOrWakingUp videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=annotation_458663&amp;src_vid=Db8AYSrs2kk&amp;v=BnsTNEXMRL8) on Youtube told me the story that I thought it was. In a nutshell, Sean Blackwell equates the manic state with a collapse of the ego [:everything you think you are but are not] and depression as the worries and anxieties that come forth out of clinging to the desires of the ego). 

I highly recommend his videos (watch the first 5 which takes about 40 minutes) for a different outlook on bipolar disorder. Watch them [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=annotation_458663&amp;src_vid=Db8AYSrs2kk&amp;v=BnsTNEXMRL8).

**What are your thoughts on this? Can you equate the bipolar manic crisis with nirvana in Zen, samadhi in Hinduism, or the visions of Christian Saints (as Sean Blackwell suggests)?** (Please note that it's not all happy stuff, he also looks at the negative sides: like [paranoia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZIQSCu4K_0) or ""[the dark night of the soul](http://www.ofspirit.com/bobolson40.htm)"".)


Similar ideas can be found in [the book Stormy Search for the Self](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stormy-Search-Self-Personal-Transformational/dp/087477649X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323120366&amp;sr=1-1) and [the ""spiritual emergency blogspot""](http://spiritualemergency.blogspot.com/)

(NOTE: if you are like me and exploring alternatives to the mainstream psychiatric system, please do so carefully and with the full support of people who empathize with your struggle.)

/edit kilokhan said that there need to be peer-reviewed articles to support the argument about alternative treatments. There happens to be a project that treated people without medication (in a more ""spiritual"" way). This (suppressed by NIMH) 'Soteria' method without medication is just as or even more effective than with. See for example [this](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1939-0025.1975.tb02556.x/abstract) and [this](http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Abstract/2003/04000/Treatment_of_Acute_Psychosis_Without_Neuroleptics_.2.aspx) article about Soteria, where
&gt;a sustained emotional relaxation became a main therapeutic focus which was not primarily achieved with neuroleptic drugs, but rather with continually and emphatically ""being with"" the tension-overwhelmed psychotic patient, in an as normal, open, family-like, protecting and relaxing setting as possible.

That type of treatment without medication proved to be just as effective or even more effective than with drugs.

They go on all day long without ceasing unless I am very distracted. It got worse and worse since it first came on.

Bipolar has ruined my life and I have to work extremely hard to enjoy fantasy both sexual and non-sexual while other people can go off to la-la land on the flick of a switch and be perfectly content. I miss immersing myself in video games and anime and movies and actually enjoying myself without having a barrage of unwanted thoughts. I miss being able to look people in the eye without calling them the most vulgar and horrible names imaginable. The state of depression I'm in just feeds the thoughts. I constantly reflect on how I was before Bipolar hit me.

I have to wait another three or so weeks of hell to find out if my medication works. I'm trying Latuda and there is no guarantee. I'm also on Lamictal which I'm not sure if that's kicking in or not. If Latuda doesn't work, I'll become fat from taking Zyprexa because I have no other choice but to take an extreme medication with that side-effect. God knows what else will happen. I feel pessimistic and extremely jealous of other people's mental health. If meds don't work I'm just going to want to die, and I already feel like an empty husk of a human being filled with vile crappy thoughts most of the time.

But the big days seem small, and they all blur together.  A day, a month, a year?  Who knows anymore.  I can't keep track.  My past is present.  Everything that happened to me decades ago -- my whole life -- isn't so much passing before my eyes.  No.  It's just all here.  SItting on my shoulders.  Crushing me under the weight of it.  I am simultaneously conscious of everything that I have ever done.  I'm conscious of every way I've ever looked at a problem.  I'm conscious of every book I've ever read, every song I've ever heard and every movie I've ever seen.  It's all here.  All of it.  Right now.  It cripples me.  It makes me unable to focus or even to think.  It makes me feel like an ant.

But it makes me feel like a god.  To see one's life stripped bare from above, in its entirety gives new meaning to the world.  I can see the cloth that my life has been woven from, with each thread in microscopic detail.  I can see the perfect moments and know that they are perfect.  I can remove myself entirely from myself and look to the cloth, stitch ripper in hand, ready to cut threads and break cycles.  I close my eyes and I see, in vivid detail, a cacophony of images screaming towards me like a surrealist's flipbook.  I can see the perfect moments but they're fleeting.  The painful moments are much more numerous.  I close my eyes and it's a projector on a loop that keeps running over and over but only the first 30 seconds of the film is perfection.  It goes first because it's the most important.  Pain comes next.  The pain lasts hours.  There's a lot of it there.  It's also important.  It's what makes me want to live.  It's what makes me want to change -- myself and the world around me.  It's what makes me see the things that I see on a daily basis.

I'm honestly not sure what comes after the pain.  I've never been in this mindstate long enough to wait that out.  I have days of the pain to flip through.  Weeks.  It makes me afraid to close my eyes.  I can see it in my mind's eye either way, but the visual always comes when my eyes are closed.  I feel like I'm in an Elm Street movie and I don't want to sleep because of Freddie.  But I want to sleep.

1317235777.0,16,self.BipolarReddit,kucuj,The loony-bin?,16,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/kucuj/the_loonybin/,"I was just wondering what others experiences with being bakeracted(FL thing), checked into psychiatric ward/crisis center/etc were.. 

I've been baker acted 3 times in my life. Twice in middle school, once recently.. The first couple of times I was a minor and they only kept me over night for observation and let me go the next day. 

This most recent time, I was kept for 3 days in a crisis center. Now the reason I ask is.. I find these places to be the opposite of what they should be. I think they're supposed to help you, help you feel better. This most recent time I went to a place, they just threw me in there, no explanations of rules or anything about the place. It was a very confusing and scary experience. There was an old lady that kept talking to herself about murdering girls. They also kept the drug detox people in there as well. We were kept mostly in two small areas of rooms. There was a room with tables and chairs, then another area with a locked up TV and rows of chairs. There was about 25 total people in there including me at the time. The only ""activities"" available were they had a few coloring papers printed out and some crayons. Then whatever they had playing on the TV, which one of the entire days was nothing but football.

The first night I was there, they denied me my meds so I had a fun day of withdrawal the next morning. After being there for a day, they finally had me speak to a psychiatrist who seemed like a real asshole, he spoke to me asking me very.. manipulative ? questions for like 3 minutes and wouldn't listen to anything else I had to say explaining what happened. (These days I tend to be very in touch with what's going on with me.. I recognize what happened, why it happened, why it shouldn't have happened and knew how I was feeling.) Those three minutes were about it.. I talked to one of the workers there at one point who said afterward she was 95% sure I'd be let go after just another night of observation to make sure everything was okay. 

The next day.. no word of me leaving, I spoke to no one. The set of staff had switched out. At this point I was getting depressed/upset and it was the first time I cried since I got there. I tried speaking to one of the new workers about them saying they were only keeping me for one night, all she said was, ""oh. you should have said something to me before the doctor left, which he already has."" it was about noon at this point I think.. Gee.. thanks for letting me know about that and what times that asshole of a psychiatrist would be there. 

The whole experience was both depressing, scary and boring. There was nothing to do. I had my boyfriend bring me some new crayons, a coloring book, a book to read and some word search books to keep me busy. (Although I had to return the crayons to the staff when I was finished using them.) You sleep/wake up when they want you to. They kept forgetting about me though because I guess when they brought me in, there was no beds in the rooms available so they just had me sleeping in one of the isolation rooms. I didn't really mind that though, I would prefer being alone to being in a room with several other strangers. They feed you terrible, unhealthy, disgusting food. (isn't a healthy diet a part of mental well being?) One of the lunches was 2 rolls with two packets of peanut butter.. (is this prison?) There is an outside closed off area but I can only remember being let out there like once for 15 minutes during my stay there. (isn't fresh air/sunlight also important to your well being?) They kept the AC to where everyone complained they were freezing. The whole atmosphere was incredibly depressing and there was just so much negativity surrounding me. 

Overall I have to say, I've felt so much worse since being there than I ever did before I went in. Has anyone actually ever found those places to be helpful to you? I guess if you are homeless/have no where to go it might be helpful but if you have somewhere you can go where someone cares about you.. it seems like such a better option.

I'm afraid to look too long, into myself, for fear that he reaches out and pulls me in, like some kind of black hole of negativity.

I've accepted every part of my diagnosis, it was a relief, to know that I wasn't just a total failure, that I should actually be proud of the things I've done. The thing is, it still kind of shocks me when I tell myself that ""I have a mental illness"".

Sometimes I doubt it in a way, telling myself I'm not crazy, but none of us here are crazy. All of us are probably, on average, super empathetic, kind, and intellegent.

It's hard to differentiate true and natural feelings, from the symptoms of the disorder. I will just tell myself I had a bad day, and that tomorrow will be better. Everyone has bad days right? What happens when every day is a bad day, over and over. I'm stressed about my job, but my stress is due to the disorder, which in turn amplifies my symptoms. I can't salvage my job unless I feel better, and I can't feel better unless I can salvage my job. It's a vicious, never ending cycle.

The medicine helps my baseline, making me feel pretty okay most of the time, but the second my (extremely low) stress threshold is exceeded, I become a ""crazy person"" totally paralyzed by fear and anxiety. The bizarre thing is I don't believe I have any anxiety problems at all. This is all due to my infinate stress loop.

I know we like to say that we are not the disorder, rather we have it. I believe that, but to an extent, it's who I am. My feelings, especially when involving stress are amplified multiple times compared to that of the average person. I feel deeper and more fully. I don't think I can, or should, change it. I think I can only control the outside world as best we can, avoiding stress and the like.

I posted about how this disorder was ruining my life, blah blah blah. I mentioned I was off my meds, and that was the first thing you all caught. You told me most people who go off their meds go manic, and that was probably why I was feeling better. 

Well, it blew up into a crazy mixed episode for me. I was all over the place, even missing a big class presentation so I could go straight to campus counseling. I went from laughing to crying at an insane rate. Everything I felt was extreme. 

I finally got back on Lithium, and while I don't know if it's possible to have kicked in so soon, I know the mania is gone. I haven't quite crashed into a depression; it's more like apathy at the moment. Like I felt so many extreme things I burned myself out. It's much better than what I was going through last week, but now I have to pick up the pieces of my relationships and try to catch up in school. Luckily I'm set to graduate on Saturday, so I think that will help a lot. Still a little upset over how I ended my relationship, but my ex and I are still friends so I guess that helps. 

The point of all of this is to thank you all. I know we're all dealing with this really tough thing. So many of us are struggling to find hope. Meds are definitely not the ideal solution, especially because it can take so long to find the right combination.

This is after he told me last week that he loved and cared for me (as friends) and that he would be there for me whenever I needed him. 

The whole conversation began because when I was depressed on Sunday, I called G. Everyone else was busy working or something and I can usually count on G because he's up at all hours and works from home now. Anyway, he was at a barbecue that day, so I knew he didn't have much time to talk. There was nothing wrong with that. What was wrong was the way he tried to rush me off the phone and after listening on the other end I knew why: his gf, who doesn't like me, was there. This hurt considering she has done some terrible stuff to me in the past.

I called him the next day about it, and he told me I was right, that he didn't want to talk to me while his gf was around, even when I was depressed because ""it could've waited a few days (even one day is unbearable)"", ""you're not like your cousin (who attempted suicide the previous week)"", and ""it would've taken a long time (it's not about the amount of time with me)"". That (long) conversation turned into him saying he couldn't be there for me anymore.

This is all overwhelming. I'm also going through a cervical cancer scare and am in constant pain from the biopsy. I have been very depressed for going on two months with little relief from my medication. I feel like I'm bottoming out.

And then I realized that the dbt therapist should have much better skills. The session started out on the wrong foot when I waited for my appointment, I got there early, and was really nervous, I saw that it was ten minutes late and no one came for me. That's not uncommon, but for some reason I started to feel anxious that he forgot or I was there on the wrong day, so I called an left a message. Thirty seconds later I hear footsteps in the hallway and he apologized that he was running late. I though ok, that happens. 

We sit down and he's fiddling with a clock on a table beside him, I ask him about it and he says that he has trouble keeping time so he sets a timer for his sessions. That he ""doesn't observe the clock well"" and he gestures with his head to a small decorative clock on the wall that has hands but no numbers, and I think, how the hell can anyone tell time on that? I realize that he is late, not because of a circumstance with a patient, but because he can't tell time and had I not called I don't know how long I would have been waiting.

We talk for a while and I mention my struggles with wanting to commit suicide, and he stops and asks me about it. I tell him that I'm not in danger, but it's been hard for me. He tells me that he's no longer taking patients that are suicidal because he had a patient who had committed suicide and bascially that he was still struggling with it and he couldn't go through that again. I had empathy for him, but at the same time was thrown and upset because I don't know what to do.

I'm stammering and upset and trying to reassure him that I'm ok, he replieds putting his hand to his heart and says that his ""heart was still racing"" from what I said to him, and that he needed time to think before he would know if he could accept me as a client or not. I realized quickly that this was a ""no deal"" and asked him to give me references, (because this was going to be an issue with him and even if he accepted me I didn't want it interfering with my therapy). He said something apologetic and I let him know that it's been a very frustrating experience for me finding a therapist who can take me (I have strict work hours and financial limitations). He told me he ""felt bad"" for doing this and I said that ""he should"" (because I was upset, feeling abandoned, and didn't feel that he was being sincere, it was kinda condescending and superficial), which he then replied something along the lines that he didn't like that I said that, and by that point I feel like I am about to go over the edge and told him that ""he should just deal with it. After I said that I could see he has decided that my behavior is unacceptable as a patient (as I had already decided he's unfit as a therapist for patients who require dbt) and he's still shakily trying to write down names for me. I reiterated how frustrated and upset I was and that I didn't know what I was going to do (and caught myself almost threatening suicide, while at the same time mentally biting my tongue HARD, because I'm upset and feeling let down and abandoned by this guy and desperate that I can't get help, but I really don't want to do this to that guy, so I control it). And finally I'm so worked up and furious that this guy was highly recommended to me that I say ""I have to leave now"" and storm out.

I basically make it home and crash (sleep). I wake up and decide that I need to figure out what my deal is, am I going to the right people, am I borderline or bipolar? So I decided (stupidly) to search for ""borderline"" on reddit, the posts are awful posts about how terrible people's girlfriends are and the typical attacks on women in a male dominated enviroment, and then I proceed to read about borderline personality disorder on wikipedia. At this point I feel like I'm doomed with a terrible, frightening, and untreatable disease. Reading people's posts I feel like the Frankenstein Monster in the novel, where the villagers are going to hunt me down with pitchforks shouting ""Crazy Bitch. Burn the Witch!"" There was a short period of time (maybe a half hour or less) where I felt really, really bad and frightened that I could be borderline. 

For some reason though, I think whatever I learned in dbt kicked in (from over a year ago), because I mellowed out. I'm still a little worried I could be borderline, which sounds like a fate worse than bipolar, I didn't know this was possible. Reading Marsha Linehan's works in the past I had more of a empathetic concept of borderline personality disorder, she really is probably the only person who treats this disorder kindly. I think I do have some of the ""traits"", which are going to make it difficulter than bipolar (because meds don't help entirely solve the problem), but Linehan makes is sound solvable. 

It's still a little scary though. I know I say things that upset people, that I misread situations and can be paranoid. I've also been told I'm not as bad as I think I am, yet I can't seem to sustain any relationships. The thing is, I've read about terrible, horrible things men have done to the women who are with them, and I think how the hell is it that they have someone in their life and I don't? Not that I want a dysfunctional relationship, but I would really like to meet and be with that (monogamous non-cheating) person who understands me, who can see past the ""disorder"". I also have a lot of tolerance (and am faithful in relationships) for other people's crap, and people have thanked me for listening and being supportive of them when they feared others wouldn't (though I wondered at their lack of support, especially when I'm doing what I feel I ought to be doing, and that it's ""natural"", but then acknowlegding the people they grew up with and their enviroment, I understood why they felt that way). I don't think this is a one-side thing. I've experienced some forms of abuse growing up, and have also learned to break away from it (I learned that I didn't have to repeat the way I was treated, though I worry that there are still remnants that I haven't overcome). The end result is that I can see and understand abuse from both sides, and I hope that makes me a kinder person, because I don't want to repeat what others have done to me. But I also don't want to be a welcome mat for people to wipe their feet (I suspect this happens more than me being mean to others).

I don't even know how to summarize this, so if anyone read through all of this, thank you for taking the time to read it.

Also, 21/M. 

Recently, I had to quit the sports team I'm on because of being ostracized by nearly everyone on the team. I loved the sport, but the individuals on the team made it a living hell for me. I tried so hard to be nice to everyone and they just saw me as ""that weird dude"" and bullied me. I was immediately set as an outcast when I chose not to go and drink / smoke with them at college parties and it only got worse from there on out. 

I don't know what to say - I don't know what to do, I've known this sport for the past three years and it's been something of stability in my life, it's been constant, while everything else has shifted. It's weird to have quit, but in a sense it is a bit of a relief.

On top of that, I've been rejected by the woman I've fallen hard for. I used to not care, I used to just be able to move on from girls like it was nothing, but this girl has hit me hard and I can't get over it. I feel like it's obsessive and weird at this point. It was just a rejection, I've been rejected before, so why does this one just linger? (more of a rhetorical question). I find that I crave human interaction, but I always seem to blow it when I try so hard and I must give off some weird vibe or something. I just want to be accepted, that's all...


I can't help but feel that people are against me, and I am fully aware that this might be paranoia, but I don't feel like I have any genuine friends in this world. Sure, you have the people you say hi to and bullshit with them, but never anyone who actually ""has your back"" and wishes to hang out with you. 

It's interesting, I'm so self-aware and in some sense, self-critical as well, but I don't have the means to be diagnosed at this point in time. I know there are natural remedies out there since I'm quite weary of synthetic drugs. What are my options? How can I stabilize my highs and my lows?

Its been a while since I've posted an update, so I thought I'd fire one off.  As a quick summary, last year, in Sept, my wife had her first manic episode (that we're aware of) and ended up being hospitalized for six weeks.  The diagnosis was bipolar with psychotic episodes.  

One of the key delusions she had during this period was that she was a princess, that a former manager that she had had was her 'white knight' who was coming from either England or Australia (she wasn't sure where) to take her and our girls away and back to her throne.  And she was going to be leaving me for this white knight (who she had told me in the past was gay), and that he had been the puppet master, pulling all the strings making events happen in her life for the past two decades.

If you're interested in seeing the whole drama play out, feel free to browse my history....

I'd love to tell you that everything is back to normal now.  I really would.  Unfortunately it would mean that I would be living in my own little dream world too....

Not much has changed since my last update.  My wife is still on Olanzypine (20 mg daily).  Her common complaints are that she feels emotionally numb, which I believe is due at least partially to the medication.

She still has an attachment to her former manager, and says that she misses him (she has never been romantically involved with him), and she is beginning to acknowledge that he probably represents freedom / happiness to her, and that is what she is missing.

Originally she had committed to working with me until July before leaving.  Now she seems to have committed for another year, and is starting to spend the money she had been saving to move out on home renovations.

She enjoys cuddling and holding hands and talking in the evening, but seems afraid of any 'public' sign of affection (even holding hands), and says she has no romantic thoughts about me, but that we're good friends.

We had gone to a therapist available through my work's employee assistance plan, and that helped me, but not her so much.  Today however, we have our first session with a psychotherapist.  Hopefully enough time has passed that my wife is ready to start working on the relationship.

Recently I posted an update wondering whether she might be entering another episode.  It appears I may have been premature on that.  She had had a week of bad sleep, and was starting to seem a bit disconnected, and starting to draw connections between people / events in her past that didn't seem reasonable.  Since then, she has gotten a presecription for a sleep aid to be taken as needed, has had two weeks of good sleep, and seems back to normal.  Obviously one thing I need to be watchful for in the future is patterns of sleep disruption.

One thing that is good is that a 'bad day' now is so much better than what a 'good day' was a few months ago.

Thanks for reading, have a great day.

**TL;DR**  No real change in our status.  We're starting to see a psychotherapist today.

1362018726.0,14,self.BipolarReddit,19dcj4,Question: how to discuss beginning of a possible episode with my wife without sounding like I'm paranoid about any minor change in her behaviour?,15,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/19dcj4/question_how_to_discuss_beginning_of_a_possible/,"Morning!

In September my wife had her first 'major' episode, which required hospitalization.  It was diagnosed as bipolar with psychotic episodes.  During the episode, she had delusions of a former manager becoming her white knight, who would come to take her away.

One of the things I noticed with that episode is that **everything** that happened was related in her mind -- there were no coincidences.  And any random person who did anything **had** to be related to the manager or be operating on his orders.

My wife is on Olanzypine (20 mg daily), and has been taking the medication regularly to the best of my knowledge.  And it seemed to be working.  But, lately (in the past few days) she seems to be starting to draw connections between people in her past back to that manager again.  One person she danced with 15 years ago, **must** be related  to the manager because he had blue eyes.  

She spent a half hour last night talking about how all the different people from 10 to 15 years ago must have all been working together with the former manager.

Now, I don't know for a fact that this is **new** behaviour.  She had quit talking like this for quite a while, so I don't know whether she had just stopped talking to me about it, or whether she had stopped thinking like that.

And, I don't want to scare her into not talking to me about things.

She had an appointment with her pdoc today, and (with my urgings) she told him about some sleep issues that she's been having lately (waking up every hour), so he prescribed a sleep aid to be taken as needed (I haven't seen the prescription yet, so I don't know which one)

So, should I 

 * talk about my concerns to her?
 * wait and see how this progresses before doing anything? (I'm hoping the sleep will help restore her balance)

I'm leery about talking to her pdoc about it, because the last time I gave him information, he told my wife that 'Your husband says that....' and she quit talking to me about things for a while...

Thanks for the advice!

**EDIT**

I plan to talk to my wife with the general approach of:

Hon, the other evening something you said worried me.  You started drawing lots of connections between different events in your life, such as dancing with XXX, seeing people with him show up six months later at a bar with someone else, so she had to be his daughter, etc.  This behaviour is similar to what you were doing just you were hospitalized, and it concerns me.

First I saw a psychologist, then a psychiatrist - both said I'm bipolar depressive more-so, but the psychiatrist (or whoever prescribes meds) took a much more thorough approach the secondary time around and diagnosed me as Bipolar type 1. I haven't been formally diagnosed since I was about 15/16. (And it wasn't ever properly documented.) But now I have and I feel so validated.

I feel so effin' validated.

I feel like I'm not insane. That I'm actually ... I don't know any other word regardless of validated. Because I do. And he even went as far as to prescribe me medication. I'm just starting out at 25mg of Lamotrigine (a generic med for something else I couldn't quite pronounce.) and I'm working my way up to 50mg and then 100mg. 

Mostly, I just wanted to put it out there that I feel a lot better. I know that I didn't just dream up the day that I was diagnosed, or that I have it and live with it every day. I don't know how to describe the feeling. I just... I haven't had this kind of a relief in years. I just feel so ^^~~fucking~~ validated!

On top of all of this, I haven't had to pay (and no I'm not insured) for anything other than the meds.

(For anyone looking for the backstory, my last update was http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/13hvdy/11_weeks_4_days_since_my_wifes_diagnosis/)

**Summary**

My wife was diagnosed with bipolar at the end of August, and was hospitalized for 6 weeks.  Part of the problem had been psychosis, with a delusion that she was a princess, and that a white knight (former manager) was coming to rescue her and take her, and our two girls, away.

**Current**

Its been a long, slow process, but things are continuing to improve.

We kept Christmas / New Years low key, and I'm glad we did.  As it was, the stress was more than I was expecting, and my wife was definately *not* in the Christmas spirit.  Normally she is big into decorating the house, getting everything ready, etc.  This year, she put minimal energy into it, and even the tree wouldn't have got done if I hadn't started it...

Christmas day went well though, and we had a good, relaxing time.  New Years Eve went Ok, although she started getting distant as the evening went on.  I'm assuming because of the 'expectations' of relationships, intimacy, etc. that are associated with midnight.

After New Years, things improved.  We were talking, hugging, cuddling.

Then, I made a mistake...  I tried to talk to her about her feelings with intimacy.  She immediately went distant, and for two days was talking a lot about wanting to move to the west coast, obsessing over 'the guy' that she has been crushing on, and being distant from me.

But, that ended almost as quickly as it started.  And things improved.  While she shies away from intimacy, we have gotten a lot closer.  She enjoys getting massages from me, we hug regularly, and cuddle at night.  So, big improvements have been happening!

As well, when we have gone out together on 'dates', she's not distant anymore, she's present, and we are able to socialize and have fun together.

And, at the counselling session yesterday, she even said that sometimes when we are cuddling things even feel right between us, so she is **starting** to have feelings towards me again.  And that things also feel right when we are doing family things together with the kids.

Yes, I know there is still a long way to go.  But, 2012 is over, and 2013 is looking a lot better...

TL;DR 2012 sucked.  2013 improving.

I saw my school drug counsler at the beginning of the semester. He knows my case, and I was also seeing him when I was doing therapy and taking my meds. I was clean when I saw him and I described to him what was new, and he asked me if I thought I were bipolar. Then he told me that I am. And urged me to keep seeing him and seeing a counsler and psychiatrist to start the whole treatment plan again. I was mad. I had stopped seeing him after that visit. If it counts at all, I saw him because he had a smoking cessation program and I was trying to quit cigs at that time. He actually advised me not to quit since I had stayed clean for months. He said quitting smoking may lead to indulging in fun poop.

My symptoms have been getting more apparent and more crippling. Ups and downs as you all know. One new symptom is I have lost track of days three times in the past month or so. This has caused me to miss a couple of school days and being late and unperpared and failing a final. Has thinking today is a different day happened to any of you? I've skimmed some of the memory posts, but I am not sure if the posts talk about losing track of days. I also have a hard time estimating when events had happened (a month vs. a week). Obviously it is fucking me up. And it usually happens when the manic, impulsive, ""now"" episodes subside.

I am calling a new psychiatrist tomorrow to set up an appointment, but I can't sleep--I doubt I will tonight.

Since I am already posting, how do you guys deal with the downs? They cripples me. No showers, no food, lots of sleep, no phone, no brushing my teeth, etc.... I think of suicide a lot when I am down, but I highly doubt I'll realize it in the next five years--I've promised myself. Is it just me or do people tend to overreact when someone says they've had suicidal thoughts? I mean, they are the shitty version of our God-like moments. Right? And there is a difference between thinking about suicide and plotting it and writing a note. Right?

She spent last weekend here, set up a 'sleepover' in the family room to sleep with our girls.  We are now talking and joking together, and a lot of things seem to be a lot closer to normal.  She has told me (but it hasn't been confirmed to me by the doc yet) that she will have an overnight pass for Wed next week, and then will be discharged on Thurs.  As she has misunderstood some of the timelines that the doc has told her in the past, I'm not putting this one at 100%, but it seems to be close to what the doc told me last week.

However, I've still got some BIG concerns.  Her delusion hasn't been shaken yet (as of Sunday).  When I talked to the doc on Friday, he felt that the delusion was starting to be shakeable.  On Sunday I asked my wife what she remembered about going in to the hospital, and we talked about it.  She still believes that her white knight, her soul-mate, is coming from Australia for her.  

But, when we were talking, she said that she thought she had saw him at church, and was proud that she hadn't 'freaked out'.  When she was admitted to the hospital, she was suffering physical reactions (racing heart, out of breath, feeling faint) when she thought about the guy.  Now she thought she saw him, and just proceeded on with the girls and me.

And, obviously, while she believes that the white knight is coming, she has no interest in trying to work on restoring our relationship.  She has flat out refused any counselling at this point, as it would be a waste of time since ""there is no spark between us"".  Right now she wants to set up a room in the basement and move in there.  She's come to realize that she won't be able to move out right away without totally disrupting the family, and probably making us lose the house.  She wants a stable environment for the kids, (and me to have custody) and has agreed to wait to the end of the school year before actually moving out.

I like that - it gives the meds more time, and her more time, and the pdoc more time to work on her delusion.  The pdoc seems to feel that based on her progress, that she will want to work on the relationship after she makes further progress.  My response to him was that I realized that at the end of the process she may still decide that she doesn't want to be with me - I just want her to be able to make that decision rationally.

The pdoc does not THINK she will take the kids and run, but I'm taking the precautions I can.  I've got our passports secured in our safety deposit box, I've separated our finances, I've advised the school that I would like to be called if anyone tries to take our daughters out of school (I can't stop her from taking them out as she has not been declared non-competent, and there is no legal custody document).

Questions for the peanut gallery:

1) The day that she comes home happens to be our 9th anniversary.  It obviously would not be a good idea to make a big deal out of it.  Yesterday, when I was asked what I did after work, I answered that I had 'picked my wife up from the hospital'.  She was visibly distressed when I said this, and had to leave the room to collect herself.  

On the other hand, I don't really want to ignore it either.  I was thinking of getting a pottery vase (pottery is for 9) with some flowers, and a card saying welcome home / happy anniversary.  Would this sound appropriate?  Or should I just ignore the anniversary?

2) Should I talk to her about her delusion?  Or just let her bring it up when she is ready?

3) In the past she has NOT been good at remembering to take medication.  I think she wouldn't intentionally 'forget' to take them, but I am worried whether she will have problems actually remembering whether she's had them already or not.  Any suggestions for techniques or tools to help with that?

Thanks for listening, I'll look at posting an update probably the weekend of the 12th after she's been home for a few days.

I figured that I could defer to the school counselor if need be.

I'm not paralytically depressed, but I'm having daily suicidal thoughts. They're kind of thoughts I intellectually recognize and not ones that consume me. I guess I displace myself from them. But I think if a counselor asks me if I've had suicidal thoughts and I tell them this, they're going to overreact and make things worse more than better. I absolutely do not need to go to an inpatient hospital, and I know that anything like that would make my life more hellish because of medical absences.

1347602368.0,16,self.BipolarReddit,zv5c1,TIL psychosis can occur during either manic or depressive episodes and is one thing that differentiates Bipolar 1 from Bipolar 2.,21,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/zv5c1/til_psychosis_can_occur_during_either_manic_or/,"[Source](http://bipolar.about.com/od/diagnosissymptoms/a/psychosis_symptoms_hub.htm).

So, I have bipolar 1 disorder and have only ever experienced psychosis during manic episodes.  I did not know, however, that they could also occur in depressive episodes.  According to the above source, if you get psychotic during a manic episode, then you have Bipolar 1 disorder since psychosis can only occur during depressive episodes in BD2.

Personally, I've only ever been psychotic twice.  Once at the age of 14 in May 2004 after being on an antidepressant since December 2003.  The second time occurred shortly after giving birth to my son, and is classified as postpartum psychosis.  Both episodes occurred during manic phases, and both while not taking an antipsychotic medication.  I've never had problems with psychosis when properly medicated.

Anyway, I thought it was interesting and decided to share.  Anyone else here experience psychosis?

I feel like I'm ready to pull my hair out...,15,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/y5d3k/update_about_moms_attempted_suicidehospital_stay/,"In my original thread I mentioned that my mom overdosed on Ativan and I spent 15 hours in hospital with her waiting for her to wake up and talk to me. I went back to visit her yesterday and she was a little bit better, albeit still confused and feeling depressed. This morning she gives me a call telling me that instead of admitting her, like they said they were going to, they decided to discharge her. This effectively sends her back to her abusive boyfriend who was causing a lot of her problems, which she mentioned to them. Not only this, but they ONLY set her up with an appointment with an addiction service because they're blaming all of this on the fact that she had some beers first, which impaired her judgement. Yes, she DOES need to stop drinking, but she shouldn't be dismissing everything else in lieu of that fact. They didn't set her up with a psych appointment, even though she was receptive to changing her meds because she didn't feel that they were helping.

So.. she's on her way ""home"" right now because the doctors have convinced her that it's the best place for her while she ""gets better"". He's going to keep buying her beer. He's going to keep being abusive. She's going to keep having the same problems she always has had with her medication. Her and I both told the doctors about all of this, and they apparently just dismissed it.

I'm trying to figure out how I'm supposed to help. I told her that I will go with her to her appointments, I told her that if she moves out we can give her furniture and set her up, so there would be little to worry about. I remind her of what her boyfriend is like whenever she tries to defend him, but I also don't want to just make her feel guilty for staying because guilt is never a good thing. This situation, I don't even know what I'm supposed to do. I'm also trying to distance myself enough so that I can keep taking care of myself, but it's hard not to get right involved because it's my mom and I'm so afraid of this happening again.

It's happened before. It's a cycle of rinse and repeat. He makes her want to kill herself, she leaves, he's nice for a bit, she goes back, rinse, repeat. This was the first time she actually tried though, and I feel like it might only get worse from here. I told her I'm always available for her, and I am. I told her to call me if she's ever feeling down or like having a beer or like she needs help and I'll be right there, ready to help her. I've dropped everything to stay at the women's shelter with her before, so I hope she knows I'm serious about being there for her.

Last night I decided to trip again and took about two tabs. The trip started off normally for about 4 hours and then my thoughts started racing. I went manic and started having severe delusions of grandeur and paranoid thoughts. I believed I was God and that I could control my fate with my mind alone. My friends who were trip setting me said I went into a catatonic state and was unresponsive. I remember my mind going a millions miles a minute and then just blank. I woke up and didn't know who I was or remember anything. I sincerely believed that I was comatose and trapped in my mind. I left my friend's apartment and wandered around the city I was in aimlessly, standing in the middle of a major road watching cars pass by. Somehow I found my way back to the apartment without getting hurt or arrested. I so sincerely believed that I was either dead or comatose that I didn't believe my body or my friend was real. I bit my finger until it bled, but still didn't believe that I was in my body. The scariest part of all of this is that I remembered I had tripped, but still didn't believe it was because of that. I experienced full-blown psychosis and went into a dissociative fugue. Time stretched on endlessly and when I woke up in the morning I felt like a week had passed. My friend had to get on the phone with other people I knew just to convince me that I was alive. To say that the experience was overwhelming would be a serious underestimation. I started bawling with joy just because I was alive. I went to sleep thinking that I needed to either try to sleep and wake up from this coma or try to kill myself out of it.  


I always assumed that I knew enough and did my research on drugs. I have tried weed, LSD, 2c-i, and shrooms. Right on wikipedia it says that lithium users can experience a dissociative fugue. Drugs can be very fun and introspective when used properly, but here I fucked up big time. It is a miracle I am even alive given my state of mind. I was stupid and assumed nothing could affect me even with my disorder. 


To end on a more positive note something snapped in me through this experience. I don't know if it is because I felt like I went through a near death experience but I woke up today and knew exactly what I have been doing wrong with my life in the past year. I devoted my life to weed and escaping and lost my high school sweetheart of 2.5 years. I had no motivation and my grades were terrible. I blamed it all on my ADHD and bipolar. I never took responsibility for anything in my life. I have to live and deal with this disorder but it doesn't define me, and I won't let it. I no longer have a desire to smoke or escape reality. I know how I've hurt people and I need to mend a lot of relationships. For the first time since my diagnosis I felt capable of being me again. Being bipolar is tough, but it's not a reason to give up on yourself like I had. It sucks that I had to go through such a traumatic experience to realize what I have been doing to myself. I am not saying all drugs are bad or don't do them, but don't let them control your life. They can make conditions a lot worse and impede a normal recovery from an episode. And for anyone on lithium who has or wants to take LSD: Use extreme caution. Even if you are not on lithium LSD can cause you to go manic or psychotic. Don't be an idiot and fuck around with this disorder. I am lucky that I didn't get hurt, and that I woke up feeling reborn and ready to take on challenges I've been avoiding. This is the only life I have and I'm not going to let my disease determine my fate. And to all who feel hopeless, aimless, lost or confused, don't give up. You are still you and no matter how bad things seem to get only YOU can decide to do it right or not. Don't skip your meds. Don't spend all of your time just wasting away. Recognize that you can deal with the ups and downs and be the awesome creative person you are meant to be. Thank you for this community, you have helped me a lot and for the first time in a long time I am ready to live again. 
EDIT: UPDATE: I spoke with my friends, did some more research and talked to my psychologist and it seems I experienced a partial complex seizure before entering the dissociative state.

They made right decision because she's back to school now and doing fine.  I've learned alot and basically could get a doctorate on this, lol.  I can't thank reddit enough for helping me out when I was going crazy.  Everythings going to be ok - if she has more episodes, we will deal with them.  If she needs maint. meds we'll do it.  One thing I've come to realize, ""you don't plan life, you live it"".  She's happy - I'm happy.  Love you guys and thank you.

Feel free to let us know what your submission means to you. Did you create it for a reason or did it just flow from you? Did you create it when you were depressed, hypomanic, manic, in a mixed state, or did you create your piece while you were perfectly stable on your meds?

Feel free to comment on and discuss other people's submissions. Since this isn't a contest you can submit more than one piece.

I know that some people may have a tough time taking constructive criticism. I used to have a huge issue with that. I always felt that it was a personal attack on me. Now I understand that, when people criticize my work, they are doing it because they appreciate the effort I have made and they want to HELP me, NOT HURT ME.

If you ARE NOT open to criticism because you are still coming to grips so far as dealing with it, please let people know in your submission that you have a difficult time with criticism. Hopefully others will respect this. If people DO still criticize your work, please don't take it as a personal attack.

""I think once you meet these people, you realise that many use it as one of those anti-fashion icons (like the nerdy glasses without glass).
Knew a girl who was bi-polar. To give you an idea of the type of girl she was, after going out for a few drinks with the girls (and after 5 shots) she comes to us and says ""i think my drink was spiked, i feel dizzy and hot, then when i went out i felt cold, i also feel a bit sick"" and was adamant she was drugged, despite her alcoholic intake. She just wanted attention. Also, broke up with ex and became lesbian, until a nice guy came along and ""restored her faith in men"", never touched a woman.
So her bi-polar disorder was along the lines of 'i was happy this morning, and now I'm sad, I'm bi-polar'""

This lead to my second hospitalization and a medication change (which is so far so good).

Now for the gritty business.

I just suffered from the first episode I've had in about 6 years.  It was one of the WORST mixed states I've ever had.  I hadn't had a full night of sleep for close to a month, I wouldn't leave the house, I wouldn't eat, but I also lacked any motivation and felt very hopeless.  My anxiety was overwhelming and I was having several strong panic attacks a day.  Some were so bad that I would collapse while holding my chest.  After suffering for as long as I had I decided that I needed help and admitted myself (with full support from my SO) to the local emergency Psychiatric ward.  I've been there for well over a week now and I have been switched Seroquel every night and Epival twice daily.  I am feeling much more stable and am luckily suffering zero side effects from either medication.  My SO took it upon himself to move us out of our old apartment (which was one of the key reasons I had stopped sleeping, ant problems and the like) into a great new apartment.  I've been spending more time talking about and dealing with the things that I've been bottling up inside and I'm hoping that my bipolar will go into remission for several years again, if not longer.  As hard as it has been to be stuck in the hospital day after day, I feel like I made the right decision.

I guess that's all.  I just felt like giving everyone an update about what I've been up to.  I go back to the hospital tomorrow morning, but I've been told that I will probably be released by the middle of this coming week.

I was suffering a bit at the time with Agoraphobia and coping with people and the idea of going for blood tests and check ups scared me out of renewing my prescription.

Two weeks later I went to see my boyfriend who lives about 100 miles away which is when my moods started going out of control. For the last two weeks I have been at rock bottom I repeatedly hurt myself and attempted suicide while I was with him. There were many times that I was close to being hospitalised and the local mental health unit was called at one point during the week.

The whole event is fuzzy but I know that it was hard on my boyfriend.He had to call the samaritans at one point just to keep himself from losing his own mind and I saw him break down because he had to cope with 3 days straight of little sleep and making sure I didn't hurt myself.

When I got home I was still struggling and my best friend here on the request of my boyfriend had to keep an eye on me and make sure I went to the doctors. This meant abandoning his first date with his without explanation.

My mum drove across the country at record speed to look after me and take over when my friend needed sleep.

I am back on the tablets now and slowly getting control of myself. I feel stupid for getting this mess but if anything good has come out of it I am finally getting proper psychiatric help instead of the doctor going here take these meds and nothing else.
 
My boyfriend said that when he was talking to the Samaritans he was asked if he considered leaving me. Apparently when he said that he wouldn't they then asked if it was because I was unstable.He said no it was because he liked me :P.

My boyfriend, my best friend and my mum have done alot for me no only in these last two tough weeks but in the 6 months since I started looking into my illness and got treatment. I have been horrible to them said cruel things and even made them cry but they are still here for me.

When my boyfriend first saw me have a episode he didn't run instead he came here and asked you for help.

So Thankyou to my Mum, my best friend, and my amazing boyfriend, and thank you reddit for helping my boyfriend help me. There is so much support here and I read stories of people in horrible situations and I am happy to see all the support that there is.

tl;dr boyfriend mum and best friend looked after me during a bad month. Big thanks to them and the community for providing support.

I have and always will be addicted to substances because they induce mania, which is what I'm really addicted to.  Starting with this spring semester at college, I decided to go cold turkey on all substances and become a straightedge.  This is the best thing I've done with my life probably in the past few years and I'm still astonished with the positive repercussions.  Last semester and pretty much all through college I struggled socially, academically, and with managing my illness.  Now, I am a double Psychology and Business administration major taking 19 credits as well as involved in 5 clubs/organizations on campus.  I have gotten an 85 or above on every test or assignment thus far and developed strong relationships with a few of my professors.  I have met at least a hundred new people through different social networks and have some girls interested in me again.  In addition, I rekindled relationships with close friends of whom I pulled away from.  I also no longer have a place to call home for complicated reasons, but that pushed me to find a paying job and I ended up (very likely) landing a paid internship in Industrial Organizational Psychology; Most of all, I feel like I have control back in my life.  I am no longer letting manic depression define my life so much as I am defining my life as a person who suffers from it.  With this amount of positive reinforcement, I could NEVER imagine going back to using and I hope this helps people who might be struggling with the issue because a few of my friends told me it helped them with theirs.

I went to my pdoc last week and told her about some recent anxiety I've been experiencing, but generally, my mood has been stable. She asked some more questions about it and suggested I might be having an ""anxiety-based hypomania."" I couldn't help it, I laughed really hard. I brought it up in my support group and NOBODY had ever heard of or experienced such a thing. It seems like she was possibly projecting symptoms on my or something. Now I'm reluctant to tell her anything about daily (""normal"") ups and downs in my mood. I know the difference between having a bad day and having a depressive episode, etc.

Secondly, I read an article recently about the proposed revisions for the DSM--I can't find the original article I read, but [this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/09/us-mental-health-manual?INTCMP=SRCH) one sort of paraphrases it. Basically, they are making changes to include a much broader base of symptoms which could cause an increase in mental illness diagnoses where once the specific symptoms were considered ""normal."" I use quotations for the word normal, as it is a very subjective word. 

Not to mention the fact that we (in the U.S. at least) live in a culture that hands out pharmaceutical medication like it's candy (don't even get me started on the pharmaceutical industry). I'm not implying that people do not have legitimate mental illnesses, but think about how many people you know who are on some type of psychotropic drug. It's very common--perhaps too common?

Hopefully it's alright here, I just felt that this was something that I should bring up to some of the newly diagnosed, or some of the veterans who might not be aware.  I want to talk about some of the parallels between Bipolar and PTSD, and why I think that people need to find out if they need to be treated for both.

I'lll start off with some history about myself without getting too personal.  I was diagnosed with Bipolar when I was 14 years old, and I've been living with it for 10 years.  There was some history of mental illness in my family, but I have also experience a fair amount of personal trauma in my life, and diagnosing me was challenging.  I was originally diagnosed with depression, as I hadn't had a manic episode, however a short stint on Paxil changed that.  From there I had been on many medications, and am now happily on Lithium and Trazadone.  It took a very long time to find a medication balance that I was comfortable with, and even once I did I felt that something still wasn't right.  I felt like my moods were stable, but I was still exhibiting a some of the symptoms that I was informed were related to bipolar.  I was having anxiety issues, I would sometimes have an overactive sex drive, and other times I would be totally numb.  When I went over this with my psychiatrist, he reviewed my personal history with me, and informed me that he thought that I might also have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  I had never heard of it until that point, but he suggested that I seek counseling in addition to the medication.  I've been getting counseling for about 5 years now and it has helped me to deal with the personal issues that were contributing to the Bipolar like symptoms that I was feeling, even with the medication.

In working now with youth at a counseling center, I see a lot of confusion and sometimes misdiagnoses surrounding these two illnesses, and I can understand why.  While attending a therapy group specifically relating to coping with PTSD and going over the symptoms, I saw that a lot of the symptoms between the two are almost identical.  Things like:

* Anxiety
* Overactive sex drive
* Anger/Irritability
* Numbness

The list is a lot longer, but I'm not sure what else to add at the moment, but needless to say it was eye opening for me.

The reason that I'm saying this, I suppose, is because I don't want to see other people taking as long as I did to ask questions and find out if there's something more going on.  I spent my first few years of medical treatment assuming that if I was just supposed to take my medication and that would be the end of it.  I'm not saying that anyone is misdiagnosed, as I tend to trust health care professionals, but there might be something else going on.  I've always felt that it's worthwhile to find out, so you can begin to get the right kind of help right away.  Counseling can be a great side treatment to help deal with the Bipolar regardless, but I feel that it can be more comforting and validating to know exactly why I feel the way I do.  It's nice to give it a name.

Well, that was my two cents on this issues that I don't often see people talk about.  Hopefully I was okay to post this here and hopefully I don't offend, as that's not my intention.

1319601837.0,14,self.BipolarReddit,lpbal,Bipolar Discrimination,15,1,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/lpbal/bipolar_discrimination/,"I don't feel like this is talked about enough by people who are suffering from mental/emotional disorders.  I oftentimes feel prejudice from people around me in a few different ways when it comes to living with bipolar disorder. 

For one, it is pretty offensive when someone describes a whacky, stupid, dramatic, wishy-washy or what-have-you thing, situation, or un-diagnosed person as 'bipolar.'  
Example:  ""Becky got mad at me when I forgot to pick her up at the airport.  She is SO BIPOLAR."" or ""I hate it when the garbage disposal doesn't work. It can be BIPOLAR sometimes.""

People draw their swords when the term 'retarded' is used, whether in reference to a mentally challenged person or not, but no one cares to speak out for other emotional or mental problems.  Not only is it tacky on the part of the person saying it, it is extremely hurtful on my end. 
What do you do when someone says this enough to bother you but you don't want to disclose your diagnoses to them?  



On another, more personal note:
Another thing that I have experienced is, what I feel, discrimination on the part of my former university.  I struggled through 3 years of a bio-medical science degree, un-diagnosed and un-medicated.  I started to realize there was something terribly wrong.  I studied night and day, I never did anything for myself, no friends, no hobbies.  Just school school school, trying to keep up academically.  I worked harder than anyone I know has ever worked at school or their career.  But my grades were terrible, and getting worse and worse, which only made me more stressed and more unstable.  During my last semester of university, I got diagnosed through the school's medical and counseling centers with Bipolar Disorder and began seeing a psychiatrist. I was never advised to take a break from school and get healthy and get my shit together so I could be more successful.  They loaded me up with so many drugs then that I had to drop a class because I slept through a test because of side effects, and made either a D or an F in everything else.  After that semester, I decided I needed to drop out, seek therapy and get stable on my meds.  I needed to take care of myself.  
That was a year and a half ago. I have worked at the same vet clinic for 3 years and have advanced from an assistant, to vet tech, and since dropping out of school and being hired full time, promoted to head vet tech and office manager. I have been stable for 9 months and regularly see a therapist.  I work 55+ hour weeks and I am still ok and have friends and a life now.  I have learned a lot about how to manage this disorder.  But I just feel like I need to finish what I started, and get my degree.  I have now changed my career plans,  and want to be an animal behavior counselor. This entails changing my major to Psychology.  I spoke to the dean of the college and he flatly told me that he believed I want to study this area in order to understand my disorder better, and that he sees people like me trying to change their degree to Psychology all the time.  He sent me to an advisor.  She basically gave me the same vibe, even though I discussed how a background in psychology would be most beneficial to me in doing what I want to do.  She gave me her card and told me to email her with any questions, and then never answered any of my emails.  These two people are the ones who decide whether I get re-admitted to the university and neither seem too eager to give me the time of day.  

What do I do?  Would anyone else consider this discrimination?  Has anyone ever dealt with something like this?  I am not sure how to move on with my education or career with complete resistance on behalf of my school due to my psychiatric history.  I feel like if I was anyone else they would have been happy to help me get back into school (and take my tuition dollars), but because of my condition I was treated like I am completely crazy and out of touch with reality. 



How do you deal when treated differently or dismissively because of your diagnoses?

I thought i'd share my story and experiment on creating a non-fiction piece of my real-life events leading up th an 18 day stay in a NYC hospital last year.

*here's part 1 if you missed it.

*When Will It End? My life in New York - This panic attack. Over? 
*Not yet. There’s too much to do before I die. I had about 15 dollars in my pocket. 
*I was travelling in a Toronto train station when the symptoms began to take hold. 
*I thought it was the two cups of black coffee and the 8 vodkas the night before - pushing me into overdrive. 
*I was definitely abusing my brain, but there was something else there, and I couldn’t explain, understand, or describe why it was different. 
*I spent two hours in transit on the train, mostly locking myself in the bathroom, holding my head in my hands, dry heaving, calling friends long distance and trying to ask them for help in some way. 
*I was in a different kind of panic. I told my best friend I thought I had a mental illness, and she said ""there is nothing wrong with you, you are in complete control of your feelings, just breathe, and understand that you can control this on your own."" 
*Over the course of the next couple months or so, I realized that I could not just magically control these attacks. 
*I needed a doctor of some kind. I soon learned that a milligram of Xanax or four ounces of courage would put a stop to the shaking, mixed fear of death and dry hurling for two hours in an Amtrak restroom. 
*When will it end? I kept thinking. After I find love? After I make my movie? After I get some sleep? And morning after morning, I’d wake up at 5, 4, 3 AM shaking and immediately shoot four ounces of anything, and turn on some kind of media to distract me from the anxious thoughts. 
*It was very surreal and at some point got peaceful. it was a dangerous cycle to get used to. First it was Vodka, then Whisky, than anything that would stop that constant repetition of that verse of that song in my head that kept pounding and shaking me towards the paranoia of my inevitable demise, 
*or the song that reminded me of that person that broke my heart, that I can't stop fucking comparing to myself. And sometime after that, I started smoking pot.

*
*
*


*Part 2

*I was lifted into an oasis of humility. I started to get that peace and love was so simple, and staring us all in the face. 
*Especially on a particularly crowded C train. It was obvious to me. 
*It didn’t seem obvious to the rest of them. Nothing really phased me for a while. The nausea was gone. 
*The suppression of the urge to order white pizza at 1 AM was quickly overcome. 
*I was so stoned once, around this time last year, I ordered pizza with my friend Wesley and the delivery guy, little Mexican dude, just started laughing at me with no remorse 
*because my little apartment basically erupted a thick spreading cloud of smoke into the hallway. 
*He just laughed. And laughed, and I was trying to do that whole ""i'm not stoned"" act, but it didn’t work. 
*He knew, he saw. I was baked out of the latest engineered organic tree of wisdom anyone might ever have been. And that was good pizza.
	*Crazy. Yeah. I’m crazy. I told my psychiatrist that my mom stole my Xanax just to get more. 
*I learned about Pharmacy’s. I learned that you can take the same prescription to several different pharmacy’s to obtain the controlled substance before your dose changes in their system. 
*At some point in January, the weed, the Xanax, and the outrageous amount of vodka and whisky I consumed gradually stopped helping me sleep. 
*And when I couldn’t sleep, I’d watch reruns of friends, or frantically ease into some meaningless, meditative media that made me feel that everything was going to be okay.
•I was back. I was back to waking up at 3 or 4 am, unable to sleep, anxious out of my mind, and drunk before sunrise. 
*I had no clue how bad this was going to get. A good friend told me it was ""just a phase"".

Last week, I was diagnosed with being Bipolar. He didn't say much more than that (my psychiatrist) and didn't tell me what kind it was. I'm going Wednesday to get on medication. He told me he wants to put me on an anti-depressant and mood stabilizer.

I've been reading about mood stabilizers, and I don't want. They apparently are the medicines that control mania, right?

I don't think I have ""mania"" in the typical sense. I know they think I do, but I don't. 

When I have a good mood, I have a good mood. I have confidence in myself. I feel happy. Sometimes I just feel euphoric. I feel the presence of love and just want to bask in it. I feel closer to God (when I'm depressed, I'm atheist). I'm just happy and enjoy every second of life. I get more things done, I'm more creative. 

There's a line from a movie that describes perfectly my attitude toward life:

""Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst... And then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain and I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life""

Now tell me, why would I want to get rid of this? These feelings make my life worth living. If this is ""mania"" then my mania isn't harmful. I don't gamble, or do drugs, or have casual sex. I just feel awesome.

I don't want a mood stabilizer that gets rid of that and just makes me feel ""average"" emotion 24/7.

I just want to get rid of the crippling depression and suicidal thoughts that happen 2 or 3 times a week.

A. I don't think I have mania, but if I do, why would I want rid of it? It does no more.

The common wisdom seems to be that exercise is a magical cure for depression and anxiety, that it's essential for people with mood disorders, that anyone who isn't lazy or has self-control should be exercising. But, for me, exercise is incredibly problematic.

First, when I exercise *regularly* I don't just get not-depressed I get hypomanic. An exercise session leaves me feeling jittery and it'll often fuck up my sleep schedule. This is all bad because it means I'm on the cusp of disaster all the time.

Second, the act of exercising, in the moment, is very anxiety-inducing for me. I'm very unnerved by exercise in gyms or by things like running in public. I am also not comfortable exercising at home if my SO is around. I don't think it's a body image issue because I'm ok with nudity and I'm neither noticeably under nor overweight for a 30 something at 5'11 170.

Last, I find it to be a miserable activity, torturous, bleak and mind-numbing.

It's to the point where I get angry because it makes me feel like I'm crazy for not understanding this exercise ""secret"". I genuinely do not understand how others can bring themselves to do this together, for fun, in groups, and to the effect of feeling good.

I never considered the possibility that I could be bipolar, even though my sister had a diagnosis for bipolar 1 since she was a young adult.

The last four years have been really rough and I have been in therapy for all of it. I finally switched therapists thinking that things just were not improving at all. I always feel exhausted, weepy, and angry, occasionally getting unwanted thoughts about hurting myself. I have a lot of anxiety in social and crowd situations and my confidence comes and goes. The new therapist asked me if I ever considered that I could be bipolar. And I immediately said no, and then claimed I hated labels, and then went home and read a book on bipolar.

Fast forward a couple of months and I finally make the commitment to go to a shrink and within an hour the shrink diagnoses me as bipolar. She asks me lots of things I never connected with my moods, just thought of them as little quirks of mine. Things like organizing and liking numbers like when the clock turns 12:34. Things like my cray cray phobia of frogs. Things like oh, the three or four times I went on hot mess sexual binges or shopping extremes. I had no idea feeling expansive and full could be a result of a mood disorder. I totally got that the part where I can't stop crying and I make my loved ones miserable is.

So, I'm slowly building up Lamictal in my system (just over a week now). I don't notice much change yet. The only thing I've noticed so far is I can finally sleep without waking up every couple of hours. I have a lot of hope that this will help me function in my inner life. My outer life has always worked okay, its the inside that causes me anguish and makes my husband nuts.

All of that said, I have some questions I hope you guys can help me with:

If you take Lamictal, how long did it take you to notice an effect?
Did you tell people in your friend circle about your diagnosis?
Did you read any books to learn how to cope with bipolar?

I have this weird combo feeling of relief that I may be able to finally do something about my emotions and exhaustion coupled with trepidation about what this now means about me.

I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. I made the stupid of mistakes of drinking while on meds (mood stabilizer, and an anti depressant).

I can't forgive myself for this night, and I've taken full responsibility for the night. I'm wondering, though, is it all my fault?

I was drinking with my then manager, and he pulled me to a separate room and told me, ""if you don't stop acting so cute I'm going to kiss you"". I dodged his kisses and even apologized saying I don't want to. He got mad at me cus I continued to ""act cute"" and stormed off. I wasn't taking off my clothes. I wasn't touching him sexually. I was just a happy drunk. anyways, I don't know if it's my bpd or what, but I feel really bad when people get mad at me. I hate when someone is upset with me, and I will do so much to make them happy (this time to the extreme). I ended up following him into his room, apologizing (for what?), hugging him, and I ended up having sex with him.

I cheated on my husband that night. My biggest regret. I often think about killing myself because I simply cannot forgive myself. Don't worry, I won't do it. I haven't even cut myself in months. That night will always haunt me. I wasn't even attracted to the guy. during the sex I was even turned off. it was like sympathy sex or something. I felt bad cus he was mad at me so I did it? I take responsibility for this, but lately I've been wondering, was I manipulated? The manager knew of my disorder. He knew I was on meds. He knew I was drunk. I hate what I did, and I just cannot forgive myself. I don't know how to move on :\.

 I deny myself because I do not know what I am anymore. The question that stands beneath it all, to be answered by the heart: 
Is what I feel inside, more real than what I touch ? Do we live by what we see, or by what we don't see ?

Gaining wisdom, does this entail growing fond of the world, or growing to hate it ? If its the things that you don't see, that truly matter, that transcend time, what is there to love in this age ?

Things that are created have a time-table, was love created, or was it (t)here, from the beginning ? Can it be written off ?

So, I've been dealing with bipolar II for about 13 years now (I'm 25). I've been on every medication in the book, have dealt with a lot of terrible stuff, etc etc. I've been on Lamictal (Lamotringine) for about four-ish years now, and it's working great, for the part. I still have have residual mood/depression problems, but I'm working on fixing that. 

So, in college about three years ago, I was prescribed Adderall to help with school, writing anxiety especially, and it helped with my mood so, so much. In fact, it was the only thing that could snap me out a depression. Right now I'm having issues with my life, mood and job, and I'm interested in getting another prescription for Adderall to help. I know it will help me and I also know my limits, because this can be an addictive drug. 

Here's my problem - I haven't been to a psychiatrist in years. My family doctor was able to prescribe the Lamitical no problem, but they were wary about adding Adderall, and suggested I go see a psych.

I'm worried that I'm going to go to a psychiatrist and they are a) going to accuse me of being a drug seeker even though I know myself and know it helps, b) going to unearth a lot of mental problems I am not interested in dealing or c) bully me into taking an anti-depressant or another drug when I have absolutely no desire to do so.

Basically, all I want to do is walk into a doctor's office and plead my case, and walk out with drugs without having to drag up 13 years of misery and high school torture for no reason other than to make me miserable. That's why I've been avoiding them.  

Could anyone maybe offer some advice? Have you had a good experience with your doctor prescribing you the drug? Is there a certain way you discussed it?

I'm bipolar I, currently taking lamictal, lithium, and haldol. I've been taking lamictal since I was diagnosed last summer and I've been manic or hypomanic for most of this year. Prior to last summer I had the ""typical"" mood pattern - mostly normal or depressed, briefly hypomanic. 

I really, honestly think that lamictal is making me worse. I've been told that it's very activating and is a good antidepressant, and I've even been told that my doctors would not have me on it without lithium to ""balance things out."" Well, I'm not balanced out! I am a goddamn rapid cycling hypomanic/kinda manic mess. *And every time we've decreased the lamictal I've felt better,* but my doctor does not want to reduce it further (I am taking 200mg). 

I'd like to know if anyone has been in a similar situation. I tend to react weirdly to drugs - four atypicals caused me to be more manic. If no one talks me out of it I'm going to insist that my doctor either helps me taper down from lamictal or adds another anti manic mood stabilizer (I'm thinking depakote). I think it makes more sense to reduce the drugs I'm already on before adding new ones though.

EDIT: So I called my doctor and left a really long message about the lamictal and depakote. He called me back, explained the PCOS risk with depakote, and agreed to reduce the lamictal dose.

As far as my music goes (I'm an aspiring musician) I'm doing well. Things are taking off in a great direction. 

But then on the other hand, I'm extremely lonely. I have only a couple of friends, and none of them will talk to me about my bipolar (not that I blame them.. It is a daunting subject..). I've been talking to a fellow redditor lately, but thats still a distant thing. 

I really need someone here for me who I can talk to face to face and hug when I'm feeling shitty and all of that. I have really been having a hard time with my swinging. And I feel lonely constantly, even when I'm manic. It really sucks. 

The only person in the entire world that I feel loved by is my little brother. He's six and he's amazing and such a cool kid. But he loves me because he hasn't become disillusioned with me yet. He doesn't know about my struggles and so he thinks I'm someone he can look up to... But he will not be that way forever. 

I just want to feel loved by someone who doesn't love me because they don't know any different. Is that too much to ask? It's not that I don't appreciate my brother's love for me, I really do. It has kept me alive many times. But at the same time, I really wish someone would love me, really love me, just for who I am. And no one does. And it's pure agony. 

Every girl who I have loved has left me (even when they all promised they wouldn't). And my entire family does not understand what is wrong with me (and they may love me, but I don't feel it).

People say mean things and I get pissed off. Then I use negative coping skills and do self-destructive things (someone called me a fu%$ing idiot on reddit so I went and engaged in self-destructive sexual behavior.)

I'm so agitated by external stimuli. When someone's opening a wrapper, when someone makes too much noise, I just want to hit them.

Couples drive me crazy. I hate seeing their happiness. I hate that I will probably never find a long term relationship because I am so messed up in the head.

My job and school performance are suffering and I can't concentrate at all. I've backed myself into a corner.

I work at a psychiatric hospital, so I feel like I can't reveal my disability to anyone because they will think I'm incompetent or unworthy and then take my second year internship away from me (currently in the first year of internship.)

My parents piss me off to no end with their judgmental comments and hovering.

I forget everything. My short term memory is gone.

I hate how it seems like people are so hateful toward gay people. I didn't choose to be a gay man, I hate it when people say ""it's a choice."" Believe me, I wouldn't have selected it. The whole ""sin is sin."" ""hate the sin love the sinner"" sh%$ pisses me off. It's patronizing.

All I want to do is stay in the library and hide. I just want to isolate myself. I can't stand people, I can't stand being in public.

Lately I feel like I'm either agitated and pissed off at the world or extremely depressed and hating myself and my life.

My medications don't work well and I can't get an appointment to see my psychiatrist till the end of April.

It's hard for me to make friends because I'm so socially awkward and I guess people don't want to embrace some of the bizarre things I say. The things I say USUALLY aren't socially inappropriate, but I guess they are usually off topic and considered ""abnormal.""

I just wish I could be balanced and settled. I wish I could be performing well and well organized. I wish that every day I didn't feel like I screwed everything up and my life is over (at 28 years old.)

Right now, I'm scared.

We talk about it, what we can do, ways I can get him in the mood, and even little blue pills aren't helping right now. 

In the past, I've had encounters with people who I trusted not to give me diseases, but I wouldn't go as far as to call it a relationship.

Bipolar 1 Disorder, Most Recent Episode Mixed, Moderate

Found this on paperwork from my psychiatrist visit yesterday. My lack of sleep seems to have caught up with me (4.25 hours average for the past 38 days according to my mood tracker) and finally brought on some almost-pure hypomania. I forgot to mention way too many things to my psych while I was there because of it, though. Ah well, I'll write things down for next time I talk to him. Prescribed Neurontin for sleep, upped the Lamictal to 150 for 2 weeks, then 200. Kind of want to hang out with this hypomania for a bit, debating putting off taking the Neurontin for a few more days... It may not even help, nothing else really has, but it's the last resort before antipsychotics. I just feel so relatively okay. D: I know that sleeping will knock me right back down into depression.

That said, when my girlfriend and I fight, I have the usual reactions most people with bi polarity experience. The issue is that when things get out of hand, I become ""feral."" I will sit/lay on the floor, find a corner, and curl into a little ball. I am typically unresponsive and physically lash out at anybody who touches me or I feel is threatening me. My motor skills are affected sometimes, as well. I also tend to forget most, if not all, of the episode. These can last anywhere from ten minutes to hours. 

I recognize a lot of the fighting could be avoided if I had better control over my temper, but these feral states are worrisome. I've brought them up with my doctors though they kinda dismiss it as part of my mania even though I do not feel like they are related (aside from them both being brought on by the same stimuli). Does anybody have any suggestions as to what's happening or how possibly even how to avoid it? 

Before I post this, I want to let you guys know how much this subreddit has helped me. I always feared I was lying to everybody, including myself, about the state of my head but a lot of the things I'd written off as me being a petulant child are being mirrored in posts here. You guys have really helped me make some major strides in my life, even if you don't know it!

I would really appreciate anything you might be able to tell me.

My daughter is turning 10, and since she was a baby I knew she was different. She didn't like to be cuddled, and she screamed a LOT.  She is super smart, talked in full sentences at 8 months old, but had a VERY short fuse. As soon as she was 1 1/2 we knew we would need to get her help - she screamed for hours about getting dressed in the morning, getting changed for bed, brushing teeth, the length of her sleeves, being at the store, being at home.  Most of these tantrums lasted for at least 3 hours or more and involved a lot of violent kicking and hitting.  When she was 3 we tried to get help from the family mental health unit (Canada) and our family doctor, and were told it was sibling rivalry since we had just had a second baby. This did not explain the night terrors that would awaken us with screams almost every night that she could not awaken from for 30 minutes or more.  We dealt with this with patience and we bend over backwards to help her cope. We live in a very expensive area but I stay home with her and even homeschool her part of the year so that each school year she can start going gradually rather than jumping in suddenly.  She has social problems so school does seem to help with that.

Fast forward 6 years.  She has extreme anxiety, constant unhappiness, still cannot get dressed with hours of tears and screaming, and so much frustration with everything she's doing that we have difficulty doing anything together. We can't take her anywhere without a blowup, and unless she's watching a movie or playing video games, she's hyper and making random sounds.  It's difficult for us because we know how smart she is, and yet she can't seem to sit down for a minute to just enjoy what is happening to her at the moment.  We start to see a cycle - a week of relatively good behavior and stable mood, followed by a week of screaming and insane laughter.

We finally get a new family doctor, he gets us quickly to a pediatric psychologist who refuses to diagnose her but puts her on risperidone, which improves her mood and stability dramatically.  Unfortunately, at age 7-8 it has a side effect of having her start developing breasts early and we decided to take her off of it.  She seems to remain very stable for 6 months, and almost 'normal' or whatever people define as normal. She takes a break from the psychologist for a little bit, and some of the stuff she does just seems more like regular kid stuff, although now reflecting back probably not.  She doesn't understand appropriate sexual boundaries with her siblings, starts swearing at me when she's in trouble, but is able to get dressed without screaming and actually enjoys going to school.  The sexual stuff isn't extreme, just too obsessed with seeing everybody naked.

Then we hit 9 and she begins spiraling into depression again. She begins to sometimes say she wants to die. We get referred to another pediatric psychologist who supposedly specializes in this kind of thing.  We spend a year going back and forth every two months (because he's super busy), where he spends about 10 minutes with her and decides she has ODD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder.  I tell him I doubt it because she doesn't have any of the risk factors - she comes from a stable home with two other perfectly well-adjusted siblings, and it doesn't explain any of her other issues. It just defines her as disobedient, which she is to the extreme. He puts her on fluoxetine (Prozac), which barely does anything for 6 months and then gradually does nothing. We cannot increase her dose because it is as high as it can be for a child. We do an assessment, which says she's typical for ADHD. She's beginning to have trouble at school for the first time, mostly because she is having inappropriate conversations with groups of boys at school, then getting teased for it and bullied.  

So I go do some reading about ADHD, and I found this page: http://www.healthlinkbc.ca/kb/content/special/ty6938.html
She falls into everything on the left column, and nothing on the right.  I talk to her clinician who is our go-between with the psychologist, and they respond by telling me no that is not even something to consider, and moving my next appointment date two months farther into the future (which means we had to wait 4 months instead of 2).

I am heading back to our family doctor who is awesome and I'm sure I'll get more results from him, including better medication.  But I want advice first from people who will understand my daughter better than I can. I have read that when ADHD medication is given to bipolar patients, the result can be disastrous. I want to know if I am off-base to be concerned about it being a possibility so young because  I have heard that pediatric bipolar is controversial. Did anyone here have these issues when they were kids?  Do you have any advice for me, especially about medication?  Abilify and seroquel were going to be the next possible medications for her. Thanks for reading this long thing!

TLDR: My 10 year old daughter has struggled with cycles of depression (even sounding suicidal) and hyperactivity with crazy laughter since she was little. She can be obsessed with sexual topics. She can sometimes be extraordinarily helpful and then the rest of the time she is the most disobedient child ever.  I have been struggling to help her and fight through the maze of the medical support available to us.  They say it's possibly ODD and ADHD but I have doubts.

In the morning when the sun is fully in the sky, I start to drink champagne.
 It’s been a long time since I slept, she is fully manic again.
Sometime in the long dreadful nite she accuses me of things, ravages my short comings, curls into a ball on the carpet, and paces up and down while she tells me a story. She sings to me and makes me laugh and cry. We fight and I accuse her of not holding herself down, but she’s manic and can’t.
For someone who just couldn’t stay that last long minute, I find her suddenly sitting at my feet...we’re watching the dawn. We take particular note of the birds.
She tries for a long time to tell me in order to build a bridge; we are a long way from home now. Honesty so difficult in bipolar, the gift, the undercover guise. It’s only a way of returning. It’s how she comes back, I know.
Then I can cry for her illness and then she will tell me Mum it’s really nothing. Something’s wrong, something will always be wrong. We’ll do this the rest of our lives.
I can hardly keep staring at the sunlight hitting the carport roof. Compelling and blinding. I too am trying to come down. I am devastated and rebuilt all at once as again I come to understand.
I hear people driving off to work, taking routine care of life, busying themselves in a perfectly acceptable day. Not a life like that here. 
Sister is sleeping in my bed upstairs. She stayed with us as long as she could.
There is a circle where everyone holds hands and waves them abstractedly in the air. 
Then I turn to myself as I often have and cry deeply for the sheer event of our peace and love.

It runs in my family (it's been debilitating for my father and his mother in the past), but i thought they were just diagnosing as an excuse for what a crazy teenager i was.

I straightened out my life for the most part and i seemed well adjusted for a short year. Then the depression came out of no where and it hit me like a ton of bricks. I powered through it and i started feeling good again, in a way. I had energy again. I now realize this was when i became manic. I could never really sleep, i always had racing thoughts. I was extremely compulsive (especially when it came to sex) and it put me in a lot of high risk situations, i did things i'm not proud of.

It just keeps coming back. Years 16-18 i thought it was a misdiagnosis, but now i can look back and see the distinct changes in my mood and behavior. I'm currently self medicating with adderal, booze, and weed because without the adderal, i can't get out of bed, and without the booze and weed, the adderal just keeps me up all night. I haven't seen my therapist in about 8 months, i want to call her again but i just... I don't know. Do i want to wallow in my self-pity? Right now it just feels like the only thing i can do.

This is my first time on this sub... I don't really know what to say. This is the first time i've really talked about my bipolar disorder. I'm scared to tell about my self medicating, i'm afraid of being judged or being sent away.

I had a late onset of bipolar. My symptoms started at age 29, I already had my degree and a lot of established relationships. I am now 40 and my quality of life has slowly, but surely, been degrading steadily since it all started.

My old friends are way ahead of me in almost all aspects; they have a family, most of them are two steps (or more) above entry level jobs and so on. When I meet with them, I feel so apart that tradition really hasn’t been able to keep us together. We almost have nothing in common anymore, even when I am without symptoms.

So I’ve been establishing new relationships since, say, age 37. My new friends really are 10 or more years younger. When we get together for a coffee or whatever they just talk about reality TV shows and constantly stay quiet for lengthy periods of time during which they are all into their smartphones using Facebook or WhatsApp. Every time I try to have a reasonable conversation about any topic (life, feelings, relationships, the future, the past, music…) no one follows or answers anything. So in short, I guess the intellectual level is pretty low, but they’re all I have! And I feel grateful for having them. They care about me, but I feel so alone when I'm with them that many times I just come back home and watch the same movies over and over.

But, then again, slowly but surely, they’re growing apart… getting better jobs and establishing with SO’s. Also, when I met them I still had a sparkly personality so I guess I was cool and fun to be with, which is now shadowed because of a permanent state of anhedonia. I feel they’re starting to figure out I’m not fun anymore, and who can blame them. I’m really not passionate about anything anymore… I literally have no desires for anything! This has led me to desperation and, even being unstable, I requested my psych that we do something. We lowered the stabilizers a while ago but I don’t feel any change.

I first received an unofficial diagnosis of manic depression about three years ago from my psychiatrist. 

I had been treated for major depression for about five years prior and tried several different types of medication and nothing worked. After an in-depth conversation with my psychiatrist, I started taking Lamictal, because the things I told her about my drug use, excessive spending, and lack of control lead her to believe that I may not just be depressive. When I took the medication the right way, it worked. (I say the ""right way"" because for a long period of time I would take it sporadically, which just made everything worse...) Everyone in my life noticed a big difference in my moods. I still went through mood swings, but they were more manageable. My psychiatrist said that I am more than likely Bipolar Type II. 

I have not been medicated since March. I felt perfectly normal for a long time, the most stable I have felt probably in my whole life. Things have recently taken a turn for the worst, as I am currently depressed for the first time in a long time.

I apologize for the lengthy background information, but I felt that it may be relevant to this question.

With all of that being said, my family does not believe that I am actually bipolar. Their reasoning is that no one else in my family has been diagnosed as being bipolar, so there is no possible way I could be. 

I personally believe that my mother has manic depression, but I don't believe she will ever see a psychiatrist to find out. My father has depression and my grandparents on both sides have all had psychiatric issues (panic attacks, anxiety, depression). So I definitely have a history of mental illness in my family, but no one has had the diagnosis.

Sometimes I feel like I don't really have it and that maybe my doctor was incorrect, like my family says.

In case I am incorrect about my mother and if no one else in my family has manic depression, is it still possible for me to have it? Could I be misdiagnosed?

We've been together for almost 7 years (no kids) but I'm at a loss now.


Context: We're basically broke. I work full time and make good money but we've racked up so much debt we're BARELY breaking even. It's incredibly tight (ramen for lunch and dinner tight) but it's survivable. For him this is unbearable - he says it feels like prison especially since he can't work right now and if he could work it wouldn't be nearly so tight.


SitRep: He's INCREDIBLY depressed. He's been suicidal for ages - to the point where he's picturing ways to do it in his head most of the day. He won't let me take him to the mental health ER in the area because he does't want to be hospitalized and ""it won't help"". (I'm also 90% sure he'd flat out lie and pretend to be fine if I forced him in...) I'm seeing him fade away day by day. Before I could see him fighting - looking for something to distract himself...now he just sits...I can't even begin to describe the terror I feel when I look in his eyes now.


Question - Most of the pain he's feeling stems from his parents lack of interest/involvement in his treatment. They view this like addiction (which they have some experience with) - they want him to go away, ""get help"" and come back when he's ""normal"". We can't get them to understand what's going on and they've been very clear they don't want to know.
As a result he feels abandoned and unloved. My family has been incredible but they're not local - and he's ashamed to tell the few people we consider (loosly) friends.


What got through to you when you felt alone? What can I say/do/get others to do to show him there are more people that care about him than he realizes? How can I show him that while his parents are his parents they do NOT need to be his only source of support and love?

I am in touch with his doctors and have full access to his records etc...I'm more looking for little things/ideas/phrasings/anything that I can do to help him feel less alone.

Dear god, I feel awful. It isn't just that I'm depressed, it's that it came on *so suddenly* - literally over night - after a period of feel pretty fantastic. I was so happy - I had come down enough that the really bad manic symptoms were gone, but I still had the elevated mood.

I wish my doctor warned me. On the other hand, if she had warned me I might not have taken my meds. Has this happened to anyone else? Am I going to crash every time I come down from mania? WTF do I do about this?

I can't take an antidepressant. I have had pretty bad experiences with SSRIs and welbutrin, and I don't think this is the best time to experiment with older antidepressants (although if you can recommend something I'll ask my doc about it). My doctor told me to take 10mg of ritalin in the morning to help get out of bed, and it has improved my mood a lot.

Who would have thought, synthetic cocaine improves my mood.

The really weird thing is that I get kind of manicy at night. My brain starts moving faster, I'm happier, I start random projects (like late night baking). Which is kind of nice, because then I have early morning food.

I'm just looking for some advice, experiences, and support. I'm trying to feel out what is ""normal"" for bipolar 1. I also want to know if anyone else has used ritalin (with their doctors prescription) to improve mood and help with a lack of motivation.

EDIT: I think it will be helpful if I make a list of ""bright sides."" So, on the bright side:

* I've been cycling rapidly, so this might not last long

* I feel motivated to work out

* I am getting some sleep (too much..)

* I can eat again

* my sex drive hasn't vanished

* I have the support of my family, friends, boyfriend, and psychiatrist

* one of my teachers has already been very accommodating. I've been consistently late to his class and he seems understand 

* My school recognizes bipolar disorder as a mental health problem which justifies accommodations such as flexible due dates (which I really really need right now)

* I feel a bit better today than yesterday

Here's another quick update for any of you that are interested.

When last we followed my story, my wife was in the hospital for bipolar w/ Psychotic tenancies.  Not much has changed.

I had a meeting with her psychiatrist yesterday to get an update.  The hallucinations are still strong, but he feels that he is starting to see cracks in them, and is starting to challenge her on them.  One new thing that concerned him is that she told him that her 'soul-mate' has been sending her messages in books and magazines.

However, her medication seems to be kicking in. He feels that she is coming off the manic state, and the delusions are beginning to weaken.

This week she had 6 hour passes available from the hospital, and for the weekend she will be getting day passes.

However, she is still convinced she will be leaving me after she is out of the hospital.  When she talks to me, it is immediate.  When she talks to her doc, it is apparently not.  And, according to her mom, she has had discussions with me about custody of the kids (I will maintain custody).  Strangely enough, I don't recall that conversation :-)

The doc talked to me about overnight passes for next weekend, and my response was that as we don't have a spare room in the house, if she isn't comfortable with the fact we would be sharing the same room, I don't want her to have an overnight pass.  He took note of that, and took the overnight pass off the table for the time being.

He said that she will be in the hospital for a minimum of two more weeks.

I've seen a counselor once now, and it went well.  I've got another appointment this week.  Basically at this point I seem to be out of crisis mode, and am more in maintaining the household.  I'm currently looking for daycare for my girls as I'm going to have to return to work soon.

So I quit drinking a month or so ago, even if it was just socially to begin with. But you know - a whole bunch of mid-20 somethings drinking can get intense. And though it's greatly improved my life and I'm proud of my sobriety, I don't know what to say when I don't order a beer or cocktail. How do you come up with a reasonable, viable explanation besides saying, ""I'm bipolar and lose my shit when I drink""? I never really realized how many situations involve alcohol at some level. What do I do when someone places a drink before me or during cocktail mixers? 

**Update**: Thanks everyone for all the encouragement and advice!! I feel really positive and your stories inspire me.  But I have a related question: will the ""I just don't drink"" work with friends who have been close for a long time?  I can see the blunt statement working in new situations and with acquaintances, but do I have an obligation to say something about the sudden stop to friends I used to drink with socially? A lot of the explanations (ex: DD, losing weight, I'm already hungover) don't have staying power, if that makes sense.

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z4c4l/update_wife_39_told_me_45_today_she_was_leaving/

Long story short, yesterday my wife told me she was leaving me for an ex-manager she last saw a decade ago (other than possibly glimpsing him across the room while we were on vacation a week ago).  He has no knowledge of this.

It turns out that she has no way to contact him.

Today it turned in to that she is a princess, that he has been orchestrating her life for the past two decades, and now he is on his way to our place to pick her up.

We also have two daughters, 6 and 3.

If you want the rest of the gory details, follow the links above.  Many of the comments in the threads suggested that this sounded like it may be a manic episode, and on doing some (basic) reading on it, it sounds very close.  However, I am not a doctor, and my goal is to get her to one for a proper diagnosis of whatever is going on.

At this point, she is confident in her beliefs, and is not willing to seek medical help voluntarily.  She freely acknowledges that this must sound crazy to everyone else.

I am going to be trying to make my initial contact with the local mental health authority tomorrow to start talking to them and to find out how they feel I should proceed.

What I would love to hear is any suggestions on how to convince her to see a doctor, and how to try to cope with this in the immediate term.

Should I be seeking to get an involuntary assessment at this point?  She has not appeared to be threatening to anyone, or to herself.  When I've told her I'm worried about her mental health she shrugs it off saying she knows it sounds crazy, but she is not offended or insulted by it. 

She had been diagnosed with depression after our oldest daughter was born, but refused treatment for it.  This is the first time she has ever gone over the top like this.

Last month I received an unexpected letter in the mail saying that due to 3 F's, I was kicked out of school. I had one legitimate F from my first semester, but the other two F's were a mystery to me. One of them was supposed to be an Incomplete that I was working on in the summer (It turned out to be because of a miscommunication when I was going through a depressive episode) and the other one was supposed to be an A (that was fixed easily)!

This meant I no longer had insurance and no financial support except for my part time 4-8 hr/wk job. I went through several emotions when I received this news. The first was relief because I struggle in school. But then I felt like a wreck.

So here's what I did:
* I immediately called my county's behavioral health department and set up an appointment to see a counselor and psychiatrist so I don't run out of meds.
* I contacted my university's Office of Disability Services and my Graduate Director to see how I can get back in.
* I finished all the required work for the F that was supposed to be an I
* I appealed to the department who appealed to the Graduate School on my behalf (that's how the appeals process works at my uni) and I'm going to class now
* My appeal was granted and I'm currently appealing for my financial aid.

Good right?

Despite this, I still felt awful. I spent most of my time in bed and unable to get up. I kept having to call off work because of how awful I felt and how little energy I had (it was a retail job). I eventually was asked to resign :(

I'm happy that I'm back in school, but I'm not really feeling happy about life or myself in general. I feel like a failure. Here's what I wrote to a friend the other day:

&gt; I hate myself. Why do I have to be the way I am? I go against the grain of society and life. I'm not fit for success in this world. I'm doomed to repeated cyclical failure. I see the hole in my path and I still fall into it. How am I ever supposed to live a good life? I'm always going to fuck up. This will never stop happening. I keep writing these appeals and I say I'm better now and this time I won't fail, but how can I ensure that? How do I know that I won't relapse into acute depression in 2 months? My managers have a point. What will prevent this from happening again? You know what? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. When the time comes, I'll just hate myself again, I'll just become unmotivated and depressed. I'll just regret the fact that I was born and stay in bed. I'll want nothing more than to end my life. But the guilt and the fear of doing so stop me. Yeah I can attribute these feelings to my illness and seek help. But when does it stop? When does the misery end? When do I stop failing enough to be successful so that I can be content? I just keep screwing it up over and over. What happens when I can't appeal for my money because I got fired because I'm incompetent at my worst times? How do I keep a job? How do I get a job after losing another one? Or how do I get a job after losing a string of them? And if I keep holding my employers hostage with my disability and the Americans with Disabilities Act, I just become a burden. Then what purpose do I have on this earth if I have to force someone to give me the resources I need to live with no proper compensation because I am and I will forever be sick? That's what has happened at [place of work]. I'm costing them money now. I'm a burden. That's why I must quit.

Really, the only drug that has consistently ""worked"" for me has been Lithium. I've been on it ever since then, and every attempt to switch to another medication has been a failure. The only problem is that it turns me into a damn mindless automaton devoid of all important memories of the past, appropriate emotions (it's so hard just to feel excited, happy or even sad) and missing all the personality traits and quirks that defined the person I was before. 

I was a fairly good student before I was on it, I had a sense of humor, intellectual pursuits I could enjoy figuring out and understanding. Now I'm a high-school dropout on disability, I can't read books anymore because I'm so forgetful and unfocused, I can't really enjoy the hobbies I once had because I'm too stupid to follow or understand anything even a little complex, I feel like someone has taken an ice-cream scoop to my brain. I am a shell of the person I was/could be and my wasted potential haunts me everyday. I welcome depression because then I could actually feel like a human being again. 

I'm beginning to work with my psychiatrist to reduce my lithium dose, it's been reduced from 1,200 to 1,050 mg. I can think just a TINY bit more clearly, but still feel empty emotionally. I'm worried that I can never find the right levels of intellectual and emotional clarity along with mental stability. I'm worried that I can either be a stable drugged-up robot who can't get a G.E.D or hold down a job and is forever dependent on disability, or be able to be myself but end up dead or in jail because of my bipolar. Think I'd prefer the latter, I just can't see  living life anymore without being able to actually live.

I've always wanted to be a filmmaker, have a longterm relationship, be financially independent etc. Whenever these things start to happen, sooner or later the oversensitivity guillotine is triggered by some incident and everything collapses: I quit jobs/relationships/ projects and go into hiding (&amp; hospital a couple of times).

It isn't just an 'oh I'm so sensitive' issue - when it gets triggered I go cold and panicy, selfhate roars up from the deep; it feels like a personality collapse; existence is a horrible joke and I should immediately give up on everything &amp; end my life.

When I do recover, negative flashbacks continually attack me from the moment I wake up, making it difficult to rebuild confidence and try things over again.

It won't cure you of your highs and lows, but it can certainly help you relate to them in a more useful way than what you're probably doing now.
 


Shinzen Young (a meditation teacher) has this equation that I've found helpful. Pain (both physical and emotional, i.e sadness, depression etc) * resistance= suffering. In short: pain*resistance= suffering.  So basically, if you reduce your resistance to your pain, it will decrease how much you're bothered by it. I know, being sad/depressed and not being as bothered by it as you're now probably seems foreign and ludicrous, but right now, I'm feeling quite  a lot of sadness/depression at my solar plexus for example (sensations that is) and it doesn't bother me that much. Sure, it sucks, but it doesn't grip me as much as it used to and I can manage it, even though it's not particulary pleasant. And it doesn't make my do anything I might regret later (for example a suicide attempt). I'm not saying you'll reach this point instantly when you start to meditate, but it can certainly help you become a bit more aware of your thoughts and feelings so that you might be able to steer of a mood swing coming etc.



The resources I'd look into is basicmindfulness.org and at Shinzen's youtube channels (just put in Shinzen Young in youtube and you'll find them). His teachings are technical but it's worth getting through.



Check out /r/meditation and here's a video series where you can check out how Shinzen Young works with intense emotions:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FrWSDBsy14



You learn meditative *skills*. So it's probably important to point out that in order to have these skills when the shit hits the fan, it's important to practice when you're feeling good as well. 


Here's a ""testimonial"" of some sorts by McMan: 
http://www.mcmanweb.com/mindfulness1.html


I hope this can be of some help to you. Mood swings sucks and it's a tough life, but I hope that if you take up this practice that you can find some relief.



Disclaimer: I'm not officially diagnosed as bipolar. My father is bipolar though and I struggle with deep mood swings (being close to attempting suicide etc) and I'm going to see a psychiatrist later this month for a possible diagnosis for bipolar (I'm already seeing a psychologist and currently I'm weaning off setraline) and hopefully some medications that can help me.

1325233361.0,14,self.BipolarReddit,nw29d,A Happy Ending: What a Difference a Year Makes,15,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/nw29d/a_happy_ending_what_a_difference_a_year_makes/,"A little over a year ago (closer to mid-December, 2010), I attempted suicide by trying to overdose on as many pills as I had (which was a lot). 

It's the only thing I had courage to do. You see, I had recently failed out of college. After a long battle with my school and my illness, I finally failed and I couldn't live as a failure. It's a more common tale than I thought.  When I started at my University, I had no clue anything was wrong with me.  I was a creative bright kid and I thought the sky was the limit for me.  And, then, everything snowballed starting at the end of freshman year. 

It wasn't until my senior year of college (after a term-off from school) that I realized I had a mental illness (with the help of some professionals). but, everyone (including me) thought I had ADHD.  Another common story. It's often misdiagnosed. And, so, after one successful period, I thought I was cured.

The next term, I started to struggle again. I didn't understand why. My anxiety went up, I missed classes, and everything snowballed again. I was forced to go on medical leave for over a year in order to figure out my problems. 

Over that time, I figured out (on my own) that bipolar was my most-likely illness. And, I was right. I spent over 6 months working on my illness. I did in-hospital programs, worked tirelessly with my therapist and psychiatrist. I lose weight, got a summer job, and was going to start my last year and a half of school in the fall of 2010. Life was on the up.  At the time, I was taking trileptal.  It seemed to be doing the trick.

Of course, it didn't. All my classes started out fine. I attended all of them for the first couple of weeks. But, all of a sudden, similar signs started to show. I started to forget to take my medication, and here's what came next: Anxiety. Missed classes. Prolonged procrastination that ended up with me never doing major assignments.  I somehow scraped by in 3/4 classes...but, my academic probation forced me to have to get a C in all of my classes in order to stay at the University. 

Near the end of the term, I already knew I had failed one of my classes. And, I spent the next 2 weeks in the darkest place of my life. I would leave as if I was going to school, then, I would go park somewhere. And, just sit. I wouldn't know what to do or where to go. It was a nightmare. And, then, after much consideration, in the middle of a peaceful winter night, I placed all of my pills that I could find (again, A LOT) into a tupperware bowl, and started to swallow them, a couple at a time.

I started to feel really funny 1/4 of the way through, and I eventually took all of them (on an empty stomach). I thought that was it, and I thought it was an appropriate way to go. earlier that day, I wrote a bunch of cliched suicide notes on my computer. I didn't really know what to say in them, so, I wrote what I could. And, that was that.

In the following morning, I woke up to see that I vomited everything up. Orange powder was everywhere. I pulled out one of the blinds off of one of the windows in my room in an apparent struggle. 

I guess my body really tried to stay alive.

And, one year later, I fought back, after failing and being millimeters away from being kicked out of school (I received the letter and everything). And, guess what guys?

I graduated. After over 6 years of struggling, I graduated from a really great university and am on my way to start my independent life in the coming months. In fact, since January of 2011, I averaged a 3.8 GPA. It was an unbelievable fight, but, life is really different now. 

So, whenever you think you've reached your low, just know that the impossible is possible. You can do it. There is always a tomorrow, even when there isn't.  I'm living proof. 

But, don't be fooled, you can't do it on your own. You need a support system. You need proper help, and need a doctor who is willing to help you find the right medication. But, if that's not immediately possible, find support--whether it's in your community, in your family, or with your friends. That's why I succeeded. 

TL; DR  I attempted suicide a year ago because I failed out of school.  I fought to stay in school and graduated this past month. Anything is possible.

I've progressed a lot, I was obese and have slowly worked my way to being more fit, I got some meat on me but people sometimes don't believe that it is me that they are seeing, I've lost so much weight. 
I used to drink extreme amounts of alcohol to self medicate. Once I got help I stopped for a while, now it is just a tool for fun, I watch out not to drink too much when I do drink.
I've got a steady job, getting a raise soon, I was in a relationship that ended on good terms, have met women for some sexy time (almost impossible before, only in rare cases when I was in pure mania, not in a mixed state). I moved into a better place with better room mates in a great part of town, I'm meeting new exciting people very often.
But, I am not feeling much better. My social network has grown but I still feel lonely and alienated to pretty much everyone. This gets worse when I'm among people that are happy, and zombie jesus forbids, in love.
So now I am thinking, why the fuck am I taking these drugs? It has only made me a useful citizen and easier for people to talk to and live with.
I still get manic episodes, with very brief depressive episodes that follow. 
I think I might just as well quit the drugs and self destruct, its been years and as I stated, I've gotten my life into order but its all bullshit. The only thing that helped was that I was somewhat artistic, such with writing and poetry but the drugs killed that off.

I've met bipolar people that have quit drugs, due to them not believing that they are bipolar despite them displaying all the symptoms and they seemed messed up. But I want to know, are there any of you that have quit the drugs and gotten better and feel better afterwards? Or is it time to put a bullet through my brain and be done with it?

Still feel bad, want to quit the drugs.

In its own eddy boiling and o'erwrought,
A whirling gulf of phantasy and flame:
And thus, untaught in youth my heart to tame,
My springs of life were poisoned. 'Tis too late!
Yet am I changed; though still enough the same
In strength to bear what time cannot abate,
And feed on bitter fruits without accusing fate...

But soon he knew himself the most unfit
Of men to her with Man; with whom he held
Little in common; untaught to submit
His thoughts to others, though his soul was quelled,
In youth by his own thoughts; still uncompelled,
He would not yield dominion of his mind
To spirits against whom his own rebelled;
Proud though in desolation; which could find
A life within itself, to breathe without mankind.

My question for the group is who do you tell that you have bipolar and when?  Does your entire family know?  Friends?  Just close friends?  Anyone at work?  I don't think I want to broadcast to the world that I am bipolar but I do feel that the diagnosis helps explain my actions.

I was quickly put on antidepressants (prozac to start) and I proceeded to take them for about 4 years.  That's when the problems started...  

To begin, I was constantly battling with bizarre physical and sexual side effects.  Naturally, in response to these side effects, my shrink decided to play with my dosage and fool around with all sorts of meds.  By the time I turned 18, I had essentially run the gamut on SSRIs.  Wellbutrin made me anxious, prozac made me feel like a cow, zoloft made it so I couldn't take a piss, and each drug dulled my sexual arousal to nothing.  

Needless to say, when I went off to college (Big ups to my Badgers) I had gone through so many types of antidepressants that I decided it was time to quit.  I stopped altogether and I didn't look back.  Until...I fell into a severe spiral.  My grades dropped and I lost any and all ability to focus.  I lost many of my friends as I spiraled into my own world of suffering.  Sad as it sounds, that wasn't the worst of it.  Soon after my girl left me (I don't blame her, I was a wreck) and I was essentially by myself.  And I can't lie, I thought about ending it.  Alcohol became a great way to soothe the pain.  My drug use went up as well.

Despite all the pain, I graduated with a pretty descent GPA, could have done better, but given the circumstances I was pretty pleased.  Soon after I went to work.  

Flash forward three years and I found myself cycling through the same bouts of depression and mania.  Some months I was up, some months I was down.  I never felt settled and I never felt grounded.

This same type of cycling continued up until a few months ago.  I was fed up at this point and looking to make a change in my life.  I decide to see a highly recommended psychiatrist in my area.  I'm hesitant, but open to the idea of trying to better myself.  On a bit of a side note, my old shrink was a bust (he talked about weird sexual things - anyways, not important just thought I'd mention it).  Low and behold, this new guy is awesome.  We go over my family history (father is bipolar and so is my grandfather - go figure) and my reactions to previous SSRIs.  Within ten minutes he is convinced I'm bipolar.  He throws me on a mood stabilizer and now I'm feeling fine.

Anyways, I wanted to share this with everyone because I thought it might give some people hope.  Don't trust what every psych says, some turn out to be dead wrong.  How my first psych missed my father and grandfather's diagnoses as indicators of my condition, I'll never understand.  So, forgive the length, I think this was a pretty cathartic experience for me.  Thanks to everyone and I hope everyone feels better soon!

I have never considered myself to be bipolar. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety a couple of years ago, but none of the meds I was prescribed ever helped. I eventually got frustrated and gave up.

I'm a rapid cycler and I've been all over the place lately.

This morning I was already feeling very down, that can't-get-out-of-bed depression, and then a coworker got under my skin and I sank even lower.  Often when this kind of thing happens I am tempted to just tell everyone what's going on, but I know that it's a very bad idea.  I'm not really close enough with any of them to even confide privately in just one person.

What happened this morning has been happening a lot lately, and I feel like it's affecting the level of authority I have.

I guess I'm not great at hiding it and then I have to deal with the added stress of coworkers asking me ""are you okay?"" or treating me with kid gloves because I seem over-sensitive.  I feel like everyone's wondering what the fuck my problem is all the time.

So?  How do you all manage this sort of thing?  I'm curious to hear, and I could also use some advice.

Thank you!,13,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1infl5/my_incarcerated_bipolar_son_wants_me_to_share/,"A Few Manic Thoughts from Inside

Day to day I swim through a pool of idiots. I struggle not to drown in all of the stupidity. This pool is state prison. I miss having conversations that aren't about ""fu**ing the police"" or ""true gangstas"" or ""robbin erribody"". I was raised by two smart, competent parents, both teachers, and now I've been thrown into a population of people who think ""education is for fags"". In here I feel smart which I think is sort of funny. In school I struggled with math, but here I'm considered a human calculator. 

I should have joined the military like my family wanted me to do. I was so close to joining the marine corps...but like an idiot I chose to stay home for a girl, a girl I'm no longer even with.  But there was another reason I didn't want to join. I didn't think I was mentally capable of handling basic training. I am bipolar.

I haven't slept in three days. I've been exercising constantly and chugging coffee like I'm dying of thirst. Sometime soon I'm going to pass the f**k out. I wouldn't want someone so unstable to be handling an automatic weapon, would you? It's all irrelevant now since people with felonies can't join the military. So here I am.

I'm sure the thought of ""where did I go wrong"" has crossed my parents' minds. That leaves me feeling like a complete waste of skin. My parents didn't go wrong. I was destined to do something extreme and impulsive. I've always done things literally the hardest way possible. I was just a raging storm of bipolar and always have been. When my brother and I were younger, my parents thought my younger brother was dull. No. He's normal. I'm just incredibly bipolar.

I'm as bipolar as the sun is hot. My hand is literally shaking like I have a tremor. Sometimes I scare myself. I can't slow down at all. The world seems to be moving so slowly compared to me. I feel like a car speeding on empty. I'm so tired but there's no way I can sleep. This is disabling. I cannot function like there isn't anything wrong with me. I can't operate within the normal emotional and physical spectrum. I exceed the norm. I feel like shit. But at the same time I have a mixture of a live wire and rocket fuel propelling itself through my veins. I'm struggling right now. Thoughts flood my head. Thoughts that are totally irrelevant and random. They make no sense and I can't stop thinking. I'm sick of them harassing me. I need to be medicated properly. And I need sleep. I'm fighting a nuclear war in my head and I'm losing.

My advice to you is this: if you have something you are in denial about, or you aren't dealing with, face it head on and never take a single moment for granted.  You never know how good you've got it until it's gone. I didn't handle my bipolar on the outside and now I can't get help on the inside. I'm surrounded by incompetent neanderthals.

I'd say I'm going to sleep now, but actually I'm just going to lie down and think more random thoughts until morning. Good night.

My medication seems to have fallen out from underneath me in the last month and I feel upside down. Sideways. Out of my mind. I'm at the peak of a cyclothymic episode and this has been going on for about the same time my medication started becoming less effective, approximately 5 weeks ago. And this episode, caused by defective meds, is the reason I don't have the coping skills to deal with the medication problem. I feel crazy. Can you tell by my stunted talking right now? I feel like I'm losing my mind.

I am **SO HAPPY** and **SO SAD** every fucking day.

I'm fighting. With everyone. Coworkers, friends, family, even my boyfriend. Who is/has put up with way more crap than anyone should or have to. I had a meltdown last night because he made a remark about the laundry. Yelled at him to leave the apartment because I wanted to be nowhere near him and I wasn't capable of leaving. Then, 20 minutes later, I came crawling back apologizing and sobbing and nose running and shaking and I could feel my brain throbbing and unloaded all my stress.

My work has been so slow the last month that even though I am a full time employee, I only worked two total weeks in the last month and I won't have the funds to make it through the next month. And because things have been so slow at work, I am finding out today if I am indeed being laid off. Which I'm hoping for, because that way I can get unemployment and use what little of a paycheck I'm getting to carry me until I find a new job.

But the boyfriend's birthday is in two weeks and I won't be able to afford a gift or even a drink at the bar for him. And he spoiled me on my birthday. Made me feel like a princess and got me all this awesome stuff and I know it shouldn't be about stuff or money, but I like doing nice things for him because he really truly loves me and puts up with so much of my shit, he deserves a nice day for just him.

I can't take this anymore. I am having suicidal thoughts despite having the emotional maturity to not carry through on anything because no matter how I feel right now, I have a lot to live for and look forward to in my life. I'm young, I'm 24, I have so much left to accomplish and do and see and experience in my life. But I feel like a teenager with all these intrusive thoughts. I think about what went wrong when I attempted suicide in high school, though I did barely make it out.

I want to be in the hospital again, in the psych ward. But I know that isn't the solution. I want to stop crying every day. I want the strength to get out of bed in the morning, and the power to go to bed because I need sleep to stay sane. I don't want to have five anxiety attacks a day.

I just want to be better. I just want to be normal. I want the feeling of both feet on solid ground. I want my brain and my heart to agree for once. I didn't ask for this and I don't deserve this. This isn't fair. To me, to you, to anyone struggling with a mental illness.

That would be ideal.

I finally, somehow, managed to graduate college.  It was an extremely stressful procedure (really hard engineering program), and I always thought, if only I wasn't dealing with all of this, I'd have time to be a happy and healthy person.  So suddenly I have a break with no responsibilities or concerns, and I'm very quickly approaching my ideal state of health.

This is wonderful, and I've been very excited about it, but the sudden switch is making me a bit concerned.  I'm exercising everyday, after not doing more than walking for months.  I've rediscovered my spirituality, after four years of doubt.  I'm cooking, I'm playing music, I am thrilled to be with friends and family, I'm able to look at a sunset and feel genuine awe at its beauty, and I'm finally happy.  It's great, but it sounds a bit like hypomania to me.

I get hypomanic almost every spring to early summer.  This year I went through a prolonged depression instead, and I hoped I could just eventually return to normal.  Maybe this is normal, just who I am when not oppressed by school.  Or should I be concerned?  Should I enjoy it while it lasts?  Do I need to rein it in?  I'm so confused.  Help?

**Edit:** For the record, I'm on 400mg Lamictal and 100mg Wellbutrin.  I have a very good psychiatrist, although I did completely forget about my last appointment, mainly because I've been feeling so good that I'm not feeling the urgent need to talk to someone about my issues.

I finally had money, I'd just bought him a new collar he never wore, new toys he never played with, I was saving for the pet deposit at my next place.

Hi there again, guys. As some of you may remember from my last post I started sliding into depression about 2 months ago. It was starting to impair my ability to do, well, anything, and I broke up with my boyfriend and moved back in with my mom because of it. A couple nights after that I was thinking way too much and managed to get myself 20 minutes of sleep before I had to go to work. I woke up feeling fucking fantastic. Like I could take on the world, ya know? 


Well, working in a kitchen there's a lot of alarms and buzzers going off as we prepare for the day, and it only took one buzzer to have the overwhelming urge to scream at it and start throwing things. Instead I took a deep breath, said that I'd be back in 5, bit my tongue, and walked outside to my car. As soon as I got there I started crying and hyperventilating. I've only felt like that a few in my life, and it was *terrifying*. I managed to gain my composure back within a few minutes (thankfully, my panic attacks get out of hand real fast) and used one of my good old trusty coping mechanisms to somewhat detach myself from my thoughts and autopilot my way through the morning. Sure, the alarms still made me want to start punching people, and any time someone would talk to me I'd consider drop kicking them in the face, but it was so surreal that I didn't act on any of my impulses.


Now, I have a history of lack of sleep inducing mania/hypomania, but I've never gone straight from depression to mania. I'm getting none to 4 hours of sleep a night, and any night that I do get 6+ hours of sleep I can barely drag my ass out of bed. I'm still depressed when I don't sleep, but I'm every other kind of feels on top of it, too. The suicidal ideation is so intense. So vivid. Yet I've resisted all the urges to self-harm. I have Klonopin for sleep and I've even only taking the recommended dose for that. Without it I probably wouldn't be getting more than an hour of sleep. There's also the racing thoughts and fantastic ideas, but I have no willpower to start planning past ""Best idea ever!"". Ugh. Visual/Auditory hallucinations that I just don't give a shit about, too. I feel like a blender.


I've been like this for about 2.5 weeks now, every day has been all kinds of horrible. I don't see my psychiatrist until the 20th, and I'm too anxious to call. There's a long confusing story as to why I'm not going to therapy regularly, and an even more confusing story as to how I managed to get a therapy session for tomorrow. Maybe she'll at least be able to talk to my psychiatrist for me. Only 100mg of Lamictal isn't doing shit for me.


I just want to curl up and pretend to not exist until this episode ends, but I'm paying for all my treatment and if I lost my job I'd lose my insurance and I'm pretty sure I'd hate myself even more if that happened.

&gt;ICCD Clubhouses are founded on the realization that recovery from serious mental illness must involve the whole person in a vital and culturally sensitive community. A Clubhouse community offers respect, hope, mutuality and unlimited opportunity to access the same worlds of friendship, housing, education and employment as the rest of society.

So basically they're community-run spaces that offer support and resources to people with mental illnesses.

They explicitly do not offer medical services or therapy, from my understanding. It seems really cool! If I wasn't applying for a job there, I might just go there to hang out.

As a quick summary, my wife has been diagnosed with bipolar w/ psychotic tendencies. She spent six weeks in the hospital suffering from a delusion that a former coworker had been masterminding her life for the past twenty years, that she was a princess, and that he was coming to take her away.

------

And now on with our continuing saga....


I think that the final delusion may be starting to crumble.

The other day we were talking about everything, and she piped up 'He had to have been there, right?  It wouldn't make sense if he wasn't'.

She was talking about what I believe was her initial delusion - 'the guy' was at a hospital where we were visiting a friend of hers, and he had said something to the effect of 'Ahh, there she is' and started to approach her.

My answer was that it didn't matter if he was there or not (she knows I don't think he was there, we've talked about it before) because either way it brought up issues in our relationship we need to work through.

But, I'm taking hope in that if she is starting to doubt whether or not she saw him, that maybe she is going to start to want to stay in the relationship.  AND, after that, she's been starting to say that she is feeling sad that she isn't feeling a connection between us.  

Again, it seems like a small thing, but its a feeling.  Any feeling.  A week ago, she was telling me she had not emotions about us, and that she felt emotionally numb.  The fact that she is feeling sad is an improvement!  And I've seen her smiling and lauging at the girls, so I know she is also feeling some happiness.  

Yesterday, after we put up our Christmas tree, she told me she had almost started crying because she realized it might be out last Christmas together as a family.  Again, feeling emotion is a *good* thing! Frankly I would prefer her being mad / pissed off at me than feeling 'nothing'.  And yes, I know that my feelings there are normal.  *grin*

There have been a few more baby steps in the past couple of days.

1) When we're watching a show on TV, she will occasionally grab my hand to hold it;

2) She pulled me close to cuddle in bed.  Not asking, or me taking action, but grabbing my arm and pulling me in.

3) Last night she was looking over old photos of us (YAY!) and when I got home later in the evening, she told me that she saw that we DID have a connection when we were in Paris (about 4 years ago, while she was pregnant with our youngest), and wondered what happened to us.  The great news for me with this one is that now she is acknowledging that we DID have something.  Prior to this, she wasn't sure if we ever did or not! 


Now that the final delusion is falling, and she is beginning to admit we used to have a relationship, I'm hoping that she will soon actually WANT to save it!

I think the odds of short term success for our marriage may have just nudged above 50%.

At some point I want to have a talk with her that she's not going to like....  She's said a few times that she wishes she knew whether 'the guy' was married or gay because it would make her decision easier.  I'm going to talk to her about how if she wants to stay, it has to be because she wants to be with me, not because her boy-toy is unavailable.  I need to know that if his relationship falls apart she's not going to go all through this again.  Or that the next time she meets someone who she is attracted to she's not going to want to leave.

I'm trying to figure out the best time to talk to her about this is.   She seems to be starting to emotionally recover now, and I think it would probably be better to wait until she is a bit more stable emotionally before doing it.  Thoughts?  Obviously it has to be done at some point.

We are also seeing a therapist together for our marriage.  This person is trying to use Emotional Focused Therapy (http://www.amazon.ca/Hold-Me-Tight-Conversations-Lifetime/dp/031611300X) to try to rebuild the emotional attachments between us.  I know its helping me realize how I've contributed towards her feelings about the the relationship.  Even if my wife isn't in a state yet for it to help, hopefully it will give us tools to work on the relationship when she is ready.

I hope you all have a great Christmas season!  As a side note, I've had a few PMs telling me that I should cut bait and run while I can.  To me that is not an option at this point.  

I know that its going to be tough remaining in this relationship, and that at this point I have no idea how bad things may get.  But so far its manageable (barely...)  and she is willing to keep on her medication, and things are slowly getting better.

If I see something that I really like, I end up wanting it *now*, regardless of whether or not I actually *need* the actual product in the long run. For example, I dropped $150 on the collector's edition of Guild Wars 2, only to end up quitting it weeks later. The other night, I was craving a burger at 9PM, so I ended up driving 30 minutes to the nearest Five Guys, just for a burger. (Arguably, the burger was totally worth it though.) I have a perfectly working smartphone right now (Samsung Galaxy Nexus), and I want the successor (LG Nexus 4), just because it's new and shiny, even though it's only a small upgrade in terms of specifications.

Having access to a lot of money only makes trying to control impulsive behavior that much worse (yeah, yeah, I know, #firstworldproblem).

Right now, I'm trying my best to resist throwing away $25k (+trade in) on a brand new [Nissan 370Z](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/2009_Nissan_Z34_Fairlady_Z_02.JPG) with all the bells and whistles.

I guess I should mention that I'm already heavily medicated, not that it does anything to help this go away. My therapist actually seems to *encourage* these impulsive buying sprees/retail therapy (like buying a motorcycle) because ""it's something new and exciting, so that'd help your depression,"" so that doesn't really help.

Also, I have this ridiculous urge to pull a Charlie Sheen and hire an escort and do some coke, you know, *just once*.

Last year was the best year of my life depression-wise, so I asked my doc if I could start lowering my meds. We started with my anti-depressent (I am on cymbalta, lamictal and seroquel) so i tapered from 60mg to 30 mg. I had always thought that maybe I didn't really have depression and/or bipolar and was just weak or something. But everything has been terrible lately. 
At first I just thought it was the cymbalta withdrawal (I tapered very slowly, about 5 mg a week, but the cymbalta withdrawals are the worst I hear). But my suicidal thoughts have been coming back (not straight up suicidal again, just the thoughts), racing thoughts are back, trouble sleeping is back, overall depression is back. 
It really sucks and the worst part is I actually thought I was better or didn't really have a problem, and lowering my meds made me realize I do, and will probably have it my whole life. 
I really, really don't want to go back up to 60mg of cymbalta, because I feel like it is taking a step back, and I (unrealistically, I realize) wanted to be off all my meds by the time I graduate and start real life (in May). 
Basically just needed to share my feelings, maybe get some similar stories. 

tl;dr: has anyone else ever felt they may not actually have bipolar or depression and were mis/overdiagnosed? has anyone gone through a really good period and tried lowering meds just to realize it got worse?

EDIT: thanks for all the replies, making me feel much better and helping me accept certain realities. Will probably decide to go back up to 60mgs.

I dropped out of University over a year ago and haven't been able to work since because of crippling depression. I've somehow managed to survive this long with some money saved up in my placement year and a small amount of inheritance. The only benefits that I seem to be eligable for only covers 2/3 of my rent a month, and my council tax.

Apparently I can't get disability or employment support allowance, even with letters from 3 seperate doctors informing them of my illness. This even includes the mental health lead in my local county, who you'd think they'd listen to. After arguing with them for 4-5 months, I gave up, considering they're either unable to or unwilling to actually tell you why your application fails.

So that means I'm currently -£1922.13 out of a 2k overdraft. Luckily my phone-bill comes out at the start of the month, so at least I'll have a phone for this month.

But I don't see where I'm going to get the rest of my rent before the 12th Oct 2012. Even if I was able to get signed up to a government program today, they all pay in arrears which mean I won't get any help for weeks.

So, thank you to those who contribute.

I was diagnosed bipolar a few years ago and have had my fair share of mood swings. We all know the drill. It's not pretty. I've been depressed for a long time. I recently decided that I need to find my happy, which I guess is my own way of saying that I'm trying to be more positive and redefine my story. What would it mean if I didn't see x incident the way I've always seen it, and so on and so forth. Actively trying to change my perspective has been difficult, but beneficial.

Today, though, the positive aspects of my life were very hard to ignore, and I found myself thankful for a lot of things, not the least of which was the subtle reminder that no matter how shitty I feel there's a world of good, positive, things that I'm lucky to have and I'm simply not paying attention to: I slept in my contacts two nights ago and tried to take them out in yesterday morning. I scratched my eyeball doing this and spent the day in an immense amount of pain - my eye was hurting, it was sensitive to light, and it was weeping. This morning I woke up and it was no better. I was worried I'd done serious damage to it. I called a doctor's office and they gave me a same day appointment. It's easy to take something like this for granted, but the truth is that I have access to doctors, doctors that are willing to see me even though they probably want to get home to their families. I have health insurance, and the money to pay for the visit. I have a car to get there. I live in a place with the infrastructure to make all of this possible. I have my health, and thankfully I didn't do any permanent damage to my eye.

This may seem a little bit cheesy, and maybe I sound spoiled. I like to think that I appreciate my life and spend time thinking about those things that I am thankful for on a daily basis, but the truth is that it's easy to forget about the stuff that's right that you're not paying attention to. Even if I didn't have health insurance, and couldn't really afford to see a doctor, the fact that I live in a place where there ARE doctors is amazing. I spent two years living in East Africa, and it's easy to forget how much better off I am than most people on this planet.

[x-post from /r/bipolar],15,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/vi4ke/so_i_just_came_back_from_my_weekly_therapy/,"It was awful. I've been having issues with my pdoc for the past few months because of various things. Here's a list to make things easier for reading purposes:

* 1 - Does not respond to my concerns. This can be my heat tolerance issue with my current dose of Seroquel (50mg), weight gain from said Seroquel, questions about other medications reacting with Seroquel. 
* 2 - Tells me that she does not have the time to compose a letter for a university I will be attending in the fall. I am trying to receive some accommodations at my future university, in case of an event where something happens. This was strongly encouraged through my academic adviser at community college. 
* 3 - Does not explain to me what certain terms mean. According to my intake notes I am now Mood Disorder N.O.S., instead of my previous diagnosis with my older doctor- Which was Bipolar Type II with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. At the time my pdoc assured me that she  wrote that I was previously diagnosed with said BP2. This doesn't bother as much for me, though in my notes it says that I was ""self-described."" 

After talking to my therapist for a few weeks to a month, she brought in the supervisor at my clinic so I can voice my concerns. I thought that it was a good opportunity for me to do so. My therapist encouraged me to be honest, and don't hide anything. The response from the supervisor however made me feel that I should have kept my mouth closed. 

Some things that the supervisor said:

* 1 - Regarding my questions about certain medications interacting with my psyche medications, my pdoc does not have time to answer my questions.
* 2 - I should not ask questions because my appointments with my pdoc are for maintenance purposes, only.
* 3 - It is assumed that ""self-described"" means that I was previously diagnosed. I was not told this previously from my pdoc. I responded that an explanation from the pdoc would have been sufficient for me to understand this term. Which leads to...
* 4 - Supervisor telling me that the clinic does not have time to explain things to me.
* 5 - Doctor's don't answer questions about the medication, or concerns.
* 6 - That I should be thankful for my pdoc to sign a form required for me to receive benefits (which I am, but also it's just signing a piece a paper in the long run) This is when the supervisor raised her voice and yelled at me, probably from frustration.
* 7 - Why did I leave my previous doctor if I say that my previous doctor was very informational when it comes to my concerns. (I replied with, because I have moved.)
* 8 - And finally, if I have been taking my medication regularly. (I have been, never missed an appointment.)


I'm not quite sure how I should feel about this situation. I do feel that I don't want to go back there anymore. Was I overreacting? Is it wrong for me to be concerned about my own health? I don't try to bombard my pdoc with questions that are pointless. I write them down ahead of time. Many of the concerns I have had been going on for more than a month. 

I was given an option of changing my pdoc, but I won't be able to see him till after the 11th of July. I am also moving to another State in August. I have enough Seroquel till October or so. 

It may be my craziness, but I also felt like I was not being heard a lot of the times. Common complaint, but it sure felt like it. Should I leave this clinic because I have enough medication? Should I keep seeing the same pdoc? Should I write a complaint? I'm not sure what I should do, and I feel like making a hasty decision without some input from others can be disastrous.

I felt like this for years, I started young and it's only gotten worse. I'm taking lithium and it has eliminated my manic phases but I still find my mood fluctuating significantly. I feel like I've traded away one of the only things that ever brought me any joy in life for a little stability, and even then not much. The dose I'm at is pretty low, but any higher and the side effects become as bad as the symptoms. Some days are fine, in the sense that on the outside I look, sound, and function like the person everyone thinks I am, but on the inside nothing is ever alright. I feel completely alone in the world, I have plenty of friends for the time being and am well liked but there is always a distance that never seems to be bridged. Nobody understands this. My closest friends all know about my diagnosis, but always seem confused whenever I become more depressed than usual. My doctors all obsess about my suicidal thoughts but the only help I'm ever offered is a referral to a new doctor or a new drug, which isn't really a choice at all and neither of which ever seem to get anywhere beyond those two steps. I can't really talk about this with my doctors, and I can't and won't talk about it with my friends because they don't understand anyhow and it just spreads my suffering a little thinner.

I'm bipolar II with ADD, PMDD, some BPD/histrionic tendencies, and substance-abuse issues. 

I've been hospitalized more than 10 times for depression, self-destructive behaviour, cocaine-induced psychosis, etc. 

Regardless, I'm self-sufficient, I have my own home-based business and I'm in graduate school. 

I do that with the help of Wellbutrin XL, Concerta, Adderall, Vyvanse and YAZ. (I take Concerta daily; I switch every few days between Adderall and Vyvanse are because they're relatively new to my regime, and I'm uncertain if I like them. Adderall flattens me out a bit but Vyvanse makes me anxious.)

I'm aware I probably won't have children; I've been pregnant before and chose to terminate it. I suffered extreme postpartum depression, attempted suicide, ended up in the hospital, and put my then-husband through hell. (Postpartum depression can happen even if you choose to terminate the pregnancy.)

I'm wary about being in a committed relationship again. Relationships make me anxious; they usually trigger major depressive episodes. I've had serious suicide attempts in most of my major relationships. The pain these events cause my loved ones is too much to bear. 
 
I rarely disclose my mental illness to people I work with or to my university. I disclose my illness to friends, and I disclose my ADD to a few of my professors if managing my symptoms becomes difficult due to deadline pressures, course-work loads, and the like. It's rare for me, though, to request accommodations such as deadline extensions. 

I'm annoyed when I hear people use mental illness as a reason for why they cannot manage their lives or why they treat loved ones badly. I've treated loved ones badly as a result of my illness, yes, and I bore the consequences personally. But it was me--mentally ill me, yes--who caused harm and hurt.

I'm not down on people who are severely disabled by their mental illness but nobody IS their mental illness. My illness is manageable most of the time. I understand medication and lifestyle changes are only stop-gap measures for some people. I've so much more compassion and empathy, though, when I see people who are mentally ill remain themselves and not their illness even if their illness makes them difficult or ""unattractive"" to others who may have a limited understanding of mental illness.

I couldn't imagine life without her. I didn't think I was strong enough to make it on my own but recently some shit hit the fan and I haven't been able to talk to her for a month and a half. 

I am amazed that I have survived without her and as each day passes I wonder why I felt like I needed her as much as I did. She made me feel like a doormat but I would never leave. 

The pain of ending a relationship to me is like getting a fish hook stuck in your cheek. As long as you leave it in, pushing and pulling it, the wound never heals. However if you push it all the way through, sure it hurts a lot for a short time but then it starts to heal. 

I have a bad habit of picking scabs, emotional wounds, that I just won't let heal. For some reason I seem to like to keep the pain fresh but it hinders me greatly, never letting me move on. 

I had been on and off again with this person for 8 years now and while I am not happy that she found someone new before our relationship ever ended I do find myself looking forward to new relationships. Hopefully with someone who likes me for me: kooky and bi-polar.

Also when I was much younger I found it much easier to cope with physical pain as opposed to emotional pain. It was almost like I felt TOO MUCH, all my emotions were too strong, amplified if you will.

Also during manic phases I have thought I was incredibly attracted to people but then they do ONE THING that I don't agree with and I flip like a light switch. Now that I'm medicated I am finding myself getting enamored with females less and less.

She also said it might be her mood.  I know with work and family, the relationship and seeing each other a lot might be adding to her stress.  I want to tell her when I see her next that, again, it's okay to take her space.  That occasional distance and taking time to herself won't change me being there and that it'll just make the time we do get together more special.  I also don't want her to think I'm running, I'm not I'm just wanting to be respectful of what she needs and still keep her in my life.

After reading another posters story and seeing the advice he got, I decided I would post here seeking similar.

I started a relationship with a wonderful girl two months ago.  At first I was confused by her changes in mood from wanting to be around me, to wanting space.  I just discovered that she has bipolar disorder tonight.

I've been spending my time researching the disease and how I can be there for her, because I want nothing more than to make this relationship last.  We are pretty amazing together and she makes me feel like no one else has.

That all said, I guess I'm wondering what sort of things I should avoid or do in order to be prepared to be there for her.  I've read that busy schedules and things like that negatively effect, but at this point in our relationship I can't very well ask her to reduce her work.  She is a fiercely independent person and that's something I admire about her.

She just started one of her cycles, where she doesn't want me around.  She said that being around me too much is the quickest way to anger and bore her.  I understand, so I try to just send a text or two during this time to remind her I'm there but not be forceful.  Any other advice would be wonderful.

I'm also afraid my anxiety may have hurt things.  Maybe saying something or doing something that doesn't show her I'm strong enough to be there, cause I am also trying to emotionally open up to her.  Is this an issue?

At the time I was diagnosed depressed and on anti-depressants; this would later change after hypo-manic tendencies and responding very well to Bipolar meds. Like any abusive relationship, he started out normal. Towards the end, he was locking me in his car and driving around (rendering me unable to leave) while verbally (and occasionally physically) attacking me with derisive comments as to my personality and life. His ""theory"" was that if he could break me down to my most vulnerable, he could rebuild me as a mentally stable person. He also believed that to take medication was weak. I managed to escape the relationship and have mostly recovered from the incident (for a while I was unable to ride in cars alone with a man). I have obviously realized since that he was also severely emotionally disturbed. However, the insecurity in relation to taking medication has taken longer to diminish.

Today, I am medicated and doing very well (although I try not to let people know as often anymore, hah). I've tried to go the non-med route a couple of times, but it never worked. Over the years I have still been surprised to see many people expressing that medication is weak, wrong, or over-prescribed. I tend to be most sympathetic with the last point, but it's really not for that person to judge others' emotions. Occasionally I'll even get the ""but you seem so stable/happy, you don't need to be on meds!"" ridiculousness.

Anyways, today I encountered someone saying that ""Caffeine, alcohol, and anti-depressants are all morally and ethically unsound to consume."" Luckily, the writer was expressing that even though she believed the substances were wrong, she also believed that it was a person's choice to make and not the government's. At this point I am not even affected into thinking she's right, but did feel very upset over it. I posted a counter argument, and I guess we'll see how that goes.

Now, I know I should not be so influenced by what other people think of me - I'm working on it! So I'm just curious as to how you guys react. How did you get over your personal hesitations when it comes to meds? Do you ever let someone know about your disorder/medication (I tend to be overly open, been cutting it down to just *very* close friends)? If your friend expresses an opinion - whether they know about you or not - do you attempt to sway them or just stand silent? What are your arguments?

All of a sudden years of behaviour makes sense, and finally in the last month I've started getting better at realising whether I am depressed or hypomanic while in the mood, which is helping me adjust my expectations accordingly.

However, I've been having a lot of identity issues, particularly associated with the hypomania. 

I now know that all the times when I feel the best, the most outgoing, the smartest, the happiest, the most productive- are officially a symptom. I always accepted that me being depressed was 'illness,' (I was diagnosed with depression for 7 years) and my normal was 'a bit down', because I've always waited and counted on the week when I feel the most ME. I feel the most ME when I am hypomanic. And this feeling will often be directly linked with a downswing. Is that me too?

Just wanted to know if anyone else has had similar thoughts, or problems? Everyone keeps telling me - just take the good parts, and ride out the bad, and I see the wisdom of that thinking- but I have no one to talk to who actually knows how this feels.

UPDATE: I am flat out and can't reply to everyone right now, but seeing message after message of people who have felt the same was is so heartening. I feel a lot less alone.

That's what we hope people with mental illnesses do. We want them to feel free to acknowledge their condition and seek treatment. Talk to a therapist. Try medication. Follow a doctor's plan to treat your illness. ""You can feel better if you seek treatment."" Isn't that what we say?

Well, that's what my 21 year old son has done. Finally. After over two years of ignoring his diagnosis, he's finally acknowledged it and sought treatment. In prison.

See where it's gotten him.

He is currently incarcerated in our state prison. Inside, he has had to convince the DOC psychiatrists that his Bipolar Disorder is real. The psychiatrists on the payroll who are expected to treat inmates for mental illnesses have been less than helpful.

All this time, while my son has been in prison, he's been trying to tell them he's ""Bipolar"". At first, they believed him and gave him a generic anti-depressant and a low dose of a mood stabilizer. Not the meds he'd been on in the past, but at least they were something. Then he was experiencing bad side effects so he reported them to the psychiatrist making her rounds on his tier that day. This was her response:

""So maybe you're not Bipolar!""

You can imagine my shock when my son told me a medical professional said this to him. Isn't it her job to diagnose and treat mental illnesses? Yet she can speak to a patient like this?

But the worst part was what she did next.

She took him off the anti-depressant completely. She told him that in order to receive any more treatment, his doctor needed to contact her and inform her of his Bipolar diagnosis. She left him on the low dose of mood stabilizer which he said did ""nothing"". Subsequent visits from her and other psychiatrists doing their rounds on his tier did nothing to improve the limbo in which he'd been damned.

So for the last several months I've been trying to acquire all of his records to prove that he IS, in fact, Bipolar. First, I called his regular doctor who was unable to call the doctor at the prison- this is because the diagnosis did not come from his regular doctor, it came from a psychiatric hospital. Makes sense.

So then I went the route of requesting his medical records. Sounds easy enough. But consider the fact that he's 21 years old. This means every single medical professional he saw in his lifetime required a separate release form signed by my son. So, through snail mail, I began my quest of accessing the forms, sending them to him to be signed, having him send them back to me, and then sending them to the correct establishments in hopes of receiving the records. This was a nightmare. Thankfully, the nurse at his regular doctor's office helped me with this and eased the stress considerably.

We were almost home free when we realized that the release forms we'd been using were not accepted at certain mental health facilities. 

Back to the drawing board.

Thankfully, at this point our attorney stepped in and worked his magic to acquire the records more quickly. It's amazing what attorneys can accomplish. What took us months took him less than a week. So now, we may have finally struck gold. The last of the records have been acquired and presented to the prison mental health ward director along with a personal note from our attorney.

After FIVE MONTHS, my inmate son may finally be given the proper medication for his Bipolar Disorder.

So Maybe he IS Bipolar like he's been saying all along.

I try to make it go away with food, I splurge, or masturbation, which I usually abstain from. (nofapper) Or sweets like a donut. 

It's the sensation of being unjustly locked in prison for a crime you didn't commit. Then you're alone in your cell and there's no point in screaming because no one will hear it, so all the disarray and static in your head make you tremor with hate.

Then, eventually, tranquility. The agitation passes and you forget it ever happened.

I am afraid to even to try to find a door, to enter the room, to endure the pointed glances, the turned backs, the dropped hints that I am doing wrong, that I should have the common sense to behave the right way.

Wondering how their teeth are so white, pressing my lips down over yellowed teeth, wondering what else looks wrong to them, at the same time hating the superficiality of it all, hating mirrors, hating reflections.

Hating my face as it reflects back in the mirror, always unreal and ugly and not mine. Why did they think I was beautiful? They don't say that now, but they used to. I wasn't an individual but an object to please them. To be what they wanted me to reflect and angry when I didn't. Seeing myself reflected as something always less, falling short, yet pressed to do more. I deformed my body with food and hid in sleep and dreams of a better place and caring people, as the years clicked by, and woke up realizing I had missed all the places I should have visited along the way. The sharing points of life. The parties of youth, first loves, adventure, exploration, concerts, marriage, family, children, all things that lend a common nostalgia that I can't even share.

I spend so much time reading about everyone here, people with some symptoms that I don't have or maybe to a severity that I don't have, that I end up constantly questioning my diagnosis and being stuck in a state of denial.

I need to remember that I am different than every other person here. Bipolar affects me differently than Joe Shmoe, though we may share some same symptoms and be able to relate to each other we will both struggle differently and to greater extents.

I need to remember that I am diagnosed bipolar, that I am on medicine that seems to be somewhat working, that not ""feeling bipolar"" is a sign that my treatment is working properly and my moods are evening out.

The truth is that when I was diagnosed I found this subreddit, and finally was able to relate and get some answers as to why I am the way I am and why I have had the experiences I have. For the first time in years I had some sense in the fogginess of undiagnosed, rapid-cycling bipolar.

But I think its time to step back. It's only been a few months since I was diagnosed and I need to take some time and find myself, to accept my diagnosis.

I struggled to walk because I would stumble to one direction and then to another direction. My legs weren't moving properly either like my foot would go sideways when walking and one leg would overlap with the other leg so I would trip on myself . Finally got to the kitchen and I got a box of assorted nuts. Walking up stairs was hell. Finally got upstairs into my room, drank water and trying hard to eat the nuts. Got more disoriented and I got so dizzy that putting my head up was so blurry. I couldn't see right so I had to stop txting. 5 minutes later I was a vomiting machine . I threw up 12 times in 30 minutes. It was red. Maybe I was throwing up a little blood. Don't really know. My mouth got really numb, had no saliva, lips got numb and inflated. By then I begged my parents to take me to me to the ER. I started to have a really hard time talking. It took a minute to get a sentence or two out. Mucus was running from my mouth like niagra falls. When my parents gave me my shoes I was really afraid I was gonna throw up on them. I really like my shoes. So I was put in the car. In the car I threw up 6 times, started to have double vision, and it got really hard to breathe. I was breathing hard and fast through my mouth. Got to the er and everything got worse. I threw up on the ground and all the symptoms I had got worse I stumbled through the halls while the doctors were holding me side by side . Got to the bed . Respiration got fast, heart a pulse strikes, and blood pressure got low. They fixed the pulse and heart. But my respiration and blood pressure was a problem. I got blood tests, my double vision was terrible. My legs, feet, and arms got numb and couldn't move. I ended up throwing up 13+ an hour, which was good. I had mucus coming out still. I couldn't answer the questions like "" where are you? What's your name?"" I had to get tubes in my nose and mouth to get me breathe right and help stop the too much vomiting. Later they gave me a juice that would help with dehydration and vomiting . But it tasted so bad and my stomach was too upset so I ended up throwing up 18 times in 30-40 minutes. So they had to give me an IV for the dehydration and vomiting. It helped. So then I fell asleep after 3 hours of this. Woke up at 7. Still had a hard time breathing an bad neasua and bad respiration and double sight . I only threw up 13 times today because I have an oxygen an neasua tube and I went without it for 20 minutes. The tube is saving me from a world of vomit, I love the tube. I got an iv for dehydration and vomiting still. The good part of this is that I got to have a therapy dog. His name is Parker and was a black lab. I've been peeing a lot too. 6 times today and it was 700-800 miligrAms of it everytime I went to pee. I took a nap too. Every 2 hours I get my vitals checked. I fell asleep at 11 pm and I woke up at 3 am. It's 6 am right now. I just got an EKG test 15 minutes ago and my blood drawn 20 minutes ago. Everyone is so nice. I got my own plushie too. Ill be staying all this day and maybe Friday too. It takes 24 + hours to get to half-life.

I have no idea what happened. I was doing so well! But first I had a few days of anxiety, then a few days of horrible depression (really, it was all I could do to get through it alive), and now... this. Slowly, climbing, ever higher. 

I don't usually drink. I had friends over for drinks two days ago, went out drinking last night, and had plans to go wine tasting tonight. My psychologist was like... ""yeah, no."" I'm glad that my boyfriend and the friend we were going to go out with tonight are happy to stay in and do something else, but I'm still bummed out. I *want* to go drink. I want to party it up and feel amazing. And instead I'm sitting on my couch posting on reddit about all the fun I'm not going to have. Instead I'm calling my psychiatrist and we're probably going to increase one of my medications. I'm doing everything right, and it's a goddamn drag.

I just need to mourn a little bit. I'm letting go of so much. When I feel normal it's easy for me to say that I want to give up all of my mood episodes, but when I'm hypomanic (aka right now) I just want to stay on the roller coaster.

Does anyone else want to share stories? What have you had to give up? Was it worth it?

UPDATE:

So my psychologist called my psychiatrist (and I called my psychiatrist), and he told me to take xanax and add extra haldol if things get worse. I did stay in tonight (and stayed sober), and I had a good time with my friends anyway. We made late night burritos. The meds have helped a lot. I hope I feel better in the morning.

I know this may be kind of long, but I would really appreciate some advice. This community is the only place that I've got right now.**

In high school I had several friends. I wasn't really popular but there were a lot of people that I knew, and out of those friends there were some that I was sort of close with and some that I was *really* close with. The summer I graduated I kind of lost contact with all of these people. Not really intentionally, everyone just kind of disappeared on me.

I had one friend, Joe, who I didn't go to high school with. He and I met at church sometime around the 7th grade (which I am no longer a part of) and became best friends who were pretty much inseparable. He and I hung out a lot the summer after high school, right before I went off to college in Pittsburgh. Side note; I live in Ohio.

I met a great group of friends at college and we were thicker than thieves. We called ourselves the wolf pack, literally referring to us as this in public, and we went everywhere together. We did so much together and bonded so much over the course of just one year that we became friends for life, no matter where life would take us. Well, after freshman year my finances fell through and I was unable to attend college.

When I came back from college I didn't see any of the friends that I had from high school, and Joe had a new girlfriend so I only saw him about one time during the entire summer. I met my (current) girlfriend on an online dating site, bonded over the summer, and (in what could arguably be a manic and unwise episode) moved in with her at her home in Pittsburgh. During this time I remained in contact with my friends from college and even visited them one or two times, and tried to keep in contact with Joe but wasn't successful.

Some shit feel through and I had to move back to my home in Ohio. My girlfriend and I, in love, have chosen to stay together. She comes and sees me every two weeks, since I do not have a car (due to bipolar issues and financial issues). I have been home for five months and haven't really seen anyone yet. I have hung out with Joe one or two times in the entire five months that I have been home, just three or five times in the last year. That's about it.

I'm not sure what to do anymore. I'm getting really lonely sitting at home in a small town with my parents. I'm working a job at a local pizza shop, trying to save money to get my first car. I have been calling and texting people, and even sending messages on Facebook to try and get involved with them. So far people have either said ""we'll hang out"" and forget about me, say that they or busy, or just straight up lie to me so they don't have to hang out with me. I have literally caught people lying to me. I'm not really sure how to make new friends and there aren't any people my age (20) left in this town.

I'm really hopeless. I'm so alone that I'm having suicidal thoughts, the only thing keeping me here is my girlfriend (whom I only get to see maybe four days a month) and the fact that I'm paying student loans so my grandparents don't have to. It's literally gotten to the point that I've though about just jumping out in front of a train, I constantly wonder if the people that don't seem interested in me anymore would even miss me if I'm gone or if they would even *notice.*

I don't know what to do. Do I post a status on Facebook calling people out on their shit and telling them how alone and miserable I have felt and been for the last five months? Do I just give up and accept the fact that I am going to be living alone with my parents for the next two years?

Honestly, I'm almost as excited to be treated for that as I am to have help with being Bipolar.

I don't know a whole lot about ADHD other than I was one of those people who really doubted its existence because of over diagnosis. I have no reference for this but I think I have a pretty severe case of it. I scored very high in both categories on the test I took at the doctor and I feel like it has gotten worse through the years. Now I can barely play video games by myself, something I used to enjoy a lot. I've bought over 100 of them in the past 18 months (Steam sales...) and I might have beaten 5 tops. I can't concentrate on them. The same with movies, I never watch them by myself and struggle to make it through them with friends. I avoid 45 minute TV shows too, I can't sit through them, sorry Mad Men. And worst of all, I haven't been able to read but maybe one book a year since I was 13ish where I would read a book a week easily. ADHD affects my life in many more ways but it is concerning that even in recreational activities I am affected.

My questions:

1. Medication (adderal, etc) is the only treatment that I know of, is that pretty standard for ADHD? I am very structured and routined to keep myself sane, I'd think I'd be much worse off if I weren't. 

2. Does your treatment work? How well?

3. Anything I should know when it comes to ADHD?

I just feel like these people whom I really care about and want to hang out with, do stuff with, just be included in the fun, take advantage of me for my skills and equipment and stuff but never want to actually do anything with me.
I sit alone while they are out having fun, I sit alone while I let others use my stuff so that they can play music or whatever, I fix their technical problems and I do really just the boring shit that they dont want to do, nor have the skills to do.

They are all aware that I have Bipolar disorder and ADHD, they are all aware that my back is injured, they all ignore me unless they need something from me.

I don't have a significant feeling of mental malaise, I am not crying in bed or unable to shower or leave the house or anything like that; my main symptom is apathy and a lack of motivation. I also have anxiety, which has been pretty disruptive to my productivity lately, so I am not sure that that isn't the cause as well. I also can't be sure that the direct cause is my diagnosed problems, rather than my ability to cope with my circumstances. 

I have just been unable to talk myself out of the feeling that my mental health is pulling me back two steps for every one that I take forward; as a result I am feeling discouraged about the future. It makes me sad that I am intelligent, creative, and hardworking; but my potential and opportunities have been limited. 

I am super annoyed with myself that I can't curtail the effect of my mood and anxiety on my schoolwork. I am embarrassed that I haven't been able to meet my goals lately, and know that it is impacting my performance. I have been channeling all my energy and effort into my courses for a long time, and now I feel like other parts of my life are neglected and my grades are faltering anyways, leaving me feeling like I am in a lose-lose situation. I can't find the rationale for trudging on and on with the endless studying, causing me to feel really unhappy because I don't have much of a social life or leisure time for non-school activities, when my grades will be continue to be bad anyways. 

Maybe the healthy choice at this point is to just stop caring, have faith that I will find a career that I love that doesn't depend on a graduate degree (since I am unlikely to be accepted to any program), and try letting my grades go to some degree, in order to live life? I feel like I am torturing myself pointlessly, although I know most people who haven't experienced obstacles like this would urge me to continue grueling away for the sake of academic achievement. At the same time, it would be very hard to find it in myself to end my dedication to my classes, because intelligence and awesome grades were always my strength...what now?

Who else has felt this way? How do you cope with this feeling, or the reality, that bipolar and/or comorbid issues are chiseling away at your success in life, and therefore, your sense of well-being? 

Any tips or strategies from you guys that have found answers to this conflict would be so, so appreciated.

This illness is often kept under the carpet, so I often look at what others have had to deal with to help with my situation.  

I will begin,

My story-

As a child I had quite a normal middle-class upbringing with the exception of being violated (I have to keep the details it to myself here).  I was not accepted well in school.  I kept a lot to myself.  My feelings/emotions were always very high.  For example, when I had a girlfriend I was either very happy or very sad at the end.  When people made fun of me, it hit very hard.  As a guy, having feelings that show can be seen as a weakness, so I got pretty good at keeping my feelings to myself.  

Keeping feelings and things to myself proved to be beneficial.  In college, I was able to start anew and I strove to keep my feelings inside.  I was successful in college with good grades and working towards a degree.  I graduated and got married to a wonderful woman.  

Fast forward 7 years-  I had a house, a job, a beautiful and wonderful wife, four kids, and a lot of responsibility.  Things were going well at work, but the responsibilities were very high.  With four kids and a wife at home, it made for more stress with work/time/money.  That is when the breakthrough came in the form of panic attacks.  I had panic attacks (PAs) as a child, but only in claustrophobic situations.  These PAs would come on at the most inopportune times ie. during a presentation/performance review.  It got to the point that I had PAs daily.  One PA lasted over an hour.  I of course kept it all locked inside me until it started to affect my work and life to the point of not being able to function.  For 2 months I went from my main doctor to a psychiatrist to therapy.  I was given Xanax and Paxil.  Over the course of 4 years, I learned to deal with things.  With medication, I was able to manage the anxiety and depression symptoms. 

As a child, I wandered into viewing pornography a bit.  As a teenager with the hormones etc.  It had an amazing hook on me.  In my marriage, it was seen as by my wife as a horrible betrayal.  After some tough times in the bedroom, I found myself lured to the web for ""relief"" for lack of a better word.  The main problem in our bedroom has been my very high sex drive and her low sex drive (nothing new there).  

So there I am, late at night after the wife has been off to bed for hours, I am chatting with a woman from another state/time zone etc.  What starts as innocent banter turns sexual.  An online relationship forms.  I know what I am doing is wrong, I know that it would hurt my wife, but I do it anyway.  Chat turns to email, email to text, text to calling, calling to sexting.  One night my little internet friend sexts me while I am fast asleep.  My wife sees the message and, long story short our relationship is in tatters.  

Fast forward 3 weeks, I am driving to work, it's a cold November morning, the fog is lifting and the sun is coming up on the horizon.  Up ahead, there is a concrete cattle chute for loading cattle onto trucks.  I had a teacher that died from hitting one of those when his accelerator stuck.  I don't want to face people at work.  I don't want to face my wife at home.  A thought enters my brain-  Death would be better.

It's Friday, I have whiskey, beer, and xanax.  I mix them all.  The kids are in bed, we are arguing.  I say goodbye and that I'm sorry.  I never deserved you in the first place.  I am sorry, goodbye.

I'm in the hospital, psych ward.  These are not my clothes.  Where is my watch?  ""You tried to kill yourself sir.""  

""Anti-depressants aggravate manic states""

""Have you ever heard of Manic Depression/ Bipolar Disorder?""

""We are going to start you on Seroquel and Tegratol""

""What did they give you?  That shit will knock you out"" 

""I felt high sometimes, like I could not be touched, but then it all crashed like a falling glass full of water, I can't put it back together""

""People with Bipolar often act out with no regard for consequences, that is why drugs and alcohol can be so dangerous with a patient who is Bipolar""

""Come home""

I still have doubts about my condition.  The wife and I have worked things out to a degree, but some bridges can never be rebuilt.  I have been on and off my meds.  I know this is dangerous, but I have such a hard time with the zombie state the Seroquel keeps me in.

I am getting to that age where the talk of children is coming up more and more frequently. I am happily married to a non bipolar person who supports me in all my mood swings and such. 

I grew up the daughter of a single bipolar mother who was in and out of relationships with other people with mental health issues, and while I love my mom dearly now, her illnesses did have a huge impact on my childhood.

Now I am asking myself the question if I want to bring a child into this world who may end up diagnosed with the mental health issues I have, and would have to deal with my ups and downs I go through. As of right now I am stable, but that can and will change at any time. I don't know how a child would change that. My husband supports my choice either way, but I am still torn. 

So parents, non-parents, and everyone else; how has your BP affected your choice to become parents?

Even if you're convinced, realize that at conception it's a conspiracy theory web of speculation and that you *can't* base your actions on that shit. If in doubt, just assume the genius revelation is complete baloney and test it in ways that don't have consequences, like write an essay and ask a discerning friend to read it. If I can lay it out logically in an easy-to-follow way, and someone more sane than I can understand it or even agree with it, then *maybe* I'm on to something. 

If they have qualms, then seriously consider them. Don't just dismiss them. CONSIDER THEM. I'm probably making a logical leap somewhere. Remember that thing you posted on the Skeptics forums? That was the right thing to do, and it did sober you. Just don't take it so personally this time and be quicker to accept that the idea should be dropped.

   In the event that you still feel pretty good about the idea even after serious introspection and serious examination of critical advice, then the next step is to do nothing. Really, you're 9 in 10 chance deluded crazy coo-coo pants, and NO that does not mean you're 100% chance of being the 1 in 10. It means you're extremely likely to be deluded, so continue acting as if it's a simple delusion. Don't do anything I would regret. Don't do anything illegal. Don't spend money. Don't alienate yourself.

   How about you do something with this energy that the average person would agree is productive? Write a computer program. Write some fiction. Make some art. Learn a language. Learn some physics. Learn martial arts. Meditate. Cook. Make and sell crafts. You know, all those things that DO make average joes happy?

I'm hypomanic again which is really frustrating. I'm working on med changes with my doctor. Most likely we will drop the SNRI or SSRI out of my cocktail.  Even so, that will take a few weeks to see how that affects me. 

My biggest goals right now include not adding to our credit card debt, because I am spend happy.  Like browse Amazon and Sephora and Sally's Beauty and Ulta and Target for hours spend happy. And Dressbarn. God I want to buy some ridiculous, nearly gaudy jeans. Really brain? Really? 

I also want a puppy, but THAT sure as hell isn't happening. My dog doesn't need a puppy chewing his ear in his senior years. 

And I tried to noodle a novel concept for two hours and didn't get anywhere. Unfair! Hypomania is supposed to be creative land. I'm supposed to get some perks, damn it. If I'm going to stay up to 4 AM every night I would like to at least be writing. 

So no puppy, no jeans,  no good novel ideas, complete frustration with having to change meds, AGAIN.  Holidays sucking because my brother passed two years ago and my family doesn't know how to have holidays without him.  I had to have a friend come help me put up the Christmas tree because I just didn't have the heart for it, but it's expected, so up it goes. 

6 years later and I kinda figured I would have this all figured out, which I suppose I mostly do. It's just that I don't think I will ever reach that mythical place where the meds are just right and I get to be normal.

Im bipolar. I was diagnosed ten years ago with it but slipped through the cracks and was left to fend for myself. Over the past ten years Ive destroyed countless friendships and relationships and myself.

Starting at the beginning of this year the condition worsened to the point where i quite literally couldnt function and decided that it was time to get some real help. This is my experience.

I first completed a questionnaire the doctor gave me and was referred to a mental health care unit with Community Psychiatric Nurses and counselors. After meeting with a CPN i was told i needed to see a pdoc.  So my care was split into two places. PLACE 1 is the CPN action team with psychologists and counselors. PLACE 2 is the pdoc

PLACE 1 Told me i desperately needed to speak to a pyscholgist and would get me seen asap which should be within two months. That was in February. I am still waiting and have had no further contact off them.

PLACE 2 
Started seeing my pdoc who quickly re-diagnosed me with bipolar but refuses to tell me which type. The only notes he takes are on ripped up bits of paper on his desk and asked the EXACT same questions each time i see him. I am the one who has to tell him which medication i am on and what dosage as he doesnt know. 

So far in last ten years ive been given up to 14 different types of anti depressents to try. They send me completely loopy each time. Went toxic on 800 mg of lithium (my last visit to pdoc he tried prescribing me that again and i had to tell him i had already tried it and the outcome and his reaction was 'oh well, so youre not willing to try it again then!) Depakote made me extremely focused on suicide. Anti pyschotics i tried made me think i had a dragon curled up in my brain and i could feel it moving! Oh and Another low dose anti depressant which even the pdoc admitted had wrote the wrong dose out when doing the prescription and had overdosed me for two weeks which resulted in myself being extremely sick and having an 'episode'

The 'episode' im referring to is where i had completely lost control of my emotions for 48 hours and cried non stop, hurt myself, was frightened i was going to hurt my son and was hallucinating. When i rang 'the crisis team'at local mental hospital, i was told off for swearing down the phone. Apparently i said the word 'bloody' but have no recollection of doing so and then was told i was being silly and should take the tranqs the pdoc gave me. Oh i forgot to mention the diazepam and lorezpam i was given have absolutely no effect on me. 

So now I'm unmedicated been told by my pdoc that he has come to the end of types of medication he can try me on! but now only wants to see me every 4 months instead of fortnightly!

Yep unmedicated and doesnt want to see me because he cant fix me! Im going crazy, i cant concentrate i have a constant voice in my head telling me im a fat useless cow and bringing up old arguments, issues ive had in the past. Im agrophobic and most days even just getting washed is a chore. 

Seriously can someone suggest something? Anything i could try?  Please dont say i should smoke weed. I get that suggestion a lot. I have tried it briefly and it just makes me even more paranoid than normal. Im desperate for some help. Im sick of having a brain that wont shut up, being poor because ive spent all my money, loosing friends because i cant leave the house and my behaviour is unpredicatable, making my son frightened because he doesnt know which person im going to be on a day to day basis and basically im just tired of life. 

Theres got to be something out there than can help.

TL;DR let down by every health professional, now basically left with a mental disorder to cope on my own could do with some advice on where to go from here
