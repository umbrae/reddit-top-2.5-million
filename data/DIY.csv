I never did anything like this before but I love my mum a lot so I perhaps foolishly offered to sort her garden out.  The brief was 'low-maintenance'. I learned via the web and by asking people. 

Took about 10 weeks on my own.  The earth was clay like and full of large pieces of flintstone - i.e. impossible to get a spade in the ground...it was more like mining sometimes...scraping around embedded stones with a spoon to get them out! 

A few days I got in assistance: I got in a mini digger &amp; driver for a day, I got in a family friend for a couple of days to help when the patio stones went in &amp; to help hold the fence posts &amp; to help move the roll of grass into position. 

Otherwise all my own work :)

500 pics unedited version  - I can upload if there is demand

I'd like to add description to each pic explaining the materials/method but will take a long time..perhaps later..Happy to answer questions as they come for now.

The section at the side of the house where I was putting waste, I'm calling 'phase 2' - that's the project for this summer, I started yesterday &amp; it will have raised veg beds and bamboo. watch this space.

The poles are treated wood 'Unilog' 125mm diameter
The patio is Indian sandstone 'Raj Green'
The fake grass (which I still need to brush upright and pour in dry sand with a mechanical brusher to get it looking its best) is from Namgrass

edit1 - I should give credit to this site http://www.pavingexpert.com/ for much useful learning and I used their service for the randomised layout design for the patio - you send them a drawing with dimensions of the space and the info on the type of 'patio pack' of stone you have (sizes of slabs, usually 5 different sizes repeated, and quantity of each size) and they send you back a randomised layout. I learned the random layout is important for it to look great, one reason is that it avoids 4 edges of stone joining to make a cross - which the eye gets drawn to, in a bad way. When I learned this I was amazed to see how many pro portfolios had examples of this. Also a long line of edges - over2/3metres is bad news aesthetically.  Another layout option for these patio packs would have been to follow a fixed random pattern map from the supplier or elsewhere - that can be ok but they only give it for a small area - so for a larger area you have to repeat the pattern.

edit 2 - I used this site http://www.freecycle.org/ a lot to re-purpose un-needed things like the wood crates the stone came in, the flagstones from the old patio etc. Got things recycled and got them out the way.

edit 3 - A full on roman baths https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welwyn_Roman_Baths is a several hundred metres away...don't worry, I was looking out carefully for a roman safe ;)",,False,,t5_2qh7d,1369183373.0,,,True,t3_1erdrj,http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1erdrj/so_i_offered_to_make_my_mum_a_new_gardeni_think/,

Edit: People are asking for budget/costs, I bought the flat/apartment kinda cheap as it was in horrible condition. And when I bought material and stuff I compared with many different dealers, I also asked around to get the absolute best prices. It all ended around 12 000 USD.

1354286284.0,1520,self.DIY,141wo1,I ripped the old carpet off my stairs and painted a runner.  I think it turned out pretty good.,2172,652,207,http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/141wo1/i_ripped_the_old_carpet_off_my_stairs_and_painted/,"[Picture Album](http://imgur.com/a/mupoO)

So last Saturday I decided to rip the [old maroon nasty carpet](http://i.imgur.com/qEDBS.jpg) off my steps because I was tired of looking at it.  My original plan was to sand the steps down and re-stain them.  I quickly realized that it was going to take forever to sand all of the steps down so that they looked decent enough to stain.  It probably would have cost me $30 in sandpaper because the stairs had a bunch of [nasty glue and all sorts of crap](http://i.imgur.com/oDV9n.jpg) adhered to them.  So it was on to plan B - paint them.

I prepped the treads by sanding all of them down with 60 grit sandpaper using a belt sander.  The goal was to [get all of the nasty stuff off the treads](http://i.imgur.com/0GWcg.jpg) so that the paint would go on with a somewhat smooth finish.

After that, I [painted the sides of the treads white](http://i.imgur.com/3PPyf.jpg).  FYI, if you're going to do this, paint the entire tread and don't leave out the middle part like I did.  It just forces you to put more coats of paint on later.

From here, the idea was to mark the middle of every step and then measure from the middle outward so that every runner was the same width.  Any variances in the step sizes (which there were by very small amounts) would be absorbed by the outer white paint.  

After marking the middle of the steps, I used a ruler that I had marked at certain points to make pencil marks on the treads for where the three strips of tape needed to go.  I marked this off on the front and the back of the treads so that the tape would be straight.  I also caulked all of the gaps on the steps at this point because I forgot to do it earlier.  I then painted all of the trim and spots I caulked with white.

With all of the marking done, putting the tape on the treads was fairly straightforward.  I just lined up each piece of tape so that it was on the pencil marks and [everything came out perfectly straight](http://i.imgur.com/dHt7l.jpg) (except the picture I took).

Now with all of the treads taped, my strategy was to simply connect the tape pieces on the risers making sure they lined up.  Since my other measurements were very accurate, this proved to be a good strategy as it [worked out well](http://i.imgur.com/kFXtH.jpg).  

Also, it's important to make sure your tape is really pushed down in the corners.  I used the end of a ruler to push the tape into all of the corners where the treads meet the risers and it worked very well.

Let me just point out that to say all of this taping was a pain in the ass would be an understatement.  It's extremely tedious and it took a while to do.  You're also bent over in a weird position or sitting on hard steps most of the time.  It wasn't fun.

Anyway, 3M recommends painting a coat over the tape to ""seal"" it so that other paint doesn't bleed in messing up your lines.  So I did just that and painted some more white paint over the tape.  After that dried, I went ahead and started [painting every other step](http://i.imgur.com/jrTmW.jpg) (so the steps were still accessible somewhat) with the color I used for the runner.

Of course, at this point my wife calls an audible and decides we should [paint the outside runner a different color](http://i.imgur.com/gmDcn.jpg).  No big deal really but just more work.

I let the paint dry for about 10 hours and then began ripping the tape off.  There isn't much strategy to this other than going slow and stopping if the tape starts to pull off any paint.  3M recommends running an exacto knife on the tape line if that starts to happen but it didn't for me (perhaps because I ""sealed"" the tape by painting over it like 3M recommended).  There were however two spots that the tape pulled up some of the white paint underneath but that was an easy touch-up repair.

[Here it is with all of the tape removed](http://i.imgur.com/rawtM.jpg).  

The next step is to put some type of water-based polyurethane over all of the steps to protect the paint but I'm going to wait a few weeks to do that so that the paint can really cure.  Behr says it takes 4 weeks for their enamel based paints to cure.

Of course, this is just one part of the process of fixing the hallway.  As you can see by the last picture, the flooring upstairs now sticks out like a sore thumb so I may just paint that edge white and I'll probably do the same for the handrail.  The walls also need to be painted to because now that the steps have a fresh coat of white paint on them, the walls look yellow.

The total cost for all of this was approximately $60.

Last winter my brother called me to tell me that my parents neighbor had passed away and that his kids were there at his house selling all his stuff AND that one of the things was this old sad tiny boat called an Addictor (1985) and wanted to know if I wanted it. I said no, I had no time for yet another project and despite its low price ($500) which if the motor ran, would be worth it, I just didnt have time for another thing to do. So a week later I go to my parents house and as I pull into the driveway, there sits this boat. My brother had bought it for $400. As soon as I saw it I realized I had made a mistake. This thing was super cool, or at least could be with some work. Long story short, my brother regretted buying it as he has no place to work on it, so I bought it from him right there for the $400 he paid. I drug it home and started in on it that day. After a good pressure washed my girlfriend and I accessed the situation. We had no idea if the motor ran, the seat was completed rotted, the steering and throttle cables were completely frozen up, really everything had to be replaced or repaired from what we could see. After tearing out the seat, we realized that the floor was completely rotted. Anyway, the work started. We replaced the floor, injected new closed cell foam under the flooring, installed all new steering, rack and pinon, cable, throttle cable, carpet, added a bilge pump, installed new bilge drain hoses, built new teak OS handle, had the throttle leaver assembly media blasted and powder coated, had a new seat made, installed a new batter and battery box, installed new battery cables, installed tie down hooks to the outside of the boat, installed new gunnel trim (second to last picture still shows old trim however). The paint we used was a ""roll and tip"" epoxy which turned out amazing. You wouldn't guess in a million years that this paint job was rolled on.  We still however need to finish striping it. The stripes will match the seat along the whole top of the boat. As an added bonus, once we found a new key (It didn't come with one so we actually finished the entire boat before knowing if the engine ran) the motor fired right up and runs strong. For those of you wondering, it goes 35mph wide open and planes up fairly fast with me and my lady in it, and I weigh 220 Lbs. 

Edit,  A couple people asked for a video, so here it is.

I am handy, but I've never done most of this stuff before so it was a total learning experience. I laid my first hardwood floor and finish, put up my first wainscoting, first tilework ceiling, and a bunch of other stuff. 

I had a blast putting it all together, but it isn't done yet. I'm interested to see what Reddit thinks is missing from a Victorian-ish Sherlock inspired office. I am building a trap door bookshelf out of the closet, but I feel like I need more trap door/hidden compartments stashed around.

Besides, read the right hand bar, people:

If it's just pictures of your finished adarondack chairs, that's as useful as going to www.ikea.com and looking there.

1345645721.0,898,self.DIY,ymzyd,How can Samsung get away with this? Enrage level:10/10,1526,628,680,http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/ymzyd/how_can_samsung_get_away_with_this_enrage/,"To preface my story, I have a 55 inch LCD Samsung television I bought about 2 and a half years ago for around $2000 with a hanging stand. I have had zero problems with it until last week.

I arrived home from a few drinks with friends and decided I would unwind and watch some tv. I turn it on, everything is fine. I watch for about 5 minutes and my tv starts strobing. Not pleasant to look at and definitely unwatchable. There is a youtube video of it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAXCXX8b6C8). Needless to say I was concerned but a little too tipsy to do anything about it then. I thought it was my Cable box and decided to turn it off and deal with it the next day.

The next day I unplugged everything from the tv and after about 5 minutes it starts to strobe again. At this point I got a really bad feeling inside and $2000 started strobing in my head. I decide to do some research online and see that this is a common problem. Common as in thousands of people have expressed concern over this but a lot of them got it fixed inside the warranty period. 

I call Samsung and they basically laugh at me. It has been two and a half years and my $2000 dollar tv is no longer working. They say they can not do anything and they have never heard of this problem before. I explain that there are people voicing this exact problem all over the internet and there is no way they have not heard of this. They send me to some customer complaint department that gives me the same runaround. 

So I'm sitting there with a strobing tv and Samsung not giving a shit and telling me to contact a repairman from their repair department or maybe some contract company they use to service their tv's. I don't remember because my blood was boiling at this point. I gave them a piece of my mind, they shrugged it off and said their apologies and I hung up. 

I start to read some more reviews online and FINALLY stumble upon a [youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZwQ0gRQ9sg) that explains what the problem is and how to fix it. The most enraging part about this is it took me 15 minutes total to fix the issue. The longest part was unscrewing the television and insuring it's safety. Clipping the jumper literally took 3 seconds once it was easily located.

Even more maddening is in those same reviews when a repair man came in he fixed it the exact same way I did except charged 300 dollars or more. How can this be happening?

I posted this to vent but also to save anyone with the same problem the hundreds of dollars it would cost to fix a problem you can fix yourself in less than 20 minutes. This happens on 55"" and 46"" LCD TV's.

I used to love Samsung. I have 2 LCD's, and a Blu-Ray player. Is the support for all electronics this bad? Are all electronics built to fail to grab extra money from the consumer?

TL;DR Samsung knows there is a problem inside their TV's. Won't take responsibility for it, and flat out denies the problem even exists. Despite there being thousands of others with the same problem.

I won motherfuckers!,1161,352,238,http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/mh7jd/fuck_samsung_and_their_planned_obsolescence_i_won/,"My Samsung LCD tv recently stopped powering on.  I googled a bunch and found that it is a known issue with Samsung LCDs, namely that a capacitor on the power supply is rated with too low a voltage to last any longer than the warranty.  

Easy enough to replace the capacitor and get the thing working again right?  No, Samsung refuses to provide a diagram of the tv's insides and makes the case a clamshell with hidden screws everywhere.  I had to break the stupid thing to get it open, all to replace a single component on the power supply.  Thankfully I was able to get the tv working again, after much frustration.  

It's this kind of hostility toward the customer that makes it so hard to do DIY repairs on consumer goods anymore; Samsung literally engineered this tv to break after the warranty expired, forcing any less tech savvy person to throw away perfectly good hardware (but for a single piece) and get an entirely new tv.  Samsung literally engineered a piece of garbage and rented it to me.  Fuck Samsung, and fuck any manufacturer that does this.  I want to tear out the corporate officers hearts and feed it to them.

[Here's an album of some of the work in progress](http://imgur.com/a/S5UCU#55)

* The first thing I did was clean the outside of the cabinet with a 1:10 vinegar/water solution, and dry each panel thoroughly with a cotton cloth to prevent discoloration of the lacquer.
* Next, I removed the front panels, fall board, name board, the action and keys. It took all of 6 screws, and 3 nuts to remove all of these parts. Be sure to disconnect the lever that attaches to the inner-workings of the damper pedal before lifting out the action.
* Next, I vacuumed the inside of the cabinet, along the harp and key bed as well as the action as good as I could. I then used an air compressor to blow out any remaining dust, and vacuumed it up. The inside of the cabinet, and the holes in the harp still needed to be wiped down with a vinegar/water solution to get it ‘dust free’. I also used compressed air to gently clean dust from all the action parts, as they are very fragile, and I didn’t have the hundreds to thousands of dollars to replace all the hammers and other action parts. 
* Next, I removed all the key pin and balance pin punchings, and used a metal polish to clean the pins. I used this metal polish to also clean all of the other metal parts inside the piano, excluding the harp, tuning pins and strings. I replaced the key pin, and balance pin punchings, and adjusted them accordingly. 
* Next, I used a soft nail brush dipped into clear water to clean all the piano keys. Be especially careful to not introduce too much moisture to the keys. MANY bad things can happen, such as ivory lifting, or keys warping, and no longer fitting back into the piano. If they don’t need to be cleaned (ie, having something sticky spilled on them), I suggest just wiping down the ivory/ebony or acrylic and drying with a cotton cloth.
* Next, I removed the old name board felt, and replaced it with a new felt using a small amount of glue, and just placing it felt side down on a flat surface to dry. 
* The piano was then re-assembled in reverse order. It was also tuned, voiced, replaced a few strings, and a few things I'm likely forgetting...!

Next: to create a piano bench...

It seems to me that everyone that posts pretty pictures of something they built gets a great deal of attention and upvotes.  Meanwhile those who post questions get almost no attention, and actual how-to articles are almost non-existent.

I have taken to going down the line and upvoting every legitimate question or interesting article link, and yes even those look what I did posts (when they actually explain how they did things).

Am I wasting my time? Do I have the wrong expectation of this group? Should I migrate to r/crafts or something?

Just wanted to vent and or hear your ideas.

I have no experience with this sort of thing, but like all of us here in r/DIY, that’s no deterrent. As I got on with the job, I inevitably came up against hurdles, but as I worked on, I came to the realisation: overcoming these is the best thing about tinkering! And it’s why you never throw away the leftover parts…

‘How do I remove the old unit?’ ‘Wait, I have that stubby little screwdriver in the other tool box, that’ll work…’  


‘How do I attach my lead to this old cable?’ ‘I’m pretty sure I’ve got some old connectors lying around somewhere from a previous job, I bet I could press one of those into service.’  


‘Now, where did I leave them? It’s got to be somewhere in this box….’  

Fun times… 

So, all together now: “I’ll keep that; you never know, it could come in useful one day…”

EDIT: So what I thought of as just a little post about having the right tool or fixing to hand has turned into a mass confession/therapy session!

I sanded it down and sprayed it with a very hard coating.

Btw. i still got some i did not use by myself or gave to friends lying around. Does anyone know if its legal to sell those on ebay?

edit: to all those who would like one. i don't got them at my appt. I could check out how many left at the weekend. I could post pictures then and think how much it costed me to make them to get a price.
Damn i have to sleep 2am here in germany, 4h sleep left :(

edit: i came up with the idea because i needed a nice gift for my mom(thats me and my brothers):

edit: i think 30 USD incl. shipping (wich is like 6€ or 7,8 usd incl. tracking) sounds reasonable. Since there is so much positive response i am thinking of doing more w/o the apple logo. If you want anything else instead or blank tell me.

We worked on the house Mondays - Thursdays from 6 am -1 pm and then went to work from 3 pm - 11 pm. Fridays  and Saturdays we had off from work so we worked on the house from 6 am - 8 pm. Sundays I worked mid day so we did not work on the house.


My wife, my father-in-law, my father, and myself did almost everything. The only things we did not do is the shingles, installing the furnace and ducting, and the drywall mudding and taping. My brother-law- is a certified electrician  so he was nice enough to do the electrical. We got a great deal on garage and driveway pouring so we did not do that. Other wise we did everything else.

It took only 6 months from the day we demolished the old house to the day we moved in to the new house.

Here is the album. They are not up to date, but I will add more once I get them
http://homebuild.imgur.com


Edit: I have update the album with the last of the pictures that we have taken.
I should have mentioned that my wife and I are not carpenters by trade. I work with computers and she works as  a health care aid. We did not know what we where getting into when we started.


Edit: We are not quite done the outside. It got to cold to do any of the masonry. Under the Green siding, we are going to put stone for the front half, and stucco the rest of the house. 

We did work off of a plan that my father-in-law had.

For us who rarely used a hammer before this it was quite neat...all be it stressful. This is how the build went;
show up at site.....get told what we need to do for the day. Father - in - law would usually have to go to work for a few hours, so we would work. He would come back and either help us redo stuff we did incorrectly or start working on something new. 

People would asked what we are doing next, or why we did it this way and all we could do was shrug and say that is the way we were told to do it, or I have no Idea we find out tomorrow what we are doing next.

I got to say looking back i really had fun building the house, but would have never said it at the time. We were temporarily living in a house that had started being built in the 1800's, which had no air conditioning. We had no free time. We were always tired because we would start  6 am and be done our paying jobs at 11 pm. But we love the house and would not have done it any other way.
