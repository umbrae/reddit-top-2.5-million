I will confess that early in my investing career something very similar happened to me.

Its too bad you deleted the post, it would have served well as a warning to others.

I will repeat it here for those that missed it.

Summary of OP's tale of woe: 

Guy buys EVCA at $0.0002 (he says 0.0001, but that is highly unlikely). The common thought process here for the uninformed is that the stock can not possibly get any cheaper.

Well, it turns out that it can.

EVCA does a reverse split, (1:20?) and the stock now trades at $0.03. OP does not keep up with news events, misses all the press releases and checks stock price today to see that his investment *should* be $29K! Woohoo! \o/

First reaction is to post to r/investing that you are a $29thousand-a-niare! For this we thank you for thinking of us first, even before you checked your account balance! 

What happened here is EVCA (currently EVCAD, the fifth letter ""D"" indicates a new issue, in this case it means the stock has reverse split and new dumping of shares will commence) reverse splits, then issues a mess more shares, diluting existing shareholders to nothing. Insiders then issue themselves new shares at the new price and proceed to dump it on unsuspecting buyers. And so the cycle repeats in the world of penny scams.

This is the real deal, from reading the tape for 5 years.

1.  If a stock is being hit by accounting issues, SHORT IT, preferably with option spreads or diagonals 2-3 months out.  Rarely do they ever recover right away.

2.  If you want to get into a stock during a correction, wait for the first UP DAY before even think about getting in.  If the stock is below 50 EMA, then sell as soon as it fails the retest at 50 EMA if it gets there.  Keep holding if it busts through 50 EMA.  (20 EMA is the first test)

3.  The above statement does NOT work as well for identifying tops.  TOPS are FAR MORE DIFFICULT to catch, and it's a loser's game.  

4.  If a stock reaches 52 week highs based on 1-2% gains a day, DO NOT short it.  They go even higher most of the time.  (How did apple get to 600?  by hitting 52 week highs day after day)

5. However, parabolic moves are worth catching, but wait for the first down day, while keeping an eye on 50 EMA support.  TZOO april 2011 is a fine example.

6.  If a stock keeps hitting support repeatedly, short it.  May 2010, BP, after the oil spill.  

7.  Don't even pay attention to P/E.  It's a pretty worthless metric.  I've seen it over and over again where folks use P/e to justify their purchase.  I've yet to see P/e move to their imagination.

8.  Don't make decisions during the day.  Plan it out when the market is closed.  

Edit:

9.  This one is often overlooked.  Keep more money in your bank account than trading account.  It feels good knowing you have more cash elsewhere.  This takes off a lot of stress psychologically.

Edit:

- Don't trade earnings.  Extensive DD may increase your chances but even then it's complete gambling.
- If you're going to speculate with options, buy spreads, which aren't as effected by time decay.  Buying OTM singles is the easiest way to lose money.
- If you ever catch yourself worried about your position, you probably committed too much of your capital.  Get used to have a position so small relative to your total account value that it's almost a waste of time.  E.g., $200,000 account, with only $3k in a trade.
-  Before you enter a position, know your exit.  If you shorted or went long at the 50 EMA, and the next day it busts through, know right away if you're going to exit or hold at the open, to end of day and exit, or hold for 3 more days then exit.  If you lose, you lose.  Go on to the next trade.  

Edit:

This isn't the end all be all to trading, which doesn't exist.  No, this is barely scratching the surface.  There's a few that have mentioned the best way to go about making money from the markets and outperforming the S&amp;P is to understand fundamentals, balance sheets, cash flow.  This is completely true, but, this is just ONE of the many skills you can have at your disposal.  Besides, if a company has great fundamentals, chances are it's making 52 week highs and you would've already known that from the technicals.

Think of it this way - how many of you understand the mechanics of Diablo from Blizzard?  There are items in the game that improve certain attributes, adding % chance.  Trading, and life in general, works in similar ways.  Every bit of knowledge, every bit of experience, adds to your % chance of winning a trade, but you will never reach 100%.  Understanding fundamentals will certainly help, which goes back to my #1 lesson learned of don't buy into stocks that have had accounting issues.  (DMND, GRPN so far at least, LFT)

In the coming days, I will walk through some annotated charts putting what I've learned in action.  I am doing this because I genuinely enjoy it, and some of what I learned has been taught to me by a mentor I met while posting on yahoo so I want to pay it forward.  He has since died from a heart attack.

Edit:

- Just saw this today on MNST and it reminded me - do not initiate a long position when a takeover rumour is out.  99.9% of the time takeovers don't leak.

Sorry for not updating.

I'm still holding my 500 MCD position. Like I said [in my previous posts](http://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway50k/submitted/) I had a good faith in MCD. This company just can't go anywhere. Today's stock price shows that. The stock is at $103.62.

I didn't write any calls since my last update but I did collect $385 dividend in December and $385 dividend in March.

Totals by month so far:

* Month 1: $980

* Month 2: $897.5

* Month 3: $322.5

* Month 4: $72.5

* Month 5: $357.5

* Month 6: $87.5

* Months 7 - 9: $350 (dividend on 500 shares of MCD).

* Months 10 - 12: $385 (dividend on 500 shares of MCD).

* Months 13 - 14: $385 (dividend on 500 shares of MCD).

Grand total: $3,837 ($274 average/month).

If I was to sell the stock today, I'd cash $103.62\*500 = $51,805. I bought the stock for about $100, so I'd profit $1,805 ($100\*500 - $103.62\*500). That would bring the grand total at $3,837 + $1,805 = $5,642, which is $403 average per month!

Had I written some calls in months 10 - 14, the average would be closer to $440 or $450, which is really close to the goal of $500 per month. I'll make a bold statement at this point and say that *it is possible to make close to $500 per month with $50k writing calls*.

I'll try to get myself together today and I'll sell some part of my portfolio and diversify my stock, so that I don't run in the issues I had earlier when the stock fell too much and I was unable to profit much from the covered calls.

It all started when I read [this post by CarlSagan79](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oe86p/heres_how_to_make_500month_in_passive_income_on/).

My portfolio currently consists of 500 shares of MCD that I purchased at $100.

Last month I collected $350 in dividends, and only $7.50 on covered calls because MCD's price had fallen significantly below $100 so writing $100 calls didn't yield much.

So total cash collected last month: $357.50.

Totals by month so far:

* Month 1: $980

* Month 2: $897.5

* Month 3: $322.5

* Month 4: $72.5

* Month 5: $357.5

Grand total: $2630. ($526 per month on average).

This month (Jun-Jul) I followed [uwastemytime's advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tz6xd/i_read_how_to_turn_50k_into_500_passive_income/c4qysdg) and on Monday I wrote 5 July $95 contracts at $0.21 a piece. Cash made: $105. Fees: $17.50. Total: $87.5.

I'm taking a significant risk here because if MCD reaches $95, my stock will be exercised and I'll have all my 5 month earnings basically wiped out as I bought the stock at $100, and it would get exercised at $95. I don't think that will happen this month though. 

As you can see, I'm still averaging over $500 a month over 5 months, which is good. Though the next month the average will fall below $500.

I personally could do without them, but /r/investing isn't here for me.  We're here to serve you.  So I've decided to let you guys, the beautiful readers of this sub make the decision for me.  Your choices are:

1.  Let the memes go, and quit taking ourselves so seriously.  This is /r/investing we will let the free market of upvotes determine whether a post succeeds, without meddling from the mods.  Vote for this if you can't wait to stick it to the man by upvoting a picture of the MS logo with a Louis Vuitton hat on.

2.  Delete them and send them to hell/spam queue.  If you vote for this, please leave a comment about what guidelines should be used, and what should, or should not be allowed.

3.  Allow self posts only.  This has been used by other subs to cut down on karma whoring.  Links would still be allowed, they would just have to be placed in the body of the text.

Data seems to agree with the hypothesis that this is profitable. 

About a month ago I made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1dg0xf/buying_the_10_day_low_a_back_test/) detailing a trading strategy that bought on lows and sold on highs, I did some more analysis involving a ‘base case’ and ended up with some interesting results. I really just wanted to see what everyone thinks of my analysis.

**Signals**

Strategy: Buy when a stock has reached a new 10 day low and is trading above its 50 and 200 day moving average.  Sell when the price reaches a new 10 day high, drops below the 50 day moving average, or has been open for 10 days. 

Base case: Buy a random stock at its close and hold for a random period between 1 and 10 days. 


**Analysis Parameters:**

* Initial Investment: $5,000
* Trading Fees: 3.95 (OptionsHouse)
* Slippage:  [99.5%, 100.5%] of the target price
* Trials: 10,000

**Methodology**

The program begins by back testing a predefined set of tickers (SP500 in this case) using the buy and sell signals listed above. In order to reduce biased results I ‘walk’ through the time period, that is I fed the program a single day at a time. Each day I calculated buy signals and if the conditions were met I'd purchase the security, hold it, and continue to cycle through each proceeding day and calculated sell signals.
Once the security was bought and sold I'd write down the trade and move onto the next day. The end result was a list of every single trade that could have potentially occurred in the predefined date range with the predefined list of tickers.

I'd sort these entries by purchase date in ascending order (oldest first) and every trade that fell on the same day was put into a list and archived in a dictionary with key-word purchaseDate. The result was a data structure I could query and pull a list of all trades that could have occurred on a specified date.

I then had all the information I needed to begin the actual back test. I began with the first possible purchase date, searched the dictionary to obtain a list of all possible trades that could have occurred on that day, chose one at random, wrote down the trade's information, and moved onto the next available purchase date.

Once all dates were exhausted I calculated an annual return by finding the product of all the year's trades. I did this 10,000 times in order to obtain the average and standard deviation of annual returns. Since my data didn't tell me which trade occurred when it was impossible for me to define the exact sequence of trades. My idea was if I got enough random trade sequences I could create a universe of possible scenarios with the most likely being the most prevalent -- it was a way for me to calculate a return and cover all my bases at the same time.",,False,,t5_2qhhq,1370475442.0,,,True,t3_1fr0z8,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fr0z8/analysis_of_a_trading_strategy_buy_the_10_day_low/,

Back in the late 90's I was your typical university student, I was already involved in the stock market, mostly airline stocks for some reason (word of advice, airline stocks are the walking dead of the stock market world, they all going bankrupt at some point! lol).

I can't remember if it was on the Yahoo boards, but some person was asking if anybody could design a website. I was proficient with notepad and html, so I replied back to the guy that I could make him a site for a few hundred bucks. Being a student, this would go a long way in topping up my gas tank and paying for a few drinks at the bar that weekend.

He accepted my offer and I whipped up a very simply one page site on some free hosting service, I think it was geocities (remember that?).

The site was about mining stocks, which were all the rage in the mid 90's because of a company called [Bre-X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bre-X). That in itself is another amazing story that we should discuss at some time.

I got paid for the site and then got a small monthly fee to keep it updated with what ever material he would send me, usually press releases on the four to five companies on the site. I never gave it much thought, I had no interest or knowledge about mining companies.

The next request I got from him was to start a newsletter so that people that visited the site could enter their email and we could send out email alerts rather than wait for them to come see news on the site. This was a new and great idea at time! He was not very computer savvy so he would send me the newsletter and ask me to send it out.

The guy was a terrible writer, lots of spelling mistakes, bad punctuation and horrible grammar. I felt bad sending out his newsletters without fixing them up first, so I started editing his material. 

Before I knew it, I was writing newsletter on mining stocks, thus began my journey into the world of penny stock promotions!

While my activities were limited to updating a website and writing or re-distributing material for clients, I did get to see how some major IR firms (investor relations firms for penny stocks are basically the promoters, I use these terms interchangeably) operate. And yes, it's worse than you thought!

By the late 90's and early 2000 I was mostly out of the penny stock business, the tech bubble had begun and I had moved onto large caps at that point. 

Have you wondered why or how these small caps pop and drop?

Have you ever received some mailer with information on a stock that looked too good to be true?

I am here to answer your questions about the shady and moldy underbelly of the small cap markets! AMA!

1326393878.0,212,self.investing,oe86p,"Here's how to make $500/month in passive income on with $50,000 using covered calls",262,50,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oe86p/heres_how_to_make_500month_in_passive_income_on/,"This strategy combines collecting dividends along with premiums from writing [covered calls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covered_call).

First, we need a relatively stable stock that pays relatively high dividends.  Stocks that are largely [institutionally owned](http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/investing/institutional-ownership-975) tend to be relatively low risk investments and will also tend to have lower swings compared to market in general.

[I compiled a list of stocks from the S&amp;P 500 that meet this criteria.](http://imgur.com/qFtaU)

I chose LMT because it has the lowest volatility of any of the stocks seen here.  It's presently at 81.07, its three year low is 68.79 and its three year high was 86.90.  As volatile as this market has been, this really isn't that much.  [Over the past year, except for August and its subsequent recovery, LMT has actually stayed in a rather narrow band between 79 and 82 a share.](http://imgur.com/5tAsS)

LMT, at the time of this writing, sells for 81.07 a share.  $50,000 gets us 600 shares.  We could actually buy a little more than 600 shares, but options are sold in lots of 100, so it's only useful to us to buy in lots of 100.

Now we consider the dividends.  They recently raised their dividend to $1.00/share.  It was last paid on Nov 29th and will be paid again around Feb 28.  

Our 600 shares will net $600 in dividends every quarter (600 * 1).

Now for the option premium.  Now that we own 600 shares, we can sell someone the right to buy them from us for a period of time.  One agrees on both an expiration date and a price, known as the strike price.  An option won't get exercised (i.e., the stock bought away from you) if the stock doesn't reach the strike price.  As such, for LMT, we'd want to set a strike price of about $82.50.  It's far enough away from the current market price that given the volatility it won't be at that price in 2-3 months.

Ideally we also want to sell this option right up to the next dividend payment, so we'll be picking options that expire in February.  [Here's the option chain for Feb.](http://imgur.com/EJl3D)

The current market price for Feb options at $82.50 go for $1.23.  This is per option share.  So for 600 options, you'd make a premium of $738 (600 * 1.23).

Once those options expire, you sell more options right up to the [ex-dividend date](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex-dividend_date).  On that date, the stock usually drops equivalent to the dividend payout, or in this case about $1.  It'll recover, but that'll take time and will give you extra room in making sure your calls don't get exercised.

In summary:  $50,000 gets you 600 shares of LMT.  Quarterly dividends will be $600.  Earned covered call premiums will be $738 quarterly.  Total quarterly income will be $1,338 or $446/month.

Risks to this approach are that if the stock declines, the value of your portfolio will decline.  This isn't necessarily too bad unless you really need the money.  As this strategy is based on money made from dividends and options, so long as the dividend payout doesn't change much, you're still covered.

Another risk is if the stock takes off for whatever reason.  If the company's stock skyrockets, your sold options will get exercised.  Your shares will be bought away from you (at a profit, but not much) and you'll miss most of the run-up of the stock.

I've always maintained a stock market account with a line of credit secured against it so that I could act quickly on property purchases.  For the past several years I've taken advantage of extremely attractive interest rates to finance my properties to their maximum LTV and invested that equity back into stocks.  I also keep a separate options account with a much smaller balance for more short-term or possibly speculative plays, but a very large part of my work for the last several years has been stock investing.

I consider myself a primarily long-term “value” investor but I will happily pursue a position in any stock I feel is under-priced so long as I understand the business and feel I have a better-than-average grasp of the companies near-term potential.  In the last 9 years I have beaten the SP500 6 times, twice by &gt;10%, and never been behind by more than 5% in any single calendar year.

1328514999.0,192,self.investing,pcy9o,Finance/Investing 001: some basics,215,23,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pcy9o/financeinvesting_001_some_basics/,"Some of the posts in this reddit seem to be running way too big for their britches, and way outsmarting themselves. Boiling down to basics, here are the ways that you put money to work:

- **Strict ""Investment""** means purchasing a stream of future income. Classic examples are farmland, apartment buildings, drilling rights, bonds, private lending, corner stores, factories, intellectual property, anything that generates ongoing income. 

- **Speculation**  means buying something because you think that someone will pay more for it at a later date. This includes comic books, precious metals, raw real estate, fine art, baseball cards, orange-juice futures, beanie-babies... anything that might change in value. 

Note that many ""investments"" also have speculative value (positive or negative)-- some apartment buildings have a lot more resale value than others, separate from the rent they collect. This is neither good nor bad, it's just important to know why you're buying. 

On with the lesson...

- **Arbitrage** is buying a thing that can be instantly re-sold at a higher price. An example might be buying a classic car (say, a '57 Chevy) in a place with a car-friendly climate (say, Arizona), and then re-selling it in Boston or NYC to a wealthy collector. Or buying $15 Wrangler blue jeans at Wal-Mart in the US and re-selling them in Amsterdam boutiques for 50 euros. More typically, in finance, it means things like exploiting currency or bond-rate differentials, i.e., you find a currency that is trading at one rate relative to the dollar, another rate relative to the yen, and you buy yen, then use the yen to buy the target currency, then use the target currency to buy back more dollars than you spent, stuff like that. This is mostly what bond-traders do for a living, and you usually need to have massive sums of money at stake for it to be worthwhile, but clever operators can often find arbitrage opportunities in inefficient markets such as real-estate or collectibles. As always, speculative elements can be a big factor. 

- **Insurance and derivatives** are ""investments"" or financial positions that are completely disconnected from any underlying asset. Let's say that you want to start a lemonade stand, and you find an *investor* willing to put up the cash in exchange for half the profits. Your neighbor tells the investor, ""hell, you should have given me the money, and I'll pay 60% of the profits, because that lemonade stand is never gonna make a dime!"" I overhear this, and I say to your neighbor, ""Hey, I actually think the lemonade stand is a good idea. If you're serious, I'll match if the investment and write you a check in return for you paying me half the future profits."" If he agrees, then he and I have created a ""derivative contract"". This is a pure side-bet, there is no underlying asset, no jobs will be created, he and I are just playing the odds. **Insurance is exactly the same thing.** 

None of the above are better nor worse than others. They are all ways to make or to lose money, depending on how smart or lucky you are. What matters is to know and understand what you are buying and why. 

Finance is full of flim-flam and complicated language that makes things sound fancy and important, and brokers, advisers, and other people with esoteric-sounding job-titles are experts at making you think that this or that complicated-sounding thing has somehow outsmarted the laws of market economics. They have fancy suits and business cards, just like car-salesmen (not to mention drinking problems and fake tans). If you feel intimidated and confused while talking to them, that's the point. 

Same with online forums like this: half the people are throwing around a bunch of fancy-sounding claptrap while living in rented apartments and a month behind on their car-payments. Investors are like lotto players, they brag about how they won $5,000 in a day, but leave out how they lost $20,000 in a year. 

I'm not telling you what to buy or not buy. I'm saying that there are only so many ways to make money, and that what matters is that you *understand* how your cash outlay is supposed to generate returns.

""It's too good to be true"" is not axiomatic. The ""deal of a lifetime"" comes along about once a week for those who know where to look, and who have the cash to deploy. But the ripoff of a lifetime comes along about once a second for people who can be talked into outsmarting themselves. Discernment means understanding what you are buying, and how and why it will make money.

So let me provide some background:

I use fundamental analysis to pick which stocks to buy and technical analysis to pick my entry point.

I’m aiming for a return, on each trade, of about 30%.

I will sometimes use options for better returns, but will usually choose one that is a few months away to lower my risk. 

My goal: $3000 to $1,000,000. If I average 30% per trade, I will hit my goal after about 20 trades. I aim for each trade to take no more than 3 weeks.

Here is my progress so far:

My brother-in-law is not a very well educated investor.  He's one of these people that knows just enough to be dangerous and is always looking for the ways to make 1000% profits.  So far it's been trading small amounts of somewhat well known stocks and trying to market-time things with no success.  My sister tolerates this because it hasn't touched their retirement or savings.

But starting last week, he's been asking my advise on this OTC stock called Cellceutix.  (OTCBB: CTIX).  With barely even looking at the stock I told him to stay clear.  After some more emails, I looked in to it further and I still think it's way too risky, there's not enough outside info, and just smells bad. (Sorry for the lack of fundamental insight, but I don't know which numbers I can trust).

So last night I get a call from my sister saying that he's getting ready to put a sizable portion of their savings into this stock and she's worried about losing most or all of it.  And I think she's right.  The only thing that will stop him at this point is if I can find multiple solid reasons to avoid this stock.  So I'm asking for some help because I'm just not knowledgeable enough and don't have the tools needed to do this.

What can I give him to get him to avoid this stock?  Thanks!

**Edit:**  Thanks everyone for the insight on this stock.  I knew it was bad, but now I was able to explain exactly how bad it is and why.  I managed to convince him to stay with the blended portfolio approach that I set them on a few years ago.  

As for their relationship, it's actually really good.  He's not a reckless gambler but really just a big dumb goof that gets really easily convinced that something 'too good to be true' really can be true.  (Don't get me started on all the links he sends me about 200mpg cars that run on water or air or whatever pseudoscience and I have to explain to why it's not true and etc.)  My sister ensures me that she will always have the final say on any big purchases or investments.

In 1906, the great statistician Francis Galton observed a competition to guess the weight of an ox at a country fair. Eight hundred people entered. Galton, being the kind of man he was, ran statistical tests on the numbers. He discovered that the average guess (1,197lb) was extremely close to the actual weight (1,198lb) of the ox. This story was told by James Surowiecki, in his entertaining book The Wisdom of Crowds.

Not many people know the events that followed. A few years later, the scales seemed to become less and less reliable. Repairs were expensive; but the fair organiser had a brilliant idea. Since attendees were so good at guessing the weight of an ox, it was unnecessary to repair the scales. The organiser would simply ask everyone to guess the weight, and take the average of their estimates.

A new problem emerged, however. Once weight-guessing competitions became the rage, some participants tried to cheat. They even sought privileged information from the farmer who had bred the ox. It was feared that if some people had an edge, others would be reluctant to enter the weight-guessing competition. With only a few entrants, you could not rely on the wisdom of the crowd. The process of weight discovery would be damaged.

Strict regulatory rules were introduced. The farmer was asked to prepare three monthly bulletins on the development of his ox. These bulletins were posted on the door of the market for everyone to read. If the farmer gave his friends any other information about the beast, that was also to be posted on the market door. Anyone who entered the competition with knowledge concerning the ox that was not available to the world at large would be expelled from the market. In this way, the integrity of the weight-guessing process would be maintained.

Professional analysts scrutinised the contents of these regulatory announcements and advised their clients on their implications. They wined and dined farmers; once the farmers were required to be careful about the information they disclosed, however, these lunches became less fruitful.

Some brighter analysts realised that understanding the nutrition and health of the ox was not that useful anyway. What mattered were the guesses of the bystanders. Since the beast was no longer being weighed, the key to success lay not in correctly assessing its weight, but rather in correctly assessing what other people would guess. Or what others would guess others would guess. And so on.

Some, such as old Farmer Buffett, claimed that the results of this process were more and more divorced from the realities of ox-rearing. He was ignored, however. True, Farmer Buffett’s beasts did appear healthy and well fed, and his finances were ever more prosperous: but, it was agreed, he was a simple countryman who did not really understand how markets work.

International bodies were established to define the rules for assessing the weight of the ox. There were two competing standards – generally accepted ox-weighing principles and international ox-weighing standards. However, both agreed on one fundamental principle, which followed from the need to eliminate the role of subjective assessment by any individual. The weight of the ox was officially defined as the average of everyone’s guesses.

One difficulty was that sometimes there were few, or even no, guesses of the oxen’s weight. But that problem was soon overcome. Mathematicians from the University of Chicago developed models from which it was possible to estimate what, if there had actually been many guesses as to the weight of the animal, the average of these guesses would have been. No knowledge of animal husbandry was required, only a powerful computer.

By this time, there was a large industry of professional weight guessers, organisers of weight- guessing competitions and advisers helping people to refine their guesses. Some people suggested that it might be cheaper to repair the scales, but they were derided: why go back to relying on the judgement of a single auctioneer when you could benefit from the aggregated wisdom of so many clever people?

I started with $4,000 and got it up to $60,000 since January of last year. Here's the gist of my biggest gains:

Northern Graphite - I invested in this at about $.75/share and ended up selling in May at like $1.80/share.

Focus Metals - Along with Northern Graphite, I invested into this company during the graphite bubble, and sold in May as well. About $.70/share to $1.20/share.

After selling out of both Northern Graphite and Focus Metals near the end of a bubble, I bought into:

Zenyatta Ventures - a canadian graphite mining company, because I thought the bubble would continue to grow. I bought into Zenyatta at .$30/share. Today it trades at around $2.10/share.

Acadia Pharmaceuticals - I bought into this company after researching parkinson's, a disease my grandfather is dying from. I saw they were in phase II drug trials so I invested into the company at around $1.60/share. Today it trades at $14.19/share.

----------

I still own ZEN.V and ACAD, at a combined value of around $50,000, and have $10,000 in a mutual fund, WFPNX (Which has performed great since I bought in July!). I don't want to talk about how stupid my investing strategy is, trust me I know. This really just started as a game with my friend (I'm winning.)

1376266229.0,158,self.investing,1k6a2e,COUNTER RANT: The politically correct explanation of why nobody can/will pick a stock for your pile of cash on r/investing,190,32,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1k6a2e/counter_rant_the_politically_correct_explanation/,"So, some of you may have seen a post [http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1k63zz/rant_20_year_olds_with_no_experience_in_markets/].  It's a bit un-PC and cranky, but truthfully, s/he's kind of right.  Here's the gentler version of it (as I see it - opinion only, sole responsibility of the author, etc etc etc).

First, optional background:

Truthfully, stock picking is hard.  Really hard.  The market is smart, responds insanely quickly to new information, and the fact is, if you've had that thought, there's a pretty solid chance someone on the Street has already thought it.

Here's the straight truth: in finance, knowledge is power.  The faster/earlier you know something and can trade on it, the more profit you'll eventually make (assuming you get the call right, of course).  This is why insider trading is so damaging to markets - someone is incentivized to cheat, makes money, then everyone is.  Fair markets are efficient markets and vice versa.

Unfortunately, as a retail investor you also tend to hear about things the latest.  If you're reading about it in the paper, you're likely the last to know (or, at least, later in the informational food chain). 

If you don't work in the industry full-time, it's difficult to get access to these data, particularly if you lack industry contacts, industry knowledge, and access to sell-side research/other research.  This is important not just to get all the relevant data to make your investment decision, but also, you lack a good gauge of what the market and the consensus view is.  Bloomberg terminals are good for this (and stupidly expensive), and even they are highly ineffective at getting the real ""whisper"" number.



Second: Here's the scoop. Nobody responsible is going to give you a stock pick because it is a terrible and irresponsible move, both because this is r/investing (and not, say, r/daytrading or from u/charlesponzi#1fanlolz), but more generally because it's a terrible habit to get into and is bad for you overall.

Finance is about risk and reward.  It's about managing risk, and, in return, managing that reward.  It's about buying or selling uncertainty and constructing a portfolio of assets and a time series of expected cash flows that meets your specific needs and wants.  This is not to say that betting it all on equity XYZ is wrong, it may be perfect given your time horizon and risk appetite.  But the point is that finance is a complicated business.  

Sure, you may pick a great stock now.  And again.  And even again.  You could be the best, and I mean the best.  But the point of finance is about managing risk.  It's about learning how, and, more importantly, why one should manage risk and really understand the subtle implications of a portfolio decision. 

In closing, don't overreach.  Don't blindly ask for the quick fix.  Ask thoughtful questions.  Do your homework.  Learn and read as much as you can.  Challenge conventional wisdom, challenge your own beliefs and always, always, ALWAYS, challenge your decisions.  Use r/investing as a tool, as a resource, but not as your source of quick cash.

All that said, I've got some snake oil in the back of my van if you'd like to buy some. (Always end on a joke)


Edit: Let's not get hung up on the nitty gritty of market efficiency.  All I was trying to say is that it's really difficult to consistently beat the market, particularly if you don't have access to professional level information and resources, and one should focus on learning and building a portfolio.",,False,,t5_2qhhq,1376308350.0,,,True,t3_1k6a2e,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1k6a2e/counter_rant_the_politically_correct_explanation/,

[Update #2]",180,23,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pxo13/i_read_how_to_turn_50k_into_500_passive_income/,"Well hello there. It's been a month and here's the update. [Read the first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oibje/i_read_how_to_turn_50k_into_500_passive_income/)

Here's what I did last month. I bought the following stock:

* 500 x MSFT @ $28.20 (paid about $14,000)
* 500 x INTC @ $25.20 (paid about $12,500)
* 100 x MCD @ $100 (paid about $10,000)
* 200 x KO @ $66.80 (paid about $13,400)

I wrote February calls:

* MSFT: 500 x $0.86 = $430 (strike price $28 (in the money))
* INTC: 500 x $0.79 = $395 (strike price $25 (in the money))
* MCD: 100 x $2.30 = $230 (strike price $100 (at the money))
* KO: 200 x $0.90 = $180 (strike price $67.50 (out of the money))

Pocketed about $1100.

----------

So what happened during this month?

MSFT went up to $31.26, and got called away.

INTC went up to $27.37, and got called away.

MCD stayed at $100, and didn't get called away.

KO went up to $69.05, and got called away.

Paid 3*$20 in fees for stock being called away.

MSFT cost me $100 (got called away at $28, while I bought it at $28.20)

INTC cost me $100 (got called away at $25, while I bought it at $25.20)

KO made me $140 (got called away at $67.50, while I bought it at $66.80)

Total month #1: $1100 - $100 - $100 + $140 - $60 = $980.

----------

This month I'm just gonna play MCD as I don't want to buy any other stock. As soon as the market opens today, I'll get another 400 shares of MCD and write 5 contracts @ $1.10. That's $550, minus fees $25 = $525. Plus 3/15/12 is the dividend day, which should give me another $350.

Expecting to make $875 this month or so.

-----------

I got 400 shares of MCD at $100.07 at $40,028. Commission was $10. I wrote 5 contracts at $1.13 making $565, and the fee was $17.50.

Article:

THQ is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The beleaguered company has seen tough times over the years, with uDraw being a large part for many of the company's woes. In a prepared statement, the company says that its operations, including the ongoing development of its games, will be unaffected as the publisher has secured interim financing. Some noteworthy titles on THQ's slate include the upcoming South Park RPG, Metro: Last Light, Company of Heroes 2, Homefront 2, and the next Saints Row title.



""All of the company's studios remain open, and all development teams continue. The company remains confident in its existing pipeline of games. THQ maintains relationships with some of the top independent development studios around the globe,"" the press release stated.

Affiliates of Clearlake Capital Group LIP will acquire assets of THQ's business. Providing the court approves of THQ's ""first-day motions,"" the company expects Clearlake to assume any contracts with aforementioned third-party studios.

THQ recently ran a controversial Humble Bundle, which raised many millions of dollars. However, it's clear that the cash raised from the sale could not delay today's announcement.

""The sale and filing are necessary next steps to complete THQ's transformation and position the company for the future, as we remain confident in our existing pipeline of games, the strength of our studios and THQ's deep bench of talent,"" THQ CEO Brian Farrell said. ""We are grateful to our outstanding team of employees, partners and suppliers who have worked with us through this transition. We are pleased to have attracted a strong financial partner for our business, and we hope to complete the sale swiftly to make the process as seamless as possible.""

Jason Rubin, who joined THQ as their president in May, also commented: ""We have incredible, creative talent here at THQ. We look forward to partnering with experienced investors for a new start as we will continue to use our intellectual property assets to develop high-quality core games, create new franchise titles, and drive demand through both traditional and digital channels.""

So you have finally taken the plunge and are looking to buy a new house.  First off, congratulations.  If you are in my demographic (18-30), you are a statistical anomaly, but I digress.

A little about myself.  I am a real estate investor located in Southern California.  I buy both properties to flip, as well as rental properties for myself and my clients.  I first came into the field in 2008.  As an assistant to a rather large CEO of a mortgage company that shall remain nameless for various reasons.  His “hobby” was to buy houses at auctions, of which he decided I was best suited to learn.  I helped purchase properties up until the 2009 crash, when most of us mortgage workers got laid off.  

I started my own company shortly afterward, managing REOs for various financial institutions.  Business was good, and we soon became Bank of America's largest foreclosure contractor, managing up to 17 states and territories including the hardest hit areas of America (CA, FL, NV, IL, AZ).  Ive changed more locks and performed more evictions than anyone in the US up til that point.  I sold my company in 2010 to get back into the property investment industry.

My current company runs back end work for investors who wish to buy houses at auction, but do not have the time or the knowledge to put into purchasing.  If you are interested, contact me later.  All investors have to do is cash their dividend checks when the properties sell.  Its this secretive process that people pay so much money to learn.  Whether its through books or infomercials, you'll never really get the whole picture.  Even with my explanations below, my knowledge is limited to only Californian auctions and laws pertaining to the state.  It is also a summary, and shouldnt be taken as a bible).  In general, I suggest caution.  Auctions are not for the faint of heart.  Im giving this advice for free because someone gave me a shot once, and if you can do better than me, best of luck to you.

First off, a list of things you will need to succeed.

-Time.  I cant stress this enough.  Whether you are buying the house to live in, or to invest, auctions are a full-time job.  We've been know to work 60-80 hours a week just to buy a couple houses a month.

-Money.  Cashiers checks made out to yourself for the full amount of the winning bid.  There is no 3% down at auctions.  Its full price, or nothing.  Do not show up at an auction without said cash.  Preferably break it up into 25, 10, 5 and 1 thousand dollar amounts for which I will explain later.

-Access to the MLS (multiple listing service) or equivalent.  Current houses for sale in the area in question, as well as properties sold within the last year.  

-Access to a local realtor who knows the trends in your investment area.  Preferably someone with some knowledge of foreclosures.

-Access to a contractor, or someone knowledgeable of construction issues with residential houses. 

-A competent title rep, or self-knowledge of title paperwork.  Knowledge of the foreclosure processes and laws in your state are a must.

-Someone in the field running to properties that are up for auction, as well as comparable properties.  A digital camera for said properties as well.  Auctions are hectic, and sometimes minutes count at the courthouse steps. 

-Access to foreclosure notice lists.  (ie, sites like countyrecordsresearch.com)

-Balls.  If you were anything like me, you will be spending a significant portion of your net worth on your first purchase.  You will also be competing against seasoned bidders most likely. Good luck.

The first step is using the foreclosure list services.  I use www.countyrecordsresearch.com for my properties, but there are many others.  Basically, I get a daily email of foreclosure notices, their address, and a basic idea of what notes are going to auction.  Keep in mind, at auction, you are buying the note on a house, not the house itself.  I warn you though, the chain of title and amount of money owed on these lists are a general estimation. One should never use services like this one to purchase properties alone.

Once you have the list, you have to weed through the garbage.  Namely, houses that are underwater in their mortgages.  The opening bids will often exceed the value of the house, so you may discard them (most times, which I'll explain later) immediately.  This is also where access to the MLS helps.  You have to run “comps” or comparable properties.  Never trust zillow.com to run the value of the house.  They are usually way off the mark in terms of value.

Out of say a list of 100, you will quickly narrow it down to a dozen or so properties.  Namely, the houses that are going to auction that are below the estimated house value and in range of your investment parameters.  Most houses are underwater, hence the auction.  Once you have done this, then the real work begins.

Most times the notice of foreclosure will come a week or so ahead of time, so you do have a little bit to do your work.  If for some reason it comes later, and you dont have time to do proper research, pass on the property.  Its not worth the time and effort.  Keep in mind that serious investors wait weeks or months passing on properties that dont meet their exact requirements.  You shouldnt be eager to jump the gun.  Given the economy, your meal ticket will eventually arrive.

1363013098.0,144,self.investing,1a30po,Secrets of the world's greatest hedge fund,163,19,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1a30po/secrets_of_the_worlds_greatest_hedge_fund/,"If anyone follows the hedge fund space, you've probably heard about Bridgewater Associates.  The firm has over 1000 employees and manages some $130+ billion in assets. Since inception, their main fund has returned around 14% per year with only one year of losses -- a remarkably stable track record that has made Ray Dalio, Bridgewater's founder turned chairman, into [somewhat of a legend](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/07/25/110725fa_fact_cassidy). 

I'm interested in their 'All-Weather' strategy, which has been detailed by a number of bloggers and financial journals over the years. It relies on a static mix of assets that is periodically re-balanced -- a [brief video &amp; synopsis can be found here](http://www.bwater.com/home/research--press/the-all-weather-strategy.aspx). This apparently low turn-over strategy should be quite attractive to any investor sensitive about the [perils of active asset management](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21568741-hedge-funds-have-had-another-lousy-year-cap-disappointing-decade-going). Bridgewater's video shows the four [rising/falling growth/inflation environments and the assets expected to perform well in each environment](http://i.imgur.com/ptvBxYB.jpg). These ideas have been put to the test dozens of times, and it seems that [2012 was no exception](http://i.imgur.com/U2gofNk.jpg).

What has perplexed me over the years is how this mix of assets manages to beat the market so consistently. One problem I've had with the usual ideas behind MPT is that one asset usually returns less, meaning that even if its inclusion in a portfolio reduces volatility, it reduces returns too! For instance,* investment-grade bonds usually negatively correlated with equities, but they also tend to yield less. Dalio's ""risk-parity"" model helps to deal with that by using leverage to increase the returns of low-yielding assets. In his view, increasing an asset's volatility as long as it is *negatively* correlated to other assets in the portfolio, reducing overall volatility. His insistence that he uses 8-10 uncorrelated asset streams raises the question: what sort of assets is he looking at?! [There are some clues](http://i.imgur.com/7dQtOl8.jpg), but the rest of us must do the heavy lifting. Generally, it seems like there's a mix of equities, nominal bonds, inflation-linked bonds, commodities, emerging market spreads, developed corporate spreads, and possible some currency holdings.

Dalio seems to have constructed multi-factor beta regressions with linear residuals (errors) in order to model asset returns.  Just like he said in the video, he uses inflation, growth, and some sort of cash return as his drivers of asset prices. Now the question: what does he use for inputs? GDP is calculated quarterly and inflation annually, but these graphs ( [1](http://i.imgur.com/0HdF1bM.jpg) &amp; [2](http://i.imgur.com/wvzXAdv.jpg) ) show much more frequent input.  How is this possible?  Does anyone have any ideas for how these models would be constructed?

If one were to melt down all the gold and form it into a large cube, said Buffett, it would only be about 68 feet on each side — small enough, observes Buffett, to be nestled in the infield of a baseball stadium.

And yet, the monetary value of that gold would be about 10 trillion dollars. But what would be it’s actual value? That cube will produce nothing for the next century, said Buffett, nor even the next millennium. It will not pay interest or dividends, and it will not respond if you try to “fondle it.”

With $10 trillion, one could purchase the entire American cropland or Exxon-Mobil (NYSE:XOM) sixteen times over and still have about $1 trillion left over for “walking-around money,” said Buffett.
Those investments would yield trillions of dollars in new dividends, and after 100 years could be sold for far, far more than the cost of their purchase.

Crops and energy will always be viable because they satisfy a need, said Buffett. Conversely, the cube of gold will only be as valuable as what people will be willing to pay for it.

&gt;The dismal truth is that over the long run, the average person is a woeful investor, regularly losing money to more skillful traders. Dalbar performs an annual survey of actual investor returns in mutual funds, and compares them to the return of the overall market. He shared the latest, still unpublished figures with me. They tell a sorry story.

&gt;Over the last 20 years through December, the average return of all investors in United States stock mutual funds was 4.25 percent, annualized. Over the same period, the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index returned an annualized 8.21 percent. That’s a huge gap — nearly four percentage points a year over two decades.

&gt;I ran the numbers. A $10,000 investment at 4.25 percent would be worth $22,989 in 20 years. An investment in the S.&amp; P. 500, at 8.21 percent, would be worth $48,456. The difference is a sobering $25,467.

Let's have some fun!",201,69,186,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/umgs2/hi_reddit_i_have_10000_usd_and_a_stock_trading/,"Hi Reddit,

I know this probably sounds like a scam (I know that's the first thing I would think of), but for those of you who will believe me:

I have a stock trading account at my bank (CIBC - Canada) which allows me 1000 share trades for only $6.95. I also have received $10,000 USD from selling my 2012 (edit: typo, meant 2011) Honda Civic (no longer need a car for personal reasons).

Anyhow, long story short -- I know nothing about stocks, I have $10,000, and I'd like to (edit: trade) invest it in 1-3 stocks, hold for a x months, sell and give any profit to a charity which we choose. 

Obviously I'll be bummed out if I end up losing all the $10,000 but I figure reddit is smart enough to at least break even, so I'm kind of taking a gamble and hoping I'll come out of this with my $10,000 at least. 

Otherwise, I will absorb the potential losses and call this experiment a failure (lol). 

Charities I have in mind:
CCS - Canadian Cancer Society
CP   - Child's Play
HS   - Heart and Stroke Foundation

Thoughts? Is this is terribad idea? IF so, scrap it all to hell!

Cheers!

**edit #1** Regarding the whole tax thing someone brought up, great point, but I forgot to mention that this is a TFSA trading account. Tax-Free-Savings-Account is a Canadian thing, all gains (I was told) would be tax free. So I have 10k in this account right now, and whatever potential profit I would be able to move to my chequing account and then donate it to our charity. 

**edit #2** The first thing we need to decide is if we're going to choose 1 stock and ""go all in"" and wait, then sell... or to go with multiple stocks? I personally feel if we go with 1 stock ""all in"" it'll be simpler to keep track of and manage. Assuming this (unless it's a really bad idea), what stock from this list should I put the 10k in?

A lot of us answered, including me.  I use James O'Shaughnessy's ""Trending Value"" method.  I described the method in my reply:

&gt;I download all financial information on every company available (wrote a program do this for me). Then I can value whatever metrics in whatever way I want. I look at six statistics to form a stock's value for part 1 of my filter. Each gets a ranking of 0-100 with 100 being the ""best"" in the stock universe and 0 being the ""worst"" in the stock universe. Those 6 are:

    P/E
    P/S
    P/B
    P/FCF
    Shareholder Yield (which is Stock Buybacks + Dividend Yield)
    EV/EBITDA

&gt;A ""perfect"" stock has a 600 rating. Any stock above a 450 or so is a very financially sound, well rounded company, and generally undervalued (as referenced by the P/E, P/S, P/B) so I know my money isn't being thrown into a travesty waiting to collapse.
&gt;
I then look at the top 10% of those stocks (usually rated 490+) and sort them by 6-month relative price. This gives me an ordered list of financially sound and stable companies that the market is behind. A company can be financially stable without having growth, so this allows me to find out what's moving in the right direction.

I got a bunch of people asking questions both in the thread as well as by PM.  So, being friday, I decided that I'd run the program and let you guys ask to see the results of your stock(s).

I'll also post the results of the screen - the top 25 stocks returned by my program - with full breakouts.",,False,,t5_2qhhq,False,,,True,t3_1eyx3r,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1eyx3r/how_do_you_select_stocks_contd_trending_value_see/,

Its called the Investing Academy, and you can check it out at http://theinvestingacademy.com. (See the about page for more info).

Its really user friendly and the design is what I spent the most time on, making it simple and easy for students. It is probably too simple for many of you (only has buy/sell options now and NYSE/NASDAQ securities), but were working actively to add new features without compromising simplicity or usability.

Students can also create groups and invest with friends or start clubs in their schools, and the iOS app we launched only two weeks ago makes it easier than ever.

I'd love to get the feedback of this amazing community on how we can improve and make it more advanced for students or for any of you that have kids that are interested in learning.

There are no ads or gimmicks, were able to run it cheaply through Hostgator and are really focused on building a great tool, so any feedback would be very much appreciated.

It all started when I read [this post by CarlSagan79](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oe86p/heres_how_to_make_500month_in_passive_income_on/).

Last month I wrote 5 MCD May $100 calls and collected $72.5 premium. The calls expired worthless on Saturday and I kept the premium.

Totals by month so far:

* Month 1: $980

* Month 2: $897.5

* Month 3: $322.5

* Month 4: $72.5

Grand total: $2272.5. ($568 per month on average).

This month (May - June), I'm expecting to collect a $0.70/share dividend, which is $350, plus I wrote the calls yesterday. The price for $100 June calls was just $0.05, and the fee for writing 5 contracts was $17.50. So I'll be collecting just $7.5 from the calls this month.

I'm expecting to make $357.5 total from my 500 MCD shares this month (dividend + calls).

The rout says a lot about consumer confidence in the worldwide recovery. The sharply reduced rates of inflation combined with resurgence of other, more economically productive investments, such as stocks, real estate, and bank savings have combined to eliminate gold's allure.

Although the American economy has reduced its rapid rate of recovery, it is still on a firm expansionary course. The fear that dominated two years ago has largely vanished, replaced by a recovery that has turned the gold speculators' dreams into a nightmare.

1359907776.0,116,self.investing,17t6sp,"Valuation of biotech stocks, an overview.",139,23,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17t6sp/valuation_of_biotech_stocks_an_overview/,"I have seen alot of discussion on here about pre-revenue biotechs so I thought I'd describe the basic valuation technique used by professional investors and IBs. The technique is a risk adjusted NPV model. 

Firstly it is important to state that all of the companies value is in the future revenues of each drug they have in development, should that drug make it to market. This means that each drug can be valued individually and then summed together to create the companies valuation. 

If you are new to this space then I suggest you familiarise yourself with the clinical trials process - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research

To determine a drug's value you must know four initial points;

1) Launch date

2) Estimated peak sales

3) Probability of making it to market

4) Partnership and royalty rate

From these points the risk adjusted value can be determined.

-----------

**Launch Date**

This is the easiest to estimate as the average duration for each phase is known. Roughly these are; 

Discovery - 3 years

Pre-clinical - 1 year

Phase I - 1/1.5 years

Phase II - 1.5/2.5 years

Phase III - 2/4 years

Filing - 0.75 years

These are rough of course. In particular orphan drugs tend to progress faster as they can combine clinical phases. 

------

**Peak Sales**

This is the hardest to do and is seen as a dark art. Three main ways of estimating this; broker notes, comparable drugs and calculation from market research.

A good place to start is reading broker notes as in there they will have estimates for peak sales. Look at several as estimates can vary wildly. They may also have some sector research which will come in useful in a minute. 

Secondly have a look at rival drugs, either marketed or in development. Identify drugs with similar mechanisms of action and means of administration. Are orally administered drugs dominant and every intravenously administered drug has flopped? Does the drug being valued have a mechanism of action that has previously proved successful? Those already marketed can be used to determine the size of the potential market. Comparable drugs in development can lead you to more broker notes that may give you more insight into the market and an idea of what the competitors will be by launch year.

The third way is from market research. This is done by calculating the number of potential patients, expected market share, expected sales price and thus expected sales volumes. 

The three methods are best done together giving a range of values which can be critiqued and averaged if necessary. 

Peak sales are not reached in the first year after launch. Companies will launch in a limited number of countries and then slowly expand as they develop and grow their sales force. Peak sales are generally reached 4-6 years after launch. 

---------

**Probability of Making it to Market**

This introduces the risk adjusted aspect to the valuation. With a drug in a given phase there is a certain probability that it will progress. Combining these probabilities gives the chance of a drug making it all the way to launch. These probabilities (for the drug to go from Phase X to market) are approximately;

Pre-clinical - Negligible

Phase I - 10%

Phase II - 30%

Phase III - 70%

Filing - 90%

-------------

**Partnership and Royalty Rate**

Is the drug partnered and if so in which stage was it partnered? Small biotechs partner their drugs with a large pharmaceutical company to avoid having to pay the huge sums of money required to take the drug to market. In return the large pharma will pay the small biotech a royalty rate and some milestone payments. 

The royalty rate will most likely be in the range 0-25%. The exact figure depends alot on the stage the drug was in when it was partnered. The earlier the stage then the lower the rate as the large pharma is now taking on the risk. Phase I usually is around low teens, Phase II high teens and Phase III is usually low 20s. 

Milestone payments are given to the small biotech when the drug progresses a stage. Read the press release announcing the licensing as in there they might state the amount of each milestone or at the very least the total amount. From there you can assume the later milestones lead to a larger percentage of the overall milestone pot.

Finally have a look as to where there partnership covers. Is it world-wide or just one region or country? If it covers just one region or country then you have to treat the drug like two drugs, one with a launch date, peak sales and probability for the partnered region and one without.

-------

Once you have these four figures together you can build the valuation model. To do this you have to calculate the present value of the future sales, then factor in the royalty and then adjust for probability.

Use the launch date and peak sales to build an NPV model (there are thousands of examples online as well as excel functions you can use so I won't go into that). Be sure to discount back to today rather than the launch year. For years 1-peak year you have to slowly ramp up the sales. Then you assume the sales plateau for a while before decaying as rivals overtake and patents expire. Eventually about 15-20 years out they will be zero. 

If the drug is partnered then calculate the percentage paid to the small biotech. This is simply done and should lead to a single figure which is the present value of the small biotech's share of the future sales.

Finally multiply this final figure by the probability of the drug reaching market. This gives the risk adjusted value for the drug in question. Repeat for all drugs and sum to give the value of the company. 

-----------

**Discussion**

Why do we adjust for risk? When dealing with a single drug this seems pointless however when you are building up a portfolio as an investor you can buy into a range of drugs with favourable odds. If you have a drug with an estimated value of $100m and in phase I then it has a risk adjusted value of $10m. If you were to be offered this drug for $5m then it can be seen as a good investment. Buying 10 drugs with these figures should lead to 1 reaching market leading to a 100% return on investment. Conversely if you were offered these drugs for $20m then when one reaches market you have lost 50%. 

How do public companies trade relating to these valuations? Companies tend to trade at a discount to their NPV as there are uncertainties that aren't factored into the model described above. These are events such as poor management, lawsuits, delays etc. 

Why are there sudden jumps in valuation when phase results are announced? This is due to the probability factor. Take the example drug described in the paragraph above, if this drug progresses from Phase I to Phase II then the risk adjusted value changes overnight from $10m to $30m. This means that investors suddenly pile in until it reaches a new value. Similarly if the drug fails the progress then the value falls overnight. Companies with fewer drugs will experience much larger binary events that those with a broad portfolio. 

-------

This ended up waaay longer than I had planned when I started writing but hopefully it'll help some people. Biotechs are widely seen as some of the most risky stocks so be very careful when investing. Companies will happily proclaim about their cure for cancer etc but until they have actually made it to market then there is no guarantee. 

Any questions just ask.

Now, though, it's given up on that that battle and instead looks set to launch a same-day delivery service—and that could destroy local retail as we know it.

Farhad Manjoo has put together a wonderfully insightful essay over at Slate which explores the impact Amazon's new strategy will have. To give some perspective, Amazon's decision to accept sales tax as inevitable means it can change its play. To avoid sales tax in the past, it had a handful of large distribution centers. Now it's set to charge sales tax, it can legally set up smaller distribution centers in any state. In turn, that in theory means it'll be able to ship products inside of the same day. As Manjoo points out, that would be incredibly disruptive: It's hard to overstate how thoroughly this move will shake up the retail industry. Same-day delivery has long been the holy grail of Internet retailers, something that dozens of startups have tried and failed to accomplish. (Remember Kozmo.com?) But Amazon is investing billions to make next-day delivery standard, and same-day delivery an option for lots of customers. If it can pull that off, the company will permanently alter how we shop. To put it more bluntly: Physical retailers will be hosed.

Whether Amazon can pull it off, of course, remains to be seen—and to gauge for yourself you should read the Slate feature—but it seems likely. After all, as Manjoo points out, if it can ship items cross-country overnight, it sure as hell should be able to get them across-state inside a day. And at that point, you can kiss your local stores goodbye.""

It may very well not apply to you, so please feel free to disregard if that's the case. 


I hope that if I were in your shoes I would learn and invest prudently for the long term future, even if my family money looked more than adequate. I would invest conservatively for my family's long term future even if seemed absolutely silly when compared to other sources of family wealth. 


There is no such thing as a sure thing. If you think you've identified one, prepare to possibly have a rug pulled out from under your feet when you least expect it.


It only takes one lawsuit, divorce, investment gone awry or medical catastrophe to wipe out family wealth, no matter how deep the pool of money seems. What if you were written out of a will or a trust fund was depleted that you were counting on? What if Bernie Madoff 2.0 were to evaporate your family's legacy? Wouldn't you regret not having set aside and cultivated your own little reserve for you, your children and grandchildren?  


If I were in your shoes I hope that I would find a job or a cause that I could dedicate myself to. I personally think that there is immense merit in living a normal, hard working life, even if you don't have to. The virtues that allowed someone in your family to amass this wealth and leave you with a head start are still excellent virtues for you to learn and live by. 


I'd bet that those values are also the only virtues that will allow your family to maintain its comfortable position over a long enough time horizon. Just about every culture on our planet has a proverb about the phenomenon of third generation wealth loss; ""shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves"", etc. I believe that the consistent phenomenon can be traced back to an atrophied work ethic. It's difficult to have a strong work ethic when your bank account balance whispers in your ear that you don't have to work. This is a siren leading you to peril; put wax in your ears and tie yourself to the mast, lest you wind up on the rocks with a broken life. 


I hope that I would embrace the scarcity in my life as a gift, not a curse, and actively impose some austerity upon myself if the world did not impose it upon me. Struggle is good and necessary for growth. If you don't have any struggle in your life it may be very difficult to fully develop as a person. In my experience those who have unlimited time or money to do *anything* usually end up doing *nothing*. 


What if a young boy were kept permanently in a stroller to eliminate the strain of walking or the risk of falling? He would be hobbled. His legs would never develop, his muscles would wither and atrophy and the child would never know the joy of running or swimming his heart out. Don't allow your opportunity to hobble you. Sore muscles become stronger muscles. Short falls teach limits and balance. An easy life is a life without growth. 


If I were in your position I hope that I would know the value of sacrifice and hard work. How would one discover the true worth of something if he or she must never sacrifice to get it? How does one learn the true value of something when his resources are unlimited? I would never deprive someone of the pride and sense of accomplishment found in a hard-earned paycheck; it's one of the best feelings I've ever known. It is confirmation that you've worked hard, done well and served your fellow man in at least one aspect. At least *someone* felt that you were worth a paycheck that day, especially if they’re willing to let you come back the next day to earn another one. I believe that this is integral to the growth of the spirit; I am very close to several people who have never earned a paycheck in their lives, it has ruined them forever. 


You have an extremely unusual opportunity. You’ve won the ovarian lottery, as Warren Buffett puts it. You don't have to worry about many of the things that cause ordinary people daily worry and anguish. Embrace the gift. Be grateful and proud of what your family has accomplished, but always remember that there is merit and virtue in struggle; there is no innovation or growth without adversity. Impose upon yourself an extremely unusual level of self discipline and introspection. Make the world a better place. Try to make the world a little less tough for other people who must struggle for everything they have. Try your best to preserve and grow your family wealth and your own character. Ensure that your future generations have the same values and opportunity. Honor your family legacy.


Vince Lombardi said 

&gt;""I firmly believe that any man's finest hour, the greatest fulfillment of all that he holds dear, is that moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle - victorious."" 

Work your heart out at something, even if you don’t need to. It is one of the greatest gifts in this life.

So, herein I propose a primer for the following question -- and I hope in the comments people add to it.  Why?  So we can create the **Reddit Definitive Primer to Investing Your Money**:

**""What Should I Do To Get Started Investing My Money?""**

Here are my steps:

**1.  Determine What Your Goals Are.**

How old are you?  Are you fresh out of college and want to retire early?  With how much money?  Are you nearing retirement?  Are you middle aged with a family and almost nothing in your 401(k)?  Are you saving for a house, saving for college, saving for a vacation, all of the above?  Figure out *(a) what you want, (b) how much money you will need to get it, and (c) your time horizon.*

**2.  Get Your Finances In Order**

This means you have to do the following:

* Get out of debt.  Create a debt plan if you have debt.  Eliminate it.
* Have an emergency savings fund.  Typical advice is 3-6 months worth of expenses.  The point is that we all have emergencies, and you don't want an emergency to put you into debt.
*  Have a budget.  You need to know, and plan for, what each dollar you have is doing.

**3.  Max Out Your 401(k) If You Have One.**

If you work and can contribute to your 401(k), max out.  It's a no-brainer.

**4.  Invest In No-Load, Low-Fee Funds.**

For your 401(k) at least, you will want to invest in index funds.  Why?  They charge the lowest fees, and fees matter.  They are also more likely to have the best returns of the funds out there.

**5.  Diversify**

Don't invest just in stocks.  The rule of thumb is to invest your age in bonds.  But this is another reason to invest in index funds -- automatic diversification.  So 80% of your 401(k) might be in VTSMX, and 20% might be in VBMFX.

A good option is to split your stock index fund percentages into, for example, 70% total market index (for broad diversification), 15% small cap index, 15% international.  It's up to your risk tolerance, but do your research and watch the fees.

**6.  Expand Your Horizons**

If you do all of this, you'll have a lot of financial security over the long-term, saving for retirement and your long-term goals.  At this point, look into 

* Individual stocks
* Real Estate
* Derivatives (if you are adventurous and have cash to throw away -- this is speculation, not investment)

I welcome expansion of this guide.

I also welcome thoughts on how to make the /r/Investing thread more than just a ""How do I get started"" thread.  The information is out there, has been answered many, many times.

Because of the composition of my portfolio, I'm getting a lot of questions about whether I'm actually using an authentic value strategy. This is understandable because I didn't create this portfolio yesterday and call each one a value investment. Most of my investments have been held for *many* years and **none** of these companies are near the original price that I paid. The order and the percentage of each holding has shifted dramatically even in the past year, and some investments are now more appealing as growth than as value.

I think some people are working under the assumption that a value portfolio must only hold stocks that are currently extremely undervalued. If that were the case, it would be very difficult to ever see any decent returns.

So it's been another month. Last month I got lazy and put all eggs in one basket and got 500 MCD shares at $100. On March 8th the stock price fell to $97, so I'm now stuck with 500 MCD shares until it goes back to $100.

Last month I wrote 5 contracts at $1.13 making $565, and the fee was $17.50. Since the stock price fell, the options expired worthless and I collected $547.5.

I also bought them before ex-dividend date and got paid the dividend of $0.70 per share. That made me another $350.

Total earnings last month: $897.5

Since I'm now stuck with 500 shares of MCD, all I can do is write the same $100 calls for whatever they are going. So last Monday on 19th I wrote 5 contracts at $0.68.

That's $340 minus $17.50 fee = I'm expecting to make $322.5 this month.

Totals by month:

* Month 1: $980

1371180216.0,102,self.investing,1gbdmf,"By request: Why Bitcoin is a specific kind of scam called a seigniorage scheme (long, but has tl;dr). X-Post from /r/Finance.",348,246,579,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gbdmf/by_request_why_bitcoin_is_a_specific_kind_of_scam/,"Seigniorage has two functional definitions, although they really dovetail out of one. Within debt-backed fiat it's usually defined as the profit made from interest paid on the debt which backs the fiat. The persons with seigniorage privilege in debt-backed fiat would be the cartel of international banking elite to whom once-sovereign nations pay the interest to lease their non-sovereign ""sovereign"" currencies.

The strict definition of seigniorage, however, is 'the difference between the face value of something and the cost to produce and distribute it.' In the case of debt-backed fiat, the interest is rolled in as a functional increase in the value of the currency to the seignoirage privilege holders, since it's additional revenue generated from the same dollar despite no additional cost being required to produce the physical bill or digital dollar entry on a balance sheet. In the case of coinage, the inheritor of seigniorage is the United States treasury (say a quarter costs $.03 to produce and bring to market, and its face value is $.25. The inheritors of the seigniorage profit $.22 per quarter when they are initially spent into the market).

Bitcoin is a seigniorage scheme because the program was not widely known or public when the first bitcoins were generated. You can show me your fancy bs (and it's really just window dressing, making things appear fantastic so you will be distracted from the same rotten core that's at the center of all such scams) about 'mining' them and how it's 'free to all' and all of this, but the fact remains that whether they were 'mined' or not initially, at the beginning there was a very small group of people who knew of the existence of Bitcoin. An anonymous, shadowy cartel of insiders who pretends to be one fictitious person in order to maintain their anonymity.

Because Bitcoins are digital, the cost of generating them was negligible, as was their value. Their value was then pumped artificially using paid gophers and an enormous marketing campaign throughout internet circles, preying upon lonely techies with decent job security and convincing them it was a gateway to 'economic freedom.' This is textbook scam; it has a vulnerable, wealthy, lonely market audience with very little practical experience with economic models or systems, but plenty of money to take.

The creators of the initial currency and system are unknown, which means the inheritors of the seigniorage are totally anonymous and to this day no one knows who they are and what they've done with the massive amount of money they've earned when they sold their once-worthless but post-pump-valuable Bitcoins onto the market initially. This is textbook scam, it should be a huge red flag. The fairytale that this is the creation of one person, who obviously does not exist, is another red flag of a textbook scam. When Rome crashes and burns, these insiders simply slip away to their new island in Micronesia while you're dead in the water, and you have no way of even knowing who pantsed you.

Once the value of the commodity was inflated beyond its initial zero value, Bitcoins were then sold liberally to lonely suckers with zero scam experience, at which point the insider cartel could've just walked away and let it crash and burn. Instead, more scarily, it appears they have used part of that capital (and perhaps only sold part of their initial reserve) to exert influence within or over the exchanges themselves, and may control one or more entirely for all we know. The pump then continued. The exchanges are incredibly corrupt, there have been several crashes already and there is zero explanation for how the value of Bitcoins has recovered from any of them. The most likely answer, in my opinion, is that the seigniorage gains and revenues from insider-generated dumps and successive rebuys are being used to continue to pump the scam, as is typical in equity market pump and dumps as well. The insiders are always going to exit before everyone else, allowing them to rebuy on the cheap and pump again, and their control over one or more exchanges facilitates this.

**Then there's the total hogwash that Bitcoin is a 'currency.' There are several reasons why Bitcoin is not a currency, but rather a zero-purpose digital commodity.** This distinction is very important, because removing its distinction as a currency means its downfall is inevitable since as a digital commodity it has zero tangible purpose. Anything can be a medium of exchange for as long as you can trick one fool into valuing it, but that doesn't make it a currency. It makes it a pet rock, minus the rock and the paint if it's digital.

A key difference between a currency and a commodity is that currencies typically command a premium within poorer societies, and commodities need not. A great example is the Federal Reserve Note (most people mistakenly call it the United States Dollar), which is worth more and generates a great deal of attention if pulled out of a wallet in Zimbabwe. Try that with a Bitcoin, and after the initial curiosity surrounding its novelty you'll be left only with confusion as you utterly fail to explain to these people why this silly token has any value whatsoever.

If you can name one poor society that values Bitcoins more highly than first-world ones, you'll be well on your way to shattering my logic. But you won't be able to do that, because poor societies have zero use for Bitcoin; it is a commodity of privilege because its uses are fictitious, and the fact that it doesn't translate vertically down the income inequality ladder means it is completely screwed in its supposed-intended long-term purpose. This is in marked contrast with, say, silver, which is a true currency (as well as a commodity) in that it has ubiquitous global liquidity and can be exchanged for virtually any world currency within any society, with a linear increasing premium as income within the society of exchange falls.

Bitcoins also have very poor liquidity, in that they are incapable of purchasing most fundamental necessities of life, and certainly cannot do so on demand. The very few exceptions to this are niche cases hoping to benefit from the fad and nothing more. This also makes it dissimilar to currencies, which have peak liquidity.

Magic cards, for instance (interestingly, the thing MtGOX, short for Magic: the Gathering Online Exchange, was initially designed to trade, before they were prohibited from doing so), are an infinitely stronger currency than Bitcoins ever will be because they are incredibly liquid anywhere but indigenous communities (making them weaker than, say, silver or gold but little else), and command a great premium in less-affluent societies like Brazil. They're also a functional on-shore tax shelter, making them one of the most practically useful mediums of exchange in the entire world, and their market has experienced more sustained, successive growth than any in modern history to my knowledge, while remaining nearly crash free.

The most recent seigniorage scheme that Bitcoin resembles is cap-and-trade. Only cap-and-trade was a far more honest scam, in that at least the globalist billionaires like Al Gore were willing to admit they were the team who was going to inherit the seigniorage when companies were forced to purchase a totally worthless and created-from-zero-and-at-zero-cost commodity called 'carbon credits' at an artificially inflated value. When the carbon credit market crashed in Europe and the whole scheme reached seeing-is-believing level, the plan was abandoned (money already made, just like Bitcoin is poised to do/be). Bitcoin is even shadier; the sinister seigniorage schemers won't even admit who they are, and the only difference is that its market hasn't crashed yet. But it will. Guaranteed. Because they're totally worthless.

Don't be a bag holder.

**TL;DR:** A huge quantity of Bitcoins were created by people, at their leisure, when their value was zero and no one knew they existed, then their value was pumped by marketing to a target audience of well-paid, bored, gullible suckers and then they were sold to them at much-higher-than-zero value. The inheritors of the seigniorage are anonymous. Currencies have liquidity, and command a premium in less-affluent societies. Magic cards (intentionally trivial comparison) are a real currency in every single way Bitcoins are not, and will continue to function as a far better alternative currency than Bitcoins ever will, because they're also a functional on-shore tax shelter as well as having peak liquidity and being a way to convert any currency into any other currency without paying conversion fees.

**STL;DR:** Bitcoins are cap-and-trade 2.0, plus anonymity for the perps since they couldn't possibly get the legislative cover Gore et. al tried to obtain so they would be immune to prosecution for scamming everyone when the market inevitably crashed.

Virtual Stock Exchange game, can you out trade other Redditors? 

This is a continuation of last year's Reddit virtual stock exchange game played on Marketwatch last year.

I used to run this game with people from work, it was always a lot of fun. Here is how it works: This website (run through marketwatch.com) uses the real and active stock market to get its data, it then gives you a set amount of fake money to make trades. It delays the trades like the real market would, it lets you do short sales, set limits on buys and sales, do all kinds of real market tricks as if it was a real trade.

I'm setting up a new game for Reddit to play. The rules are simple. You get $100,000 to start off with.

The game will run 3 months, starting tomorrow 2/22/2013. It will end on 5/22/2013. 
Players can join at any time.

No stocks can be bought for less than $2. (this prevents someone from putting all $100,000 into penny stocks, then when they rise 1 cent selling and then not trading any more till the game ends. &gt;$2 makes the game more risky.)

All symbols and markets are open to be played. Each trade will cost a $10 commission.

Selling on the margin is disabled, you only have your $100,000 to play with.

Short selling is enabled.

You can not trade in partial shares (must purchase in full share increments). www.marketwatch.com/game/100k-virtual-stock-market-game

The more people play the more fun this is, if we get enough players I'll make us our own Subreddit.

I personally know very little about the stock market, I've never traded for real money, only this game. Everything I know I learned from playing this game, it is quite educational. It can be as complicated and time consuming as you want to make it, we used to have guys who would flat out day-trade the game, and others who made a few purchases and then let it ride for the whole game.

The game is now up and running, hope to see you there.

You will need to make an account to play, which is free, (obviously, how else would it track your profile).

This really should be a 200 level since it involves some numbers (although you won't yet need a calculator), but I'll just keep the numbering sequential for OCD sake.  On that note, I'm aiming this at people who read and understood the first two - which were brief but dense.  Also we're getting to the point where I can't generalize options as much, so note that this post (and probably the rest) is geared more towards trading options (as opposed to things like hedging, or using as synthetic instruments).  As usual corrections are welcome.


**Disclaimer:** I am writing this as an educational supplement.  My motivation for writing these has been explicitly to help fill the gap in more advanced conversations.  By no means am I encouraging anyone to trade with this information.  It's worth pointing out that in efforts to make these short and productive I've trimmed out the potentially ridiculous risk with options.  Perhaps I'll dedicate an entire post for that.



.



**EXCHANGE**

Quick note on this.  Unlike stocks which are listed in specific exchanges (like NASDAQ or NYSE), stock options are not bound to a particular exchange since they're essentially just bets.  It's worth knowing that the Chicago Board Options Exchange, or CBOE, is the biggest among them (there's like 9 or so 
other ones) and is home to the all popular VIX (more on this at a later date).  But to make things simple when picking an exchange, there's usually a ""[Best](http://i.imgur.com/rreWD.png)"" choice which figures it out for you.


.


**THE MARKET**

So, it's finally time to pick some options.  Well just like stocks, the first stop is to check out the prices.  But now we're going to pay special attention to the market as well, because although market conditions play a part in stocks, they play a crucial role with options.  Also, if you're speculating on a price move, the trick is to shop around for opportunities involving **various strategies** using options and/or stocks, because there are **many ways to bet**.  Many more than just up or down, that is.  

While looking at buying options, a good rule of thumb is to make sure there's healthy (a lot of) volume.  Having a **liquid market** will make sure that there's enough buyers and sellers to get in and back out of the position with relative ease.  It's entirely possible that you buy an option and then have nobody to sell it back to (at a half-way reasonable price) when the time is right.  

This also tends to tighten up the **bid/ask spread** (remember: bid is sell price, ask is buy price).  This is another big difference with options.  Typically when buying stocks, as long as they're somewhat popular, I don't even look at the spread - in fact most popular stock ""quoters"" won't even show them.  But you'll notice that options chains rarely have a single price and instead show you the bid/ask separately.  The reason for this is that with options, pennies matter.  And the spread will consume into your profits.  

Take a look at this [chain for LVS](http://i.imgur.com/P41JM.png) with March expiration.  You'll see that there are some options with 1 cent spread (green) and others with 15 cent spreads (red).  If you were to buy options from the red circle, you're instantly losing $15 dollars PER CONTRACT not to mention commissions.  I just checked some AAPL Jan '14 calls and some of them have like a $3 spread.  That's $300.00 per contract instantly evaporated!

The 2 factors I can think of that determine liquidity are **option popularity** (some stocks don't attract options traders) and **strike price / expiration date**.  Even popular stocks lose volume if you look to far ahead or if you pick strike prices that are far from ""the money.""  

Make that 3.  **Open Interest** (or OI or Op Int).  This is a metric that you'll typically see in options chains indicating the number of ""live contracts"" which are out on the market. High OI would imply that there's high volume. The reason why volume and OI are not necessarily the same, is because in practice you can write a contract (create a new one, and adding +1 to the OI tally) and later buy it back (subtracting -1 to OI tally).  If this scenario played out in an empty market, the volume would be 2 and OI would be 0.


.



**TIMING**

Timing is everything with options.  Remember that the moment you buy an option it starts losing extrinsic value from time decay, so this is important.  As noted by [facemelt](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pnray/optionstrading_103_the_premium/c3qx7jz) in the last post, time decay is not linear.  Meaning that stocks won't lose a set amount every day until expiration.  


[Here's a graph](http://i.imgur.com/71h3M.gif) showing what the time decay looks like as dictated by the [black-scholes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes) model.  You'll notice the drop in price due to **time decay exponentially increases at 30 days from expiration**.  This doesn't mean options with less than 30 days are no good, but if you buy them it should be part of your strategy (like say, a day trade).


Another important thing to consider is recent news with the underlying stock.  Big events can temporarily dislodge prices (which you can also use in your favor, if you want).  Announced **dividends** is a big one.  For various reasons, on an ex-dividend date, call prices will go down and put prices will go up.  Another big one is **earnings** releases.  You'll notice a huge buildup in premiums (due to implied volatility) as an earnings release approaches, and then a huge drop the day after.  This affects calls and puts alike.  


.


**EDIT: STRIKE PRICE**

*Credit to [CJP84](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/psxp0/optionstrading_104_mechanics_of_buying_options/c3s00hq) for bringing this up*


*Additional observation from [complaintdepartment](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/psxp0/optionstrading_104_mechanics_of_buying_options/c3s0y54) who points out that this point becomes gray area when the strike and underlying price are close*

Another important thing to remember is the dangers of buying options with no intrinsic value, because after all when the expiration day comes, that's all they're worth.  So buying an option with no intrinsic value (not ITM) has the potential to be worthless upon expiration.  

That said, they're not always bad, *depending on your strategy*.  For example, buying an OTM option is sort of like buying a house with a 100% interest mortgage (your monthly mortgage payments only go towards the interest but not towards the principal of the house).  Some people actually do this, because they believe the value of the house will go up, and they'll resell it for profit.


.


**LEVERAGE**

This is a very important concept which early options traders don't realize right away, and is the reason options can be so powerful and/or dangerous.

Options harness the power of leverage by relying on changes in price to derive their values, and *not necessarily* the price of the underlying.  For example, let's compare MCD and GRPN currently trading at $100 and $20 respectively.  If you look at their March expirations options, you'll see that the price for an at-the-money call (strike prices 100 and 20) is about $1.00 for each of them.  (And yes, I realize MCD is not quite 100 yet but if you factor out intrinsic and extrinsic values you'll end up about the same).

So for $100, you can buy a call which expires next month for either of these two companies, and you've exposed yourself to 100 shares of said company. 

Now ceteris paribus, if the price of *both* GRPN and MCD went up tomorrow by 5% the price of the MCD call would go up to around $3.50 while the price of GRPN's call would go up to around $1.50.  That's the difference between profiting $250 vs $50).  

And the reason for this is because if MCD went up by 5% it would be up $5 and if GRPN went up by 5% it would only be up by $1, and the premium only cares about **relative price movement**, and not necessarily about the underlying's value (this is a simplification).

This is also why expensive stocks like AAPL and GOOG are popular with options gamblers, because as you've already seen here they can have huge swings.  And this is also how a lot of people go broke.


*I realize I sped through this topic.  If it left you confused, ask and I'll either reply or modify the post.


.



**THE CHAIN**


And finally, the chain.  This is just to tie up some of these concepts and you can see what they look like in the real world.  At first it can be overwhelming when looking at options chains, but if you know what you're looking for they're not that bad.  I'm going to show you what it looks like in OptionsHouse, but most chains will be similar in nature and information.

[Open this chain in another tab](http://i.imgur.com/XL0B7.png)


* Purple circles - **calls** and related metrics (Bid price, Ask price, Volume and Open Interest)

* Blue circles - **puts** and related metrics (Bid price, Ask price, Volume and Open Interest)

* Green circles - **expiration date**

* Cyan circles - **strike prices**

* Yellow circles - options that are at or very **near the money**

The other numbers are for a later day.

Also, to highlight the risks involved, go back and look at the February expiration contracts still open under OI (both calls and puts) which are expiring worthless tomorrow.  If you go back and look at March's prices you'll pretty much get an idea of what those contracts were worth a month ago.  That's a lot of money lost.

I heard about lending club from one of my residents and was pretty interested in the possibility of making some decent returns off a very diversified portfolio. I started back in June 2012 and did the bare minimum to start out.($25) since then I have been putting in biweekly amounts from my income into the account and have been reinvesting interest and principle gained.

So far I have had no default's; but I do expect to see some within the next year or two. To combat against these loses though, having $25 or more ***interest*** from notes will negate the loss at one per month. I have since surpassed the $25 a month interest gain and really like how this has been playing out as of yet. I just wanted to share my thoughts and experience. (not very long but still something to share)

Included is a pic: http://imgur.com/w5R2kkO from my account dashboard showing my net return since June. I am very young (24) and have expendable income so I have been investing rather aggressively with higher risk notes. My theory is I will be making more interest with notes than with my losses if I continue putting money in the way that I am.

Hope this gave y'all a little idea about lending club if anyone had any interest in it.

Also please correct me if you spot a mistake, and if I'm blatantly wrong I'll edit the post with the correction.  Otherwise if it's more of a minor detail, I'll leave it as is and link to your comment instead so you can get credit.

**EDIT: I've revised the post significantly for expanding on some topics**
.


**INTRODUCTION**

Now we know more about how options can be monetized in ways other than exercising - the purchaser/owner of an options contract has the ability to sell it to someone else.  So now this raises the question... What is the value of the contract? Can that value change, and if so why?

To answer this question, I'll once again ask you change the way you look at options even further.  Rather than thinking of them as instruments that just you buy and then sell in an imaginary store, think of them as instruments that make you want to start your own store so you can sell them to others as well.  In other words, consider that sometimes **you** might benefit from writing an option, giving you the obligation to buy/sell, and giving someone else the option to buy/sell from you.  Looking at it that way makes it easier to question the price, since there's **two parties** which are (hopefully) rational and smart, and both agree on the price of the ""bet.""  Or if you like that analogy, think about it as a sports bet in which the odds even out the expected payout and both parties agree to it.


.


**PREMIUM**

Aahh, finally I can say this word.  The **premium** is the proper term that's frequently referred to as the fee, the price, the cost, etc...  Although none of the terms are necessarily wrong, but they all carry different implications which can be a source of confusion.

So how do we calculate the premium?  Well first there's no one person or organization* decides what premium should be.  Remember, the market decides the price and is set by the last people who made a trade. 

Lets examine the forces affecting the premium with some exercises:

Assumptions: Facebook (FB) has been public for three months and is currently selling for $50.  Today is 2/16/12 and February options expire tomorrow.

* If you bought and owned 1 call (for any amount) to buy FB with strike $48 that expires in Feb (tomorrow).  How much would you get if you exercise? $2.  And therefore what's the lowest price you would be willing to sell it at? Should be *at least* $2, right?  The *""at least $2""* part makes up the **intrinsic** value.  Now, using that logic, answer this question again if the strike price was $10, and again if the strike price was $50 (answer is $40 and $0, respectively).

* Now let's assume that tonight after the market closes, FB is going to release their quarterly earnings which will likely tank or skyrocket the price of FB, which means that you either lose $2 or make theoretically infinite (i.e. lose little or win a lot).  And it's an all-or-nothing bet because after tomorrow, the option expires and you have no time to let it recover any value.  How much would you sell it for now?  More than the first question or less? Not sure? To help answer this, let's now assume you don't own any options and instead you decide to write a call and sell it to someone.  Now you stand to make $2+ (see above), or you stand to lose theoretically infinite (i.e. win little or lose a lot).  How much would you charge for such a huge risk? Hopefully a lot given the expected return.  This is an **extrinsic** value added to the premium.  In this case, the uncertainty or **implied volatility** is driving up the premium.

* Lastly, this one's tricky, assuming you own and want to sell the call *OR* you feel like writing new one, how much would you expect to sell that option if it expired 1 year from now?  Also, because it's a year away, you don't care as much about earnings or other swings since you have an entire year to let the price recover.  (Hint: remember the game is no longer about letting options expire, it's about trading the contract for profit, and you have an entire year to wait for the perfect price).  Not sure? Well then answer this, would you sell it for more or less than in the first example? Answer should be more, because as time goes on so does the likelihood the price will fluctuate from $48 is high.  This **extrinsic** value is the **time** component.

.

**DERIVATIVE**

Ever wonder why sometimes they call options ""derivatives""? In calc, you learn that it means rate of change.  And does not care about the actual underlying value in a function, but is interested in how that position will change if the underlying input(s) move.  Should sound familiar... And this is also why there are options for $100 stocks going for the same or cheaper than options for $20 stocks.

So in short, we have 3 inputs that actively feed into the premium throughout the life of the contract:

*Edit: I had requests for talking about  greeks, so I'll include the name in parenthesis).  Also [facemelt](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pnray/optionstrading_103_the_premium/c3qx7jz) below goes into more detail on this.*

1. Underlying **price relative to strike price**, and intrinsic. *(delta - in greek)*
2. Uncertainty, or **implied volatility,** and extrinsic.  *(vega - in greek)*
3. **Time** until expiration, and extrinsic. *(theta - in greek)*

If any/all of these inputs increase, so does the option price.  But that also means, that **upon expiration extrinsic values (both time and volatility) will be 0**, and all we are left with is the intrinsic value / exercise value (which is 0 if you're not ITM). All 3 of these inputs move independently throughout the life of the contract affecting the price.  While 2 of the 3 inputs are relatively unpredictable, the one we can depend on is time.  The **moment you buy an option it starts losing value, and the longer you hold it the more it drops.**  So unless you're hedging, the game is to throw these options around like hot potato's while they rapidly fluctuate in price.  The risk can be contained if you know what you're doing, or it can be disastrous if you don't.  

Calculating the intrinsic value is easy, just figure out your profits if you chose to exercise right now, and there you have it.  But the problem is how to calculate the value of uncertainty, and time component, since they're somewhat subjective and impossible to measure/valuate.  And this has historically been a big problem. 

Well, about forty years ago, a couple of Good Will Hunting type guys pretty much figured it all out using [complex partial differential equations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_scholes) while trying to find ""the perfect hedge.""  One of them even got a Nobel Prize for it.

But that formula took off, and exploded the options market as we know it today.  It's been empirically tested to show impressive accuracy, and has led to an entire science behind options including using *""Greeks""* which are nothing more than a bunch of metrics.

In my mind, this is a significant reasons to remain positive about the US stock market.
Obviously a main reason for being investment averse has to do with the lack of jobs and disposable income to invest as well as general distrust of the markets. However, in 2, 5, or 10 years or whenever the economy improves and people find themselves with savings and earning only 0.1% interest in their savings account, I'd expect quite a rush back into the markets. And this huge increase in credit should provide a significant boost in the markets.

EDIT:
I found a better statistics from a gallup poll:
http://www.gallup.com/poll/147206/stock-market-investments-lowest-1999.aspx

This survey (probably more reliable) shows that the drop in American's invested in the market hasn't dropped as much as the NPR article states. The market dropped from a high of 67% in 2007 to 54% in 2011.

Amazon Locker allows you to have your packages sent to the equivalent of single-use P.O. boxes housed in 24-hour convenience stores, grocery stores and drug stores. Amazon sends you an email with a pickup code, which you enter on a touchscreen to open the door of the locker containing your package. You have three days from the delivery date to pick it up.

The lockers just arrived in 7-Elevens in the San Francisco Bay Area, and they’re already in place in Seattle, New York, Washington, D.C., and London. Clearly, they could be coming soon to a city near you, and Amazon’s brick-and-mortar competition should worry if they start to catch on.

With its rollout of same-day delivery, and now lockers, Amazon is steadily chipping away at reasons to walk into a store at all. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter tells Marketplace that companies like Best Buy struggle in vain to compete against Amazon because the cost of keeping a physical store open adds about 10 percent to prices. Pachter says the ability to walk out of the store with the item you bought on the same day you walked in is one of the few advantages traditional retailers still have.

If Amazon can deliver your order the same day you placed it, and they have their own physical location for customers to take the delivery, then they’ll have nearly succeeded in matching all the selling points of a regular store while avoiding the vast majority of the overhead that managing a piece of real estate requires (The Wall Street Journal reports that Amazon pays a small fee to the owners of the stores that have its lockers). The only thing Amazon won’t have is the showroom.""

1364387734.0,92,self.investing,1b3u9j,$250k windfall. I want to invest in (buy 100%) an established business and run it full time. 18 month timeframe. What would you do?,146,54,236,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b3u9j/250k_windfall_i_want_to_invest_in_buy_100_an/,"This might get long, sorry. Thanks in advance for reading all this, it's appricated.          

Background on the windfall. The company I work for was acquired by a larger company. I have founder's shares, and own 1.33% of the company which will net me around $250k after taxes. It will be 18 months until I have liquid access to the funds (long boring unimportant tax related story). Basically, I've won the ""wage slave lottery"".         

A short bit about me. I'm 30, married, we just had our first child this month. I own a home, owe ~$200k on the mortgage, which is just about what the house is worth. No other debt, or major assets for that mater. I earned ~$85k last year, however I was laid off due to the merger (I know right? Talk about a severance package...) but have lots of savings and I am currently taking time off to spend time with the newborn. I will be getting a job making $60k-$80k at some point in the near future. Not too concerend about the short term here, lets think long term.        

I've been seriously racking my brain on what I should do with the money. My goal is obviosuly to get the highest possible return with a level of risk I can tollerate. Not buying myself anything fancy. I want this money to do work for me.           

I could pay off my mortgage, but at current interest rates it's hardly the best use of the money. It would boost my monthly cashflow by $1000 if I didn't have a mortgage, and make life a lot easier. But I'd hardly get ""rich"" by living rent free.       

I know you guys are all about the markets, but building a diversified stock portfolio or putting it all into index funds isn't really my style. However you are more then welcome to convince me this is the way to go.     

I've considered *several* real-estate deals. Everything from flipping houses, buying up income generating rental units to getting a massive mortgage, buying an apartment building and being a slum lord. The property market here kinda sucks, at the top of a bubble and the best projections are that values will just keep up with inflation.    

My friends want me to start up a business. Because I'm good with comptuers they think I can be the next Facebook or something. It's not that easy. I tried the ""self employed comptuer guy"" route a decade ago and it was a total flop. As most of you know more than 50% of new small businesses fail within 5 years. Starting a new company is higher risk than I'm comfortable with. Might as well bet the money on black at the roulette table...   

I've considered franchises. I'm holding the disclosure statemet from the ""voted #1 franchise for 10 years"" guys in my hand right now. The numbers frankly *suck*. How would you like to spend $200k to open a restruant where you can work 70 hours a week for $60k a year in net profit? Oh, and they can take your franchise away with no renumeration if you don't meet their company standards 3 times during a random inspection. Sounds like a GREAT deal to me...    

Also with a franchise you are buying a known working business model, but not a known working *location* for that business model, which is really more than half the battle with a retail/restruant business.    

So I'm now leaning towards buying and running an already established company. My logic is that a company with an established business model, established customer base and established location, that has a verifiable net profit is a much safer investment. What's even better is that companies in this price range seem to be selling for ~1X their net revenue. So if I were to spend $200k on a business, keep $50k in reserve for operating expenses I would recouperate my initial investment in just over 1 year's time. The ROI here is just MASSIVE compared to other options I've considered. Even if I pay myself $80k per year I'm still basically doubling my money in 2 years. I think you would have to be willfully negligent to run a company that has been profitable, and in business for 5+ years into the ground before you got your money back out of it. Besides, I plan to increase the value of the business I buy, not destroy it.      

So I've set myself some ""rules"" for shopping for a company:  

1. Been in business more than 5 years    

2. Been profitable for at least 5 years    

3. Books that survive an audit, showing profit as advertised 

4. Access to the owner's tax returns for the length of time the business has been running    

5. Under $200k purchase price to leave me with a cushion to operate  

6. Net profit greater than or equal to 1x the cost of the business     

Now, I've already identified 2-3 business for sale that would meet this criteria in my local area. Obviously these will not be available after 18 months, but I am using them as a sort of ""case study"" on what will be available when I'm in a position to buy the business.    

One thing that I think I have going for me is rejecting the ""do what you love"" advice that people seem so quick to dish out. People open a bakery because they love to bake, or a book store because they love books and never stop to consider the *numbers* of their industry. I'd gladly run a toxic waste disposal facillty if the numbers were good enough. I want to make the most amount of money possible, so that I can retrire at 50 and then really start to ""do what I love"".     

Also I should mention that while I have a long standing love of business and economics, I have no formal training in either. I'd like to take a good business course, or at the very least read some excellent books over the next 18 months to prepare myself for this, so if you have any suggestions about learning to be a shrewed businessman I'm all ears. I'm currently reading The E-Myth Revisited.  

So there you go, I've laid all my cards on the table. Tell me I'm a fool. Cheer me on. Try to scam me? I'm here for your advice, both negative and positive.    

What would you do?

1365453372.0,95,self.investing,1bxvv7,Tesla Discussion,113,18,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bxvv7/tesla_discussion/,"I know Tesla has been mentioned a lot but most of those threads are about ""look at how much money I made off Tesla"" or ""Tesla sucks and will be bankrupt within a year."" I kind of want to understand the risks of Tesla a little better. I hear all the time about how Tesla is a bad stock but am unable to get a good explanation on why. Here are the most common ones:

1. The demand for EV's aren't there.
2. The last new car company to become a success was Lamborghini in the 1960s.
3. Tesla doesn't make a profit and is in lots of debt.

But I did some research and came up with some legitimate rebuttals:

1) Tesla's preorders are proof that there is demand. There are sold out through the year. Production is limited but we all heard them announce that they sold more cars than anticipated. Musk also likes to claim that whenever they sell some Model S to a region, orders increase for that region. Therefore, not just the early adopters are trying to buy one. People who see a Model S wants to buy one.

2) I researched other start up companies similar to Tesla. Other than Fisker, Aptera and Better Place were start ups that wanted to sell electric vehicles. Fisker is failing because there was no demand for its car but see above, Tesla doesn't have that problem. 

Aptera failed because they tried to do too much too fast. They wanted to build a mass market electric car with a weird futuristic design. They also put all their eggs into this car. When the leaf and volt came out, it overshadowed what Aptera was trying to do. Tesla is taking things slow, focusing on the luxury market and building cars mainstream car buyers would like to own. They are raising money through selling these higher end cars (with bigger profit margins) and working their way down. Aptera's car also got bad publicity for its poor handling, Tesla's Model S is getting mostly praise for its driving dynamics.

Better Place is another electric car company in Israel but they mostly focus on charging stations. They planned on having vehicles that had swappable batteries. They are currently in trouble because of the red tape with local governments. They are meeting lots of barriers whenever they try to build a station where users can swap out their batteries. Also, Israel does not offer many subsidies to electric cars. Tesla, on the other hand, has lots of friendly government subsidies. Obama is committed to getting 1 million electric cars on the road by 2015. The administration later backed off slightly from the comments but it is clear they have a friendly attitude toward EVs. So Tesla, unlike Better Place, is in a much better environment. They also do not have much of a problem placing its superchargers everywhere.

3) Lastly, Tesla is finally turning a profit and even wants to pay off its DOE loan quicker. Tesla will probably make money throughout the year by selling lots of high margin cars. Their projected margin of 25% doesn't even factor in other parts of the business like selling pollution credits.

Are there any Tesla bears that want to chime in? I would definitely like more insight on the company's risk.",,False,,t5_2qhhq,False,,,True,t3_1bxvv7,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bxvv7/tesla_discussion/,

Meanwhile I could have a portfolio (33% Vanguard 500 Index, 33% Vanguard International Stock Market Index, 33% Vanguard Small-Caps Index) where it's all stocks and sure during the bear markets I will get hit hard but since I live frugally and don't have any big responsibilities like having to pay for a house or having to raise a family, I won't see the losses as frightening as I would see them as a perfect opportunity to buy more (stocks are at a great discount; great bargains).

I'd still be investing in funds that don't have a 100% positive correlation so there will be a sort of averaging out (stocks down in Europe might not necessarily mean stocks are down in USA) and even though it's much riskier, I'm able to afford those risks.

(Also ignore the random dots or dashes you see, I never learned how to format properly so I cheat)

.



**A NEW WAY OF THINKING**

When learning the basics of options, you're taught the principals on the way they work, and although none of that is inaccurate, it is incomplete.

Options are good for all sorts of things.  To list a few popular ones:

* **Hedging**, or trying to keep a steady portfolio from crazy market swings.  This is what teachers in the beginners course referred to when talking about options as a form of ""insurance"" 

* **Trading**, or using clever strategies involving various combinations of options and/or stocks

* **Speculation** aka gambling.  This is mainly because options can swing huge amounts of money with a relatively low price (akin to winning scratch-off lottos).

The one thing you'll notice was not on the list was *investing*.  Options are bad at this by nature mainly because investing implies long term stuff, and options all have ticking time limits.

So how do they do all this? First you have to change the way you think of options.  You learned that they're a contract between 2 parties to buy/sell something at a certain date and price.  But the emphasis that's left out in the beginner's class is that now there's a contract, which previously didn't exist, and that contract is worth money.  That **contract is an actual commodity**, whose value can go up and down as time goes on.  And the owner of that contract can sell it whenever they want, in an open market and without ever having to wait 'till expiration to find out if they were right or wrong.  


.



**""TERMS AND CONDITIONS""**

Few key terms and assumptions (as they come to me and in no particular order).  

* Not a definition, but a word of caution.  It's easy to get the terms buying and selling mixed up with options, so be mindful when you see those words to make sure to know the context.  Here's a quick exercise: ""The seller of a put has the obligation to buy stocks where as the buyer of a put has the option to sell stocks.  Which is different from calls, where the seller has the obligation to sell and the buyer has the option to buy."" If you understood this statement then you're ready to move on.
 

*  **""write""** an option - this literally means sell an options contract, but what makes it special is that if someone ""writes an option"" they're literally drafting up a new contract and creating an option which previously didn't exist in the open market and it will remain there until expiration.

* **contract** - this is the unit of an option.  1 contract means that exactly 100 stocks may be traded upon expiration date.

* **bid/ask spread** - first, bid is the market price to sell something, and ask is the market price to buy something.  And spread is the difference between the two.


.



**THE PRICE**

And this is what it all comes down to, the holy grail of options trading.  Pricing the contract.  Or the *fee* as I've heard it called.

*And honestly it was the topic I really was hoping to focus on.  But in seeing how much information it took to simply set up this main topic that, I think I'll dedicate another post to this if it generates enough interest.  But rather than skipping it altogether, I'll touch on the subject.*

Options prices are decided similar to everything else in the world, which is the market decides.  This means that all you need is for 2 people to agree on a price, then exchange, and then BAM! A new price is set.  For example, I'm willing to buy AAPL for $450.  But I haven't because that son of a bitch just won't stop going the fuck up! (sorry, venting).  Anyways, that also means that whoever owns it right now, doesn't want to sell it to me for so cheap and thinks he can sell it for more.  Therefore we didn't agree and the price is not $450.  But tomorrow, when we wake up and check the price, sure enough the owner will have found someone willing to buy it for like $520 and as soon as they make the exchange, BAM! $520 is the new price tag for it.  And that's literally how it works.  It's actually just like ebay.

However that introduces a new concept involving market conditions, regarding the number of buyers and sellers at the market.  Aka **volume**, aka **liquidity**.  If you have a market for something with a huge number of buyers and sellers, then it's likely that there's a lot of exchanges which will take place, and competition will be stiff.  Think about it, if a seller is trying to rip anybody off, then the buyer will go right next door and buy it for cheaper, and therefore creating a stable price (as the rip off guys either leave or lower their price like).  But if there's an imbalance of buyers and sellers, then control of the price will tip in favor of the smaller group.  For example, if I tried to sell the one and only mona lisa to the world, and assuming there were many buyers who want it, I would probably get a hefty price because I will only sell it to the person who is willing to give me more money than anybody else in the world.  Inversely, if I tried to sell my old XBOX 1 on ebay, I would probably sell it for cheap because in addition to having some competition, I'd also be struggling with finding anyone who even wants one.  And finally, if you have a market where there's very few buyers AND sellers, then really strange stuff can happen because every transaction that takes place could literally be decided by who is better at haggling. 

Now while this is true with stocks, it plays an especially big role with options because market conditions can affect price and changes of pennies at an options level can easily translate to hundreds of dollars in your loss/return

1373923166.0,87,self.investing,1id7pj,On the performance of hedge funds vs. index funds,106,19,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1id7pj/on_the_performance_of_hedge_funds_vs_index_funds/,"Upfront disclaimer:  I am an engineering student at an American university who is currently an intern at a bank.  I have been obsessed with finance since my senior year of high school, and plan on working in finance after college.  This is a throwaway account because I prefer to have very little personal information on my actual account for privacy reasons.

I joined the investing subreddit a little while ago, and have pretty much been a lurker minus a few posts here and there.  I would like to use this post to discuss the widespread negativity towards hedge funds.  I am a bit biased in that I would like to work for a hedge fund one day, but I will try to be as objective as possible and am by no means claiming that I am right.  I would just like to provide the other side of the argument:

As I’m sure most of you know, we have seen an unprecedented expansion of the monetary base by the Federal Reserve since 2008 known as [Quantitative Easing]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing).  Since the bottom of 2009, the S&amp;P 500 Index has increased in value from [676 to 1683](http://i.imgur.com/VN4UXsn.gif) (as of 4:00pm ET), which is a return of almost 150%.  

There has been an increasing amount of scrutiny from both news outlets and retail investors about the hedge fund industry, and how the returns do not justify the exorbitant fees.  Many examples use the industry's performance against the S&amp;P 500 as proof that they are not worth the money.  It is very much true that the hedge fund industry has under-performed the stock market in recent years.  [This graph](http://i.imgur.com/h38Ly1v.gif) plots the most widely used proxy for hedge fund returns from [HFRX](https://www.hedgefundresearch.com/hfrx_reg/index.php?fuse=login_bd) against the S&amp;P 500 since the bottoms of 2009.  However, that is not a reasonable comparison.  Some hedge funds are long-biased equity funds, but most are not, which means comparing returns to the S&amp;P is in many cases comparing apples and oranges.  

By definition, hedge funds are ""hedged"", which means they have positions that ideally benefit from both upward and downward swings in the markets.  Although many still do outperform the market during up years, it's the down years in the market that hedge funds tend to provide the most [alpha](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp), which is a risk-adjusted measure of performance against a benchmark.  The most recent crash is a great example of this; [here](http://i.imgur.com/Z8DhUJZ.gif) is a graph of hedge fund returns vs. the S&amp;P 500 during the heights of the financial crisis.  As you can see, the S&amp;P 500 reached less than half of its value from the peak, while overall hedge funds never went below about 77% of their peak.

Looking further in the past to 1998 (the first full year the HFRX Index existed), we can see that hedge funds have [pretty handily outperformed](http://i.imgur.com/AfKKM4s.gif) the wider stock market, even after fees.

So what has caused hedge funds to perform so poorly recently?  Well, for starters, the markets are becoming more efficient every day, and it is much harder to find low-risk-high-reward trades today than it was even 5 years ago.

However, the cause of most of this lack of alpha is undoubtedly the intervention of the Federal Reserve in the markets.  Institutional investors tend to have greater returns during periods of higher volatility, and during times where individual stock picks do not correlate very closely with the broader market.  Since the financial crisis, the correlation of individual stocks with the broader market has gone from a range of 40-60% to a range of 60-80%.  [Here is a graph](http://i.imgur.com/rjJjUta.png) of the implied correlation of stocks within the S&amp;P 500 since 2007, with the beginning and end of each round of Quantitative Easing labeled for convenience.  

During periods of QE, hedge fund traders have a harder time gaining any kind of edge unless they try to predict the policy decisions of the Federal Reserve, since that is the major driver of the market.  Since the S&amp;P 500 Index has performed so well with the extra liquidity, and so many of the assets that make up the index have moved in tandem with it, institutional investors have had a very hard time finding that edge that they charge the big bucks for.

So, in conclusion, I believe the data shows that the recent abysmal performance of hedge funds relative to the stock market is a result of the extreme outperformance of equities and the high correlation between assets.  I also believe that hedge funds will definitely see a reduction in the fees they will be able to charge over the next few decades, but the top funds will most likely still be justified in making fortunes in the markets.

This post is intended to hopefully dispel some of the myths that have been thrown around in this subreddit, but also to start a conversation about actively vs. passively managed assets.  Please criticize anything I say that you disagree with, but try to provide some sort of evidence for your claims so I don't have to Google around too much, and so I can hopefully respond with something equally insightful.  Thanks!

**EDIT**: I knew I would screw something up in this.  My graph of the implied correlation of stocks doesn't have QE3 labeled.  It started in September of 2012 and is still going today.

**EDIT2**: Some people have correctly pointed out that Hedge Funds are not necessarily ""hedged"".  I don't know why I phrased it the way I did, because Hedge Funds are such a broad category nowadays that they aren't necessarily hedged at all.  I should have said Alternative Investment funds.",,False,,t5_2qhhq,1373936735.0,,,True,t3_1id7pj,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1id7pj/on_the_performance_of_hedge_funds_vs_index_funds/,

I'm a Chartered Accountant who designed [this app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/finalytics/id666540465?ls=1&amp;mt=8) as a pet project. I had some free time and wanted to do something productive. It has been a great learning experience so far.

I noticed that the quality of the financial analysis apps on the itunes store were terrible and realized I could probably create a better version myself. I put together an Excel prototype and outsourced the programming to a freelance developer. I tried to keep the first version as simple as possible to keep costs down, but also to stay focused on the core functionality of the app. My aim was to produce the maximum amount of ratios with the minimum amount of inputs.

I would appreciate it if you guys had a look give me some feedback or tips for improvement. I would like to keep adding to the core functionality of the app, like expanding it to include cash flow ratios or basic valuations.

Apologies of this question has been asked a million times before.  Anyways, I'm a 19 year old and for the first time in my life I have a fairly sustainable income.  I'm working a well paying job and living at home, so I have essentially no costs.  I'd like to invest a few hunded dollars (probably 200-600).  What are some options that I have?  Is this enough money to invest?

The last time I did this was mid-2008 when I cashed everything out and then DCAed back in the market as it was crashing 2009. I'm hoping to do the same thing again and ride this cliff-sale down. 

It's stomach turning to buy as the market is dropping but as Warren Buffett's maxim goes, ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful"" - so here we go again because I smell fear. Any questions about my plans for this ride or how it all worked out in 2008-2009 I'll be happy to answer. 



**Edit 1**: Had some msgs regarding the Nov. Stock Picks competition which I'm currently leading with a short on GRPN. I never short in my trading accounts as I just don't have the stomach for it. I'm a value investor and when I buy something I only do so if it's a stock / index I'm comfortable holding for an indefinite period of time and it's selling at what I believe to be a discount to its intrinsic value. Considering this point and that the natural tendency of the market over time is up I sleep better at night knowing that the worst thing that will happen is that my purchase will average ~7% over the long haul. I can live with that. Rule 1: Don't lose money. I fucking hate losing money.

**Edit 2** Bought a 10% tranche in AAPL this morning (11/15/12) at $529.

At the start of the thread, it is clearly a situation where someone wants to know how to regularly invest sums of money that they expect to actually have access to, maybe plus a bit, in a few years' time - not learn how to day-trade options or other high-risk nonsense - and yet the responses I saw were, simplified (**EDIT:** but still in order of the most votes at the time I posted this):

* 1) ""Open a brokerage account"" followed by one that the commentator later concedes is complex and not for beginners. What, you think this guy with his full-time job needs the headache and risk? He didn't say he did, so unless I'm missing something, he doesn't.

* 2) ""Real estate"" - I can kind of understand how people caught up in the bubble thought they were 'investing' when they were speculating on that market, but real estate is illiquid and highly risky at any time as an 'investment'

* 3) ""Gold. Physical gold"" - Thankfully, at least this one was downvoted, though I suspect over the long haul people would probably do just as well in gold if they bought and held as they would with the other two non-relevant strategies above

* 4) ""Invest in my food cart"" - Actually, this is probably the best option out there. I'm kidding. Half-kidding anyway. At least it helped give me a laugh after I read most of the responses with my jaws wide open.

*How to invest for a 3-to-5-year goal? My answer? Assess your risk tolerance,* **start with bonds**, *and consider, at most, a small allocation of stocks - after all, your number one goal is wealth preservation for short-term needs, not get-rich-quick, gambling-style day-trading to overnight millions.*

Look, I realize this is the internet, and people are gonna do what they wanna do (in living color!), but please, for the love of all that is unholy, **can people stop and think before giving shitty advice? There's a whole SubReddit devoted to that already,** and the folks who come here wanting a simple passive plan don't need to be told about risky, wild, one-off strategies that are anything but sure ways to preserve and grow wealth.

Eric Holder has telegraphed an upcoming decision on how the Justice Department will treat CO and WA's legal marijuana. Obviously this could have a huge impact - both long and short-term - on MJNA and the overall cannabis sector. Let's look at the possible outcomes. But first, a few facts:

- Obama has gone on record as saying there are bigger fish to fry than going after individual users of pot in CO and WA.

- On the other hand, Obama's Drug Czar said last month that the government would go after growers and distributors. http://dailycaller.com/2013/02/20/u-s-drug-czar-we-will-enforce-federal-marijuana-laws/
* Meanwhile, state legislatures across the country have been proposing bills legalizing either medical marijuana or straight-out legalization. Polling in support of legalization has also soared in the wake of the election.

So, what we have here is an indecisive Federal government and a surge of support amongst both citizens and a growing number of legislators at the state level. Against this backdrop, here are three possible decisions and how they might play out.

* *The worst-case scenario*: Similar to what the Drug Czar said recently, the Justice Department takes a firm stance on growers and distributors. They stay as close to the status quo as they can, protecting the law enforcement and prison systems that benefit from prohibition, while maintaining Obama's ""not gonna go after individual users"" policy (they simply don't have the resources.) At the very worst, they could even threaten to prosecute banks and other businesses that deal with pot retailers. The tough language and stance would put the onus on the states to keep on legalizing until the Feds relent.

 * As a result, we'd probably see a huge sell-off in the various cannabis stocks. Once the dust settled, however, it could create a huge long-term buying opportunity; I think it's just a matter of time before the surge at the state level overcomes the Federal opposition.

* *The best-case scenario:* Holder takes a lenient approach to the entire cannabis industry in CO and WA, calling the dogs off of any operation following state law and paving the way for the full retail stores that are going to rolling out in the near future. 
 * The cannabis sector would go bonkers at this news; it would effectively mean that the Feds have given up the war on Pot and left it as a States Rights issue. We could see an explosive rally similar to what happened after the election in November.

* *The Mixed Bag:* Holder issues a vague statement and basically punts, taking a continued wait-and-see approach, maybe with some softer language acknowledging the will of state voters while pointing out that it's up to Congress to legalize on a Federal level.
 * We'd probably see a corresponding mixed reaction in stocks. However, the lack of an iron-fist approach would be a promising sign for investors.

So that's what we're looking at. Unfortunately, I think the worst-case scenario is the most likely. Between the entrenched interests and the ridiculous international drug war treaties, Holder has no incentive to loosen up. The mixed scenario is also a strong possibility. The best-case, I think, is a long-shot.

Whatever happens, though, I don't think these decisions can get in the way of the cannabis sector's long-term growth. What would happen, for example, if CA, OR and other states legalize in 2014? Over time the Feds face an inevitable losing battle against rising support for legal marijuana. That, I think, is what makes the cannabis sector such a compelling investment.

Now to sit back and see what happens.

Full disclosure: I am currently long MJNA, CBIS, PHOT, TRTC, and several other cannabis (or cannabis-related) stocks. (Edit: Those additional stocks are GRNH, ERBB, HEMP, and COIN).

Thanks to everyone again for this great discussion**

**Lots of complaints about the length so here is the TL;DR:**

**We want to provide an automated service to build model-based portfolios at a very low cost based on models that historically outperform the S&amp;P and other lazy portfolio benchmarks.  Cost of the service would be $20/year or .5% of assets, whatever is greater.**

**Video going through backtested results of one of our models, which yielded 12.1% annually in the backtest:
http://screencast.com/t/1kCPzR4Y**

My startup has been trying to bring practical investing to everyday people via http://forcastix.com

I've learned of at least one broker that allows buying and selling of partial shares down to 1/10000 of a share. My thought is that this combined with flat annual fees for the service could enable portfolios down to $500 to get the same love via diversification and careful maintenance that a large portfolio gets; even a small portfolio could own 300 stocks, both domestic and international. This can be done using automated tools and this partial share model. 

We want to make a product that does the portfolio maintenance and construction. 

Would this be something you would use?

Please give the harshest of critism, both on this idea and our current offering. 

**Here are a few questions that came up when I posted the same pitch at /r/startups.  May save some time**

 * Do you know anything about finance?

Forcastix is a federally covered Registered Investment Advisor regulated by the SEC.  So yes, we do.

 * How is this different from a mutual fund?

Mutual funds charge 1-2% in fees + overhead such as transaction costs. The total real expense level can easily hit 3%. Our service would package all overhead and fees in a flat .5% due to the cost savings from partial share ownership. Mutual funds also suffer from strategy drift, the tendency for fund managers to change strategy mid flight to increase single year returns in bad markets, at the expense of long term returns. Our portfolios are machine maintained and tailored to the individual. 

 * How is this different from an ETF?

ETFs have well documented redemption and liquidity issues, and do worse than their underlying assets over the long term. Their fees are low at .5% or less typically.  An identically constructed micro portfolio will always outperform a comparable ETF.

 * Wouldn't some who could only invest 500 be risk averse and not want to buy stocks?

We can change this mentality with education. Stocks in a properly diversified portfolio have out performed all other investments over a 30 year period for the last 120 years for every starting year except 1929. Education of these facts will change the perception of risk in the stock market. 

 * What kind of returns can someone reasonably expect using the ""Micro Portfolio""

The S&amp;P averages 7% per year.  From our extensive modeling and backtesting, we believe we can net 9% per year over a term of over 20 years using automatically managed micro portfolios.

 * The S&amp;P averages 7% a year.  You are advocating that active management in a micro portfolio nets 9% per year.  Isn't that a small gain for the trouble?

Over the long term with compounding, no.  Over 20 years with a $500 investment, 9% annual returns will give a final balance of $3004 after 3.3% inflation.  The same starting amount at 7% would end up at $2019.  Total returns of almost 100% more for only a change in 2% annually.

Lets look at this another way.  Using the ""rule of 72"" shortcut, lets analyze returns of a 1% savings account, a 3% CD, a 5% Bond, the 7% from the S&amp;P, and 9% from a micro portfolio.  The first will double your money in 72 years, the second will double your money in 24 years, the third in 14 years, the fourth in 10 years and the final in 8 years.  So its really a question of how valuable is your time. Why reach your savings goals in 72 years or even 10 years, when you can reasonably do so in a short amount of time.

 * What do you charge for this?

.5% of the total value of the portfolio or $20 annually, which ever is greater.

 * 20 bucks a year in fees? It sounds too good to be true.

The fee is low because the technology is cheap, and partial share ownership is worlds cheaper than executing orders in a brokerage account.  Think of it as the old farmer's co-op.  They only worked when you had enough people involved to justify the large purchase.  Similarly, partial share ownership only works if you have enough people playing.  

 * I'm a financial idiot and want to invest $2000. What can you do for me that I can't do myself, how much can I expect, why should I pick you, how fast can I get my money back out?

You pick one of 3 very good portfolios. Historical yield will be 9% per year. We maintain the portfolio, you fund it when ready. You add money any time. You can withdraw whenever you like but we prefer you hold the money in the account for at least 5 years. We bill quarterly, .5% annual flat rate or $20, whichever is greater. A $2000 portfolio would incur a bill of $5 per quarter.

 * So if this is so cheap, how does Forcastix benefit?

There is a serious gain here for Forcastix in what we are calling the ""Micro Portfolio Market"".  By lowering the floor of an actively managed account, we can now intercept savers earlier in their life, before they put all their money in the savings account, or a company 401k, or their house, or a vacation property, or any other place that typically collects money used for long term investments.  By giving them peace of mind that their portfolio is getting the utmost care (and proving this by showing them how they are beating the benchmarks like the DOW, the S&amp;P, CD rates, etc.) we can turn traditional savers into market investors earlier in life.  These accounts, down the road, will become much larger.  At .5% in fees, our first million comes from managing only 200M$.  Managing $2B takes us to $10 Million, $20B to $100 Million, and so on.  There are trillions of dollars under management right now, and I believe trillions more out there not being managed because they don't reach the floor of a managers consideration.  There are, from what I have calculated, 1.5 Billion people earthwide that have enough discretionary income to save (they aren't living day by day).  Your getting a third of that from India and China alone, the rest coming from the developed world.  If each of these people funded a $500 account, this would create $750B in managed funds.  At .5% in fees, this is a market of 3.7B annually.  This is the floor of the market.  You can play with the numbers to find the ceiling.  My guess is its somewhere between 10-20 Trillion in funds netting fees of 50-100B annually.",,False,,t5_2qhhq,True,,,True,t3_tl1z2,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tl1z2/if_someone_with_a_500_portfolio_could_get_the/,

1302450800.0,76,self.investing,gmr0k,Top 10 things I've learned about people like you by loaning them money,84,8,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gmr0k/top_10_things_ive_learned_about_people_like_you/,"I help finance personal and business loans through Prosper.com and LendingClub.com and you learn quite a lot about people loaning them money.  

The majority of loans I fund are people paying off high interest credit cards, but I'll also help fund a well conceived business plan.  Since I just had to go through all the documentation for tax season, thought I'd share some of the more interesting observations I've picked up going through my spreadsheets on current and past loans. Some of these I can back up with statistics, but most of these are anecdotal observations (in other words, YMMV).  Appropriate due diligence, read the prospectus etc, etc.  

1) Most people actually pay their bills on time, unless there are extenuating circumstances like a job loss or illness.  That was the biggest surprise for me in the age of strategic defaults.  

2) People who take pride in their on-time payment record are the least likely to be late or default.  

3) Banks and credit card companies give greater weight to homeowners on the assumption they're more reliable than renters, but that trend isn't reflected among my borrowers.  There is no statistical difference in either defaults or late payments between home owners and renters in my portfolio (this data is disclosed in the loan application).

4) Most people who get into trouble with credit cards and then fight their way clear actually do learn their lesson.  Of all the pay off loans I've helped fund, only a tiny fraction come back for another one later.

5) There is no statistical difference in loss rate between loans I select manually and those where I use an automated plan.  In other words, I could throw darts at loan listings (printing them out first, of course) and do just as well as reading the listings.  I still prefer manual bids, even though from a statistical standpoint it's a false sense of security.

6) Even though no information about a lenders gender or race is disclosed, sometimes you can guess from the loan request.  When there is some clue, I record it in the comment field.  On the notes I can track it (about 40%), there's no racial or gender difference in payment records.  I've loaned money to people of almost every race and economic circumstance.  Being blind to those considerations is the law but it's also good business.  A minority single mom with the determination to make a better life for her kids is a better risk than a doctor in my book.

7) Early pay offs are just as likely to be people with poor credit as top rated borrowers.  In the last six months I've had four early payoffs: those were a AA, HR, C and B notes.  Going back through all of them, there's no statistical pattern I can find.  There is very good statistical correlation between their credit rating and default rate, but not on early payoffs.

8) Some people starting their own business have been working on their business plan for years and it really shows.  Successful business plans can tell me exactly where every dollar borrowed is going to go and how those acquisitions will increase cash flow.  The better the business plan, the more likely you'll see an early pay off.  

9) Most people are honest.  I know that flies in the face of conventional wisdom, but that's my experience.  There are a few bad eggs out there, it's inevitable.  But the majority are actually pretty decent. Definitely people deserve better treatment than they're getting at the hands of most large financial institutions.   

10) Banks and credit card companies are full of shit.  I realize there's a world of difference in the size of our statistical bases, but unless you're working at that scale, the things they think are important qualities in borrowers are, in my experience, pure hokum.  I've been ripped off by people at the higher end of the income scale far more often than by people at the lower end.  My opinion is that big banks micro manage statistics and sometimes reach faulty conclusions.  

Now, would I be able to duplicate these stats by making personal loans directly to people I know?  Probably not.  The fact it's structured and goes on their credit report if they default must motivate a lot of people.

The land is currently being rented out for $210 per acre.  In addition, farmland rents (and values) have been increasing by 4-6 percent annually. 

I like the idea of farmland over most real estate because there are no buildings to maintain and very little that needs fixing (I am not 'handy'.)  The land is irrigated and maintaining irrigation system could be a potential expense.  I don't know how much real estate taxes would be, but I've heard taxes on farmland are low.

I'm struggling understanding if this is a good investment.  I believe farmland will hold its value well in part because of the increasing global population and as people say in these parts ""they aint makin' any more of it"".

The Nikkei hasn't seen this kind of boost in nearly a decade. Are we at the top? Doubtful. 



Abenomics is fighting an uphill battle - an aging and shrinking population combined with a culture of stingy spending has led to a 10 year lull in Japanese markets and gradual deflation. In case you are unfamiliar, Shinzō Abe elected fall 2012, the prime minister, has made inflation his **economic policy**. Broadly, this aims to spur growth for exports while simultaneously providing incentive to the Japanese people to spend sooner than later. The real trick is whether the japanese people will actually change their spending habits - Abe has vowed inflation by any means necessary, so they may have no choice. 



Its more complex than that, and nobody really knows what to expect, but the party is just getting started. Take a gander at some of these tasty stock charts which track the Japanese markets, the USD/Yen ratio, Japanese conglomerates or Japanese banking industry.

My Notes to the book, ‘How To Pick Stocks like Warren Buffett. The author is Timothy Vick, 2001.

This is my second read of this book.  I originally read it on January 15, 2001 and rated it a 10 out 10.  My second read was not as revolutionary for me, but still it offered excellent thought in future or continued framework of my strategies for portfolio development and maintenance.

These notes are hardly all inclusive.  I merely am identifying several of the sections, which I will perhaps refer to in the future.

1.	“You should update your checklist periodically to make sure your target prices are reasonable.  If a company’s growth prospects dwindle, the original buying price you set might be too high.  Conversely, if the company’s fundamentals improve, the stock may not retreat to your buying level again.  In such cases, you must reappraise the company to determine whether it is truly worth a higher share price.”

2.	He presents a table as follows:

Company	Current Price	Buy Price	Comments

3.	“By averaging past earnings, you obtain a more realistic appraisal and avoid extrapolating unsustainable trends into the future.”  Vick explains that Graham taught Buffett the concept of averaging earnings.  I think using 10 year average earnings is a worthwhile discussion in any investment thesis. 

4.	Vick mentions that Buffett requires an expected annualized 15% ROI on any of his portfolio companies.

5.	“Extended bull markets, you see, tend to obscure logic.”

6.	“Warren Buffett craves consistency because consistency helps remove risk from a stock portfolio.”

7.	“Stocks are bonds with less predicable coupons.” 

Vick’s Six Rules for Comparing Stocks to Bonds:

A.	Your overriding goal as a stock investor is to find companies whose returns can beat inflation.

B.	Secondary goal is to beat the risk-free rates of returns of government bonds, which are already priced to anticipate inflation.

C.	The proper way of comparing a stock’s potential return to a bond’s return is to compare their respective coupons.

D.	When possible, you should try to buy a stock whose current earnings yield is near or above yields on a long-term bond.

E.	The only time you should accept earnings yields that are lower than bond yields is when the company is growing and is expected to generate an earnings yield that would soon surpass bond yields.

F.	Buying growth companies at the cheapest possible price is the best way to ensure that you can beat bond yields by a wide margin.

Investment vs Speculation

* There is a difference between investing and speculation 
* There is intelligent speculation and intelligent investing
* Unintelligent speculation includes speculating with money you can't afford to lose, and speculating seriously while lacking the skill to do so.
* Anyone who is buying a ""hot"" stock or on margin, realisizes they are speculating/ gambling
* Put aside a small portion or fund for speculating reasons of your portfolio.
* Speculations can be good for startups and new companies who need the capital for expansion (Amazon, Edison Electric etc.)
* Never get add more money into your fund just because of the ""hype"" or the heat just because profits are going in. 
* One can't predict the behavior of the markets, so instead, one must learn how to predict and control one's own behavior
Defensive Investors
* One can't hope for better than average results by buying new offerings or hot issues just for a quick profit. Once they're known to the public, the profitability of the stock is gone.  It is better for a defensive investor to confine himself to shares of important companies with profitable operations and strong financial conditions.
* A defensive investor can use dollar cost averaging, which the practitioner invests in common stocks the same amount of dollars each month/ quarter or time interval. In this way, the investor can  invest in a stock, no matter what price and isn't affected by the media and other factors. 
* Quoted from Random Walk Down Wall Street- Dollar cost averaging doesn't eliminate risk but it will help your portfolio from a punishing bear market. You will buy more shares at a lower price while buying less shares at a higher price. It always is better to buy stocks at a lower price, especially if one is going to be a future stock investor. 
* Warren Buffet ""Prospective purchasers should much prefer sinking prices""

Aggressive Investors 

* Aggressive investors want better results than defensive/passive investors. But those with a lot of energy and passion andstudy can end up with losses instead of profits. 
* This includes: Trading and short selling, which can carry massive losses if one's predictions are wrong. If the price of stocks go up, they'll have to cover those losses.
* This includes:  Buying stocks that are expected increased earnings, or based on a track of past growth and suggested to continue grow, even if the company may not have the results. (promising companies with new technology that looks promising)
* These  methods are looked down upon, as the first method of trading isn't based on thorough analysis. Trading constantly also incurs large fees which eat away profits. 
* Looking for promising stocks simply based on this years or past years results, or being told what to expect is looked down upon as past results dont always guarantee future results. If one is being told that a stock is expected tog row, it is likely others have found the same thing.  The market may already reflect what the aggressive investor is anticipating.
* To enjoy a reasonable chance for better than average results, which in itself is only a chance and not guaranteed and also very difficult, investors must follow policies which are sound and promising and not popular on wall street. 
* Warren Buffet ""Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful""
* Stock brokers make money when you trade, despite losses or profits. All this active and massive trading incurs losses and isn't profitable over time. Everyone is encouraged to trade fast and constantly, which has brain washed our society of investing and speculation. Everyone makes decisions in a instant, without thoroughly analyzing their stock and if their falling/rising prices justified them selling/dumping or buying a stock.  People are easily swayed by the masses and mass media talking about how hot a stock is, or making predictions about a stock. It is better to step away from all of this. 
* One doesn't just dump stocks because their share prices has fallen, they should ask if the value of the company has changed, or perhaps buy more stock as it is on sale! 
* By speculating, you lower your own odds of building wealth. To earn money investing, one must thoroughly analyze a company and its soundness of business before buying its stock. Buying a stock is like buying a piece of an actual company, not just to be thrown away.
* you must aspire to adequate, not extraordinary performance, and * Investors calculate what stocks are worth, while speculators gamble that a stock price will go up and someone else will pay more for it. The investor judges market prices by standards of value while speculators base their standards on market price.  Investing isn't about being temporarily right, it is about being right in the long term to achieve lon term financial goals.
* Risky techniques such as day trading and ignoring diversification and flipping hot mutual funds, following stock picking systems only worked in the short run as they didn't follow Grahams criteria for investing ( thorough analysis, adequate performance and protecting against major losses) 
* The market is there to serve you.
* If one looks a large quantity of data long enough, a huge number of patterns will emerge- even by chance. 
* One must always remember the dangers of speculating.

I thought this will be a great time to give a TA lesson on how to trade this thing!

Here is a fresh chart I just made: http://i.imgur.com/7U1Y6.gif

The first thing to understand is that nobody can predict the future. Nobody can tell you what will happen tomorrow or next week, but what we can do it make a plan and be prepared for what MIGHT happen.

Trading is all about having a plan, then minimizing your losses if your plan was wrong, but maximizing your gains if it was right. A good trader will make 9 bad small trades, but have 1 good big trade that will make up for all the losses and then some!

Plan: Try play this head n shoulders to the downside

Risk: The market may rally higher here and you take a loss

Reward: The pattern playing out and profiting from the downside


Head and shoulders:

This is a very simple bearish pattern, if the Dow makes a move below the ""neckline"" or that 11650 support, it basically means the buyers that were there last time are no longer there and the odds of further downside has increased.

So how should a trader play this? The ideal trade would be to get your shorts on as close as possible to the high of the right shoulder we are putting in right now. As you can see the recent high on this leg was 12060, so grabbing your shorts here with a stop at those highs gives you a tight and well defined are of risk. 

Why 12060? personally this is the level I would be using because it was the high on Thursday which was tested again this morning and we reversed off it again.

Bull scenario:

If the Dow keeps rallying and takes out 12060, guess what? You get stopped out! Take your loss! The market will always show you who is right and who is wrong. If you think the market should be going down from here, but it does not , you are wrong! Take your small loss and wait for the next set up.

Bear scenario:

If you take your short positions here and the market keeps moving in your favor, that neckline at 11650 is the level to watch. If we break through, stick to the trade, if it bounces off it, take some profits. This all depends on your risk tolerance and time horizons.

Questions or comments? Feel free to chime in.

Disclaimer: If you do not know how to trade this market, the worst thing you can do is take advice from strangers on the internet.

** Edit: Nov 7 16:34 **

Everything was looking good to the downside until a sharp intraday reversal hit at 2pm. This market has been extremely news headline sensitive, today being a prime example. Buyers charged in on rumors from Europe that the Greek PM is changing (not news because we already know this). Regardless of the fact that this does nothing to fix the situation in Europe, the market made its move and that 12060 level and closed at 12068. You need to honor your stops, no point in holding a position if its working against you.

E-cigarettes are a very interesting market. Sales were around $300 million in 2012. This pales in comparison to the entire cigarette market, which experienced sales of $80+ billion during the same period. However, the market for e-gigarettes doubled last year, and it's expected to double again. 

The reason being: e-gigarettes provide the benefit of regular cigarettes but few of the negatives (tar, smell, second-hand smoke). That's not to say that e-cigarettes are 100% good for you, but they're significantly better than smoking the regular variant.

The big issue in this whole ordeal is government. Many governments believe that there is not yet enough proof of the benefits e-cigarettes for the companies to state the health benefits. However, with Lorillard's purchase of Blu (an e-cigarette firm), the entrance of big tobacco may be able to make the much needed push to really get things moving.

Now comes the interesting part. How do you make money off of all this. Well, to the best of my knowledge, as a retail investor you really can't yet. Lorillard is a public company, but e-cigarettes make up a fraction of their business so you would not earn much of a significant return. The major player in the market right now is NJOY. They control roughly 40% of the market, and could potentially be taken over by Altria Group.

So, as it stands now, your best bets are: 

1) Invest in Lorillard and hope that they can grow their share of the e-cigarette market 

2) Invest in Altria Group and hope that they takeover NJOY and can sustain NJOY's strong growth

3) Wait and see

Personally, I think it's too early to make any strong investments in the market. It's a growing market, but there are too many variables at play right now. It will be fun to see which major tobacco companies make the biggest moves in the realm. It could potentially shake up the industry. 

The tobacco market really resembles the PC market from a few years ago. Before the iPad was introduced a desktop/laptop was the only computer a person had. Now, many people are ditching their computers for tablets. In fact, Apple is expected to sell more iOS devices than Microsoft will sell Windows devices in 2013. We could potentially see that drastic of a market change in the tobacco industry in the coming years.

But for now, I think it's best to wait it out and see who emerges as a market leader in the e-cigarette market.

These books seem to all hit at one thing especially: that the active investor that tries to predict the market will, on average, not do as well as the passive investor who diversifies and invests long term.  At least, that is a major point I got out of those books.  It seems to me that they showed that the passive investor who uses unmanaged mutual funds (or things like it) keeps his fees low, and generally, has a higher rate of return.  

But the attitudes of the subreddit itself seem to contradict the books it recommends.  Many of the posts are people talking about individual stocks, and trying to predict where it and the market will go.  Are people just using a small part of their money to invest aggressively, knowing the risks are high, but not worrying about it… or am I grossly misunderstanding the ideas in the books I read?

Bonds are usually considered a safe investment, because you are guaranteed to be paid a fixed rate - a piece of bad news can't torpedo your investment and reduce its value by 50% overnight, like in the stock market. However, in today's financial climate bonds carry much greater risk than ""common sense"" dictates. If this is too long for you, there is a tl;dr at the end.


**Why bonds are a riskier investment than most people realize**


Bonds have two sources of risk: (1) Risk of default and (2) interest rate risk. The first of these is pretty obvious: If the issuer of your bond goes bankrupt, they will stop making interest payments and you won't get your money back. In some cases, this risk can be considerable (junk bonds) and you need to be really careful that your bonds pay enough to offset this risk. Risk of non-payment is pretty easy to understand. Interest risk is much more subtle, and I'll make an attempt to explain it.

Let's say you have 1 million dollars to invest, and you decide to buy a 30-year US Treasury bond at 3% (bonds are usually bought through a fund, but this is how things work for the funds and, eventually, you). The rules are as follows: You pay 1 million dollars to the US Treasury. Every year, the Treasury will pay you 30,000 dollars in interest. After 30 years, Treasury returns your 1 million dollars. You have earned 3% interest per year, before inflation.

Now, what if after say, 5 years, you want to do something else with your 1 million dollars? Your agreement with the US government runs for 25 more years, and it can't be cancelled. However, you can sell your bond to someone else. Simple: You find a buyer (say, Joe), and he pays you whatever he thinks the bond is worth. Typically, this will be exactly 1 million dollars, minus maybe a small fee for taking the bond off your hands.

But what if the interest rate on newly-issued Treasury bonds has increased to 4% during the 5 years you held the bond? Joe would be a moron to buy your 3% bond for 1 million dollars - he can get a higher yield by purchasing a new bond from the US Treasury! In fact, your 3% bond will pay out about 750,000 dollars in interest during the remaining 25 years, while a new Treasury bond would pay out 1 million dollars in the same period. Joe would lose 250,000 dollars over 25 years if he bought your 3% bond at face value. So he will pay you less than 1 million dollars for the bond. You have lost money due to the higher interest rate. Of course, you could _keep_ your bond for 25 more years, but in the end you will have less money than if you had made a different investment. So for all intents and purposes, you have lost part of your investment.

In fact, if the ""external"" interest rate is high enough, your 1 million dollar bond could be almost worthless until it gets closer to the date when the US Treasury will give back your 1 million dollars. Of course, if the yield for 30-year bonds has decreased to 2% instead, your bond will be worth _more_ than 1 million dollars in the second-hand market.

Here's the kicker: The ""flight to safety"" after the Financial Crisis has pushed bond yields close to zero. And bond yields _cannot_ fall below zero. However, there is no upper bound to how high yields can climb. And a small increase in interest rates will cause a huge fall in the value of long-term bonds. The result is that in the long term, events that cause higher interest rates (improving economic conditions, inflation) pose a huge risk to bond values. Your bond investments aren't as safe as you may have been led to believe. If investors suspect that long-term interest rates are about to increase, bond values will plummet and there will be a stampede of bondholders through the emergency exits. Someone will get trampled.

Hope this gives a reasonably good overview of the subject - I am no economist, but I hope I've got a reasonably good grasp of these concepts. I don't believe that bonds should be shunned, but they are massively overbought at the moment. The risks are larger than most people realize. And I haven't even talked about inflation yet! Inflation has been 1.5-3.0% since 2009, **completely wiping out** any real returns from government bonds. Investors are signing up for all the risk and no reward. They are actually borrowing money to the US Government for free. This baffles me. Meanwhile, stocks are cheaper than they have been in years, often providing yields in excess of 7%. But investors seem to be shellshocked and avoid them at all costs.

If anyone has any thoughts to on this subject, please share them in the comments. The movement of investment capital is fascinating, and it's fun to look at the long-term implications of investors' choices.

**Tl;dr:** Bonds are dangerous because they lose value if interest rates increase. Interest rates are at historically low levels, and cannot decrease a lot from today's levels. They can, however, increase a lot. When 30-year interest rates are below 3%, bonds have a long-term risk profile that is eerily similar to stocks. So think twice before putting all your life savings in bonds, and think twice before you buy into the common belief that ""US Treasury Bonds are the safest investment in the world"".

~~Sigh, heres a big request, reddit... I need help. What can I do? What can he do? Will A123 go up maybe? What do you think? I don't care if this gets all the dislikes in the world. As long as one person, even one... Can give us something to work from.~~

Thank you for taking your time to read this.
Thank you even more if you post with advice and what we can do. 
Thank you.

**BIG EDIT: Thank you everyone for the comments and advice! It really helped me out! Thank you thank you thank you! He and I will learn from this. He is in a very deep depression hit but I know he has the strength to overcome this. 

We were able to sell the stock at .0604. Better then nothing, right? He will being writing off the loss in tax returns. Unfortunately no Christmas for us! But, I think it's good enough we have a roof over our heads and especially have each other. He's all I got!

* [Buying the 10 day low: a back test]( http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1dg0xf/buying_the_10_day_low_a_back_test/)
* [Analysis of a trading strategy: Buy the 10 day low]( http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fr0z8/analysis_of_a_trading_strategy_buy_the_10_day_low/)

tl;dr: 
I’m analyzing a trading strategy with the signals:

*Buy*: 

* Price &gt; 200 SMA and
* Price &gt; 50 SMA and
* New 10 day low

*Sell*

* Price &lt;  50 SMA or
* New 10 day high or
* Open for 10 days

Not much has changed since the last time I posted but many of you have asked me to update when my program began trading real time.  This is still largely in the works but I’ve had a rough skeleton of my program running for the past month or so.  I have three strategies running, here they are:  

*Note:  My program is running in my Google Drive folder so I can view my portfolios at any time.  They should be updated every 10-15 minutes.  You shouldn’t need a Google account to view them.*

[Original strategy:]( https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzUYIetYS5H5c0pyeUlnQjNmemc/edit?usp=sharing) 

* Open Trades:  3
* Closed trades: 10
* Initial Amount: $10,000
* Portfolio Value: $10,612
* Return: 6.12%

[Buy 50 day MA:]( https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzUYIetYS5H5NmxjYzZZcjdaMzQ/edit?usp=sharing)

**Buy:** Price &gt; 50 SMA

**Sell:** Price &lt; 50 SMA

* Open Trades:  3
* Closed trades: 0
* Initial Amount: $10,000
* Portfolio Value: $10,948
* Return: 9.14%

[Buy 200 day MA:]( https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzUYIetYS5H5dkdxNnZXYUZsaTg/edit?usp=sharing)

**Buy:** Price &gt; 200 SMA

**Sell** Price &lt; 200 SMA

* Open Trades:  3
* Closed trades: 0
* Initial Amount: $10,000
* Portfolio Value: $10,727
* Return: 7.27%

Over the past month I’ve noticed the last two strategies have been outperforming mine but have also been much more volatile. I assume this is because my strategy is locking in profits and closing trades while the other two are just riding a trend.  I still have a lot more data to collect; I just figured I’d give you an update. 

**Now onto my program**

This is open source(ish).  I’m going to supply you with everything I’m working with and it’s going to be up to you to navigate it.  I’ll gladly answer questions but this program is still in its infancy and I’ve yet to write extensive documentation on how to use it.  

* Link to download: [http://snk.to/f-cdu5y33u]( http://snk.to/f-cdu5y33u)

I will highlight two features that some people may find useful.  One is an easy way to extract daily Yahoo data and the other an easy way to track your portfolio. 

[Here is the home page in Excel.]( http://imgur.com/k5Nq1Ct)

As you can see there is a section to list the file name of your portfolio and also an area where you can collect data.  Hit the maco button and you’ll end up with:

I understand the properties of Gold, and that it is a very special and rare metal, but do we still use it as in the importance it had in the past?

The only places I have seen gold is in jewlery and some incredible expensive cars or very expensive electrical things. It's a great conductor of electricity but it's not a normal thing and there are alternatives.

It makes sense in the past when it was so easy to work on it and it was basically the first discovered metal. And as it neither corrodes nor tarnishes was great for their appliances, which wasn't ornamentals. 

And later when Gold became a currency and a coin, it still made sense.

But I can't follow todays logic as to why is it so important, as far as I know. Yeah, some countries still have gold reserves that relate with their current currency, but not all countries, and the real value as far as I know has been lost compared to the past.

There seem to be great alternatives for every appliance today. Yet is still an important value today.

Hollywood accounting (also known as Hollywood bookkeeping)[1] refers to the opaque accounting methods used by the film, video and television industry to budget and record profits for film projects. Expenditures can be inflated to reduce or eliminate the reported profit of the project thereby reducing the amount which the corporation must pay in royalties or other profit-sharing agreements, as these are based on the net profit.

Both you and I should be each getting $500,000.

So now, both you and I each make a profit of $400,000 each ABC Widgets company. But now I have an additional profit of $200,000 from XYZ Consultants. In effect, I have syphoned a $100,000 off you.

I am a 31 year old Canadian with around $500k to invest. I make enough each year so that I don't need to cut into these funds unless a great business opportunity comes along. Therefore I could conceivably have this money ""sitting"" in investments for the next 30+ years.

When I research historical returns of some of the main options (in my very limited knowledge base) I see the annualized returns for the S &amp; P index are 9.77% since 1926, for the TSX index it's around 10% as well. Small cap indices are even higher, and a mix of bonds are a little lower. I understand obviously that a given asset class can get hammered in any given year and that past performance is no guarantee of future performance... 

But I was wondering with such a long time horizon, does it make sense to put the money in historically riskier, higher reward things like small cap stocks or general stock indices? It seems like while stock indexes may do worse than safer options over a period of years, over any 30 year period they've provided better returns than safer alternatives. Does this make sense, or would you still diversify across a number of markets and asset types? 

I appreciate any general recommendations on strategy or specifics about what you would invest in.

**Edit 1:** Kudos to you brave souls who have already made your picks. For those that are complaining, just pick a ticker. It's a game, lighten up and have some fun!

**Edit 2:** Still waiting on ""stockbroker"" (ironic, no?) to make his call. Lots of pixels spilled in this thread but no ticker symbol yet. All work and no play makes stockbroker a dull boy;-)

**Edit 3:** Edits on your pick posts will DQ them. Thanks for playing along - this will be interesting. There are some great picks in here. I'd like to say I'm going to put them on a spreadsheet (like the monthly Stock Picks contest) but I seriously doubt I'll get to it.

Feel free to ask me anything. I am not a guru, and am just looking to help aspiring traders by cutting through the many misconceptions that exist around trading.

I have spent a LOT of time learning how to trade consistently and profitably. I have also spent a LOT of time learning how to do things that do not work. What works for me may differ with what works for you, I can only comment based on my own experience of what works.

I have tried using hundreds of different indicators and combinations thereof, I have also done extensive backtesting and data mining and can advise somewhat on my experience with that. I have tried trading with EAs. 

However, these are things that do not work for me. 

I consistently and profitably trade using horizontal support and resistance and a fibonacci scale. This method is sometimes referred to as ""Price Action"" or ""Naked"" trading in online forums. I also use angular support and resistance (trendlines), but less often. The market is very simple if you let it be.

I trade patterns that constantly repeat themselves in the market. They repeat consistently, I see them again and again and again. I do not know the outcome of each trade before I take it. I cannot tell the future, and I do not believe anyone who says that they can. Because I cannot tell the future, I cannot eliminate losing trades entirely, and they form part of my profitable trading.

I owe much of my initial trading belief to a group of traders that I met online. I have since met these people in person to confirm their situations. Their advice has always been free and I am deeply thankful for their mentoring, these traders helped me to believe that consistently profitable trading was possible. These traders trade different markets using different methods, but each is able to be consistenly profitable and trade for a living. I believe that having profitable traders to talk to day-in-day-out greatly helps the learning process.

Having said that, I do not currently trade for a living and I do maintain a fulltime job. This will change in years to come as I get a better idea of what to expect from the market week to week, month to month. Trading Forex is not a consistent income in the same way that a wage is - profits fluctuate, as the market is dynamic - and there are practicalities that need to be considered before I leave the workforce and commit to trading fulltime. 

I am currently learning to trade the DAX by paper trading. I aim to take smaller profts on a daily basis from the DAX to supplement my Forex trading. This more consistent income will assist me in being able to leave the workforce.

A large amount of capital is NOT necessarily required to trade for a living..

While I'm making contributions, I've been playing around with ThinkScript. I learn best by doing, so I decided to program the Turtle Rules and let them run wild on a paper money account:

Besides being the name of a musical group from the 60's, The Turtles are:

* [PDF of the original Turtle Trading rules.](http://originalturtletrader.com/originalturtlerules.pdf)


I don't expect the Turtle Rules to make money in today's market. The point of the exercise is to get comfortable with ThinkOrSwim Desktop, ThinkScript, and options/futures in general while my contributions build up. 

Before the comment section get's flooded with warnings, I don't plan on letting *any* algorithm run on my live money account until I am confident in its probability of success. If I never become that confident, I will probably just invest in dividend paying blue chips. Regardless, I expect the learning process to be rewarding in and of itself.  

Some ThinkScript Resources:

* [Literally all the ToS supplied documentation that exists.](https://www.thinkorswim.com/tos/thinkScriptHelp.jsp?laf=dark)

* [Where ToS support sent me when I asked if there's more info.](http://www.thinkscripter.com/tag/thinkscript/) 


The guy that runs the ThinkScripter site will actually give you ""Turtle"" code if you subscribe to his site, but ready to run code is not what I'm after. I want to understand the scripting language and implement the algorithm myself.

If and when I am able to successfully auto-trade the Turtle Rules on a ToS paper money account, the next logical step would be to start changing the rules for entry, exit, etc to something that will actually make money.

What I expect I can do however,  is learn enough about trading to define my own entry and exit rules for a successful trend following system and automate it. The Turtles proved it can be done with some basic parameters. I want to get to the point where I understand enough to select my own parameters. The Turtle Rules wouldn't do well in today's high volatility market. But for every market there should be a set of rules that will succeed.

23 (unmarried) Currently own a townhouse outright in a very nice townhouse community that is worth $150K. I've lived here about 2 years now. Earn roughly $41K/yr, roughly $13K saved for retirement and $37K in investments. 

I found a plot of land for $10K in a very nice neighborhood, in a very desired area. Homes within a a mile are worth $500K-1Mil and never go on the market. Good schools, lot is a block away from a private school, etc. Home values in the immediate neighborhood are approximately $180K for an older home to 220K for a home that has been updated in this neighborhood, and all of the houses and yards are very well maintained. I could build to a high standard for about $150-160K, and the house would be worth about $200K if I were to sell it.

Townhouse could quite easily bring in $1150/month in rental income. Major structural items that could go wrong with the townhouse (roof, windows, etc) are covered by the HOA. The dues are extremely low, and the HOA itself is in excellent financial shape. 

Am I crazy to think that it would be sensible to build a house, move, and then hold on to and rent out the townhouse as an investment property? The rental income for the townhouse would outstrip the cost of a mortgage close to about $150-250 a month. 

Mortgage looks like it would be about 3% with a payment of about 850/month.

&gt; Actively trading is not a bad idea. The average long-term buy and hold types earn 5-10% a year. **By actively trading, you can earn returns upwards of 1000% in a year if you understand short-term analysis and are well disciplined in risk management.** Most people in this forum simply lack the time, aptitude, discipline, and critical reasoning needed to trade successfully, and thus will advise against it. Actually most people in general are ignorant, lazy, or stupid.

Alright, let's see it. If you're shooting for 1000% a year, by my quick napkin calculations if you start with just $1,000 you should hit $100,000,000,000 (twice Warren Buffet's net worth) in about 8 years. You profess to have the traits required, so tell us now: will you come back here in 8 to 10 years and show us the error of our ways by coming out as the world's richest man or not?

&gt; **I consistently trade options on average earning 5-20% (after fees, taxes are figured as wages) per trade. A very conservative figure is ROI of 5% a week. If you can't see how simple this is trading options, then you're a fucking moron. If you lack the aptitude, dedication, or time to do earn profits approaching 200% ROI a year, only speak for yourself.**

Your weaker claim is for doubling money annually (which you backed down to after I called you on the 1000%), so let's explore that for a moment. 1) $10,000 -&gt; 2) $20,000 -&gt; 3) $40,000 -&gt; 4) $80,000 -&gt; 5) $160,000 -&gt; 6) $320,000 -&gt; 7) $640,000 -&gt; 8) $1,280,000 -&gt; 9) ~$2,500,000 -&gt; 10) $5,000,000+ ... so what year are you at?

By year ten, you should have 5 million. Around 20 or a few years after, you should be around the richest man in the world. So anyone who can't be the richest man in the world within twenty-five years is a ""fucking moron""? To quote Duncan MacLeod: *""There can be only one!""*

Look, I get it - you're for active trading. That's great. But please, stop telling new investors they can be the next Warren Buffet if they are smart and try hard.

I read a lot of post that say, ""*is now a good time to invest in XYZ stock?*"" It seems to me that you guys are looking for quick money and that you are trying to time the markets. **This is nearly impossible** to be successful at for the long term. 

I thought I would share my thoughts on how I invest, and how I invest my clients money. (Well over $10 million btw, not bragging, just trying to establish my credibility and by no means is that a lot compared to some financial planners.)


My methods of investing:

* Invest in the long term because that's where the real money is
* Don't pull out of the market because it's going down, that means invest more while it is cheaper
* Mutual funds
* A balanced portfolio is key to long term success.
* Don't react to the news
* Rebalance every few months, and keep an eye on things throughout (That doesn't mean trade constantly).
* Invest in funds with ZERO transaction fees, No load fees or anything of the sort. This means that **every trade I make is FREE** 


I have other screening methods for investing in mutual funds that I would be happy to elaborate on if you guys are interested. I pity the fool that invests in bonds. Pure stupidity. (After inflation, you are losing money by investing in bonds). And trying to pick stocks yourself can really hurt you over time. Don't get me wrong, I personally have a ""play account"" that I invest in stocks for ""fun"" just to see if I can pick some winners, but I view this much like I view playing ""scratch-offs"" at the gas station. It is money I am willing to lose.  

There is a lot more I would like to explain, but I am tired of typing. Feel free to ask me questions. I just wanted to share my humble opinions and thoughts. 


EDIT: You guys have a lot of questions, please browse the comments to make sure they aren't already answered. I am not saying my way is the best, it is just a way I have found to be very successful and I have found people in my field who do it this way and have for a long time. (Minus the not investing in bonds, they don't now, but did in the past when you actually had decent returns) 

EDIT 2: The only time I invest in bonds is if I know/think I will need the money in the short term. It isn't a driving tool in my portfolios though.

EDIT 3: I know some of you love stock trading, and a lot of you do it for a living. But the average person does not have the extensive knowledge you have about trading. This info is just generic guidelines for the average hard working person that wants to save for retirement.  I love stock trading just as much as you guys, but I don't use it to drive my retirement account. 

EDIT 4: Remember, everyone has a different method of investing, I just thought I would share mine. Everyone finds success in different ways, and this is how I have achieved success. Not the right way, or wrong way, just a way.

Horray! Then I realized most of it was luck, and it easily could have gone the other way. I was essentially a weekly trader for a bit of that period- pretty immature of me given my lack of expertise. I learned this early on in the year, and slowed down on my 'trading' and went back to the original plan of 'investing' in a few companies for a longer term (purchasing stock and let it grow for about 2-4 years).

Here's a timeline of what happened: [graph](http://i.imgur.com/o3v1Y.png). I made my $1,700 (mostly off the one stock shown) and then ended up purchasing quite a bit more stock spread over the three companies I was interested in. The graph makes it look like I only purchased one company on the last purchase, but it's spread evenly over three and they all have very similar charts given they're in the same industry.

So basically, if I were to sell now, I'd lose about $3,000 on the trade. No big deal, I didn't invest (read: gamble) with money that I couldn't stand to lose. However, my CPA said that if the price doesn't go back up at the end of next year, that I should sell my stock for a ~$3k loss sometime in December. Then if I wait 2 months, I can repurchase that stock and still claim it as some sort of loss, essentially giving me a tax break. So if by some chance the stock doesn't rise or fall too much in that 2 month span, I can repurchase it for the same price and continue to invest for another 2-4 years. Is this a common tactic? It sounds like it's cheating. Also to note: he said to keep the stock for at least 1 year before selling for tax purposes. I didn't do this for my initial trades, but by the time next December rolls around, I'll have had all of my current positions for well over 1 year so I should be good there.

Of course, with my case, if the stock stays volatile then it definitely might be a dumb idea to try out. Knowing my luck, which is always bad luck, the stock would sky-rocket right after I sold it. Which is why my CPA said to call and talk to him before I do anything stupid.

So, any thoughts on this tactic? I already learned my lesson in trading, and I now know that trading is not necessarily investing, but you can feel free to lecture me all you want anyway. I definitely deserve the lecture after my last year.

I am the executive manager of a wholesale liquor store (~$22mil in revenue per year) and the way beer is moving in terms of the little guys is pretty interesting. I bought BREW, which is a small group of craft breweries, at $7.69 a few weeks ago and it hit its 52wk high today at $9.25. Widmer Brothers which is a part of it has the hottest selling gluten free beers in the market at the moment. The way Sam Adams is moving right is a little worrisome to me because they are continually releasing new products that are just sitting on the shelves and not moving, Angry Orchard is killing it right now though. It pretty much saved their most recent quarter. 

Some people were asking about BUD and Groupo Modelo, I am no expert but our local markets have seen upward trends lately. In 2010 Corona sales were at their lowest for not just our location but almost all distributors. However, we are on pace for our best year on Corona, Modelo, Heineken, and Bud since 2009. Up almost 15,000 cases from last year. 

Just some thoughts.

EDIT: This has garnered more attention than I guess I thought it would. The store I operate is the #1 Corona/Modelo account in the SE United States and is a top account for many Liquor brands. If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask away.

There was an article on Zerohedge yesterday on High Frequency Trading (HFT). You can read the complete post here 
 
Please click the images for larger sizes (Images credit – Zerohedge / Nanex). 
 
Summary of key points
 
- Yesterday’s ISM numbers were supposed to be released at 10 am ET
 
- Some HFT firms apparently got the information 15 milliseconds earlier and executed large orders on the SPY (at 9:59:59.985 am)
 
- Similar activity can be noticed on the ES futures 8 milliseconds prior to 10 am (9:59:59.992 am)
 
- Why the difference in 7 milliseconds ? The ISM number is released in NYC, and the E-minis are traded in Chicago. That’s how long it takes (7 milliseconds – speed of light to travel from NYC to Chicago) for the data to travel from NYC to Chicago. 
 
My question is – does this kind of trading affect average people at all ? Let these guys spend a gazillion dollars on superfast computers and fight for first place in a race that’s entirely between themselves. Average investors are not fighting for this edge. I’m not an expert on HFT, but it seems like this fight is completely HFT vs HFT, much like big-city rival gangs. Or am i missing something ? Please weigh in if you are knowledgeable in this area. 
 
Regardless, it’s a fascinating look at how High frequency trading works in the markets. The article seems to suggest that there could be hanky-panky involved in the fact that this data was available to certain players ahead of time. Yes, this is definitely a problem if it is true. But whose clocks are they going by ? What’s to say that the data itself was not released 15 milliseconds earlier than 10 am sharp  . I’m just amazed to see that transactions are being recorded and documented at the millisecond level. Both charts below show SPY and ES trading volumes at the millisecond level for different exchanges. Check out these awesome charts..Both charts show volume in a span of 150 milliseconds, which is just 15% of 1 second.

I've noticed most of what I've read about investing is about analyzing what and when to make a purchase, and it seems like there is not as much information about when you should sell. I have a particular example that I can hopefully use to learn from.

I purchased stock in Windstream (WIN) two times, averaging a value of around $10 a share. The first purchase (note that it was my first stock purchase ever) was under the flawed logic of ""well I don't really care about the volatility of the stock if it has that high of a dividend (around 10%). I'll just hold it long term and everything will be cool."" Obviously naive considering the high dividend percentage and not researching the sustainability of said dividend. Well the stock tanked once to around 9.00 a share and I bought some more to even out the average cost per share to $10.

Now, if you didn't already know, there is concern of them not being able to pay their dividend, so the price dropped yet again. My question now is what to do. On one hand, the loss has already been made due to speculation, so I might as well hold on to it at this point. But on the other hand, if it does come to pass that they cannot pay the dividend, my guess is that the stock price will drop even more, resulting in more loss. Any flaws in my current logic?

Since they're announcing earnings soon, I thought it'd be relevant to share and maybe have some discussion about it.

Personally I think that they will succeed in the longrun and beat Detroit at their own game. Not only do they cater to the electrical aspect, but they're also just great cars. They've had no problem filling reservations and having consumers put down $5,000 deposits. They're also selling directly to the consumer which I think is a huge shift in how we buy cars. The price is the price, there is no more haggling. The only real issue I see Tesla having is infrastructure. The superchargers are awesome (free renewable energy) but there's an issue there with how can Tesla put them everywhere they need to be all on their own. I'd love to see gas stations and convenience stores putting in EV chargers and just charging for the energy. Of course they can charge a premium on top of the actual cost, for the convenience and location of the charger, but even then it is still cheaper than gas. If Tesla is going to face any major issue it will be the lack of infrastructure and overcoming the perception that people need that instant satisfaction of charging on long trips.

Excellent article linked in thread.",70,19,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/16xzds/a_simple_moving_average_when_applied_to/,"http://www.fa-mag.com/news/-re-discovering-technical-analysis-12693.html

Article highlights the benefits of how using simple technical analysis tools can be used to outperform buy and hold strategies, minimize the potential for deep losses that strike buy and hold portfolios and provide better entry and exit points without emotional decisions or endorsement of trading as opposed to investing.

""Consider a simple strategy benchmark with an initial weighting of 60% stocks (represented by the S&amp;P 500) and 40% bonds (by the Barclays Aggregate Bond index). Buying and holding this mix earned you an annualized total return of 7.7% for the 20 years through August 2012 while it gave you an annualized volatility (standard deviation) of roughly 10.7. By contrast, your performance would have considerably improved with a market-timing strategy that adjusted the same initially weighted allocation using signals from a simple 10-month moving average (roughly the equivalent of a 200-day average). You would have seen a return of 9.3% a year and volatility of 7.9. Here’s how the moving average strategy in Figure 1 works: When the equity index falls under its 10-month moving average (based on monthly data) at any month’s end, the entire stock allocation is moved to cash (three-month T-bills). There it stays until the equity index closes above its 10-month average, at which point all the cash is shifted back to stocks. The same rule applies to bonds. In short, the equity portion of the portfolio is either in stocks or cash, and the remaining fixed-income allocation is either in bonds or cash. The result is that this moving average strategy would have sidestepped the worst of the corrections and crashes. If that sounds familiar, it’s because similar results have been documented in numerous studies through the years.""

We can stem the lazy posts by having some form of suggestion of something for popular stocks to get analyzed by those of us (maybe occasionally institutional players on this subreddit who are willing to) who might have more experience and insight.

I want to thank you all for the great suggestions and comments in the recent thread discussing the direction and future of r/investing.

This sub has grown rapidly over the past two years, and as many of you rightly suggested, we need to change with the times and evolve with our growing numbers!

Change is always good!

With that said, let me address some of the more popular issues that were mentioned:

The top comment was:

&gt;A blanket ban on zero-content posts of the format, ""What do you think about TIKR?"" 

Many of you suggested these get deleted right away due to lack of content and that the OP should do their own research.

User alphadoodledoo suggested:

&gt;There's a rule over at /r/wine that you can't post a bottle pic unless you include tasting notes.

MightyDerek says:

&gt;This NEEDS to be implemented. It bugs me when people don't even do some basic research before asking for others to do the work for them.

I strongly disagree. If OP is asking such a question, odds are he/she has no idea how to even do research. OP came here for suggestions and feedback, not to be told that he must go look at the PE and somehow magically conclude that research has been done.

If you go onto r/cars and ask if the Mustang is a good car, do they tell you to go do your own research? 

People come here for opinions and help!

If somebody asks a question about PFE and you happened to be a long term PFE shareholder that is very familiar with the stock, do you consider it ""work"" by telling the OP what you know?

People in r/cars will be more than happy to share their experiences with the mustang with you, they do not consider it ""work"", nor will they tell you that you must post your own research before you can ask a question. Neither should we!


Next up:

**Suggestion: Delete posts on popular stocks eg ""Is TSLA a good stock?""**

As timing would have it, we actually have a current post right now on that exact topic:

(http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jsia3/telsa_tsla_as_a_long_term_stock)[Is TSLA a good long term stock?]

I believe it is wrong to delete posts that are generating a lot of discussion, this goes against the entire purpose of Reddit! We want to encourage and promote active discussions, not remove them!

My opinion on the matter is that if you do not want to read the TSLA topic again, do not click on it, move onto something that may interest you. Popular stocks will always generate a lot of conversation, just because you were early on the subject does not mean everybody else  was too.

Some good solutions mentioned were to create a weekly thread to funnel these types of discussions, so for example: ""TSLA thread for week of Aug 5th"" could be the catch thread for the topic. If not a weekly thread, perhaps a monthly thread.


**Tell people asking finance questions to go to r/personalfinance**

No!

If you ran Bob's Burgers and a customer came in asking if he could have some fries, would you send them down the street to the place that sells fries?

This is r/investing, we overlap a lot of different topics and have many very knowledgeable investors right here!

Telling every finance question to go to r/personalfinance, then telling every real estate question to go to r/realestate, then telling every mutual fund question to go to r/bogleheads, then telling every technical analysis question to go to r/stockmarket... Well, pretty soon this place would be a ghost town.

We have very smart people right here that can answer every single investing related question, let them!

r/ELI5 did not grow into the giant it has become because they told every magnet question to go to r/science, they answered everything thrown at them!

To address this issue, I like this idea by user ""nows"":

&gt;Require [tagging] in titles – examples [Equity], [Portfolio], [Real Estate], [Speculative], [FSA], [TA], etc.

Capital: $10,000 (plus $500 every month)

Desired yearly returns: ~8-10%

I know that I'm not going to beat the market and I know that I have a long time to make up any money that I do lose given my age.

I'm willing to invest in ""the market"" or an ""ETF"" or a ""mutual fund"" but I keep reading and I don't know what it is that I should be putting my money into.

I have a Scottrade account but I'd be more than happy to open a Vanguard account. I am more than overwhelmed looking at their screener, so I come to r/investing for advice. I'm tired of looking at year-to-date returns of things I know nothing about.

Should I just throw 100% of my funds into NYSE:SPY and shut the fuck up? Or do I need to balance it out with some sort of bond and international market ETF? This is where the confusion arises. Why not NYSE:SDY? Who knows? Please help.

I've been throwing my money into NYSE:SFL because it pays a ~9% dividend and I've been doing pretty well.

1354145569.0,48,self.investing,13yn9c,"Smoke if you got em, Why you should own PM and BTI",76,28,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13yn9c/smoke_if_you_got_em_why_you_should_own_pm_and_bti/,"There have been some interest and opinions voiced on the subject of international tobacco companies. I figured since I am relatively familiar with the space I would give my thoughts.

First, a personal disclosure. I do work in the investment management industry and have completed all three levels of the CFA examination after obtaining my bachelor’s degree in finance. I also own a large percentage of my personal net worth in PM and BATS-LON, so I do have skin in the game so to speak. Now onto the fun stuff….

The international tobacco market is dominated by four firms: Philip Morris International (PM), British American Tobacco (BATS-LON or the ADR is BTI), Japanese Tobacco (JPN 2914) and Imperial Tobacco (IMT-LON). Together, these firms control roughly 70% of the market share for cigarettes and tobacco products sold outside of the US and China. Investors exclude these two countries in the analysis because most international players have no US exposure since domestic companies like MO, RAI and LO dominate that market and the Chinese tobacco market is a monopoly with a state owned firm having 99% market share. This high market share shows how consolidated the market for tobacco is abroad. This gives companies like PM and BTI large pricing power to customers and suppliers giving PM and BTI large profit margins. EBIT margins for 2011 were as follows: PM 43.2%, BTI 27.7%, Japan Tobacco 21.2%, IMT 18.4%. PM and BTI have some of the largest ratios because they have the best brands, the best production facilities and largest sales bases allowing for fixed cost leverage.

**Volumes:** Most of the investment community is concerned about the volume outlook for cigarettes. Cigarettes are very unhealthy and prolonged use of these products will no doubt increase a user’s risk of cancer and other very serious health issues. As such, volumes in the US and other developed markets have been falling at roughly 1%+ per year as usage drops. However, this is where PM and BTI shine compared to their US peers. Because PM and BTI have Emerging Market (EM) exposure, where volumes are flat to even growing in some cases, overall volumes for most international players are actually flat to falling slightly. For PM and BTI, overall volumes are likely to be flat to down -0.5% per year for the medium to long term. PM and BTI offer a superior EM profile as compared to Japan Tobacco and Imperial so I tend to focus on them more.

**Pricing:** The real kicker for cigarette companies is that because nicotine is addictive, demand for tobacco is very inelastic; large increases in pricing are offset by much smaller decreases in volumes. The typical algorithm for revenue growth is roughly -1% to 0% volume growth plus 4-5% annual pricing suggesting long term revenue growth of 3-5% per year. This is hugely beneficial for tobacco firms because they can rationalize production quickly to offset lower volumes. This constant pricing and active restructuring of the cost base insures rising revenues will drive solid EBIT growth.

**Taxes:** Many people in the investment community argue that increased regulation and taxes from the government will hurt long term volumes. While volumes may indeed get hit by new regulations, investors (me included) should be glad when these actions occur. First, rising tax increases give tobacco companies cover to bump up pricing on the back of those price increases. Because the amount per pack going to the company is small relative to the tax, large % gains on the pack going towards the companies are very small in relation the nominal cost of the pack. With regards to stricter regulations, this also benefits current competitors as it raises the cost of doing business preventing new entrants from entering the market. Less competition is a boon for pricing and margins. When was the last time you saw a start up cigarette producer in the US?

**Profitability and return of capital:** Any investment that I look at (and I strongly recommend that ALL your investments follow this regardless of what they are) is simply the present value of all cash you expect to be returned to you at some discount rate appropriate for its risk and market conditions/returns on other investments. Investments are simply cash outlays with the idea of more cash inflows later on.
Tobacco companies have offered substantial historical returns because of their ability to generate substantial Free Cash Flow and then return that cash back to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. These two levers have been so strong for Tobacco companies because they have rationalized what they reinvest in the business. New sales require additional capital, usually in the form of a new factory, new inventory, etc. Because Free Cash Flow is equal to Operating Cash Flow less Capital Expenditures, not needing to spend a lot on capital expenditures yet still able to grow EBIT is hard to do. But Tobacco companies do it well mostly because of the factors listed above (pricing, volume, taxes, etc.)

Additionally, tobacco companies generate high ROIC or Return on Invested Capital. Roughly, it shows for all factors of capital invested in the business (net working capital, PPE, intangible assets, cash, etc) how much the firm earns on that. A firm is said to earn Economic Value when ROIC is above the company’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital or WACC. Tobacco companies enjoy an intoxicating mix of a high ROIC business that requires very little capital to grow the business, with the excess capital generated being returned to shareholders. This is as close to the holy grail of investing as one could get (if only it didn’t kill.)

**But couldn’t plain packaging kill the business??:** People are really concerned about Australia’s plain packaging law and rightfully so. Essentially, no more red Marlboro packs for PM in Aussieland. This threat is overdone. Australian is one of the smallest tobacco markets and one of the most progressive when it comes to smoking laws. Companies like PM and BTI, which are roughly 50-60% exposed to EMs, have little exposure to regulations in developed countries. Growth in the EM business for PM and BTI will more than offset any issues in Developed Markets.

Emerging Markets are the story for PM and BTI. India, Indonesia, Russia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Turkey, the Middle East and Africa are all huge opportunities for these firms as incomes are rising and smoking rates are high and sometimes even going up. The size of these markets is substantial. India is 10% of the world’s smoking population and Indonesia is roughly 5%, as is Russia. As comparison, the US has 5% of the world’s smokers.

**China, the Wild Card:** Because tobacco is such a great business, governments have naturally tended to own it in their own country. In fact, many of the early in roads to EM tobacco companies have been joint ventures with state owned firms. China is no different, with 99% of the market owned by the state monopoly firm and 1% being licensed out to PM and BTI (they provide packaging but the State owned firm does the production and selling). China is a massive market for cigarettes with roughly 300MM male smokers (population of the US) and 30% of the world’s smoking population. With smoking prevalence rates flat and incomes rising, PM and BTI would love to get into that market to premiumize and consolidate it. This is a huge opportunity that I think could happen in our lifetime as China has a recent record of spinning off once state owned industries and letting private companies in. 

**Valuation:** Using a DCF with a 10% discount rate and 2.5% terminal EBIT growth rate, I think PM is worth roughly $100-105 per share and BATS-LON is worth between GBP 3750 - GBP 3850 per share. The conversion to the ADR (which is worth 2 shares) gives a FV of between $115-120 for the ADR (ticker symbol is BTI).

I would look to buy these on pullbacks, specifically at 15-20% discounts to FV. That would be $85 for PM and $100 for BTI. 
Right now I prefer BTI as they have better EM exposure, better opportunities to rationalize the cost base and it is cheaper vs. PM. But if you are an US investor, it may be best to hedge the USD/GBP exchange rate since BTI is traded in GBP. I don’t for my holdings but that is a different discussion entirely!

I hope you enjoyed my write-up and if you have any questions, feel free to PM me.

Also, I don’t smoke and I don’t think you should either!

- Level 0. Made plenty of stupid mistakes: pennies, bankrupt-prone companies.  
- Level 1. I moved to value investing with long-term holds with some success.  
- Level 2. Took some finance courses in options. Traded spreads for a few years.
- Level 3. Selling puts and calls on mix of value, growth, and blue-chips.

* managing tax-obligations

Is it worth use better corporate structuring to handle the trading account?  

* dealing with IRS

Purchased my first home about five years ago.  Paid $370,000.  Current comps show it may be worth $230,000 on today's market.  Put down 20% on a 30 year fixed mortgage.  No liar loans here.  

I'm in my mid-fifties and not in the best of health.  I'd like to make the right move for my wife and family.  

I don't have to move, I don't have to sell, but I'm confident I won't see this house ever approach what we paid for it.

Obviously we need a place to live so I could buy another house, but what to do with this albatross?

Short sale?  I know I'd need bank approval but what's the process and how much of an additional dollar hit would I take?  

What's the smart play here (I've obviously already made the dumb one.)

I'm in NJ having relocated from NYC for work.  

FWIW, I hate the house and only bought it because my wife and I were exhausted by the hunt and could not look at another one without dry heaving.  And this hate has nothing to do with the current value -- although it doesn't help.

Essentially, she writes insurance contracts on the major stock indexes WAY out of the money (almost 20% away from current prices and ranging up to 8 weeks in duration) in size and collects the premium.

More importantly, gold and silver are still historically over-valued by about 4 fold, had their blow-off tops in July/August of last year and have made two lower highs and lower lows since then.

Normally, yield curves ALWAYS invert before recessions.  This, of course, is not the same as saying that every inverted yield curve predicts a recession.  Over the past several decades, it has been a requirement for a recession, but not a predictor.  The yield curve is not inverted today.  Normally, that means we have no fear of a recession ahead (Despite the fact we had that 0.1% growth in Q42012).  
 
But my question is this:  Does QE make the inverted yield curve rule obsolete?  I was reading a paper on the effects of QE on the yield curve and they seemed unsure of its effects on the entire spectrum of the curve.  They had some conflicting evidence.  I'm not sure what to think.  So I thought I'd throw the question out to you guys.  Any thoughts?  Papers or articles discussing the merits of inverted yield curves in the modern QE economy?

“I bought my first stock, you know, when— when the United States was losing the war, right after Pearl Harbor. I didn't buy it because I thought losing the war was a great idea, I bought it because I thought stocks were cheap and that eventually we'd win the war.”  

“I like owning stocks. I do not like owning bonds now. There could be conditions under which we would own bonds. But— they're conditions far different than what exist now.”  

“You shouldn't be 40% in bonds. I would have them having enough cash on hand so they feel comfortable, and then the rest in equities.  I would have productive assets. I would favor those enormously over fixed dollars investments now, and I think it's silly— to have some ratio like 30 or 40 or 50% in bonds. They're terrible investments now.” 

“I bought bonds back in the early '80s. We bought— we made a lot of money and we bought zero coupon bonds that— I bought 'em personally. And— no, it— it— the price of everything determines its attractiveness. 
And— the price of stocks was way down a few years ago. The news was terrible, but the stocks were cheap, you know. News is better now. Stocks are higher. They're still not— they're not ridiculously high at all, and bonds are priced artificially. You've got some guy buying $85 billion a month. (LAUGH) And— that will change at some point. And when it changes, people could lose a lot of money if they're in long-term bonds.” 

“Chasing yield— is— is crazy. You know, just because you'd like to earn eight percent, (LAUGH) or— or— or you'd like to earn ten percent or you'd like to earn six percent. The world isn't going to adapt to that. You— you have to think about what is the most intelligent thing to do and if— if that produces five p— percent or six percent, that's the best you're going to do. 
But to— to get enticed into some investment that— is riskier that you don't understand because somebody promises you a higher yield— I mean, I can— you know, I can take it down to the waterfront or something like that and they'll promise you 15 percent or something. (LAUGH) And it just doesn't make any sense at all. And— but, pension funds— you know, they— they haven't been that well managed over time.” 
 
“AIG got in trouble basically 'cause— in terms of the derivative position they had. And I think they're changing the rules on derivatives. If the rules in terms of collateral and so on had been what they're going to be— it would've been a somewhat different struggle. It was— it was a very recklessly-managed institution.”

Or, if you're an investor, buying stocks is a way to directly contribute to a company/idea that you believe in, and then to watch it grow.

Right now, I see it as a huge game of speculation. Sure, there are lots of methods for technical analysis and the like, but ultimately it boils down to that.

The net result is a portfolio that has magically underperformed everything.  The train wrecks in my portfolio include MS, PBW, ARO, LDK (sold out completely @ around $4 a share), MU.  I even attempted option trades as a way to better manage risk.  It's only made things worse.

I've tried shorting the market only for it to rally hard.  Tried catching a rally only to have it tank equally as hard.  I'm not going to call it rigged, I'm not that dumb, but at this point it certainly feels like I'm perpetually paddling against the current in a raging river.

So that all being said, what would you do with an anemic portfolio?  Close up shop and convert everything to a a mix of a few high profile index funds like SPY, HDGE, IJR, IWM and TLT?  Should I just hold it out a little while longer with some of the stocks I am long in and hope for the best?  Should I just drop out of active trading and let the stocks I have invested in do their thing?

Really lost on which one regarding fees and which one that fits me,52,9,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1i45aw/online_stock_brokers_really_lost_on_which_one/,"I want to apologize first. I know there has been several other reddit post regarding the same topic. I've read them all and I'm still just unsure of which online stock broker should I sign up for that fits me.

Im very new to this stock/investing idea. What got me started was the thought that there's so many hours in my life that I can work. I want to spend some time having my money work for me (long term and short term investments. I'm already 26. I have about 2k at the moment ready to put into this. Im also up for taking a percentage out of my pay biweekly to put in to stocks/investments.
What I want to do

* Buy long term investments

~~* Buy maybe one or two penny stocks ( not going to heavy invest in penny stocks from my understanding they are very dangerous.)~~

~~* Buy 3d printing stocks for some long term investments~~

~~* Buy stocks in intel, amd, microsoft, and etc~~


Im unsure which online broker would fit me. The ability to check on mobile would be a nice option to have as well. I've looked at TD ameritrade, sharebuilder,suretrader, scott trade, tradeking, and optionhouse. Im just worried about hidden fees or extra fees when buying ETF, penny stocks, and fees for transfer/closing the account.

I know that sharebuilder as well have a great auto investment option that charges a small amount every month. I read that costco has a partnership with sharebuilders and if i open a membership with costco i get a reduce trading fee with sharebuilder. 

so far many peoples advice is for me to buy etf index funds since im new to this.

thank you fapfaplulz,wtbreach,jewcebox95 for helping me on the other posts. I had to delete the other post and repost it here instead of the other subreddit because someone recommended this subreddit instead.

**Im also very new to all of this ..don't think i mentioned it before**

**Edit update 4 7/15/13 9:32 am est**
Going to open a vanguard account and fund the roth ira to the max. Planning to open a 403b with tiaa-cref from my work and fund it as much as i can but not as much as my roth ira. My employer does not match my contributions. I will be buying target date funds 2050 for both. During this time i will be trying to learn about investments before anything else

thank you all for helping me getting started in this. 

**edit update 3 7/12/13 8:32pm est**

The plan atm is to open a Vanguard account  with 3,000 and fund my ROTH IRA,vanguard etf and open another account with TD ameritrade for other etf and etc.  What are some good etf i should buy with vanguard?

**edit update2**

thank you guys for helping me out so much. all of your advice and comments saved me from losing alot of my money. I see the mistakes i alreayd made. I should not be looking at buying individual stocks atm. I should be buying etf index funds and starting on my roth. I should start building my portfolio first. 

it looks like Fidelity or td ameritrade is good place to open an account for etf and long term investments. for stocks either scottrade,tradeking, and etc. I still have lots to learn


**edit update1**


* so it seems like td ameritrade is good for their software and detailed charts/etc. Having no trade done 

* scottrade seems to be in a good middle ground with me opening another account 

* ~~anyone know how are taxes done? some people are telling me that i will get charged about 30 dollar per 100 dollar stock? true? Im in a part time job / part time student ~15k yr from work I took a semester off though~~ [answered!](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1i45aw/online_stock_brokers_really_lost_on_which_one/cb0vfjc)

* Fidelity seems like a good place to open a roth and start a investment

* Good place to buy etf would be td-ameritrade or fidelity ""commission free"". 

* Maybe good for me to open a fidelity account for Roth, and etf? Then Tradeking/IB for stock trading

http://www.bloomberg.com/video/79124654/


Upon the successful launch of the Model S Tesla is looking at 25% profit margins which is considered very high compared to other car manufacturers.

http://www.wemotor.com/blog/2011/01/tesla-to-see-better-profit-margins-thanks-to-cheaper-batteries/

On top of that the bass Tesla built for the Model S allows them to build new cars such as the Model X SUV and get them into production very quickly.


2) Elon Musk (CEO of Tesla) is a modern day Tony Stark:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk

""Elon Musk (born June 28, 1971) is an South African engineer and entrepreneur best known for co-founding PayPal, SpaceX and Tesla Motors. He is currently the CEO and CTO of SpaceX, CEO and Product Architect ofTesla Motors and Chairman of SolarCity. Musk is best known for having created the first viable production electric car of the modern era (Tesla Roadster), for designing a private successor to the Space Shuttle (F9/Dragon) and creating the world's largest Internet payment system (PayPal).


3) Most electric vehicles manufacturer's such as Toyota and Ford are using Tesla's Powertrain design in their electric vehicles:

http://www.treehugger.com/cars/toyota-rav4-ev-with-tesla-powertrain-coming-to-the-us-in-2012.html

This means that for almost every electric vehicle sold Tesla makes money even if it's not a Tesla


4) Tesla is the Apple of Autos:

http://www.earthtechling.com/2011/06/new-mit-battery-will-rock-evs-energy-storage/

With any new technology early adopters usually get punished a little bit. Buyers of the iPad 1 got burned when the iPad 2 was released and many people upgraded to the better iPad 2. This pattern repeats itself through history. But with every new generation of product the technology gets better as well as the price. With time Tesla will develop electric vehicles with much better battery life than the cars they are launching now. A 500 or 600 mile battery doesn't seem out of the question in the next 5 years.
In short Elon Musk next to Zuckerberg are probably the best CEO's to come to Silicon Valley since Steve Jobs

http://www.solarfeeds.com/analyst-calls-tesla-the-apple-of-autos-tsla-aapl/


5) Let's face it buying Green makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside:
Going green seems to be the way of the future and buying a Tesla produces 0% emissions and causes 0 harmful effects on the environment if you power your Tesla on Solar Panels.

Nothing I need, just something fun.  But I could also put it in my brokerage account, which has 100 free trades a year, and buy 1 share of Nordstrom for $50.  Or a share of EA games instead of the video game.  
  
  If I want the watch, I can find a few reviews on the watch, go to the store, try it on and figure out if I like it.  A relatively low investment on time, for something that is kind of cool and fun for me.  But if I want to buy $50 in stock...  well that's going to be a relatively high investment in time, at least doing what I know. 
  
  I'm curious what people think about this.  Is there a disconnect between dropping $50-$100 on a consumer disposable (heck, you could drop $100 on a nice dinner with no thought) and spending $100 to buy some shares of a company you like?  At which point does it change from ""this company is cool, I'll just buy some stock"" to ""I need to estimate the 5 year growth, find a terminal multiple, calculate the WACC to estimate the discount rate and determine my potential return on investment""?  
  
   Like I said, this is more of a philosophical question than a how do I invest question.  What is the equivilant of reading reviews on Yelp or Amazon and just going for it?  Listening to the opinions of a financial analyst?  ugh...   :-) 
  
  Thoughts?  
  
  
  *edit: okay, there's a ton of interesting stuff here.  One thought that comes to mind, and sticking with the watch analogy: If I dress like shit, and I already have a watch that works fine, buying a new $50 watch is not likely to make a huge difference in my life.  A bad-ass watch will not overcome people thinking I dress like ass overall.  Likewise, dropping $50 on stock is not going to make a big difference in my financial well being (throwawaystress), especially if I have a ton of debt (thomasj222444). 
  
  Where it starts to make a difference is when you become more dedicated to a goal.  If you're trying to dress better, you might start trying on more clothes, and finding good stores to shop at.  You might start reading more reviews of different clothes you like.  Maybe you buy a few different watches to serve different purposes (sorry for the clothing references, I've been spending too much time over at MFA).  And hopefully when you're buying your clothes you're waiting for sales (as suggested by AnalyticContinuation). Now, doing all of this *is* going to take a bit of time to do.  A lot more time to research and purchase than any one item.  But it's also going to make a big difference in how you look.  Likewise, if you're going to be in the market, you're going to need to spend some time doing your research.  Building a decent portfolio is going to take time, just like building a decent wardrobe of well fitting clothes would take some time.  
  
  So overall, a marginal amount of money put *anywhere* is not going to make a big difference in your life.  But focus and persistence will make a difference.  
 
I feel like I've hit my own little Epiphany.

A while back, r/investing was overrun by spammers, and I think it might happen again with StockJock-e at the helm. 

StockJock-e has created a sub-reddit dedicated to the promotion of his penny stock forum and refers to it frequently in his posts on r/investing (his sub-reddit is r/thestockmarket, his penny stock forum is hotstockmarket.com).  With his mod power, there's no telling what he'll eventually turn r/investing into. 

r/investing is an important sub-reddit to defend because this is the first place redditors go to get investing related advice.  I truly believe StockJock-e should be removed from the mod team before he is able to overrun this place with spam like his sub-reddit r/thestockmarket.  

Also, to any beginners that believe that StockJock-e's posts contain any valuable information, after a while, you'll realize he likes to use a lot of fancy buzz words to appears smarter than he is.  Coming from someone who knows a lot about how the stock market works, I can tell you with a straight face that StockJock-e is all talk.  It's comforting to get answers from someone on such a mysterious thing as the stock market, but I can assure you his answers and explanations are pure drivel.  I'm not attacking TA, but his implementation and explanations of TA are very unsound.  

Anyway, I'm done with my rant, I hope I'm not the only redditor that is concerned about this.  

**This is a response to unforgyvn's request for more information about my claims:**

StockJock-e has been wrong on many occasions, and sometimes spectacularly wrong.  One example of this is the post where he stated how obvious a bearish move in the S&amp;P would be only to have the index rally for 5 straight days in a row.  For him to believe that a move in the stock market is *obvious* is bad enough, I really don’t have a problem when he’s wrong (no one can be right all of the time), it's the way he tries to explain his incorrect predictions.  

When StockJock-e is wrong there are several things he does to make it seem like he's not really at fault. The first thing is he just refers to his disclaimer about how unwise it is to listen to people on the internet about stocks.  So basically, if he's right, he's a smart guy, if he's wrong, you're a not a smart guy for listening to him.  This is just one way he protects himself, but there's more.  

He has in the past explained his incorrect predictions by saying that a short squeeze in the markets was what caused him to be incorrect.  Even if there were enough short term speculators to actually move the S&amp;P with a short squeeze, how would StockJock-e have the transaction data from every market participant to say whether a short term rally was indeed caused by a short squeeze.  There are more than just speculators out there.  Large institutions participate in the markets to both hedge their exposures, and realize arbitrage profit.  If the market consisted only of short term speculators, this would be a more likely possibility, but again, StockJock-e has no way of really backing up this claim with any hard numbers or data.  This is an example of using fancy buzzwords to hide mistakes and replace real analysis.  

Next, in the past, if the market moves against him, he'll cite CNBC bringing out the bulls if he's bearish, or the bears if he's bullish.  It's not his fault that he's wrong, but CNBC's.  It is simply untrue that CNBC decides where the market moves, they merely report on what's happening.  This is another example of how StockJock-e will pretend to have some special inside understanding of the stock market when he's really just trying to hide his mistakes with mumbo-jumbo.  

Even if StockJock-e is wrong sometimes, and even if he's unable to properly explain why he's wrong, it shouldn't matter if he's able to consistently make money from the stock market, right?  Now, this is just my own guessing, but if it were easy for StockJock-e to make money on stocks, I don't see why he would be promoting his money making site on reddit.  If the majority of the people here support StockJock-e, that’s fine I really can’t control what you believe as good or bad, but I really think there are real problems with his motivations and the content of his posts.

I've been meaning to write this for a long time, I think it's important to at least be aware of this problem.  

**A Summary of the problem:** Website publishers get paid by certain stock brokers for every new account sign up they bring in.  This is called ""Affiliate Marketing"" and has a negative effect on stock broker recommendations that are published online.  Because there is a financial incentive for website publishers to recommend brokers that pay them, website publishers will use misleading tactics to increase the amount of money they make. 

**How this affects you:** If you're just starting out, you may know of a handful of stock brokers, and turn to Google to research further.   When you search on Google (or any other search site) you will find websites that misleadingly promote stock brokers that pay them.  How does this affect you?  If you're a casual investor, this won't hurt you much.  Most brokers do an OK job, and you'll end up with an OK broker.  This is fine and well, but if you really want to find a broker that will best suit your investing needs, turning to Google will result in recommendations for the same handful of brokers that pay website publishers to promote them.  

**Telling the difference between actual recommendations and advertising:**
Luckily, website publishers promote brokers that pay them don't do a particularly good job of hiding it.  Look for these tall tale signs:

* No First Had Experience From The Writer: Many website publishers that promote brokers that pay them don't even use the brokers themselves.  If there is no first-hand information given about the user experience, this is a clear indication that a recommendation is being paid for.  It wouldn't make much sense for someone to recommend something they never tried, without being paid for it.  

* Advertising related variables in URL: If you see a recommendation for a stock broker, and click through to the website, look for advertising related variables in the URL.  Below is what such a URL may look like:

https://www.aBrokerIwontName.com/c/search2.aspx?campaign=Aff-CJ-Banner2&amp;promo=search2

Notice the words ""campaign"", ""promo"", ""Aff"" (affiliate), ""CJ"" (Commission Junction, a large affiliate marketing company).  These are red flags that the link you clicked through is paid for.  

* The same brokers will show up time and time again: Take a look at the following screen shot of affiliate offers for online stock brokers and a broker recommendation article (http://i.imgur.com/g1S9b.jpg ).  What you may notice is that these same brokers will show up in countless stock broker recommendations on the internet.  The most blatant and misleading tactic is when only these stock brokers are put into a ""Top 10"" list, which maximizes the payout for the website publisher and falsely portrays a list of brokers that pay website publishers as being a list of the best brokers.

Graphene is set to replace other materials in a wide range of fields, adding to that also new technologies based om graphene. 
This is already getting big with several companies gone public.

So one company that caught my eye is Focus Graphite and their subsidiary Graphoid. Focus Graphite owns a large high quality graphite mine that looks set to bring in money regardless.

Graphoid is focusing on mass production technology of graphene for industry. 

I'm a novice trader and I have only some limited experience with CD trading. I have about 4300 USD to invest and am basically looking to leverage a bet as high as possible on this one [stock](https://www.google.com/finance?q=OTCMKTS%3AFCSMF&amp;ei=t8a1UdHYO-n6wAOHlAE). 

I've been looking at Scott trade but I cant figure out their margins and I'm also not sure if this being a  ""penny stock"" affects affects my fees?

I new to brokers so in regards to stop loss, are there scenarios where I might not be able to dump the stock?

Sorry if its a little jumbled. Input appreciated.

edit: I should mention that I'm not worried about loosing the money, only about incurring debt with the broker while trading on a margin.

edit 2: This being a penny stock was coincidental, what I wanted to do was to do a leveraged swing trade at 20% margin. With good stop loss I don't see that as being overly risky?

I would no longer buy Humana as it is too expensive to start a position. However this is not to say that I think the company is highly overvalued / overbought. In fact I think it may even have room to move higher. 

My question is, given the small size of the position, should I sell all my shares for an ~18% gain?

Lately I've been trying to learn how it works by thinking about larger sums of money. I don't want to post this in ELI5 though because I appreciate the quality of knowledge here more, specifically about money.

Say you inherit $10 million or some other large amount of money.

1. What happens with your bank account? Do you still use a normal bank account like Wells Fargo or Bank of America? Or do you use a ""special"" bank.

2. Does it all stay in the same account? Or is it spread out somehow (yes i realize theres probably a trillion ways to do it. I'm only talking about whatever the 'norm' might be, or whats typical).

3. I often read you're supposed to find advisors and money managers. How does one go about finding these people that are quality and arent out to screw you over with fees in their favor?

4. How much would you lose every year to inflation, under normal conditions?

5. How much could you make on average with interest? How about with investing? How about for 3 types of risk... low, medium, and high risk, and their related percentages.

6. Is it really true you could just live off of the interest for the rest of your life, as long as you dont make huge purchases and blow it all? Basically... only touching the interest and not touching the initial sum?

7. If you live in the US, on average, how much of the initial 10 million would go to taxes? All state specifics aside that is... just ballpark in general.

8. Do you have to pay taxes on the interest you make if you're living off the interest (as stated above)?

9. Given all of the above, how much do you think you could make per year on interest, with all the factors taken into account (low-medium risk investing, inflation, taxes, all based in the US).

The yield sank to an all-time low of 1.642% early Wednesday, amid intensifying fears surrounding Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis. Global investors have been pouring into safer assets, pushing the 10-year yield below 1.672%, the previous low originally set in February 1946 and matched briefly last September.

 

Seven-year yields also at a new record low of 1.099%.

 

Concerns earlier this month about Greece’s future in the euro zone spurred a flight into safe-haven Treasurys that got yields near, but never through, record-low levels. Fears about Spain’s ability to support its banking system seems to be the straw that broke the camel’s back.

 

Breaking the 1946 low marks unfamiliar territory for benchmark 10-year Treasurys and their traders. The note recently yielded 1.644%.

 

“This is fear, and how can you determine how much further you can go when it’s an emotion-driven market,” asks David Coard, head of fixed-income sales and trading at The Williams Capital Group.

Many have cited 1.5% as a target. Others are using the steady 35bps spread over 10-year German bund yields as a gauge. So with those bunds yielding 1.28% recently, 10-year US yields may find some stability around 1.6%.

GAAP net income including net income from discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2013 was $3.35 billion
GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2012 was $2.89 billion


This accounts to a 16% increase in income and perhaps a slowing down of the price/clock fall. 

However, I just noticed:

Income Taxes – Our effective tax rate was 8% for the first quarter of 2013.
Income Taxes – Our effective tax rate was 18% for the first quarter of 2012.

Is this implying the following pre-tax incomes:
2013:   3.35 / 0.92 = $3.64 billion pre tax income
2012:   2.89 / 0.82 = $3.52 billion pre tax income. 

This seems very concerning right? Looking at it from this perspective, the 16% earnings growth turns into 3.4% growth.  
Am I missing something here? This looks very bad to me. Not an expert so please let me know if I'm missing something.

The topmost tip that I would get for this kind of situation is to repay credit card loans and student loans, which I agree. After these are repaid, the next step is to create an emergency fund (3 month usually). After that is done, what is next? Any age-dependent tips?

I opened my account just now, and I only have to wait for my sales and ACH to finalize next week before moving all my cash over.

Plus their mobile app looks like it eats Scottrades for dinner.  I'll use them for a month or so and write a review.
  


They seem the cheapest by far, and when I consider that I am even now, but would be up by 1.5% now if not for all the $7.95 trade commissions (I'm a low-baller currently, but have the $10k needed to open an account, though I would have to close my Scottrade account) it kind of makes me think...  
  
But there has to be a catch, right?  I mean, they can't undercut their competitors by so much and not give up something, I would think.  Any perspectives?  
  
EDIT: I got to be honest, someone just mentioned OptionsHouse, and taking a good look at them, they look a lot more pleasant to use for just a little bit more $$$.  $3.95 flat trades, and if you Google it, there's a promo for 100 free trades....

Risks Associated with Our Business
Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section titled “Risk Factors” immediately following this prospectus summary. Some of these risks are:
 
We have a short operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;

We have incurred significant operating losses in the past, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability. Our recent growth rate will likely not be sustainable, and a failure to maintain an adequate growth rate will adversely affect our results of operations and business;

We rely on traffic to our website from search engines like Google, Yahoo! and Bing. If our website fails to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to our website could decline and our business would be adversely affected;

If users do not value the quality and reliability of the reviews, photos and other content that we display on our platform, they may stop or reduce the use of our products, which could adversely impact the growth of our business;",,False,,t5_2qhhq,False,,,True,t3_qen20,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qen20/what_every_ipo_investor_needs_to_read_the_s1/,

This was a trade that cost around $5700. The current value of his position is roughly $2200 which represents about a 60% drop.

With these options there are only 12 trading days left to decide what to do with them before they're (hopefully) exercised.  The time premium on these options is almost gone (worth around .20 per option at this point) and so their only value is how much they're in the money.  If QQQ goes above $59/share (a 4% increase), these options will probably be valued at somewhere around $200 next week, losing about $30 in value each day they remain out of money.

For CPJ84 to even make his money back, QQQ must tank hard over the next twelve trading days--sustaining an 8-10% drop.

Realistically speaking, QQQ's price by the option expiration date will probably be about the same as it is today, netting CPJ84 about -$3,600 in this trade.

BOSTON (Reuters) - News that General Electric Co is selling its remaining stake in NBC Universal to Comcast Corp earlier than expected may be just what the largest U.S. conglomerate needed to get out of the penalty box.
Its shares rose 3 percent in postmarket trading to levels not seen in normal trading since October 2008 - when Chief Executive Jeff Immelt was forced to cut GE's dividend and sell additional shares amid fears that the financial crisis would wreck the future of GE Capital and perhaps the whole company.

The NBC deal, worth $16.7 billion, is part of Jeff Immelt's campaign to refocus the world's largest maker of jet engines and electric turbines on its industrial roots, as it exits media and scales back its GE Capital finance arm.
The company also said it would buy back $10 billion of its shares this year - roughly 4 percent of its market capitalization - and raise its total authorized stock buyback to $35 billion from $25 billion.
If GE's shares trade above $23.18 on Wednesday, they will be at their highest since October 2008. They passed that mark in postmarket trading on Tuesday hitting $23.34.

During the depths of the financial crisis, GE shares had dipped below $6.

""We have been looking forward to them moving away from that NBC Universal, and this will give them more capital,"" said Mike McGarr, a portfolio manager at Becker Capital Management in Portland, Oregon, which holds GE shares. ""In the end they will get back to what GE used to be and probably with higher margins.""
The higher stock buyback will get Immelt closer to his goal of reducing the company's total outstanding share count to its level before the company sold $15 billion in additional shares to investors including Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc during the crisis.

GE executives have repeatedly said they do not anticipate a repeat of the $11 billion wave of acquisitions the company embarked on in 2010 and 2011 to bulk up in the energy sector, which it funded with proceeds of the initial NBC deal.

""The core business that they have at the moment is fairly solid,"" said Morningstar analyst Daniel Holland. ""What I would look for them to do is repurchase shares.""

GE's initial 2010 deal to sell NBC Universal to Comcast had given it the option of selling the rest of its holdings to the No. 1 U.S. cable company in two stages, part in mid-2014 and the balance by the end of 2017. GE officials had said they were interested in selling the rest of the stake earlier rather than later.

LIVE FROM NEW YORK NO MORE?

In addition to the proceeds of selling the remainder of NBC - a deal expected to close by the end of the first quarter, more than a year earlier than investors had expected - GE is selling NBC-occupied floors at 30 Rockefeller Center to Comcast for $1.4 billion.

Built as the RCA Building in 1933, the 70-story building is the focus of the Rockefeller Center. It was renamed the General Electric Building in 1988 after GE required RCA, which it helped found in 1919. The building is home to the famous Rainbow Room club restaurant. Tishman Speyer co-owns the building.

The floors GE is selling include the studio where ""Saturday Night Live"" is produced, where Immelt and his top lieutenants have conducted the company's annual December outlook meetings. GE spokesman Seth Martin declined to comment on where GE would hold this year's meeting.

Immelt, who has run GE since 2001, has repeatedly emphasized to investors that the company would have a lot of cash to deploy in the coming years, reflecting both the NBC deal and Federal Reserve approval last year for GE Capital to resume paying a share of its profit back to the parent company.

""This company is going to have a ton of cash over the next three years,"" Immelt told investors in January. Immelt is scheduled to discuss the deal on a conference call Wednesday morning.

Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, which holds GE shares, said the higher buyback was welcome news.

""Additional share buybacks are likely to be positive for shareholders,"" Pursche said. ""The M&amp;A space right now has gotten a little expensive.""

I predict that history will repeat itself in the following weeks.

Looking into the past: 


On *June 7th, 2010*, Apple announced the iPhone 4. When the announcement was made, (AAPL) was priced at **~$250.94**. After the announcement (AAPL) stocks [declined](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AAPL+Interactive#symbol=aapl;range=20100607,20100609;compare=;indicator=bollinger+volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;) ~-3.08% with a low of **~$243.20**. This was good for the people who decided to short and the people that wanted a cheaper in to (AAPL). After two days of declining, the next ***eleven*** days (AAPL) steadily began to [rise](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AAPL+Interactive#symbol=aapl;range=20100609,20100618;compare=;indicator=bollinger+volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;) ~+12.69% ([+9.22% if the stock was purchased on announcement day](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AAPL+Interactive#symbol=aapl;range=20100607,20100618;compare=;indicator=bollinger+volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;)) with a peak of **~$274.07** before retreating again to a **~$250** near the end of June.


This happened once more with a larger outcome. The announcement for the iPhone 4s was made on *October 4th, 2011*. The stock hit an intraday low of **~$354.24**. In the next *thirteen* days (AAPL) would [peak](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AAPL+Interactive#symbol=aapl;range=20111004,20111017;compare=;indicator=bollinger+volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;) at **~$422** with ~+12.75% at the end of the day after the slight drop. 

Today (11/11/12), (AAPL) closed at **$660.59**. Looking at the two post-announcement pops, I predict a rise of ~+13% which would come out as somewhere around **~$746.46** as a target withing a time frame between *ten - fifteen days*.

This is only a prediction. Do what you please with this information. Criticism is welcomed. I give most credit to [Matthew Frankel](http://seekingalpha.com/article/858711-how-to-play-the-iphone-5-announcement).

**Best:** went long investing in DaVita (DVA) on 10/14/11 after some headlines surrounding a Medicare fraud lawsuit dragged the stock down to its lowest P/E in years, despite an awesome outlook for its next quarter. I built out a full model in Excel and nailed the EPS beat to the penny based on higher margins from lower pharmaceutical utilization, which to this day is one of my proudest investing/trading accomplishments. It goes to show that if you do enough research on boring, sleepy names it is possible to get a slight edge. It has outperformed the S&amp;P500 by ~25% since then.

**Worst**: went long (trading) Rite Aid (RAD) on takeover speculation. I had been a RAD bull from $1.30 but didn't commit my own capital until $1.85. After watching the stock skyrocket 10% to $2.05 in two days I was so sure that I was right that I didn't want to trim the position and take some profits/risk off the table - I got greedy and wanted the big homerun. Even worse, I had sized the position too large for a purely speculative short-term bet. As the rumors subsided, the stock plummeted quickly down below my stop loss but I got emotional and was convinced I was right. I didn't exit until $1.74 and to this day it is my biggest and most moronic loss I have ever taken. The best way to learn about the merits of rigid stop losses is to lose way more money than you should have. Hindsight is brutal.

If the odds of winning are 175,000,000 to 1, and that number is based on the combinations of numbers possible, not number of tickets sold, I figure there are 175,000,000 different ways the numbers could be drawn. With the jackpot at 500,000,000, what is stopping someone from buying 175 Million tickets, each with a different combination of numbers, to guarantee that they'll hit the jackpot?

Even if a ton is taken for taxes, if you opt for the lump sum you'll still get 360 million dollars once those taxes are factored in. Even if one other person won the jackpot, this is still 180 million. Odds are in your favor to win using this method aren't they?

**Update 2:** Apple sent me an email saying that as a ""record shareholder"" Computershare has all the ""direct records not sold through a broker"" from that time and I need to contact them. I'm getting really excited! This is looking like I'm actually going to get my stocks!

**Update 3:** A setback. Because the stocks weren't touched (no address updates) for so long they were considered abandoned and awarded to the state. The good news is I can probably still get them back, it's just going to be a battle. The representative at Compushare gave me a number to call to request an investigation.

Because of the down times, I've programmed myself to save most of my money. 

I've managed to buy a new car last year, put a down payment on buying my apartment a few years ago, and still have saved over 200k.

140k is in savings, about 80k is in mutual funds, but I can withdraw it anytime. 

I know very little about investing, but I do know that the money sitting in the bank is not really working for me. I feel SAFE, but also foolish. 

I don't have the huge balls to go crazy starting businesses, because I feel I won't have anything to fall back on (I'd like to move away from the film industry if possible).

I'm not sure exactly what I can do, that will be fun and profitable. I've thought about producing my own shows, but that could cost thousands with no real chance of making money back.

I'm looking for something safe that I can get into.

1376085792.0,35,self.investing,1k1yo2,A broker came to my house to convince me to set up a roth investment plan through his company. I know nothing about stocks or investing.,47,12,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1k1yo2/a_broker_came_to_my_house_to_convince_me_to_set/,"Basically I just want to know if this is a decent investment or if I should stay away.  I'm giving all this extra information because it just kind of creeped me out the way they guy even approached me.

This dude was just walking down the road in a suit, walked up my driveway, around my house, and knocked on the back door at 9a.m. on a thursday.  I don't have any close neighbors, and I have no idea where he even came from.  I was only even home from work due to a collapsed lung.  Anyway he asked me if I'd be interested in making any kind of investments.  We talked a little and I told him I would like to set up a retirement plan in a couple years, but wan't interested in anything right away.  He left, and I figured I'd never see him again.

2 years later, I get a call from him and he is all sorts of excited about this roth retirement plan.  He came to my house the next day with a shit ton of graphs and charts, numbers and big words.  What I got out of our meeting is, he works for a major brokerage and is starting his own branch in my town.  He want's to start me on a roth account, and put a few grand per year in a single stock, and just let it ride for 35 years (I'm 22)  He showed me a few different big company stocks and explained how the dividend is where the money is made.  The stocks will fluctuate and even ending at a lower percentage than what they started, would still profit a shitload of money, in the theory that the company dividend did not change and I put in $4000-$5500 each year.  He said I can switch stocks, sell, buy, whatever, at any point in time.  He contacts his other clients whenever a better opportunity comes up or if it's a good time to sell.  Everything sounds great to me, but what he wants is 2% every time there is a transaction.  There are no other fees, just 2% to move the money.  So every year when I deposit $5500, %2 of it goes to him.  Then when I invest the $5500, he gets 2% again.  If I want to sell $2000 worth of stock, that's another 2%.  2% seems like a lot to me and I know stocks are risky investments to begin with.  What am I getting myself into?  Is this 2% a normal rate?  Is this the investment for me?

First time poster.  I'm 28 and trying to take a more active approach to investing.  I make a decent salary (~82k) and I'm fairly cheap.  As a result, I've been able to pay off 31k in student loans, a $20k car, put about $50k in two 401k accounts, toss $30k into my Roth IRA, and save up 27k in cash in my 5 years in the workforce.  

I don't think I have any problems saving.  However, I've failed at investing every step of the way due to poor research (read: laziness) and acting on ""hot tips"". I got started as the recession was hitting so that is part of the problem.  As a result, I've kind of checked out and don't really take an active approach.  Even though I save a lot, I'm fairly certain that  my current rate of growth (near zero) isn't going to cut it.

Anyways, I have a few questions for the community and would appreciate any tips that might help me begin to actually make my money work for me as they say.

1) I recently changed jobs and have about 40k in a previous company's 401k account through fidelity. I foolishly have 100% in the company's stock. They're in the defense industry and I'm looking to bail before the fiscal cliff situation boils over.  Any recommendations for the best company to set up an IRA (for rolloever) with and/or tips for good funds to buy?  I have my other accounts with Scottrade and was thinking 
about that but if there's something better, I'm all ears.

2) I have about $27k in cash.  I'm not in any hurry to get a home, but the goal is that this money would eventually go towards a down payment and for now acts as a Rainy Day fund.  I generally can save 
at least 1k a month so I will keep adding to this going forwad.  For now, I've got it all in an ING account (0.80% APR).  This seems like a joke.  I will be lucky to get $200 a year in interest and will pay taxes on that as income.  Does anyone have any better ideas for investing this that are shorter term so I will have access (within a month or so) to it if needed?  

3) My Roth account has seen zero growth in the 5 years I've had it.  I believe I've made 29k in contributions and it's at 30k.  I have tried to pick stocks and time the market.  I also keep a big chunk in cash, since they say ""cash is king"".  Should I be looking at mutual funds for this account and take a much less active approach?  Is this the best route for all my accounts in general?

4) I have read many users suggest the book ""The Intelligent Investor"".  I plan on picking that up ASAP. Any other tips to get started?

I'd appreciate any help you guys might have.  Thanks in advance!",,False,,t5_2qhhq,False,,,True,t3_1091xx,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1091xx/28_years_old_need_help_getting_on_track/,

Unless anyone has an idea that I'm blind to (and willing to share!) I'm planning on just letting it sit until I have enough dividends to make a commission worth it, or deal with in in January when I add 2014 funds.

- I'm maxed out, so I can't add funds to make a larger purchase.

I was definitely spending more than 20 hours a week doing research and whatnot (basically, a part-time job at least).  My investments grew ~12% in 5 months--which is good.  However, if you're a broke college student ~12% of your nearly non-existent net worth is not very much money.  I did the math, and I was working for around $0.30/hr.

Fast-forward 3 years and now I have a decent stack of cash piled up.  I'm a little skeptical to start investing again, though.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed it.  I just don't feel like I have the time to spend 20+ hours investing.  Also, I don't foresee myself earning anywhere near my hourly wage--probably closer to $6.00/hr when it's all said and done.

So, was I just over-analyzing things?  Do you guys only spend an hour hear and there?  I feel like I made earnings at a moderately impressive rate.  Sure, I guess there are probably people that have quarters where they double their earnings.  But, isn't the common investor at the ~8% annual rate?

Or is everyone successful just making mad amounts of money of short trades now?  I could see how you could be successful if you were spending 40+ hours doing your research and making a good short trade or two per day.  But, otherwise, I don't see how you could possibly justify spending more than an hour hear and there--pretty much just for fun.",,False,,t5_2qhhq,1341247071.0,,,True,t3_vxhhj,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/vxhhj/how_much_time_do_you_invest_in_investing/,

So past Monday I executed a bunch of orders as a part of my portfolio rebalancing. It's all in my TFSA (like said in title, same principle as Roth 401k for you guys in the US).

My portfolio is similar to this:

* 20% TSLA
* 10% GM
* 10% GOOG
* 25% VTI (Vanguard total stock market)
* 20% BND (Vanguard total bond market)
* 15% VNQ (Vanguard total REIT)

So in those stocks, only the 3 last ETFs pay dividends.

Now the problem I have is that since those ETFs are in a TFSA, I get struck with the US 15% withholding tax on every dividend I receive and I have no possibility of getting them back. As a Canadian, if those ETFs were in a non-registered account, I would have been able to get them back. Same goes for an RRSP (similar as the traditional 401k for you guys in the US), there is an agreement with the US not to get that tax applied in the first place.

So now I wanted to save money with ETFs, but I get struck by a god damn tax.

My initial situation was:

* 50% TSLA (because of the jump in the share, started much lower)
* 35% some canadian market mutual fund
* 15% some canadian bond mutual fund

I switched to ETFs covering the american market because I am of the opinion that the Canadian market will underperform the US for the next couple of years at least. I also think there is an housing bubble in Canada, so REIT in Canada makes no sense for me.

But now I pay a tax also. I didn't know that when I made the trades to be fair, I learned it afterwards (I'm a self learner and I don't talk to anyone about my investing, so nobody gave me a warning).

What should be my strategy?

* Should I switch some things in Canada not to be taxed? I have thought to replace the bond one with a Canadian one and pay transactions fees on this.

* Should I switch them to the RRSP (same as traditional 401k)? Thing is I'm only 21 and my income is pretty low and I don't pay taxes, so basically I wouldn't decrease my income by one bit doing that, and I could save the space instead for when my revenues will be higher.

* Is there an alternative, say a Canadian mutual fund that mimics those ETFs but is in Canada meaning that I don't pay taxes? I have no idea if that works, just looking for a way to avoid those taxes !

* Any other option which I am not aware of?

This is actually very important, you cant have too many bears heading into a downturn, you need to have everybody feeling good about the market.

How this all pans out, we will soon find out. I remain longer term bearish, although a rally into the end of the year seems to be a possibility if the bulls can keep the momentum. We need a pull back to retest some support levels soon, todays chart indicates we may be coming close.

I've been reading this sub for a few weeks now and I am still unsure of what to do. Still in the process of learning this stuff so any help is appreciated. Here is my situation.

-27 years old with a family of 4 (soon to be 5). I make 50k a year but live in an area where the cost of living is low. 

-I will be starting a 529b for the kids in a few weeks that I plan to contribute to monthly.

-I have a Schwab IRA.  I put **1K** into a mutual fund (VFINX). I have roughly **$700** sitting as cash and that’s it as far as the IRA goes. So total, the IRA is at about $1,700.

-I have a separate 401k that is at about 2k and my new employer will contribute 5% regardless of what I contribute(the 2k will be rolled over into that, starting a new job tomorrow actually).

So here is my question. I have been itching to do something with this extra **$700** cash sitting in the IRA, even though it is a small amount. Would it be worth it to buy some ETFs? If so, are there any specific ETFs I should look into? I am looking for long term investment. I am only hearing bad things about CDs and bonds so I am curious if a non-leveraged ETF would be an option, or if I am better off just leaving it as cash for now.

Rick here.  You may remember me from [Forcastix](http://free.forcastix.com), my last project.  That site is now dead in the water, largely because we moved on to a new project, [QuantAdvisor](http://quantadvisor.com), which is the topic of this post.

QuantAdvisor provides backtesting against fundamental factors (point in time) over 15 years historically.  It also maintains models based on these factors to simulate an index based on the rules.  I basically took all the stuff I liked out of Bloomberg's factor backtest and threw it in a web tool.

I would identify myself as a capable 23-year-old college student with zero debt and ~$20k in assets (~$7k cash, remainder in other commodities). By the end of this year I'll have earned a guaranteed income of approx. $30k.

I'll continue to carefully read and absorb as much information surrounding money as I can both on Reddit and through various money talks, but would like some preliminary advice from the community regarding my entry into the market.

I'd like to start soon (Why wait? Don't answer that.) and have hope that the tentative methodology which I've outlined below (with some questions) will place me in a well-equipped position to begin accruing wealth.

==

* Initial buy-in: A few thousand USD in ETF's (SPY, MDY, and MOO) using Vanguard to obtain free ETF trades. If vehemently suggested, I will initiate this process over multiple months (perhaps ~$500 per ETF per month/bimonth).

* Should I establish a Roth IRA before attempting to delve into active trading? (+ any other priority moves?)

* Once I'm ready and have taken a few ETF positions, is Vanguard good enough to continue using for all trades, or should I use a brokerage like TradeKing (TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab) for purchasing/trading equities at moderate risk?


* Up until recently, all of the money that I haven't earned from formal employment has been dry income in playing small commodities (reselling things that I am comfortable with - music media, musical instruments, precious metals, gemstones and really, anything else that I can afford to get a bargain on and resell to the right customer). I'm interested to know how investors incorporate such cash profits into their portfolios. I don't own a business, thus have concerns for the legality of handling cash - it's not like I'm restoring cars and making tens/hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit and claiming it as income on my taxes.

My goal for the next few years is to build a relatively diverse and secure portfolio from which I can continually enable myself to take more specific (calculated, *high*) risks. I don't see myself relying on a retirement fund forty years from now, but taking all of the necessary steps to get started (Roth IRA, for example) shouldn't be avoided.

Thanks in advance. See you around (and looking forward to it).

Equities have continued to rally, with the S&amp;P 500 (INDEXSP:.INX) closing at a record high on Thursday. Meanwhile, silver has gone virtually nowhere, with its spot price remaining nearly unchanged from the last several weeks. A couple of firms project that when silver prices do start to move, they could be headed to the downside.

Even when investors who are in the market for safe-haven assets have been largely ignoring silver.

Wednesday, the metal took a notable intraday dip, falling to a low of $28.10. That occurred as gold and the dollar attracted safe-haven support from investors concerned about the opening of Cypriot banks following an extended closure due to the nation’s financial crisis. Silver eventually clawed its way back and closed on the New York spot market at $28.69, with losses of only $0.07.

On Thursday, after the Cypriot banks reopened, conditions were deemed relatively calm. The risk of bank runs in other nations did not materialize. The previous day’s safety seeking largely evaporated, and though that had not particularly benefited silver, the improved sentiment on Thursday did act as a source of pressure on the metal.

The COMEX futures market continues to reveal participants’ bearish sentiment. Last week’s Commitment of Traders report shows that speculative shorts added over 530 metric tons (MT). Shorts are now at three times the five-year average, according to Standard Bank.

ETF investors have been loyal supporters of silver, buying and holding the metal despite its price weakness and the negative sentiment reflected in the futures market. But last week, it appears some investors’ confidence may have wavered as holdings dropped by nearly 80 MT.

The London Bullion Market Association’s (LBMA) clearing statistics for February reveal a 20-percent decline in the amount of silver transferred between accounts. While there was rise in the number of transactions, there was also a 22-percent decline in total transaction value. Kitco said the LBMA noted that this decrease is likely indicative of smaller deals being settled.

“We believe silver should be approached from the short side on rallies on approach of $31 at this stage,” said Standard Bank. “We see a good possibility that the metal could test the 2012 lows around $26.50 in the near term,” the firm added.

Scotiabank has a similar outlook for silver. Noting that the metal has been in the $27.98 to $29.44 range since mid-February, the firm said, “we have been bearish silver looking for another leg lower to $26.”

These projections come on the heels of several other firms downgrading their average price forecasts for the metal.

The close

COMEX May silver ended the Thursday floor session at $28.32 with losses of $0.29. Silver lost $0.33 on the New York spot market, closing at $28.36.

Company news

Silver Wheaton (NYSE:SLW,TSX:SLW) reported a fourth consecutive year of record attributable silver equivalent production in 2012. The 29.6 million ounces represented a 17 percent increase. Sales of 27.3 million ounces represented a 30 percent increase. In line with these results, the company reported record net earnings of $586 million, which is 15 percent higher than those reported in 2011.

“2012 was another exceptional year for Silver Wheaton, anchored by a fourth quarter that saw record production, sales, revenue, net income, and cash flow for the company,” said Randy Smallwood, President and CEO of Silver Wheaton. He added that 2012 production exceeded the company’s forecast by over one and a half million ounces.

Cream Minerals (TSXV:CMAOTCBB:CRMXF) announced an updated resource estimate for the Nuevo Milenio silver-gold project in Nayarit State, Mexico. The company says this resource estimate completely replaces any that it has previously filed. It is contained in an independent technical report, which replaces the report filed in October 2012. The report also addresses concerns that were raised by the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC).

With regards to the 2012 report, the BCSC’ concerns include the methodology, key assumptions and parameters used in to prepare the mineral resource estimates, disclosure of non-compliant mineral resource, improper reliance on experts and the author’s experience in relation to the subject matter.

Argentex Mining (TSXV:ATX,OTCQB:AGXMF) announced Austral Gold (ASX:AGD) has committed to a $5 million strategic investment. The deal will involve Argentex issuing over 17.3 million share units at a price of $.28 each. A unit includes one common share, one half of a share purchase warrant, and each warrant will allow the purchase of an additional common share at $.40 for 60 months from the closing date.

Michael Brown, President and CEO of Argentex, said one of the benefits of this strategic investment is that it will enable the advancement of development activities at the company’s flagship Pinguino silver-gold project in Santa Cruz, Argentina.

Columbian Mines (TSXV:CMJ,OTC Pink:CMBPF) said reconnaissance work has identified additional high grade mineralization at its Mercedes property in Columbia. The results include up to 2.3 grams gold per MT, 203 grams silver per MT and 10.1% copper in grab samples from outcropping mineralization in a new area approximately 1.5 kilometers wide by 2 kilometers long.

This new area is located roughly 3.3 kilometers south southeast of the area where previously announced mineralization returned results to 49.8 grams (1.6 troy ounces) gold, 744 grams (23.9 troy ounces) silver per MT and 26.47% copper.

Robert Carrington, president and CEO of the company, said, “we are still a long way from being able to call it a discovery but finding so much high grade mineralization over such a large are on a first pass reconnaissance program suggests a large, strong mineralized system is present with excellent discovery potential.”

______________________________

**EDIT 2** This is how I'm thinking about changing my investments:

**401k**

* RDJTX: American Funds Trgt Date 2055: $5626

**Roth IRA** $10,500

* Vanguard REIT Index Fund Investor Shares (VGSIX)
* Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX)
* Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VGTSX)
* Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund (VBMFX)

**Taxable** Unknown amount

* Likely some index fund, recommendations?

I will try and achieve the following holding %:

* US stocks: 50%
* Foreign Stocks: 25%
* REIT: 10%
* Bonds: 15%

I might have to start initially with a larger % in the REIT due to the fund minimum of 3k, but I'll balance this out over time.

The largest variable factor is how much of the GCOM stock I invest and how much I put into my student loans.


______________________________________
I will be opening a Roth IRA in the coming weeks, and I want to make sure that my investments are diverse enough.  Also is there anything obvious that I'm missing?  Also I'm 24, and am currently putting 4% matched into my 401k.

**Format**
Ticker: Fund Name (Expense Ratio) [Portfolio %]

**Taxable accounts [63.4%]**

* USNQX: Nasdaq 100 Index Fund: $5,676 (.78%) [19.4%]
* USSBX: Short-Term Bond Fund: $3,028 (.63%)  [10.3%]
* Lending Club: $534 [1.8%]
* Stock GCOM: $9,292 [31.8%]

**401k [19.4%]**

* RDJTX: American Funds Trgt Date 2055:$2,861 (.81%) [9.7%]
* RGVEX: US Government Securities Fund: $1,110 (.61%) [3.8%]
* RLBEX : American Balanced Fund: $569 (.65%) [1.9%]
* RWMEX: Washington Mutual Investors Fund $569(.65%) [1.9%]
* PCVAX: AllianzGI NFJ Small-Cap Value A: $575(1.19%) [2.0%]

**Roth IRA Plan [17.1%]**

I'm currently debating whether to go with a Vanguard or USAA Roth IRA.  I believe that I will do a 50/50 split of $5000 into a target and S&amp;P 500 index fund.

USAA:

* URFFX: Target 2050 Fund (.78%)
* USSPX: S&amp;P Index Fund (.26%)


OR


Vangaurd:

* VFFVX: Target 2055 Fund (.18%)
* VFINX: 500 Index Fund (.17%)


Do I currently have to many funds, particularly in my 401k?

1359493697.0,31,self.investing,17inh3,A great statement from Warren Buffet's shareholder's letter.,35,4,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17inh3/a_great_statement_from_warren_buffets/,"The second major category of investments involves assets that will never produce anything, but that are
purchased in the buyer’s hope that someone else – who also knows that the assets will be forever
unproductive – will pay more for them in the future. Tulips, of all things, briefly became a favorite of
such buyers in the 17
th
century.

This type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers, who, in turn, are enticed because they
believe the buying pool will expand still further. Owners are not inspired by what the asset itself can
produce – it will remain lifeless forever – but rather by the belief that others will desire it even more
avidly in the future.

The major asset in this category is gold, currently a huge favorite of investors who fear almost all other
assets, especially paper money (of whose value, as noted, they are right to be fearful). Gold, however,
has two significant shortcomings, being neither of much use nor procreative. True, gold has some
industrial and decorative utility, but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable of
soaking up new production. Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still
own one ounce at its end.

What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During the
past decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generated
additional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis.
As “bandwagon” investors join any party, they create their own truth – for a while.

Over the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses
that can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In these
bubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the “proof” delivered by the market,
and the pool of buyers – for a time – expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubbles
blown large enough inevitably pop. And then the old proverb is confirmed once again: “What the wise
man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.”

Today the world’s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it
would form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At
$1,750 per ounce – gold’s price as I write this – its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.

Let’s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400
million acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world’s most
profitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would
have about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying
binge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?
Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today’s annual
production of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers – whether jewelry and industrial users,
frightened individuals, or speculators – must continually absorb this additional supply to merely
maintain an equilibrium at present prices.
A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn,
wheat, cotton, and other crops – and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the
currency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its
owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The
170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can
fondle the cube, but it will not respond.

Admittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it’s likely many will still rush to gold. I’m
confident, however, that the $9.6 trillion current valuation of pile A will compound over the century at
a rate far inferior to that achieved by pile B.

We have to choose how to allocate money we put into it from a bunch of different options and frankly we've got no clue what we're doing here.  My cousin who has a bit more experience in this but admits that he's no expert either said that investing a ""passive growth portfolio"" makes the most sense because that's all stocks which over the long term out perform the more conservative bonds.  He explained that ""active"" means that the portfolio is managed by a broker who researches stocks and makes decisions but it has a higher transaction cost while the ""passive"" portfolios tend to have less switching around and are just bought by algorithm.  He said that since everyone tends to under-perform compared to the market average anyway, the extra cost associated with active management is probably not worth it.  He also didn't suggest going with ""age-based"" portfolios that become more conservative as our son gets closer to 18 because those last years may well be the best market-wise.

There's also social choice portfolios which he said are sometimes really ""good"" but sometimes bullshit labels.  There's also an ""Index US Large Cap Equity  Portfolio"" and I've no clue what that is at all.

Which means blasting 1000 orders in 100ms will begin overloading the network and cause delays after just the first 100 messages.

For the record, I'm not trying to evade any taxes or anything like that, I'm just interested in seeing what is and isn't possible, as well as seeing how difficult it is to obtain/manage an offshore account (I might use it for a topic in a paper for uni).

I have already read about options and understand the following: When you **Buy** an option, you are essentially buying the right, not the obligation, to buy/sell a stock at a given price. Now say if I am betting that a stock will go down, and it does, I can exercise a PUT option that I previously purchased to buy the shares at the new low price and sell them at the strike price and profit. 

If the stock price goes up or does not change, then I can just let the options expire and only risk losing the small amount I paid for that option, which as I understand can be $6-10 depending on the broker. 

So what is so risky about losing $10? I realize that when **selling** options your risk is potentially unlimited because you might be obliged to buy shares at a loss-making price. But not buying, right?

Also, is there any other incentive to selling options rather than buying, aside from instant money (contract price) in your pocket?

This has not been my experience although I am a young investor. 

In this market I suggest paying cash for foreclosed property and not taking any mortgage. I have three homes and I have an average $13k invested in each house (including repairs). The house I bought for $8.5k was once sold for $80k (and that's just the official record - could be more). 

I have a property manager who helps find the houses, fix them, and rent them. For these services I split the property 55/45. We rent these houses on average for $650 a month. If you do the math that's a gross return of about 60% on each home which brings my half to a cool 32%. Property taxes on houses like these are a joke and maintenance on a one story, three-four bedroom house is equally low. 

I think the mistake is that too many people stay away from poor family housing. Sure, your three story mansion in middle-class suburbia looks much nicer than my inner-city shack, but if I'm making twice the return I don't complain.

1316380766.0,31,self.investing,kjtdj,"Looking towards the week of Sept 19th, Im still bearish, here is what I see: (chart within)",46,15,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kjtdj/looking_towards_the_week_of_sept_19th_im_still/,"Good afternoon traders!

[S&amp;P 500 Chart with lines all over the place](http://i.imgur.com/WrjdN.gif)


Last week I had a chart that showed the wedge pattern going into Sept 14th. I went into the week with a bearish bias due to the European problems that have been plaguing the markets, we ended up breaking to the upside and making some amazing moves with 5 days of straight gains. That is some serious short covering!

Unfortunately I sat it out and did not get any trades in as I watched in amazement as CNBC marched the bulls out and proclaimed that things are looking rosy once again. I could not bring myself to buy anything to the long side last week... I missed out, but I know plenty of traders that made big moolah on AAPL and AMZN longs.

For me its better to have no trade than to be on the wrong side of the momentum like we had last week, so Im ok with that.

Coming into this week, we are faced with the exact same issues we had for all of August. Has anything really changed? Will something happen this week that will change it? If yes, that we should be rallying hard into Bernanke Thursday where he will announce something magical and save the market! 

If nothing magical is announced, then I feel we are finally ready to whack this market lower in spectacular fashion.

As I mentioned in last weeks chart, the bottom two indicators there are called oscillators, they are lagging indicators, as in they show you what has already happened. The shorter term one (at the bottom) has already hit overbought levels, the longer term one (MACD above it) is just starting to roll over now. I have indicated in white arrows how the MACD rollover has coincided with the short term tops. If we can do 3 for 3 here, plus if we see a big red candle indicating the bears have taken control once again, I will be feeling more confident grabbing some SPY Oct puts using the high we put in this week as my stop level to bail out that trade should I be wrong.

Remember, we are are looking for a reversal pattern which is usually a big move in the opposite direction of the trend, followed by a retest that fails to make a new high.

Thats about it!

Good luck and lets watch how this unfolds!

Criticism and DURRR TA stupid comments are most welcomed!


Edit: EURUSD has opened for trading, currently down 100 pips indicating some of the bullish bias has evaporated over the weekend


Edit #2: As the fine gentlemen (bitmonkey and TheHairyMan) below have stated, the USD is worth watching for confirmation of everything I have mentioned above.

[Click for daily chart of the US dollar index](http://finviz.com/fut_chart.ashx?t=DX&amp;cot=098662&amp;p=d1)

See in that chart how the 78 area was resistance in Oct-Nov of 2010?
See how 78 was resistance again in Feb-Mar 2011?

If 78 gets taken out with conviction, then you can bet that this market is heading for new lows for the year.

It's based off Larry Connors and Cesar Alvarez's strategy about buying 10 day lows.  Essentially this is my set-up and results:

**Signals**

Buy

* Security is priced above the 50 day MA, and
* Security is priced above 100 day MA, and
* Security hits a new 10 day low

Sell

* A new 10 day high is met, or
* Price drops below the 50 day MA, or
* Price drops below our stop loss, or
* We've been holding the security for 10 days

**Results:**

Annual returns | Average number of trades:

* 2008: 45.74% | 33
* 2009: 82.90% | 38
* 2010: 71.11% | 36
* 2011: 32.32% | 31
* 2012: 42.66% | 39


**Methodology**

tl;dr: I backtested every ticker in the SP500 and collected every trade that could have been made.  I walked through each year 1,000 times randomizing my sequence of trades to return an average annual return and standard deviation. 

The program begins by back testing a predefined set of tickers (SP500 in this case) using the buy and sell signals listed above.  In order to reduce biased results I ‘walk’ through the time period, that is I fed the program a single day at a time.  Each day I calculated buy signals and if the conditions were met I'd purchase the security, hold it, and continue to cycle through each proceeding day and calculated sell signals.  

Once the security was bought and sold I'd write down the trade and move onto the next day. The end result was a list of every single trade that could have potentially occurred in the predefined date range with the predefined list of tickers.

I'd sort these entries by purchase date in ascending order (oldest first) and every trade that fell on the same day was put into a list and archived in a dictionary with key-word purchaseDate.  The result was a data structure I could query and pull a list of all trades that could have occurred on a specified date. 

I then had all the information I needed to begin the actual back test.  I began with the first possible purchase date, searched the dictionary to obtain a list of all possible trades that could have occurred on that day, chose one at random, wrote down the trade's information, and moved onto the next available purchase date.  

Once all dates were exhausted I calculated an annual return by finding the product of all the year's trades. I did this 1,000 times in order to obtain the average and standard deviation of annual returns.  Since my data didn't tell me which trade occurred when it was impossible for me to define the exact sequence of trades.  My idea was if I got enough random trade sequences I could create a universe of possible scenarios with the most likely being the most prevalent -- it was a way for me to calculate a return and cover all my bases at the same time.

This is the resume I came with, after reading some books and with the help of wikipedia. This is what I had liked to have found when I started. Note that (i) It could contain errors, omissions and simplification (ii) It could be too basic and (iii) My English is poor. Without further ado, here it is:

**Why to invest?**

You can't afford not to invest. If you're not a business owner, the inflation will eat your capital year by year. You need to make your money work for you, producing *at least* as much as the inflation rate. If your investments surpass inflation, thanks to the magic of compound interest, you'll end multiplying your capital.

**What is compound interest? What is the Rule of 72?**

Compound interest is when you add the interest earned to the capital. In this way your investment grows exponentially. The rule of 72 (or Rule of 70) is a quick way to estimate how much time it will take to double your capital. You just need to divide 72 by the interest percentage. For example if you have an investment with 12%/year, it will take you 6 years to double your money.

**What is a bond?**

It basically an IOU note. The issuer (a government or a company) sell pieces of a debt to the investors and it is obliged to pay the principal plus interests at a later date. Government bonds are relative secure.

**What are stock and shares?**

**Stock** is the capital paid or invested in a company. The stock is divided in **shares** that can be sold and bought. The owner of some shares or *shareholder* can receive a portion of the company profit or *dividends*. The stock price changes according to the conditions of the company and the market, so if you invest in stocks you can get a high return or a big loss just by the fluctuation in the share value.

**What is an index?**

An index is a measure of the value of certain markets. It is computed from the price of selected stocks. An example is the S&amp;P 500 index.

**What is a fund?**

When you invest in a fund, your money goes to a pool. The fund manager buys shares and bond and the benefit or losses go to the fund investors. In this way you get the benefit of the shares and bonds with less volatility.

**What is an ETF?**

An **ETF** or **Exchage Trade Fund** is a fund that is traded by buying and selling stock.

**What are commodities?**

Commodities are raw materials, like oil, gold, coffee. You can buy and sell them as stocks.

**What are options?**

Maybe someone else could explain it in simple terms?

**What is diversification and why should I care?**

As you saw, if you invest in stocks of a few companies, their prices could change drastically and you could end losing a big percentage of your capital. To protect you against that scenario, it's recommendable  to invest in different markets: big and small companies; national and foreigners; real state, industries, services and commodities; funds and bonds.

**So, how do I start to invest?**

Here should come instructions on how to open an account, depending on your nationality. For example, if you're an USA resident: {explain how to open a broker account, 401(k) and ROTH IRA}

If you're a foreigner wanting to invest in USA: {where to open an account, alternatives to the 401(k) and how to avoid taxes if your country and USA have a double taxation agreement.}.

**Strategies to invest**

If you're a newbie, take the safe road. Spend less than what you earn. Invest a portion of your saving each month in ETFs. Keep your ETFs diversified, for example {here come some suggestions}. If you're American {401(k), ROTH IRA, ETFs}. Let the compound interest with monthly contributions work for you.

As you can see, it's incomplete. I hope it could be useful and that someone with more knowledge could fill the voids and correct it.

1348066889.0,31,self.investing,104zg1,Investing for inflation,38,7,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/104zg1/investing_for_inflation/,"Assume for a second that QE∞ has us heading headlong into significant inflation*. Where do you put your cash? For the sake of the story, lets say a $500k portfolio, early 30's, no immediate cash needs, long term horizon.

*it may not, but that's a debate for elsewhere

Most of the alternatives to cash in a mattress aren't very appealing, so I'm looking for ideas/thoughts. Here's my thinking on the options

**Stay cash**

Doesn't seem like a very good option, even with minimal inflation you're still just letting your money waste away. Upside is that inflation is your only real threat of 'capital loss' (at least the purchasing power of it), so only a big risk if we go straight up weimar. 

**Bonds**

Who's? Not feeling all that warm and fuzzy about any government debt and the yields are so low as to be hardly worthwhile. Interest rates *could* go down from here, but at some time there'll be some mean reversion with rates rising. Long term bonds with interest rates where they are doesn't seem wise, and yields on short term are so low as to be worthless. Some corporates are yielding enough to be worth a look, but it seems like a popular side of the boat to be on given the lack of yield anywhere else. Plus, if we get high inflation, you're going to get killed with bonds.

**Gold**

Gold often comes up as a recommendation for 'inflation protection', but I'm not convinced it's anything more than a store of value, and even that assumes it stays as 'appealing' as it is now. If we do get into an inflationary period demand for gold would surely rise pushing gains beyond that of just any increase in price due to inflation, but will it ever take on mass appeal? I dunno... 

**Broad index funds**

Market is almost back at its pre crisis highs, but really, what's been fixed? What's different? With QE infinity is it really to the moon and beyond? Or are we just getting read for another kick in the ass? 

**Dividend stocks**

Seems like a few good options here, but are they as good as they look? Take VZ for example... ~5% dividend, but a pretty lofty P/E. I guess if you're looking long term short term 'corrections' don't matter so long as you're still making the dividend. Will the end of the Bush tax cuts put some downward pressure on dividend stocks? Thinking about it too much?

**Commodity companies**

Not so much commodities themselves, but oil majors, miners etc. Should protect you from inflation, but if we are in for a broader global slowdown commodities will get punished. You've got to think that if we do get to 'high' inflation it's because the fed is pushed to do even more as a result of ongoing economic malaise. I love oil stocks for long term, but short/medium not so sure.

**TIPS**

Really not a fan. I think the Govt is very incentivized to understate inflation for the foreseeable future (with so much tied to inflation). Plus, treasuries don't yield squat, so not much better than the mattress again.

Anyone else have thoughts on inflation prep strategies? Other options? Give all the money to a fund manager and hope they don't suck? What sort of allocations and where?


**EDIT**: Thanks for the feedback, got some ideas for a bit more research. Sorry to that one guy that got all mad because I mentioned shadowstats (even though I said I didn't agree with all it's claims)

**

Time to submit your pick for the September contest! Rules are the same as they were last month. A Google spreadsheet that tracks results in real time will be created and posted to the sidebar.

Feel free to use this thread as a place to respectfully discuss/critique each other's picks. Thanks for participating and good luck! 

**RULES:**

* **NEW RULE**: *You MUST include your rationale for the pick you make.* I forgot to include this with the original posting so this applies only to those making picks after this was edited in. Your pick will be discarded if you fail to include your rationale. If you're new to investing, don't feel discouraged. Write what you can and hopefully you'll learn a thing or two following your stock.
* Each person will pick one stock, long (in hopes that the share price will rise) or short (in hopes that the share price will fall).
* The purpose of this is to share investment ideas, not to see who gets lucky with a speculative coin toss. As a result, each pick must meet the following criteria: must be a **stock** traded on US exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX - ADRs are ok, REITS and ETFs are not), market cap &gt; $500 million, average daily volume &gt; 50,000 shares (this information can be found on Yahoo Finance or Google Finance).
* Before you submit your pick, check to be sure no one else has already taken it. Duplicates are not allowed.
*  Deadline to submit your pick is 8am EDT on Thursday, September 1st. At that time I will take a screen print of this thread. **You may edit your pick until then.**
* You *may not* change your pick at any time during the month.
* You *may* pick the same stock from previous competitions if you wish.
* Winner will be determined by the stock that rises (or falls in the case of shorts) the most on a percentage basis from the open on September 1st to the close on September 30th.
* Prizes: Flair and a month's worth of r/Investing sidebar glory.

Picks that do not meet the above criteria will be discarded.",,False,,t5_2qhhq,True,,,True,t3_jxvb8,http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jxvb8/submit_your_pick_for_the_rinvesting_september/,moderator

I'm starting to look at ETF funds to invest in. But there's so many of them, I'm unsure what to look for, or what criteria to use to make a decision which ones deserve my money.

Can anyone give me some simple advice how to pick and choose?

Granted, I know this happens for some other companies, and I realize that RRENF's price isn't all that high (slightly less than $4). Yet I've observed that a number of other international equities either have no news or simply aren't listed at all.

They rolled out their new line of all-natural Kombucha drinks that seem promising as we approach the summer.

This is a continuation of Reddit’s virtual stock exchange game played on Marketwatch last year and in Q1 of 2013 that wrapped up yesterday (cheers to the 7,000+ people that played!)

I used to run this game with people from work, it was always a lot of fun. Here is how it works: This website (run through marketwatch.com) uses the real and active stock market to get its data, it then gives you a set amount of fake money to make trades. It delays the trades like the real market would, it lets you do short sales, set limits on buys and sales, do all kinds of real market tricks as if it was a real trade.

I'm setting up a new game for Reddit to play, the stakes have been raised from 100k to A MILLION DOLLARS (cue Dr. Evil face). The rules are simple. You get $1,000,000 to start off with. The game will run 3 months, starting on Monday 5/27/2013 at 9am EST. It will end on 8/30/2013. Players can join at any time. No stocks can be bought for less than $2 (this prevents someone from putting all $1,000,000 into penny stocks, then when they rise 1 cent selling and then not trading any more till the game ends. &gt;$2 makes the game more risky.) 

All symbols and markets are open to be played. Each trade will cost a $10 commission. Selling on the margin is disabled, you only have your $1,000,000 to play with. Short selling is enabled. You cannot trade in partial shares (must purchase in full share increments).

www.marketwatch.com/game/the-reddit-challenge-1-million-dollar-game-

You will need to make an account to play, which is free.

The more people play the more fun this is. Last game had 7,540 players, 10k players this time around would be awesome!

Update: Official subreddit created: http://www.reddit.com/r/Reddit1MStockGame

I personally know very little about the stock market, I've never traded for real money, only this game. Everything I know I learned from playing this game, it is quite educational. It can be as complicated and time consuming as you want to make it, we used to have guys who would flat out day-trade the game, and others who made a few purchases and then let it ride for the whole game.

The game is now up and running, hope to see you there.

My current retirement planning has been to put about 15% of each paycheck into a 401(k) and to max-out a Roth IRA every year.  I already have a significant amount of savings (more than I should for a emergency fund).

My new salary will result in me being ineligible for a Roth IRA.  My first question is, as I'll be switching jobs mid-year, am I eligible to continue contributing to a Roth IRA this year?  If so, would all contributions to it need to be made before I switch jobs?

Second, I plan on maxing out my 401(k) at my new job.  After this, what are some of the best options for investing?  Even if I were to still have a Roth IRA I would need an extra retirement plan anyway, so I'll have a significant amount of money that I need to invest.

I have no debt and fully own my car.  Currently I rent, and while I plan on buying a house at some point, I may be moving soon so I'm planning on continuing to rent.  However, I would like to be able to save up for a down payment in addition to saving for retirement.
