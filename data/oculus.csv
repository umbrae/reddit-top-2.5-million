1371517358.0,750,self.oculus,1gjzse,Oculus just got $16 million in funding. We are going to use it to build the best VR platform ever.,861,111,184,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1gjzse/oculus_just_got_16_million_in_funding_we_are/,"(crosspost from our Kickstarter update: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game/posts/512945)

In case you didn’t see the announcement, we have great news to share: we’ve raised $16 million in a Series A funding round co-led by Spark Capital and Matrix Partners, along with Founders Fund and Formation 8. This level of financial support opens incredible new doors for Oculus, and I’d like to provide a bit of context and backstory.

I have been working on virtual reality technology for years. Starting in a garage, prototyping new hardware, and collaborating with other virtual reality enthusiasts was a blast long before anyone thought VR was poised for a comeback. Hackers, makers, and enthusiasts live on the bleeding edge of tech not because it makes financial sense, but because it is a thrill that you cannot get anywhere else.

I got into VR because it seemed like the obvious path to the best possible gaming experience, but never expected it to take off so quickly. In less than a year, incredible game developers all over the world are building games designed explicitly for virtual reality, and people are beginning to understand that the tech is finally viable. Even with ""next generation"" consoles on the horizon, VR still came away with dozens of awards and accolades at E3.

We were fortunate enough to be able to pick investors who we thought would be a great fit. They really believe in our vision for the future of VR. These are people who have taken companies from startup to mass market many times, entrepreneurs who have a ton of meaningful experience building hardware and software consumer technology.

As I mentioned before, the funding opens up all sorts of doors for Oculus. It helps us hire the best and brightest minds in VR from around the world. It lets us experiment and prototype with more cutting-edge tech. And it allows us to build a badass, consumer VR gaming platform, the likes of which the world has never seen.

Virtual reality will be one of the most significant technologies of the 21st century. It has the potential to drastically alter the way we play, communicate, and learn. I think that VR can (and will) be as widely used as Facebook or Twitter, and the societal implications will be far greater!

I want to thank everyone for their support. None of this would be possible without you, the people who supported Oculus when it was nothing but a rough prototype and a dream of changing gaming forever!

I'm sad to say I was overall a bit disappointed. I wanted to love it, and was so psyched to see so many positive reactions to it at CES. I may have overhyped it for myself. Or maybe the CES implementations were done better. I don't know.

In my experience (and everyone else's), I got to try two separate unity environments. One was a an outdoor autumn pumpkin field; the other was inside a spaceship. When I first put it on I did immediately notice the resolution. The individual pixels are directly in front of your face and magnified, so yes, they are noticeable. I was aware of this beforehand, but I didn't anticipate that I'd think the resulting image quality through the rift would look way worse than on the monitor. You can also see black to the left and right extents of your vision, but not up and down. Hopefully these problems will be somewhat improved with the larger screens and less apparent screen door effect of the dev kits.

I also felt that something was off with the software implementation (this was unity and not unreal). Hills in the background did not really look far away. I recall people commenting previously that they could really feel the scale of things, and that was not the case for me. The most noticeable 3d effect was when something was very close to you. Other than that the effect fell off quickly. The mountains felt about as far as something else that might be 10 feet away, which caused everything past that point to seem very flat, and made me realize I was looking at a screen. Conversely, I'd look directly down at some pumpkins, and they felt like they were an inch from my nose. There is some sort of warping of depth going on, and it was hard to tell what it was the cause of it. I'm not sure if it could be attributed to the spherical warping to accommodate the lenses. Perhaps the convergence was set a bit off. It almost felt as if your vision was zoomed in a bit, like looking through low powered binoculars. For me, these were the biggest problems. The space station was overall a better experience to some degree, but it's hard for me to tell you why. I'd have to guess its less distant backgrounds illustrated more depth.

Head tracking felt overall ok and responsive. You do notice though when you look down and your head swivels on an incorrect axis, not accounting for your head rotating at the base of your skull. I'm aware that this can be improved with some implementation of positional tracking.

All this stuff together prevented me from fooling my brain and feeling like I was magically plopped into a new world, which maybe was what I had hyped myself up to experience. I do realize for that to happen, that everything might have to be pretty perfect. I'm hoping it won't take several generations of hardware.

I hope nobody feels I'm being too negative, and I am still very much looking forward to getting my dev kit in March. I so badly want VR technology to advance, and I just happen to be pretty critical. Thankfully, I think most of the problems I had were in the software. I'm looking forward to the Unreal engine and other people's implementations, and I'll sure as hell try to figure out what I thought the apparent problems were on my own.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_18t23v,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/18t23v/oculus_rift_impressions_from_indiecade_east/,

We sorted out the EU issues quickly, but there are still roughly 3,500 units held up at the US port by customs.

We’ve received information from customs about what’s causing the hold-up and we’re working with the right people to resolve it as fast as we can. Customs’ job is to ensure everything coming into the US is safe and within regulations to enter the US market. Their approval process is beyond our control -- All we can do is work with them to make sure they have everything they need as fast as we can.

We don't have a firm date for when the units will be released yet. We have Oculus team members at the port, communicating with customs to try and resolve everything more quickly. We’ll keep everyone posted on updates/changes via @oculus on Twitter and on the Oculus Forums.

Just to throw one more wrench in the works, we made a mistake in fulfillment last week that's caused plenty of expected confusion on the forums. We shipped roughly 100 kits to US customers from extra stock that had already cleared customs from the last batch. Unfortunately, there was a mix-up and and we sent these dev kits to customers at the end of the order list rather than the beginning. This was completely our mistake and we’re really sorry for the mix-up plus the resulting confusion.

We're working around the clock on getting these units out of customs and we’ll keep you updated on progress until kits are being delivered smoothly again. Sorry again, and thanks for your patience.

Yesterday, I had the privilege of demonstrating Oculus Rift at some of the largest architecture firms in the world.  Every single person who tried it on was convinced of it's potential for architectural applications -  if not completely blown away, by it.  

It is unanimously the sense of scale you get inside of a Rift that sells it from an architectural standpoint.  The way I set up the demo was to first show my residential build (posted on Reddit earlier) as a regular standalone Unity3D app projected on their conference room screen, and talked about Unity in general, the process we use to import architectural projects into it, and how the same build could be published to an Android Tablet, iPad tablet, embedded on a web page with Unity3D, etc.

Then I show them the same build inside of an Oculus Rift.  The side-by-side comparison of seeing the same project depicted on a 2D surface contrasted with an Oculus Rift experience of the exact same build was enough to convince even the skeptics.  I don't think most people realize just how distorted traditional illustrations really are, and most underestimate just how immersive and engaging the Rift experience is until they try it.   

I then walked them through the Tuscany demo, downtown Dubuque, and concluded with a few rounds of Proton Pulse. 

Rift, or something like it, will be on every architect's desk in the future.

So, SKYRIM! The first part of the video is my very first time loading it up. I break halfway to fix issues, and then it gets REALLY fun! Some things to note:  
  
* With an Xbox 360 Controller attached, the mouse becomes inactive. You only get roll out of the Rift (although I just thought there was no head tracking whatsoever while playing). Anyone know of a mod to have mouse and controller active simultaneously?

* The SkyrimPrefs.ini must be edited after ANY options changes. I changed it once and thought I was done, but Skyrim put in shadows behind my back. :D  
  
* The dragon. Good God, THE DRAGON.
  
* When the computer takes control of the camera for a cut scene, its not always uncomfortable... the part before the chopping block was pretty rough though.

We're on track to deliver all the Kickstarter orders before the end of May (though the last international orders are may not reach backers til early June since some countries take a long time to move a package through).

We'll start fulfilling website pre-orders in late May / early June. It's impossible to give exact dates/numbers when we're dealing with so many moving parts, but if you ordered in 2012, we expect you'll have your kit in June. If you're placing an order today, the wait will definitely be a little longer.  Our order rate keeps going up, we had a lot more orders last month than previous months; We just updated our website to reflect that current pre-orders will not ship until August (we hope that we can scale up our production to deliver units even faster as the line gets longer).

Sorry I was off in the last shipping post!

1374431126.0,155,self.oculus,1irf90,I demoed the dev kit to 9 people not including myself; gamers and non gamers. Here are some impressions!,177,22,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1irf90/i_demoed_the_dev_kit_to_9_people_not_including/,"I got my dev kit about 3 weeks ago now and have been demoing it to many people, both gamers and non gamers. Some of them have never heard of the rift before I showed them.


**5 girls ages 18, 20, 20, 25, 37  (3 non gamers, 2 gamer)**

**4 guys ages 23, 24, 25, 45 (1 non gamer, 3 gamers)**



Female 25 gamer needs the A cup in the left eye and the B cup in the right eye and the screen pushed back 5 clicks before her eyelashes don't touch the lenses. It takes her a long time before she can find ""the sweet spot"" and it stops being a blurry mess. 


Other girls also needed the screen pushed back around 5 clicks before their eyelashes stop touching the lenses. One girl had a problem with her mascara getting all over the lenses and making everything blurry. 


Everyone else had an easy time, and most of them used the A or B cups, it took maybe 5 minutes of setup for each person. Everyone who used the A cups needed the screen pushed back 4 clicks. I use the C cups.  B cup and C cup users can have the screen in as close as possible without issue. 


Onto the demos. 


**Rift Coaster:**
Everyone seems to love the rift coaster. I usually demo it first. People report feeling tingles and a sense of vertigo when they drop. The non-gamers are far more impressed by rift coaster than gamers. This is easily the favorite for non-gamers. Rift coaster has the most problems with pixelation. 


**Ocean Rift:**
Everyone screams when the shark eats them, it's fun to watch. Female 37 non-gamer says the water feels very real. Non-gamers had issues controlling this demo, and any demo that required the controller. Many of them needed me to use the controller while they directed me vocally. 


**Titans of Space:**
This doesn't seem to get much reaction, but everyone who tries it is fascinated, they always comment on how big vy canis majoris is. The most impressive thing for them was being able to see their body. 


**Disunion:**
Only 3 people tried this one. They get a good little startle. 


**Greebles:**
Universal appeal. Everyone thinks this demo is really cool. Definitely one of the best demos out there, people look around in this demo way more than any other demo.  I have a feeling music visualizers are gonna be big on the rift. 


**Qbeh!:**
Fun little game, but the gamers I demoed it to get bored very fast with this. It's very very mildly motion sickness inducing. They usually get to level 3 before wanting to do something else. I personally think it's a cool game, but my opinion doesn't count in these impressions. 


**First Law:**
People agree it's the most 3d game. No motion sickness from this one. But people get bored fast. 


**VR Cinema:**
Everyone agreed that this was the most realistic demo. A non-gamer commented that if the screen was higher def they would never go to a movie theater again. One male 24 gamer was happy enough with the resolution that he would happily use the rift in it's current state over going to a theater. Everyone turns around to look at the projector. We have not encountered the supposed ghost. 


**Alone in the rift:**
People are mildly started when all the lights in the cabin turn off and ghost girl disappears, but nobody has screamed from that. The gamers are startled when the girl appears in front of them a couple times. The big scare at the end has people screaming very loud. I have some video of a few reactions that I may upload later. Girlfriend screamed loudest and dropped the rift on the ground.  Luckily the floor is carpeted. Male 45 non-gamer was not started at any part because he had trouble with the controls and didn't actually see the girl appear at any point because he was always facing cliffs and walking into them. The big final scare appeared above his head because he was half way up a cliff, so he only saw her feet and wasn't scared at all.  Non gamers needed me to control this for them. Everyone gamers and non-gamers had issues with controlling the flashlight. 


**Black Island:**
Unfortunately everyone was bored with this one. They played around with the monster and found it funny looking. Nobody screamed or felt startled. 


**Half life 2:**
Makes people motion sick very very fast. Only male 25 gamer had no issue with motion sickness at all throughout any demo including half life 2. People usually get started when the guards interact with them or chase them around. Half life 2 made me the most motion sick of any rift experience. People who can withstand the motion sickness long enough to look around and explore a little find the world very cool. 


**Sugeon Simulator 2013:**
It's even more fun with the rift(!) but you can't see the blood level or the blood loss rate. Other people in the room with you screaming ""he's losing blood fast!"" makes it more fun. 


And finally **Tuscany:**
I usually show this last because it makes people motion sick faster than any other demo. Only Half life 2 can induce motion sickness faster than tuscany. It's pretty but people can't stay in for more than a minute without feeling sick. 



**Notes:**

-During the first few demos people usually forget they can move their head and look around. They're so used to just looking straight at a monitor. 


-Only the male 45 non-gamer complained about the resolution. 


-The games/demos where you walk around get people the most sick. Examples: Tuscany, Half life 2, Qbeh, and Alone in the rift. 


-Games with lots of movement or where you are in a vehicle are the least motion sickness inducing. Examples: Rift Coaster, First Law, Greebles, Titans of Space


-Ocean rift is anomalous. Even though you walk around, nobody reported any motion sickness from it. 


-VR cinema has no sickness either, but you don't really walk around much in that. 


-The atmosphere in games become much more important with the rift. Things like music and ambient sound are much more important. 


-Being able to see your body (example: Titans of Space) help people feel much more immersed. People really want to be able to see their body. 


-Standing up while moving in game is very hard, but standing still and looking at an NPC next to you feels very surreal. 


-People want more and more immersion as soon as they get the rift on. They want motion controls, they want kinect, they want something like the virtuix omni and haptic feedback controllers. They feel that if total immersion can be achieved they would be happy not leaving their house anymore. 


-one person experienced headaches rather than motion sickness. 


-only 1 person tried to move their head in a way that would need positional tracking to register.

I ordered during the kickstarter and am still waiting on mine. The current game we're working on is a 2D point and Click adventure game, not a game well suited for VR, right?

I though so too, but my partner suggested this idea: It's a crazy old looking game, why not just put it on an old computer in an old room? We borrowed a friend's Rift and got down to development, and a few days later we've got a rough demo for the Rift.

It's so silly, and the Rift support is novelty at best, but I'm still finding it amusing! (Warning, if you haven't seen our game before, it covers, um... adult themes, there's no cursing, and it's mostly euphamistic, but this is probably not a kids game. Then again, they're not my kids, do what you want!)

The scale is so much more realistic in Rift.  Given the distortion you get when putting a 3D space onto a 2D monitor with traditional architectural illustration, it's clear that the Rift offers a way of exploring a design in true-to-scale and more accurate perspective than any other visualization technology or method.

(in no particular order)
Cons: 

* screen resolution is low; better screens are planned for next HMDs (everyone is already aware of that)
* the top strap doesnt really serve any purpose.
* the cable should come out of the HMD at the top I think and run along the top strap into the back of the head, the current position of the cable sometimes makes turning your head awkward.
* the current way the HMD - breakout box cable is packaged for shipping means that it is ""stiff"" after unpacking and again makes it awkward to turn your head. I think in future versions, the cable should be rolled for shipping so as to maintain flexibility.
* HMD - breakout box cable should be a bit longer.
* A way to custom order lenses should be provided in consumer versions.
* Some way to keep the lenses clean should be worked out; the time the lenses get the dirtiest is when I have the rift up on my forehead while fiddling to get things started on my main screen. Otherwise, provide a way to see ""through"" the rift to be able to see what you are doing IRL while you set things up.
* Maybe, just maybe, the brightness/contrast controls should be more accessible while wearing the rift. (like, on the rift itself, yes I know adds weight)

Pros:

* Childhood dream coming true.
* Dont have to wear glasses (C lenses in my case), was worried about that when ordering.
* Delightful head tracking.
* Wonderful stereoscopic effect.
* Case the kit came in is a nice addition.
* Cables/adapters provided in the kit made things alot easier to set up than I expected.
* Lightweight.

Now a couple personal oddities I experienced:

* The ""wow"" effect of immersion wears out but that has to be expected; basically I got used to it as being normal.
* Initially had problem coming back to reality, things felt odd, my own head movements felt abit odd and I had a sort of tetris effect of the screendoor (lasted roughly 30minutes)
* Had a problem with a Unity based demo, where at first I thought I was crosseyed and after blinking I was back to normal and could see the stereoscopic effect properly.
* Using the rift first thing in the morning makes me feel like I cant see properly into it. I feel like things are out of focus. In the evening however it is fine.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1duqz1,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1duqz1/10_days_with_the_rift_criticism/,

Hi all!

After a long weekend, I polished up a build of what I've been working on this month so everyone who has an Oculus can give it a go.  Standard disclaimer that I'm just one guy, the project is less than a month old, free time project, etc.

Anyways, if you play with it I really hope you enjoy it, and I would love feedback!

First I'd like to apologize if I was being rude or anything in the [other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/zfyvo/i_have_played_doom_3_on_the_rift_for_over_20/), I just had a lot of work in the last days and between that and my SO, I couldn't take the time to answer the questions as detailed as they deserve. I have realized now that I should have just posted the AMA when I had time and not let everybody wait. Sorry for that.

Anyway, there were some questions in the other thread that I will answer here. If you have any other questions about my 20 minute session with Doom 3 in the Rift, let me know in the comments :)

And I'm not a native english speaker, so forgive me if I'm sounding impolite or anything. I'm trying to be one of the good guys :)

### Questions from grexeo

&gt;**How does the 3D compare to 3D glasses at the cinema, or on a 3D TV?**

Let me state first that I don't like 3D movies in the cinema or on 3D TVs. Even with the best shutter 3D TVs (and in cinema in general) I have the problem with ghosting. I can always still see the image from the other eye, making the total impression a little fuzzy. Also, I tend to get headaches when watching 3D for a longer time and often take off my glasses in the cinema to enjoy the experience.

My experience with the Rift was totally different and much, much better due to the way the eyes are getting strictly separated images. It just felt totally natural. So natural in fact that I didn't notice the 3D at all after putting on the Rift. It was just as if you would put on ski googles that are showing an alternate, but still 3D, reality. My eyes didn't have to readjust, they were just taking the image for granted. After one minute or so, I remembered/realized that I am actually looking at a stereoscopic image and was astonished by the realism of the 3D. No headache either after being in the Rift for 20 minutes.

&gt;**Did you notice any tracking latency at any time?**

No, no latency. I put this to the test extensively after acclimating to the game a little. I moved my head really fast from one side to the other. It didn't lag behind at all, though the image became rather blurry when making fast turns. For me, it looked like the LCD just couldn't refresh fast enough. But this wasn't really a problem while playing, since even the fast turns in Doom 3 were still slower than the test I had done before. I am rather sensitive when it comes to latency, but I was amazed by the tracking in the Rift.

&gt;**How bad is the display ghosting?**

No ghosting at all, since both eyes are getting totally separate images.

&gt;**Did the weight of the headset make your neck feel tired after your 20+ minutes of use?**

No. That thing was *really* light. The prototypes you see in the latest videos (the black one) look much heavier than they actually are. When you take it in your hand, it feels more like an empty cardboard box than a sophisticated technical device.

&gt;**Did you feel nauseous/sick or get a headache during or after use?**

No headache at all, but I have to say that after about 10 minutes, I felt really sick in my stomach. I had eaten a rather heavy meal right before my gaming session and that made it probably much worse, but it was unpleasant. I usually don't have big problems with reading in a car or motion sickness in gaming, so this was very surprising for me. To be fair, I was standing up and putting the thing to the test, making fast turns, jumping around, standing really close to ledges, looking up and down repeatedly, using the analogue stick in different ways – so this has probably worsened the motion sickness I experienced. Also, Nate and Palmer said that they are aware of the issue and can adjust for it. For example, positional tracking should help a lot to alleviate the motion sickness problems. Also, Nate pointed out that swaying while standing as well as using the right analogue stick too much worses the motion sickness. I did both probably too much.

The nauseous feeling got worse, but sitting down felt much better. It was a little less immersive that way, but still great. It worked surprisingly well even when sitting down, which is a huge plus if you ask me: If you want to sit down in your living room and relax, you can – and still get an immersive experience.

The nauseous feeling stopped about 10 minutes after playing, but I felt a little woozy for about 2 hours.

&gt; **Did the level of immersion cause you to lean or start to fall over when moving?**

I swayed back and forth unintentionally, because my sense of balance was tricked by the amazing illusion. Actually, my first thought after putting on the Rift was: ""I wanna start walking."" But I didn't fall over or anything. I guess I managed quite okay, since Nate and Palmer were having their lunch during my session in the Rift, not standing beside me like they had to with other people in some of the videos. Or maybe they were just way too hungry :D

&gt; **People complain that the pixels are noticeable. Did you notice them? And if so, was it for the entire 20 minutes, or did you brain manage to ignore the low resolution quickly?**

I saw the low resolution only in the first moments after putting on the Rift. I noticed them, focused at them and thus noticed them even more. It looks a little as if you were standing really close to a TV and see the red, yellow and blue dots. But when I turned my attention to the game, my brain just edited them out due to the motion on the screen. Once you focus on the game and not the screen itself, the effect kind of vanishes and you see only the game. Really immersive.

&gt; **What did you think of using a console controller as the input method? Did you find it frustrating or a natural match?**

I felt it was a natural match. I guess that having an actual motion-sensor gun in your hand would be even more immersive. But I can imagine that it would be very tiring to hold a gun in your hands for a longer amount of time. Carmack has done a good job with the controls, decoupling the up/down-look of the weapon from the head was a clever idea and makes using a controller an acceptable and convenient choice.

&gt; **Are you primarily a PC or console gamer?**

PC gamer by heart :) I play primarily with mouse and keyboard, since I don't like that controller aiming is less precise. But since I aimed with my head and had much better precision there anyway, I found that the controller for moving is a great substitute. 

&gt; **Would you describe yourself as a VR enthusiast or just an average gamer?**

I play lots of games, but this was the first HMD I have worn, so I am probably not a VR enthusiast. Well, I *was* not an enthusiast. Because after reading everything about the Rift and trying it finally, I definitely believe that this will be the future of gaming. I believe in the potential, let's pray that this takes off the way we all hope it does.


### Questions from onetown

&gt; **What was most awesome about it?**

The immersion in general was absolutely fantastic. The combination of high FOV and perfect tracking makes you feel like you are totally in the game. The most awesome moment was when I was standing really close to a railing and moved my head down to look into the abyss below. I actually felt the height, giving me goosebumps and prompting me to take a step back in the game instinctively. The game tricked me into a subconscious decision, which was pretty mind-shattering and awesome at the same time.

&gt; **What do you thinkthey need to improve?**

Besides the motion sickness problems I mentioned above, I actually cannot think of anything that really bugged me. The experience was simply amazing, I never had an immersive gaming experience like this before – and it was only a prototype. Resolution could be higher, but as I mentioned before, you only notice that when you really look for it and it should be fixed in the consumer version.

### Questions from Sh1ner

&gt; **Did you use a controller to implement rotation of the character?**

Yup. You can either rotate your head or use the stick to turn your body.

&gt; **Did you feel comfortable with the control scheme using the rift?**

Absolutely. Aiming with your head takes out so much hassle with other controls, since you don't have to focus on the aiming, that happens instinctively.

&gt; **Were you still competent at killing monsters or does the goggles slow down the pace of the game?**

I was blasting away imps like I was SuperSergeant MacBlaskowicz! :) The Rift doesn't slow down the game at all, it was actually a bit too fast-paced for my taste, probably causing some of the motion sickness problems I mentioned above.

&gt; **What is your opinion of trying to play a shooter with the rift and kb + mouse?**

I guess that it would lead to some problems, since fast turning with the mouse would probably make you sick after a short time. But it probably depends on the speed of the game. Skyrim or other RPGs should be alright, shooters may be trickier to play with Mouse and Keyboard due to the high amount of moving.

&gt; **How was the tracking?**

Perfect, see question 2 above for the longer answer.

&gt; **Did it veer off one of the axis at any point?**

I thought that there was a slight drift after my 20 minutes, but I'm not sure. I had the impression that the view was a little crooked to the left side at the end, but it was only the slightest bit.

### Questions from King6six

&gt; **Do you wear glasses? If so did you put them aside while playing and anything you noticed how your experience was affected?**

No, I don't wear glasses, but in some of the recent videos people with bad eyesight played with the Rift. The general consensus was that as long as you don't have *very bad* eyesight, you should be fine. Also, you can wear contacts in the Rift.

**That's it, I hope you enjoyed my impressions with the Rift.** If you have any more questions, just shoot them here in the comments!

(Description within!)",103,5,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1g964g/tried_evevr_today_at_e3_best_rift_experience_yet/,"While I'm still waiting for my kit to arrive, I have messed around with a friend's Rift a few times. But today while at E3 (I'm a developer for a AAA studio) I was able to snag a play through of the EVE-VR demo in the CCP meeting room. (Not on the show floor.)

Without a doubt, it is the best experience I've had yet on the Rift.

Because it is naturally dark (you are in space) the screen door effect is incredibly minimized. The ship's cockpit is fully realized, including the leather seat you sit on - as they encourage you to look behind you while being fired upon.

This was clearly designed by a team who understands the ""rules"" of developing for VR, because the integration was near flawless. (I only had one complaint and it was minor - we'll get to that.) But first, the good stuff.

First, there is a body sitting in the cockpit if you look down, so you don't have the floating head syndrome. I immediately re-positioned my legs to match my avatar's and it was like my brain settled into a comfortable place. Weird how that works.

Second, the primary fire is a standard laser, but the secondary fire is a work of pure brilliance. Holding the left trigger (we used an Xbox controller) a reticle appears in the middle of your view. This allows your free look to become your aiming device - and once you lock on to another ship (by looking at it,) you let go of the trigger to fire a barrage of heat-seaking missles at them, regardless of the direction your ship is facing. This allows you to pilot and fire your weapons independently which is dynamic and feels very natural; and it encourages you to constantly look around.

Space is a natural setting for Rift titles because there is technically no ""up,"" and being able to use already arted EVE assets helps enhance the experience dramatically. There was a huge ship in the middle of the map, and flying low across it's wide surface was quite a moment for me in terms of scale and detail. I actually forgot people were shooting at me because I was so wrapped up in the experience. I wanted nothing more than to just sail off and explore the universe.

My only criticism was the death screen. To be fair, it was minimal: the screen went black, and some white text appeared that resembled a DOS screen rebooting. Within a few seconds you were back in the hangar, being ejected into space again to rejoin the fight. It didn't last long, but it was enough to pull you out of the moment. I would have preferred the ""rebooting"" sequence to happen on your immediately respawned ship's monitors.

The Audio was as fantastic as the visuals, despite this being nothing more than an early prototype.

And that's what is most impressive. The team at CCP didn't spend a lot of time on this, and yet it is an amazing experience with an incredibly strong foundation. There are currently no plans to turn this into an actual project - unless the hype starts to really build on this.

So this is my meager attempt to help start that!

Thanks for the read, I hope some of you found it interesting! I'll certainly respond to any questions about my experience as best I can if there are any.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1g964g,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1g964g/tried_evevr_today_at_e3_best_rift_experience_yet/,

As far as I know, the first hardcore rift demo around. 

Yeah. So this is best viewed laying down, but propped up a little. You'll find the sweet spot. 

I had no idea how to use either a 3d modeling program or Unity before I received my Oculus Rift Friday evening, so this is a very rough demo. But I haven't seen any real porn for the rift. So I had to make my own. Took a good 10 hours or so. The other twenty were blowing my mind in rift.

It seems that eye contact is incredibly powerful in VR, something that triggers different instinctual responses depending on the context.  A friendly gaze can put you at ease, a stone cold face can make you look away, and a glare can make you flinch.  

Oddly enough, though, I have been unable to find many examples of eye contact in videogames, particularly multiplayer titles.  It seems like such an easy thing to do (Just snap the eyes of any player looking near you to your face), but it rarely is.  Mass Effect does this with NPCs to great, well, effect!

Rifter from Tokyo here (A Tokyo Rifter... ha!) Just got my Rift this weekend and have been having a blast with it. Let's get some standard stuff out of the way first:

* Sure, the screen door effect is present, but I find it only barely registers with me under most circumstances. What it tends to affect is complex geometry and details displayed in the distance, and most demos do a good job of limiting that.
* The ghosting effect only tends to affect me when text is involved. I don't tend to notice it much otherwise.
* Fogging of lenses did not occur with me, but my girlfriend and friend both experienced a little. Likely because they were hot and somewhat sweating (summer in Tokyo is cruel)
* At first I found it hard to put on the headset so that I was getting as clear a view as possible. Moving it slightly up and down results in a slight light-bleed from objects. After the first day I became completely adept at affixing the headset so I had a nice clear view.
* The head tracking is simply perfect. I hear some people talking about input lag or a feeling of delay when moving your head. But **I have not experienced any tracking lag what-so-ever.** Maybe I'm less observant than others... and if so, I'm glad, because I think the tracking is exquisite!
* On a humorous note: I've watched a number of ""reaction"" videos to the Riftcoaster demo. Now I very much regret not recording my girlfriend. She screamed and clawed at the seat like a mad-woman. It was the single most hilarious thing I've ever seen!

Moving on... I haven't seen much in the way of a consolidated list of user-created playable demos. So I'm going to concentrate mostly on what I thought about the various software that's out right now (in alphabetical order). This is not an exhaustive list. I feel as though I've hand-picked what I thought were the most interesting demos currently available. I'm more than happy to receive suggestions for other games! Especially cool ""outside the box"" stuff (i.e, not FPS).

*P.S:* Almost all of these demos can be found on the Oculus Developer Forums, and/or even on this subreddit. I don't want to link directly as I'd like people to go to the source.

**Alone in the Rift:**  Terrifying. I lack the Hydra controller, so had to resort to a regular 360 controller. Even so, it was one of the most mentally visceral horror experiences I have ever encountered. And I've played my fair share! (Amnesia, Call of Cthulhu, Penumbra etc) I actually had to remove the Rift part-way through as I couldn't deal with it!


**Anteword:**  A completely virtual Earth. There's a lot of detail going on, but sadly there are no cities etc. But it's quite a rush to zoom around mountains etc. It'd be nice if they gave full controllability for the 360 controller. Currently the easiest control method is with a mouse. Not a problem.

**Blue Marble:**  A very nice space 'autopilot'. The music adds a nice touch, as does the ability to add your own songs. If I could loop the demo I'd stay in there for hours.

**Darkfield:**  This was one of the games that actually made me say ""wow"". A space-fighter sim with just the right amount of ""arcade"" inertia. Flying close to asteroids and looking around in the cockpit was a real rush. It made me genuinely excited about the upcoming Star Citizen game. Space sims + Rift = Amazing.

**Fantasy Night:**  Just a simple demo with cat-girls, fireworks and water. Ok, a little random, but it's it's a nice leisurely introduction to VR for those who are trying it for the very first time.

**First Law:**  Another space-fighter sim. The inertia is awful, but the ability to spawn enemies and then follow them around with your head, independant of the craft actually made me feel like a fighter-pilot.

**Museum of the Micro-star:**  A self-guided tour around a very detailed fictional 'museum of the future'. Comes complete with a cool back-story and voice-over. This one eventually gave me a bit of motion sickness. Really nice 3D effect. Walking up to the signs and exhibitions actually made me jerk my head back a little.

**Unity Tuscany Demo:**  Pretty standard. Nothing that great to be honest. The other demos gave far better impressions IMO.

**Pagani Huayra:**  Sweet detailed interior of the new Pagani car. Impressive. Would be awesome if you could get out and walk the outside of it. Or stay inside and at least drive around a little :D

**Parrot Coaster:**  An awesome roller-coaster guaranteed to make you feel queasy. However it also provided a far better feeling of speed and drop when compared to the classic ""Riftcoaster"". Do it once, don't go around a second time unless you want to lay down for an hour afterwards.

**Planet 1:**  Flying around a fictional planet in a some-what awkward to control ship. Drop out of the ship into a surface rover, and then get out of the surface rover to walk around. Pretty cool. The controls forced me to give up early on.

**Proton Pulse:**  Two words. A-fucking-mazing. An old break-out style game re-imagined in VR. Completely intuitive controls, all controlled by your head. Awesome music and retro visuals. Easily one of the best demos out right now.

**Qbeh:**  A 1st person puzzler. Very cool. Suffers from the same motion problems that other FPS demos have. You can use your head to change direction, but eventually you need to realign by using the mouse or controller, which really messes your sense of direction.

**Riftcoaster:**  The classic rollercoaster. I demoed this for my girlfriend and her two friends, they all went bananas. Wish I could figure out how to increase the detail even further.

**SNES9X (VR Edition):**  Playing old-school SNES titles through what feels like a gigantic virtual window. Pretty darn cool. Works with any SNES rom you might have.

**Spacewalk:**  A nice relaxing fly around the International Space Station. The spacesuit lends a nice touch but I found it a little finnicky when flying around using the thrusters.

**Titans of Space:**  This is easily the epitome of demos for me. Not for any particular technical achievement, but because I'm obsessed with space and the universe, and this simply blew my mind. I understood the scales of the planets/sun etc, but this put it into a completely new perspective. When they start introducing the sizes of other known stars... wwwwwwoah.

**Under Current:** A trek under the ocean. Sorta similar to Planet 1. You pilot a craft underwater, then you can drop out and explore on foot. I found it a little rough around the edges, but overall it was still a nice experience.

**UPROCKN:**  A procedurally generated voxel world. Rough around the edges... but you can use a laser to burn holes in the ground, or to fill them back up. Controls are a little problematic but it took me back to the old days of Red Faction, so I give it a thumbs up.

**Utopia Planitia - Enterprise Bridge:**  I'm not into Star Trek at all, but if this bridge became more interactive, perhaps with some nicer lighting and some characters walking around? I'd probably sit in that captains seat and pretend to bark orders for hours at a time :D

**VR Cinema:**  This was one of the other demos that made me go ""wow"". The ambient lighting that spills out from the movie adds a massive amount of immersion. *Imagine* if this became a multiplayer experience with a streaming video going on. You and your friends from all over the world could meet up in this theater and watch a freakin' movie together! Add in a little voice chat so people can munch popcorn, and a laser pointer feature and it'd be a pretty accurate movie theater experience.

~~Note that I haven't mentioned HL2, Dear Esther, TF2, Portal 2, Mirrors Edge or any of the other ""full"" games. HL2 does seem nice, once you can get the Vireio configuration just right. Dear Esther is pretty damn astonishing. But honestly I think people should be giving more attention to these user creations, as these are the people who are trying to make extremely Rift-tailored experiences, and are so far doing a bang-up job.~~

Anyway, hope this list helps people!

**Edit:** Formatting etc.

**Edit #2:** After a request below I've decided to include impressions of HL2, Dear Esther and Skyrim.

**Half-life 2:** The built in VR support is really something. The difference between Vireio and native VR is apparent from the beginning, mostly in the ways that you can aim &amp; navigate. After transferring my Rift settings from the TF2 config file, everything came alive. As mentioned above, the aiming/movement system is probably the best feature that native VR gives. It's rather akin to TF2's setup; [In aiming mode 3] If your physical head is aligned with the crosshair, then moving the mouse will allow a certain degree of gun movement without moving your entire view around (good for those who get sick easily). Once the crosshair reaches a certain limit, your body and view will start to move. However at any point you can ""unlock"" your head and move it wherever you wish, after which you can bring your crosshair back in to current view by moving it enough. The 3D effect is just right, for me it's not on par with a well made Unity demo, but it's damned close, and the sense of polish and atmosphere easily washes out any other issues.

**Dear Esther:** This one requires the Vireio drivers, but once you're adept at configuring them (and for me, that took a lot of time) the 3D effect and scale is really quite sometime. Put it this way: I was fully immersed in DE the very first time I played it on a regular screen in a darkened room. So much so that I had a friend with me at the time and neither of us talked the entire way through, at which point we both just said ""...wow"". With the addition of the Rift, I was fully enraptured by this game. The audio, visuals and narration are a perfect example of a non-Rift game managing to feel like a custom Rift title.

**Skyrim:** Oh Skyrim, you fat bloated old sow. Last time we parted ways it was on bitter terms, as you had decided that allowing any sort of mod to run was simply ""not your cup of tea"". What an asshole. Thankfully mods have come leaps and bounds since then, and I had no issue installing visual upgrades and *~ahem~* skimpy clothing mods in to the game. What completely stumped me was daisy-chaining the Vireio drivers to ENB's dx9 image tweaks. I tried and tried, and tried some more. Eventually I gave up and decided (not bitter at all) that I'd rather have increased FPS than increased visual quality. Vireio setup proved particularly cumbersome on this one, as for some reason the usually slow movement of the Separation lines suddenly increased to warp-speed, making it very difficult to get everything exact. In the end I gave up and simply duplicated the Vireio cfg settings I had previously set for Dear Esther. It wasn't perfect, but it gave a good starting point from which I was able to get it *just right*. The result was pretty spectacular. With the appropriate mods, characters are extremely high fidelity, and it was almost eerie to see my old in-game character in 3D. The effort to get this game working was worth it. Certainly the visuals are some of the best demonstratable on the Rift so far. That is... until Far Cry 3 finally gets true Vireio support!",,False,self,t5_2uni5,1375142445.0,,,True,t3_1gwvrm,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1gwvrm/oculus_rift_game_demo_impressions_one_long/,

Edit: I will keep this up to date, having issues loading pages as i'm certain most of you are as well.

Edit 2: Please also note that if I accidentally add a game that isn't completely compatible let me know and I will mark it for reference purposes.

Edit 3: Ok I need to go back to homework (its due at midnight). I promise to check back every hour on the hour until this steam summer camp thing is over. ((Not counting my sleeping hours which is 10-7)) CDT

Edit 4: Special shout out to [nikropht](http://www.reddit.com/user/nikropht) for doing a stand up job in helping me set this up. 

Edit 5: If you are curious about more compatible games check out [RiftEnabled](http://www.riftenabled.com/) courtesy of: [ohmk](http://www.reddit.com/user/ohmk)

Edit 6: Removed Counter Strike: Source, it does not have any known support. 

Edit 7: **NOTE** [apieceoffruit](http://www.reddit.com/user/apieceoffruit)
&gt;you need to add a note to say that 90% of those games DONT WORK with the oculus NOW games like flight suit, miner wars, euro truck etc none of those will be playable right now if someone (like me 5min ago cough) tried to play them....
(the ones mentioned above have promised support down the line)

Edit 8: **NOTE** [deletemeapril162014](http://www.reddit.com/user/deletemeapril162014)
&gt;It's worth noting that Vireio is currently in a period of change, and that nearly all of the games you cited above no longer work with it. Skyrim specifically no longer works with Vireio, and the Dirt games work only after massive amounts of configuration. Most Source games (esther, dishonored, etc) still work.

I've mocked up a picture of what it looks like from my point of view, in the hope it will give people a better idea and maybe temper some expectations.

When looking at the second picture, the best way to achieve the same effect is to move close enough to the screen so the image fills the top and bottom of your field of view, and hold hands against your head like the sides of ski goggles. It's also worth noting that inside the actual rift you can see slightly more around the edges by rotating your eyeballs, but it affects your field of view and is slightly blurrier than looking straight ahead.

[An unaltered screenshot of the Tuscany demo](http://i.imgur.com/MERHA4A.jpg)

[Roughly what it looks like inside the Rift](http://i.imgur.com/8WnDnmt.jpg)

There's a few caveats to this: due to different IPDs, lenses and internal distance other people could see more or less than what I perceive inside the Rift. For comparison purposes, my IPD is 62mm, using type A lenses, with the adjustment dials set to the middle on both sides.

It's also worth noting that while the above picture may look underwhelming, the experience you have is still very immersive due to the responsive motion tracking, stereoscopy and field of view.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,1367591568.0,,,True,t3_1dm536,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1dm536/approximation_of_what_it_looks_like_inside_the/,

Definitely go and throw some money at this brilliant project. I've been following it on the mtbs3d forums for a long time and I believe it really has the potential to not just be some VR movie theatre app, but a proto Street - a default online hangout for rifters. 

Also, if you pay at the $30 level, you get early access to the software and a picture of one of his dogs wearing a rift. C'mon

OpenHMD aims to provide a Free and Open Source API and drivers for immersive technology, such as head mounted displays with built in head tracking. The only supported device at the moment, however, is the Oculus Rift (SDK).

In its current state it's quite usable to play around with, especially in Linux. Just clone our github repo and compile it (instructions in the README).

Once we hit a numbered release (should be pretty soon, the coming week probably) we'll provide pre-built packages for Debian/Ubuntu, Windows and Os X.

Suggestions regarding API design and implementation are welcome.

Let's talk about it.",94,12,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1gj6gf/im_a_sound_designercomposer_rogue_legacy/,"I work full time as a sound designer and composer but none of my projects yet include the Oculus,  which is constantly on my mind because I make a LOT of binaural recordings. I want to connect with people/programmers interested in integrating HRTF and convolution verb to make truly immersive games--not just visually immersive.  But first let's talk about it.  

Edit: I guess instead of sitting around waiting for questions, I can do some explainin'.  

Binaural audio is created with something called a head-related transfer function, which is basically a mapping of your head as a frequency filter. (for fun [here is a video of me explaining it in the most basic of ways on Machu Picchu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0uGsAksBaY)).  

High frequencies do not penetrate mass as well as lower frequencies.  Sound waves also take time to travel, so there is a time delay from one ear to the other which is how we discern positioning of a sound source.  Our head also brings in factors of diffraction. So if a sound happens on our left, our right ear not only hears it later but also hears an entirely different sound. Incorporated with the reflections/delay of a room, we can discern a ton of information about an environment with our ears.  By closing your eyes and clapping your hands you can tell whether the room you're in has a carpet, windows, concrete walls or even other people.  Try it.  

As far as development for the Oculus my dream is that not only will real-time binaural audio be prevalent ([this](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1fs64c/binarial_audio_with_unity3d/) video posted today is hugely promising, except that Unity's audio implementation middleware isn't very good and must be coupled with Wwise or custom engineered for anything dynamic or complex).  But reverb that interplays with the user's voice--imagine not only hearing your game-created footsteps in your environment, but you own voice echoing through a virtual canyon in real time. The implications are incredible.

Following up to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1aeamx/things_to_do_with_your_oculus_rift_dev_kit_on_day/) I made a few weeks ago!

--Setting up the Rift, Tiny Room, Tuscany Demo, VR Player, Oculus Street View, WebGL Minecraft clone, Steve D's videos, and the Virtual Cinema videos  
   
[Impressions Video Part 2](http://youtu.be/9qqH_L8H-7s)  
--Getting my mind blown by Museum of the Microstar, Virtual Boy emulator VBjin-OVR, overall impressions  
  
  
I tried out a bunch of software, web pages, and SBS 3D videos.  
  
I am most impressed by the sense of scale - it really must be seen to be believed. Game designers can now access a part of the human psyche that was untouchable before.  
  
Strangely, I am most excited about Virtual Cinema. That has huge mass market potential. While in the Rift, the screen is HUGE. A high res screen and quality earphones would literally transform the Rift into a ""movie theater in a box."" Who needs a big screen TV?

I know quite a few of us are still waiting for dev kits, so if you have questions or specific things you would like me to try, let me know. I hope my experience and information will make you better prepared for your dev kit!  
  
Ever Forward,

I'd say it is the best gaming experience currently available.  It reminds me of the first time I played Quake 1 with a 3DFX card.  Just, wow.  Intense, beautiful, and gratifying.

I've had my Rift for almost two months now, and for the first time it feels like more than a dev kit.  It feels like a product and an experience.  For me, totally worth $300.  For those of you still waiting, it will be so worth the wait.

I had my IPD measured professionally today, I have HL2 all set up, and I am well VR acclimated.  For me, avoiding nausea is all about how I use the right stick (using vr_viewaim_mode 0).

I forgot how amazing this game is.  They got immersion mostly right the first time around so the transition to VR is fairly seamless (as long as you close your eyes during the loading screen!)  The design of this game is pure genius.

Higher resolution, positional tracking, and hand tracking would make this experience just breath-taking.

http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1i9qmt/341_hrs_later_cowgirl_nsfw/

As rough (and I mean rough) as these two demos are, I think the potential of the Oculus has not been underestimated by the industry. Two of the biggest names in 3d adult games, ThriXXX and Illusion have already caught on:

So I whipped up a plugin that lets Firefox and Chrome access the Oculus Rift and Razer Hydra. It's fast and (I think) pretty easy to make existing WebGL content compatible. It provides both the raw sensor data and helpers for doing all of the math and even drawing WebGL scenes with the distortion/chromatic aberration correction shaders.

Currently it requires downloading the repo zip and running a batch file, but in the future if I get good feedback I'll create Chrome Web Store and Mozilla Addons versions that are easier for non-developers to get.

1368725081.0,74,self.oculus,1egmr3,My thoughts on the Rift,82,8,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1egmr3/my_thoughts_on_the_rift/,"It's really, honestly, like nothing else. I have never truly thought this about any game peripheral until this, but: this changes everything. EVERYTHING. The amount and breadth of applications that this could be used for is breathtaking. But, it has its fair share of flaws.

The biggest flaw in it, at the moment, is the screen. Once that is upgraded there won’t be a real, solid complaint about the device itself. The good news there is that Oculus knows this, they knew it from day one, but they wanted to get an affordable solution out the door so people could begin using and designing/developing with it. In house, they apparently have been playing with a bunch of different displays and are trying to figure out what will work best for DevKit2 and upgrades to DevKit1. The DevKit is designed so that you can easily replace and upgrade parts in it, so it’s only a matter of time.

So, the current screen…
The pixel density could be better, and that is important, so, higher resolution/tighter pixel density is a must (it is currently 1280x800, split between two eyes, so 640x800 per eye). One of the hotly talked about replacement screens for it is the screen from the upcoming Nexus 7 tablet. Pulling a display out of that would be a solid upgrade and would basically be a plug and play upgrade, which is a big thing. The physical size matters almost as much as the resolution does, as it needs to have the same field of view, weight, etc. So, upgrading the resolution/pixel density is a big deal, but that’s just for eye candy immersion. Way more important than that is the refresh rate; it's just too slow on the current display. After about 20 seconds of using the Rift, you begin to see beyond the “dead space” in between the pixels, and the gridwork sort of disappears. Your brain just doesn’t care about that and it essentially amounts to “dirty glasses”. You realize how immersive it is, and you just forget about that. 

Another issue with the display deals with relative-to-eye movements. Michael Abrash talks in great technical detail about this (specifically in regards to Head Mounted Displays like the Rift) in an article here: http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/abrash/why-virtual-isnt-real-to-your-brain/
Essentially, it breaks down like this: in the real world when we turn our heads, we naturally will keep our eyes fixated on objects. Similarly, we will often look at an object off to our side, then turn our heads to catch up with our eyes. Doing either of these actions with the Rift on will cause the display to shift/rotate in front of our eyes. This yields another flaw in the display (that happens at the same time as the motion blur/refresh rate flaw…but I’ll get to that in a minute): color artifacting. This is something that was a lot more common in LCOS displays than it is in current LCD displays, but it is still an issue to some degree. Essentially what happens is that, as the pixels alternate between red, green and blue (something we would normally never see, as our brain would interpret the image as a whole, vs. individual pixels due to our distance from the screen and the relative resolution), if the display shifts in front of our eyes (for one of the previously mentioned reasons) we will occasionally see color fringing and other artifacts. It happens over the span of milliseconds, and many people may not notice it because of how immersed they are, but the longer you are in the Rift, the more apparent these things can be. As you get used to the controls and movements, you start doing things faster, and more naturally. At that point is when these things will show up, as you may be running/strafing and turning your head at the same time, meanwhile trying to lock your eyes on objects. Seeing color fringing is unnatural, and when it shows up, your brain tells you “No, this isn’t right”, that can add to motion sickness and, generally, just pull you out of the experience a bit.

As I hinted at above, the slower refresh rate will cause a slight motion blur. This happens as you turn your head, which is another big cause of getting motion sickness. Most people will get used to it after a few longer sessions in the Rift (getting your “Rift Legs”?), and it’s not that bad for most people in general, but some simply cannot handle it. It pulls them out of the immersion, reminding them they have a device strapped to their head. For gamers, it’s probably not as big a deal, as we are used to moving and looking around, strafing and looking off to the side. The fact that we are using our head instead of joysticks or WASD and a mouse to do that doesn’t really change much. I found myself playing as I normally would using a mouse and keyboard, looking straight ahead, and it felt normal. The head tracking really just felt like an addition to that movement. It felt much more natural. I could be running forward and turn to look at something to my side, or look down at “my” feet or weapon. In games where the head tracking wasn’t independent of the body movements (turning my head to the left while running forward meant I would start running in the direction I was looking), I felt the greatest disconnect. It didn’t feel right, neither from a gamers perspective nor a real world perspective. That’s the strange thing about the Rift, is it can feel truly different than anything we are used to. It can also feel like an extension of normality, but until game designers really get a grasp on it and start utilizing it in natural feeling ways, whether to gamers or non-gamers, it is going to have some serious flaws in its “feel”. 

So, display flaws and the “feel” being wrong (in certain instances) both suck, but, you can get used to them. It may not be ideal, and it may feel weird, but you can get used to it. Both of those are problems that can be fixed easily. Slap in a new display with a fast refresh rate and a tighter pixel density and you get rid of motion blur and the dead space between pixels. With a higher quality display, with tighter pixel density, color artifacting caused by relative-to-eye movements will also be minimized (as our perception of these “events” will be lowered).

Another thing I have an issue with is the Field Of View for specific things. It comes down to how your eyes perceive the digital world inside the rift, and how we currently design the layouts for games. For example, we normally associate a chat bar with being at the bottom/bottom-left side of our screens. That’s where it normally is in games and we are used to it. But, you can not have a chat bar at the bottom-left of the screen in the Rift. It just doesn’t work. Your eyes will be strained, causing the text to be hard to read. Also, because of how our peripheral vision works, you will never be able to quickly/casually read what is written down there anyways, you will have to pull away from your immersive experience to read the chat box. Not only will this get your character killed in most games, it causes your brain to go “woah, that’s not normal, stop that”. Write something on a piece of paper, look at the center of your screen and put that piece of paper in the bottom left of your field of view. Keep your head looking at the screen and turn your eyes to look at the paper. Yeah, exactly. It sucks. 

So, to me, there are two fixes to this. The first fix is to make the chat box and/or hud move relative to your head. Imagine your hud physically floating in front of your character. Turn your head down to the left, and the chat box repositions up to the center of your vision. Look down to the right and you can see your current ammo and health. If you turn your characters body, the HUD floats with you. Another way to think of this is to imagine yourself inside a large helmet with a visor. You can still turn your head to look at different parts inside the helmet, but the pieces of that helmet will still stay relative to your body/suit, where it is attached. 
The second fix is to understand that humans don’t have/use HUD’s in the real world, so it will always feel unnatural in an immersive setting. It pulls you away from the experience and makes you think “this isn’t real, words don’t magically float in front of my face in real life”. Designers need to start using the physical environment and physical character in the game to display these key items. For example, the Pip Boy from the Fallout franchise. If when you look down at your character he/she would raise their arm and show the chat, health and ammo in a device on the characters arm, it would feel normal. We have and use gadgets every day, and to see this wouldn’t pull us out of the game. Another example could be the character pulling a phone out of their pocket and looking at it. These events could be tied to head movements, or, tied to motion detection devices on our bodies, say, a wristwatch sized device. Playing with a mouse and keyboard, then lifting your hand up off the mouse as you look down to check stats at a glance would feel natural and intuitive to us, because these are already motions we use in real life. In games with a cockpit/vehicle, you could put this information on the “dashboard” of the physical environment. Not only would this make use of what is traditionally “fluff” design space, it would add to the immersion of being there. Feeling like a pilot or a driver. I’ve never had much of a desire to play a flight simulator, it just never appealed to me. But with the rift, and with proper immersion into the sim, I might find it appeals in a big way. The feeling of actually being there completely changes how you view the environment you are in, in-game. 
I played Minecraft last night with the Rift on (and the awesome mod developed by user StellaArtois found here: http://www.mtbs3d.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=140&amp;t=17146 ), and I found myself viewing the game and the world in a completely different way. Being able to look down at my tool as I change from a pickaxe to a sword feels so natural, yet it is something I have never done in game before; I would just look at my hotbar and scroll the wheel or hit a corresponding number button. I wandered around, looking up at these super structures and finally thinking “wow, that is immense!”. I had never felt scale in Minecraft before, not truly. You might be up on top of a huge building in survival mode, building up and reciting your mantra “don’t fall, don’t fall, don’t fall”, but the only reason you didn’t want to fall was because your character would die and you would have to run back and pick up your stuff. You didn’t want to fall because of the hassle. With the Rift on, you don’t want to fall because your brain is telling you that you will die. But, like many people standing on the edge of a great fall to their certain death, The Call Of The Void beckons. The freedom to jump, because you can tell yourself “it’s just a game”, is a strange feeling, and I think that the applications for getting over fears or learning new things, experiencing new things, is another really strong point of the Rift and VR in general. But the big key to that is immersion. Without proper, and natural feeling, immersion, those things just won’t have the same impact (note: I do not want to feel the impact of hitting the ground).

So, games need to start being made differently. That’s clear to anyone who has used the Rift, I would imagine. The entire experience is immersive and otherworldly, transporting us to game worlds we’ve seen hundreds of times, that we are familiar with, and still making us go “wow! I’m really here!”. Yet, throughout the wow factor, there is always a nagging feeling of “this doesn’t feel right”. That’s not to say it never will, but right now, it’s still a bit off. The great news is that all of these problems can be fixed, and in simple ways. I see a huge amount of potential in the Rift, and in its current incarnation I am already experiencing games in new and interesting ways. I have become more aware of game environments and design choices, and it gives me all kinds of ideas for motion controls and augmented reality and so on. I feel like I am experiencing these game worlds for the first time ever, and that is an exciting feeling for someone who has been a dedicated and huge gamer for 20-some years.

Just like many of you, I find myself with a case of ""Rift Fever"" and cannot stop thinking about finally receiving my dev kit. I put together a list of the things I will do, play, and test out once it arrives. I thought I would share:  
  
THE WEEK(S) BEFORE THE DEV KIT ARRIVES:
  
Download and install the [Oculus SDK](http://www.oculusvr.com/developer/) as soon as possible. DONE!  
  
Read all SDK documentation. (Awesome so far, so much detail!)
  
Watch [Sword Art Online.](http://www.crunchyroll.com/sword-art-online) DONE! (Good lord I watched all 25 episodes in a row, what is wrong with me... XD)  
  
Read Ready Player One.

Read Snow Crash.

Read Neuromancer. 

Download and install the Oculus Custom UDK. Port my files over to the new version.  
  
Release a demo of what I am working on for current dev kit owners to try.
  
ONCE IT ARRIVES:  
  
Check out some default [UDK](http://www.unrealengine.com/udk/) levels, like Epic Citadel, Foliage Map, DM-Deck, and Necropolis.  ~~If the Oculus SDK works with the free version of [Unity](http://unity3d.com/), I'll check that out too.~~  
  
Check out some of the simple things I will have created in UDK, like a beach or a replica of the empty [holodeck.](http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Holodeck.jpg)  [Work-in-Progress video 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK2dDAcJ45Y); [Video 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS1AUtFwQh8)

Wow!,79,8,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1fiypo/just_had_a_go_with_the_rift_for_the_first_time_wow/,"The cool thing about the stereoscopic 3D is that you don't ""notice"" it. It's just a fact, and you just really get a sense of scale and 3D positioning. I noticed the ""screen door effect"" pretty well, but with better panels in the future version that shouldn't be a problem at all. The main problem isn't mainly the amount of pixels available, it's the space between them that makes it so apparent. You do look ""through"" it and into the world though! Fast movement = ghosting though, so it smears out a bit.

I tried several unity demos and HL2 Ep. 2, and TF2. The head tracking becomes so second nature that whenever it's not present it just becomes weird somehow.

I am really impressed, although i hope that the new panel they'll eventually introduce will be significantly better to look at.

I think devs will need to focus more on that central area of the screen, so most of the action happens there without big things getting in your way. I noticed many things are unnaturally big and beefy in games, and this was really apparent in VR! 
Things happening near the edge of the screen is out of view. You pretty much can't see the weapon select in HL2, for example.

I would like to see a brighter or higher contrast screen, and the colour saturation is a little pale too, most likely due to the resolution.

Playing TF2 was kinda confusing, and I felt like I wanted a wider field of view, as everything seemed to crowd my view. Control schemes are confusing too, and takes a lot of getting used to. You'll have to get used to high mouse sensitivity to be efficient, as turning is slow if you don't. 

A ""fat"" and fast game like TF2 doesn't seem to be well suited to something like the rift in general, really.

HL2, however, was great. Still felt like I was a little too ""close"" to everything, but it's more realistic in proportions and stuff, so things didn't seem to crowd my view in the same way as TF2 did.

One problem I had was that the lenses would fog up from breathing out of my nose. Adjusting placement and everything really carefully did the trick, but I think it should be sealed with padding over the bridge of the nose so the space you're breathing in is more separated from the inside of the rift.

**If you're using vireio, make sure to set the console variable ""vr_vireio 1"" or you'll get screen freezing and other issues.**

Highlights include:

* Redesigned HUD.

* All weapon models have been rebuilt to be viewable from any angle.

* vr_flashlight_mode (0|1|2) - Attaches the flashlight to 0:head, 1:right hand, 2:left hand.

* vr_hydra_left_hand (0|1) - Purely experimental at this point. 0 is default, 1 is positional tracking.

* Working crossbow scope (See below!)

**Rough guide to using HLVR**

Once it's installed, if you restart steam, it should be on your games list but there are a couple of other things required:

* Run Vireio and select Oculus Rift rendering, but No Tracking.

* Copy the Half-LifeVR.mce that was installed to your *\Steam\SteamApps\SourceMods\halflife-vr* directory into the *MotionCreator 2\configs* directory, then run or refresh Motion Creator and force the HLVR config on.

Ideally you should only have to recalibrate the tracking once when you start playing, but because of drift and stuff, you may have to redo it every now and then:

* Face the Hydra base unit.

* Look straight ahead and hold both hands up to about collar bone height and aim forward with the Hydra's, then press the reset button.

Tracking and weapon position is still very much a work in progress, you will probably have to experiment and find a position that works best for you.

Enjoy, and do let us know if you have any feature requests, bug reports, etc. :D

Update: You can download the crossbow model with working scope [here](https://mega.co.nz/#!tl52AaxR!WxejnjNJlQbjEmYUOoCrejQ3FT8xplnnwcC2zGaxcas).

**Deliberately non-A-list suggestions so far:**

* **USB hub ports on the headset** for Rift accessories (via 2nd USB cord at box connected to a *different* USB Bus). *-DocOculus*
* **Ventilation** (Two VERY low speed fans past eyes on either side and angled outward, drawing air upward from vents at bottom. Or just totally passive.) *-LuckyKo*
* **Unpluggable cable** (possibly mag-safe breakaway) between headset and box, replaceable with longer cable. *-DocOculus*
* **Pass-through audio and mic jacks** (+ clip to attach compatible headphones to strap/headset?) *-DocOculus*, *-WormSlayer*
* **Large hard-buttons** on the right and left sides of the headset, for use by apps. *-Dwilip* 
* **IPD knob on headset** (adjusts the IPD number sent to the PC)  *-BannedFromVR* 
* **Improved lens-distance adjustment hardware.** (knobs? adjust both eyes evenly at same time?) *-bootytown*
* **Fog-proof lenses.** *-Spankeey77*
* **Central configuration and storage of per-user Rift settings**, which are shared across programs and easily switchable between users. *-Spankeey77*
* **HDMI pass-through** *-WakeStrap*
* **Higher quality, non-absorbent foam** where the Rift contacts your face. *-Spankeey77*, *-ballthyrm*
* **Removable/washable foam** *-VoodooPuppy*, *-BannedFromVR*
* **More breathable head-straps.** *-ballthyrm*
* **Flat meshed cabling.** *-ballthyrm*
* **Customize-able FacePlate** via clips or other means, and obviously via bundled googly-eyes *-quadradial*, *-Gravitom*
* **Flip-up display** -EricsHepdesk* or **flip up bottom-panel** *-InfiniTree* for getting a peek the KB/hands/etc
* **Swappable head-bands** *-ballthyrm*
* **Ambient light edging** to help hide the Rift casing at the edge of your FOV. *-Maslo55*

**These might be A-list features, but it's hard to say, so I'll throw them down here:**

* **Eye/pupil tracking**  (via IR light &amp; small sensor array?) *-mpobers*
* **Slip Ring accessory** (for free-rotation in something like an Omni, I'm assuming) *-diminutive_lebowski*, *-Cunningcory*

Hello guys,
I've just discovered this reddit post and I'm flattered that our project is getting so many people talking :)
Please let me clarify a few controversial points:

- the current prototype cost ~300€, but we ordered the parts independently at full cost

- weight of the prototype is 380gr

- there is no focusing issue, have a look at my answer on MTBS3D http://www.mtbs3d.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=138&amp;t=18369&amp;p=140278&amp;hilit=InfinitEye#p140278

- there is no distortion issue either. If so, you would have the same problem with the Rift when you look at close range virtual objects (see 2nd picture of the previous link also) and I don't remember hearing people complaining about it. When you rotate your eyes, the distortion changes are not always the same even if Palmer told so (he must have forgotten the case where you don't look at infinitely distant objects ;)). We plan to make demo prototypes if this goes any further, then people will be able to judge it by themselves.

- the fresnel lenses we used are made out of PMMA and they produce a very sharp image. TheLostBrain, a very skilled DIYer of the MTBS3D community arrived to the same conclusion by testing the lenses himself:
http://www.mtbs3d.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=138&amp;t=16434&amp;start=80#p106164

We don't know yet where this is going. Plans for InfinitEye V1 have been available since February and only one guy recently used the open source design to make a prototype. Therefore we decided that a way to make the dual screen concept available to people could be through this contest. By entering it, we also wanted to know if people are really interested by what we have achieved.

Even if we participate and eventually win the Samsung contest, we won't be affiliated with them at all. Indeed, we'll get the support of an independent entrepreneur and a 100k€ envelop. It's always good to have a little money, keep in mind that we already spent a lot of our personal time and money on it and it's difficult now to move forward without people supporting us.
For the moment, our only goal is to improve the concept (we already have some ideas) and as we said, build up some demo prototypes to show people how immersive 210° FOV is. If you like our initiative, it's completely free for you to support us and share to your networks. International voters are welcome :)

So after playing around with Vireio Perception and Open Track I was able to get DayZ running with full headtracking. I have to say that's one intense experience playing on the Rift with some headphones on. It's a little bit rough navigating menus because the mouse clicks don't register in the right places, but you can get around with a keyboard.

Night time in DayZ on the Rift is both beautiful and terrifying, but it's one of the more relaxing scenes I've experienced in VR. During the day I had some trouble figuring out what was going on around me but after adjusting the FOV to 90 (no easy task) things were a lot more playable, and the games looks really nice in the Rift despite the low resolution. In fact it's one of the better looking experiences I've had. 

I noticed in the config file for the game there was options for setting the location of the UI. Perhaps with some playing we could get it more visible. The main item box is already in the middle of the screen and 100% viewable in the rift though, so that helps a lot.

I'm not sure if it's common knowledge that this is possible or not, so I can post a setup guide if others are interested in trying it out. I wasn't  able to find a guide for Day Z on the Rift anywhere so I just played around until I got it working.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,1372741381.0,,,True,t3_1hfwlz,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1hfwlz/dayz_on_the_rift_impressions/,

I really have to say something here about Dear Esther:  
This is the most immersive game I have played in the Rift so far. The horizon goes on forever, the sound is soul tearing, the sense of scale is mind numbing and the environment was relaxing. He always seems to start his monologue about the very thing you are looking at, and takes your imagination on a trip.  I recommend that every person that has a Rift now or will have one soon pick up this game an let yourself sink into the experience. This is as close to a ""made for VR"" game we are going to get for a while, soak it in. The only downsides were ""shadow crawl"" with rolling the head, and clearly 2d vegetation. I will be playing this game from start to finish, believe. I can't say enough good things about the Dear Esther experience.  
  
Until the Next VR Experiment,

It feels like yesterday since [our last mod post](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/170ugu/roculus_has_tripled_in_size_over_ces_welcome_to/) where we celebrated 2,000 users and a tripling in size over the course of CES. The great coverage from GDC at the end of March now brought another huge influx of new faces - **So here's a welcome to all new users!**

In a few days we'll reach 5,000 subscribers and enter the [Top 2,000](http://stattit.com/r/oculus/) list of all subreddits – which is pretty amazing given the young age of the subreddit. At this rapid growth, we feel it's necessary to get the community's feedback regarding the way we want to run this subreddit in the future. In the last [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/170ugu/roculus_has_tripled_in_size_over_ces_welcome_to/), you all gave some great feedback on the rules we proposed to keep the discussion culture healthy – Thanks for that! We already added some of the proposals and some other features:

1. We put up an [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/wiki/index) – if you have any feedback on that or want to become an approved editor for the FAQ, [drop us a note](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Foculus). 
2. We added links in the sidebar and got rid of some of the clutter.
3. A [twitter feed](http://twitter.com/redditoculus?) has been set up for those Tweeties among you.
4. We've added [AutoModerator](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoModerator/comments/q11pu/what_is_automoderator/) to the team, a great bot by /u/deimorz that helps with mod work. If you ever should run into problems with the bot, please leave us a message.
5. We started to give out  special flair to developers, journalists, video bloggers and the folks from Oculus themselves. If you see a small icon beside a user-name within the sub, you can hover over it to see who you're talking too. If you are a developer and would like to look a little more fancy, we'd be glad to hook you up - just [let us know](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Foculus).

---
Right now, the two concerns that pop up most often in the subreddit are memes and repetitive content. So the mod team would like to propose the following three rules for /r/oculus. Please keep in mind that these are only proposals from the team that are open for discussion, we want everyone's feedback (again) before putting them up in the sidebar:

1. **No memes:** Please refrain from submitting low-effort posts like memes or image macros. /r/oculus is a place for discussion and interesting articles surrounding VR and the Oculus Rift. If your post is just for entertainment and not for inciting discussion, this is probably not the right place for it.

2. **Search before submitting:** Please do a quick search before submitting anything to /r/oculus. Many questions have been asked already and our community usually is pretty quick when it comes to posting articles or videos. But if you have a question that hasn't been asked or want to start a new discussion about an older submission, feel free to put it in front of the community.

3. **Do not post only a link with the description ""Imagine this in the Rift"" or ""Game XY + Oculus Rift = AWESOME"":** These low effort posts are against galactic law and will be removed. If you know a game, a device or a program that would be awesome with the Rift, make a self-post, elaborate why it would be a good fit for the Rift and maybe post a video or a screenshot to illustrate your post. The aim should be to start a discussion, so getting your opinion is essential.

After playing around with some key bindings I've come up with a solution that seems to be working quite well! Only do this if you wish to have 'walking' speed as default.

What this does is it sets your basic movement speed to be similar to a walking speed, you can hold down shift to run or hold down alt to sprint (suit sprint). 

First browse to ""\Steam\SteamApps\common\Half-Life 2\hl2\cfg"" and create a new text document named 'autoexec.cfg', open the cfg file and add the following lines

    cl_forwardspeed 100;
    cl_sidespeed 70;
    cl_backspeed 60;
    cl_upspeed 40;
    
    alias ""+fast"" ""cl_forwardspeed 200;""
    alias ""-fast"" ""cl_forwardspeed 100;""
    bind ""shift"" +fast
    
    alias ""+duckfast"" ""+duck; cl_forwardspeed 200;""
    alias ""-duckfast"" ""-duck; cl_forwardspeed 100;""
    bind ""ctrl"" ""+duckfast;""
    
    alias ""+sprintfast"" ""+speed; cl_forwardspeed 450;""
    alias ""-sprintfast"" ""-speed; cl_forwardspeed 100;""
    bind ""alt"" ""+sprintfast;""    

Feel free to edit the bind keys to whatever feels more comfortable to you. With more natural movement speed the game seems to feel a lot more comfortable in VR. Most of the time fast movement is very good for normal gaming since you always want to be in the action, however, VR seems to really relax this feeling, and walking around slower and just looking at your surroundings is just as entertaining as the action parts.  

I really hope someone finds this useful!",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1igbic,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1igbic/halflife_2_natural_movement_speed_tutorial/,

I'm the lead dev for The Dead Linger, and our Oculus Rift just arrived. ([unboxing](http://www.thedeadlinger.com/archives/1755)) I've been playing around with the dev kit, and we have plans to implement it into our game soon. Here is a list of my comments and remarks about it, as well as how it's implemented into various Rift demos and TF2 specifically. I figure some people would like a first-hand account, and feel free to ask questions.

Complaints/concerns first;

- **Motion sickness.** This is my biggest problem with it right now. Everything else comes second to the fact that I feel nauseated after using it. It's getting better each time I play around with it, but it's something that I could see being a very annoying ""bar of entry"" for gamers trying to use it. I don't know what to do about this, but certain implementations (a few of the ""vr_moveaim_mode"" settings in TF2) definitely make it worse. I would say the biggest problem is the refresh rate on the display. When you turn your head, it blurs the screen, even on small movements. If the screen refreshed quicker, I assume this wouldn't be as big of a problem. /u/DJCochoKay had [a nice post](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1cnm8k/combating_motion_sickness/c9iaa38) on possible ways to combat this.

- **It's not something you can trade to friends quickly.** Everyone's eyes are different - you really have to tweak it to get it set up for your eyes, and then not touch it at all. Anything slightly out of focus or not feeling right can definitely increase motion sickness and general discomfort. You can't just sit down and play a segment of a game really quick unless your eyes are VERY similar.

- TF2's default move-aim mode is pretty good, but I really hope developers start letting you look up and down with the mouse, and give the crossair (if it's free-floating like TF2 has it) a much smaller ""box"". If the mouse movement was tighter, making it easier to turn, I would feel better and probably get less motion sick from all the swaying and such.

- Crossairs and HUD are often ""close"" so **when you're focusing on a far target the crossair general goes double-vision for you, making it harder to aim in FPS games.** This would also be a problem in 3rd person games, I imagine. I hope developers consider including a mode to use the Oculus Rift without stereoscopic 3D, and simply use the headset for free-look tracking. That, or make the crossair much further away, somehow. I haven't looked in detail on how to do this, but these are things I'm going to keep my eye out for when we begin to implement this into our game.

- You can see the pixels on the display. I can even make out the RGB bits of each pixel. It's quite profound. Sometimes you get snapped out of the moment by remembering you're looking at a screen, and it obviously looks like a screen. Hopefully the consumer version will pull through with a smoother, higher resolution display, and then you will REALLY be in the world.

- **The Oculus Rift seriously needs simple plastic knobs on the lens focus adjusters.** I tweeted Oculus about this and they said ""Use a coin."" Well sure, but it's hard to line up the coin while you're wearing it as well. Why not just put an easy to find knob? If you can't find the knob with your eyes closed, it's just bad design for the consumer. It wouldn't make the unit bulkier any bulkier, and it would barely take any more material.

- **But it's not all bad!** The Oculus Rift ramps up the immersion factor a ton. You really feel transported to the world you're in, especially without being able to see the room you're sitting in. **When you've got that headset on, pop on some headphones, and you are THERE.** It's incredible.

Despite all the complaints or concerns, this thing does exactly what it's meant to do, and comes with all the right parts. I would also recommend Oculus ship it with a ""video splitter"" cable, as I've had to order one off the internet. But mark my words, The Oculus Rift is definitely a big deal. I can't wait to use it and develop with it more.

That's all I have to say about that. Thanks for reading!",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,sandsweptflair,True,t3_1cq5hl,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1cq5hl/the_dead_linger_dev_here_here_is_my_experience/,

I recently pledged for a different product through kickstarter and it took a LONG time to go through customs. The problem was that the invoice was not attached to the outside of the package, thus making it impossible for the customs agent to determine the real value of the contents. The sender had filled out the customs form, but since those get changed regularly to baffle customs, the European Union (and other countries as well) needs the invoice to check the real value. But since customs may not open a package if it isn't deemed dangerous, bureaucracy took over.

If the invoice is attached to the outside, the package will be cleared through customs quickly and the recipient gets it delivered to his home and pays the customs toll there. But if it is not attached, the package is sent first to the main customs agency, then on to the local customs bureau. There, someone writes a letter to your home telling you that you have a package. Then you have to retrieve it from your local agency, which can take some time as well. 

**tl;dr: Please attach a copy of the invoice to the outside of the package when sending to Non-US countries. Otherwise, it takes up to two weeks longer until we get our Dev Kit because of how customs work.**

Thanks!

For those of you out there still waiting for your dev kit and have burning questions, or would like me to try something specific, please let me know. I am also open to collaboration/testing - I have already started this with a few devs with very positive results.  
  
I realize that by committing to this, pretty much all my spare time outside of work will be dedicated to VR. I am okay with this. XD  If there is a way I can help the community be more prepared to make awesome VR experiences, I want to do it!

* Absolute rotation and position sensors.
* Highly accurate and precise finger flex-sensors: 2 per finger to measure both the bend of the knuckle as well as the flex of the rest of the finger.
* Electro-Tactile Feedback Grid on the fingertips to simulate surface smoothness and detail. this is hard to do right so IF I don't like the prototype I probably won't include it in a finished product.
* Durability. it **HAS** to be able to take a beating as gamers are ruthless when it comes to their gear.
* Backwards-Compatibility with future iterations: if I choose to pursue force(resistive) feedback for the fingers, I want to be able to apply the new technology to already existing gloves that have already been sold.
* Easily Hook-able API: it has to be easy to set up in your favorite VR games.
* Low Latency: as low as possible to make hand-eye coordination easy
* Cool-Looking: self-explanatory.
* wireless: a possibility
* Ambidextrous: models for both hands will be available. it is assumed players will want to use both hands.
* serviceable: cloth portions(if they exist) will be removable/washable and all parts which contact skin will be sweat/moisture proof.
* replaceable parts: i like the idea of hackers being able to service their gloves though for the less electrically skilled, fingers would be replaceable if they break/wear out.

Once I have a working prototype, I will launching on kickstarter.

Vrui is the software infrastructure I used to make all the movies on my YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/okreylos), and specifically the most recent Rift videos http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IERHs7yYsWI , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MN3FHrQUa4 , and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyoJKbzqpZA .

I figured I'd announce it here because I thought a few of you might want to have a look at it; at least some of you asked for it. There are three related posts on my blog: http://doc-ok.org/?p=624 explains what took me so long, http://doc-ok.org/?p=631 is more detail about Vrui itself, and finally http://doc-ok.org/?p=639 is a (very!) detailed how-to guide on installing Vrui and configuring it for an Oculus Rift and optionally a Razer Hydra. Vrui supports many more input devices, and many more uses of the Hydra (head tracking comes to mind), but those ""advanced features"" are left for future how-to guides, or for yourselves to figure out. :)

In a nutshell: if you have a decent graphics card (ideally something Nvidia), a Rift, and either have Linux, or are willing to install it alongside whatever else you have, you're good to go.

Vrui itself is very old and solid software, but I consider the Rift binding beta at this point, and I'm specifically talking about using mouse and keyboard with the Rift. The paradigm shift caused by people actually wanting to use an HMD with a mouse was what forced me to crank the version number all the way from 2.8 to 3.0. So I'm looking for a bit of feedback, especially on any problems you encounter. We can do this on this subreddit, or on my blog, whatever works.

This is as close as I can get it to perfect.

[Image Gallery - Inventory, Bars/Compass etc](http://imgur.com/a/JH9dq)

**What I've managed to get ""working"":**

* Visual improvement mods (excluding ENB)
* Improved HUD readability - Health, Mana &amp; Compass are visible and easy to see (I'm ignoring Stamina)
* Improved Inventory readability - Basically relying on SkyUI's Item cards and 3D Items

**What to get:**

1. First off, get Skyrim installed and up to date. I'm going to assume you know how to do your initial config. (i.e. [Download SKSE](http://skse.silverlock.org/), launch Skyrim once, set resolution to 1280x800, drop the AA)
2. Download and install the following mods (The Flora Overhaul requires editing a line in your skyrimprefs.ini):

* [Skyrim HD 2K Textures v1.5 FULL - Dungeons | Landscape | Towns | Misc](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/607)
* [Static Mesh Improvement Mod](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8655)
* [Skyrim Flora Overhaul](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/141)
* [Lush Trees and Grass](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3288)
* [AOF Detailed Mountains](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4805)
* [High realistic tundra moss for AOF](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28292)
* [W.A.T.E.R](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13268)
* [SkyUI](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3863)
* [Minimal HUD](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33482)

**What to edit:**

3. In your **skyrim.ini** under [Display] add: **fDefaultFOV=110 | fDefaultWorldFOV=110**
4. As a backup I also add the above lines to skyrimprefs.ini under [Display]
5. While in **skyrimprefs.ini** do the following: **fShadowDistance=0.0000 | bTreesReceiveShadows=1 | fShadowLODStartFade=0.0000| bDrawLandShadows=1 | iPresentInterval=0 | bDeferredShadows=0**
6. From your Perception bin folder copy the three DLLs into your base Skyrim directory (I found this necessary when running Skyrim from skse_loader... not sure why the Perception config isn't detecting it.)
7. Launch Perception and select OcculusRift + OculusTrack (I have to do this, even with vireio d3d9.dll in the game dir) and launch the game via **skse_loader.exe**
8. Once you've got your IPD, parallax settings sorted, hit escape and go to *Mod Configuration*.
9. Go to *MinimalHUD | Layout Manager*. At the bottom, select the Factory Preset: **16:10 Scaled Vanilla** as your starting point.
10. Now go to *Healthbar* and set the following: **x= -270, y= 70, height = 100%**
11. Now to *Manabar* and set the following: **x= 15, y= 70, height = 100%**
12. Finally go to *Compass* and set the following: **x= -456, y= -350**
13. Go back a couple of menus and into *SkyUI*.
14. In *General*, change the Font Size to Large. (it could help for some)
15. In *Advanced | Item Card*, set the following: **Center, Horizontal= -150**
16. Under *3D Item*, set the following: **Horizontal= 10**

With all that, you should find that in your first person view you'll be able to see your health near your left arm, your mana near your right, and the compass directly above.

If you go in to your inventory you should notice that the item card is a little overlapped with the main inventory window, but it should be more within your readable field of view.

Sadly I did all this and actually have no intention of properly playing Skyrim again. I just wanted to see if it could be done :D

**Edit 2:** Clarified Steps 6-7.

We've just uploaded a new demo for Oculus Rift called [Blue Marble](http://jaywalkersinteractive.com).

* **What is it?**

Blue Marble is a free demo for use with the Oculus Rift.
 
* **What does it do?**

Blue Marble takes you on a journey into space while listening to your favourite music. We've put a few royalty free tracks in the demo, but you can also listen to your own music. Just put your favourite songs in the ""YourMusicHere""-folder in the Blue Marble directory and select one of them in the in-game menu. Hit launch, sit back, relax and enjoy.

Note: Songs must be in the .ogg file format. Unfortunately, due to licensing issues, we cannot support mp3. We've included Audacity in the download, with which you can easily convert your mp3's to the .ogg format. To convert your song, open the mp3 in Audacity &gt; Export &gt; Select .ogg extension &gt; Save.
 
* **Why is it?**

We love being game developers, but if we were a lot smarter, we would be astronauts! ;)

Apart from that, we've noticed that some people who do not yet have their ""VR-legs"" can feel uneasy when they try the Rift, because a lot of demos feature quite a bit of motion. Blue Marble is designed to be a very relaxing experience which can be enjoyed by anyone, even those unfamiliar to virtual reality or prone to motion sickness.
 
* **Read me**

Use the *highest possible resolution*^1 at a *16:9 aspect ratio*^2 and *connect your Rift through DVI*^3

^1 Even though the Rift's resolution is only 1280x800, image quality is greatly improved when selecting a much higher resolution on startup. It seems that the Rift accepts high input resolutions, resulting in a much smoother looking image when compared to running the build in the Rift's native 1280x800 resolution.

^2 It seems you should run the demo in a 16:9 aspect ratio -or- at an aspect ratio matching your primary monitor. When the aspect ratio isn't 16:9, the view inside the Rift will be distorted. This is weird, since the aspect ratio of the Rift's screen is 16:10. We think this is a bug with the Unity Rift integration. Since we only have 16:9 monitors, we cannot test this thoroughly. It might be that you should choose an aspect ratio fitting to your primary monitor when you mirror your Rift.

^3 When connecting the Rift through HDMI, black levels are greatly affected when running any other resolution than the native 1280x800. When we connect the Rift through DVI, we don't have this problem.

Note: We don't know if our observations are consistent across different setups. If you experience different results or any other weird stuff, please let us know so we can get to the bottom of all this!
 
* **Any recommended songs?**

You should try Space Oddity by Col. Chris Hadfield - the boss of space. We also really enjoy the demo with Mad World by Gary Jules and Protectors of the Earth by Two Steps From Hell. They are awesome. (Don't forget to convert them to the .ogg format.)

Do you know any other cool songs to go along with it? Do share!

................................

Thanks for checking it out, we hope you enjoy it and we would love to know what you think. Cheers!

Vincent and Laurens, Jaywalkers Interactive

I wanted to keep tinkering for a bit more, but with all those Demos etc. popping up I thought that people with a rift actually need this NAO.

If you want to get an email for any bigger updates you can send your adr. to me at the bottom of the page. Same with any comments, missing games etc.

The ultimate goal is to have a list with ALL Games, Demos etc. that run with the rift, when they will release, what level of support they have, any information regarding the config, what 3rd party drives are needed, what genres, kickstarter links etc. for your searching and sorting pleasure.

Edit: Ok, just rolling out a big update. It still looks like ass, but I added a whole bunch of games, tinkered around some more on the DB, added all the driver/native compatibility info and at least made the thing filterable with support type.

Oculus Rift 

- Added preliminary support for the Oculus Rift VR Headset Development Kit. 

Follow the instructions of the dev kit to install it as either an extended desktop monitor 
(recommended) or as a duplicated monitor (may allow you to see on a monitor what is visible 
inside the Rift). The resolution for the dev kit monitor should be 1280x800. 


When launching the simulator, it will attempt to detect the Rift. If it is detected, a dialog 
box will prompt you if you want to use the Rift. If the simulator does not properly detect the 
Rift, try configuring it differently on the PC. 


Centering the Rift: When the simulator first launches, the 2D loading screen image will 
appear (as usual), about a meter way from the view point. While on the loading screen, hold 
your head straight and level, and press any key to re-center the head tracking. Any time 
after loading completes, such as on the replay screen or while driving, you may use the 
assignable hot key (options screen, default is ‘;’) to re-center the head mounted display 
(HMD). You may want to assign this command to a button on your wheel, to make it as easy as 
possible to re-center if necessary. 


VSYNC is optional when the Rift is enabled, specified via the graphics options screen. VSYNC 
is recommended to prevent tearing, but many report less latency and better tracking with it 
disabled. 


Multisampling is supported with the Rift. The number of samples per pixel is specified in the 
graphics options screen (AA #samples) and is applied to the Rift’s display if supported on 
your GPU. 


The user interface screens now pan (to a limited extent) with head tracking. This allows 
navigation of the garage and options screen within the Rift. It also allows the black boxes 
and other driving UI to be viewed while driving. This is a work in progress. 


In general, achieving higher frame rates is very important when using the Rift. Reduce 
graphics quality as necessary to achieve low latency head tracking. 


There are several new options located renderer.ini related to the Rift as follows. 


[Oculus Rift] 
CorrectYaw=1 ; Enable magnetic yaw correction 
CorrectPitch=1 ; Enable gravity based pitch correction 
UsePrediction=1 ; Enable motion prediction 
PredictionTimeMS=20 ; How many milliseconds to use during prediction 
ForceVSYNC=0 ; Force on VSYNC for Rift even if disabled in the graphics 
options settings 
PanUserInterfaceToEdge=0 ; Allows user interface to pan further with head tracking 


ForceVSYNC causes VSYNC to be enabled whenever the Rift is in use. When set, it overides the 
setting from the options screen only for the Rift. We don’t currently set this option by 
default because it increases controller lag and head tracking latency on some PC's. 


The CorrectYaw and CorrectPitch settings, when enabled, use the Rift’s magnetometers (for 
yaw/magnetic fields) and accelerometers (for pitch/gravity) to help correct any drift 
accumulated during driving. When Yaw correction is enabled, whenever you recenter the Rift 
(using the hotkey) a magnetic calibration will automatically begin – the calibration will 
automatically complete after the headset is rotated over a large enough range (it helps to 
look around after initiating the calibration).",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1ilrqb,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1ilrqb/iracing_gets_official_oculus_rift_support/,

Please chime in: What can we do to make our community even better?,60,3,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/170ugu/roculus_has_tripled_in_size_over_ces_welcome_to/,"Hi fellow Riftoholics!

Over the course of CES, /r/oculus has almost tripled in size – so first of all: **Welcome to all our new subscribers!** 

Before CES we had about 600 subscribers, but the gleaming coverage on the Oculus Rift let this subreddit really explode in numbers (*see comments for detailed traffic stats*). According to [stattit.com](http://stattit.com/r/oculus/), /r/oculus was the second-fastest growing subreddit over the last seven days and we are in the Top 1,000 when it comes to activity! For a subreddit that has been founded only 5 months ago, this is an impressive feat. So, let's pat each other on our virtual shoulders and talk a little about how to make this place even better!

---

**FAQ** - As discussed in the [latest thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/16zh8d/now_that_this_subreddit_is_famous_shouldnt_there/), there may be a need for a centralised FAQ which covers the essential questions. We are already working on a FAQ as we speak, so if you have anything that should be covered in it, let us know in here!

**Repetitive Content** - With the influx of new users, recurring debates (Leap Motion, OMG SKYRIM ON THE RIFT) have popped up again. This is really only a problem for long-time users of this subreddit, because we have seen these topics discussed a few times now. But we can all understand the initial enthusiasm that the newcomers have for the Rift – We have all been there, believe us :)

I wouldn't like to quench that enthusiasm, but repetitive content is a problem inherent to reddit's design (""REPOST"", anyone?) and could lead to a loss of interest over the long term. So: Shall we actively moderate these kinds of topics? Or just allow them, because each of these discussions usually has a different vibe to it? What are your thoughts on this?

**Sidebar &amp; Header** - We'll put a link to the FAQ in the sidebar, but are there any other interesting sites that we should link to? Any cool sidebar designs you saw on other subreddits that we shall adapt? Let us know. Plus: Any photoshop gods out there that want to make us a new header? Or shall we keep our little cyclop? :)

**Moderation** - For the time being, we have a laissez-faire mentality when it comes to moderation. Of course we check reported content (please use the Report button and leave us a [message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Foculus) if you see spam posts), but so far, all the negative or falsely informed comments got downvoted pretty fast. With more users, we're going to see a larger need for moderation – so if you ever see a necessity for a change in moderation style down the road, let us know.

**Memes** - I guess that this is one of the most controversial topics: Shall we allow memes in /r/Oculus? I am not talking about the occasional Rift photoshop, but about low-effort meme images that don't really contribute to the discussion. Memes aren't really a problem at the moment, but could become one once more people hop onto the Rift train. 

Don't get me wrong: I think that we could use a little more fun in here now and then. I also think that our little group is perfectly able to downvote any such posts that are worth the downvote. But reddit has a tendency to push up content that is lowest-common-denominator (easily digestable, short and funny). So sooner or later, we'll get to the point where memes will be upvoted and lengthy discussions will not, because they are harder to digest. I think it's better to take a stance on this before the real flood of visitors come around – so what's your opinion on this?

**Thanks for reading and let us know if you have any other ideas on how to improve the subreddit!**

So it just came in the mail, what now? Well, first things first, plug it into your secondary DVI or HDMI port, depending on your setup. The easiest way to rift is to clone your main display at 1280 x 800 so both your main monitor and rift show the same thing at that resolution. It's not the best setup, but it will do until you get on your feet.

You'll notice 3 lenses, A, B and C. Stick with A to start with, but try the others and see which one suits you best. I tried them all, preferring B but eventually came back to the A lens.

So... impatient? Demos downloading? Check out these videos in the meantime! Put these in fullscreen and they'll work in your rift with the cloned display setting:

**Motion Sickness**

You'll probably get sick pretty quick. I did. I nearly threw up after a 45 minute Half Life 2 session on the 2nd day. The good news is that for me, it's wearing off! I find I can stay on for longer than before and I don't seem to get the stomach lurches as much. Don't push yourself like I did at the start though, I got physically ill and it took a while to wear off.

1371405930.0,57,self.oculus,1ggqxs,To Non Developers Tempted To Get Started...,66,9,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1ggqxs/to_non_developers_tempted_to_get_started/,"I had an interesting conversation yesterday and feel that it might be relevant to more people.

For those of you that have never used a game engine or IDE first thing I want to say is it is not a wall of text.

When I first started that is all i imagined, a big wall of words that magically turned into a game. 

The truth of the matter is most game engines more closely resemble level creators from common games, like the farcry level editor and tony hawks ones etc.


**Initial UI**
****

The idea is that you see a view of the world [similar to 3d modelling apps.](http://www.worldofleveldesign.com/categories/level_design_tutorials/images/011-level-design-editors-01.jpg) One View in 3d, and three others representing the top and side views. then you drag items like cars and trees into the view and place them.

**Building Terrain**
****
For building terrain, it is like [painting in photoshop...but in 3d](http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/rsrc/Three/LandscapeEditing/LandscapeEditDialog.jpg) you push and pull the earth and smooth out areas, then switch to texture mode and paint onto the terrain rock texture or grass etc.... 


**Animation**
****
If you are not talking about character animation but sliding doors and elevators, these are normally done in a timeline manner similar to audio editing apps or video editing apps like After Effects.

You start a timeline, place an object like an elevator floor. then you set the timeline to the number of seconds and move it up to where you want. Then save that ""animation"" and you can play it whenever certain things happen, buttons are pressed or certain invisible triggers are hit.

**The more complex Stuff**
****

Here is where we get into programming. But even that can be mostly avoided. I am unsure about unity in this as I have only used it a little (my main area is Unreal Engine) but you have a visual programming tool.

Essentially think of a tree, you place a node down representing your character. (a circle) then you place an action like ""touched"" and then you place your animation from earlier.

[The entire programming logic](http://chrisholden.net/tutor/OT_docs_kismet-door17.jpg) is to draw lines from each, so it says ""if player touches trigger then play animation"" which in this case would open an elevator.

**Where to start**
****

My advice to non-developers on how to get started. 
It really depends how deep down the rabbit whole you want to go. 
If you want to just build a planet surface, add some buggies and trees and things,...start with unity. it is great for that kind of thing. 

If you want to go a bit deeper and do complex animations and things without having to learn a programming language....go to UDK

If you INTEND on learning a programming language down the line then of all the ones supported by the engines Javascript is the easiest to get started with....so go back to unity.

Finally if you KNOW a programming language like java or something then I would say use UDK because picking up new languages when you know one is easy. I learned C# in  a month and a half with just a java background and now it is my favourite language. Similar Story with UnrealScript which is the primary language for use with UDK.

*edit: changed up the above paragraph so it was less misleading regarding UDK and C#. yes it is doable but it is not designed for it and it is a bit of a messy operation. 

Also with the Visual Studio integration you can quickly extend existing code items in the Unreal Tournament Example and make your own versions of the already extensive first person shooter example in place. 

****
***GOOD LUCK!***





***EDIT***

I did a bit more research into unity. It occurred to me my lack of knowledge in unity may have seemed like an unfair bias to UDK. Which, In fairness could be true given that I am a tried and true coder and PREFER the walls of text, But I do appreciate that they are a stumbling block for beginners and those more artists than coders and see unity as being a different environment. 

In summary I prefer udk because I feel that while it has a UI that lends itself to getting started through a graphical medium It's focus is code and has some very powerful back-end features and can lead to a much less limiting environment as a developer....if you intend to go that way.
Unity is built in my mind as an engine for quickly developing simple games and building powerful complex multi-platform games. But it is also a less powerful engine and lacks some of the features of UDK. 

I spend a lot of time doing complex code and end up having my work judged on the polish of the gameEngine and models. With UDK, despite having very little artistic ability, The intrinsic quality of the engine and the powerhouse of processing in things like the light and particle engines mean I can focus on what I am good at and have the engine do the polish for me.
( Also many people in my position are more daunted by a code-free/UI environment than a wall of text!) 

But all that aside I did some research and amend my opinion. Apparent there is a tool called [PlayMaker](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/182860/suck_at_coding_but_make_games_.php?print=1)
Which approximates UDK's kismet. So yes. for everyone starting out. Go Unity. 

It is a cool engine with a much larger help community and the store is a fantastic place to quickly acquire aspects you are missing from your game without having to know everything about every aspect (e.g physics) you can outsource that and just pick up some libraries or parts. Also the way they use a decorator style pattern for objects is quite cool.

you build a movable object, attach a light to it...you now have a movable light. attach a turret to it you now have a glowing movable turret. add an AI object and you have a ....you get the picture.

**Finally**

I love this discussion. it will only help in furthering the community knowledge and making better quality demos for all of us so keep it up!

So I'm not going to parrot what's already been said about how immerse it is, the screen door effect, yadda yadda yadda...

So there's just a few bullet points I want to mention that I don't think anyone else has said before.

* Eye movement

You can meaningfully move your eyes around to look around before moving your head. I tend not to keep my gaze fixed dead-ahead while rotating my head to look around as if I were using binoculars.

* Sense of presence

This really varies depending on the title, and whether or not you have positional tracking (more on this later) - sometimes you can suspend belief just long enough to feel like you're really there. Sometimes though it feels like you're controlling a remote drone whose cameras you are looking through. It's a different sensation rather than being a worse one.

* Installation

The rift is true plug'n'play from a drivers perspective. Windows 7 knows what to do with it out of the box. Getting rift-native games to work with it is straightforward and painless. I've not done much in the way of using non-native applications with Vireio Perception though so no comments there yet.

* Positional tracking with the Hydra

I've been playing with the Tuscany demo with a hydra for positional tracking. Instantly the experience got ten times better. The sense of really being there was greatly increased and I was noticing the imperfections (screen door, etc) much less. I didn't have much room to play with but I was quite happy walking around a small area and being able to crouch or kneel to look at something, or leaning forward to look through a window.

I also found that I didn't get any VR sickness with positional tracking. It was entirely comfortable the whole time. Now I may just be getting my VR legs at this point having had it a week, but this was something else.

tl;dr: Positional tracking alone single-handedly makes up for all of the Rifts other deficiencies in my experience.

Happy to take questions if you have any.

1375276546.0,57,self.oculus,1jf364,My first impressions after using the rift for two days,67,10,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1jf364/my_first_impressions_after_using_the_rift_for_two/,"Warning: long text from a non-native English speaker with grammar and spelling mistakes ahead :-).

Hi there,

after two days using the rift, I just want to share my thoughts about it. I am trying to write down some points I didn't read much about yet. There are some flaws which I want to mention, but don't think that I am disappointed. It is already a great device and as soon as some of the flaws I wrote down will be resolved, I definitely will buy the final version. 

**Hardware**

* **Screen**:
You can read so much about the resolution and the screen door effect, so I decided not to talk much about it in general. Yes, it is noticeable, but depending on the content you are looking at. But I want to share my thoughts from a developer point of view: I don't know if I could make and TEST a good user interface with the current low resolution. You have to make the fonts really large if you want the text to be readable. But menus don't always consist of only one or two lines of text. Start HL2 and open the Options-Menu. Inside this menu, the user can change the most important parameters like resolution, audio or key bindings. But the menu is unreadable inside the rift. The only way to solve this is to scale up the complete menu with the result that only a part of the menu would be visible at a time and head movement is needed to ""navigate"" inside the menu. I don't think that this is very comfortable because you can get ""lost"" easily if you move your head too fast and you need a second or two to realize which part of the menu you are currently looking on. The effect of the moving menu is great for the first time. But if you are really looking for a specific element, you need much more time. Titans of Space has a good menu for the current DevKit, but as a consumer it is not really easy to get used to it because you are not able to get a good overview on the structure of the menu. Currently it works fine, but as soon as the user will be able to change the key bindings or the graphic quality, it will get confusing very fast. I know that this problem would be solved with the HD-version because you do not need to scale up everything so much, but it would be great to be able test a menu with the HD screen before launching a title. If you realize the long waiting time for the current DevKit, it would not be very easy to find the time for a second DevKit. But maybe Oculus can give everybody, how has pre-ordered up to now, the opportunity to pre-order the consumer version. So every developer who needs the HD-version to finish their game, might get the possibility to receiving the final version one month ahead of the real release - to re-test and adjust a few things. Oculus would not have to create a new production line for another prototype, but completed software will be available at launch day one. 
* **Cables**
After unboxing the rift and plugging in everything needed, my desk was full of cables: headphone-cables trying to get married with the rift cable, HDMI and USB cable already combined themselves to one big cable spaghetti. It was really annoying. I would love to see a wireless version. I know that is is not very easy because of latency and the amount of pixels to be transported at 60Hz. But the possibility to rotate freely on the chair would boost the immersion factor massively. If a wireless version is not possible at the moment, please use a thinner and longer cable for the rift. The USB and the HDMI cable ~~must not~~ doesn't have to be that long, but the length and the weight of the rift cable is really important.
* **Control Box**
I did not use the contrast or brightness buttons yet but I think these buttons should be placed at the side of the rift itself. If I would have to change the contrast for example, I would always have to remove the rift, find the right buttons, go inside the rift again and press them. This is not comfortable at all. This fits on the next scenario, too:
* **IPD Setup, Profiles, etc**
I think the setup should not be an executable on the system - instead it should be inside the rift, too. So you can simply plug it in and open the profile menu inside the rift - without any other program needed. Setup everything you need and save it only with the rift. The SDK returns the needed values directly from the rift to the game engine. I know - not very easy and the hardware has to be extended a lot, but it might be a good idea.
* **Setting up the rift**
A month or two ago, somebody wrote that the consumer version might have a different lens system: instead of changing between different lenses, you can adjust the build-in ones. I don't know if this is really possible (and if I understood this correctly), but I would love to see that. Changing the lenses is ok for a DevKit, but from a consumer point of view, it is really not very comfortable. Dust coming inside the rift, the danger for scratching the lenses - the rift might get a lot of negative reputation if every idiot who broke something, create posts with ""wtf, it was broken on day one, what a piece of sh*t!"" everywhere. 
* **Big-nose-problem**
I have a big nose and the rift always touches a small part of it. After a few minutes it really gets uncomfortable. Please add a thin foam on the nose part, too - or at least the possibility. 
* **Hardware-wish**
Two cameras in front of the rift, always being able to turn them on or off with a single button on the side of the rift. For the first consumer version, this should be enough. For the second version, it should be possible to read-out the images with the SDK.

**Software**

* **Particles everywhere**
What I love inside Tuscany is the number of particles in the air and small moving objects like birds. This really improved my immersion. You realize that you do not walk through a complete empty space with a few walls and objects in it - you walk trough air. The 3D effect is present all the time and I love it. If you create a game, please add small floating particles. Not too much, but at least a bit. This can be snow, rain, small objects in space, dust, foliage, butterflies, small stones from racing cars in front of you or anything like that. Or just an annoying fly which tries to land on your virtual nose ;-)
* **Motion sickness**
I tried to figure out what is good for me and what is bad. I got my rift two days ago but as far as I can tell up to now. The correct IPD is not so important for me. But other things are like disabled Depth of Field, always enabled head tracking and soft movement. Speeding up immediately feels a bit strange. Strafing is not such a big problem but I realized something different. In VR Cinema, everything was ok until I turned my head right and pressed forward. This feeling was bad.
* **FPS controls**
I like the default control scheme in Half Life 2. But there is a problem: as soon as you reach the border of the dead zone, you instantly start to rotate with the current speed of the mouse. This can make you really dizzy unless you really slow down your mouse movement. Maybe it is better to start rotating slowly as soon as the mouse reaches the border of the dead zone in the middle. I am not able to test it at the moment because my engine is not rift-ready yet. But as soon as this works, I will try to test it.
* **Software-wish**
A single DLL with a small C-interface in addition to the C++ SKD. It would be much easier to use the rift with other programming languages. The interface ~~must not~~ doesn't have to give the flexibility of the SDK, but the basics should be possible: init rift, read HMD-parameters, read rotation (and position :-) ), read and write profiles. I know that you can build your own interface, but an official and easy way would be very cool.

A short checklist for beginners to prevent motion sickness (only tested by myself, so no guarantee):

* Eat something first, do not use the rift with an empty stomach. Eat something, wait for about half an hour and then start
* Drink a ginger tea. It really helped me a lot. Yesterday I could not wait after coming home and started immediately. After 10 minutes I really got sick. So I eat something, drank a ginger tea and after two hours I could start again without any major problems.
* Only use slow demos at the beginning and avoid vireio. I used the Tuscany demo to setup everything (lenses, etc.) and just enjoyed it without walking very much. After that, I tried VR Cinema which was really good, too. Then I made the mistake of trying vireio with Mirror's Edge - I had to stop the session and wait for about an hour. I would recommence to play Proton Pulse for at least half an hour to get comfortable with the rift AND the head movement. After that, you can continue with guided movement demos like Blue Marble or Titans of Space. After that you can continue with more ""advanced"" demos. I know that you can not wait to test everything with the rift but take your time - the demos will not run away and you will enjoy them much more if you don't have to quit after a few minutes. 
* On day one I tried Half Life 2 for two minutes and it was horrible. Yesterday evening (day two), after half an hour of Proton Pulse, I retried HL2 and I could play for almost one hour without any major problem. On day one, I really had problems with the control scheme in HL2 - but on day two, I already learned how to use it. I think I will need a few more days before I can start fighting. What really helps me, too: if you feel a bit uncomfortable, close your eyes and take a deep breath. At least it works for me.
* Do not move on your chair. This feels really strange without positional tracking. 

**tl;dr**

The idea of the rift is wonderful and the current DevKit is absolutely amazing. There is still a long way to go, but I do not see a conceptional or unsolvable problem at all. As soon as the small flaws are solved or reduced to the minimum, it will be THE VR device. A lot of people already made great demos and more are on their way, so the software part is already moving forward, too. I love my current DevKit and I am sure I will love the first consumer version even more. 


Oculus: great job, thanks a lot!

The project looks like a great game made for the Rift: exploration in quite stunning environments. The game is already funded ($15,000) and they are very close to their stretched goal of supporting the Rift ($25,000). At this time they have only $2000 to go but the Kickstarter will end today, so very little time is left and not reaching this stretched goal is a very real possibility.

The game would be a great showcase for the Oculus besides being potentially a great experience. If you have some financial reserves, do back this project ^please . The estimated delivery date is October 2013, so that is pretty close by. The beta should even be available as soon as April (although I am not sure they'll already have Rift support that early on).

1376675005.0,51,self.oculus,1ki0qx,Me vs. Intense Motion Sickness: 1 week later,60,9,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1ki0qx/me_vs_intense_motion_sickness_1_week_later/,"I thought I'd post this as I initially thought my brain wasn't compatible with the rift (or the amount of time it would take me to get used to the rift just simply wouldn't be worth it) - I figured for the large handful of people battling with motion sickness, this may be reassuring. If, like me, you were disappointed when you first experienced the rift due to a lack of immersion and overwhelming sense of motion sickness.......

Firstly - everyone has a personal (or no) relationship with motion sickness. I suffer from vertigo, sea-sickness and car sickness i.e. I may seem like a no-hoper from the start. However I experience little to no motion sickness 99% of the time I play video games on a large projected screen (I was hoping this would relate to the rift).

Using the rift was a very similar feeling to wearing glasses for the first time - short bursts were necessary as my eyes weren't used to having a visual distraction so close to my face i.e. my eyes didn't know where to focus.

Head tracking was not a problem but forward motion - ouch! backward motion - OUCH! and strafing - OH YOU F@#*!!!

Tuscany or pretty much any demo that involved full body motion made me feel instantly dreadful. 10 min in half life meant 2 hours on the sofa regretting it. I tried ginger (raw), ginger ale, chewing gum and motion sickness tablets but none had a significant effect.

I was resigned to feeling completely underwhelmed by the rift (no magical teleportation sensation or heart-pounding adrenaline rush)

The good news (for me and I hope others) is that one week later and I can most definitely see the light at the end of the tunnel. I still get motion sickness but not nearly on the same scale.

I found the following, which may help others:

(Use correct lens but honestly I have tried 3 different profiles with different IPDs and can't tell the difference)

1) Allow your brain get used to the 'wearing glasses' disorientation. Do not overload our brain with sensory information. Get used to 360 head tracking before motion. Proton pulse is excellent for this. Also just looking around Tuscany demo without moving is good. Once it feels normal move on to....

2) Any slowly moving seated simulator. Titans of space is great (although it took me a few days to appreciate it- at first I found it underwhelming but now I find it near mind-blowing). Playing seated and being seated in VR really helps sync your body with your mind - very important with reducing motion sickness.

also - do not move your head in ways that cannot be replicated in VR i.e. forward leaning etc.. instant sickness!

3) As recommended by so many: Hydra Cover Shooter. This sold the rift to me. It made realise that games like Halo / gears of war could actually work on the rift and that the rift could give you a pretty great work out. Hydra calibration is essential here (the trick is positioning the chest piece just right - high and central helps). This works against motion sickness for two reasons:
a) Positional tracking (not perfect but a very commendable effort and good enough for now).
b) Having things to shoot really takes your mind off how your body is feeling.

4) Get your VR legs slowly. Tuscany 'training' demo. This person has offered the experience using a small circle that gives a narrow field of view. Instantly easier for your mind and stomach to cope with. I just practiced walking forwards and backwards. When I felt comfortable I switched to full Tuscany demo and found that I no longer had instant motion sickness. This was very encouraging.

5) As for full games I have tried: half-life 2, dear esther, skyrim and borderlands 2. All induced nausea (though less so now). The first to try is definitely borderlands 2. The expansive environment and far reaching draw distance (with few indoor corridors) makes it much easier for the mind to cope with. (Standing for all games where the character is standing is highly recommended - one less thing for your mind to cope with) After your brain can handle this - sitting down becomes possible. At first sitting down felt like I was seated on a floating umpire's chair - very awkward. Indoor environments are harder to cope with because objects rush past your periphery faster which can quickly lead to disorientation).

So to sum up. 

One week in - about 20-30 min a day (yep - not over-doing it is also important) and I definitely feel I am winning the battle against motion sickness. As a result I am now feeling far more immersed and that feeling of being teleported has started to happen (I thought people were being OTT but I can now see how it feels like that).
Moving my head is completely comfortable now. Strafing and turning using a controller are having a significantly lower impact. I am yet to conquer moving in confined detailed spaces but I am sure I will get there.

Also - remember that this is the worst it will ever be! Positional tracking / higher resolution / Omni treadmills etc... these will all help sync the mind with the body and kill motion sickness.

I hope this has helped those about to put their rift on ebay...

1369881439.0,55,self.oculus,1fb8t1,Rifter Raw First Impression,59,4,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1fb8t1/rifter_raw_first_impression/,"Well the Rift arrived today and I wanted to give a first impression while the reactions are still fresh. Opening the box was surreal. I kept asking myself ""Is this real? Is this really happening?"" The C lenses worked best (nearsighted here). Display as close to my eyes as possible. In order to get the sweet spot of visual sharpness the Rift had to be placed low on my face/cheek, which I didn't expect.

Tuscany loads up and I half-peek into the lenses. It looks just like the youtube videos and closeup pics. So I think I know what to expect. Next the Rift is fully on now and I'm confused. My brain was expecting one thing but it felt different. People have said over and over ""You can't really explain what it's like,"" and it's true. It's not explainable. The closest analogy would be like stepping into a portal to a different place. It's 99% complete immersion. After 20 minutes walking around no headaches or nausea. On to the next demo.

Riftcoaster! This was the one that's been all over youtube. So many reactions. Maybe my expectations were too high. It's a great demo but I didn't feel the stomach churning at the first big drop like most people do. Seeing it dozens of times in 2d might remove the excitement when it's actually tried in 3d. Riftcoaster version 2 will probably kick my ass though.

VR Cinema was exciting. If you don't have a 3D tv, 3D lcd, go to 3D movies then VR Cinema will be hypnotize you. I watched 3D animated microbiology videos from youtube and an Avatar clip, like 10x each. A full 3D movie would be completely watchable even with the current Rift screen res. Actually being in a fully rendered theater and comfy seats felt oddly nice, like your own private theater.

Arch Viz Rift is a platform in the middle of an ocean with walls, beams, roofs that fly around forming into differently shaped buildings. Interesting to watch walls and pillars fly around in the air like they're possessed by a ghost architect. And then you see a wall fly right at you, or a roof fall from the sky right on top of you, and you crap your pants. This is the first demo to give you me that ""WTF"" moment.

At this point guessing that I'm one of the lucky people who don't get motion sickness using the Rift. It's been about an hour. Which next Half Life 2 or Skyrim? I used to be one of those Skyrim players with 150+ mods so we gotta go with Skyrim first. Install Vereio Perception drivers, edit the ini files, load up a save. Wow! Jaw-dropping. This takes the #1 spot so far. Then I fix the FOV. Unbelievable. The sense of 3D is good. What makes this so great is that Skyrim has a high immersion factor even on a flat 2D lcd screen. Adding 3D and head tracking is overpowering. Doors and city gates feel like real solid doors and gates. NPCs that stare can make you feel uncomfortable. And there's a real sense of personal bubble/space. It feels creepy when an NPC walks up next to you and stands 2 inches away. Combat is improved for Skyrim with the Rift. A wolf lunging at your character feels like a real wolf lunging at you, making my second ""WTF Oh Crap!"" moment. With the current screen resolution things in the distance are blurry and sometimes hard to identify. The indoors are much better because the close surroundings make the 3D really shine. NPCs with big scars on their faces make you think ""Woah! Dude, what happened to you?!"" We didn't encounter any dragons. Although I'm freaked out by a lunging wolf. Might not be ready for dragons. Then the nausea starts kicking in. Just a bit. I'm thinking ""Oh no... time to go."" In other reactions people have said if you don't take off the Rift as soon as you sense nausea or headache it can get much much worse. Some of Skryrim's 3D settings might need to be fine tuned. There was an Nvidia Surround 3D mod to improve the 3D offsets that I didn't have time to install, so definitely will for next time. My sister tried the Tuscany, Riftcoaster, and VR Cinema demos. She thought they were amazing and tried to reach out and touch the virtual environment a few times.

Next we start up Team Fortress 2 to calibrate and get IPD (interpupillary distance) settings and then copy those over to the Half Life 2 configuration file. At this point my nausea is telling me that Half Life 2 will have to wait. It's definitely going to rank up there with Skyrim from reading other people's reactions.

TLDR (edit): I thought I knew what the Rift would be like but I had no idea. Some demos that I thought would shock me were just OK. Some that I thought would just be OK really shocked me. Skyrim and Half Life 2 (and possibly Minecraft mod) kick ass. The nausea is real (you will most likely not be one of the lucky few un-nauseated).",,False,self,t5_2uni5,1369881631.0,,,True,t3_1fb8t1,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1fb8t1/rifter_raw_first_impression/,

Around 5 hours after a short chat over PM, I got the tracking info for the shipment.

Today, it came in the mail.

I just really want to thank Palmer and all the guys at Oculus for getting it straightened out.

It seems that the original Rift had actually shipped out in March, and because it was using my APO address had to be shipped via US Postal Service. The tracking system seems to have a bug with updating orders if shipped via USPS, which is why it still said my order was Processing.

If it shipped out in March, I think it's safe to say that my original Rift had gotten lost in transit. Thankfully Palmer was there to save the day.

That was something! I've been pretty active on here since the beginning so I've kind of been worrying that I set the bar a bit too high for my first experience. Turns out I didn't, because it felt nearly like what I was expecting it to feel. I won't go into too much detail because you've most likely heard it all before, or you're already playing with your own Rift seeing as how many have gone out. 

So far I've spent about 30 minutes in it. I'm a tad nauseous so I'm going to take a break and pick it up tomorrow (I would do it more today but I have prior obligations--the Rift arrived at a bad time!)

**Resolution**

**EDIT: For some reason unbeknownst to me when I started running HL2 with the Rift, it went to default settings. This means it was running no Anti-Aliasing and all lowest settings. After beefing up the AA and everything else, the game looks A LOT better in the Rift and my complaints regarding resolution/ghosting have basically been sliced in half at zero performance hit--not that I was even really complaining...** 

Didn't bug me that bad. It's basically like playing with a fencing helmet on. Once you get used to wearing it, the pixels disappear. The ""jaggies"" that come with low resolution were the first thing I noticed when firing up the Tuscany demo, however the sensation I felt immediately after that was the sensation of actually being in the place. I really felt like I was there. 

**Ghosting**

It's noticeable. I've been very optimistic about the Rift on here and am very biased in general, however I can be impartial while writing this. The ghosting is an issue but it doesn't kill the experience by any stretch. When I was in the cafeteria in the beginning of Half-Life 2, I looked from one wall to the other rather quickly and immediately felt the scene stretch a bit (like a motion blur). However, the very instant you stop moving it settles and the details come back out. Basically, it's an issue but you can still have a great experience in spite of it. 

**Tracking &amp; Immersion**

The tracking is perfect. I seriously can not notice any delay at all. I've thrown my head around quite a bit too which is saying something. 

The immersion is the big thing. **You really feel like you're in another place while wearing the Oculus Rift**. I've played through Half-Life 2 numerous times and this is the first time I've really felt like I was there--so it was a bit jolting when guards took swings at me with their shock sticks. I had the brilliant idea of throwing a can at the guard's face and when he approached me it gave me a pretty solid fright. 

Despite Half-Life 2's aging graphics, the immersion is really there. When characters look at you, it's as if actual people are looking at you. It's creepy is what it is! It's hard to disconnect yourself from the experience if you're wearing stereo headphones and the Rift. 

**tl;dr** It met my expectations. I'm as optimistic for the Rift and VR and general as I ever was, and that's being totally impartial. I now understand what the hype was about.

If you're not a developer or really passionate about VR or don't have money lying around though, I do recommend holding out on the devkit. Despite being a very solid unit with a very finished feel, you really only get about a year with it before something much, much, much better comes along.

Check out my [Road To VR article](http://www.roadtovr.com/2013/04/27/cymatic-bruce-doom-3-bfg-oculus-rift-support-5327) for the detailed breakdown!

The first time many of us heard about the Rift was through the bold words of John Carmack: ""I believe I have the best VR Demo ever made."" That early Rift prototype, held together with duct tape and hope, was impressing people left and right with a modified version of Doom 3 BFG. Excited backers were elated to learn that Doom 3 BFG was promised as a pack-in when the Kickstarter launched. Unfortunately, that was not to be.

For those that dreamed of playing Doom up close and personal, have no fear! The Doom 3 source code was released, and the VR dev community tackled the challenge of integrating Rift support. I decided to give this a shot in my latest video. Here is my experience!

My coworker however has an aunt that just had her leg amputated due to cancer. She is having some very bad phantom leg pains. I know simple VR environments that show the missing leg move some how cause the brain to calm down and stop sending the pain signal. I'm sure there is a lot to the therapy, but I was wondering if any one has seen any applications that she could use. Probably none exist for the Rift yet but I have my hopes any dev with a huge heart out there can do her a huge favor and just take 30 mins to create a scene where you are sitting in, that you could strap a hydra controller to her good leg and use that input to show both legs raise and lower mapped just to the leg the hyrdra is strapped to. I know its a long shot but if I could just do that alone getting the Dev Kit would of been more then worth it. Thanks in advance for any one even considering helping in providing an app that already exist and especially if some one takes the time to code a quick app!

1375884420.0,46,self.oculus,1jvtdu,Impressions from Neogaf: Wheelchair user 'FaustsBoon' receives his Oculus Rift – and is thoroughly blown away.,51,5,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1jvtdu/impressions_from_neogaf_wheelchair_user/,"[Source, all courtesy of Neogaf user FaustsBoon](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=75069863&amp;postcount=3929)

&gt;Wow... Just received my kit. Set it up. I've only had five-ten minutes with it, and the Rift Rollercoaster... but I can already tell this thing will be special.
&gt;
&gt;That said, I couldn't fit it with my glasses in without pushing the lenses ALL the way back which severely hurts the illusion, and without my glasses, I am soooo near-sighted that it was impossibly blurry.
&gt;
&gt;After breakfast i'll try popping in the ""C Cup"" inserts for the severely near-sighted, and hopefully that will help.
&gt;
&gt;I'll report in later. 

***6 hours later ...***

&gt;Holy shit balls...
&gt;
&gt;I'll post more lengthy and thorough thoughts tomorrow, but DAMN.
&gt;
&gt;After realizing the lenses could be pushed ""in"" far more than I thought, I went back to A-cups, plus glasses. It was the secret sauce I needed because... wow.
&gt;
&gt;So, i'm going to be another of these voices that I recall hearing before owning a Rift. I read impression after impression, and every time I thought... ""Surely it can't be that cool. I mean... people are hyped and its normal to exaggerate... right?""
&gt;
&gt;No... No it really isn't.
&gt;
&gt;Until you've not only used Rift, BUT also found ""Your"" game... the experience doesn't set in.
&gt;
&gt;I tried Rift-Coaster first. It was very, very cool... but the resolution and such keeps it from being quite as gut-churning as I expected. That said, mileage may vary. My mom and Dad respectively got ten seconds in, and their fear of heights made me stop immediately. I honestly had more fun tormenting my old parents than I did with the demo. ;-)
&gt;
&gt;Tried Tuscany next. I was MUCH more impressed. You realize quickly that using the Rift, the illusion is very much linked to things you wouldn't suspect, like ""scale"". Tuscany felt like being in a different world. Amazing stuff. My first bit of OR stomach rumble did come from playing like an FPS however. Strafing, or adjusting your view with your mouse, until you have VR legs is indeed the moment you might start feeling off.
&gt;
&gt;Blue Marble and Titans of Space were next... and I will, without shame, suggest that both, especially BM, brought a tear to my eye. It was a liberating, transcendent moment for a guy in a wheelchair since birth. The music, everything... It was a special experience which I will never forget.
&gt;
&gt;And then... still feeling very, very little discomfort, I jumped into Minecrift. TERRIBLE and glorious mistake. It was ""MY"" Oculus Rift moment. The world... the world was infinitely huge, and I have never felt so fundamentally ""in"" a game before. For me, that play-session changes everything... everything... about how I want to experience virtual worlds in the future...
&gt;
&gt;It was also Minecraft that gave me some serious motion sickness. Everyone says to skip it... to stick to guided tours for day 1 through 3 or so.... but I couldn't resist.
&gt;
&gt;Jumping down into a huge cavern.... INSANE.
&gt;
&gt;Other tiny observations... my lenses kept fogging up after extended use. Not sure what to do about that.
&gt;
&gt;Also, downsampling from a higher resolution is a good idea, calibrating your IPD is a mandatory item, and yes... the resolution is mediocre, but it isn't a fanboy thing to say that your brain tunes it out. Ten minutes in Minecraft and I was too busy feeling the magnitude of what was around me to notice much else.
&gt;
&gt;Listen... i'm not their target audience. I have a limited range of motion, can't look behind myself, etc... I'm not the guy who is going to reap the best benefits from VR. That said... this tech, in some fashion, be it soon, or further down the road, changes everything. This, in some perfected form is the next ""internet"". It feels like the thing that changes how we interact with media, learning (IE Titans of Space... wow, imagine kids on that field trip?), etc...

1370479496.0,45,self.oculus,1frcbw,My Oculus Rift first impressions - Just in case you're still interested in reading them,49,4,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1frcbw/my_oculus_rift_first_impressions_just_in_case/,"I received my Rift yesterday. As one of the last kickstarter backers, I remember reading just about everything that everyone had to say about the rift and so I'd like to add my 2 cents. Please bear with me as my finger is broken and typing is difficult.

The first thing I did when I got home from work was fire up the Tuscany demo. I wear glasses; I'm nearsighted with a prescription of -5.5. I did not wear my glasses for my first go, nor did I change from the default eyecups. ""Screw it, it'll be blurry"" I said to myself. I put the rift on.

Woah.

The first thing I noticed was indeed the sense of scale. I could see objects around me, and they looked like they were really next to me. They were the right size. Without my glasses I couldn't really discern the actual pixels and everything looked blurry just like real life. This it turns out was actually masking the limitations of the display from me. After looking around for a minute, I went to the bathroom and put my contacts in. When I came back, suddenly I could see the pixels. All of them. It wasn't so bad, the whole experience is still unlike anything I've ever seen before. But the pixels are noticeable. I spent 20 minutes just wandering around the demo and looking at things.


Next I fired up the rollercoaster demo. I just about fell out of my chair. The sense of vertigo was extremely strong. My brain really thought I was about to go down a huge drop, and despite not having the dropping sensation, I still tensed up in anticipation, leaned backwards to compensate, and just about lost my balance. It was a really surprising experience - I didn't expect it to feel so... real.

Then I tried out the Blue Marble demo and while it was nice, I didn't really find it particularly interesting.

Lastly, I fired up the Proton Pulse block-breaking game. That was very cool. Rather than simulating some sort of environment, I felt like I was in something more abstract. Everything came very naturally to me and I enjoyed it until the game itself grew a little boring.

At this point my ex-girlfriend came over, and so I had her try it. I put her in the Tuscany demo and she just kept repeating ""oh wow. Oh wow!"" as she wandered through the area. She is very susceptible to motion sickness though so this was the only demo she tried. She said it was really neat. She doesn't like gaming or technology though so that's where the conversation ended.

Today I had my coworker over to try it out. He knows about the Rift and has been following its developments loosely, and he said ""I expected it would be pretty cool, but this is way more awesome than I thought!"" [Here he is trying the rollercoaster demo.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkO5UcPHR0U)

Today I tried the Tuscany demo again. At one point, one of the little floating thingies floated into where my mouth was and I instinctively tried to blow it away. I also tried out the Rift Racer demo which also is really fun, however I did a few too many barrel rolls and began to not feel well, so I decided to take a break and write this.

A few points:

* Display - You've heard this already. The resolution is low. But they're going to fix that. There is a bit of blurriness when things move quickly, but it's not a big deal.
* Tracking - super fast. I did not perceive any lag.
* My Rift has a stuck pixel, in the upper center of the left eye. It's *slightly* annoying, but not a big deal. I don't see it most of the time.
* Tuscany Demo has some screen tearing
* As some people have mentioned, things look a LOT better if you select a higher resolution. I choose 1080p whenever possible. Running on the native resolution causes a great deal of aliasing, it was especially noticeable on the trees in the Tuscany demo.
* Positional tracking is really needed. I found myself continually trying to lean over ledges, or bend down to look at something.

Overall I'm quite impressed with this package, and I look forward to seeing what applications people come up with. However the display is currently lacking and without built-in positional tracking it doesn't feel quite... complete.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1frcbw,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1frcbw/my_oculus_rift_first_impressions_just_in_case/,

1365291215.0,43,self.oculus,1btne8,Rift (and VR) first impressions.,50,7,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1btne8/rift_and_vr_first_impressions/,"I posted that my Rift arrived yesterday, so I thought I should also follow up with what I thought after using it:

**Oculus Rift - First Impressions**

First and foremost, I’m a consumer. I’ve never done software development and I’ve never experienced any type of VR before. When I saw the kickstarter, I realized I needed to be a part of this, even if I can’t create content for the device. So these first impressions are not only of the Oculus Rift, but also of VR in general.

First and foremost, it’s a pretty amazing thing. Strapping the goggles into place and firing up the Tuscany demo, I didn’t know what to think. I actually had tried to dial back my excitement for using the Rift. I knew that it was going to be low resolution. I’d heard things about the the “screen door effect” where you could see lines in between pixels. If I hyped this up too much, I knew I was just going to be disappointed. So what was this experience going to be like?

It took me a second to adjust after I opened my eyes and looking around. First, it felt like I was looking through binoculars to view the world. You don’t really have peripheral vision. That said, it doesn’t feel like you are looking at a screen either, just peering into another world. My eyes can look up and down, left and right, and focus on different parts  of the scene. I can judge depth, gauge distance. I guess you can compare it to holding your hands up to the sides of your eyes and looking around that way. Or maybe like scuba diving and looking out your mask(*note, this would be amazing! get on it devs). This wasn’t a monitor, it was a view into another world.

I started to move around with my xbox controller. I walked straight up to the doorframe and I flinched back as I almost hit  wall. I physically flinched in my chair. My mind was fooled into thinking I was going to hit something. I turned around and went up the stairs in the manor. My stomach lurched a bit as my mind tried to understand why I wasn’t feeling the sensation of vertical movement.

 I made my way onto the balcony upstairs. I leaned my head back on my chair and looked at the roof of the building and the sky. I hit the joystick and began to turn in circles. For a moment I felt like I was on a playground, laying on a spinning wheel as it gently turned me in circles. I felt like I was revolving, spinning in my chair, but physically motionless. I probably sat there for 30 seconds just looking at the sky and spun. I’ve never felt this way in a game.

I also tried the Museum of the Microstar and TF2. The museum was great, but the movements seemed a little off. I had to keep resetting my position because I had problems returning to facing straight forward. With headphones on I was immersed. Here I was wandering around a crazy museum looking at things, all alone in a huge cave. A roommate came up behind me as I was walking about and asked me how it was. I almost jumped out of my chair. I was supposed to be alone in a museum! I took off my headset and I was turned around 180 degrees facing a wall. 

TF2 was fun, and has some really neat effects. Just being able to turn my head and look at the rocket launcher on my shoulder was really cool. I wanted to reach out and touch it. The game itself is a bit less immersive though. Because you are facing forward most of the time and using the mouse and keyboard, it doesn’t feel quite like you are actually in the game. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a lot of fun, but I just want to be plopped into a virtual world and be set free to explore.

Overall, yes, you do notice the resolution, the blurring, screen tearing (not sure if it was just a v-sync option I couldn’t find), and the screen door effect. As long as you don’t get hung up on those minor quibbles, and realize that this is an early prototype, it’s amazing. You can look past these things and use your imagination, and you can feel almost as if you are transported away. It can be a window into a new world that will only get better.

As a consumer, not a developer, I agree that it’s probably not at a state that the average person should purchase yet. This is mainly due to the low-res screen. Do I regret buying it? Hell no, this is amazing! I will tell every person I meet that I have a Rift, and get as many people to test it out as possible. I can’t develop for it, so I can at least spread the word and give as many people their first VR experience as possible.

1374088303.0,44,self.oculus,1ii76g,"Why Metroid Prime would be a compelling, unique Rift adventure",53,9,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1ii76g/why_metroid_prime_would_be_a_compelling_unique/,"So I've been hoping this game would get Rift support at some time, but at the moment nobody is working on it.

I thought I would just write some thoughts on why I want to see this game through the Rift and hoping to get discussion going on it or even just about parts of what I say used in other games.

It is simply a unique game which would function well in the Rift.

**What's unique about Metroid Prime**

*-The World-*

The Metroid Prime (MP) games are first person platformers.  There aren't many other first person platformers out there other than Mirror's edge.  Mirror's edge (ME) is a great game, but is quite different from MP.

ME is a very linear game broken down by missions which take you on one of a few routes from point A to point B.  There is not much exploration to be done.  The whole game takes place in the same environment atop skyscrapers.  

MP is an open world game which encourages you to explore.  Its environments are diverse, spanning from lava fields to icy plains and including space stations, deep mines, and overall unfamiliar alien locations.  Game play is broken up only by cinematic elevator rides between each different environments.  Loading within the individual environments is done behind the scenes for a seamless experience and are only noticeable when a door takes a few seconds to open.

*-Gameplay-*

The gameplay of MP is unique for first person games.  In traditional metroid games, you often have to backtrack and explore places you've been to in order to advance.  Going back through places adds a familiarity to the world and yet you don't look at an area the same way twice because of the accessibility your new power-ups grant you.  MP requires that you pay attention to details in the environment and it's the details that add to the immersion.

**Why is it a good fit for the Rift**

For starters, MP is first person.  First person games are bread and butter for the Rift.  I don't have to elaborate much on this.

A large part of MP gameplay is exploration.  You have to find powerups to advance, backtracking and getting acquainted with the world the game puts you in.  This is what the Rift is for, exploring and experiencing virtual worlds.

There are also many other details which would add to the immersion of using the Rift.  This includes the POV.  Many games and demos for the rift use a POV within a helmet or cockpit to add to the immersion.  In MP your POV is that of within Samus's helmet and the environmental effects really reinforce the feeling you're inside of it.  The glass of the visor fogs up in hot environments, ice crystals form over it in the cold, and even occasionally you get a reflection of your (Samus's) face.  All of this adds to the immersion that you are wearing a helmet.

**Several of the pieces for this to be a Rift game are already there**

Free aim is already implemented natively in the Wii re-release of MP (Aiming decoupled from vision).  It is also already razer hydra ready through a configuration file made for dolphin, the most popular GC / Wii emulator.  

Stereoscopic rendering has already been proven possible for another Gamecube game, [Fzero GX](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5pXFM-XYU) by Biolizard89.  The video linked actually is running on a Wii with modifications using Oracle codes (think like game genie codes).

The only things that need to be implemented are the stereoscopic rendering, headtracking, and adjusting the FOV.  There might also potentially be issues with the HUD needing special rendering.

**Is there any sort of progress being made?**

There's still some activity on [the dolphin oculus rift support thread](https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-oculus-rift-support) pertaining to specific projects for several individuals.  

At some point, CarlKenner posted in that thread about progress he was making specifically for metroid prime Rift but he hasn't posted in the forum for several months.  I've tried getting in contact with him but with no success.

By adding HL2 to the Rift line-up Valve single handedly made the BEST VR game available right now.

I've rabidly followed every bit of news for it since, and my obssession with it probably started getting on the nerves of some people I know. So yes, you could certainly say I was hyped for the Rift without even seeing it, and that's something that doesn't happen easily for me these days. However, with each new video, I was getting more excited, and more than anything, was probably setting myself up for a massive amount of disappointment if I wasn't impressed when I finally got my Rift.

Anyway, the first demo upon arrival of my new toy was the Tuscany villa. Frankly, I was gobsmacked. I'd read so much about the massive size of the pixels, in my mind I'd overinflated how big they would be. Now, that's not to say they are small (more in on the screen in a bit) but the first impression was that I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I'd played quite a lot of 4 player Legend Quest in the 90's in Nottingham (I still have the [leaflets](http://i557.photobucket.com/albums/ss19/FlukeRogi/LegendQuest_zpsd26711dc.jpg) from there) and this suddenly evoked strong memories of that, except that this time, well, it worked. Properly. This was life sized VR. I was genuinely stunned.

After wandering around the villa for a few minutes, I started to notice the pixels. Actually, it fairer to say I got over my shock of the scale of what I was seeing which allowed me to take things in. Some people say the resolution isn't too bad, some that the screen door isn't an issue and that you'll mentally block it out once you immerse yourself in an experience (and yes, experience is the correct word).

I was expecting the low resolution, and given that, it didn't bother me to any great extent. However, what is a problem in my view is the screendoor effect - the gaps between the pixels. I simply can't ignore the effect - it's extremely obvious, and I cannot grasp how people say they can ignore it as it's too pronounced. Motion blur is apparent, but it's lower down the list of issues for me, certainly below the resolution or screendoor effect. However, the sense of immersion outweighs the current flaws of the dev-kit. It also seems to for eveyone I've demoed my Rift to.

I've shown it to 10 people so far, 7 of who are gamers, and I've not had one person say they weren't impressed. You can tell by their very verbal reactions, their mouth simply hanging open, and the genuinely amazed look when they take it off.

However, I hadn't had anything approaching the over the top reactions that I'd seen in many of the videos, but given I'd been showing everyone who came round all the various YouTube clips from the past several months, I think that may have softened the impact. That changed yesterday however when I decided to pop round to my neighbour (who I know to chat to, but not socially). He has a young lad, so I guessed that there was at least one gamer in their family, and they promptly came round to try my new ""games device"" (I didn't tell them exactly what it was, just that I had something new that they might be interested in seeing).

While his son really enjoyed the Rift, it was his dad that finally gave me the reaction I'd seen in the videos. I had him put it on when it was still displaying the Windows desktop to make sure he could clearly see the pixels that made up the image, even though you can't make out the desktop correctly.

Then I loaded up Tuscany, and he jumped back in his chair. He was blown away, saying he couldn't believe what he was seeing. After a couple of minutes, I loaded up the Riftcoaster, and he was leaning all over the place and laughing his head off. If you have a Rift, and haven't had an extreme reaction yet, I strongly recommend trying to find someone who you haven't told about the Rift, and who has never heard of it. It's better than giving someone a christmas present - you're showing them something utterly new, giving them an experience they've never had. As good as it is, it really is even better to share.

As mentioned near the start of this post though, there is a bit of a way to go. After using it for five days now and playing some actual games (namely HL2 and TF2), the shortcoming of the Rift are apparent. It needs a bigger screen (Oculus have repeated said it will have one on release), and the screendoor effect needs to be massively diminished. Will a 1080p be enough? I'm not sure, but the other thing to bear in mind is that the release version will in all likelyhood be a 5.5inch screen like the original prototype. That means that the effective PPI will be increased before you take the increase in actual screen resolution into account. I have a feeling it will be enough for a first consumer release, but saying that, we'll only know when it actually launches (or maybe if there's actually a dev-kit 2).

If you haven't tried a Rift yet, keep an open mind until you've had one strapped to your head. This isn't a Virtual Boy, despite people on some forums claiming it is (and guess what, they're the same people who haven't tried it). I'll leave you with a post from someone on AVForums, a racing sim fan who uses a triple monitor setup, who after trying the Rift for a few days said he was going back to his monitors. However, the following day he posted this:

""...the first thing I noticed back on my 3 screens was that I knew I was sitting in my room with 3 screens around me. I could see everything in my peripheral vision, my coffee cup, my remote control for the amp, a bit of cabling here, the top of the rig where the roof meets the screens, keyboard stands etc etc and all I could think of was that when in the oculus, I felt like I was in the actual cockpit.""

Before even getting in to my review, [thanks, Madcow!](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly6d7kxZzO1r5prb1.gif)
 
So here we go.
 
 
**The Oculus Rift headset.**
 
Although I've been following the Rift since the beginning, this was my first time physically handling one and was pleasantly surprised to see how light it feels. I had assumed the head-mounted display would be a little heavier. It manages to be lightweight without feeling too plastic-y or cheap. After a moment or two I pretty much forgot I was wearing it. The headstrap was comfortable (after a little jockeying around the ears,) and the padding at no point felt too constricting. I did notice a tiny amount of light seeping through near my nose, but it was quickly forgotten.
 
My first impression when seeing the screen door effect was *""That's it? I don't see what all the fuss is about.""* I'd say the ""screen door"" comparison is an apt one, although much like looking through a screen for any period of time it soon became an afterthought - I was too busy looking around at the virtual landscapes to dwell on it.
 
Although I've watched a ton of demo videos, I was still amazed at the latency and FOV. It really does an exceptional job at moving with you and it all feels completely natural. Gauging your IPD was a simple easy process.
 
**Rift demos.**
 
Madcow ran me through a bunch of demos, including a few I'd never seen. I'm going to give some impressions of some but not all of them, particularly those that stood out in my memory.
 
We started with [Deep Sea Dive](http://www.mastersofpie.com/blog/?p=26). The moment when I'm told over the radio that something big is approaching to my left (which turned out to be a blue whale) was mind-blowing. It was only the fact that I was fully aware it was a Rift demo which kept me from reaching out and trying to touch it. When the shark attacked me head-on I had a natural sense of the depth and it's speed, and involuntarily let out a little yelp. 3 minutes in and the technological limitations were completely gone from my mind.

Next up was a demo of a hentai-ish woman in a revealing pink catsuit; I don't recall seeing this demo before, but when Madcow told me to walk up close to her it definitely felt like I was invading her personal space (and in turn was having mine invaded.)
 
[Fantasy Night](http://www.riftenabled.com/admin/app/210) was beautiful to explore, and the ""personal space"" effect was also quite strong here. I remember thinking how fun walking around the world of [Proteus](http://www.visitproteus.com/) would be, or the water in the beginning of Bioshock.
 
The [Virtual Cinema](http://www.riftenabled.com/admin/app/29) was great. I had just seen Pacific Rim the day before in a theater very similar to the one in the demo, and it seemed perfectly natural and fairly realistic.
 
I'm going to agree with a lot of other first impressions I've read and join the *""[Titans of Space](http://www.riftenabled.com/admin/app/208) is amazing and awe-inspiring""* camp. I think more than any other demo this one really explored and exploited the Rift's ability to make you feel like you're in another world. I remember thinking when I looked down at my legs: *""Huh. I don't remember putting those pants on today.""* It was only a brief thought, but it was brilliant. It speaks to the Rift's potential to be a platform for *experiences,* rather than just games. It all felt wonderfully epic. The fact that I was resigned to sitting and being brought on a guided space tour just added to the reality of the situation. I had a sense of wonder due to the size and scale of the planets and moons. Very, very cool.
 
[Frequency Domain](http://www.riftenabled.com/admin/app/195) was delightful in it's simplicity. Tilt your head and you move from side to side. Aim for the peaks in the music and you're launched into the air. Fun for all ages.
 
[Disunion](http://www.riftenabled.com/admin/app/132) was a short and unique experience. It does exactly what it says it will. Neat.
 
[Half-Life 2](http://www.riftenabled.com/admin/app/153) was one of the games I **really** wanted to play. I heard about coming into City 17, and the effect it's dystopia has on players, and I wasn't disappointed. Wallace Breen has a massive Big Brother presence. Interacting with NPCs resonates on an emotional level. The Combine seem all the more threatening (I picked up the can.) It felt very much like being in the world of Terry Gilliam's *Brazil,* but with less art deco costuming. The buildings feel massive, the rooftops (and the look down) are scary, and it really feels like you're inside that world. The panopticon-like Citadel really does feel 2.5 kilometers tall. Seriously. It was awesome. Go play it if you haven't.
 
**Conclusions.**
 
Ultimately, the Rift was pretty much everything I wanted it to be. Reading text in games like TF2 was a bit disorienting, and weapon switching in Doom 3 was a little awkward for me - but other than that, **it delivers.** Yes there were a few places where it was rough around the edges, but as Oculus has demonstrated, they're not going to release until they've ironed out as many kinks as humanly possible. If, when it's released commercially it's both HD and wireless, I'd be shocked if it didn't takes it's place as an integral part of PC gaming - and sitting comfortably next to the big 3 consoles. Personally I think it's more likely it will become a fully realized medium all on it's own.
 
Once again, all thanks to Madcow199 who was a helpful instructor and a patient host.
 
Now if only some developer would get to work on a *Neuromancer* game...

**EDIT 8:50AM EST 07.31.13:** I should also mention that I was wearing headphones while playing. I think it's safe to say it adds to the immersion.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,1375275080.0,,,True,t3_1jcikj,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1jcikj/rift_first_impressions/,
1374823328.0,43,self.oculus,1j325q,World of Warcraft and the sense of scale,49,6,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1j325q/world_of_warcraft_and_the_sense_of_scale/,"Put on your nostalgia hats because I'm going back in time:

I started playing World of Warcraft back before any expansions.  Back in the days of vanilla, when things like leveling to 60 and coming up with 600 gold for an epic mount seemed like impossible tasks.

Back then, the entire world was brand new, overwhelmingly huge and I traversed a majority of it all by foot.  I had never experienced anything like that before.  I started off as an undead mage and I was terrible at it.  I spent what must have been weeks questing in those first and second undead areas with my terrible gear only to realize that not only was there an giant Undercity, but there were quests leading me south into an area far, far larger than I had just quested in.  I couldn't believe the scale.

But you know what?  After 6 years of playing, not a single expansion has immersed me like I was those first few months.  They've tried.  They've tried every time by limiting flying in new expansions but faster and faster mounts meant the world got smaller and smaller.  More and more flight paths and portals meant more beautiful landscapes were completely skipped over.  And I realize that the artists put thousands of hours each into creating all of that content and the quest writers did the same.  But they shot themselves in the foot by letting us be lazy.  What's the point of creating epic worlds if you just let people bypass it?

So that then brings me to the Oculus Rift.  For the last 6 years i've wanted to step foot into Azeroth and really be there and I'll soon be able to.  

In playing the game, I've gone into the Undercity thousands of times and always in 3rd person view.  Well, today I was looking at some old in-game screenshots and one was of my character standing at the undercity bank.  I never noticed this while playing because my perspective was always skewed, but the center of that city is absolutely massive.  My character is standing at the bank and is minuscule in comparison to the surrounding architecture.  I always had this mental image of the bank in my mind.  And after looking at my screenshots and some i found online i'm shocked that the whole city is 4-5 times as big as I had thought it was.  I just imagined wearing the Rift and looking up and seeing the ceiling over 100 feet above me.  ...Looking way in the distance to see the other side of room.

So for years I have taken the size and scale of nearly every location for granted.  And I'm really looking forward to re-experiencing that entire world all over again.  I want to walk everywhere.  I want to read every quest text instead of just blindly accepting it.  I want to sit on the rocks overlooking the Arathi Highlands and watch the spiders and dinosaurs roam the countryside... if only they weren't so robotic and repetitive in their movement.  I want to get lost in either that world or another world in some new game.  And even if it isn't perfect, it will still beat staring at a flat screen.

And that, for me, is why this is a game changer.  I know that if I crank the graphics up to the maximum, walk from point a to b and slowly work my way up from 1-60 (maybe further) I will get to see what those artists intended.  Not a bat's eye view, but a carefully crafted world with tiny details and personality.  And that's essentially what all of us are aiming for in gaming and eventually VR.

That same philosophy applies to countless other MMOs like Lord of the Rings Online (beautiful landscapes).  I'd like to get everyone else's take on all of this.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1j325q,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1j325q/world_of_warcraft_and_the_sense_of_scale/,

So, I secured an invite and attended last night's Oculus Kickstarter backer party in San Francisco. Let me get this out of the way first:  
  
There were no dev kits to try out or look at.  
  
This was not a showing, this was a social gathering in every sense. All of the Oculus top brass were there and mingling; there was food, drinks, darts and billiards. I took a [quick (but loud) video of what the scene looked like.](http://youtu.be/9i_oMAe6Rk0) Some highlights:  
  
* Had an awesome conversation about VR benefiting humanity with Simon, a New Zealander living in Norway in town for GDC. From PTSD to phobias to behavior modification. Inspired!  
* Sat down with Andres Hernandez (CyberReality) and talked with him about various things for 40 minutes or so. The conversation touched on the indie community, VR ideas, head and neck modeling, and more. Brilliant guy, a blast to talk with. He will be an incredible community manager.  
* Had a brief conversation with Palmer and Michael Antonov (Chief Software Architect) about VR in educational settings (I am a summer camp director). Palmer is super positive and real easy to talk to. Also, a pretty funny guy. :D   
* Various enthusiastic conversations with other backers about what they plan to do first with their dev kits, along with discussing general ideas.  
  
Overall, it was a fun night. The Oculus staff were incredibly friendly and approachable. I was a little surprised that there were not dev kit demos there, and I wasn't alone - many people I met were KS backers that were either not attending GDC or were unable to get into the booth because of the lines, and were hoping to get a chance to try the Rift. In spite of this, everyone was excited to be there. You could feel the enthusiasm in the room! I would love to see Rift dev gatherings like this in the future.    
  
I get the feeling that this party was giving the Oculus team a chance to unwind a little bit, in addition to allowing KS backers to talk directly with Oculus staff. It is clear that the Oculus guys have been insanely busy and were a bit tired, but they carried on lively conversations with anyone that approached. Its too bad that I didn't get a chance to try it early (no time for GDC), but dev kit should be here in a couple of weeks anyway. Thanks to Oculus for the free food, free drinks, and great conversation!

Riftenabled.com has been running for a couple of months now, with a steady stream of both games as well as users. I put the site together thinking that a couple of rifters might find it useful to have a source where you can find new Oculus Rift demos; I did not however, think that it would become this popular. Thank you for your support, and being so active on the site. 

There is a little problem though. The server I am currently hosting the site on, cannot keep up with demand (which is also why I disabled the hover preview images) – and I have a couple of choices:

1. Find a new paid server where I can host the site (which is scaleable)
2. Find someone who can supply another server for free
3. Take down the site

I really don't want to neither put ads on the site to be able to support a paid server, as the idea from the beginning has been a clean site with no clutter from ads. And I of course don't want to take down the site. I would love to hear if you have any suggestions on how I can continue the site.

Thanks guys!

Out, Kevin

*Edit:
Okay, for now I've set up a CloudFlare account as @FujiwaraTakumi mentioned, and I've also added a Paypal donate button. I am going to see if I get any donations over the next month, and if those donations will be able to support a paid server with the current load. If not, the button will be removed, and I will be looking for another solution.

Due to overwhelming requests from our pledge givers and supporters throughout the gaming community, we are proud to announce Oculus Rift integration into Theme Park Studio. This exciting, cutting edge technology will be included in all versions of the product, with no stretch goal pledges required.

Pantera Entertainment has extensive experience with stereoscopic integration. We have earned Platinum grades on GameGrade3D at www.mtbs3d.com and have also received Nvidia's 5 Star 3D Vision Ready rating.

Besides games, Pantera also develops software for the medical industry. We are the developers behind the Neuro-Vision Rehabilitator software, a product used to treat veterans with impaired vision and balance problems due to traumatic head injuries, a pro duct featured on WCBS news. We also used our engine to develop the 'Computer Orthoptics VTS4'. This software uses 3D stereoscopic functionality extensively, and is currently being used by doctors to treat patients with visual impairments.

We are very excited to announce the merging of our 3D stereoscopic technology into Theme Park Studio. Oculus Rift, integrated into our latest theme park simulation game, is a perfect and inevitable fit. Players will be able to control eye separation and convergence point, allowing them to fine tune their 3D experience and slip into a world of their own creation, and feel like they are actually there.

Imagine walking through your virtual theme park, waiting in line, getting in your coaster, and going on your favorite scream machine, all while being submersed in and surrounded by a stunning virtual experience in stereo 3D. We are happy to do this for those who pledge and support us, with no additional funding required. Oculu s Rift integration is yet another way for TPS to help you to open the gates of your imagination and step into the future. Thank you for helping us make Theme Park Studio an awesome experience and an amazing product.

You wear a headset with a microphone, then when you speak the sound of your voice is reproduced in your headset but with special effects to make it sound like you are really there. 

I.e. you are in a hall in the game, then you would hear your voice as if you were in the hall. 

The game could be really smart about this idea too. The game knows where you are looking so it could know where and how your voice would travel. For example it could replicate echos from nearby walls, depending on which direction your head is facing etc.

Also maybe it could be used as part of the game dynamic too, you could alert guards by shouting in their direction, or communicate with your allies. Lots of possibilities. ",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1h4auh,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1h4auh/voice_idea_for_more_immersion/,

I'm a USC Interactive Media MFA student, and I made this little exploratory game prototype over the course of five days for a class. I added in Oculus support last week and I'd love to get your feedback about it.

You can download it here: **[http://spacewalk.spadille.org/](http://spacewalk.spadille.org/)**

(Mediafire mirrors [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?9pg82yqqb7t5j).)

Here's a quick video capture of the game in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7Sm6fF8vg

Spacewalk is a networked multiplayer experience where you are an astronaut piloting an [EMU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_Mobility_Unit) outside of the International Space Station. Right now the game is purely exploratory and without any goals - I was aiming for a sense of kinesthetic embodiment rather than providing a full game experience.

The controls are non-traditional and I was trying to mimic thruster-based movement rather than typical FPS input. It uses an Xbox 360 controller's left analog stick, triggers, and bumpers. For keyboard and mouse input you can use the QWEASD keys.

I highly recommend this hardware setup: an Oculus Rift, headphones, and an Xbox 360 controller for input. Unfortunately the Xbox 360 controls currently only work on Windows, but I'm working to put them in for Mac OSX.

Thanks for giving it a go, and let me know what you think! I'll be doing a little more work on it over the summer, and I'll take any feedback into account.

(P.S. If you don't have an Oculus there's also a normal screen version available!)

**EDIT: v0.61 bugfix release** - You should now be able to join games without overlapping music and controls with other players!

**EDIT: v0.62 release** - Now there are text notifications showing you how many astronauts are connected!",,False,self,t5_2uni5,1367798871.0,,,True,t3_1dq2ik,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1dq2ik/oculusenabled_student_game_spacewalk/,

I'm wanting to add the Oculus rift to the WSGF.  I need help from the Reddit community for two things:

* What forum(s) sections should we have on the WSGF to support Oculus Rift conversation?  Is one section enough?  Do we need separate sections for gen discussion, hardware questions, game compatibility, etc?  This can always be tweaked in the future, but I'd like to know what the community feels is necessary.
* What criteria should we use for grading support of the Oculus Rift in games?  Granted this may be an initial list, and fully refined after the dev and/or consumer versions release.

Howdy all,

I am skipclarke, the Owner/Founder of the Widescreen Gaming Forum - http://www.wsgf.org.  We are the interweb's largest resource for PC gaming on emerging display technology (widescreen, multi-mon, ultra-wide, and soon VR).  If you're not familiar with the WSGF, see the bottom of this post for info.

I am really excited about the Oculus Rift, probably more so than I have been for things like Eyefinity and 21:9 ultra-wide monitors. I am a Kickstarter backer, and pledged for the developer kit.  I wanted to make sure that the WSGF could provide some of the first impressions and info on the hardware, and begin setting standards and providing fixes for games. 

In preparation for receiving the developer kit, and for the forthcoming public launch, I am working to integrate the Oculus Rift into the WSGF.  Coincidentally (and fortunately) I recently received an email from /r/oculus editor WormSlayer asking if we had any interest in expanding the WSGF to include the Oculus Rift.

I replied that it was already in our plans, but I wasn't sure exactly what would be needed/wanted.  He suggested that I post here to solicit feedback from the Reddit community.  So, here I am...

This integration will mean a few things.  One, we will be adding one or more forum sections to cover various topics.  We will also be developing certification criteria for Oculus Rift support in games.  And, then adding the appropriate data elements to our games database.  These elements will be used to systemically calculate certification, and display various ""views"" of our games database.

* Example of game entry - http://www.wsgf.org/dr/orcs-and-men/en
* Example of games db ""view"" - www.wsgf.org/mgl (All games), http://www.wsgf.org/mgl/ef_s/ (Games with Eyefinity/Surround support)

So, what I need to understand what the Oculus community here on Reddit would like to see in the ways of forum sections, and then the data points / criteria needed for grading Oculus Rift support.  I do realize that some of the data elements and criteria might not be fully determined until after the developer kits (or even consumer kits) are shipped.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I look forward to your input.  I appreciate your support.  March can't come soon enough...

Skip Clarke, WSGF Owner/Founder

###Info on the WSGF

I started the WSGF almost 10 years ago when widescreen displays were first coming on the market.  Since then we've expanded our focus to include multi-monitor gaming (Matrix TripleHead2Go, AMD Eyefinity, NVIDIA Surround, SoftTH, etc.), 21:9 ultra-widescreen and soon 4k displays and the Oculus Rift

The goals of the WSGF are to:

1. Advocate and evangelize PC gaming, particularly emerging display technology
2. Lobby game developers to help get games to work on new and emerging technologies
3. Provide fixes for games that don't work properly in widescreen, multi-monitor (Eyefinity/Surround), 21:9, 4k displays and soon the Oculus Rift
4. Provide information on games, and their support of different display technologies, to help gamers spend their gaming dollars wisely",,False,self,t5_2uni5,1359685533.0,,,True,t3_17nxsq,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/17nxsq/adding_oculus_rift_to_the_wsgf_your_input_needed/,

This project gave over 45,000 people a first exposure to virtual
reality (VR). While we have made  what we consider to be
substantial advances in  HMD  and rendering technology, our
major advances have been in learning  how to  create and
present compelling virtual environments.  We stress that this is
an exercise that requires  both  artistic and engineering  talent
and creativity.

Our  guests completed  written surveys, and  with  subsets we
logged head and carpet motions.  Based on that data and
interviews before, during and after guest flights, we conclude
that:

* Guests suspend  disbelief. The illusion is compelling  enough
that most guests accept being in a  synthetically generated
environment and focus on the environment, not the technology.

* VR appeals to  everyone . Both genders and all ages had
similar responses to  our  attraction.   This  leads us to  conclude
that VR is like feature films in that different content may
segment the market, but the basic technology does  not.  We
also note that  wheelchair guests  find mobility within VR
extremely exciting.

* VR must be  personally  experienced. VR is foreign enough
that most people can not comprehend it without direct personal
experience.

* Fidelity matters. To get most guests to suspend  disbelief
requires extremely  high fidelity.  We provide 60 frames per
second (at the expense of stereo),  for  polygonal models with
hand-painted texture maps, and we do not use hardware
lighting. Texture quality matters much more than  polygon
count.

* Content matters. People love the  experience of  VR, but even
at high fidelity VR by itself is not enough.  The public,  unlike the developers, is not impressed  with  the technology.  In  fact,
the public  assumes that  high  fidelity VR exists and
immediately focuses on  what there is to do in the  synthetic
environment.

* The illusion of  presence is  fragile. Although  guests suspend
disbelief, inconsistencies can instantly shatter the illusion. For
example, objects inter-penetrating, or characters not
responding to the guest’s presence completely shatter the sense
of presence.

* Guests need a  background  story. VR is an overwhelming
experience of being  thrust into a  new  environment.  A  good
way to  soften this transition is to provide a background  story
that familiarizes the guest with the new environment before the
immersion.   This is a  standard technique in theme  park
attractions, typically provided in a pre-show.

* Guests need a goal. Guests need to  know why  they are in the
virtual world and what they are supposed to do.  

* Guests do not turn their heads  much. We were surprised at
how  little people turned their heads in this flight-based
experience.  We attribute this to the mass of the HMD, the
need to look where one is flying,  and guests’ inexperience  with
a head-tracked medium.

* Input controls are hard. We developed a novel  input
mechanism  for  controlling flight.  Since no one  flies  magic
carpets in the real world we could not transfer everyday  skills.

* After many design  iterations we believe that six axis control is
a phenomenally difficult problem and conclude that designers
must limit degrees of freedom.  

* Tell a straightforward story.  As we have learned  with other
intensive media, such as effects laden stereoscopic films and
motion-base simulators,  when the guest is  perceptually
overwhelmed it helps to keep the story short and clear.

* Aladdin is a beginning, not an  end. Our  original goal was to
move past the technology.  Our  first system produces a
compelling illusion and our next efforts are to examine whether
we can tell stories in this new medium.   Our second version of
the project, scheduled  for  release in early 1996, contains a
large number of characters and a narrative story line.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_17bkg9,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/17bkg9/interesting_conclusions_of_disney_aladdin_vr/,

1374478594.0,38,self.oculus,1issx9,I got Tribes : Ascend working! It looks/feels great! Need help trying to to get the crosshair &amp;2d markers tuned for SBS.,44,6,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1issx9/i_got_tribes_ascend_working_it_looksfeels_great/,"I'm really excited about getting this fully functional, great game, I could tell as soon as I put the Rift on in game that it's an awesome fit for XxXtreme VR. The body awareness looking down at your legs while your skiing is nice. Surprisingly when moving at the fastest speeds sliding around the map like a mad man I felt zero motion sickness but I'm pretty tolerant to VR naturally. 

HOW TO:

Use the Stereoificator (I've had a lot more luck with it than the standard Vireio injection driver it's a fork of)
http://www.chrisdrain.com/hmd-stereoificator/

Add this below your last game in the profile.xml:
&lt;profile game_name=""Tribes"" game_exe=""TribesAscend.exe"" shaderModRules=""unreal.xml"" rollEnabled=""true"" worldScaleFactor=""3.5"" /&gt;

Add this after your last game in the users.xml:
&lt;game game_name=""Tribes"" horizontalFoV=""110"" separationAdjustment=""-0.001"" swap_eyes=""true"" yaw_multiplier=""25"" pitch_multiplier=""25"" roll_multiplier=""1"" /&gt;

insert the 3 dlls in your bin into the Tribes Ascend folder that has your TribesAscend.Exe

Set your field of view to 110. Turn off all the hud settings and crosshair for now. Turn your graphics settings in game to the lowest setting (I tried just keeping it high and disabling dynamic shadows, lights, ambient and blur but something still trips up when it's on the highest setting. But, it still looks really good in the Rift with texture detail on high.

Now, trying to get a workable crosshair and get the 2d player, flag, base markers to be kosher with SBS 3D is the only problem. I would gladly play it without, the projectile weapons are fine without a crosshair but spinfusing with a crosshair is already difficult as is. 
It's compatible with 3D Vision. I've read using 3d Vision the crosshair and all the 2d markers are fine. I set 3dVisionEnabled to True in the .ini and tried to launch it with blue red 3dVision, only difference was color changes in the menus.

1373440962.0,39,self.oculus,1hzt4s,"I have an idea for revolutionary tactile feedback gloves that simulate touch, weight, and virtual object solidity, but need some advice.",50,11,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1hzt4s/i_have_an_idea_for_revolutionary_tactile_feedback/,"So I developed a rough design a few years back for thin gloves that can be worn that gives it's users tactile feedback of virtual objects. It uses a very under appreciated technology that I am surprised has been so little utilized in any kind of projects and inventions in general.

Until I realized that the Oculus Rift would actually succeed and herald in VR as an accepted and widespread activity, I had put the project on the wayside.

Not only will the technology in these gloves allow the design to be compact and provide tactile feedback, they will also (to a mild degree) simulate weight, and will also stop the fingers from closing around digital objects that are intended to be solid.

After producing a rough proof of concept I would be able to get some papers signed and collaborate with a team to develop our Kickstarter campaign.

**MY DILEMMA:**

Despite being the creative mind behind this initial design, as I am not an engineer or a chemist I have some questions that need answering. I don't know how to go about getting these questions answered without giving away what it is that makes these gloves special. I don't know how to protect my design from being stolen while finding the right people to help me make the prototype.

I ran into this problem when I started researching what plastics or rubbers to use for the interior of the prototype. It is highly important that they have specific properties for safety reasons.

What is the best way to go about developing something like this and reigning in the talent needed to help the project develop?

I have no friends that have the knowledge I need to fill in the gaps, and because of this I have found myself lost in tedious research several times now.

I wish I could just go to MIT and grab an enthusiast and make them promise to keep a secret.

Should I just detail out the design as much as I can and get some kind of paper for someone to sign before showing it to them?

Thanks so much. I'm so confident I am sitting on something really big here. I just am having trouble on filling in a couple gaps and I don't have people readily available to work with.

Any advice from you guys would be great.

Thanks.

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the replies guys! I just woke up and saw this, I'm heading out to work and then I'll come back later for further discussion.

**Just some background info.**  I am 27 years old, spent most of my life with a focus on Graphic Design, Web Development, and marketing. I currently work marketing for an investment firm. I've mainly done rough draft engineering designs as a hobby as an enthusiast, but I definitely know how to recognize a concept that won't be functional. That being said, there are still a few holes, but I feel like they are small hurdles.

Be back soon thanks guys for all the advice. I'll get a chance to read it when I get back from work.

**EDIT 2:** Hi everyone, sorry I was so late in getting back to my submission. I tried to reply to everyone, there was so much helpful advice, I need to come back shortly and make some more replies. I'm more encouraged now that I feel less roadblocked on legalities and sharing information with the community.'

I'm going to try to put more together, follow the advice in this submission to protect myself, come back and put the plans on the table and see if I'm correct in thinking this is the logical next step in tactile feedback for VR. If so, this would be the community I would want to work with surely.

So I'll see you soon on this! In the mean time, I will float around /r/Oculus and keep up with what is going on. Hoping to get my hands on a devkit soon. :)

1370799945.0,40,self.oculus,1fzonq,[PSA] For games using OpenAL (including Minecraft and anything that runs on Linux) turn on HRTF audio processing!,43,3,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1fzonq/psa_for_games_using_openal_including_minecraft/,"OpenAL is the audio library that a handful of games (but most of the ones on Linux) use for positional audio processing. Now, without HRTF, what you're looking at getting is two arbitrary stereo sources. They only count the audio falloff as it reaches those two sources, giving you barely any sense of direction.

However, HRTF is a technique by which a computer can use a recorded table of how precisely sound is altered as it passes through your ear canal, [relative to its position](http://interface.cipic.ucdavis.edu/images/research/hrir.gif). This tricks your brain into giving you the same audio positioning as real life!

Unfortunately, due to Creative suing to death most/all of the companies putting these capabilities in their sound cards, true positional audio has been somewhat stagnant for quite a while. 

However, with a more recent release of ALsoft (software OpenAL), they added HRTF right into the base framework!

**Linux instructions:**

*System wide:*

For linux users, as long as your ALsoft is reasonably current, all you have to do is this:

    echo ""hrtf = true"" &gt;&gt; ~/.alsoftrc

This should enable it for, well, almost all Linux games, including TF2, L4D2, and Wine games!

But not Minecraft, not quite yet. One more tweak is needed...

*Minecraft:*

Unfortunately Minecraft ships with its own (outdated) OpenAL libs. To fix this, simply do the following:

    ln -sfT /usr/lib/libopenal.so ~/.minecraft/bin/natives/libopenal32.so

Or if on x86_64:

    ln -sfT /usr/lib/libopenal.so ~/.minecraft/bin/natives/libopenal64.so
    ln -sfT /usr/lib/libopenal.so ~/.minecraft/bin/natives/libopenal32.so    

**Windows instructions:**

*System wide:*

For windows, your alsoft.ini is `%AppData%\alsoft.ini`. Edit this file (or create it) and add:

    hrtf = true

Chances are however, your OpenAL is slightly out of date. No worries though, easy to add in. 

[Download and unzip this file.](http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal-soft-1.15.1-bin.zip)

On 32-bit Windows: Copy Win32/soft_oal.dll over C:\Windows\System32\OpenAL32.dll

On 64-bit Windows: Copy Win64/soft_oal.dll over C:\Windows\System32\OpenAL32.dll (Yes I know. The naming was their idea, but it really is the 64-bit dll). Then copy Win32/soft_oal.dll over C:\Windows\SysWOW64\OpenAL32.dll (That's the 32-bit one. Confusing enough yet?)

To get Minecraft running however, make sure you do the following:

*Minecraft:*

Unfortunately, again, Minecraft ships with their older version. No worries though, we just have to do the same there!

Copy Win32/soft_oal.dll over %AppData%\.minecraft\bin\natives\OpenAL32.dll
Copy Win64/soft_oal.dll over %AppData%\.minecraft\bin\natives\OpenAL64.dll

And you're done! Make sure you've got that `alsoft.ini` file there, and find something in Minecraft with positional audio (mob, water source, etc) to test it out!

If your sound card provides an OpenAL32.dll that has capabilities that mesh well with your card better, you may have more luck [replacing it](http://facepunch.com/threads/1077055) with the one provided by your sound card.

Have fun!

[More about HRTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function)

*Note: I think this'll only work (for the moment) with 44.1 Khz audio. If you haven't played with your audio settings at all, it's probably set to that*

**Edit: /u/HathNoro posted instructions for using [custom HRTF tables from a list!](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1fzonq/psa_for_games_using_openal_including_minecraft/cagd3lb) This will give you sound *not measured from a dummy head*!**",,False,self,t5_2uni5,1371092691.0,,,True,t3_1fzonq,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1fzonq/psa_for_games_using_openal_including_minecraft/,

I've been playing Minecrift, and with added positional tracking, the world feels massively more solid and real. I'd previously assumed that being able to lean out, duck down or whatever would just be a minor improvement - but actually, it makes a huge difference to how solid the world feels. 

Particularly when you're doing the uniquely Minecraft thing of sitting in a hole waiting for the sun to come up, being able to peek over blocks makes them feel incredibly solid and ""there"". For the first time in Minecrift, I found myself wanting to reach out and touch the blocks, expecting to feel the earth, almost.

I'm able to get on target a lot faster and that's the most important skill in FPS games.

Just to see how good this mod is, I tried having a go with the Rift Coaster. I finally could see every detail there is, and the 3D effect is MUCH better with the screen door effect gone. The bad thing is, it makes the low resolution of the DK Rift even more apparent! Interestingly, you now see the diffusion array of the privacy screen, instead of the DK Rift's pixels.


**The technicals**:The instruction tells me to adjust the height of the privacy screen but I don't see a point in adjusting the height of the privacy screen, because the border in the middle will push the privacy screen against the Rift screen anyway. However, it is indeed better to have the privacy screen hovering. There needs to be additional instructions, like, the middle border needs to be sanded. I plan to do this later. For now, removing the non-reflective surface helps alleviate the amount of pressure on the privacy screen, but it's not yet enough, it has to be sanded.

Hardest part of the mod seems to be on getting to the screen. I now have broken one of the plastic lever/locks on the Rift, just so that I can put in my butter knife and twist to open the Rift up. Pretty much a mod in itself.

**Final thoughts**: Having a higher pixel density and pixel fill is still better than using a privacy screen. With the privacy screen, you could see the grid array of the privacy screen itself. However, HD Rift isn't going to come any time soon, so give this mod a go, it's great!

1372426699.0,33,self.oculus,1h8w9r,My idea for a kind of game that can only exist in VR--what are yours?,40,7,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1h8w9r/my_idea_for_a_kind_of_game_that_can_only_exist_in/,"I just daydreamed one up and I was wondering if anyone else has thought of any other ones. 

I was thinking about ways to have authentic storytelling experiences in VR. I think the trick to it is to emphasize the fact that you're actually in a real place and create an atmosphere and a real sense of presence that go beyond what is currently possible in gaming. In the 'game' I had in mind, the player could move through a series of connected set pieces that served the same role as scenes in a movie, wherein one set piece advanced the plot through character development and the next advanced the plot through action. 

However the idea of merely cut, copying and pasting the traditional FPS formula doesn't appeal to me at all. A story that followed a believable pace, that was linear to an extent but open enough to give the player choices in dialogue and during action sequences.

Mechanically, I was thinking it would have to go something like this: 

- Make the most of positional tracking, create a realistic ""body"" and ways to interact that feel and look natural. Players wouldn't necessarily need to be on ODTs but it would be neat to take advantage of the Razer Hydra in the way that The Gallery does but much more refined. Crouching would crouch and laying down would make the player go prone; using the sticks on the hydras would move the player forward and backward (or whatever control scheme was most conducive to the kind of realistic sense of presence I'm talking about). 

- AI has always been spotty in games, but in dialogue the tacit rules of human interaction should emulate what you'd expect in real life. If a player starts running around the room knocking stuff over while the NPC is trying to have a conversation, the NPC could scold the player verbally and say something like: ""when you're done fucking around, come over here and talk to me. We don't have much time."" To advance the dialogue, the player should look at the NPC (to simulate eye contact) or what the NPC is instructing the player to look at. These cues would move the conversation forward. If two players were playing in Co-op, the same rules would apply and NPCs would react to both players not engaging in the appropriate cues.  

- In the vein of Mass Effect and dialogue choices, sentences could come up suspended in space between the player and the NPC that the player could select by reading them aloud on the microphone. For people who want a greater degree of immersion, players could role play and emote their lines like an actor and this process could even be picked up in software and reacted to appropriately by the NPC. For example: ""let me hear your war cry!"" Player: ""ahh."" NPC: ""no, like you've got a pair. AGAIN!"" Player: ""AHHHHHHHHH!"" NPC: ""That's the spirit!""  These kinds of things could be opted out of, naturally. In a co-op game, as someone brought up in another thread, proximity voice could be used that was affected by all the variables that would affect a human voice in real life, like the acoustic properties of a room or the amount of background noise. 

*It'd be neat to have a situation where one player made a distraction by talking to an NPC and engaging it in conversation while the other player snuck in and stole something. When the other player accidentally makes a sound (by bumping a coffee mug off the table or something), the NPC could turn around to investigate which is when the other player could keep engaging the NPC in conversation by reading prompts aloud.*

- Loading screens could get creative. Maybe the player could go to sleep, or simply be in a car going through a tunnel while the next level loaded. Anything would be better than HL2's method of simply freezing the game and making the player want to vomit. 

- Attention to detail could really pay off. If the player needs to find a way out of the abandoned city, they could walk up to scattered vehicles, inspect them for damage, rummage for keys, check the oil tank (and simulate siphoning gas with their mouth) etc. Imagine the player decides on an awesome Suzuki Hayabusa motorcycle. In order to drive it, the player needs to hold his hands/the hydra out and flick his wrist, approximating in mid air how to start the ignition and so on. It wouldn't need to be perfect; it could be based on custom movements at the start of the game (sitting down could be optional). Imagine sitting in a helicopter and moving your virtual hands around to flick all of the switches before take off, then grabbing a throttle (in midair with your hand like a Kinect sensor or just with a single Hydra or another peripheral already set up) then lifting off... 

- Lastly, imagine gaming evolving beyond the point where players just mow down thousands of enemies without breaking a sweat. Since the player actually feels like they're there, the suspension of disbelief could create real fear and tension, causing the player to behave as he/she really would in these situations. 

Anyway, just some ideas. It's been awhile since I made this kind of post on here. What does everyone else think? ",,False,self,t5_2uni5,1372427187.0,,,True,t3_1h8w9r,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1h8w9r/my_idea_for_a_kind_of_game_that_can_only_exist_in/,
1371355841.0,39,self.oculus,1gfrnd,I got my Rift! Holy snap! Here's what I think...,46,7,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1gfrnd/i_got_my_rift_holy_snap_heres_what_i_think/,"So I received a Rift. I say ""a Rift"" instead of ""my Rift"" because I simply couldn't wait any longer. I ordered mid January and still have not received a processing status change email. I bought one off eBay, and my plan is to sell this Rift when my Rift arrives. I may end up losing a bit of money, but I think it's worth it!

So I get the package, open it up, and I'm just all smiles, ear to ear, I can't wait to try this thing! The package was so light, surprisingly light, I'm not sure why but seeing all the pictures of the hard case and all the stuff it comes with I was expecting it to be heavier. The Rift itself is extremely light and fit comfortably on my head.

Setup is plug and play. Hook up the video, USB and power, windows recognized and installed the tracker automatically and the device shows up as a second monitor labelled ""Rift DK"".

First game I loaded up was the Tuscany demo. So I put it on, I chose to stand up because in the game you're standing, and I start looking around. Holy sheep shit all the hype is real! You feel like you're standing inside this house. The sense of scale is there, you look up, and ceiling looks like its about 20ft high, and looking at the hanging chandelier is when I noticed the 3D effect, very cool. The room size and everything just looks great. Then I put my hands up in front of my face and it really does feel like you're invisible! It's incredible, just wonderful, I had an ear to ear smile the whole time. Walking outside the house to the fountain, then turning around and looking at the house was another ""wow"" for me, I don't know why but it was like ""holy shit there is the house I just came from! So coooool"". It's really exciting to experience for the first time, the simplest things in VR are awing. 

After a while of walking and looking around, I know I'm standing in front of my computer, but it starts to feel like I'm in control of a robot or being that is actually inside this house, and I can move and look around, but I can't actually feel or touch anything.

Next big game I tried was Half-Life 2. This was also very exciting, the train ride and looking at the NPC's, and when you get off the train the scale of the area really hits you. The experience while playing this game in the Rift, to playing on a monitor is apples to oranges. I play standing up, with an Xbox controller, with aim mode 1 (so you aim with your head) and it is just wonderful. It's really easy to target enemies looking at them, and you just type 'exec 360controller' to get it to work, and the pitch control on the right stick is disabled by default, so It doesn't interfere with the head tracking, it is a true immersive experience. I'm currently playing through the game and loving it!

I tried a slew of other demos but HL2 is what does it for me, such a cool game!

So onto the opportunities for improvement. Number one of course is the resolution and the screen door effect (RSDE) for me these go hand in hand. The RSDE really does suck. It sucks bad. Having tried the Rift I now understand why this could be a deal breaker for some people. However for me the precise head tracking and sense of immersion make up for it, and I can look past the RSDE and I still have a very good experience in the Rift. And of course we know that this will improve. If you're the type of gamer that favours graphics over game play, the Rift may not be for you!

The motion blur while moving your head was a non issue for me. It is there, but honestly I don't even notice it while playing. I'm running a decent rig with an i7 and a 680gtx 4gig, so I get very good frame rates, I've read this helps with the motion blur. But again I don't notice it at all.

Motion sickness is a non issue for me, I guess I'm one of the lucky ones!

What is a concern for me though is that long sessions in the Rift grow uncomfortable because I get hot wearing the device and start to sweat, and the lenses fog up. I have oily skin as well, so the foam starts to irritate my forehead. Now I've read that this issue is due to having the Rift straps adjusted too tight, and you should loosen it. Aware of this I certainly tried, and I've adjust the straps as loose as they will go, and have the upper strap adjusted perfectly so that the rift sits comfortably on my head, but its not pressed into my face. So I'm not sure here, maybe I just have a big head? At any rate I'd be happy to see a different, less absorbent material used as cushioning in the retail version than foam (which would also be more sanitary) that is easy to wipe clean.

Overall the Rift is definitely a ""wow"" experience like no other, and this is how I want to play my games! It's current flaws can be overcome and when the consumer version drops, even if it doesn't have positional tracking I don't think they'll be able to make enough of them to keep up with demand and it will be like trying to get a Wii the first year it launched.

NowI worry that immersion within a surreal environment filled with 'impossible' architecture and disorienting layer effects will prove uncomfortable",47,10,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1coswk/last_night_i_caved_and_ordered_a_dev_kit_after/,"Thanks for reading further! Hopefully some of you with rift experience can assuage my concerns. 

So, primarily I am concerned with one of the core tenets of 'gameplay' in this (quite incomplete) project, and how people will react to it in the rift. One of the concerns people seem to keep having revolves around the disorienting sensation of when player location, orientation or control are taken away for say, a cutscene or a level change. If you've played the original LSD you know that player location within the game world is constantly shifting- any time you interact with an object or walk into part of the level geometry, you are teleported to a different, equally surreal environment. In addition to this, my game also shifts gravity, the player's size, shape and field of view. I'm sure that the shifting FOV effects will cause some issues, so I'm working on removing or retooling them already. Will these other features also prove too disorienting, should I remove them as well or is there some way I should I attempt to retool the gameplay?  

Also, I've noticed a lot of complaints regarding the nature of HUDs or menu information in the rift- UI elements that feel sort of stuck to your face- people claim, for example, that the health bar in TF2 sort of 'floats' in front of you on a separate level from the world around you, which they say is disorienting and uncomfortable. I was recently playing around with fixed 3d Layers and shaders, that remain in ""HUD"" perspective with the player,  to create a strange sort of 'depth of field' effect, that actually serves to remove/confuse the players' sense of depth and scale. While this works on a 2d moniter, it may no longer work with the oculus rift for obvious reasons, but again, having never put one on I have no idea how this could be changed or improved. 

That's pretty much it, really. Thanks for reading this! I really appreciate your advice, if there's any to be offered. ",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1coswk,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1coswk/last_night_i_caved_and_ordered_a_dev_kit_after/,

Beta builds for backers will be available at/around the end of the Kickstarter, since we can't see folks' contact info before then (unless you just want to PM me with proof you backed!).

As of May, this will include the spectacular multiplayer mode Multirush, which we couldn't be more excited about.

The Rift Rush project started two months ago when we were fortunate enough to be part of the Oculus Partner Preview, so the controls/Rift integration are complete and crisp.  Help us hire an artist and finish developing the game!

This may have been discussed before, so forgive me if I missed that link. 

I just got my rift 2 days ago. After the initial foray of demos the first day (Greebles, Titans, Ocean Rift) I was incredibly impressed. I began feeling sick after attempting Qbeh, and realizing that positional tracking is obviously very important. (I found that if you tell your mind to move in the direction you want to go and then turn the mouse in said direction, you can completely eliminate the psoitional tracking problem). These demos were awesome, but I didn't exactly remember them as crazy experiences. 

On day 2 though, I played HL2... for 3 hours. It was insane how immersive it was. Then today I realized I remember practically everything that happened. Each individual scene was like a part of my life I have lived. I felt happy today and kind of euphoric, like I had just gone somewhere and experienced something.. similar to if I went there in real life. 

Obviously my dreams were crazier that night as well. 

Do you think the rift memories are stored in the same memory bank as our daily experience memories, or do you think it's opening up a different part of our brain? 

This question may be out there, but I'm just curious what others have experienced! 

On a side note, I love the rift... despite the resolution and FOV limitations, it is the most impressive thing I have ever seen. ",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1jnehv,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1jnehv/the_rift_memory_and_how_the_brain_interprets/,

Even more so do we now have to be critical of this new technology and to make sure that the people we expose it to and the projects (new games developing for this) don't backfire on us and turn this into a failed step towards immersion for everyone.

I have a segment in the beginning of the video explaining in detail how the 3D looks in Vireio, and my best explanation as to why. It is slightly different in each game, and there is the chance that I have missed something in the setting procedure that will change the experience. Have expertise or advice? Lay it on me. XD [/disclaimer]  
  
Even with the depth issues, it is still a 3D game and the effect of parallax makes the 3D rather convincing. I had a FANTASTIC time playing Portal 2 in Vireio (in case you couldn't tell in my previous vid)! I commend Andres (CyberReality) and the many others that have contributed to Vireio to make this VR retro-fitting possible!  
  
Dirt 2 is an example of me taking one for the team. It was rough! XD I really hope a racing game gets proper Rift integration soon. It seems like it would be a great experience!

Whenever people first try a brand new technology, the novelty of the tech, itself, is enough. Soon, the novelty wears off and people want more sophisticated implementations. It's similar to any major jump in graphical quality. A new game with vastly better graphics than its competitors will seem awesome just because it's pretty, but soon that's not so compelling and the game needs to stand up on its own. see oblivion. This is more pronounced at the start of a console generation, for obvious reasons.

The rift presents something different from the normal graphical jump, but there are parallels. Perhaps if it was a true holodeck type deal (ie virtual reality in the most extreme sense of the words), where every sense is exploited flawlessly... But that is far off, and right now we're just talking about wearing a rift at your desk/couch.

Anyways, hope somebody enjoys reading it!**
*************************

So, finally, after months and months of waiting, I received my Oculus Rift Dev Kit last night.  And wow, it's pretty much everything I'd hoped it would be, and honestly more, because one can't really just READ about what makes this thing so amazing..  It's one of those things that you have to experience yourself.  I will say this.. if you have a reasonably fast computer that can handle modern games fairly well, and 300 bucks that you don't mind spending, the Dev Kit is incredible.  I highly recommend getting one prior to the Consumer version that is probably a year or so away if this is something you're interested in. You will not regret the 300 bucks.

**************************


I thought I would start out with mentioning the **CONS** after day 1 of using the device, and honestly, these cons are things that are probably all going to be addressed in the consumer version, so they are primarily issues related to the early Dev Kit. 


The absolute BIGGEST issue that I (and everyone else!) have with the Dev Kit is the low resolution.  1280x800 is effectively 640x800 per eye, so the pixelation is pretty massive inside the rift.  There are various things that can be done.. anti aliasing makes a huge difference, as does having the rift downsample (basically, more nice looking anti aliasing) by running the program at 1920x1080.  This helps tremendously, but also noticably affects framerates on a lot of programs, even on my fairly fast machine (GTX 680).  People mention the screen-door effect, where you can see the individual pixels and the space between them, but this honestly did not bother me.  It was extremely easy to ignore because your surroundings are SO immersive and interesting.  The resolution, primarily when looking to the distance, is extremely noticable as the pixels are just so big.   Can't wait for the consumer version to address this.


The other ""Con"" I have is that the framerate is exceptionally important.  If you aren't running at 60+ FPS, it really begins to take a toll on your stomach.  The jutter and unsmooth movement really kind of makes one feel a little bit ill, so it is very important to run things at settings that allow your computer to run at a high framerate.  This is going to be even more difficult to make sure you are achieving 60+ fps when you run things at 1080p in the consumer version.  That said, it's so so worth it :)


***************************

**Half Life 2:** So what's it like being in the rift?  I think the easiest way to describe it would be trying to explain the best and most impressive thing I tried thus far, which is a 10+ year old game.  Simply put, it's rather incredible.  The first thing one notices is the fact that it literally does feel like you are standing there, as Gordon Freeman, in the train at the beginning of the game.  It does not feel like you're looking at a video game, it feels like you are there, looking through someone's eyes.  You walk up to the first man sitting in the train, and DUCK, it feels like you are crouching there, at his knees, looking up at the guy.  The primary thing happening that makes the rift SO incredible is the completely legitimate sense of SCALE, something you cannot really achieve on a 2d monitor.  You walk into the gymnasium,  and look up... you actually feel as if you are standing in the middle of this huge structure, that the ceiling is REALLY a hundred feet up.  You look at the doctor's desk full of comptuers, items, papers.. and it REALLY looks like those items are in front of you, sitting on a desk.  It's unbelievable.   The sense of scale is the most legitimate way I can describe how it is so much different from experiencing a game in any 2d fashion.


There was also a point when in a doctors lab.. I crawled up into a corner on some boxes.  I actually felt this sense of claustrophobia, like the ceiling was touching my head.  It again, was that sense of scale.  Another incredible effect I had was during a firefight, a bunch of dudes were shooting at me, and hitting a piece of rock that I was ducking behind.  I actually FELT a pebble of debris strike my head.  It was completely unexpected but also completely noticable.  Pretty fascinating what my brain did there :)


2 more interesting experiences in HL2 to mention...  in the doctors lab, his headcrab pet jumping around is terrifying.  The headcrab is on a set of lockers, and jumps over your head onto a bunch of boxes and into a vent.  This feels as if it is really happening. The sensation of having that headcrab above you, jumping around, was incredibly weird. 


The final OMG moment was when I (Gordon Freeman) got my suit.  As I put it on, my hand extends and flexes, as if I was reseating my glove.  That was unexpected and felt rather incredible.. my brain initially told me that it was my hand, and it really felt like it was in a way.  VERY hard to describe.  In any case, Half Life 2 is absolutely incredible in the rift.

*****************************

**Greebles:**  This was the very first demo I loaded up.  The program is an on rails demo where all you can do is look around.   It's quite interesting and beautiful, and was a great first experience.  Again, the sense of scale is in effect here..  as you are floating, there is a point where the ground is seemingly hundreds of feet beneath you, and if you look up, you see towering structures that really look like they're hundreds of feet in the air.  The effect of everything pulsating to the music when you are floating around is profound.  It legitimately feels as if you are floating!

****************************

**Titans of Space** was the second demo, and again the sense of scale was profoundly impressive.  You are floating around on a guided tour.  You look in front of you and there's jupiter, looking mighty huge.  But you look behind you, and the SUN is the most massive thing you have ever seen, dwarfing the biggest planet that's right in front of you.  It's uncanny how incredibly huge the sun feels.   Not only that, but you are actually sitting in a cockpit, with a body.  Looking down at your body, sitting there as you sit there, is an incredibly odd experience. 


Something that was pretty cool was the fact that I had a buddy using the rift in Titans of Space after I had initally tried it.  As I was watching my cloned screen, it was shocking to see just how unimpressive titans of space looked on a 2d screen.  The sun looked huge, yes, but it really was just a big circle on a screen.  It  was completely uninteresting, compared to the contrast of seeing it in the rift.  That's really when the sense of scale thing clicked for me.

***************************

**RiftCoaster:**  The Rift Coaster was way more cool than I expected it to be, for some reason.  The sheer distance involved in the world was REALLY neat, and while I didn't really get a stomach drop feeling from the coaster itself, I was still pretty blown away by what I was experiencing.  It again, felt real, and the sense of scale was 100% there.  Very very cool.   At one point when I was using it, my buddy started blowing air in my face during the drop off...  it actually was a NEAT effect and I think it would be cool to have a fan nearby to point to someones face when they're going down the drop :)

**************************
**Tuscany:**  This was actually way better than I expected for some reason.  The particles floating through the air were incredibly cool, and its REALLY nice to just walk around the environment.  My favorite effect was near the fireplace, the right closest window has some sunflowers growing outside, and the sense that these were right there was just fascinating to me.  This is definitely the first thing I'm going to show people, along with the riftcoaster (especially non-rifters).  I guess there's a reason why these seem to be universally shown first to others.

**************************
**Delta Draconis:**  I absolutely loved this demo.  The sense of flying around this environment in 360 degrees was incredible, and it was very actually cool that it was so disorienting when you could not see the ground.  Once you had some perspective, it felt great.  The lighting in the distance, the little rocket thing, and flying around close to the ground was particularily mesmirizing.  It reminded me of flying around the trenches of the death star in the classic star wars moment.  It actually felt real.

***************************

So.. my first day with the rift was pretty incredible!  I have a few other things to mention that I noticed:

**Motion Sickness:** I am lucky in that I was able to stave off motion sickness.  All together I probably spent a good 3 or 4 hours in the rift total, and while I did have really strange perceptions after the fact, and my stomach did not feel quite right,  I did not get really Ill.   However, a friend of mine had a massive issue when we were running Delta Draconis at 1920x1080, because FAST head movements were slightly slowed or laggy for some reason, hence his difficulty.  It was immediate, he took it off and was out of commission for awhile.  I think it is important to maybe mention to people not to jerk their head around really fast, but to move more slowly and scan, because SUPER FAST head moments do seem to have an ever so perceptible delay or issue.  Maybe it was just due to the framerate.


**Framerate:**As I mentioned above, I started to feel my stomach not agreeing with me in anything that had a framerate that was not 60 fps.  This happened primarily during the 3d fractal demo (that I didnt find too great, probably due to the framerate, which is why I didnt really write anything about it).  


**After Effects:** After spending an hour or so playing Half Life 2, when I stepped out of the rift, my perception of reality was a little weird and ""off"".  It didn't do anything functionally bad for me, but doing things in first person particularily was very strange.  Something like raising my cellphone up and looking at it ACTUALLY somehow felt like I was still in the rift.  It was a very very strange effect that I've heard other people mention.. but it was interesting none-the-less.


**Inside the Rift:** The best part of being in the rift, especially with headphones on, is exactly what the point of the thing is.  You really feel like you're there, and actual reality is not.  It's hard to even remember that you are sitting in a chair at a computer in real life, because your brain just doesn't go there.  I definitely experienced the whole ""jarring"" transition back to real reality.. and it was honestly kind of neat.  I realize there are scary implications of this type of thing, but honestly, if people DO get addicted to VR worlds, it means that the technology is REALLY awesome :D


**Brain Fatigue:**  Last of all, after a full day of dealing with the rift (along with breaks to watch tv and do other things), I felt pretty drained by the end of the day.  It literally felt like my brain had worked hard on a project all day, and I didn't have anything left in me (which, it really was working hard on a project all day!).  It felt like my brain was having all sorts of new experiences that it was trying to create neural pathways to deal with, even if it didn't really feel stressful or taxing DURING the experiences.  By the end of the day, I was beat, and actually went to bed earlier than I normally do (something that rarely happens).  It felt like I was learning something... and that was actually something pretty cool that I did not expect.  I woke up today feeling great and with little issue, so all is well!

*******************

All in all, despite the cons and limitations of the dev kit...  this shit is fully the real deal.  There's no real way to accurately describe how interesting it is.. but I do think that the repeated word I used a lot in these thoughts is the word SCALE.  Being able to experience a world that really feels like there is a roof above your head, or that you're in a closed, cramped ventilation shaft, is unbelievable.  It's that holy grail of virtual environments that I've dreamed of since I was a little kid, and I'm completely excited to finally be on the ground floor, experiencing this at it's infancy.  After wearing the rift,  I do not see how this could end up being another gimmick.  The potential is just too great, and the experiences that one can already experience are mindblowingly cool.  Once the hardware gets better, and once the experiences start REALLY being created with the rift in mind, the possibilities are truly going to be endless.  The future is going to be a lot more interesting because of this, I believe!",,False,self,t5_2uni5,1375483984.0,,,True,t3_1jl8ux,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1jl8ux/my_super_long_day_1_rift_impressions_writeup/,

1373072760.0,29,self.oculus,1hq2ub,Rift Has Arrived! I had some awesome first day reactions.,40,11,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1hq2ub/rift_has_arrived_i_had_some_awesome_first_day/,"It's been a long wait but I finally got the Rift on Friday. The customs issue combined with worry that I used an FPO-AP address (military base in Japan) are now a memory. I've been following the development since the Kickstarter and I'm an early open purchaser, so I knew roughly how I wanted to proceed.

First, I did the unboxing with obligatory photos for Facebook. The connection was easy enough and I used the DVI output of my card. Plus I read the enclosed documention in case there was something I missed. Not having to buy cables was great and the carrying case is perfect for some demos I want to do on my base.

**My system is not high end**: Pentium Duel Core E5500 (ok, a store bought Dell) and an ASUS EAH5670 graphics card, and my normal monitor is a 24"" 1080p display. However, I think this helped my initial impressions of the Rift which I'll mention later. The HDMI went to my monitor while the DVI went to the Rift.

**Display**: Long story short I went with duplicated display at 1080p. Extended display just annoyed me as the demos might play on main monitor or my desktop set-up got mixed up with changing primaries. Some demos such as the cool Deskope desktop emulator requires. Even my older system seem to handle things fine, plus the Rift down sampling the visuals made for better quality visuals. Again, if you set the Rift display at 1080p, some demos might not recognize it.

**Wearing the Rift**: My eyesight is split 20/20 left and 20/70 right so I left in the A cups for now and didn't use glasses. A large nose meant a visible gap at the bottom so I can see the real world in VR. That also means I moved the lenses all the way forward. Still, I appear to get a 100 to 110 FOV. I also had to have the straps all the way out and it still feels a bit tight. No big deal.

Using the new SDK for IPD measurement was easy though it's weird that I can see the lines looking forward but not looking straight at them (you have to look at the line to calibrate). That brought my first VR to be that holodeck looking room with the mannequin, car, chair and wall. This utility is also good to make sure your system is recognizing the Rift's movement input which might shut off due to some demos or system quirks.

**Cables**: You quickly build up a system of putting on and putting off the Rift with headphones and controller. The Hydra, cool as it is when it doesn't drift, gets cables tangled all the time. Till I settle down, I sticking with the XBox controller (and will get the wireless hydra).

**Motion Sickness**: Didn't really get sick. Before doing anything I set the lenses then my IPD as others warned. I been using the My3D viewer which got me in a poor man's VR mindset. I have a fan in my room directed on me which helped. I stood up most of the time when the game simulated that and sat down for cinema and cockpit demos. I drank a lot of water. On top of that, I've spent years on ships and have done helo rides so that might have helped.

**Demos**: I tried many demos. Most were ok. The Hydra demos did not do it for me. Partly was an issue with re-calibrating (each game might have a different method). Plus I think its best to have hands holding the controllers in game with a different scheme to interact with objects. Here's some others that left an impression.

**Titans of Space**: The go to Demo if you have 10 minutes to show a person. Unfortunately, I already saw this normally so there were no suprises in scale (until the big guys show up). What really got me was seeing the avatar. Instead of standing up, I sat down, put the controller away and put my hands in my lap mimicking the avatar. It really felt like I was looking down at my body in a space suit (Demo idea: recreate the chest burster scene from Aliens). Also, don't forget to zoom and look around while doing it.

**UDK Demos**: Even before getting the Rift these annoyed me by their file size and seemingly random install locations. Apparently there are non-intuitive config settings to optimize to the Rift you should do with each demo (such as changing resolution to 1080p, setting eyeheight, etc). Plus, as I already played them there were few surprises and I even did the Roller Coaster standing up with no problem. My one take away was the cool feeling of going up to a wall or handrail and feeling like it was in front of me.

**Alone in the Rift**: Noped the fuck out of there. Is there a rapid calibration for this by the way for the hydra controllers?

**First Law**: The interior cockpit view was the best takeaway. Really needs an avatar to sell it.

**Ocean Rift**: Another go to demo. The shark surprise might be too much for a first time watcher. However, the rest was great, especially the part you're under that school of fish and you feel them above you.

**Deskope** (Emulate your desktop on the RIft): Needs polishing but it was amazing. I switched to extended 1080p. My system was taking so hits but all in all it's a workable desktop. Watched a StarCraft broadcast and loved how it felt like I was watching a 60"" big screen.

**VR Cinema**: Might be cool, but setting up movies that aren't AVI was too much of a hassle this early.

**VR Player**: YES!!!! This was cool. Once you figured out the settings it needed for the Rift (Plane, ratio, FOV, etc) it worked great. I watched some Side by Side IMAX 3d videos and got lost in it. Still needs polishing but great. One take away is I closed each eye and gauged the size of the screen. This helped with immersion. Oh yeah, and press F1 a lot. I did notice it didn't work with the Avatar 3d YouTube URL.

**Dear Esther**: I could not get this to work with Vireo at all. Admin mode, direct open, Steam open, nada. Most I got was side by side with no distortion. Head tracking did not work at all. I really wanted this game to work as it would be a great demo to non-gamers. Hopefully the new program getting developed or Valve's source code allowing VR will make this work.

**Half Life 2**: A little issue getting it started as the game defaulted to DX9. Once it started though I had one question: How the fuck is a seven year old game the best demonstration of VR right now? My gods, I was though it was ok till I saw the chinese take-out box blow in the breeze and then I was blown away as it felt real. Then I stood up. Now that is the way to play this game. I'm in the interogation room, looking at the doctor on the monitor then I look down at the console in front of me. It's big and it's solid. Then I look to my left. Geez Barney is as tall as I am, has substance and he's looking at me. When people said you get a sense of personal space in this game, they're not joking. 

I'm not an FPS type of player, but I'd love to walk through this game with no fighting (and minimal fast climbing) just to experience more of that feeling. The only thing I miss is not having an avatar. I cannot wait to see what Valve does with a game they design from the ground up with VR. My one fault was not playing TF2 and getting all the settings from that to use on HL2. I'll do that today and see if an already awesome experience improves.

**Closing Thoughts**: I think what helped with the initial impression for me is that I'm not a gamer. As such, I've never been after the most modern computer to really get the most out of games. Yeah, I could see a screen door and line breaks. However, I didn't care about that because I'm not used to it in my 2d games. To me, the Rift was as John Carmack said last year ""One of the best VR devices on the planet outside of some basement in NASA or something"". Now, it's not true anymore as Oculus and others are making better VR displays. However, I haven't seen better so right now this is the best for me and it's amazing. I actually do recommend buying one of these 800p Rifts for the few months of fun you will get.

For games, having a body to look at worked best for me. If there's a way to emulate how you're controlling the game (hands on keyboard and mouse, holding a game pad, hands in lap, ete) then that works better. Even the Hydra I think would be better if its the controllers you see in game with a beam or something that grabs instead of bare heads. Also, collision detection is much more important as it's jarring to have objects or another person's head move through your own.

**PS**: Thanks to the guy that is developing the http://everythingoculus.co.uk website. With all these demos and set-up quirks, that site is just going to make the lives of the coming group of Rifters much easier early on. Going to use it for my TF2 and HL2 playing today.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1hq2ub,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1hq2ub/rift_has_arrived_i_had_some_awesome_first_day/,

Write up inside,37,5,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1fo9l9/i_recently_got_to_try_out_vrcade_in_seattle_write/,"It was AMAZING! We got to go to their lab about 10 minutes north of Seattle and try out the demos they currently have set up. The first demo was kind of like an arcade 'shoot the targets' sort of game that was a blast. They have their own head mounted display instead of using the rift which has much higher pixel density and sharper area of focus in the center than the dev kit. They use surrounding cameras to track where you are looking and moving about the room. I was surprised to hear this is how they track head movement but it really was almost no delay when looking around still. They had a gun that was fully tracked by the cameras as well so you could rotate it around in your hands. It felt so real!

The first thing I noticed when jumping into it was the sense of depth. You start in the center of an intersection of 4 tunnels and the tunnels really looked like they just appeared in the walls of the room I was standing before I put on the display. I couldn't believe how good the 3d was. You are presented with a drop down that says something like ""VRcade, shoot to start"" which moves away when you shoot it and the targets start to pop up. It was incredibly intuitive to just lift the gun and shoot at the targets. There was absolutely 0 learning curve. We had some non gamer friends with us as well that can attest to this. It makes perfect sense if you think about it. At the end of the demo, you could lean down to the ground to look at a score board. It really felt like the scoreboard was right there in front of you.

The second demo was in the same room as the first but this time there were some boxes with varying levels of physics lying around you could play with. It was a blast pushing around the boxes with the gun. Some had no gravity so you could push them and watch them float around the room.

The third demo was a zombie simulation where you stand in the middle of a post apocalyptic looking parking lot and watch as zombies surround you. You can't do anything to fight back so it was an eerie feeling as they surround you, especially when the first on gets to you. They would follow you as you walked around the room as well which was creepy.

Overall, this was a fantastic experience. We got to learn all about their vision for the VRcade once it gets to market and see some other demos they were working on for the future. I want to thank Jamie and Mark for letting us come out and test their stuff! If anyone else is in the area and are interested in testing, Jamie told me you can email him at jamie@vrcade.com and they would be happy to do that.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,1370377367.0,,,True,t3_1fo9l9,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1fo9l9/i_recently_got_to_try_out_vrcade_in_seattle_write/,

*Enables you to SEE your body and legs in first person*

      cl_first_person_uses_world_model 1


*Taunts remain in first person*

     tf_taunt_first_person 1

**Sixense (razer hdyra commands), make sure to DISABLE, turn OFF sixense motion creator suite**

*Fixed filtering! When zoomed in, the crosshair still shakes for me, hard to snipe.*

     sixense_set_filter_params 800 .93 1200 .98

*adds disable hydra as mouse in tf2 menus, now you can disable the hydra in the menu, WHENEVER! just press J, or any desired key before entering a game menu, and u can use your regular mouse*

         bindtoggle j ""sixense_mouse_enabled""



*completely disengages the crosshair from the middle, whereas sixense_mode 1 has the cursor kinda stuck to the middle*

      sixense_mode 0

*It varies between 0,1,2 low,medium,high beginners might want to try 0, but once you get used to it, 2 is fine*

    sixense_sensitivity_level 2

*The golden command for rifters, increasing this value will increase the size from the middle when the free crosshair starts moving the screen,*  **so you can look one way and shoot another**  *please play with this value as I don't have a rift to test it, the higher the value the more you have to move the controller to make it change the camera, if set really high, you'll have to move the controller 'off the field of vision' to actually move camera*

     sixense_aim_freeaim_dead_zone_radius 20

Other aspects of the cone of radius may be adjusted as well (the speed of speed, acceleration, etc please see guide link for details



*edit/update1: added a few commands*
*edit/update 2:* FOUND A FIX FOR FILTERING!!! No more Michael J Foxing!


**Please let me know how it works out for you, I'm anxious to try this!!!**

I jumped in the kickstarter with the sole intention of hacking the rift. Well, I really just wanted one and this allowed me to justify the expense. 

Hacks planned so far:

- ambilight mod (adding LEDs to the far outside edges of the inside of the unit that change to match the edge of screen color). I'm hoping this will be a nice addition to your peripheral vision, but it may prove to just be annoying... we'll see!

- super simple hawken cockpit build. I want a quasi standing position with arm-rests and a 5 point harness, maybe even a bass vibration system. Not sure if I'll build a custom control system or not, might just use the hydra. This will be fairly low budget and hacked together, most likely from a cheap engine stand.

**Since it is my job to continuously do stuff like this, (yeah, best job in the universe), I would like some more ideas. Let me have them!**

Ideas that I think are probably too complex for me to tackle at this point, even though I'd love to (I usually only have about a week per project).

Abrash's talk was titled ""Why virtual reality is hard (and where it might be going)"".
He focused on a lot of the technical issues associated with how modern displays function and the implications.  You can see some of that content here:  http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/abrash/.  He had a list of potential problems and only focused on the one; it was 25 minutes long and if it was a minute longer my brain would have melted.  He'll post the slides soon i'm sure.

Ludwig focused on the practical challenges of retrofitting an exiting game to work with this hardware.  His talk was titled ""What we learned porting TF2 to Virtual Reality.""  Some of it you've read about and some of it is new.  He talked a lot about the different control schemes that they tried and why they went with the one they went with.  He talked about how he handled the presence of UI in games - he seemed to indicate that minimal or no UI is ideal.

I wish I had taken better notes for you guys, but I didn't.  The one thing that I wanted to relate to all of you is that for the first time, this feels like a crystallized, real thing now.  These talks made it feel like that even more so than using the hardware.  VR is no longer the domain of science fiction.

I signed up for the kit specifically in hopes to use it in combination with the Rift.

Unfortunately, after playing with the unit for a few days I have significant doubts about its use with the rift for hand tracking.

1. **Range** - The range of the developer unit is a little over 1 foot. If you wanted to mount the leap to the headset, it wouldn't be able to see your hands outstretched. Might be improved in the commercial version.

2. **Line of Sight** - The leap can only see whats in its line of sight. Complex hand movements, for instance, typing on a keyboard, occlude subtle finger movements that the leap will not be able to detect. It's hard to realize how much of an issue this is until you see the leap visualizer trying to figure out where your fingers are behind your palm.

3. **SDK** - The current SDK is very limited. It allows for finger and tool detection, and can find the palm of your hand... if you have the unit on a flat surface, and your hand is put out over the unit. The SDK only tracks hands well if they are palm towards the unit. If you for instance, make an ""Okay"" sign the finger data for your index and thumb disappear. There is no way to access the raw point cloud data.

Conclusion: While the SDK and Range may improve, nothing is going to fix the line of sight issue. Large hand gestures, or clumsy manipulations might work, but intricate and subtle finger movements are unlikely to work well.

For VR to take us to the next level, beyond an immersive upgrade for our current games, we really need to get our hands in there and be able to move and manipulate objects the way we do in the real world. And we need a universal solution thats able to be as wide spread as the mouse and keyboard is today. Still looking for a solution.

This ""review"" highlights both, leading to a very misconstrued view of what the Oculus is for the first-timers who wanted to know what all the hype is about. 
1. The reviewers are forgetting they are reviewing a development kit, meant for developers, stating flaws to potential consumers of the product. (Scott points out the screen resolution is low &amp; the blurry motion effect in a few choice demos while turning one's head left and right). These observations are true, but the actual consumer version of the rift will do away with most gripes.
2. OculusVR advises the users to try to condition their senses to the altering experience of virtual reality little by little. They actually provide a set of directions to follow so one can get accustomed to his/her rift. The reviewers who give knock off points for their inability to go through the process of doing this are not providing a proper review of how the consumer version SHOULD be used, and again, forget to mention this is a dev kit, where no rules are given to the devs who make the demos to insure they ease the player into it. This makes me sick. (Scott admits to only having the rift for a little while, but persists on jumping from Tuscany to Mirror's edge, to Riftcoaster one after another. He also admits he's been trying at least one demo for over an hour).

What you need: 

[Latest Vireio Perception driver](http://vire.io/download/Perception_D3D_proxy.zip)

Open Track - [With Hydra](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15205095/opentrack_hydra.zip) | [Without Hydra](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15205095/opentrack.zip)

(Note: I haven't tested it with the Hydra for positional tracking yet, but should work in theory)

Ok, before doing anything, make sure you've got DayZ all up to date and installed and run it so you can change some options. I downloaded the ""Play With Six"" installer from [dayzmod.com](http://dayzmod.com) if you want to follow exactly what I did. 

1.) In DayZ, go to options &gt; video &gt; and set your resolution to 1280 x 800 and full screen. Also adjust any graphics settings you may want to change for running in the rift such as lowering details, shadows etc. 

2.) After saving graphic options go to options &gt; controls &gt; controller and select OpenTrack and click enable, the save settings, and close the game. (I found the the head bob was a bit much when in the Rift so I turned that way down, and you may want to also before closing out.)

3.) Navigate to My Documents &gt; ArmA 2 and find the file called yourusername.ArmA2Profile and open this in a txt editor. Scroll all the way to the bottom and you'll find to options for fovtop and fovleft. Change to the following to get an FOV of 90.


fovTop=1.0297443;

fovLeft=1.8306564;


With this I can slightly see the top and bottom bars of the screen while playing, so you may want to experiment a bit. [There is a guide to calculating these values for your desired FOV here](http://dayzmod.com/forum/index.php?/topic/31609-ultimate-fov-field-of-view-guide-for-arma-2-and-dayz-from-dayzpvpcom/).

You'll notice right under here there is some UI options. I haven't played with this but if someone is daring I bet we could get the UI working better in game as well.

4.) Navigate to the Vireio Perception folder where you extracted it to and find the folder perception\bin. Copy the .dll files in this folder to My Documents\ ArmA 2\expansion\beta

5.) Open up Vireio Perception and select Oculus Rift for the top option and No Tracking for the bottom option. The tracking with be handled by Open Track. 

6.) Launch Open Track which we downloaded earlier. Make sure under tracker source 1st it says ""Rift"", make sure your Rift is facing directly forward and then hit the ""Start"" button.

7.) Open up Play With Six, find a DayZ server and click join.

8.) Run like a mofo from zombies while looking over your shoulder at the approaching hoard and enjoy. :D

Ok hopefully I didn't forget anything, that should get you up and running. As I mentioned in my impressions thread, you wont be able to click on any of the menu options as the mouse cursor doesn't seem to register on the menus when in stereo. You can get around this by using tab/arrow keys/enter if you need to. 

If anyone finds any ways to improve the experience, gets hydra working, etc, let me know! Enjoy!",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1hh8jk,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1hh8jk/guide_to_setting_up_dayz_on_the_rift/,

Those games were a huge part of my childhood and I still love to play them today. I cannot get the thought of experiencing Myst 3/4 on the Rift out of my head. (I specifically mention 3 and 4 because they have the 360 real time panning.) Anyone else think this would be amazing? Using you head to look around the beautiful art of those games? If you've never played the Myst series, you probably aren't that excited by this idea. The world of Myst is incredibly magical and a beautifully crafted puzzle game and the Rift would just add a whole other dimension to the world. Do you think there would be any possibility of a port? They came out with an iPhone version of Riven a few years ago, so porting to modern platforms isn't out of the question.

Or if that's not possible, do you think there's a market for VR puzzle games in the style of Myst? I would kill for a Myst inspired Rift title! And I mean truly Myst style - no real time movement. I'm talking old-school QuicktimeVR shit. I think there is something inherently beautiful to restricting your movement to rotation only. It forces you to take in the art instead of running past it. And with it's pre-rendered graphics, it also makes every sight you see a perfectly framed up shot of beautiful vistas. Again, put the Rift into consideration, with it's ridiculously accurate head tracking. It would be incredible.

But maybe that's just me. I've been dying for a new Myst game for years anyway, so maybe my nostalgia and love of the series is clouding my judgement of this idea. What do you guys think?",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1gi7ey,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1gi7ey/myst_on_the_rift/,

**UPDATE: MY SECOND JOURNEY**
For my first journey, check out the link: http://www.mtbs3d.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=140&amp;t=17228

So it has been over a month since my initial journey through the Rift, which means I was long over due to jack back in. I finally lined up another date with RMC, this time meeting at a Makerspace close by. I wanted to stream my whole experience via Twitch, but unfortunately they did not have WiFi set up yet. This is very sad, as my second journey was **AMAZING**.

With RMC as my operator, we hooked everything up to my laptop. I had pre-loaded a bunch of things I wanted to try, and I was anxious to see the Rift working on my own rig (I have the same laptop as Cymatic Bruce). It wasn't long before we were ready to go. In my initial impressions, I commented about how the FOV was like looking through binoculars. I talked about seeing the edges all around. Some of you replied that this was probably due to not adjusting the Rift for my specific eyes. With this knowledge, the FIRST thing I wanted to do was to try and see if I could improve the FOV.

RMC was one step ahead of me, though. He had already set the Rift all the way in, as close to my eyes as they could get. We booted up Blue Marble and the difference was almost night and day from what I remembered. My vertical FOV was almost full - to the point that I could comfortable look up and down without seeing any black border. My horizontal FOV was still a little restricted, but only slightly, and to the point where it was easily ignored. Doing this one thing alone made the Rift 10x better instantly. I couldn't believe the difference. So those of you saying I needed to calibrate it, you were right.

I had many demos I wanted to try, but I only got to Blue Marble, Bunny Stories, Half-Life 2, vrCinema3D, MinecRift, First Law, and Proton Pulse. I would have tried more, but Half-Life 2 **completely blew my mind to the point that I could not put it down!** But let's go in order...

**Blue Marble**

It's a quick demo where you are shot into space with some nice music playing. After jacking in, I noticed how better my FOV was. The UI that appeared occasionally on my helmet was pretty cool. I was released into space and then just kind of looked around. The things close to me were cool, but the stuff far away suffered a bit due to the resolution. My mind also hadn't quite ""accepted"" everything as reality yet, so I was nitpicking. It wasn't long before my helmet told me I was running out of oxygen. After that, everything went black, so I can only assume that this whole thing was one elaborate suicide. Ok, everything is working, great - we're moving on (I wanted to get to HL2)!

**Bunny Stories**

And now for something completely different. It's a cartoon world hand drawn by a 7 year old girl. Need I say more? Very cool. Very different. The standout of this demo is a butterfly that flies around. I tracked it with my head, simply amazed at how easy it was to follow it along. The rest of my time was spent trying to figure out what the other creatures were supposed to be. Ok, I think it's HL2 time already!

**HALF LIFE 2**

I spent at least 30 minutes straight playing HL2. These 30 minutes convinced me without a shadow of a doubt that this is the future of gaming.

It started with G Man's disfigured face taking up the screen. Grr, it's not working. He isn't rendering right. My operator tells me to just close my eyes until he goes away. I take his advice and open my eyes just in time for the train car to fade into focus. Whoa. Whoa! I'm in the train car! In Half Life 2! The NPCs are looking at me. People are talking but I don't even care. Wow. I also had headphones plugged in by this point. Audio also greatly improved my experience over last time.

Before I even exit the car, a flying bot comes by and photographs me, blinding me temporarily. ""Sonofa...where's my crowbar??"". I exit the car and look around, taking it all in. I was there. I couldn't believe it. It was so much better than I even remembered from my last time with the Rift. Resolution, screen door, whatever - didn't notice it for one second with HL2. I was like a kid in a candy store. I ran around to all the NPCs, feeling like I was interacting with them even though all I was doing was moving around. I came up to a girl on the other side of the chain link fence. She had her fingers through the holes and was just staring at me. I got up close. Is she going to let me kiss her? Ok, maybe I got too close. Then there were the stun batons..

So the guys with the batons were very threatening. I was very worried about pissing them off. I haven't played HL2 in years, so I couldn't remember exactly everything that happens. They surrounded me and took me to an interrogation room. It was all so real. I felt helpless, walking down the hallway, peering into other rooms, worried about where I was going. I was relieved when Barney revealed himself. ""Oh yeah! Barney!"". He helped me get past the checkpoint, but then I ran into another stun baton guy. I got up in his face and he pushed me back. Whoa! I guess I really pissed him off, because he started running towards me. Ahhh! I started running. I had no way to defend myself. I ran and ran. I could hear him right behind me. No more open doors. I'm cornered. I turn around just in time for WHACK WHACK. He hits me twice with the stun baton and mumbles something, then walks away. I can't believe I just freaked out that much over a stun baton!

I find my way out of the building, through the alleyway, and up through some buildings. As I'm climbing the stairs, the stun baton guys hone in on me. This next part was straight out of the Matrix. Everywhere I look, the stun baton guys are appearing! Up, up, through the attic and onto the roof. Oh yeah! Rooftop chase! I pump my arms like I'm sprinting and start running and jumping from rooftop to rooftop. Now people are shooting at me! Whoa, it's a long way down. What if I fall? I can't fall! I only have a bit of the ledge to get by on! I'm sliding down one roof onto another roof. I can hear them behind me! I find an open window and leap through it. Door or stairs? I glance at both before deciding the stairs. As I'm climbing down, they crumble. I hit the hallway and look for an exit. A stun dude bursts through one door. I quickly look at the other door to see another guy burst through. No exits! I run back to the stairs. No way up! They close in! Ahh! Stun baton to the face and it's all white! Then I hear her! Alex! ""Oh yeah, she saves me!"" This whole sequence was mind-blowing.

Interacting with Alex was a lot of fun. She chatted with me as we walked. I checked her out and wondered if she knew where I was looking. Then we met up with doc. Barney showed up. And we all had a natural conversation together (only with me not talking). It was so real. I was in the room with all of these characters. Doc even shoved me out of the way a time or two. On the monitor, I wouldn't think anything of it. In the Rift, I couldn't believe he'd just push me aside. The teleport sequence was VERY COOL. What will I be looking at next? I feel like I can reach out and touch everything. AH, monster! And I'm outside the window!

At this point I'm started to get a little of the motion sickness, but I want to get the crowbar. Finally Barney tosses it to me. Yes! Crowbar! So cool! I run around hitting boxes and walls! Awesome! But I do have to take a break! I make sure to save my game and then jack out for the first time in this journey.

**vrCinema3D**

RMC is kind enough to go grab us some ginger ale across the street (supposedly good for nausea). I take a bit of a breather (you can tell when you need to break as you'll start to sweat and find you need to focus on breathing). It isn't long before I'm ready to jump back in. With RMC gone, I load up vrCinema3D, a virtual movie theater.

I'm playing a Tron 3D clip, but the sound doesn't work. It doesn't matter though. I feel like I'm sitting in a movie theater. Despite the low resolution, viewing the movie was very natural. I could easily see this replacing the need for a home cinema setup, especially if it's just you watching. RMC comes back and tells me he's watching almost all of Finding Nemo 3D on the Rift with this app. If I get closer to the screen, the resolution seems better on the movie. Watching it from far away makes it a little blurry. This is one experience that will benefit from the improved resolution of the consumer model. I don't think anyone will be disappointed.

**MinecRift**

I really wanted this to work. For half a second, it did. I jacked into my uniquely rendered world and began looking around. For some reason, though, it kept exiting full screen. Then when I'd go back to full screen, the head tracking didn't work. We rebooted it a few times with no success. Not wanting to waste my previous Rift time trouble shooting, we moved on. Sorry Minecraft fans!

**First Law**

This is a good example of a game that looks completely different in the Rift than on the monitor. It was a lot of fun to fly around in space, spawn enemies, and track and shoot them. The cockpit was very convincing. I loved it. How fast am I going? I'll just glance down to the right. Where's that ship flying. I'll just look over my left shoulder. It was also cool seeing my guns on the side. Nothing looks the same on a monitor as it does in the Rift. I don't care if you're doing SBS cross-eyed parallel viewing while cupping your hands. It's not even close, folks. It's impossible to describe. 

**Proton Pulse**

VR the way VR was meant to be played - circa the 90s! It's 3D pong where your paddle is controlled with your head. I remember playing a similar browser-based game in high school 13 years ago. This was a lot of fun. Very simply, yet addicting. Most 90s VR movies had Proton Pulse-like graphics!

**Conclusion**

And just like that, my two hours were up. I only had to take one break, and that was after a 30 minute session with HL2. Am I getting my VR legs already? RMC says he can go hours and hours now. I'm jealous. For some reason, my second session with the Rift was even better than my first. I feel like my first journey I did a lot of standing in place analyzing what I was seeing. This time I had a lot of game play to go along with the visuals, and I just had a blast from beginning to end.

Take the time to get the Rift as perfect for you as possible. The extended FOV was a WORLD of difference for me. I need to find out my IPD so I can make those adjustments as well. I think the audio also helps with immersion, so use headphones if you can! I never noticed the screen door this go round. The resolution was somewhat noticeable when viewing a movie or looking in the distance in HL2, but it was also something that was easily forgotten. Head tracking was perfect, as always (except for poor MinecRift).

I am never ever going to forget going through that Half Life 2 intro in the Rift. It was a familiar game for me. And yet everything was new again. I couldn't believe how good it was - and I didn't even get to any combat! My previous journey into the Rift left me a little out of it, but this time I already want to jump back into HL2 as quickly as I can! And I want to try TF2! And RiftAmp! And Among the Sleep! And, and...!

Yesterday I politely asked about the possibility of Rift support in the comments &amp; this morning I received a very encouraging private message from Pantera. They have shown interest in implementing the Rift &amp; asked for me to spread the word. This is me spreading the word.

They also tweeted about it on their twitter account so all you twitter types please express your interest there too:

I found the dev kit version for pre-order in Japan at [this site](http://gamegadget.ocnk.net/product/214) for 49,800 yen. No word on who they're destined for exactly.

The Oculus Rift isn't featured much in current Japanese headlines, though, like Google News Japan. I lived in Tokyo for several years and I know that the Rift is going to be really, really big over there. It needs a proper media rollout, with careful explanation of the device's sensory capabilities and most importantly assuring the Japanese that it's safe for their eyes (they're super obsessed with health and safety). The celebrity TV ""talentos"" trying the Rift and freaking out should be dynamite. It also wouldn't hurt to send the cherubic Palmer Luckey over there for some promotion that brings hordes of shrieking J-girls to their knees, Elijah Wood-style.

I can't wait to see what Japan has in store for Oculus, and I'm not saying that because they're guaranteed to be the pioneers of VR porn. Japan has sort of fallen to second place after the West in the game development world, but they are still fantastic artists and creators, and a major gaming territory.

Lots of new people are hearing about the Oculus Rift for the first time so it's good that everyone is getting excited and sharing a lot of information and so forth. 

The problem is that there is a lot of misinformation flying around too. /r/oculus is becoming popular enough to warrant an FAQ, even if it is mostly a cut and paste job, to A) cut the fat of the discussions somewhat and B) limit the amount of repeat information that's going on. For example: 

- introducing The Leap. There have been five or six since I've been on here and we all know what it is. 
- showing off one of a handful of game/software demos that have been posted half a dozen times. 
- asking if the light on the devkit is a camera. It's not. 
- about the Oculus Rift's viability as an AR device. This has been discussed to death and it always boils down to it being only a VR device and not an AR device. 
- posts about the Oculus Rift + ________ (insert Mirror's Edge, Skyrim etc here). 

All of these have been covered to death. I know everyone is excited and wants to have a discussion and so forth which is fine which is why I'm suggested more of a general house cleaning than a strict set of rules. Like, if someone posts a beaten-to-death topic for the umpteenth time, mods could delete it and tell the user to ""Read the FAQ"" before posting. 

I think that repeat discussion threads are okay as long as they haven't been beaten to death like the old ones or aren't just links to websites/videos/whatever that have already been linked to a dozen times. 

Don't get me wrong... I'm grateful for the newcomers. I was getting tired of refreshing my phone's Reddit app to see absolutely nothing new. Now it's the opposite problem: it feels like the same 15 posts ad infinitum.

Because the Rift is right in front of your eyes and covers your field of view (almost) entirely, I assume that every object will be displayed at its real size.
What I mean is that with a regular monitor, your FOV is usually zoomed out pretty far. This means that we perceive things to be much further away in games than they actually are. Realism oriented games that require properly scaled environments (such as flight sims, shooters like the Arma series and Red Orchestra 2) address these issues by giving us keybinds that let us adjust the field of view on the fly, to give you both the ability to see out into the distance like in real life or to get a wide FOV.

Now, with the Rift, if things are all displayed at the correct scale, it could have a heavy impact on the way we perceive distance and scale in games. 

The ""compressed"" landscapes in open world games like Skyrim will will be more apparent, we will suddenly see that the major towns are sometimes barely 700m away from each other. In first person shooters, we'll suddenly notice that what the game calls sniper range is actually barely beyond spitting distance, and shotgun spreads will feel completely absurd. 

Basically, what I'm saying is that it may be that developers will have to cater to the Rift in unexpected ways simply because of the change in perspective.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_16y03f,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/16y03f/the_rift_and_distance/,
1375979866.0,31,self.oculus,1jyqgr,How to set up Tridef 3D,31,0,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1jyqgr/how_to_set_up_tridef_3d/,"Tridef 3D is currently the best third-party driver to run non-Rift-compatible with Rift. I have a post [**here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1joviq/working_tridef_3d_profile_settings/) where there are settings for values I use, but I've noticed that those values might for some reason change when restarting the game. And because of people's different kind of FOVs, IPDs and mouse sensitivities many of these values are wrong. That's why I made a little step-by-step tutorial for you to set up everything by yourself.

Tridef can be downloaded [**here**](http://www.tridef.com/download). You can use the trial for 14 days.
Tridef Oculus Rift integration can be downloaded [**here**](http://www.tridef.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=3907&amp;p=18327)

1. Open up Tridef. If your game is not on the list, add it. Make a new profile for it unless there is already one.  
2. Open the game through Tridef.  
3. Continue/load/start the game, find yourself a spot where you can idle. (Do not wear Rift yet)  
4. Open up the game's settings and change mouse sensitivity to something you like (I recommend slow because of Rift, but not too slow so you can make &gt;90 degree turns). Turn V-sync and mouse acceleration off.  
5. If available, adjust fov the biggest you can get. This way objects should not disappear from the edges of your vision.  
6. Open OSD by pressing numpad 0  
7. Put Rift on, go to HMD settings and change ""Force FOV"" to ""both"", then adjust ""Output fov"" so that you can't anymore see the black edges when looking forwards. (110-120 works usually for me)  
8. Adjust ""Game fov"" so that it doesn't look like zoomed in (fov too small) or weird warping at the edges of your vision (fov too big).   
9. Roll your head. If the game world seems to squish, find ""Image Stretch"" and set it to 0 (Fallout 3 is the only game I've encountered this).  
10. Take Rift off and go to head-tracking settings. Set yaw and pitch to ""on"" and auto-detect ""off"".   
11. Keep your Rift straight forward, then turn it 90 degrees to left or right.  
12. Look at the game. If your character has turned over 90 degrees, make ""Yaw scale"" bigger and if less than 90 then make it smaller.  
13. Put Rift facing forward again. Then turn it left and right to test the head-tracking is correct.  
14. Then look all the way up and all the way down with Rift. Adjust ""Pitch scale"" so that in-game up-down is 1:1 with Rift moving up and down.  
15. Go to 3D settings and check that ""Depth level"" is 30, then go back to HMD settings.  
16. This is a tricky part. Adjust ""World scale"" so that the world feels right. With too big values everything looks too small/too close.  
17. ""OSD depth"" is usually good in 0.0-0.10, try yourself if the game has a crosshair. ""Output quality"" is best as ""High"".  
18. Yaw and Pitch scales reset when you restart the game. You should write them down.

If you want to set up Tridef yourself, [here are the instructions](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1jyqgr/how_to_set_up_tridef_3d/).  
  
If you can, always try to set the Fov from game settings to as high as you can (120 should be enough)!  
  
    
**Bioshock 1**  
* Mouse sensitivity: 1, minimum  
* Yaw scale: -400  
* Pitch scale: -400  
* Output FoV: 120  
* Game FoV: 120  
* World scale: 5  
* Depth level: 30  
* Anything special?: Must be launched with -dx9 in launch options. Mouse acceleration must be disabled, see how it's done [here.](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=129822360) Disable everything in graphics options except windowed mode. Head-tracking might be buggy.    
  
**Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth**  
* Mouse sensitivity: 2  
* Yaw scale: -1400  
* Pitch scale: -1500  
* Output FoV: 110  
* Game FoV: 115  
* World scale: 4  
* Depth level: 30  
* Anything special?: Some insanity effects on your screen. Sometimes cutscene that takes control of your camera. Innsmouthians look scary.  
  
**Chivalry: Medieval Warfare**  
* Mouse sensitivity: Minimum  
* Yaw scale: -1700  
* Pitch scale: -2000  
* Output FoV: 110  
* Game FoV: 110 (110 also from game options)  
* World scale: 2  
* Depth level: 30  
* Anything special?: For some reason very demanding. Had to change to lowest possible settings with 1280x800 to get 50-60fps. Looking up and down moves your whole characters upper body, might feel weird.  
   
**Dark Messiah of Might and Magic**  
[**Gameplay video**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i5ygIyUGaQ)  
* Mouse sensitivity: 9  
* Yaw scale: -425  
* Pitch scale: -405  
* Output FoV: 100  
* Game FoV: 100  
* World scale: 3  
* Depth level: 30  
* Anything special?: Head bob is pretty wild, you can disable it from options. Because of the huge FoV, some objects and walls might disappear at the edges of your vision. Mouse acceleration and head-tracking is buggy with fast turning.  
  
**Dear Esther**    
* Mouse sensitivity: Default  
* Yaw scale: -700  
* Pitch scale: -750  
* Output FoV: 105  
* Game FoV: 105  
* World scale: 3  
* Depth level: 30  
* Anything special?: Enable ""Ignore Windows mouse speed"". Turn on developers console, open it and type ""sv_cheats 1"" and ""fov_desired 120"". Water is buggy, but some of the reflections can be turned off by typing ""r_WaterDrawReflection 0"" and ""r_WaterDrawRefraction 0"" into console (may require alt-tabbing to get it work). Lots of stairs and hills, some might get motionsick.
  
**The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind**   
[Gameplay video 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJkpmhqVXE)  
[Gameplay video 2 (different lightning mode)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MolWaBaVF2s)  
[Gameplay video 3 (playable settings)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50bfWs5bB7Y)  
This requires some work but as one of my favourite games I try to make it as playable as possible. 3D and headtracking work perfectly, but there are still couple problems, see ""Anything special"".  
  
Here are the instructions to set everything up like in third video:  
  
1. You need to have Morrowind with Tribunal and Bloodmoon installed. Then you need to download [MGE XE](http://morrowind.nexusmods.com/mods/41102/?).  
2. Open MGEXEgui.exe. Recommended reso is 1280x800. Change FoV to 130. Keep Distant Land disabled, it doesn't work with Rift. From ""In-game""-tab check ""Disable internal MWSE"" and ""Crosshair autohide"". 
3. Open ""Macro editor"" and bind some keys (I use k and l) to increase and decrease fov. You can then close the MGEXEgui and it'll save the settings and use them when you run Morrowind.  
3. Open up Morrowind.ini from your Morrowind folder and change ""Font 0=Magic_Cards_Regular"" to ""Font 0=century_gothic_big""  
4. Launch Morrowind through TriDef 3D and set the Tridef settings.  
5. With k and l (or whatever keys you used) correct the fov.  
6. If you have fps problems, reduce the view distance from game settings.  
  
Tridef 3D settings:  
* Mouse sensitivities: 1 and 1   
* Yaw scale: -360  
* Pitch scale: -340  
* Output FoV: 105  
* Game FoV: 80  
* World scale: 2  
* Depth level: 30  
* Anything special?: Water is buggy. Stay away from water. Do not look at water. HUD not visible.
  
**Fallout 3** (with unofficial patch and couple graphic mods)  
* Mouse sensitivity: 1  
* Yaw scale: -1200  
* Pitch scale: -1300  
* Output FoV: 120  
* Game FoV: 118  
* World scale: 3  
* Depth level: 30  
* Anything special?: Launch with -dx9 in launch settings. If head roll squeezes the world, try setting Image Stretch to 0. Mouse with Pip-boy doesn't work. Game doesn't like fraps, changing 3D on and off or alt+tabbing.  
  
**Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon**   
[**Gameplay video**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj-hFXAp7_g)  
* Mouse sensitivity: Minimum  
* Yaw scale: -1000  
* Pitch scale: -950  
* Output FoV: 105  
* Game FoV: 110 (100 from game settings)  
* World scale: 0.06  
* Depth level: 30   
* Anything special?: Fps dropped to 30-40 in bases with lowest settings possible. Lots of flashing lights and explosions.  
  
**Mirror's Edge**  
* Mouse sensitivity: minimum  
* Yaw scale: -1000  
* Pitch scale: -600  
* Output FoV: 120  
* Game FoV: 110  
* World scale: 3  
* Depth level: 30  
* Anything special?: Contains lots of cutscenes which take control of your camera. Contains also lot of jumping, climbing, rolling etc. that can make you sick. Mouse sensitivity should be at minimum.  
  
**Portal**  
* Mouse sensitivity: 2  
* Yaw scale: -1150  
* Pitch scale: -1300  
* Output FoV: 110  
* Game FoV: 110  
* World scale: 1  
* Depth level: 30  
* Anything special?: Enable ""Raw data"" from mouse options.  
  
**Portal 2**  
* Mouse sensitivity: default  
* Yaw scale: -690  
* Pitch scale: -710  
* Output FoV: 110  
* Game FoV: 110  
* World scale: 1  
* Depth level: 30  
* Anything special?: Enable ""Ignore Windows mouse speed"". Put ""r_waterdrawreflection 0"" to console if water looks buggy (might require alt+tabbing to get it work). Do not use anti-aliasing.
  
**S.T.A.L.K.E.R.** (CoP with Misery 2)

**S.T.A.L.K.E.R.** (SoC with AMK)  
[**Gameplay video**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2GlRkS9fxw)    
* Mouse sensitivity: minimum  
* Yaw scale: -900  
* Pitch scale: -1200  
* Output FoV: 110  
* Game FoV: 105  
* World scale: 0.05  
* Depth level: 30   
* Anything special?: HUD, inventory and chat with NPCs is out of your field of view/too big to see everything. Safe HMD FOV mode helps a bit.    
  
**Tribes: Ascend**  
[**Gameplay video**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u97Xmcw3Td8)    
* Mouse sensitivity: 30.000

***How To***
- In the game go to video settings and set resolution to 1280 x 800 (haven't tried others yet)
- Bring up Tridef controls ( number PAD 0 )

Scene Depth = 77

World Scale = 1.00
Force FOV = Both
Output FOV = 101

OSD Depth = .05
Output Quality = High

I just found one for Halo 2, but you have to start the game, then go back to windows use the program to disable HUD.  If you die, then you have to repeat the process.

Valve is clearly very interested in the Rift. They released two of the few games with official Rift support early on (Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2.) They've also modded the Source engine to easily allow Rift support and Gabe Newell has spoken highly of the Rift.

The Half-Life games are both notable not only for being great games in their own right, but for setting new standards of realism and immersion in games. In the first, it was about the constant first-person perspective with scripted events instead of cutscenes and no player speech, as well as the sheer attention to detail in terms of atmosphere. In the second, it was about the Source engine's amazing graphics (especially facial expressions) and physics engine. Half-Life 3 will probably be the game to showcase and become the benchmark for virtual reality.

Although it may seem odd to not announce Half-Life 3 until roughly a year before its release, keep in mind the same thing happened with Half-Life 2. Valve wants virtual reality to become a phenomenon, and they know if they release Half-Life 3 shortly after the Oculus Rift, it would easily become the Rift's killer app and motivate lots of people to buy one (although I very highly doubt it will require Rift support to run.)

Valve has waited so long to release Half-Life 3 because they want it to be more than just a major commercial success. They want it to be a historical landmark and new standard in the same way the previous two games were, only to an even greater extent.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1ijd6n,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1ijd6n/a_serious_post_about_halflife_3/,

amazed.  amazing equivalent to the first time I played a 3d game or an online MMO with friends.  Feels revolutionary, and I am really excited about the future.

*Screen Quality:  Needs work, but by no means was I hugely disappointed by the resolution.  I was a little disappointed you can see black off to the sides more than I was expecting, but once you start to get into the world you are in, you forget about it.

*Motion Sickness:  Only in War Thunder, played around in demos for nearly 2.5 hours and feel great.

*Negatives: Screen and the black bars on the side of your vision.  I am struggling to find bad things to say. 

*Demos:

Titans of Space:  Glad I started with this, truly epic sense of scale and the 3d drifting particles were a nice touch too.  I literally said fuuuuuuck in astonishment at one point.  Amazing immersion when looking down and seeing your ""body"".  Highly recommended.

Tuscany:  A lot has been said about this, so I will spare, but I guess it was the first demo that showed me how much more immersive standing while using the rift is.  Also was amazed at the sense of presence that the ledges, stairs, and roof gave. 

Architecture Demo:  This was posted a while back, like a simpler Tuscany demo...meh skip it.  

Yunalus:  NSFW demo where it seems you are a toddler wandering around some Anime High School girls apartment.  The 3D effect is used to great effect here.  Yep. 

Minecrift:  Killer App.  I was completely blown away by this mod.  It was absolutely incredible wandering around in 3D and being able to look in all directions.  The 3D effect is incredible and immersive.  Walking up to a sheep or a pig is almost startling.  I can see myself Noping the fuck out while mining in a deep cave.  The menu system is really well executed and I am pretty surprised by the polish.  

HL2:  Amazing as well, but will def benefit from a higher res screen.  It is eerie walking up to the characters.  Hard to describe to someone who hasn't used it, but it felt uncomfortable to fuck with the combine.  Walking outside for the first time and seeing a strider shambling by was incredible.  I probably wont be playing through the whole game considering I pussed out in ravenholm on a 2d screen almost 10 years ago when it was released.

1373190543.0,29,self.oculus,1hsob4,Tried the Rift two days ago - a few thoughts,33,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1hsob4/tried_the_rift_two_days_ago_a_few_thoughts/,"I had the opportunity to try the Rift a few days ago.  Here are my initial impressions.  First, a few caveats: I was wearing glasses with the Rift, which were uncomfortable, and blurred the optics a little.  I was also using a Rift that wasn't calibrated to my IPD, etc.  

When I first put the device on, it was running a calibration utility (with a door, a mannequin, and a car).  The result was astounding.  The sense of presence was tangible and I started swearing pretty much immediately.  I was pretty thoroughly shaken by the experience. 

I had the opportunity to try the Riftcoaster, Tuscany Hydra, and Blue Marble demos.  I also got a chance to try HL2, but the owner of the Rift was still working out some kinks with that, so I wasn't able to move much in it.  

In terms of the device itself, the low resolution was not nearly as bad as I'd feared.  It wasn't fantastic, but it was quite a bit clearer than my vision typically is without glasses.  Objects within ten feet or so looked reasonably clear.  It really only showed itself when looking at thin objects, or far away things, which tend to degrade into pixelated messes.  In short, it isn't good enough, but only barely.  The 1080p version should be fine for most purposes.  The screen door effect was also grossly overstated.  It was there, but I didn't find it to be distracting, or even noticeable unless I paid particular attention.  The motion blur was a bigger problem - it was a little bit upsetting when I turned my head rapidly, and made the latency feel worse than it was.  There was also obviously quite a bit of poor color performance on the panel they're using: the world looked washed and flat out compared to the real one, or even the image rendered on his other screen.  

In the demos, while it was all impressive, there is a tangible difference between the world in the Rift and the world in reality, and my brain didn't quite believe it most of the time - however, there were a few moments where the illusion really clicked.  I found that making sure I was positioned like my virtual body really helped.  Proprioception is powerful.  There were a couple of parts, standing in Tuscany, where I'd look over at a book or a window ledge, and it just felt so real.  The asteroids going past in Blue Marble also did it for me.  By far the most powerful, though, was kneeling on the floor of the trainstation at the beginning of HL2 staring at a package of chinese food.  I was down on my knees in real life, and we'd crouched the character, so the heights worked out pretty much exactly.  I looked at the chinese food container, and it looked so real that I could reach out and touch it.  Then I looked up, and saw the huge train station looming over me, and Breen's face on the monitor.  The sense of scale was shocking and oppressive, and I felt very, very small and powerless.  I will never feel the same way about that level again.  Every part of my brain was convinced that it was real.  Pixels and color performance and 2004-era graphics were forgotten.  It was an incredible moment.  Better technology will provide more of those moments, and I look forward to it.       

A note on nausea: I didn't experience any simulator sickness per se -- however, I did find that spinning with the thumbstick in the Tuscany demo for more than a fraction of a second gave me a nasty headache almost immediately.  I was able to get around fine, but the moment I started relying on it to look around, my head started to throb.  I also experienced what I'm going to term a 'VR hangover' for about 30 minutes after I got out of the device.  The real world seemed different, and there was a pronounced sense of disquiet, possibly attributable to my vestibular system complaining about being ignored.   

Will report back with new findings when I get the chance to play with it again.  ",,False,self,t5_2uni5,1373191389.0,,,True,t3_1hsob4,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1hsob4/tried_the_rift_two_days_ago_a_few_thoughts/,

I implemented support for it and released the source under LGPL: https://code.google.com/p/vrpaint/  
However I will not continue the project, as it requires a lot of investment and I do not see much of a return (makes me cut a lot of corners..). It works with the Oculus Rift (hence me posting it here), but it still requires a lot of tweaking to make work properly. For instance, one thing I learned is that (although quite obviously) is that letting the head roll, but not being able to apply the proper stereoscopic view, is very weird in VR. Imagine having your head tilted to your shoulder, but your left eye and right eye receiving an image with an offset in the horizontal axis instead of the vertical axis (although being tilted properly). This was an issue I couldn't work out with the Oculus Rift, without making sacrifice(s). This is an important issue for VR 3D (!) video playing as well, so if you're looking into that, this might be interesting to try out. Reprojection doesn't have this problem, but needs other sacrifices, but I figure reprojection might be better.  
  
To try it out with the Oculus Rift, you can launch the batch file and select the Oculus Rift stereomode. Set the screenwidth to 1280 and the screen height to 800. Set the internal screenwidth to 640 and height to 800 again. Set the FOV to approx 110 degrees. Play around with decoupling the camera, sensitivities and the application input settings if you want to actually create something. Close the settings window (it will save the settings) and close the OpenGL window. Restart the application and the Oculus Rift will now initialize.  
  
Again, apologies for the poor coding practices if you're reading the source :) It's very proof of concept so I didn't bother with it.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1dzxtz,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1dzxtz/release_and_abandoning_of_vrpaint/,

1376641208.0,31,self.oculus,1kh70s,Tridef updated Oculus Beta to 3.7.6b4 - list of enhancements within.,33,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1kh70s/tridef_updated_oculus_beta_to_376b4_list_of/,"[Official Forum](http://www.tridef.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=3907)
Changes in 3.7.6b4:
The following changes have been made:

* All HMD settings will now save correctly.

* The TriDef OSD will now be drawn so that it is readable on the Rift by default. If you prefer the old style (so that it is readable on a cloned monitor) then change ‘HMD Settings -&gt; OSD on HMD’ to ‘Off’

* We have added a new TriDef display profile for the Rift. Oculus Rift (Desktop Res) will output a game to the Rift at your current desktop resolution.

* Aspect ratio is now handled correctly for any game resolution. This allows you to select game resolutions with ‘vertical’ aspect ratios such as 640 x 800.

* Aspect ratio is now handled correctly for any output resolution. Note that if using an output resolution other than the Rift’s native 1280 x 800 you will need to ensure that the image is stretched to the entire display and never cropped or padded with black. You might need to change your graphics card driver to ‘Enable GPU Scaling’ to do this.

* There is a new experimental option via the ‘HMD Settings -&gt; Additional Resolution’ sub menu. The Width and Height entered here should appear as a selectable display mode in-game. You can use this to have the game render at your own custom resolution for each eye (eg 800 x 800) while still outputting to the Rift using a real display mode (eg 1280 x 800). We recommend using this with the Oculus Rift (1280 x 800) or Oculus Rift (Desktop Res) display profiles. With the Oculus Rift (Game Res) display profile Ignition will still output using a real display mode. It will try to match this to the game’s display mode as closely as possible but this may not be suitable for optimal 3D. There is also a setting for Refresh Rate in the ‘Additional Resolution’ sub-menu. Unless you are an expert (and already over-clocking your Rift) you should just leave this at 60 Hz. Ignition will only output with a real refresh rate so this is just a guide for what refresh rate it should choose.

* You can now temporarily reduce the output size of the image so that you can read game text that might otherwise be too far to the side of your view. Hold down the ‘Force Safe HMD FOV’ button (by default this is Numpad +) to change the Output FOV to a customizable Safe FOV. You can also set the ‘Safe FOV’ in the ‘HMD Settings’ sub-menu.

* If the Head Tracking -&gt; Yaw Scale is wrong the view will no longer ‘pop’ at the 180 degree yaw mark.

* OSD key repeat rate now accelerates over time allowing you to make faster changes when holding down a key.

* Increased the Yaw Scale and Pitch Scale maximum range to +/- 5000.

* Fixed an issue where Restore Default Settings could accidentally switch to Power 3D mode. (Power 3D mode isn’t currently supported for the Rift).

*I hasn’t made it into this beta release but we are looking into adding support for head tracking when using a game controller. We’ll keep you posted on this.

*Our focus has been on adding and refining features but we have added Rift support for some new games. Please see the first post for more details on how to set them up correctly.

* Metro 2033
* Portal
* rFactor 2
* TrackMania Nations Forever (no Head Tracking)
* Proun (no Head Tracking)

It was transcendental. I spent all day playing with it, then I passed out from VR exhaustion (like physical exhaustion except only for your eyes and your ass)



At 2:30 in the morning I'm awoken by loud techno music; My room is just outside the living room of my house and my room mates had come home from the bar. My first reaction was ""Fuck these people I hope they die in a fire, I'm going back to sleep"" When I couldn't, I decided to get out of bed and go enjoy my life, because they certainly seemed to be doing so.  



I instantly regretted it when I walked out and the first (slurred) words I heard were ""Carpe_DMT, you are a fucking MASSIVE **FAGGIT**"". My room mate's brother was there and apparently he was drunker than drunk because -20 seconds after introducing himself he proceeded to antagonize me at a second grade level; begging me to hit him, making fun of my shirt and throwing popsicle sticks at me.

More than anything else it was funny, I played along and kept everyone laughing about it rather than feeding his energy. His friends were perplexed as to why he was suddenly so pissed off, repeatedly assuring ""He's not normally like this"" ""dude what are you doing why are you so pissed off"" etc etc. Our interactions continued as such for another hour before the conversation lulled and the others drunkenly decided they wanted drugs. 



   I couldn't get the rift out of my mind the whole time this was going on so it was then that I *expertly* slipped in the suggestion ""HEY YOU GUYS you know what the best escape from reality is? *virtual reality*. I just got these goggles try them etc etc"" at which everyone laughed because it was stupid, then proceeded to forget about my suggestion. Everyone but Drunky McAsshat, who seemed even more incensed than he'd been, and then he proceeded to follow me about as I gathered the kit and started to set it up, determined to put this thing on *somebody's* face. ""VIRTUAL REALITY? YOU FUCKING LIAR FAGGOT YOU DUMBASS. You're so fucking stupid you...you got locked out of your room what's wrong with you fuck you hit me. What the fuck is in that plastic suitcase? your dildo? go fuck yourself yooou fucking piece of- **HOLY GODDAMN ASS CRACKING CHRIST IS THAT THE DEV KIT!?!?!?!?**

**YOU HAVE A DEV KIT?!!**



**ARE WE BEST FRIENDS NOW!!!??!!**""




Instant, *instant* 180º. Now he won't stop gushing. He is like a kid in a candy store.  He cannot wait for me to plug it in, to the point that rather than look at the thing any longer he has gone into the other room and started proselytizing everybody into the church of the latter day oculus rift. ""THIS THING WILL CHANGE THE WORLD OF ENTERTAINMENT. EVERYONE WILL HAVE ONE. IT IS THE FUTURE."" I mean, I'm impressed. this guy's talking about the 1080P version and stuff, apparently he really knows what this thing is and what it can do. 

 

He slips on Tuscany and he creams his pants. I was worried that somebody so drunk would get so *very* sick in VR but it seemed his enthusiasm overcame that. In fact it seems to have made him dead sober. everything I show him isn't enough. He craves more. ""DO YOU HAVE TF2??! LET ME PLAY TF2"" 


I treat him to some other demos and I let him play the opening of half life 2. He's grinning like a kid on Christmas. ""*HOLY SHIT* I'm *in* this train station. That guy with the broom is scary. How do I get through this gate. Oh it's the other gate! This cop hit me. How do I climb a ladder? What do you mean I have to pick up a can? How do I pick up cans? Oh the same as boxes"" and so on. Eventually I leave the room to have a smoke, satisfied that he won't break it or vomit on my keyboard. 

Every few minutes I come back in, he's still in the rift. He can't get enough. By this point it's 4:30, and everybody's tired, and he's wired. By the time he takes the thing off it's light out and he's confused about it. ""Dude, I...I'm sorry about earlier. I didn't know you were a *dev*. Things are different. Are we cool?""

We were cool.

1372521023.0,29,self.oculus,1hbbrc,Increasing the Rifts physical IPD - A weekend mod,29,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1hbbrc/increasing_the_rifts_physical_ipd_a_weekend_mod/,"After discovering that my IPD is around 70-72mm and realizing that as a result my eyes were not exactly centered over the lens cups, I decided to do a little experimenting over last weekend.

I noticed that while wearing the Rift, if I shifted the HMD so that my left (or right) eye was more centered over its respective lens, I was able to eliminate much of the blurring which occurred on each of my peripheries. It became immediately obvious that if I was able to move both lens cups outwards by just a few millimeters I'd probably get a much clearer view of the screen in general. This led to a very simple and cheap mod, which so far is doing wonders for my viewing experience.

I needed some way to avoid using the bayonet twist system that attaches the cups to the HMD, Without cutting or damaging anything in the process. The most logical solution to this was to take either the B or C cups and use a 'riser' of sorts so that they'd sit at the same focal length, and at the same time allow them to be moved outwards ever so slightly. I happened to have some stiff foam that was exactly 5mm thick with adhesive on one side. This was a great place to start.

Using the C cups, I discovered that the 5mm the foam provided made the C's just as high as the A's. (One thing to note is that all the lenses seem to be exactly the same, the only difference is their relative focal lengths due to the distance away from the screen).

I cut out two foam rings with an inner diameter of ~56mm, which is the internal diameter of the lens cups. Take note that they can't be perfect circles. They need to be slightly oval-ish in order to allow the lenses to sit a bit further apart, if you get what I mean.

Small notches in the spots where HMD bayonet fixtures stick out had to be cut in order to have a nice flat surface for the foam to sit on. Then I affixed the lens cups to the adhesive side of the foam, ensuring that the lenses were placed 'off-center' in order to increase the IPD a little.

Once I had both new C lenses with foam adapters seated just right, I taped them down. No, this is not a pretty job, but then it doesn't need to be. The lenses are held firmly enough that they do not move, and that's really all that matters. 

Here's a very short [image gallery](http://imgur.com/a/5qgQV) of what they look like. I would have taken more photos but I only thought to photograph just before I started mounting everything.

Before I put everything together I placed one of my foam adapted lenses on one side, and a regular A lens on the other. This wasn't the most scientific of experiments, but I perceived *far* greater clarity through the adapted lens than I did through the regular A lens.

Anyway. I figure I should share this idea with others, just incase anyone else wants to go messing with this sorta stuff. I really do feel like it made a noticeable impact on my viewing experience. My eyes are now centered much closer to the center of each lens, and that's killed a lot of peripheral blur for me.

The up-side is that the entire thing is reversible and I can just switch to A's if needs be (not that I think I'll ever need to again). Sadly this might not such a great mod for those who need to use the C's :(

Initial impressions and a shaky start,33,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1cfpwp/order_1707_reporting_in_initial_impressions_and_a/,"Just received the kit a few hours ago!  Stellar presentation with the box, etc, but I'm sure you all have watched unboxing vids at this point :)

Some vitals: I'm 28 and am considerably nearsighted (don't remember the exact numbers, sorry) and one eye is a bit worse than the other.  The 'C' lenses (most nearsighted) give me the best image.  I have the Rift depth adjusted to the halfway mark.  Currently attempting to use the Rift without my glasses.

Fired up TF2 and calculated IPD per the instructions [here](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Oculus_Rift_User_Guide).  Loaded into a training match and *holy crap*.  I stood at the entrance and simply gazed at the environment.  Crates, lockers, my gun, the ceiling.  A surreal feeling.  Tried moving around and got a pang of nausea, so I stood still a bit longer.

Once I recovered I walked around the level a bit.  One strange thing I noticed is I kept moving my head left/right and up/down, as though I was looking with a mouse.  Funny how years of FPS movement ingrain certain movements like that... it's going to take some unlearning to look around and traverse the environment in a ""normal"" fashion.

I'd say my first session only lasted about five minutes before I had to jack out due to nausea.  Walked around, got some fresh air and a glass of water.  Sat down for round two and only lasted about five minutes again.  I was able to move a bit more that time :)

I think I'm going to crank the depth out all the way and give the 'A' lenses a try with my glasses.  Will report back with findings.  So far though it's looking like due to my poor vision and disparity between eyes I might be better off picking up some contacts for my Rift diving.

Edit:

I was able to focus much better using my glasses!  ~~Unfortunately there is also a decent amount of pressure on my nose which is uncomfortable.~~  Loosened the strap considerably and the pressure on my nose almost completely went away.  I feel like the glasses reduced some of my nausea, so maybe part of it was the fact my eyes are different prescriptions.  Still couldn't make it past ~5 minutes.

TF2 is a bit intense (even as a heavy) so at this point I'm gonna try out the Tuscany demo w/ Razer Hydra.

Edit:

Tuscany demo felt better but the low resolution was screwing with my want to really take in the scene.  If I looked around taking in the scene as a whole it was okay, but say I wanted to examine the wood texture on a table.  That is when the screen door effect would come into play.  Also when I saw the tree outside in the distance I kept wanting to focus on the leaves, but the resolution simply isn't there.  Dev kit definitely works better for stuff up close or scenes as a whole.  At this point I went to sleep.

I will say I'm glad I read tips suggesting only taking small dips into the Rift at first, and that VR nausea is not something you can ""power through"".  It reminded me a lot of the feeling after getting off [carnival rides](http://i.imgur.com/f2LDifY.jpg). It doesn't immediately go away and tends to stack as the night goes on.  Once you're done, you're done.

So you don't make the same mistake I did... take extremely close heed to the warning in the Oculus Rift booklet and ALWAYS change the eye cups with the Rift front plate facing up such that dust can not fall INTO the open cup holes.

Even the most tinyest, itty bitty spec of dust that lands on the LCD screen will create a foreign particle in VR that is impossible not to notice. Think dead pixel but more annoying in VR because only one eye can see it. (Worse if each eye has it's own dust spec in different locations.)

I used a can of compressed air (some dust was stubborn) which resolved the issue.

Also another tip, if you are near sighted like me and use cup B or especially C you most likely have the side notches turned all the way so you are as close to the lens as possible. When attaching cup A to give someone a demo, setting the side notches about 3 notches back almost always vastly improved the comfort for those lucky 20/20 vision people.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1c2ifg,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1c2ifg/tip_for_new_rift_owners_who_expect_to_change_the/,

I don't mean the whole article should be negative, just that they acknowledge that something isn't good news. For instance with Unity they could just have said ""We tried but sadly we couldn't get rift support in the free version, because it requires features which are usually only in their pro version"" or something like that. The same goes for updates about shipping delays, they always sound like there never where better estimates.
I don't want them to be doom and gloom, the updates just sound like they avoid formulating any sentence which doesn't sound positive. And I find that grating.

To prevent misunderstandings: The things themselves don't bother me all that much, that Unity is pro only isn't that surprising. It would have been nice, and I'm sure it sucks for people who have already started doing things in the free version, but it is what it is. 
Also I always excepted delays for shipping, and I'm late in the line anyways.
I just don't like the forced positivity it makes me feel like I'm listening to a marketing department.

This one may be slightly more point form. :)

Got my rift (Japan) on Saturday. Due to my PC being at my girlfriend's place I wasn't able to get up and running until basically the next day, which was hell. 

I'll go through what I've tried in order then give some thoughts at the end.

Half Life 2: I tried this first basically because I already had it installed. Probably wasn't the best first game to try because there's too much movement. I felt sick after a very short time, and ended the demo after getting beat to death with a club by an enemy, which was traumatic in the most awesome way. Everything looks big or life size, but the screen door effect can be brutal in this game in bright areas or when looking out at something in the distance. I need to spend more time with HL2 after getting my legs.

Team Fortress 2: This was really my first WOW moment with the Rift. I played the guy that has a rocket launcher on his shoulder, and I really felt like I did have one. The game moves fast, so again, motion sickness but it was so fun that I didn't want to stop (even though I suck). I'd love to play with some other people who have Rifts.

Blue Marble: This was the first one I downloaded because I'd seen the YouTube video and it was impressive. In the Rift though I found the screen door effect extremely distracting because everything was so beautiful, but this black grid over top of it was annoying as hell. More on this later.

Tuscany: I've seen this a 100 times, so honestly I got bored really quick in here. The screen door again was annoying me because I wanted to check out the nice view from upstairs, but everything at a distance is blurry. I quit this pretty quick.

I wanted to try Rift Coaster but I can't get it to run in stereo mode, can someone tell me what I'm doing (or not doing) wrong?

At this point I was getting super VR sickness so I stopped for the day. Day 2 I felt refreshed and decided to dig in a bit more.

First up was..

Proton Pulse: I loved this game. No movement except looking around so I didn't feel VR sickness at all and I played for about half an hour. I'd love to see a full game made out of this with different level designs, music and powerups. Great game.

Buck Experimental Sandbox: This was also my first time using my Hydra, and I probably spent about 5 minutes just picking up boxes and throwing them. Having the Hydra to control your hands completely changes the experience in the Rift. I can't stress enough how much of a difference this makes in immersion. I completely forgot about the screen door because I was having so much fun throwing stuff. Great demo!

RiftRacer: Holy barfville. Cool demo of driving in the rift, but I got out of there ASAP. I don't know if driving games are going to be my thing. I really want to try iRacing with a wheel though.

Outerra: Cool tech demo. I want to pick up the Anteworld alpha when I can and fly the jet. I'm kind of excited about this game.

Mirror's Edge (Vireo): Got Vireo up and running so I decided to try out some of my traditional library of games. Mirror's Edge was one i'd been looking forward too, but I couldn't get the sensitivity right for the head tracking so I gave up on it. 

Dear Esther (Vireo): Decided to pick this up based on Cymatic Bruce's reccomendation. Really cool views, but once again the screen door killed this one for me. Once there is a higher resolution screen this should be really awesome in the rift.

Hawken: I dug into the config files and got Hawken up and running in the rift. Wow, this game is perfect for VR. The biggest problem with Hawken is that the scale of the cockpit is way off. It feels more like a helmet than a cockpit, and everything looks too small. This might be why it's taking a while to get Rift support if they have to re-work a lot of things. I felt too far back in the cockpit, so looking around had no benefits other than being able to see more of the cockpit. If I was further forward and could see more peripheral, it would be great. There's also no HUD in VR mode, which makes things harder. I'm really really really looking forward to the official support for this game though, it's going to be a hell of a lot of fun to play in VR.

Zombies On The Holodeck: Ok, this is it people. This game was another wow moment for me. Using the Hydra you can use weapons to aim in a realistic way. You can hold a weapon with both hands for better aim, and reloading is done by actually pumping your shotgun, or by pulling out the clip. It's a wave based zombie game like in Call Of Duty, but it's extremely immerse. I was blown away when I could actually look down the scope of the sniper rife naturally by holding it up to my eye. This is some seriously cool stuff and by far my favorite experience using Rift/Hydra. I hope they expand on it and add more weapons, locations etc. 

So that's what I've played so far. I'm probably going to try a few more demos today. Here's some main points:

Screen Door: This is much worse than I expected based on other people's impressions. It can be very, very annoying at times and immersion breaking. If you are on the fence about getting a dev kit, there is fun to be had with it, but the screen door is very much a problem that makes this unit not suitable for consumers at all. I'm really happy that people say it's not an issue on the newest prototype. My advice after some playtime would be to wait for a new version with a better screen. 

VR Sickness: Big problem for me, I tend to suffer from motion sickness, and this thing is KILLING me. I want to play it more but every 10 mins or so I want to hurl. Hopefully the feeling will pass with time as some say it does. 

Positional Tracking: This wasn't an issue for me at all. I didn't feel like anything was missing. If they can add it for the consumer version, awesome. If not, I don't think it will be a big deal for me. 

Games: Stuff designed for the Rift &gt; modded for the Rift. I've tried a couple other games with Vireo, and the experience is sub par. Even Team Fortress 2 which is awesome on the Rift was difficult to play because of text that was unreadable. The best experiences I've had so far have been those designed for the Rift (and using Hydra!!).

Overall I'm still just as excited about the technology as I have been, and I'm eager to see what comes next. I'm going to keep playing with my Rift and enjoying it. 

I really want to play a space combat or flight combat sim game with multiplayer. I watched a video of EVR on YouTube through the rift and that was intense. EVR and Star Citizen are my most anticipated games at the moment.

Ok that was long. Hope you liked my impressions! Back to rifting.

Edit: I forgot VR Cinema! This was easily one of the best demos. The screen is huge, and you really feel like you're sitting in a theater. I watched a bit of a 2D movie and I just downloaded Avatar 3D so I'm going to try that out. Once again though, I doubt I'll be watching any full length movies on the dev kit because it feels like holding a window screen right in front of your face. In the 1080p Rift this is going to be a killer app.

**[UPDATE]**

Updated the Epic Citadel version. It's a bit bigger now (320 Mb), as I have figured out how to use Swarm Rendering to put my multiple machines to good use. Broken lightmaps have been rebuild, and the citadel's lighting looks much, much better now. Can still be racked up a notch though (lighting maps quality is ""high"", highest setting is ""production"" but takes forever). Will let it run tonight and update again tomorrow.

Fixed the issue with not starting up in rift mode. Added bonus: as long as the game hasn't started, you are in flying mode. WASD for movement, and you fly into the direction you are looking with the rift. Brings you to places you can't access normally due to restraints.

Enjoy.

1371455714.0,25,self.oculus,1gi62a,The Oculus Rift is going to be a big deal,53,28,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1gi62a/the_oculus_rift_is_going_to_be_a_big_deal/,"There will probably be a number of other companies that make their own virtual reality headsets, but hopefully Oculus Rift is able to maintain dominance in the field, because well, I like Palmer Lucky.  He seems like a good guy.  And screw Sony. 

This virtual reality thing will likely be a really big deal.  Everyone who's tried the Oculus Rift so far says that it's mind blowing.  That is with the low-resolution developer kit.  We're not even talking about the first generation.  When it comes out in 2014 and hits the mass market, it's going be a huge success and it's going to blow a lot of minds.

It will blow minds in 2014.  After 2014 it will continue getting more refined so that you no longer see pixels and issues with motion sickness will get worked out.  The first applications, as with so many technologies before it, will be gaming and pornography.  It will transform those industries.  But it will change many other industries as well as how we communicate. 

Then some really unexpected things will likely happen. 

The thing to understand is that virtual reality is not a single technology, but a bunch of them all together: computers, motion sensors, motion capture software, rendering engines, and GPUs.  All of these technologies are converging on a high level of maturity and all at the same time.  What this means is that virtual reality environments will potentially be hyper realistic very soon, especially once we start virtualizing and clustering our GPUs.

The other thing to understand is that humans are pre-wired for virtual reality.  With the way that our perception systems work we already live in virtual reality.  We don't (and can't) perceive anything directly.  Reality for us is a model, a useful approximation of our environment created by our brain that is continually updated with information coming in from our senses.  Optical illusions do a good job of reminding us about this because the visual system is one of our faculties that does a particular lot of processing and filtering before any information reaches our consciousness.  Optical illusions happen when the mechanics of our visual system encounters a situation it wasn't prepared for and as a result stands naked for us to see. 

Neurologists already know the power and flexibility of the mind.  To our brain, everything is a tool, including our limbs and hands.  Doctors using the newest mechanical prosthetics know this.  The brain readily rewires itself and treats the mechanical limb as though its own. 

I remember reading about virtual reality experiments done five years ago in which out of body experiences were created.  It used a rudimentary motion capture system which would look ridiculous compared to the Kinect.  The researchers captured the subject's body movements and then applied those movements to an avatar.  So as the subject moved, so did the avatar, which the subject was shown via video feed.  The outcome was that the subject had an out of body experience and began to sense himself as being the avatar. 

There's another well known experiment which demonstrates a phenomenon known as the 'rubber hand illusion'.  This experiment doesn't use virtual reality, but will most certainly have ramifications for virtual reality.  There is a subject who sits at a desk and has a rubber hand (a blown-up latex glove works fine) in front of him.  He keeps his hands at his side.  There is also an assistant who has two paint brushes.  He brushes both the fake hand and one of the subject's real hands in the same way simultaneously.  It's important that the subject only sees the fake hand.  After a while the subject will begin to feel as though the fake hand is his real hand.  Apparently, the assistant will be able to stroke the fake hand only and the subject will feel it even though nothing is touching him!

What does this mean?  I think it means that virtual reality is going to be incredibly powerful and unexpectedly so. 

One of the things that's talked about a lot with violence in video games is whether it causes violent behavior.  The current educated opinion is that kids and people are able to tell the difference between games and reality.  But virtual reality may change that.  My guess is that certain games are going to be made illegal because they're too realistic.  Game publishers will be mandated to continuously remind people that they are in a game. But that may not be enough. What if become so desensitized that you lose a proper sense of fear when you're in the real world?

There's going to be a huge worldwide psychological impact when this technology catches on.  In terms of stimulation, nothing will be able to compare.  Nothing will be able to spike the dopamine levels like virtual reality short of meth.  The government will try to control it and ban it, but how do you do that?  VR headsets are simple hardware.  People will be able to make their own, much like people can already 3d print guns (which lawmakers already outlawed).  We are going to see a lot of  comparisons made between VR and drugs. 

Don't get me wrong.  I'm super excited about this.  But VR is going to prove to be an incredibly powerful technology, and as a result, there will be a lot of unintended consequences both good and bad.  But mostly bad.  Just kidding.

I can now go a few hours in TF2 or HL2 without any problems.

However, I was not really getting high levels of immersions (lots of distractions at home in the background) ... until last night.  On the recommendation of someone on the Oculus Official Forums I tried the Alone in The Rift demo whilst standing.

It was a completely different experience and increased my immersion level 10 fold.  Great ending in this demo by the way ...

I then decided to try the same thing in TF2.  Again the immersion level was far higher than when I played it sitting down.  Standing on top of a hill with the heavy (also with Hydra) spraying bullets down onto the enemy really DID feel like I was there.  Same experience with HL2.

Not sure if it is just me but one possible cause of this could be the height of the avatar's head not matching where I knew my head was, was breaking the illusion for me.

Either way, I recommend everyone to give this a go especially if you are not feeling the high levels of immersion you'd like to.

The downside of this is it was like my first night again with the Rift.  Managed about 15 minutes of HL2 but was getting the cold sweats and finding it very difficult to keep upright.  haha, such a strange sensation but I was wobbling around all over the place ... my girlfriend thought this was hilarious enough to take a video and share it with her buddies.  Which was nice of her!

Anyone else noticed such a difference in experience when standing compared to sitting with the Rift?",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1g42iq,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1g42iq/you_want_it_standing_up_or_sitting_down/,

Thought I would help users who want to make games or play around in something other than Unity or UDK

I will provide below instructions on how to use the fantastic Torque 3D engine.

the same engine used for the Rift Valley and Aurora Borealis demo's 

First you need to download 3 files

Torque 3D Engine
http://mit.garagegames.com/Torque3D-3-0.zip

Torque 3d Rift Template
http://mit.garagegames.com/Rift-Template-3-0.zip

Oculus VR SDK
https://developer.oculusvr.com/login (You will need to login to the Development Centre for the SDK)

Now you have those three files it's time to extract them.  

I will be using my folder structure but you can do it anyway you like

Extract Torque 3D to c:\Dev

Once done you will have a folder called c:\Dev\Torque3D

Now extract the Rift Template to c:\Dev\Torque3D\Templates

You will now have c:\Dev\Torque3D\Templates\Rift

Extract the Oculus SDK to c:\Dev

You will now have c:\Dev\OculusSDK

You have now setup the development environment :)    
***

  
  
    
    

------Generating a Game------    
To use Torque3D for oculus you need to start building your game.
to do this you need to use the Project Manager

c:\Dev\Torque3D\Project Manager.exe

You will now be see a screen that allows you to create projects
http://i.imgur.com/lknNu9R.jpg

Click the ""New Project"" button

Type the name of your game and select the Rift template in the dropdown box

Now before you click create you need to click ""Choose Modules""

http://i.imgur.com/3nzPKun.jpg

The Move Class and Networking module must be changed to ""ExtendedMove"" to use the rift headtracking.

You also need to Tick the Oculus VR Devices and put c:\Dev\OculusSDK as your path or whatever path you used.

Click ok    


Now click Create  

It will now create the project and popup a window saying Project has been created and the location of it.

Click Ok

Click Finished

Your game has now been created.
***
    
------Testing a Game------  
If you want to test the rift just highlight your game under myprojects and click the ""Open Folder"" button

This is everything that was just created.    


Open the game folder

Now open the exe file named the same as the game (E.g. Rift.exe etc)

Once you run the window just hit play and select your room

Either ""Empty Room"" or ""Empty Terrain"" (Choose Terrain to test the rift)

Click Go

It will now go Full screen and you can use the rift.

If you want to start making the game you have to get out of Full screen mode.

Press Alt + Enter to go to window mode.

Then F11 will bring you to the world editor or F10 to the Menu Editor

Please do note that water doesn't seem to be working correctly currently.

I would like to thank the below people on the Torque3D forums helping me get the rift working for myself and special thanks to David for the Rift Template.

David Wyand of Gnometech Inc.
Michael Hall of Big Kid Games
Scott Burns of GarageGames

I hope everyone enjoys this and can make some fantastic demo's and games :)

1368982617.0,28,self.oculus,1emz39,Stereo 3D and positional+rotational (6DOF) Tracking in Dirt3,32,4,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1emz39/stereo_3d_and_positionalrotational_6dof_tracking/,"Since not everyone here frequents MTBS3D I thought I'd crosspost my recent work on Dirt3 gameplay here!

With Virieo Pereption, a Razer Hydra, and the OpenTrack utility you can now play Dirt3(and other EGO games, and other games that support it in TrackIR like FSX) with 6DOF head tracking in the Rift.


For the stereo part I used the following configuration in Virieo:  
&lt;profile game_name=""DiRT 3"" game_exe=""dirt3_game.exe"" game_type=""601"" separation=""0.00344"" convergence=""5.5236"" swap_eyes=""false"" yaw_multiplier=""25"" pitch_multiplier=""25"" roll_multiplier=""1"" /&gt;
&lt;profile game_name=""DiRT 3"" game_exe=""dirt3.exe"" game_type=""601"" separation=""0.00344"" convergence=""5.5236"" swap_eyes=""false"" yaw_multiplier=""25"" pitch_multiplier=""25"" roll_multiplier=""1"" /&gt;  
 
&lt;EDIT&gt;: An important part I forgot!:
Sorry I missed a quite important step because I completely forgot I'd done it ages ago. Virieo only works on dx9 games, so you need to force Dirt3 into dx9 mode. This is done with the settings file in ""My Documents/my games/DiRT[2,3]/hardwaresettings/hardware_settings_config.xml""

There is an entry for dx9_force = false (or something like that) set it to true and things should work. Also make sure in the in game settings that the resolution is 1280x800 and shadows are set to very low.
&lt;/EDIT&gt;


Virieo should be set to Oculus Rift, but with No Tracking.

You should also set the FOV to 90 degrees with the Dirt3 FOV changer available here http://www.nogripracing.com/forum/showthread.php?p=1627851 (it works an all EGO games)

The head tracking comes from OpenTrack (FTNoIR fork) where I previously had rotational tracking with the following download:  
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15205095/opentrack.zip (for those without a hydra)  
and now supports using the hydra in the headstrap for positional tracking:  
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15205095/opentrack_hydra.zip

Now lets get you jumped straight into a game!

Extract and launch OpenTrack (opentrack.exe), have the Rift facing forwards and press Start.
Take a hydra controller off the base, and see if the position values change, if not put it back on the base and try the other controller. If neither does anything try pressing a button on a controller and repeat.  
Now take the active hydra controller and strap it into the top strap of the Rift.

You'll notice if you go into the Hotkeys menu that I have centre bound to the 'end' key, you can change this to whatever you prefer.

Now put on your Rift (with hydra controller), press the centre hotkey (end) and you're good to go.

Launch your game and if you notice the tracking is a bit funny just press the centre hotkey again, it'll pick it up even in game. Dirt head tracking only works in the cockpit view.

WARNING: Dirt3 has a limited range of movement, small head movements are fine, but they don't let you move the head very far, rotational tracking is quite far left and right and up, but not very far down for some reason. Trying to look where the game won't let you is a good way to make yourself sick. Also I don't account for the fact that the Hydra isn't in the centre of your skull yet, so its positional tracking is exaggerated a bit when you roll your head.


A badly driven video is currently being processed for youtube, I know it's not the best place for Rift vids because of the aspect ratio problem, so I'll put it somewhere else too once this is done (Vimeo?).

**Headlining Changes:**

* My Rift arrived! So I've gone through and adjusted all the default tracking sensitivities to hopefully give 1:1 tracking as long as games are configured as per [the documentation](https://github.com/ChrisJD/HMD-Stereoificator/wiki/Game-Configuration).
* Also tracking related, the dead zone if moving slowly is gone and really fast movement is no longer ignored.
* Fixed a lot of shadow/lighting issues in L4D 1/2.
* Borderlands 1 and 2 HUDs and menus are now (mostly) usable.
* Experimental support for forcing games to display on the Rift. This is disabled by default as it needs some work to make it a bit more user friendly.

I recently converted my regular desk into a stand-up desk.  I've wanted one for years, but they are very expensive - generally $800 or more.  However, after recently finding this guide:

http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html

I now have a stand-up desk!  It looks great, and is completely solid.  Only $22 and less than 10 minutes of assembly.  [Not only is it healthier than sitting](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22971879), it GREATLY adds to the Rift's immersion level! Standing really creates a sense of connection with your virtual character (especially if the game renders your character's body.) It's fun stepping around in a 360 circle in-game.  It's also much, much easier to look down to see over cliffs or large drops.  Highly recommended!    

**Edit:** Some more tips if you're serious about converting to a stand-up!

Buy this if you have hardwood floors, or are experiencing foot fatigue after standing for long periods of time.  Totally solved some soreness I was having with my feet:

http://www.amazon.com/Genuine-Anti-Fatigue-Beveled-3-Feet-Black/dp/B000EFK9KM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374845873&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=anti+fatigue+mat

I also recommend buying a stool, to use for those times where you just don't want to stand. Sticking with the IKEA theme, this one has a back and is the right height for most:

1374641445.0,27,self.oculus,1ixqxd,Rift impressions - 2 Weeks in,33,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1ixqxd/rift_impressions_2_weeks_in/,"So, I got my Rift exactly 2 weeks ago today, and I thought its time I finally paid my dues for all the moaning I have been doing over the 9 month wait and get on with an impressions post. I never did a 'first' impressions post, which I'm going to claim was because I wanted to give a nice, developed opinion on it. It may, in reality, be because I have barely taken it off....

So without further adieu, my rift impressions after two fairly solid weeks of use:

**Day 1 - Nerdgasm and First Thoughts**

My rift actually turned up a day before I got it, but no one was home. Crushing. Carrying it home from the post office, I was surprised by how heavy it felt in my hands as a whole box. The weight of expectations maybe?

Got it home and the first demo I tried was Blue Marble. I took a few notes, kind of surprised below:

* Screen door, worse than I thought but better than I thought, really noticeable, but less of a problem than I assumed. (Side Note: This may be the fact that I have been playing console games/indie games/N64 emulators the last few years, and graphical fidelity isn't that important to me. That said, I used to be a graphic designer, so it also sort of is)
* Comfort is amazing, am I still wearing this?
* This is the coolest thing *ever*
* No, seriously, *ever*

Next up for the day were space walk, titans of space, First law and I can't even remember, but the ""I could play like this forever"" moment (the wow moment was from the first second) came with Minecrift. Great sense of scale, really cool to be in a world I have already played in so much, and the screen door effect was less noticeable.

**Day 14 - 2 weeks on, still...*ever***

So, I had a really enthusiastic first day, but what about 2 weeks later? Well, my most played Rift games are War Thunder and Minecraft, the former fulfilling my inner 7 year old's fantasy of being an ace fighter pilot, and the latter fulfilling my current fantasy of living in a world where reward is proportional to effort...with cubes.

Impressions of the device now?

* Screen door effect is barely noticeable. There if you focus on it, but so are the pixels on your 20""+ HD monitor. Hell, I can see the pixels on my monitor now without even leaning in...still, I cant wait for higher res, because at the moment fine detail is blurry, and that limits what you can do game play wise. Last time I played a flight sim, developers would not have dreamed of having animated, textured, 3d flight instrumentation, but it's all there in War Thunder, you just can't read the numbers...yet.
* It's still super light. I'm also impressed by how easy it is to take off/put on, especially if no-one else adjusts it in the mean time.
* I didn't know it, but it turns out I am slightly short sighted. Was using the A cups on day 1 but switched to the B's on day 2 to demo to my girlfriend and they were much clearer.
* On that note, my Girlfriends actual IPD is 54.5, just out of the range for the rift. Demo's that allow changing the IPD down to 55mm work fine for her, but anything at standard settings makes her sick *really* quickly. Also, it takes about 10-15 times as long (no joke) for her to find the ""sweet spot"" where it is clear in both eyes as it does for me (IPD 65mm)
* I watched all of SAO and Accell world over the last 3 days, VRMMORPG, PLEASE!

Well, that's basically it, happy to answer any questions, especially if you made it through what I assume is a nightmare of rambling text up there. Thanks for reading.",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1ixqxd,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1ixqxd/rift_impressions_2_weeks_in/,

Just thought I'd share my first attempt at making an interactive Oculus Rift demo.

This app dumps you into the middle of a low resolution beach asset (found while clicking randomly through Google) where you can view a bikini-clad Hatsune Miku and Rin Kagamine dancing and singing to Colorful Melody. (It's Summer after all)

I was getting tired of waiting for someone to develop an Oculus Rift demo that featured more than one Vocaloid character so I decided to do it myself.

Don't expect much -- I literally just started using Unity and MMD no more than a week ago.  I'm still learning as I go. ;_;


I slapped this together over the course of the entire day thanks to the MMD-to-unity plugin mentioned here:

https://github.com/GOROman/OculusRift/wiki/Oculus-Rift-MMD

and all of the publically free MMD and art assets you can find online through bowlroll, Nicovideo, Youtube, Deviantart, etc. (I take zero credit for any of the art and music assets used here)

I realize the legs are screwed up -- I have absolutely no idea how to fix them, but someone linked me to a PDF guide several days ago detailing how to import more stable MMD models, so I'm gonna have a go at that this upcoming weekend to see if that fixes the animation quality.

1373637802.0,25,self.oculus,1i5iki,The Final Barrier (article),29,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1i5iki/the_final_barrier_article/,"(Copied from my post on the Oculus Rift forums: https://developer.oculusvr.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=2559 )

WHEN I was a kid, I lived and breathed video games. Not just the games, I had a love affair for the hardware these games run on, as constrained by technology as they were. As a Generation X'er, I grew up just as the fledgling Consumer Computer industry found its feet, so was exposed to some outstanding, significant silicon: Spectrum, Atari ST, Amiga. Every game was good, every last one offered something worthwhile, new, and - most importantly - they were fun.

My brother and I would often compete against each other for hours on end in racing sims such as Geoff Crammond's seminal *F1 Grand Prix*, or *Micro Machines*, or any number of amazing titles over the years. I loved the fact that with some booksmarts and a bit of perseverance, you could even use these early computers to write your own games too. As a young adult I even managed to work in the video games industry for a time, a period of my life I look back on fondly.

But despite it all, as I grew older, I found myself playing games less and less. I'm 38 now, but by about the time I was in my early twenties, the rot had already started to sink in: I was devoting less time to gaming, despite not having any responsibilities past the obligatory job and a few bills. As a (self-professed) long-standing hard-core gamer, this realization caused me some frustration. The good games were still out there, but they were getting harder to find, and there seemed to be more and more average-to-bad titles compared to those old, carefree, rose-tinted days. Fast forward to 2013, and my PS3 is slowly gathering dust in the corner.

I've long wondered why that is. I've posited several reasons to myself. Growing older, for a start: it's true that people move on, priorities change, and sometimes life just gets in the way. But that didn't explain why I still considered myself an avid hardcore gamer, despite only playing perhaps two to three titles a year. The love never really went away, so what else could it be?

It's equally true that the Games Industry has changed beyond all recognition since those carefree days of the bedroom coder. With the possible exception of a handful of Indie games, anything made in the last twenty years would have required a small army of coders, artists and musicians. Some of the games EA and others have been putting out recently have such obscene budgets as to put most mainstream triple-A Hollywood blockbusters to shame. The return on investment required on a $100 Million title is obscene: *Homefront* sold three million units, and there are some in the industry that point to this 'failure' as the reason for THQ's demise. With so much at stake, it's not surprising that the vast majority of new games are the same clones and endless sequels of games that I've played countless times for the last umpteen years. Maybe familiarity breeds contempt?

That wasn't it, either. I can hand-on-heart say the absolute best games I've ever played have been hosted on modern silicon, and some of them were sequels too. *Half-Life 2* I've replayed so many times I'm scared I'll wear out the CD (or at least I would, where it not hosted on Steam). *Portal 1 &amp; 2* frustrated and amazed me in equal measure with its beautiful puzzles and hilarious one liners. I absolutely can't wait to get my hands on *The Last Of Us*, the new *Tomb Raider* and *Destiny*, amongst others.

Some decry the lack of innovation in the hardware industry: the PS3 is broadly similar to the PS2 which is broadly similar to the original PlayStation; each is merely more powerful than the last. It wasn't until Nintendo started innovating with unusual control mechanisms with the Wii that Microsoft and Sony started to even think about alternate ways to control the on-screen action. But even then, what we have from the big three is largely gimmicky and ultimately forgettable. So I can't even pin it on apathy.

Over the years I hadn't really been able to put my finger on the root cause. So I ambled along, playing the odd game here and there (well, mainly waiting for *Half-Life 3* if I'm being honest). And then some American kid in his Dad's garage duct-taped some smartphone components to a ski mask and accidentally invented The Future. Or the past, more accurately: Virtual Reality as a concept had been in the public lexicon for nigh on twenty years; it was a concept that had over promised and under delivered year after year. After a brief dabble with some horrendously expensive kit in the early nineties, VR was quickly and quietly forgotten. And rightly so, too - the technologies necessary for a fully immersive experience at a reasonable price point simply didn't exist back then. High-resolution, thin LCD screens, near-instant motion tracking sensors and hugely fast CPU/GPU's have only really been available since the rise of the smartphone, which commoditised and brought economies of scale to many of these components that Palmer Luckey put to such effective use with his home-grown lashups.

It was when I saw Luckey's slick Kickstarter campaign last year that the penny finally dropped. *That* was what was missing, the reason why I didn't connect to videogames like I did as a youngster. For years I'd seen gaming make enormous strides, from eight-colour blocky graphics to sixteen-colour sprites to rudimentary 3D wireframe graphics to fully texture-mapped worlds, all facilitated by the incessant march of Moore's law. To a certain extent my younger self had filled in the gaps in those early crude games with my imagination, but there came a point where everything that needed to be presented in the game was on-screen - more or less - in full technicolour 3D with surround sound audio. Only the Final Barrier between the player and the gameworld remained, and only VR could possibly hope to smash through that.

Luckey's description of the Oculus Rift on Kickstarter was one of those 'Why the Hell didn't I think of that?' moments. At very little cost he'd taken some off-the-shelf, readily available components and accomplished what several large Corporations had resolutely failed to do for two decades, and they'd had one hell of a head start on Luckey: those very early VR experiments by Virtuality et al predated his birth. The most annoying thing was that what Luckey had accomplished could have been realized by anyone at any point in the last five years or so. Possibly the only reason he hadn't conceived of the Rift sooner was just due to his sheer youth: it's hard to change the World when you're still studying at School.

I, like a lot of veteran gamers, have been waiting for VR for what feels like forever. As a concept it looked like it had been killed off for good until the Rift started blowing minds at the 2012 E3 onwards. It was a bizarre sight to see the combined reveals of two next-gen Consoles earlier this year be totally overshadowed by a peripheral. The Oculus team seem to be bracing themselves for competition from some big hitters, but I suspect the Corporations will take a 'wait and see' approach. Sony and Nintendo in particular have already dabbled with the technology and got nowhere with it: any possible competition will likely come from a small outfit largely copying what Luckey and co. have been doing for the last couple of years. But with the headstart and the backing they have already amassed, it's looking like Oculus will dominate the first of the modern generation of VR headsets, at least.

Oculus are going to be the Atari of their day, back when Atari owned the entire video games industry in the early 80's. It was poor content that did for Atari back then, and the team at Oculus are painfully aware of their History and have spent almost as much resources developing a robust SDK and getting the great and the good of the games industry on board as they have developing and building the Rift hardware itself. This bodes well. There are still many things the team have to resolve before the Consumer Rift launches, from adjustable optics to positional headtracking to the thorny issue of nausea to varying degrees, but with the funding in place and a large number of obscenely talented engineers hired, I'd be shocked if V1.0 of the Oculus Rift proper wasn't an absolutely mind-blowing, game-changing experience.

It was a long and rocky road, but it appears VR's time has finally come, and by all accounts it's been worth the wait.

Life is short so live it up.

At first I got ""no sensor detected"" errors, turns out the USB cable that came with the rift was busted. Once I got the good cable on it started working immediately. Here is what I think...

1. The immersion is like nothing I've ever experienced. This is no doubt where the future of gaming is going. If the consoles don't pony up, they're going to be left behind.

2. Screen door: this was a non issue. It's an early version, it'll get better and to be honest the immersion is so amazing you don't notice it.

3. Field of view: I slightly see the outline of the lenses but it really does feel like you're in there. 

4. Motion sickness: I never get motion sick but to be honest I'm a little green after my first rift experience. This got better the more I used it.

So finally, after nearly a year of waiting, yesterday my dev kit has arrived! Totally unexpected, as the last email I got was about 2-3 weeks ago and it went to processing. Oculus kept silent since then.

Either way, I own Sony HMZ-T1, and Razer Hydra. I downloaded several demos to try them on my Rift.
First one was Tuscany demo with Hydra. You've seen it so many times, and so did I, but this time, when on the rift you could really feel like you are inside that house. Sense of scale, freedom of moving your hands around... Super. But get's kinda boring soon after - it's a tech demo after all.

I have my display as close as it is possible to the eyes, so my FOV is covering pretty much everything I can see. That's really cool. Screen door is noticable, but because of butter smooth headtracking, you will ignore it and just go on with the experience. But this is the future! Sony HMZ-T1 has brilliant image quality due 2 720p OLED screens, but FOV is really small compared to Rift. If Oculus will manage to go even beyond 1080p, it is going to be a game changer.

Next demo - Zombies on the holodeck. There are some calibration issues, but holey moley, this is the kind of game I wanna play. You have to use your hands to reach to your pistol, you have to hold the shotgun using both hands... It's really cool. And you can really feel when zombies are coming closer to you due to outstanding 3D effect.

Aurora Borealis - just a tech demo. You can look around the sky and see some nice effects. Turned it off after 30 seconds, as it's really low-res and 2D.

RiftCoaster - fun for first time and that's it. I never ever got motion sick, and I even took the whole ride facing backwards :D So motion sick is a myth to me ;)

VR Cinema - really cool concept, but due to low res not really usable yet.

Qbeh - really short demo but really fun to play. Ability to look around is stunning - this is the kind of game that will be perfect to adopt to VR.

HL2/TF2/Portal - it's looking really nice, but playing with the controller is not the best option. I know that there is a HL2VR mod where you can use Hydra, but then 3D is not so good and there are many bugs.

Doom 3 BFG - kinda scary, and aiming with your head is actually pretty good.

TLDR: I was using the Rift 85% of the time standing on my legs. I never got motion sick. The screen door does exist, but because of immersion, you won't notice it unless you look for it. Rift is a game changer. Looking forward for UHD and more content!

Here is a [video](http://youtu.be/HCoaavYsJdk?t=1m40s) that shows how the game looks from the cockpit view. The helmet is optional though. 

Here's some unedited in game screenshots that I've taken over the past year on the PC with ultra dx11 details and 4K resolution:

Here's some more screenshots as well taken by members of the community:

As you can see the challenge will be to get a high enough fps with these visuals on the rift! Racing games are perfect for the rift though and I personally cannot wait to play the game with the rift. Here's a few more videos made by members of the community using all in game footage as well:

Here’s an update to my Hydra/Rift/Unity3D Demo. It’s starting to move a bit more in the worldbuilding type direction, but there’s a ways to go yet! so far you can pretty much move/copy/rotate/delete/toggle gravity most things in the scene. It makes for some interesting play and perspectives while you swing a 300’ piece of metal around like it’s nothing!

Also! Accidental Magic Carpet rides!

Grab one of the movable platforms (OR THE SILVER SURFER BOARD)

hold it near the front, and ‘walk’ onto it

moving your hand up/down will control the ‘hover’ height of the carpet..

walking while hovering will thrust you in that direction (you can hold left trigger also for speed boost

turning works too.. It’s pretty neat, but that can get a bit disorienting if you haven’t figured out how to scale back your focus yet.

Configuration oddities.
Start with the hydra docked, and the rift facing the same direction as the hydra
pick up the controllers, move them to roughly where you want the hands to be connected (I like to just attach while my physical hands are nearly IN my torso, just to have the virtual hand models further away from the virtual body... feels nicer.
click the ‘start’ buttons on the hydra.

1373239480.0,24,self.oculus,1htun2,(Yet another post) Rift first impressions - Trying to give some new info here.,36,12,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1htun2/yet_another_post_rift_first_impressions_trying_to/,"Here is another Rift review for you.  I’ve had mine for a few days now.  Hopefully I can tell you something new here.  My setup is as follows:

* NVidia GeForce 690 video card
* Windows 7
* Oculus Rift Dev Kit
* Razor Hydra
* Microsoft Xbox 360 controller
* KB, Mouse
* 30"" Dell monitor 2560x1600
* Generally high-end PC in every way

**Installation**

Installation went pretty easy for the rift.  My computer had 3 Dual link DVI video out ports on the back, so I just plugged my monitor into one, and the Rift into another.  At first, I was unable to get the rift to recognize the video, but then realized that the 2560x1600 signal was too much for it.  So, I set my primary monitor to 1920x1080, then pressed WINDOWS+P to get the Multi-monitor setup, and choose ""Duplicate"".

Installation for the Hydra was done months earlier.  It was awkward to install, but eventually through the help of Reddit and such managed to get the right software in the right place.  Until I had the Rift, I was quite disappointed with the Hydra.  It was ""okay"", but too much hassle.  With the Rift, it's a slightly different story (more on that later.)

**Initial Impressions**

The first thing I tried was [Cartoon World Demo](http://www.riftenabled.com/admin/app/179), which is a pretty decent demo to start with.  

When I first plugged in the Rift I was disappointed.   I was prepared for the ""screen door"", and it was exactly what I expected.  I was also prepared for the ""motion blur"", but that was less than I expected.  What I was not prepared for was the ""goggle"" effect, where you don't really get a full view.  There was very strong black border around.  I was expecting a little bit of black in the periphery, based on other Redditors comments, but this was significantly more than expected.  I then adjusted the lenses to be as close to my face as the Oculus would allow.  This helped a tiny bit, but it remains an issue.  (Note: The lens adjusters really need something you can grab with the rift on, like a knob or something, so you can play with them while wearing the Rift.  However, I found I can just push the rift and force the lenses closer without using the adjuster, so that's what I do.)

I then tried a bunch of demos.  As I got more used to the rift, it became more immersive.  Like others said, the screen door is not so bad once you are used to it.

The Rift is truly awesome.  Some of it I think I was expecting more, but overall I am having so much fun that what is not completely finished does not matter. 

**Things that would make the Rift better**

* Improved display:  Even if it's a 1080p display that up-converts, that would be better than screen-door.
* Head tracking: It tracks awesome as you turn your head around, but does not track if you move your body, lean over, etc.  This can be fudged by using the Hydra (see below), but I hope to see this someday built in.
* Better eye adjusters - The eye adjuster thingies work by inserting a coin, but they need to be a knob.
* You can see through the air vents below.  Not a big deal, and a dark room makes it go away, but I would like to see my virtual feet down there :)
* Comfort: The Rift is plenty comfortable for me.  The adjustment straps are pretty good, but I would like a way to adjust them faster between people.  I'm not sure if it can be made better than it is, though, as it is pretty good.
* I can imagine it would be nice to have surround-sound headphones integrated, just to avoid the extra cables.  My setup is now a cable nightmare, and I don't even use my headphones because that's just over the top spaghetti.
* I would like it if the Rift could import higher resolution displays to down-convert.  That way, I don't need to mess with my resolution settings, since 2560x1600 is unsupported as it is.

**Hydra Integration**

If you have a Hydra, you have got to try [Heli-Hell]( http://www.riftenabled.com/admin/app/13).  You don't need the Hydra to enjoy this demo, but if you have the Hydra, you can drop one of the sticks down your shirt, and it becomes a body tracker.  This allows you to lean your body outside the Helicopter, and it really enables the emersion.  This is the first time that I was like, ""Wow!  Glad I bought the Hydra!"".   The demo is not very big, so the fun does not last forever, but it's really cool.   This demo is best played with RIFT+360 Controller+Hydra.   Note that you need to click on the menu items to enable the 360 joystick, and once you do the left trigger button is ""Up"", the right is ""Down"", and the joystick is to navigate.  It's easy to navigate once you know this magic.  [Cymatic Bruce does a great review of this setup here]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HngrXgDS5Ws).  I was never able to get my regular ""Wingman Attack 2"" joystick to work with this demo, perhaps because it is ancient.

Note: Hydra + Rift = big tangle of cables.  I can't wait for this to be wireless (at least the Hydra part).  I guess Sixsense has this in the works.

**Half Life 2**

To install Half life 2 for the Rift, you need to right-click on the shortcut in steam, and then enable the beta downloads.  Once you have done that and the updates have downloaded, you right-click on the shortcut to change the launch option to include the -vr switch.

Half life 2 is the best VR full-game I have found so far.   I found kb+mouse to work great with it.  Use the rift to move your head, and the mouse to aim.  Move the mouse extra far to turn your body.  This seems to work okay.  

**Performance**

With the GeForce 690 I have found I can run any of the demos and games at 1920x1080 with pretty much everything else maxed out.  HL2 had some lag, so probably reducing some of the settings is a good idea.  I have not fine-tuned it yet.

One issue I did have with HL2 was a stutter where it would move smooth for a full second, and then stutter, then repeat this over and over.  Extremely annoying.  The fix was to disable Vsync, which as far as I can tell is not needed anyways.

**Rift Sickness**

I ride in airplanes a lot, and went to flight school.  I commute to work by boat.  I do not get sea sick.   What people say about the Rift is True - it will make you sick.  Some of the demos are not so bad, but some will make you sick.  As I write this, I have been out of the rift for a good hour, but I still feel it.   It's sort of that same nausea you might experience if you try reading in the car and never look out the window.  

One other thing about this is that it appears to ""linger"" after using the Rift.  I can feel the muscles in my eyes drifting around as I try to adjust back to ""real life"" for a good solid hour.  Note, though, that I had this same issue after watching Avatar in the IMAX in 3D., while others reported no such issue.  So, that might just be me, or a certain subset of the population.

**IPD**

Some of the games appear to have IPD (Inter Pupillary Distance) adjustments, but they are hidden away.  I think Unity based demos have +/- keyboard keys to adjust it.  I played with this a little, but noticed that it seemed to not matter.  Perhaps I will revisit this at a later date, since I have the values already measured by my Optomitrist.

**The Demos**

First off, RiftEnabled.com has [a great list of demos, that you can sort by rating.](http://www.riftenabled.com/admin/apps/).  There is a link to this in the reddit side-bar.

The Rift Coaster is a must have.  The feeling of space and height is very good, but it is not perfect.  I would be much more scared of the heights in real life than when on the Rift.  Still, it's a great demo, and one anyone should have in their arsenal.

Blue Marble is nice, and an easy one for folks spooked by VR to ease into without getting sick.

Rift Racer is a lot of fun.  This one will make you sick.  Almost guaranteed.

Proton Pulse is like 3D pong where you move the paddle with your head.  My wife, who has no patience for games normally, really liked this one, and played quite a long time without getting sick. 

Delta Draconis is a nice ""fly over terrain"" demo. 

Arch Virtual is a good ""see what your new house will look like"" architectural demo.  It's very simple, but when I do my remodel someday, I'll want these guys to help with the visualizations.

I have not yet tried Vireio Perception or VorpX drivers or similar to enable any games.  So far, I've limited myself to things that more officially support the Rift.

Youtube videos can sometimes be watched through the rift by just going full-screen.  This is a nice way to view some of the demos that you might not want to bother to install.

**Conclusions**

The Rift really is awesome.  For those who are on the fence of buying a Dev Kit, I would have to say that it is definitely worth it if you don't mind having to do a lot of configuration to get games to work, and the limited selection of demos.  I am super-glad I bought it, even though it was a 9 month wait from hell.

When they release this as the consumer version, I expect it will do extremely well.  The next version is going to be better, and that, to me, is probably the most exciting thing on the planet.

**Additional edits and afterthoughts** (I'll post more stuff here as I think of it.)

* If you stand up in games and demos where one would be standing in the game, the immersion is quite a bit better.  There is something subconscious here, but standing up really makes a difference.  
* I've also played around with ""Jumping"" in real life when jumping in a game.  It is kind of weird.  Would be nice if there was some positional tracking to pick that up automatically.  The demo ""COZ Alpha Playground"" seems to have some fun jumping in it, as well as decent Hydra support.
* The game ""[War Thunder](http://warthunder.com/)"" is extremely awesome.  It has a ""rift"" check-box and everything.   I thought It was locked up during the tutorial, but it turns out it was just waiting for me to press a key to continue.  It is super-cool to be able to look around when flying.  Much more like a real plane!  We put a fan in front and cranked it up.  That adds some additional immersion.  My 6-year old got a big kick out of that as well.

Try the following!,28,0,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1hscgx/having_tearinglatency_issues_in_halflife_2_or/,"Just tried this with Half-Life 2 and there was a dramatic difference.  The first time I ran HL2, I just cloned screens.  Today I extended screens, and HL2 just output on the rift automatically.  HUGE difference.  No tearing, lag, etc.

From MTBS3D: http://www.mtbs3d.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=140&amp;t=18026#p135731

""Anyway, tearing or not, Joe Ludwig at Valve measured extra latency when cloning your display and said it should be avoided. If you really want to duplicate your display you should use a splitter. Pain in the ass you say? Damn right you are­.

What I do now is simply extend my desktop to the Rift.

- **For Unity games**: Select the .exe, right-click and create a shortcut. Right-click the shortcut to get the properties and add -adapter 1 to the command line. Assuming your Rift is the secondary display. It starts at 0...

- **For UE3 games**: Pressing F11 cycles the displays.

- **For Source games**: They should detect your Rift properly and launch on it.

It sucks when demoing your Rift to friends but other than that it works fine and it's hassle free. No extra latency, no tearing and you can use Windows normally on your main screen at whatever crazy resolution your monitor supports.""",,False,self,t5_2uni5,False,,,True,t3_1hscgx,http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1hscgx/having_tearinglatency_issues_in_halflife_2_or/,

First of all, I honestly did not mind the screendoor effect that much, and I found that by cranking up the anti-aliasing on most demos, I was able to get a very convincing image. However, I found the motion-blur to be almost unbearable in the beginning. Moving my head ever so slightly would instantly cause the screen to go blurry, and gave me a raging riftache. After a day of testing, the blurring is more tolerable, but still the biggest problem I see in the Rift.

Now on to the good stuff: The head tracking is essentially perfect, I detected no lag whatsoever. The 3d effect seemed underwhelming at first when I tried it on the Tuscany Demo, but that was simply due to the smallness of the map. (I would suggest Frequency Domain and Blue Marble for a good demonstration of the Rift's 3D capabilities.

Finally, It was actually the alpha demo of GoD Factory which truly sold the rift to me. After donning my Rift and blasting out of the docking station, I was completely blown away by the spacescape in front of me. This is one of the most well done natively supported rift games out there, and I would highly suggest it to anyone. The fact that your player model is a ship gives a shocking but awesome vibe to the game. Looking down, I though ""Holy Shit I'm a spaceship"" and that was the moment which made me believe in the world the Rift had created for me. This is an amazing technology, and I can't wait to see how Oculus continues to improve it.

I've been lurking on /r/oculus for some time now, mainly since I pre-ordered, which I believe will be shipping soon given the recent customs correction. (US, Texas)  Something that has been, worrying me (for lack of a better descriptor) is the over abundance of these ""Oculus + Razor + Kinect + Ham Sandwich!"" posts.  Now don't get me wrong I am just as excited to jump into the Holodeck as everyone else here but I feel we are sometimes forgetting to focus the best thing about the Oculus Rift.... the Oculus Rift.  Even with the immense support it has been given it's still a niche product that could fall into obscurity if the greater public doesn't latch on as well.  If it doesn't launch with a line up of applications and games that are astonishingly immersive and entertaining without the need for further hardware it could wither way just like any new gaming tech that doesn't have game support.  I had never even heard the Razor Hydra before reading /r/oculus and I am an avid gamer.  I think in our enthusiasm we are focusing on B and C before we have fully explored A.  I want to hear more about the experience of the Oculus itself.  I want more discussion about the game possibilities that push the boundaries of the Oculus's vanilla setup... Oculus + Mouse + Keyboard.  I get giddy watching videos of homebrew Holodecks employing every bit of game tech one can attach to their bodies but the average consumer barely wants to stand up from the couch to play a Kinect game let alone wear special shoes and run on a slippery plate.

I understand that this is more of a pet peeve than anything and I am by no means trying to discourage any explorations in VR.  Its just something I have noticed and thought might warrant discussion.
