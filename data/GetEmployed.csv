1371094231.0,34,self.GetEmployed,1g8txq,"Finally, after 3 years of unemployment I got a job!",38,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1g8txq/finally_after_3_years_of_unemployment_i_got_a_job/,"Well, hey there! About a week and a half ago I posted here asking for advice because I desperately needed a job. Last night I got an ""interview"" and today I got hired! I wanted to thank everyone on this sub-reddit for their support. I suppose the right thing to do now would be to tell those in the same position what I did.

I will note that this job came almost entirely out of luck. Long story short, I put an application in about a month ago and I got an interview. The interview was not originally successful but they kept my application and a month later they called me back in for a second interview... Except there wasn't really an interview this time. They didn't really ask me any questions, they just gave me a tour of the place and said they'd call me back and this morning they called me and let me know I had the job. I figure I must of impressed them in the last interview enough that they already knew they were going to hire me. 

But I did learn some things in my 3 years of unemployment. I don't have a college degree and I quit my last job without a notice. Here's a few tips I've learned along the way...

- Always have a resume and really work on making your resume perfect. Even if you don't have a degree and you're not applying for anything fancy. A resume can single handedly make you stand out from other applicants and can really allow you to focus more on your strengths then any basic application can do. Of course, still fill out the company's application as a lot of company's have policy's that you have to. Don't be afraid to drop your resume off in person!

- Don't be afraid of annoying employer's but don't actually annoy them if that makes any sense. Call them up every couple of days or so. Ask them if they had the time to look at your application. Go into the business, ask to meet the manager in person. Take the time to shake their hand, smile at them and tell them your name and that you're interested in the job. More then a few managers seemed impressed that I took the time out of my day to meet them in person.

- Cover letters are great too. Personalize one for each company you hand your resume to.

- Also follow up with a thank you note anytime you get an interview and/or the hiring manager takes the time to look at your application. It really leaves an impression that they will remember. Especially in entry level positions as most people will only take the time to fill out their application.

- Use job search sites, career builders, career networking sites, resume builders, etc. As much as possible. Even if you live in a small town like I do. Read the newspapers, talk to people, etc. You would be surprised how many more opportunities you will find by doing these things. I live in a town with a population of only 1,000 so when I applied to these sites I didn't expect much but I was actually overwhelmed by how many more applications I was filling out that I otherwise wouldn't have.

- Tell everyone that you're unemployed. This is something I didn't start doing until recently because I was embarrassed by the fact that I had been unemployed for so long but after some advice from a fellow redditor I started telling everyone that I was looking for work. Networking goes a long way. As it turned out part of the reason I got the job may have been through networking. I told a friend who told a co-worker that I was ""having troubles"" getting hired for the job. That co-worker had a son that worked in the business and that son talked to a manager for me. A kind act from someone I don't even know!

Finally, the interview. I don't have a lot of tips that you probably don't already know but here's a few I've learned along the way.

- Always have questions ready to ask the interviewer. Don't say that you don't have any questions if they ask you if you have any questions and make sure that they are good questions! My go to question was ""what are a couple of things I can do to go beyond what is required out of me?"". Have a couple ready!

- Don't wear bright colors. Even if they tell you that it's okay to wear jeans and a t-shirt make sure your t-shirt doesn't have any graphics on it and your jeans don't have any holes in them. 

- Smile and make eye contact, smile and make eye contact, smile and make eye contact. Eye contact was never a problem for me but it is one of the biggest things that most candidates forget to do. Smiling on the other hand was hard for me because I have bad teeth. The fact of the matter is that you want your interviewer to really think you're interested. If you're not smiling that sends all sorts of negative signals. So just do it, even if you don't have any teeth. 

- Be polite. Let the interviewer finish speaking before you say anything. Look interested in what they're saying! Nod your head, laugh at their jokes, say things like ""yes"", ""of course"" and ""that makes sense"" when they're explaining something to you. 

- Hands out of the pocket. Don't cross them either. Don't wear watches if you can't avoid looking down at the time every now and then. Don't even think about time. Don't fidget with pencils or pens or anything that is easy to fiddle with. Basically, don't rush the interviewer. Just stay calm and know that if you're there for awhile the interview is probably going good anyway.

- When asked why you quit your last job don't give them an overly detailed explanation. Overly explaining why you quit your last job sends the signal that you're not over it. And don't brag about your last job either! My last interview was weird in the sense that I interviewed with another person. The interview as stated before had absolutely no questions but the other person decided to keep bragging about his last job at the cheese farm. Whenever the interviewer said something he'd reply back with something like ""well, that's different then how we did things at the cheese farm"" and ""at the cheese farm we did things this way"". He also talked a lot about how he got laid off after 20 years. Don't get me wrong, it's okay to relate your previous experience to your current job if it's positive but don't constantly talk about it. As stated before it sends the signal that you're not over it or worse, that you feel like you're too good for this company. I have no clue if that guy got the job too but I can say that the interviewer started looking annoyed after awhile by his constant bragging about his job on the cheese farm. Hell, I was annoyed by it too. Maybe that's part of the reason I got the job too despite not having to answer any questions the second time around, I looked like a better candidate simply because I wasn't bragging the whole time about my previous job. 

- Speaking of weird interviews that required me to interview with another candidate, be ready for anything and stay calm. Shake hands with everyone (even the other candidate!), smile and remain positive. Speak when you're spoken to and if they have nothing to say (like they didn't at my interview) ask questions whenever you can. Maybe point out how the bulletin board has the weather written on it and say something like ""that seems handy"". Just stay calm and remain positive.

- Don't be upset if you don't get the job. There are many reasons you probably didn't get it. Maybe the other person just had a college degree and you didn't. Just move on and keep looking. In fact, keep looking even after the interview. Just in case you don't get a call back (make sure you call them after a few days if you didn't get a call back though).

That's about all I got. I could probably give you more tips from my experiences but that's a little bit that I learned from 3 years of unemployement.

1339624096.0,33,self.GetEmployed,v0ji3,Personal tips to help when you are not working so your life does not fall apart. Part 1,41,8,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/v0ji3/personal_tips_to_help_when_you_are_not_working_so/,"These are some personal life tips that I wanted to share that I thought might help those who find themselves out of work and looking. 

Part 1

- Get up early and start your day at 6:00 a.m., 7:00a.m. or 8:a.m. Be showered, dressed and ready to get started no later then 9:00 every single day. 

Whether its being on the computer, working on your resume, studying new material, making contacts or networking it is vital to start the day as early as possible and stick to this routine. Do not stay up late on Reddit, Youtube, Facebook or game until the early morning hours. Even if you have family or kids do your best to go to bed at a decent hour hopefully before midnight and wake up as early as you can while still getting enough rest. 

It is very easy to fall into a routine where you go to bed later and later. It creeps into your life and the next thing you know you are going to bed at 5:00 a.m. and waking up at 12:00 p.m. or later. If this starts to happen and becomes a habit it is almost impossible to get out of so for your sake do not get into this routine. If you are then force yourself to stay up all night and the next day then crash early and wake up as early as possible to break that cycle. Disorder and dysfunction have a tendency to pile up and create chaos in other areas of your life. 

- Clean up your place and do everything you can to keep it clean on a regular basis. I cannot stress this enough. A clean and orderly place is vital to a successful and productive state of mind. If you have a tendency to not make the bed put in effort to make sure every morning your bed is done. If you throw your clothes on the floor take the extra time every time you undress to put your clothes in your clothes hamper or wherever they can be out of sight. You are not working so there is no excuse as to why your kitchen or bathroom are not clean and why shit is all over the place. Try your best not to eat in front of the computer or have a bunch of shit scattered around your desk. Clean up all the junk and put it away. Clear your desk off everything. Leave only the bare necessities you need to either look for work or for whatever other hobby or work you do. Anything extra needs to be organized and put away. 

Waking up every morning to a clean place is an amazing and refreshing experience and goes a long way to a positive and productive state of mind. Do not think that is unimportant. 

Order is one of the most important principles to success. disorganization is like bacteria has a tendency to spread quickly and exponentially. One day everything is nice and next thing you know your place is a disaster and you are stressing and it looks like a lost cause. If you have reached this point get a maid, pay her the 50-100 bucks and get your place cleaned or call some of your girlfriends if you have any for an intervention to get your place ""female friendly"". A clean home is of vital importance regardless of whether you are single, married or with kids. If they can't pick up after themselves then it falls on you to do it. You are home you have the time. Do not make excuses. 

- Get rid of any extra shit you do not need or have not used in the last 6-8 months. Donate everything to GoodWill or some local church or other charitable organization if you can. If its a big ticket item or worth your time and money sell it on Craigslist or to someone you know. if it is old electronics find the nearest recycling center. 

Now that you are not working you have an opportunity to do some spring cleaning. Go through your closet and get rid of all the clothes you have not worn in a year or stuff you know you don't like anymore but are keeping them ""just in case"". 

Get rid of any old books that are lying around, any hobbies you haven't done and probably will not get to, any collectibles you don't need and anything that is lying around that you no longer use or when its all said and done is just cluttering our life. Who knows you might have to move out of state or to a new city if the right offer comes along so it might be important to reduce the crap you have around you. The simpler your life is now the better its going to be for you if you have to make tough decisions like having to move out due to lack of funds or having to move across state or city lines for the right job or right opportunity. 

- (*applicable if you are a gamer). If you are a gamer and if you have a large gaming collection go through it and get rid of most of that shit. Keep 10-20% of the best games you have and ditch the rest. Keep maybe 10 games. you don't need all of them. They don't have value. Games are some of the things that hold the least amount of value and its only perceived  value that you place on them that makes them worth anything.  Trade it in or better yet give it to GoodWill.  The ideal situation is to get rid of your xbox or playstation and the games or box them up so they are out of sight and out of mind. Most people do not realize how much time they give up by gaming daily on their consoles or on the computer. Giving this shit up is not easy to do. For it to work it has to be replaced with a different habit like going outside every day during those same hours that you would be gaming and doing something or writing or reading a book instead. Once you stop gaming you will realize how much more time you have to get shit done. The key is that you cannot just deprive yourself of that habit or any habit without replacing it with a better alternative or you will just go out and buy back all the same stuff you got rid off. having a replacement habit ready or a goal is vital to this case. If you love to game and have no intention of cutting yourself off completely at least consider limiting what you have to a small amount. There is no such thing as a backlog that you will eventually get to. You will never play all those games and you will never get to them. All that choice and backloggery just adds stress and paralyzes you. People go and create manageable lists of how they will beat their games instead of worrying about how to make more money or how to improve the life of their family. Its crazy and you need to take that shit under control.  

if you play MMOs either cancel your subscription or keep away form over playing and be aware of your marathon sessions. Do not stay up all night doing raids or playing all the MMOs you didn't get to before. Play responsibly and limit yourself. As noted above do not get into a habit of staying up late and not focusing on what you need to do. Do not let entertainment rule your life at this point as this is very dangerous when unemployed. 

- Refrain from ""data consumption"" on the internet. This includes sitting all day on Reddit, watching funny Youtube videos, reading Pinterest, being on gaming forums, self help forums, why am I forever alone, and being on TMZ and reading other useless shit. Do not just consume knowledge and data all day long.  Be a person who can apply what he has learned instead of just taking in facts and figures. Time flies when you are on the Internet and its easy to loose an entire day, week and even month surfing the web and getting sucked into the interweb nether regions. Be aware of how much time you spend on the internet and for what purpose. If you can keep track of what you did when.

I dropped out of sixth form when I was 17 and haven't done a thing since. I was (and am) very depressed but feel that I'm finally ready to get my life back on track. I'm currently 20, living in the UK. There are problems hindering my progress, though. I think it would be easiest if I wrote them up as bullet points:

* No education (don't even remember what GCSEs I have, but I know I had ≤ 5 A*-Cs with a D in maths).
* Haven't worked a day in my life.
* No marketable skills whatsoever (barely numerate).
* No formal clothing (due to a lack of funds I can't afford much -- I've got to buy a new pair of shoes today but that's pretty much the month's money gone).
* No social skills (social anxiety; I simply don't know how to talk to people).

I'm not getting any kind of help right now (no therapy/prescriptions/etc.). I live with my parents and spend all of my spare time indoors, only leaving the house to go to the Jobcentre. I *should* have spent these past few years of solitude studying -- working on my maths and learning new skills -- but, due to depression, I wasn't able to get the motivation to do so.

So, I need to know where to get started, as I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. I know that I need to create a CV despite having nothing to put on it. I've come to understand that someone like me typically aims to get a McJob, but I don't know if I have the social skills to work so closely with other people. I'm now too old to look for apprenticeships as companies get paid much less for taking on people aged 20-25, meaning they're all looking for 16-to-19-year-olds.

*Any* help is truly appreciated! Apologies if this post contains too much whining.

Here's some advice on how I got my new job.",33,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/xu5e9/if_youre_going_for_a_creative_job_dont_hold_back/,"Hi. Thought I would offer what I learned over the past few months. I had been searching for a new job for a long time, and when I saw one that looked good, I didn't apply right away. I took some time to research the company to get an idea of what they were about, and decided that it would be a perfect fit. 

We all know a generic cover letter will get you no where. I decided to step it up a notch and make them a [cover video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwSevSxdaSg) to go along with my letter. It was informative, kind of strange, but more importantly it talked about why I would be a good fit. 

I landed an interview, and it went well. Afterwards, instead of making a traditional thank you letter, I made them [another video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PsN7xf46N8) They loved it, and a week later I was hired. 

I was so nervous about giving them videos. I had never done anything like it before, and in my own opinion they probably could have been better. Guess what? None of that mattered. They saw who I was through them, and it paid off. I guess my point is, if you're going after something, don't be afraid to take a risk. If you can make or do something that will get someone's attention while showing your creativity and dedication, it's a risk worth taking.

All I've got is a few illegal jobs (as in, without a contract) and a couple internships that were completely useless. All I got from those jobs is pretty much nothing in terms of money or experience. Add a severe case of slacking on my behalf to that (yeah, I'll admit I haven't really tried at all) and what you get is a 30 y/o deadbeat still living with parents.

I'm ready to redeem myself. So, basically, I have to start anew somewhere.

For a series of reasons, I want to leave my country (Italy) and move somewhere else, possibily some place where English is the main language, as it's the only language I know besides my mother tongue. Staying in Europe would be easier since there's no immigration limits anymore, but I wouldn't mind trying somewhere else, as long as people there speak English.

I have a few uncertified, self-trained skills to bring to the table, but I'm not sure how interesting could they be to any potential recruiter. Besides my degree, I know two languages, I'm a proficient user of graphic design software, a decent writer/translator, handy with all things computer, I know some basic programming.

Would it be a good idea to apply for an internship or junior position in some foreign country and start like that? Or would you recommend some other course of action, since I'm an ""adult"" and not some fresh young graduate?

Here are some tips that helped me in my search and gave me bigger opportunities when looking for work. 

1 Look up temp agencys and consulting companies in your area. Make sure you get with as many as possible. DO NOT just go with one and hope they find you a job, they wont. Maximize your efforts to get work. Plus, it will give you the opportunity to interview with them and give you more practice.

2  Keep up with those agencies. Reach out to them every other week or once a month. This will let them know you are available and interested in work. It also keeps your name on their radar.

3 Put your resume on places like Monster and indeed. Your local network should have a place to. For example, in Seattle there is NorthWest Source. Put your resume on there and apply for jobs.

4 Don't be terribly picky in the jobs you take. Got an offer for a 1 month admin job? Take it! You might meet people or the agency sees how hard you work for such a low level job that they may want to hire you for something else. It happened for me and I've seen it happen in business A TON!

5 Go to any sort of job or career functions you can. You'll meet people and gain connections. It doesn't have to be job related either. I went to a community thing and met someone who I can place in a role. Go there and if someone asks what you do, don't say unemployed, instead tell them your skillset. ""What do you do?"" ""I'm a programer"" ""I'm a painter"" ""I'm a college student"" That way you won't feel embarrassed and they may know someone who knows someone.

I did these things and I haven't been unemployed for longer than 2 months over the past 3 years. Hopefully these will help you guys too!

I'm also to bring 3 professional references, I have 3, but I'm not sure what format to bring them in, just a simple printed page? Name and numbers? Name, numbers, job titles?

Any advice is appreciated.

**UPDATE:** I got the job! One thing I really focused on was [this TED talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc) about body language and how we can use it to change our minds and make us more confident. Whenever I got the chance (for instance when I was brought into the office room to wait for the interviewer) I would stand up with my hands at my hips like a disappointed parent about to scold their teenaged kid.

I researched the company a bit the night before and made sure I memorized the company's mission statement and 4 core values. It turned out I never got the chance to show that I knew these. I was a little more deadpan that I would have liked to be, but I was just overcompensating for my nervousness. /u/Chefbexter's reference set up was really helpful, I can rest easy knowing they know what times to contact my former employers, plus the reference sheet looks so professional.

One funny thing about the process was one of three trials I had to do, I had to complete two rounds of the children's game [Perfection](http://c.shld.net/rpx/i/s/i/spin/image/spin_prod_101196001). If you're not familiar with it it's a game where you have 60 seconds to place all of the assorted shapes into their corresponding slots, if the 60 seconds are up the board pops up sending them all flying. This trial was to test my attention to detail under pressure, the first round had me placing all but three pieces in before the time was up and the board popped. The second round I perfected the board with just a few seconds to spare.

Here's the situation:

3 monts ago, I got accepted to a 1 year internship at a Fortune 100 company. It's basically my dream job. I was told that if I do well, they might keep me after this 1 year period.

Here's the catch: There are 2 of us. The other guy is an outgoing, nice person. Yesterday, I got an ""unofficial"" information, that the reason why they hired 2 people for the same position is to see who's more suitable for a permanent position.

I'm afraid that won't be me. Even tough I think I'm more ""professional"" than him, his social skills are much better than mine. He was able to make friends, socialize, make connections, while I'm really poor at socializing in a new environment. I'm not an introvert, I'm just kind of shy, and I need more confidence. I also don't talk a lot. He's got a huge advantage here.

Being slightly better as a professional is not enough here. I need to improve my image as well.

1339903618.0,22,self.GetEmployed,v5yhh,Phone Tips: Leaving a voicemail,23,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/v5yhh/phone_tips_leaving_a_voicemail/,"So this is an attempt to both vent, and teach some people about how important a voicemail can be to a potential employer.

I'm in the middle of hiring 600-800 people for event security, and one of my biggest issues in the last few months has been trying to make sense of the mountain of voicemails that are being left for my staff and I. Over the course of this project, I've come up with several types of messages that I can't stand, and how to not fall into those categories.

1. Don't mumble. Please understand that when you mumble into your phone, I think two things: a) this person has no confidence whatsoever, and b) this person cannot effectively communicate. This is bad for the potential employee, as this is my first impression of them, and it's a poor impression. I've had a few hundred messages that sounded like the applicant was speaking into a wet blanket from two rooms over. Speak clearly into your phone, and if you need to, write out what you want to say first. Which brings us to...

2. Keep the message short. Don't tell your potential employer your life story. I've had several people that have left messages that take 3-4 actual voicemails for them to actually give me their phone number. One that stands out was a man that left me his ENTIRE work history in 8 voicemails. He would talk until the max length of the voicemail, call back, and continue his resume. I know that you want your potential employer to know you can perform, but that's what an interview is for. Leave your name, phone number, tell them you're interested in the position, re-state your name and phone number, then hang up.

3. Turn off your music/TV/any other noise in the background. I don't want to listen to your favorite song/TV show, and I don't need to hear you telling your kids to be quiet for half the message*. I want to hear your voice, I want to know your name and phone number. Would you bring a boombox and your kids to a job interview? No. Please keep the background noise to an absolute minimum.

4. Don't speak so fast that I can't understand you. On the opposite side of the coin from the mumbler, the speed talker is difficult to deal with, because they're so nervous that their speech rivals that of the flash as an awkward teenager asking a girl to a dance. The only way to demonstrate this in text would be ""hellothisisclarenceiwantajobmynumberis5555124689pleasecallmeiwantajobineedyoutocallmeback."" Messages like this are way too frequent, remember to breathe, and be sure of what you're going to say before you call.

5. If you've put in an application (especially online) and you call to confirm that the company received it (which you should), don't call 20 times a day, every day. I had one woman who literally called me 45 times one day and left me 17 voicemails to confirm that I had received her application. I called her the next day to confirm that I had indeed received it, and I would be calling her the following week; she continued to call me 5-10 times a day for the next week to make sure I hadn't forgotten her. I never did forget her, but I also didn't hire her.

6. If you're having trouble reaching the company/HR person, DO NOT leave a voicemail saying how angry you are that they haven't called you back. This should go without saying, but I've had several people that worked for the company that we took the contract from who called me a total of 3 times, and the last voicemail was basically them telling me how pissed they are that I haven't returned their phone calls (this was over a single day, within a 4 hour time period), and how they were going to come to my office to ""teach me a lesson in respect."" NEVER threaten a potential employer. If you need to voice concern due to how long it takes for the employer to respond to calls, do so calmly and respectfully, and everything should be fine.

7. Change your outgoing message. If you leave me a message that is clear, concise, and intelligible, and when I call you back I hear something along the lines of ""ay yo, it's ya boi D. Holla if you need some. if you a hata, then you a bitch, so get out ma fone,"" I will not be leaving a message, and will probably save your number as NEVER ANSWER. Also, don't have an outgoing message that sounds like you answering your phone (aka ""Hello? Hello? I can't hear you, you'll have to leave a message""), it's not a good way to represent yourself. Remember, this is all about perception, specifically what you want the prospective employer to think of you. Make these things count.

*If your kids are fine for most of the message, and start acting up in the middle of the message, I get it; but I've had several dozen messages that consist of kids screaming, and the applicant yelling that the kids to ""shut the hell up!""",,False,self,t5_2uagc,False,,,True,t3_v5yhh,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/v5yhh/phone_tips_leaving_a_voicemail/,

Could use some tips.,22,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1frzfa/3_years_unemployed_could_use_some_tips/,"I've been unemployed for 3 years. I'm nearly homeless as my girlfriend finally got fed up with me not having a job and kicked me out. It's not that I haven't been trying but I suppose I haven't been trying hard enough. I get discouraged sometimes and I quit looking sometimes for a couple weeks or so. But it's crucial that I get a job right now. Anything. But I think I need to fix a few things on my ""resume"".

So, here's a little background. About three years ago I made a huge mistake. I quit a full time job at Walmart simply so I could spend more time with my new girlfriend. I hated the management, so I didn't feel guilty about not putting in a two week notice. I just stopped showing up. It was a dumb, immature and selfish decision in all honesty and I realize that now. I didn't think it would take long to find a new job anyway. 

So, now there's a huge gap in my employment and that's problem #1. I don't know how to explain this. It's not like I haven't been looking. I've been looking - But probably not as hard as I should be.

Issue #2: How do I explain my reason for leaving? What should I put for my reason for leaving?

I don't have a college degree nor have I ever attended college (I'm 28 years old btw). I've been working entry level jobs my whole life and I really only have 2 employers on my application. I can't afford not to put Walmart because I worked there for 2 years. It would leave an even larger gap in my employment. The second job was as a supervisor at Subway. I worked there for 4 years and I was pretty good at my job but I wonder if that's turned into a bad reference also since when I moved here I actually went back to Subway for a couple of weeks but I had so few hours that I called them up and told them I wouldn't be showing up anymore but I don't put my second time working for Subway on my application (The first time it was in a different state).

I should mention that I live in a pretty small town. There's not many jobs here and it's really competitive but I can't afford to move. So, how do I fix these grey areas? I can't afford to be unemployed anymore. 

Also, I have really bad teeth which makes it hard for me to smile at interviews. I just know that they're going to see them and when they do they're going to think ""why should I hire this dude? Customers don't want to see that shit"".

I've read plenty of tips on this website but it seems like a lot of them are meant for people that are out of college.

Struggling to keep motivated and keep trying...,18,0,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1g1g8t/28_years_old_no_consistent_employment_since_2008/,"I can't sleep right now because I'm so stressed about my situation and can't get over the anxiety. Been subbed to this subreddit for months and haven't looked at it once. Forgive me for the incoming wall of text and I greatly appreciate anyone who manages to get through this all. Just very stressed about my situation and want to get working again asap.

Rewind to college. I went for Game Art &amp; Design and all was going well until I realized that I did not have the passion for art that is needed to excel and stand out from the crowd. It was a hard pill to swallow but I eventually swallowed it. 

Unfortunately this robbed me of my motivation and passion to succeed. I fluttered around in other majors until I was around 22 and then I got involved in a terrible, co-dependent, life-ruining relationship. Somehow I managed to land a good job doing tech support. Little did I know this would end up being the start of my second passion. It's not as great of a passion as I had for designing games, but I found I was good at it.

I had no real training and had to hit the ground running having only my experience building gaming pc's to back me up and thankfully I adapted to it. I held that job for a solid year until I just let my judgment become clouded and left the job. I had tons of stressors in my life, the main one being my terrible relationship at the time. I convinced myself the tech support environment was too stressful and THAT was the issue.  Biggest mistake I've ever made. I would KILL for another job in that field.

I thought I'd just go back to school and take it easy since I was still living at home. I'd take more classes and then get a better job. Turns out I just let myself get distracted and I never accomplished anything in school aside from getting a crap GPA. I had grown to hate school by this point.

Few more years go by and I can't get anything decent. Nothing that lasts over 3 months. 

I crafted a good resume with the help of various people and took it to a local CC job fair to have it critiqued by professionals and they all said that I really didn't have much I could add or do to it. This just frustrated me because I still couldn't land anything related to my field of choice. I'd get interviews that always lead to no where. Never an explanation as to why I'm turned down.

A few months ago a friend turned me on to this 'CompTIA Academy' that has recently begun at a local community college. It's basically a system of courses designed around achieving various CompTIA certifications which is a nice breathe of fresh air. I had already tried self-studying for my A+ and I just couldn't muster up the focus to get through it. I've finished my first quarter of classes and it felt great. Felt like the first real progress I've made with my life since I worked tech support.

However I don't want to wait until more classes are finished to find solid employment. I can't figure out why employers don't like me. I have had a lot of interviews at a lot of places and I never get another call back. I'm friendly, I'm confident, I get my interviewers to smile and laugh, and I rehearse interview questions with my gf who does interviewing for people at her company... It just makes no sense to me and it's incredibly depressing. I almost hate submitting applications because I just don't want to be rejected AGAIN without reason. I'm even getting turned down for jobs that people on the inside recommend me for. 

I really don't care how low-end the job is, as long as it's somewhere IT-related. I don't care if I have to scrub bathrooms at an IT company... as long as there's room to go up. I don't care what the pay is either. I just want to be active in my field and get some progress going again.

Thanks again for any help.

tl;dr - I have a good resume, a long gap in relevant work history, practice/rehearse interviewing, am in school taking classes relevant to the field, and still cannot get anyone to take me seriously and hire me.

* DO make eye contact, smile, and laugh. Being a real person with emotions is important!
* DO your research and know a couple talking points about the company/employees/industry beforehand.
* DO come up with a few things you've learned/experiences that are relevant to the company/industry/position.
* DO BE ENTHUSIASTIC. Especially for entry level postions, passion is much more important than that group project you did in college. Tell your interviewer why you like the industry, why you would excel in the position, and why they should pick you. If you do this authentically, it will have a huge effect.

* DO NOT show up late, arrive unkempt, or unprepared. Showing effort on your appearance can cause a great first impression.
* DO NOT outright say you are ""bad"" at anything. Try to spin any lack of experience into ""something I would love to learn"" or ""something I feel I would excel at"".
* DO NOT forget to send a follow up thank you note (email/phone call is fine) after your interview, especially if it includes proof that you've done more research and are even more interested in the job.

Obviously, there are many more points to be added here (feel free to add your own) and the priority of each would depend on the company/industry.

To xxxx

As a recent graduate of the Master of Arts program in Political Science at xxxx University, I am writing to express my sincere interest in the research assistant vacancy at xxx. Upon learning of the position on your website, I determined that xxx provides an ideal environment for me to develop my real-world skills in the policy arena. I am confident that my academic training, as well as experience conducting and presenting both qualitative and quantitative research would be particularly beneficial to this position. 

The pursuit of my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in the field of political science has helped me to develop my organizational and communication skills, as well as a nuanced understanding of contemporary political research methodologies and analysis. During my graduate studies at xxxx University, I demonstrated these skills by conducting – under strict deadlines – independent research on institutions and political deliberation. I consolidated these materials into journal-length studies and oral presentations, two of which I presented at the American Political Science Association’s annual professional conference. I served as a research assistant in the Department of Political Science at xxx University, where I compiled literature reviews, as well as conducted bibliographic and archival research ancillary to ongoing studies; these served as the basis for a book length manuscript on xxx, for which I have also provided editorial assistance. Similarly, as a part of a research team at [undergrad school], I cleaned and indexed large data sets, as well as helped construct a preliminary measurement model for a major multidisciplinary research project. 

Academic collaboration, as well as my effective presentation of research findings at large professional conferences, has proven my ability to communicate with individuals within various organizations and disciplines. My strong analytic, problem-solving, and writing skills make me well qualified to meet the challenges of a research position at xxx. I am ready and motivated to develop my skills further with your organization. Thank you for considering my application.

1) Last year I applied at a company. I submitted a resume and cover letter, got a response like 3 weeks later, a phone interview a week after, and nothing progressed after that. I asked the recruiter what I can do to improve, she told me. Fast forward to today, I did two internships (to improve experience) and was promoted at my part-time job. Is it appropriate to contact the recruiter? I have her email and phone number, is it okay if I email her and ask about any positions?


2) A company I’ve always wanted to work for has an opening.  I started applying with them immediately after I graduated in 2011. 2 years later, I got a course certificate, 2 internships under my belt, a very relevant promotion at work. I’ve applied online in the past before, but I never get a response.  Is it appropriate to cold call the company, ask for the recruiter and talk with them directly?


I feel like it might be too forward and might decrease my chances of ever getting hired. Thanks in advance.

I applied for a ""recent graduates"" position just cause and wouldn't ya know I got selected to interview for once. Unfortunately the interview is 1000 miles from me. On top of that, the agency will not pay for me to come to them, is only doing in-person interviews, and only notified me of my selection 3 days ago for an interview next week.

Obviously I want to go. When I got the email I was overjoyed, until I realized the complexity of the situation. The interview is in St. Louis and I live in VA. The drive is 15 hours and gas isn't cheap, flights out of the local airport are way too expensive and driving to the nearest major airport is still more than I want to spend. It seems that my cheapest option would probably be to drive, which still would mean 2 nights in hotels at least. This is all on top of the loss in income from missing work.  

I realize that I laid out a bunch of cons, but putting a bunch of money (which I don't really have enough of to play around with) into this one interview doesn't appear to be worth it. The job is a government job and would give me some more experience for my resume (albeit not related to what I would like to do), but then again just cause I have an interview doesn't mean I will be selected.

Two days after hiring me, the sous chef stops me in the middle of the day and tells me that something came up with HR and they can't have me working until it's resolved. It had to do with my previous history working for their corporation, but I've never had any big problems so I figured I was all right.

A week later I'm fired in about the most roundabout way possible. I'm unprepared for this because I seriously spent a week running around and making sure my job is secure, but this is at least the sixth time I've been screwed over in the kitchen and I don't want to deal with it any more.

**Start reading here if that backstory was boring for you.**

I've been cooking for a while and I want out; honestly, if I hadn't made some stupid decisions and been utterly depressed during high school, I could have been a professional writer by now. Or maybe just a semi-professional who works an office job to make rent.

I have a pretty packed resume, but it's entirely packed with kitchen jobs. I also spent a lot of time in school but, even after a hundred-something credit hours, I don't have a degree. My resume makes me look like a bloody idiot and I hate it.

I want to turn this all around. I want to get a job that'll keep me around for more than ten seconds and I want to be challenged to do the absolute best I can. Looking at craigslist makes everything look pretty dismal but I want to find that one place that I can get along with and learn something new.

**Some super-vital statistics, maybe helpful (or not)**

* Spent three years knee-deep in the culinary industry, everything from dishwashing and prep-cooking to line and pantry cook, and even sushi chef
* Skilled writer, fiction and nonfiction; also a human dictionary which is pretty helpful sometimes. This naturally means I read, a lot, and anything I can get my hands on
*  A smattering of computer-related skills from a lifetime of tinkering; I can run any major program in any of the big three OSes, completely strip a computer to parts and put it back together again
* Super hobbyist: I'm into video games, board games, pen-and-paper RPGs, painting, studing microcultures online, alternative culture, a shit-ton of ridiculous music, and that's really just the tip of the iceberg

Like I said, I'm looking for tips and I'm looking for direction, I suppose. What do guys like me do for a living?

I'm 21 and I left High School with 7 GCSEs A-C at 16. I attended college to study 3 A-Levels, and did half of it (AS Levels) with mediocre to terrible grades.

And then things went to hell - I had a bit of a breakdown. I was diagnosed with Depression when I was around 11, and I ended up dropping out of the first college due to suicidal thoughts, and I attempted a different course (BTEC, but dropped out - Again!) and spent a while focused on my mental health.
I was then diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and then was on a two-year therapy course.

I'm now in a better place, and want to work. As you may have guessed from the qualifications, I'm British, and I'm on benefits. I detest it, and I hate the idea of spending another few years sitting on my goddamn arse and just *taking* without offering anything back. The Jobcentre aren't pressuring me to find a job, which is a blessing and a curse. It's good because I can find something apt, but it also means they aren't offering me help with this.

This seems like an endless rant, but I could really do with some advice. How the hell am I meant to gloss over it? As much as the Media would like us to believe, there is a big stigma still with Mental illness, and ""Just out of therapy"" doesn't scream ""Hire me.""

That being said, I've been with my company for three years, and I have a degree in my field along with internship and volunteer experience. My previous job was at a retail establishment I worked at for 8+ years.

I'm trying to utilize my degree in alternate methods (technical writing, corporate training, etc, etc). 

I've been religiously writing resumes, CV's, checking Monster, LinkedIn, and Craigslist daily, and I've lost count of the number of applications in total I've sent to locations (definitely more than 20-30+ in a month time span recently).

In networking, I've met a number of people whose first reaction to where I work is, ""I'm sorry"" and then they spout a slew of negative things about my company. And the second is that a recent company policy prevents supervisors from giving references, they are merely allowed to state if someone works there or not.

I'm looking for a job in high end hospitality.

 
Last week I had two job interviews, both were impressed with my references and experience. I was called back yesterday by the first job, who told me they had decided to go with someone else, he was honest and gave me pretty extensive feedback he said ""It was a good interview, you present yourself very well, we had many applicants and we were only hiring two people, you were in the top four, we'd like to keep my resume for any future job openings. If we had to critique you, you seemed a bit nervous in the interview which you could would improve with practice. Good luck, I don't think you'll have any issues with finding a job.""

The second job said they would call back two days ago and they hadn't, the business is really close to my house and I somewhat know the owner, so I decided to take initiative, drop in say hello and buy a coffee so they'd know I was keen (was this the wrong thing to do?). So I went in this morning, it wasn't overly busy, the owner was behind the counter and apologised for not calling me back saying they had been busy. I said that was fine, I was in the area and decided to come in for a takeaway coffee, he said that they'd had a few people in over the weekend and decided to go with someone else, he said ""please don't be offended"" he would keep my resume and call if they needed anyone else.  

Today the same job (second) I had applied for had been reposted. I'm not sure why the owner lied about finding someone, I don't know if I should email or call him and ask if I could have made some improvements. 

Do I keep on applying for jobs in the same way or is there something I'm doing wrong?",,False,self,t5_2uagc,False,,,True,t3_1cg3zt,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1cg3zt/getting_job_interviews_but_not_the_jobs_not_sure/,

I would appreciate your feedback regarding the recommended action for the my current disposition. I hope that this discussion may help others in similar situations to overcome unforeseen realities, due largely to an unfavorable economical climate.

**The Situation:**

* 28 year old college graduate - lives at home with parents
* Out of work since July 2012
* Out of professional work since September 2011
* Unemployment benefits have been exhausted
* Student loans have entered into default due to lack of income
* Going back to school right now is an impossibility for several reasons: my current loans are in default, my credit sucks because of this, and when I do have some income, it will be garnished because of the loans.

The last income I had was a cash paying seasonal opportunity over the holiday season. I made $6.00/hr doing 11 hour (almost daily) shifts. I remember thinking to myself that the work I was doing made me feel like I was working in a dubious Asian factory. Most importantly, I enjoyed being able to slip into a regular working schedule and making money made me happy, too. Today, I am still sitting on a few dollars left from that endeavor but running out fast.

**Job Hunting:**

* Sent out countless online applications since September 2011
* Networking through family and friends (coworkers is not an option while unemployed)
* Cold calling
* LinkedIn
* Applied to companies directly
* Applied to recruiters
* Regular resume updates on Monster, CareerBuilder, etc.
* Visited alma matter and used their resume review services multiple times
* Had business professionals critique and edit my resumes
* Mock interviews and critiquing sessions to improve my interviewing skills
* Registering and visiting job fairs, both in person and virtual

I never get a response. I will get calls from Indian recruiters quite often, especially right after I update my resume online somewhere. But those guys don't have anything that pans out into a job for me!

Whenever someone looks at my experience, they all agree that I have accomplished a reasonable amount of success in my past. It is always agreed upon that my experience is quite unique as well as practical.

The problem is that if I apply to a front desk position somewhere now, the employer wants me to have an impossible amount of experience. Even for a menial job! These expectations are out of control!

If I apply, for example, to a sales job, they want me to have tons of experience and don't realize that I am a great fit for a technology based company. For example: I applied at AT&amp;T to be a customer sales representative. I was not hired because firstly, there were a lot of people vying for that position and secondly, because they deemed me as not as good as someone else. I am a programmer,  I think I know how the damn devices work and I am pretty sure that I can learn whatever information they throw at me during training. It doesn't take a genius to work at a cell phone store. I have experience in customer service and sales and retail. A lot of it. I waited on tables in college, I know how to work long shifts on my feet and taking orders while dealing with irate customers or customers with lots of questions. I have a college degree and I had a hard major and I did well in it. I have experience working in very prestigious corporations and being lucky enough to have very valuable experience there. What in the world do I have to do to prove to someone that I am not an idiot and that I can handle the retail sales position?

I have also had the opportunity to pull some strings through some other professionals I know into another company. My application was submitted by an insider to the HR department for this very large company. The application was rejected the next morning and I was emailed an automated response. I mean I had to guy buy this guy lunch three fucking times to get this shit going and my application gets rejected and no one even got to see the fucking application.

I am afraid that since I have been unemployed for quite some time now, I may not be of any value. ever. Its like I don't fit in anywhere in the work force anymore, and it is very frightening. Currently I have no idea of how I am going to go about getting any sort of life together considering the fact that it is seemingly impossible to get a job!

I really need some advice on what to do.",,False,self,t5_2uagc,1358534902.0,,,True,t3_16twd1,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/16twd1/will_i_fall_out_of_the_work_force_permanently/,

And I did everything I was told not to do.

I come from a pretty square family. We follow the rules, conform, etc. My older sister is a Wall Street alum on her way to beginning medical school. Then there's me - the uber liberal-queer-blue haired-tattooed girl with her hands covered in rings Cultural Anthropologist. What my family hated the MOST was that anthropology part. WHO CAN GET A JOB WITH THAT DEGREE, HUH?!

Being the baby of the family, I asked my parents and sister for help with composing my resume and writing my cover letters. While grammatical assistance and condensing assistance was greatly appreciated, they managed to take away my voice. I sounded like a robot. I'd research every company I was applying to intensely - I'd make it my mission to figure out the atmosphere and culture of the workplace (my degree came in handy for that part!) Every time I tried to fight the robot voice because I was convinced the places I was applying to didn't want that, I'd hear ""You don't want them to throw out your resume because you were too quirky."" Um, hello? I want to be in a place that allows me to be who I am - not a place that I have to hide every aspect of my ""quirky"" personality. 

My resume went from a giant block of black and white to a nicely organized resume with a black and red theme. Not too much color, but not too bland. My cover letter went from selling myself to showcasing myself. I told them I could do great accents, and made fun of my own last name (it's hard to pronounce), but also was intent on explaining my past experiences and why I was qualified. 

I was told to dress super conservatively (skirt and blazer? not my scene..), take off my rings and cover the simple cursive tattoo on my foot for the interview. Literally got into a fight with my mother about my rings and I told her they're a part of me plus a great conversation starter. Her exact words: ""Let me remind you, you've never had to look for a full-time job and know nothing about the job market.""

On the day of the interview, I wore a simple black scoop neck short sleeved shirt with beige slacks and black flats (you could still make out the tattoo) and all of my rings, duh. The first woman to interview me had tattoos on her arms, complimented my rings, and gave me the opportunity to show her how wonderful I am at accents. And also, obviously, asked me questions pertaining to the job. The last woman to interview me stopped mid-interview to say ""you make me laugh, and I think you'd fit in well here.""  It was a success.

Just do your research, folks. Not every place is going to be like this, but I knew that cracking a joke in my cover letter and showing up with a chunk of blue hair was going to help me stand out at this particular place, not hold me back. Being bland and showing up with a stiff business suit wouldn't work here. You have to make sure you'd fit in with the office culture. Either that, or be willing to change for the sake of getting the job. I wasn't willing to do that. 

You don't have to change who you are to get a job :)

I often have multiple interviews where everyone seems really excited and then I won't hear anything for a week or more, and then eventually I'll get a ""we cannot offer you a position here because of reason X"" type emails.

-""We need someone with more Y experience"" (where Y is something I have experience in, which they never asked about, nor mentioned on the job description).
-""We decided we don't want to hire for this position after all""
-""We want someone with less Y experience"" 
-""We decided to change the position to find someone more senior who also had experience in Y"" (in these cases, Y is usually something weird I don't have experience in)

Here's the basic gist of what the issue is:-

As the title states, I have been out of work for about 10 years.  I moved to another country, suffering from depression with the hope of getting my head right and getting myself back in order.  Initially I was medicated and it didn't really have any profound effect and then I pretty much just fell off the radar a bit.  Lost all of my confidence and self-esteem, haven't made any friends at all really, and have also discovered that social anxiety and other phobia problems I have had in the past have gotten considerably worse and have likely contributed to my reclusiveness.  I've basically spending most of my time just existing and that is it.  Last year I finally tried to do something about it and sought out professional help to help me out with my depression and other issues.  It has been successful, for the most part.  I am still a work in progress but I don't feel depressed anymore.  I only really feel burdened by my other issues, but I am doing what i can to work on those everyday.

One of the biggest obstacles I face is that I haven't worked in so long and that has really affected my self-worth a lot and worse still, I know that it doesn't make me look good at all.  There is a job vacancy for an administrative role locally that would suit me, but I am almost certainly nowhere near as good a candidate for the role as others would be.  The main advice I seek is what can I say or do to try and get me an interview at least.  I feel like I need to try and get an interview if possible but I can't even begin to explain my circumstances.  Would it even be ok to mention anything about any of that in my covering letter?  I don't want to portray myself negatively, but I need to be realistic about my situation and at least explain myself.  The application form for the position doesn't really give me an opportunity to explain anything about that at all.  Not really sure what else I can say at this point so I will open it up for questions if anybody wishes to ask any.  I will try to answer them as best as I can but I may not be able to answer everything.

My question is, do I mention that I've applied elsewhere (even though I don't even know if they'll contact me)?

I have my first phone interview scheduled tomorrow with two people from the company. I am applying for an R&amp;D position in a software company. What kind of threw me off is that the first 45 minutes is going to be with the Manager and the rest with a Research Associate. Kind of panicking for some reason and not sure what to expect. Did my research on the company, ""rehearsed"" the standard question and went over my resume, but the fact that there are two people interviewing me kind of freaks me out. I am guessing the reason for the second person is to have a more technical interview. Is this usually the case? Any advice?

*Edit: *

*Thanks all, it went great actually!*

*The first part with the manager went pretty good I think, just general type of questions (""Why do you want to leave academia"", ""What have you done in Java"", ...). He was pretty laid back, so I relaxed quite a bit and it went pretty smoothly. He spent significant amount of time describing the company and what stage are they at if I get hired what is it going to be like. He asked me if I had any questions before the second guy called me, which I did. His response was also thoughtful, straightforward and nice. I also asked him if he had a rough timeline should I be called for an interview, to which he said he will discuss with the second guy interviewing me and will get back to me by the end of the week.*

*Second guy was all technical, but again, pretty relaxed. I was pretty comfortable, open and even joking here and there (before the phone call my hand were shaking... so bizzare). Threw bunch of problems at me, which I think I got through decently. Honestly said I didn't know stuff when it came down to it, etc.*

So, if you visit the site, you get a bunch of broken images. Looks like a shitty version of imgur or Flickr. Importantly, it says ""missing GIMP photo viewer. Get GMP plugin."" And it sends you to gimpsoft.org, which is NOT the official site for the GIMP image editor. Look at the logos, they are different. http://www.gimp.org/downloads/

Looked it up here: http://registry.gimp.org/node/26772

&gt;That site tricks you into installing a modified GIMP installer, which in turn tricks you to install additional software. The creator even claim that they have all right to the content (by the ""Copyright © 2012 Gimphost.com. All rights reserved."" on their page).

&gt;By using any content from these two sites, it is very likely that you are going to install a virus or trojan on your system. Stay clear of it.

So it is a scam. Just trust your gut, folks. If something doesn't feel right, slow down. Investigate. They were preying on the fact that they thought I needed money fast. Just that little extra care will mean that you won't be cheated out of your own money.

Except I'm taking it a bit further. Rather than doing a 40 hour/week internship like a real job, I'm doing a 40 hour internship *and* a second 25 hour internship on the side. So, 65 hour workweek, and because one of them is unpaid, I'm getting less than minimum wage on average.

I asked my friend a few questions like the employee dress code, and what the questions are going to be about and she was crazy helpful. 

I already have an outfit for the interview that complies with dress code (first impressions are everything, right?) But she said the questions are mostly about our activities/experience and what our grades are like in school. The managers already know I have no prior experience and they're alright with that, as they're used to hiring teens, but my grades aren't that great. So now I'm pretty conflicted, *do I lie and say I get A's and B's to sound better, or do I be honest and tell them I usually get C's and B's with occasional D's even though it doesn't sound as good?*

1358818241.0,11,self.GetEmployed,170yoc,My advice on how to get a job.  Pulled from a few sources.,18,7,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/170yoc/my_advice_on_how_to_get_a_job_pulled_from_a_few/,"Listen up everyone! Here's how getting a job works.

Most of you who are looking for a job are probably thinking that the best way to find a job is to look online for postings, walking into places you want to work and asking for an application if they are hiring, or simply just sending your resume to a company and hoping that something sticks.

This doesn't work. You will get lost with the rest of the world that is doing the exact same thing.
The way a company fills a job is by assessing that they have a need and that they need to hire an employee to fill that need. Think of a company as a board room of people sitting around a table. The Boss will say ""We need someone to do A, B, and C. Does anyone know of anyone that could help us with that?""
Then someone will likely say, ""Actually I know a guy/girl that would be perfect for that!"". Now it doesn't happen exactly like that, but you get the gist.

Now, your job is to make sure next time that happens that you are that ""guy/girl"" that this person mentions.
The point is networking.

Pretty much any job you are desiring right now is more likely to be obtained by you knowing someone that has an ""in"" than by filling out an application or handing out resumes.

Here is a simple way to do this. Each person's life is different in the way of how much they interact with people but it's a simple way to do it. Grab a piece of paper and write down 5 -10 companies that you want to work for. Listing them in order from most desirable to least. Do not put a company down on that list just because you have to fill a spot, it needs to be somewhere you would like to work. Then fold up that piece of paper and put it in your wallet/purse/handbang/etc. so that it is with you at all times. The next time you meet someone or hangout with a friend, relative, neighbor, pastor, dentist, doctor, guy at the bus stop, etc. bring up the fact that you are currently looking for work. Get over the embarrassment of not having a job. Then pull that piece of paper out and show it to the person and say, ""I actually am looking for a way to find a job working at these companies"" or however you feel comfortable.

Their reaction will be one of two things:


Good luck to you! Hope you find a job!

or

Actually, I know ______, they work for _______.

If it's the first one, then just enjoy that person's company and move on. They will now know that you are looking for a job with those companies. If its the second response, then say ""That's great! Do you think I could talk to them about what it's like to work there?""

Notice I didn't say ""That's great! Could you ask if they have any openings?"" because that gives that person a chore to do, and likely it will not get done.
If they say yes, then you have just networked and are more likely to get a job with that company than the average joe.

This takes time, don't expect to find that dream job after talking to 10 people, but it just may be that 11th person you talked to that has an uncle that owns the company you want to work for.

**TL;DR**You can't get a job by filling out applications and handing out resumes. It is all about who you know and networking to meet more people that could help you out.

Not yet sure what I want to do",15,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/15vasp/best_ways_to_be_proactive_in_looking_for_job_not/,"I would appreciate any help from redditors on figuring out how I should be proactive in looking for a job, and which careers I should most actively pursue.

I graduated several weeks ago from the UCSB with a 3.7 GPA (rounded up) and an Economics and History double major. I've had 2 internships for companies related to the financial services industry (one where I worked for a small startup, the other assisting a financial advisor) but haven't lined up a job before graduating.

My resume looks good. I've been in several quality student organizations and have had decent internship experience. Interviewers tend to compliment me on my resume and I am confident in face-to-face situations with potential employers. 

However, I by no means know yet what I want to do with my life, and really just want to put my foot in the door of the professional world with a solid first job (whatever the field). I'd also really like to live in the LA area, but beggars can't be choosers, so I could settle for SF or elsewhere if necessary.

I can do quantitative analysis, but I'm much stronger verbally. Thus, I've been submitting my cover letters primarily to LA-based firms (who advertise on my university's career-recruiting website, Gaucholink) for positions that require both qualitative/quantitative analysis, but tend to emphasize writing skills.

However, aside from the last career fair that I went to (where I  scored my last internship) my current employment-seeking methods seem relatively impotent.  Before my university's next career fair in late January, I'd like to ""get my name out there"" to as many companies as possible, in a way where my efforts will have the highest possible payoff (it's disconcerting to spend the time and effort writing cover letters you are almost certain will be futile). 


**TL;DNR**: I have some marketable skills/experience but want to market them more effectively. I am uncertain of what jobs I should look for.

How should I approach companies in a proactive way? Is there anyone at the company I should email or call?

1342554971.0,12,self.GetEmployed,wpviz,How to respond to an insulting job offer that seems typical for my field,15,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/wpviz/how_to_respond_to_an_insulting_job_offer_that/,"So I made it to a third-round interview with a local marketing firm today. I recently quit a job with a different ""marketing"" firm that turned out to be commission-only door-to-door sales, and I had high hopes for this one. They do trade show-style retail events, and their pay structure on the entry level is hourly or commission, whichever's higher.

A little background on myself: I completed an MBA in Marketing Management a year ago, and after a frustratingly long period of part-time temp work, I moved to a big city 900 miles from my hometown in hopes of finding a grown-up career in a more promising job market. Not knowing where else to start, I've simply been searching for jobs  with ""marketing"" as a keyword, and have mostly ended up hearing back from local marketing firms.

So far the employee promotion structures of these firms have been largely the same: sales mook for less than a month &gt; sales mook with a nicer title for 3-6 months &gt; manager still doing sales for about a month &gt; actual manager, probably still doing sales for a nebulous ""as long as it takes"" &gt; own your own office. The offices are small, the client bases are small, and there doesn't seem to be much chance at making it into the big skyscrapery corporate world of my dreams. The owners of these offices are often young, and once they reach the top, there doesn't seem to be anywhere else to go other than ""bequeath everything I've built up to the next schmuck in line and start over in the big-people world.""

It's like there are two different worlds. There's the one where everything has to be done Right and job-hopping shows a lack of commitment and interview questions favor correct rather than candid answers - the one we all hear about from people who try to give up advice about applying for jobs and ""being successful"" - and then there's the world I've been interviewing in, where learning about yourself is valued even if it means job-hopping and where the primary focus seems to be getting bodies in the door without paying them. That second world is not where I wanted my marketing MBA to get me. I want to be a planner and a manager, getting to use the stuff I actually learned in college; and I want to be trained to do that, not to live on commissions and be a salesperson and move ""up"" in some phony structure that's more about extending market reach than any kind of actual upward mobility.

In my interviews, I've said a lot of stuff about being in it for the long haul and looking at an entry-level position as a means to an end, that end being management, that I'm looking for a long-term career with growth prospects, and that I'm concerned about being financially secure. Then, three interviews at this firm later, the manager I'm speaking with mentions the pay: the greater of $7.25/hr or commission at 18% of the show's sales for the day, divided up between myself and whoever else works the show or the rest of the shift. Basically, it sounds like I have a choice between making far below a living wage, and possibly getting shafted by carrying lazy coworkers with the ""team effort"" commission structure. She also mentioned that the firm ""tries to get employees who are looking for full-time work around 35-40 hours a week,"" the wording of which makes me feel like there's a chance I could get shafted on hours as well.

So far, I'm flabbergasted at how low on the corporate food chain I have to start, how long I have to stay there, and how little upward mobility I actually have. I feel foolish being one of those people who's ""holding out for a management job,"" especially in this economy, but, well, dammit I have a masters degree. Don't I qualify for better?

My questions, then, are these: Is this relatively flat structure typical for marketing firms, or do I have better options? Are there no other low-experience marketing jobs available just by the nature of the industry, or have I been applying at the wrong places? Was my education all a waste, and do I need to endure a job that a trained monkey could do (and would get paid better for) before I really qualify for something better? Should I take this job just to hold me over until I find something better? If I do take this job just to tide me over, how much will the appearance of job-hopping actually hurt me in looking for a ""real"" job?


**Tl;dr:** I have plenty of education but little experience, and so far it looks like all the jobs in my field suck anyway. Do they really? Do I need to write off my education as a waste and take the crappy jobs I'm offered, or is there something better out there for me?

I am a Comp Sci major in the south texas area who graduated back in May with my Bachelors. Throughout my college career I had worked in IT as a desktop technician for the university and a computer technician for an entire department. My GPA is an amazing 2.79 and I have sacrificed the majority of my social time for learning about servers, networks, basic security, etc. I have also programmed in C, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, Bash, C++, HTML, Javascript, Php, Android, and Assembly. I also don't have any certifications since they cost money which I am running short of.


I have gone to the career placement on campus and had them review my resume plus help me create a cover letter. I've had experience with interviews since that's how I received my jobs but I asked them tips and so on.


Alright now this past March a company I applied for contacted me and since it was based in San Antonio I couldn't just drive over for an interview so a phone interview was set up. The job I was applying for was Linux Administrator I and I thought I met the qualifications. The initial interview went well because they passed me on to the next interview. The next interview involved me logging into a server and perform various fixes within a set amount of time. For whatever reason I blanked out and struggled the entire time. The next day there was another phone interview and I was asked more questions and I forgot to study DNS on Linux, so I ended up botching that part of the interview. I ended up not getting the job and I just been unsuccessfully trying to get a job ever since then. I've exhausted Monster, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, WorkInTexas, contacts I've made in college, and WorkForce. The only jobs that show up is Senior level positions with at least 10+ years experience which is way beyond me currently. I also even tried BestBuy unsuccessfully.
Although my preference job wise would be a Linux Admin I can also do programming and I have posted a couple of my projects on GitHub. The main company I am interested in getting into is Rackspace and that was the job I interviewed with back in March.


Now the questions.


* Should I bother keep trying with Rackspace?


* Is this normal for a guy with my qualifications to be unemployed for this amount of time?


* Is there anything else I can do besides volunteer/program more that'll make me more potent of a candidate?


* Is there anything besides my GPA that hampers me to obtain a job?


* Is there something I should be doing that I am not?

Actually found quite a few software opportunities through the subreddit for my area -- just searched ""software"" and there was a discussion from 4 months ago asking about jobs in software. Awesome! I went to the website of a local business I recognized, and I found a posting on their website! However, the job posting requested ""3-5 years experience"" in addition to a degree in Computer Science. I have my degree, but I have 9 months experience; I graduated last spring. Is this a problem?

I called their office to find out. Turns out that the experience was not a deal breaker. The man suggested that I email in [my cover letter](http://pastebin.com/BZNCBFAq) (just the body of the email) and [resume](http://imgur.com/rlzotBp) anyway. So, I did. 

And they emailed back! Yippee! They were very understanding. They expressed an interest in having me in for an interview. It sounds like a few people are competing for this job, so that is a challenge. I have been responding to questions via email, and the conversation has been going very well, so far.

We got to the point where they asked me my rate. I haven't done this before, so I figured, rather than play hardball and try to get every penny, let's be honest and help them guide me through it. This might not work some places, but I felt comfortable asking questions because they had been very willing to listen despite me not meeting their preferred 3-5 years experience. So I just said, ""I'm not sure on the rate. I made x at my last position, is there any way you could match that?"" and left it at that. My field (computer programming) has a very wide pay scale, and I don't know where this position is on the scale. I figured, better just admit that I'm learning than to say a crazy number and offend them.

So, I'm waiting to hear back! Hopefully they will invite me for an in-person interview! :-) Would love to hear your feedback on my story. Also, feel free to share you own job search stories about what worked and didn't work for you. Thanks!

I graduated with honors in 2010 with a B.S. in marketing, minor in economics, and I couldn't find anything in my field at the time. I took a job in information systems, and then in 2011 started a graduate program which I am about to finish when my thesis is approved. My masters is in accountancy with an information systems concentration (my thesis is in network audit trail management).

I would like to get in to systems development, but I have had little luck landing a relevant position. It seems that the popular career track for a job like that is to go to get a technical major, intern in your Jr. and Sr. years, and then work with the college career center to land a job. I may have missed that boat.

I am willing to take a paid internship to prove myself if necessary. The issue is that most companies seem to consider internships something that happens in your Jr. and Sr. years of undergrad. Am I too far out of that to have a good shot at internships? With my experience/education, should I be trying another angle to get into this field? I feel that I am somehow ""locked out"" of most of the college-to-career opportunities because I missed the boat with my school's career center.

I'm not really sure what I'm doing...,12,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/zmv8c/just_got_a_part_time_job_after_being_unemployed/,"About a month ago, I was told to apply to a temp agency for work. I show up and the interviews go well. I sign up to get a job at a JCPenney's doing stocking and inventory (full time). Show up at the orientation, fill out paper work, and my direct deposit is signed up and ready. There's one problem, I wasn't told when I started. 



So being the idiot I was, I went and gave my letter of resignation at the movie theater I used to work at for two years (part time). They of course told me I was in good standing and that I could come back anytime I wanted to. Deep down though, I really hated the job and it caused me nothing but stress. The stress came from being in a multi-national chain that felt like there was so much pressure on my shoulders for sales rather than service. 



The temp agency never told me when I officially started. This went on for 3 weeks. I would wait for a call and would get nothing. Not a word in my inbox. Every time I called (**yes I would call them** every other day, so much they got sick of me) they would tell me that they don't know when I start, they had to wait for JCPenney to give the order. I panicked. Not only was I unemployed, I was running out of savings to pay for my monthly student loan bills (keep in mind I live with my mother so I don't pay rent, just the loan statements which have already been consolidated as much as possible).



Just then a bit of motivation and a spark comes my way to walk into a restaurant hiring downtown and apply. I wasn't sure if I would get the job, but I made sure to give it my all in the interview and to dress to kill, even it it was a burger joint. To my shock, I got the job and I start on Tuesday. The one drawback is that the job is only part time and I would more than likely get 25 hours a week. I'm trying to come up with a plan to move out eventually (while I'm still making payments on my student loans). So far my idea is to see how this job goes until I get used to it and hunt for a second part time job. 


**TL;DR Quit my previous job before the other officially started. Now I have a job part time job in the city.**



I guess what I'm asking to those who are still reading this, how do you juggle two jobs? Does it take a while to get used to?

1346948013.0,10,self.GetEmployed,zgdvu,Advice on what type of job I should be targeting?,11,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/zgdvu/advice_on_what_type_of_job_i_should_be_targeting/,"Hello all!  I've got a problem that hopefully someone can help me with or at least point me in the right direction.  I'm unemployed &amp; looking for a job, but I would like to eventually aim for a job that suits my personality and strengths more so than my previous job.  If you want to get to the meat of my question just go to the **QUESTION** section below.

**EMPLOYMENT BACKGROUND**:  I've worked pretty consistently from 2004 - the beginning of this year in the legal field (staff, not attorney), roughly 4 years at one job and then another 4 years at another job, but I quit working at the end of Jan. 2012 so I could focus on school full time.  Now my class load is light enough to where I can balance work &amp; school better.   

**PROBLEM**:  My last job was pretty much an administrative gig.  That's cool but I don't do well with certain important aspects of the job.  I guess you can say I'm not good at taking care of other people's arrangements and I'm not comfortable working through the phone.  I'm not great at making travel arrangements or handling a ""switchboard"" for example.  I feel more comfortable working waaay behind the scenes.  

My first job involved scanning documents to be loaded into databases to eventually database management (didn't need to know how to use Access or SQL) and I felt like I excelled and thrived.  I didn't have to talk a lot aside from troubleshooting, I could listen to music as I worked, and I actually got to use my brain.  Since it was a law firm setting there was work-life balance issues which is why I ultimately left.  

Right now I'm just looking for a temporary gig and can do the admin stuff on a temporary basis with no problem, but I'd like to figure out what kind of work I should pursue to keep me sane in the long run.  

**QUESTION**:  What are some job options that I can work towards that require little of the admin work that I didn't do well in, namely taking care of others and phone responsibilities, and allows me to basically work like a problem-solving hermit?  I know IT or computer related work is probably a major one but is there anything else out there that I may not have considered?

**Educational BKGD just in case, feel free to skip**:  

* Majored in psychology and East Asian studies (focus on Japan), graduated with BA in 2004.  Started taking science courses beginning in 2010 so I could pursue a Nutrition graduate degree (RD track).  VERY recently decided that this would be something better to pursue for fun when I'm closer to retirement.  Courses completed since 2010 are 2 semesters of General Chemistry, 1 semester of O-chem, 1 semester of Intro Bio, 2 semesters of human anatomy &amp; physiology, 1 semester of Microbiology, 1 semester of Nutrition, 1 semester of Stats, and I'm finishing up the 2nd semester of Calculus.  There's an intro to computing course in there somewhere, but no programming courses.

* I am currently doing the Intro to Comp Sci course through Udacity.  Thankfully for me the course uses Python, I tried to teach myself Python a few years ago out of boredom but didn't keep up with it.

* I've also tried my hand at learning MySQL + PHP through books and an online CEU course offered through the local community college.  I passed and got a certificate of completion.  

* I am seriously considering getting an MS Office Excel certification just b/c my limited knowledge of Excel has saved my butt in my admin job and made me invaluable to some of my co-workers.  A friend suggested doing Sharepoint as well.

* Also familiar with VERY basic HTML stuff.  I usually don't bring this up but like my Excel skills this actually proved extremely useful in my admin job as I had to take on some blog publishing duties for some attorneys.  Again it was a matter of not many people knowing how to use it rather than me being some kind of wizard.

In Seattle, and the job search is VERY tough. I don't have the entry-level experience because I wasted my time in my part-time job(at the time, I was getting more hours. Funny enough, they gave me more hours when I was crammed with sometimes 20+ credits and did not have time for internships, but when I did have time they gave me close to nothing hours).

Am I wrong to acknowledge that it's too late for me to get those Internships? Most of the ones I need require that the applicant must be ""pursuing"" a degree, or ""must be sophomore/junior/senior"" in X degree.

* Sensitive to criticism

- I DJ on a radio show at a local community radio station and love music (although don't know how I could parlay this interest into something meaningful monetarily).


- The first company I worked for was a start-up with an internet component and I loved the environment.  We did anything and everything necessary to get the job done.  I saw tangible results of my actions as we moved into larger offices, and our workforce increased from 5 people to 50 in 3 years.


- While at my first company, I learned a lot from the dev team and essentially acted as the [go-between for customers and the development team](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGS2tKQhdhY).  I like the concept of developing something, but have literally zero skills outside of basic HTML/SQL.


- As with most red-blooded Americans, I'm interested in sports.  Football, baseball, and hockey.


- I was a Political Science/Economics major in college and still closely follow the election cycles and politics in general.  One of my roomates from college is currently running for a high-profile seat in a small state in the Northeast.

Most of my employement is customer service.  The last employer I had at career center had positive things to say about me either way and I am still in contact with people to help me with this.  But, I just wanted some outside help too for a second opinion.

Sadly, that happened to me (I feel like if I had a little more time I might have been able to make it though).

Do I write down that I was fired or let go? I read that let go is for something beyond your circumstance, but this directly my fault. So do I put fired then? That sounds kinda bad, I don't know how to ""kindly"" put that I couldn't perform the job. In addition, my temp ""handler"" said, and I quote ""I'm sorry, but they're gonna have to let you go."" How can I put this on a resume without raising red flags? The atmosphere of the job felt like ""You'll be given a few months to prove yourself, if you can't do that, sorry, but you can't work here, nothing personal."", where as I when I read fired, I think of ""You just totally screwed up and we no longer want you.

My father has been out of a job for almost 6 years now.  Sure he's had a few temporary ones here and there, but nothing substantial.  However he's stuck in a vicious cycle that I'm sure sounds familiar to all of us here.

Earlier, he would be very proactive in regards to finding jobs, always looking through classifieds, talking to other people, trying to find opportunities everywhere he looked.  Keep in mind however, that my dad is reaching 60 years old, his only degree is a Bachelor's in business, and he worked the same dead-end job since he was 17 until he was laid off in his 50s.  

Yet as the days went on, he started to get super depressed, to this day he still takes his anger out on my mother, not physically, but verbally. He berates her for working overtime, and talking about her job; claiming that she cares more about her work than her family (He is very old-fashioned and conservative) but I know he's really yelling at himself, trying to bring us down to his level.

Now he spends all day on the computer playing solitaire, or listening to sports radio.  No more classified ads, no more interviews, he doesn't even talk about getting a new job. 

My oldest sister, since my dad was laid off, has had two children, the youngest being only about a month old.  He has completely submerged himself into becoming what I call ""a full time nanny"" for these kids.  Of course I know the importance of a grandfather spending time with his grandkids, but I never see the man anymore.  Every night when I come home, my mom is either at work or sleeping, and my dad is at my sister's house taking care of his grandchildren, or fixing up my sister's house, buying my niece and nephew new toys, sharing pictures of them, etc.

His grandchildren make him happy, obviously, so what did he do?  He completely shut out everything about finding a job and focuses all his energy and efforts on his grandchildren.  It sounds harmless enough, but in reality he's hurting so many people while doing so.

My mom is working three jobs now to pay the bills, I'm 19 and I'm now working 3 jobs to stay financially independent as well as pay off school.  All my older sisters have moved out of my house, and my family looks down upon my dad.  He comes off as lazy and uncaring, when in reality he's the opposite, but he never stopped making excuses for himself.

I know the thought process, its familiar to all of us who are unemployed or hell even dealing with something unpleasant.  We put things off, saying we'll do them later, and do something that brings us comfort.  No one wants to focus on things that make them feel bad or stress them out.  I frequently get anxiety attacks when I think about my future.  I'll tell myself, ""Oh just go out with your friends tonight, think about your career tomorrow, you'll feel better"", and the next day it repeats.

It's a vicious cycle that repeats because of our inability to stop making excuses for ourselves.  Don't become like my father, don't get so lost in your excuses that you lose sight of your goal.  My dad is now considered retired, yet he has mountains of debt with no money to pay it off and my mom is working herself into an early grave while her husband berates her for working so much.

It may seem like you're the only victim of your unemployment, but that's not true.  You're hurting those around you, and making their lives more difficult because of your excuses.  Now take a good hard look at yourself, are you completely devoted to finding a new job?  Or are you honestly just pushing it off and making excuses.  I've been through this process in trying to find a job as well, I also have a part-time so my situation isn't dire, but it still is a problem.  I realized I was just pushing off the inevitable hoping that things would eventually work themselves out, but that never happened.

So stop the cycle, stop worrying so much, and just get out there and show the world what you're made of.  I guarantee that things will improve even if you don't land a job.  ",,False,self,t5_2uagc,False,,,True,t3_v0f4w,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/v0f4w/stop_making_excuses/,

my boss and I had a simple creative difference (he is a bit of a hot head, too) and he got mad at me and fired me one day. Many months afterwards, we had a few discussions (on good terms) and he admitted that he made a mistake. I didn't ask him for my job back out of fear that I would be entering a difficult situation.

I qualify very well for many of the job openings and have the required knowledge and experience to excel in it. Plus, I have worked in that institution before. Not only that, but I can provide multiple positive references from people within the company, including the guy that fired me!

Prior to that, I was a sales rep for a small to medium business, I was an OK salesman, left after an argument with manager over commisions owed
Before this, I had another sales role, maternity cover, making appointments for field visits by the sales manager. Good role.
Behind this was one in market research and planning of services.

I finished my undergrad in June, then left the country for a few months (to the place in which I intend to move sometime next year) and now I'm back in my hometown (different city than the one in which I did my undergrad).  I would've stayed in the city where I did my degree, but I don't have family there and I need to save money in order to move next year.  So, I'm forced to live in my hometown with my mom (who is being really good to me and isn't charging rent or anything). 

Problem is, the job market here is horrible.  It doesn't matter what level of education you have, experience, etc.  It's all based on who you know, connections, networking, etc.  And even before anyone suggests to network, I cannot do it.  I do not know anyone in this town that can help me.  Period.

So with that being a bust, not only am I probably never going to find a job here, I can't look for a job in a larger city because I am completely broke and have no startup money to afford rent, bills, etc. until I find a job in the new city.  Plus, as stated, I want to purely *make* money so I can move (starting to sound repetitive?).

In addition to no jobs, this town has absolutely nothing to do.  The major age groups/demographic consists of older people and families.  There is no social cohesion, no volunteer opportunities, no creative outlet, nothing.  There are some courses at the community college, but as stated, I have no money and am now facing loan repayments starting in January from my degree.

Finally, most of my friends have moved out of town permanently for jobs, family stuff, further education, etc.  I don't have a lot of family here either (only child, one parent), and I'm not very close to the family members that do live nearby.

In sum, I am broke, unemployed, bored, and trapped in a city that has nothing to offer, whether it be a job or a creative outlet, or anything.  I don't know why I'm writing this, maybe some suggestions or empathy would be nice.  Thanks for reading.

But (here comes the shameful part), I've never gone through an interview in my life. My entire working career has been through family businesses, and businesses owned by friends. I fianally found the type of work that I love though about a year and a half ago, welding, and since then I've been taking classes, and (as of last August) been trying to get employed. Thismorning I received an email in response to my resume that I emailed in Saturday night. The recruiter was incredibly nice, and made a point of the fact that he had chosen me specifically, but now I'm faced with a couple problems (or what I foresee as being problems).


1. I'm young. I graduated from highschool 2 years early after having completed all the graduation requirements, and I received my diploma last summer. Since then finding a job has been incredibly difficult in this industry due to my age (I actually had a recruiter look at me after he found out my real age, and tell me to leave). So I'm terrified of making the commute to the city, only to be turned away.

2. I've never been in such a formal interview before. The recruiter said to come in ""full interview attire"", which for me consists of a dress shirt/pants/shoes, and a tie. I don't know of this is acceptable enough? Or if a full suit will really be required. 

And finally 3. The nerves. How do you manage to stay calm? I don't have a problem talking to people, or interacting at all, but I have a tendency to get a knot of anticipation in my stomach whenever I'm facing the unknown. Any tips on how to stay calm and composed for that first initial handshake? 



Any advice would be greatly appreciated :) My apologies on how long the post was. Thank you for reading :)

I was invited to fly out to interview with a relatively small consulting firm in November. I met with most everyone, including the Pres and VP. The VP was my contact, and was the one who picked me up from the airport.

After the interview, I was told to expect to hear back around mid-December.

When that came and passed without any word, I emailed both the Pres. and VP, an did not hear back at all. I gave them a week to respond.

On Dec. 27 (Thursday) I then texted the VP (I was anxious, didn't want to risk bothering them via phone, and had texted him previously when he came to pick me up from the airport; also, we are both football fans so I piggy-backed my query with wishing his team luck) inquiring as to the status of the position, and reiterating my excitement with it.

He apologized that neither him or the Pres. had replied to my email, and said that no decision has been made. He said he would talk to others in the firm, and send me a proper update soon, most likely by Monday (which was Dec 31).

As of today, I have yet to hear anything, and am baffled and also annoyed. I feel like they are being disrespectful and unprofessional, and I'm not sure what my next move should be. I very much want the job, and feel that is is genuinely a great fit. But this is pretty ridiculous...

I suppose I should call them on Monday. If you agree, what do you think I should say?

Should I send the Pres. and VP another email? Text the VP again? If so, what do I say?

The interview went really well, I was very qualified, and they gave me a form to fill out for a background check and told me they would call me the next week to let me know when training would start.  The assumption they gave me at the time was that I had the job, so I declined the other position.   (the reason for this was that they left the room to discuss my interview, came back and then showed me the building and let me follow another employee at the company for a while, and said things like they would be excited to have me- but no firm, ""We are offering you a job"" statements, probably because background check needed to be completed.)

To Online Learning at X Community College:

I am very happy to hear about your opening for an Online Learning Multimedia Activities and Educational Games Specialist. I heard about the position through X, my neighbor and the Director of Distance Learning at XCC. This position enables XCC to rise above its competitors by creating novel interactive learning opportunities. As someone with outstanding technical competency, who knows the student perspective, and is dedicated to finding the best solution possible, I am the right person for this position.

* _Outstanding technical competency_. I took two semesters at X X University in game development and design, using Unity 3D, 3DS Max, Blender, and Thingiverse, a collection of reusable 3D models. I spent 6 months at X, a premier software development firm in X. With the innovative X Laptop Orchestra, I used an array of creative muscial tools. Proficient in game and multimedia technolgies and always willing to learn, I am a great selection for technical mastery.

* _Knowing the student perspective._ During the 2012-13 school year, I took four courses at XCC, complete with XCC email, Blackboard, and everyone's favorite: buying textbooks. I attended X University, receiving my Bachelor's in Computer Science in 2012. Studying in higher education for the past five years, I am intimately familiar with the challenges of student life. 

* _Dedicated to finding the best solution possible._ At X, I maintained a 3.62 GPA, graduating with honors from the X Honors College. In professional software development with X, crucial mantras were “the simplest thing that could work,” “let's run the experiment,” and “what's right for the user?” Throughout my academic and professional career, I dedicated myself to finding the best solution possible. 

I eagerly anticipate your response about the opening for the Online Learning Multimedia Activities and Educational Games Specialist. I would love to come in for a meeting and talk about the vision for online learning at XCC.

Sincerely,

I know, internship doesn't seem like much, but it would absolutely rock if I'll get the job.

I spend a lot of time preparing for interview, but I have a problem (probably a popular one) with presenting my job history in an attractive manner (simply because my job history is pretty lame).
For instance, I recently quit job as an real estate agent because it was a commission only job that made working for mc donalds look like a stable and very profitable endeavor. I know that being painfully honest with the interviewer might not do the trick, so  I am trying to figure out how to answer the dreaded question ""why did you quit?""

Currently I am thinking about saying something like ""Thirst of challenge combined with wondrous opportunities for learning call me forth to work abroad"" but in a less silly manner.

Now I am waiting for a call from interviewer and I am dead-set on simply blowing hers mind and then proceed to change that hotels history FOREVER, but this question tends to be my achilles heel. I would appreciate any help that could get my creativity working.

I have only been using the ""apply on LinkedIn"" function, and avoiding the ""apply on company website"" applications because that takes much more time and seems to have the same rate of applications/people reading them.
 
It seems like it is a fast way to get a lot of resumes out there. I have not been writing cover letters, since they take longer to complete and there is no guarantee anyone reads them. LinkedIn sends you an email every time an application is viewed so I know the views/application rate is about %10. I also view the profile of the person who posted it so they will get a separate notification. I have been attaching resumes as PDF's.

My basic idea is that this is a fast way to fire off a ton of resumes, and it is about as effective as anything else (not very), but at least it is fast and efficient. It is much easier to apply for 100 jobs this way than it is to apply for 100 jobs on company websites, when each app takes at least 30 minutes. Thoughts? Am I wrong? Would I be better off attaching a generic cover letter versus no cover letter at all? If I am wrong, or a jerk, or both, please say so.

years ago. 

 Last year I graduated from a Law school that is consistently ranked  as one of the  Top 20 law schools in the country by US News and World Report. However  my law schools grades put me in the  bottom quarter of my graduating class ( grades are everything in entry level law hiring) and  to make matters worse failed my local state bar in  my first try. I retook the bar  this February and will  know if I passed next week, but at this point   passing  the bar is  more of a point of pride,  Law is dead as a career (  hiring is about a third what it was before the recession)  and my  law career seems  either dead or stalled at  the moment.


  Local school  boards do hire JD's as  social studies teachers and i have received interest from boards I have contacted.. but first i must get certified which is  a year long process and  means  the earliest i could work fulltime for them is  August 2014.

Which means   I now have 2 resumes. Both of which  I have submitted to over one thousand places  ( seeking retail work clerical work, anything really) and  received ZERO interviews.  The One  with my J.D on it  gets thrown out because I am apparently "" overqualified"" and not someone worth training since i will "" leave "". 


The second  resume   does not list my J.D, but there i have the problem that the only work experience i have is with my family's  property management firm.  

I have no references outside of my father and other family members  and my landlady during Law school. I made no real friends in college or law school and  i don't really have much contact with my  high school friends  beyond  posting on each others Facebook walls  a couple of times per year.

Please help. I need to eat between now and when my teacher certification comes through. To say nothing of the  $ 150,000 in  student loan debt i have. 

 Which resume should I use?  is there anywhere where i can  get   a month to month contract or something of the sort?  

 The only advice I  get is that i should volunteer in an office and hope  they hire me, but I need to make money , and if they already  are getting my services for free I don't understand why all of  a sudden they will see a need  to spend money on me.

I work for a large U.S. coal company.  The coal industry is pretty much tanking right now; my company has been laying off coal miners since mid-summer and they've just now started in on the office/salaried folks.

I started working with this company right after graduation in summer 2011.  All of my work experience--including summer internships--is in the mining industry.  Coal mining is pretty much the only industry in my immediate area, so if I get laid off there is not really a chance of getting hired by another coal company.

I live close enough to commute to larger cities in the east Tennessee area (it would be about an hour commute one-way), but would need a decent salary to afford that long of a commute.  My question is:  what the heck kind of jobs do I apply for?  My skill set is very specific to the coal mining industry and I really don't know how it will transfer to other engineering fields.  I have experience in technical writing, dealing with regulatory agencies, environmental inspections, and drafting/AutoCAD but I wouldn't say I'm expert-level at anything since I've been working for less than two years.  I'm basically just looking for job titles and industries to look into.

Also, I own a house that would be extremely difficult to sell (since there are no coal jobs available), so moving is not an option.

EDIT:  I maybe should also mention that I have some experience with manual labor, as most of my internships in school were mining production type things.  I am certainly open to this type of work, but I am a pretty small female and in past job interviews I've had people doubt my ability to handle physical labor.  It may be hard for me to actually get a job in that line of work.

BA in technical theater with further improv training. While I am comfortable onstage, it's the technical behind the scenes stuff that I really enjoy. The problem solving/ building/ organizing etc. Lacking 2 accounting classes from having a marketing/ business management minor.

2 years residential/ commercial painting, 1 year carpentry (plus school) experience.

10+ years sales/ customer service (4 in hospitality)

4 years warehouse (During college)

3 years in equipment maintenance. (seasonal)

In the positions I've held, there was no opportunity for a promotion. Simply as they were mostly for smaller companies, and there were at most two positions between myself and the owner. This also means that I have a wide variety of skill sets that I used, but are not apparent from the job description/ title. 

I haven't pursued theater due to trying to get the job to pay for doing theater. (Common for any creative profession) Which was a mistake when I first graduated, but now it's survival. I'm in an area where the building trade markets are over saturated, so falling back on carpentry/ painting is out.

I am trying to avoid sales if at all possible. Basically I enjoy the customer service aspect, but I'm not driven by personal financial gain. Which is a huge detriment if the position calls for cold calling and prospecting. 

I'm not picky about what field I would be working in, and enjoy physical labor as much as mental or social labor. 

Preference would be for a position that allows me to think and make decisions without being micromanaged on every detail. I'm simply much more effective and efficient when I can go off the ""script"" when the situation calls for it. Basically give me the problem, and let me find five or six ways to solve it, then implement the best solution.

I was absolving a job-training/apprenticeship to become a chemical lab technician, specialized in formulating agrochemicals substances. After the usual three years I completed the training and I left the company on my own will, despite being asked to apply for one of the open jobs at the site I worked in. I felt like I needed a change in my life.

Since it's been my wish to work in a foreign country for as long as I can think I would really love to work in the USA for at least a bunch of years; wouldn't mind staying there my whole life.
 
I will give you a quick overview on my education in the last paragraph and a deeper explanation in the following paragraphs.

Our school-system works different than in the US. After I finished my obligatory school I started a job-training in Switzerland. It's usual here that even more complex-jobs like the one I got trained and certificated for (chemical lab technician in agricultural formulation development) are taught in a job-training you can apply for without having studied at a college. You visit a special school 2 days a week and work for your company the other 3 days. During your time in school you learn important stuff regarding the type of job you’re getting trained for and acquire a deep knowledge in those things. At work you learn to apply your gained knowledge while working for the company.

The Subjects you have during your school-days (for a chemical-lab job) are:

* 3 years of Chemistry

* 3 years of Applied Math

* 2 years of Applied Physics

* 2 years of English

* 1 year of Biology


Besides the job-training you're able to study for a professional baccalaureate in a topic related to the field you're studying in. I studied for a professional baccalaureate in the technical-field, containing:

* 3 years of Math

* 3 years of German (because I live in the German speaking part of Switzerland)

* 1 year of Physics

* 1.5 years of Chemistry (less than during the ""normal"" apprenticeship though)

* 2 years of English

* 1 year of English for the Cambridge-FCE

* 1 year of French

* 1 year of History

* 1 year of Economics, Business and Law

* An interdisciplinary project.


At work I have first visited a basic lab course for half a year. Teaching how to behave in a lab and basic synthesizes and analytical methods. After this time I worked in several different teams, mainly in the agrochemical formulation development, working with different formulation types and in different sectors (insecticides, herbicides, etc.). Sometimes I visited courses for a few weeks, teaching more basic methods in the lab, extending what I’ve learned in the first half year. I also had two short stages in other chemical fields. Working 2 months in analytical and 2 months in synthetical process-development.
Other than working together with my job-trainers I had some projects I could work on on my own with my job-trainer as supervisor. Once I was responsible for showing our formulation-testing methods to a co-worker from Singapore (all in English).


In addition to all this I achieved a grade A in the Cambridge First Certificate in English which is, according to my diploma, demonstrating an ability at ""Council of Europe Level C1"". I am content that I could score even higher given a test where you can achieve a higher grade/certificate.


**Quick overview:**
I finished a 3-year apprenticeship in an agrochemical-company to become a federally certificated chemical lab technician, acquired a professional baccalaureate in the technical-field and I have a grade A in the First Certificate in English.

Sales and commission related.,7,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/107xkf/what_to_tell_me_in_an_actual_f2f_interview_about/,"Here's my story and thank you for anyone who reads and replies.

I was a senior store manager for a smaller wireless company. It was great and exciting. I had finished my degree but the job was fun and paid very well compared to stress level. Was making a base of 7.30 an hour (lol) with manager bonus of 350 a month, the same commission as a normal sales rep, for me between 800-1000 a month and bonuses between 0-800 a month with 400 per location I was manager of. 
That changed to a base of 10.15 an hour, and store bonus of 0-600 total.... it was somewhat insulting since we were profitable and I worked my butt of managing two stores. 

So I got a job in retail banking as a part personal banker part teller. Base is 12 and I could in theory get up to a grand in commission. My problem is I was responsible for 25% of the sales and manager was responsible for 75%, and then the manager quit. We got a manager who over sees two branches and now I'm in charge of basically 100%, while still being a 75% teller guy. We aren't making goals, and so I'm not making commission and I'm worried for my career. Customers in store come first, even if its just everyday teller stuff, so I can't do calls. I'm very concerned about being let go, or at least never promoted regardless of my effort level. I really give 110%, but I can't do sales when I'm being a teller since we are short handed. I can barely do the work required as I get more resposoblilty due to high turn over. Had to leave people at my desk for 15 minutes to do something with our ATM that's on a time table and was running out of time. A job responsibility I frankly shouldn't have.

So I've been looking and I want to know how to best explain why I am seeking a different job. I love sales and the idea of my job, but I feel set up for failure and I'm not making the money I was quoted. 

I also don't know how to raise my concerns, since when we have a line out of the door, I don't see how what is happening is OK. I would love to stay at my current job, since I love the career path I could have, but like I said I feel set up for failure. 

I know given my past and the level of effort I give I'm worth having and worth promoting. I've had large amount of success but I can do 100% of sales while doing the same amount of teller transactions as a full time teller and yes they track transactions and I'm 10% below our full timer

If I decide to end today I think I will have two weeks severance pay and I think I'll leave on relatively good terms. My boss said he would be very cooperative with unemployment.

If I chose the part time situation, I think I would work 3 days a week, although unsure how many total hours.

Remoting might work for some tasks, but it has created problems in the past on salary, so I imagine hourly would be even more dramatic. I also commute by bike an hour each way.

Given all the hats of a small company, I do much of the accounting, procurement, invoicing etc so I have a pretty holistic view of the finances. There's some strategy problems, so I'm not sure if the company can/will bounce back.

I'm a bit quirky, but I do have an econ BA from a top 5 school with analytical and accounting background so I don't think I am too FUBAR on finding a job.

Also, I'm not sure if it would make sense to do part time work while under unemployment. I think I would end up netting about the same amount of money if I was just on full benefits, but I am not sure if it makes sense to stay employed. Might look better on a resume, but it would also suck up a lot of my time.

I'm currently doing my PhD in Switzerland. I'm a British citizen with a Bachelors degree and master's degree from the UK. 

I would like to try the USA for a few years at least after my PhD. I don't want to do a post doc. I want a job... preferably out of the lab.

Something like regulatory affairs or medical writing is where I'm hoping for. 

Bachelors is in Molecular and cellular biology

Master's in biomedical sciences with a specialisation in Cell engineering

PhD is in Bio-MEMS (microelectromechanical systems)

So what tips does GetEmployed have? I hope to have my PhD finished by June 2013 so I reckon now is a good time to start looking.

Graduated from an Ivy w/ a B.S. in Chemical Engineering.

I've started trying to learn programming, as I think eventually I would enjoy doing freelance web development (too early to tell if it will hold my interest, but so far I really like it!). My problem is, I won't get to the point of working full-time as a developer for maybe another 2 years until I get enough practice under my belt, but I desperately want to leave my job (would gladly take a huge pay cut, I just want to be able to survive). What are some options of what I might be able to move on to? I'm really interested in science, tech/gadgets, tv &amp; film, startup/entrepreneurial culture. At this point I'm considering going back to waitressing so I can work less hours and focus on the programming.....Any advice would be much appreciated!

He's willing to go back to school to get a degree that will work for him.  He's resourceful mentally (i.e. he can be radically creative with a given situation), he's very intelligent, grasps new concepts quickly.  This combo can lead to easily being bored, so a strict desk job is out of the question; part time at a desk, part time at a job site would work though.

Because he seems able to pick up both technical concepts as well as being creative, I've suggested a form of engineering.  I'm not sure he'd do well with a larger company / engineering firm as he struggles with trusting authority and he has a no-bullshit way of approaching people, so he'd not do well with a large amount of politics.

Lastly, like in the title, he is an immigrant.  In his past, he struggled with communication (heavy accent), prejudice (obvious not-American name), and some culture shock.  This has left him with some insecurity about his ability to ""make it"" in the American professional society.  His ability to communicate has improved tremendously, but there is still the occasional mindlessly rude comment from ignorant people that keeps him pessimistic (rude comments during job interviews for example).

As I walk in May I will have a BA in Cultural Anthropology, and a minor in Music. I also will be finishing my three year employment as a Front of House Manager at our performing arts center, and 9 months as a Box Office Attendant. 

I spent three years as a Music Industry major with the instrument of Trombone until a study abroad to Venezuela. The trip motivated me to finally take a jump to a more academic, reading and writing, sort of major. It has developed a good sense of critical thinking, bias detection, good analysis skills, and has improved my writing style. My professors even compiled a list of around 75 or so ""resume skills"" derived from the major that we may or may not have. 

From the music I dedicated the first three years of college to... I can play trombone and teach music. Ethnomusicology is a field I could definitely see myself fitting into if things so happened to work out that way. I have a lot of interest in South American music. 
The study abroad to Venezuela I attended opened my eyes to the world. We traveled to many ""nucleos,"" centers of music in the social program ""El Sistema,"" during the trip to observe how their system of teaching classical music related to ours. The Shit I Saw... blew my mind up.

Working in the Performing Arts Center I believe has done the most for me. My boss is the Executive Director of the center and has worked within the Arts industry for her entire life, I'm hoping she can pull some clout for me, make some calls... But I know I can't completely rely on that hope. For three years I have worked hundreds of events. Our Center contains 5 Halls, Dance, Recital Hall, Concert Hall, Main Stage Theater, and Studio Theater. Each night I work, I train groups of up to 20+ volunteer ushers to properly handle one of three specific jobs; Greeter, Door Usher/Ticket Scanner, and Aisle/Program Ushers. I also am the link of communication between the Box Office and Technical Crew who makes sure that not only the Theater is being run properly for the patrons, but that the patrons are also receiving satisfactory service. I also have the responsibility of training our volunteer ushers to follow emergency procedures if necessary. 

I guess I'm kind of like the top in the order of power when it comes to costumer relations for the shows. 

I'm a huge fan of large events, such as Music and Arts Festivals that happen all over our country during the summer. Part of me wants to run off and do work with those for a while, then establish myself somewhere to look for Art Center jobs. 

I need help though. I don't know at all what to do to get where I need to be, all I have are hopes that my ""plans"" are going to fall into my lap. So please, some helpful advice or a reality slap could be nice.

I was just wondering if you have any advice on how to answer the salary expectations question?

The manager got back to me today saying that they are interested and he is hoping I haven't accepted any other offers yet. Immediately after I got an email from HR with some questions, including the salary expectations.

Some points to consider.

* I am a fresh graduate (PhD in Physics), but the job is in the R&amp;D department of a software company, and I don't have direct experience in what they do.

It's true, as I was a full time student at the time, and my schooling did play a part in what would eventually come to the company letting me go.

Anyway, what I'm wondering is: is what I put as the ""Reason For Leaving"" considered lying? Should I clarify more in an interview and actually state that I was fired? The job I was fired from has nothing to do with the types of work I'm applying for now.

I've got 9 years in retail, with many untitled leadership roles but only 4 months in a titled role. I interview tomorrow for a Loss Prevention Manager role with AAFES.

What to wear? I've been told in previous interviews I was overdressing, as I always wore a suit &amp; tie. I was considering a button up &amp; tie with slacks but I always was of the opinion that either go suit if you want the professional look or polo and khakis for a business casual look. I have a HUGE variety of either selection, just can't decide which one to go with.

What to expect? I've never NOT received a job after an interview, but getting let go from my previous job with no warning or explanation shook my confidence quite a bit. With most major retail organizations I could do some research to find out how much theft and loss occur due to accidents but AAFES seems to be a little harder to find information on and I'm concerned I'll appear unprepared.

Has anyone around here worked in a salaried position with AAFES? What in particular do they focus their attention on in finding new candidates? Seems like every company looks for a few key things and they are frequently different.

Since it's been 4 years since my last ""real"" interview (my last position had a very laid back interview and they had already decided to hire me before I showed up, the only question was if I would take the job or not) any advice and ""psyching up"" offered is greatly appreciated.

I have come in peace to introduce myself as a Technical Recruiter (and longtime redditor) with a rather large staffing firm here in the United States. Now, I understand that “recruiter” is a bit of a dirty word within the web/software development community, and based upon my experiences with other recruiters in the industry, rightfully so. But please know that I am genuinely interested in getting your honest feedback and opinions on what exactly we can do better, and how to more effectively meet your needs as job seekers. Staffing is not an exact science, and believe me, we can use all of the help we can get. And with that, I humbly throw myself at the feet of you fine gentlemen and ladies and ask for your assistance. 

As a side note, if there is anybody viewing this that may be interested in a new position, whether it be development, project management, network engineering, database administration, etc. please feel free to contact me via inbox. I currently sit in Atlanta and am more in tune with the openings in the Southeast, but we are a national firm with a wide reach, and I can help you get placed pretty much anywhere within the contiguous United States. I WILL NOT POST THESE JOBS UNLESS I RECEIVE AN OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF INTEREST! Otherwise I will send people who express interest to me job listings via inbox.

Again, I don’t mean to disrupt or pollute this wonderful little community of ours with spam job postings, and will not do so under any circumstances. But I think that this may be an interesting experiment to connect like-minded people in different, but linked, industries. Thanks you in advance for your help!

They said they are excited to have me on board and expect me to put my 2 weeks notice in as soon as my background check goes through. I am not worried about anything since I have a clean record and didn't lie about anything regarding my background and education, but there is one concern I would like to describe. 

When I first applied, I did one of those electronic applications. When I attached my resume to the application, I realized I made a huge mistake and accidentally sent them an old resume from my junior year in college. I never deleted it out of my documents folder and it had almost the same exact file name as the updated resume. I figured, well, I guess if I hear back from them I will let them know and give them an updated copy, which is what I did once I heard back. 

I emailed the recruiter and told her that I accidentally attached the wrong resume and to use the updated one (my GPA was not listed on my new resume since it had fallen below a 3.5 during my senior year). She said thanks and we set up the interview. I went to the interview and to my surprise, the panel of people interviewing me were all holding copies of my old resume. I freaked, and gave them all updated copies and told them there was a mistake and that is not the resume I wanted sent in. It was not a big deal, and the interviews went great. 

What I am worried about is if they do an education check and see that my GPA doesn't match up, they'll think I was lying. I told them numerous times it was the wrong resume, and sent them my updated resume which they said they will put on file as the right one. My new resume doesn't even list my GPA, and I was still offered the job so I don't think it will be an issue. However, I also do not want it to appear I am lying if they do an education check and have my old resume in front of them. They said all they do is call the school and verify my degree, so I don't think it's as intricate as a transcript request or anything. 

TL;DR - When I first applied, I accidentally sent an old resume from the middle of my junior year into the recruiters instead of my current resume. The old resume listed a very high GPA which is was at the time. Grades dropped during senior year. New resume didn't even have GPA listed on it. Emailed recruiters numerous times, told them the error, and asked for the new resume to be the one kept on file. Worried that old resume might still be on file since during interview the MDs had my old resume in their hands even after I told them the mistake. Worried whoever does my background check will think I am lying about my education when I am not since old resume might still be the one on file even though I've sent them the new one numerous times.

Topics include ethical/sustainable companies, expats, traveling and questions re my profile.",6,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/v59d2/will_graduate_soon_but_confused_about_employment/,"Hi reddit,

I need some advice about starting my professional career. Here is a little background info on me: I have lived in 7 countries and traveled to about 20 others in my whole life. I am 25 years old, I can speak English, French, German and I decided it was time to complete my bachelor's so I could make some more serious money. I will graduate with a Bachelor in Business Administration in Canada but I am not satisfied with the prospects. As a side note, I am born in Western Europe and all my family is from and still lives there. As a result, I have nobody who could help me land me a job or an interview through relations. I have to fend for myself.

1. 
I have no idea which position I want to occupy. It seems that when applying for a job you should have a very precise idea of the position you are looking for. I'm afraid I'm rather more like “let me see what you have to offer and if something appeals to me”. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem well suited to the current model of job searching. What are your thoughts? Am I wrong on this? How could I get a more accurate picture? I know some things I hate like accounting but I don't think it's accurate enough.

2.
I have a big issue working for companies that contribute to making the world a worst place than it is and screwing people/the planet over (banks, chemical industries, cigarettes…). However, these companies are the largest employers of people with a degree like mine AFAIK. Where should I look for more ethical and sustainable companies who are profitable and will still be able to give me a decent wage? I hope decent pay and ethical business practice isn't as mutually exclusive as it seems?

3.
I have traveled around the world for 3 years, I lived in countries all over and I experienced various cultures. I've had entry level but unusual jobs although they are not consistent with one another aside from being, well, entry level and available almost anywhere on the planet. Is that an asset for me or will it be seen as being flaky and a low achiever by a potential employer?

4. I would love (at least for the first 5 or 10 years of my career) to work as an expat. Is that reasonable to hope being an expat at the beginning of my career or is it more of a “reward” for senior employees?

5. I would like to see what kind of job I could land myself in NYC or SF. Again, is it sensible to expect finding a job in these cities considering I don't have the right to work in the US (visas would need to be made) and only a bachelor's? Will my “atypical” profile help in any way? What kind of pay could I expect?

I was shocked when I signed into the online application this morning to find that my application was rejected. The reason given was that the minimum experience requirements were not met. I beg to differ. 

Their hiring process is fairly transparent and, from what I read, as long as you meet the minimum requirements, your résumé is forwarded on to the hiring manager. My understanding is that the HR department reviews all resumes and cover letters, then selects a reason from a drop-down menu and this is what you see when you sign in. There is no additional information given. 

Would it be tactless to send a message to the human resources department asking them to either reconsider or for a more thorough explanation? I could see getting knocked out after an interview or something, but since I do meet their minimums listed and they are required to forward on any applicants qualified, I can't help but think there's been a mistake. 

Edit: for clarification 

Edit 2: Thank you to everyone for your replies. For anyone interested, I heard back from HR first thing and they re-opened the job for me to re-apply. The HR person recommended I ensure that my resume reflect every related work experience on a timeline. I rewrote my resume as a job-specific from, separating related work experience from professional/other experience. I made sure all the keywords were present.

Previously, I had been more general with my resume, then used the cover letter to unpack the jobs and how they related to the position for which I was applying.

For what it's worth, I know at least three people who work there (including someone who works in a different office of human resources) and each one has told me that they want me to come work with them, but cannot do anything unless I'm applying to *their* specific department.

What I need from you all is a fresh look at how to package my story into a coherent, marketable package. What can I do for what kind of company? This is really something I have trouble figuring out.


**The Basics**

-BS in applied math (think computer modeling, not proofs) with a good GPA. I graduated about 2.5 years ago now

-8 months ""real"" job experience working in the field doing energy efficiency inspections and (very basic) models for houses. I quit to move. I spent time in people's houses crawling around in their attics and probing their heating systems, sat down and input lot of measurements into my laptop, and then tried to sell them insulation upgrades by showing them projected improvements. 

-A few months very part time (10 hours/week) doing very cool, interesting internship helping to analyze data on transportation for my school's Transportation Research Center

-The rest of the time has been spent working in bike shops. So I'm pretty good at fixing bikes. 

**The Problem**

I can't seem to find the sweet spot for what sorts of jobs to apply to and how to market myself. For technical ""analyst"" type positions my couple of semesters of programming classes don't make the cut, but my technical degree and lack of office work seem to keep me out of the running for less technical jobs (this has been brought up by a couple interviewers). 

I really liked my internship, and so I think doing data analysis, especially geographic data (GIS) is my ultimate goal, but at this point I just want to get on track to build up the skills and connections to do that. 

So, GetEmployed, what do you think? Sorry about the rambling wall of text, but finding the concise, powerful way to present this stuff is the whole problem!

I am getting more red flags by the moment with this recruiter and the company hasn't even had their voice heard by me yet. I was just recently fired from a job that basically hired me and performed a bait and switch on me with my job responsibilities. I don't want to find myself out of luck again - and my college career center is suggesting I really don't look at contract to hire work just yet.

One review in particular cited for the same job I am applying for that there was not enough training for the job, and it had too many details for them to be brought up to speed in time. From a FORMER...employee.

So I guess I am wondering reddit, what is your experience with recruiters, what are your suggestions? Keep holding out or go for it? I should also add, this job is 15-16/hr, 6 month contract to hire, and a 100 mile commute round trip each day.....

I like people, and making sales, but I don't know how to break into that market.  I also love doing things with my hands, but employers in those fields won't look at you without some kind of education behind you.  I also don't yet have a car so jobs requiring anything more than cycling or public transit are out.

I'll keep things as short as possible. I worked for my former employer for 4 years; Jan 2008 - Dec 2011. I have never had a written warning, verbal warning, write-ups or anything. I would speak up if I felt wronged and they did screw me over a few times for promotions (that was promised to me) while I was there, even using the excuse ""You didn't get the promotion because you left your wife."" one time. Their main way of getting rid of people now is to target the longest employed employees and harass them until they quit to save the company money and having to pay unemployment/severance. This is what happened to me.


 The HR lady kept messing with my punches on the time card to appear as time fraud but I wouldn't approve the punches, my direct boss who was always a bro turned against me and threw me under the bus citing poor performance and attitude problems (weeks prior he told me he was grooming me to be his replacement when he transferred stores). The store manager said ""If you don't like it (the harassment), you could quit but wouldn't get unemployment. Needless to say they wanted me to quit and just suffer and be poor. Luckily I had an illness that started a month and a half before I quit but I kept working through it. I spoke to a Doctor and told him of the harassment coupled with the illness and how it was effecting my sleep, life in general etc. He gave me some paperwork that allowed me to quit and still get unemployment.

My employer and the people there who harassed me were furious that I was able to get unemployment. The HR lady called government services several times trying to get my unemployment revoked but they basically told her ""He's got tons of medical paperwork, stop calling us, it sounds like you just want to harass the guy"".

Basically I haven't worked since Dec 2011. I started college last year as a full time student and I did miss a gap of a couple of months when my mom passed away last year. It was a tough time for me dealing with that. I've remade my resume countless times. I've taken a resume course and got a perfect grade and was told my new resume is awesome. I've been pounding the pavement and applying online daily with no callbacks. I feel like maybe potential new employers are calling my former employer and that's why they are not hiring me. I could leave it off my resume but it would then appear that my last year of working was 2008.

What should I do in this situation? I'm a full-time college student and I need a part time job to help out. It's putting tremendous pressure on my relationship and life in general.

From what I understand, it is beneficial to take charge of the application process by calling the hiring manager to ensure that your resume gets noticed and to provide a better chance for an interview by being proactive (i.e. stating in cover letter of a time and date for a follow up phone call).  However, for many of the jobs that I am seeking (mainly hospitals and universities), applications are reviewed by HR first, then sent to the hiring manager.  This confounds me since I'm unsure what exactly HR would be looking for and whether or not, while my resume may impress a hiring manager, it does anything for HR.  

I have asked HR if I could have the contact info of the hiring managers so that I may contact them, but they are unable to supply this information.  As someone who likes to have some control, it bothers me that in these cases there's pretty much nothing I can do except  roll the dice and hope for the best.

In other words, i've wasted a lot of time.

I graduated in 2009, and diligently tried to find work during the worst part of the economy's job crisis. I decided at that time this would be a good time to pursue an idea I had to start a company. That failed, and over the next few years I would work short term jobs, work with relatives, and worked with a temp agency.

I don't know what to do with my resume. Each of my jobs had nothing to do with anything that I want to do with my life, but I took the advice of many and did something, because it was better than nothing. I have no idea how house painting, or working as a mechanic, working for a consulting startup, assembling/shipping heat sinks and a failed entrepreneurial effort would help me land a job. I have an economics degree from a well known university, and would love to get into a role as an analyst where my education can pay off.

My main issue comes when I apply for jobs. First and foremost, I don't know what to add to my resume. I haven't updated it in years because of that. These were all temporary jobs from the get go, so there is a lot of short term employment. 

Cover letters are next. I have a hard time filling in a page without getting the feeling i'm wasting my time. I say this because all of the skills I acquired from my education are not very tangible. Economics gives you a broad tool set, but not really any ""skills""(Strong analytic skills, critical thinking, strong leader, gets the best out of others, creative innovative thinker) but ask me why I think that, and I have nothing tangible, so I chalk it up to sounding like BS to the employer. Anyone can say that they can do all that, which is why I think it sounds like BS.

I am the second in my family to graduate college, friends are all high school only graduates(and not very helpful for other reasons) I have no one to get any advice from, and had no one to look up to growing up. Could really use some advice.

I want to get some answers so best to not make this post too long.

For what it's worth I've been very hesitant to ask for advice in the past since i've usually been met with ridicule and mockery. I'll try to be brief with my situation 

**Brief Synopsis:** I have an accounting/finance degree from a university where I graduated with average grades (3.2 gpa). While at school I completed an internship as a financial analyst and was an accounting liaison for a small business advisory group (student run organization, but basically I was doing the accounting for a start up business). After graduating I worked for 6 months at a fortune 500 insurance company as a financial analyst, it was a good experience and I was a contracted employee. Other than that my degree hasn't gotten much use. 


**what I'm looking for:** I'm not looking to get my cpa and i'm definitely not looking to work for the big 4 or anything. I realize they're way out of my league. I don't really have high expectations, all I really want is a job that is related to accounting or finance, really anything even vaguely connected. I want to put my degree to use. I really didn't mind my work as an analyst and i'd be fine doing something similar (data entry perhaps). I just want to build my resume and get my foot in the door somewhere doing something. In the meantime i've been applying to places such as Best Buy and Gamestop but I haven't had much luck with those sorts of gigs either. I worked as a cook in the past and i've considered going back into that work much to my chagrin. 

**what I need help with:** basically I want to know what i'm qualified for and what I should be doing to better my chances of getting hired (I know i'm not the bell of the ball in terms of candidates, even just looking on this subreddit has made me feel pretty low on the totem pole). I'm with a bunch of temp agencies and I try to apply to at least 20 places a week, but that varies. My networking skills aren't great, admittedly, and i'm a pretty bland interviewee but i'm working on it. My resume is fine and it's been revamped many times but i'd be more than happy to PM it to someone if they wanted to look at it. 

Any help at all would be much appreciated and I can spare some more details if need be. I hope this wasn't too long to read. I really appreciate any responses and most of all your time. Thanks!

I was laid off this year and took another step backwards because I couldn't afford to live on unemployment, and I took a position working front desk in a huge medical practice. I am now making the least amount of money I have made since graduating college and feel like I'm selling myself short on what I deserve. 

The problem is I don't seem to be able to find any jobs that I'm qualified for that will pay what I was making 5 years ago. I am a hard worker, a quick learner, and I have a great work ethic. I just need to catch a break and I can prove myself.

Background info (recent college grad B.S. in Hospitality Management, currently working two jobs one in marketing - Real Estate company, one in retail - Golf course).

Here are some of the questions I am expecting and my answers for them:

1. Tell me about yourself:
I am a young professional with most of my experience in the retail/hospitality industry, and a recent college graduate with a bachelor's degree in hospitality management. This has given me a lot of experience with customer service, and a focus on creating memorable experiences for every guest. I also enjoy playing guitar, working out, and living a healthy lifestyle.

2. Why did you leave your last job?: 
I had a great time at both of my most recent jobs, and learned a lot about what makes a business successful. I am looking to continue to grow my skill set in a successful company where my performance has an impact on that future success.

3. What is your biggest weakness?: I feel my biggest weakness is I seem to lack confidence when having to impress someone. I have been working on this partly through performing and singing with guitar to build up my confidence. Being in the spotlight makes me feel awkward when I am with new people. It normally takes me a couple days to open up.

These are just some of the questions I've had in past interviews I've found the most difficult for me to answer. Any advice helps and here are some of the questions I've prepared to ask:

What kind of training opportunities will there be to improve my skills?
What is your favorite memory while working for Walgreens?

[wall of text],4,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1fqxcd/a_tale_of_two_scams_friendly_advice_to_keep_your/,"Hello. Just a friendly reminder to all job-seekers: be careful out there. I have already encountered two scam attempts in the few weeks I have been responding to ads on craigslist. Yes, I know, craigslist is not exactly the cream of the crop. But, I have had very good success buying and selling musical instruments and whatnot on craigslist, so I figured I might have similar success looking for jobs.

**Scam 1:** I advertised myself on craigslist as a tutor. Someone responded, saying he wanted his 15-year old daughter Sharon to learn about ""databases and the Internet."" His English was very poor. He claimed that he was in town to talk with Johnson &amp; Johnson, so I assumed he was an Indian researcher who didn't know English very well. In retrospect, this was a mistake on my part.

A few emails later, we had the schedule set out, as well as the money. Then, this message came.

&gt; From hereweride Beau weridehere@gmail.com

&gt;I was just notified that the total amount of   $2480,which covers the total expenses for the duration i will be sojourning in your area was mailed out in one check and that was the check mailed to you. Please note that this includes my accommodation fee and every other expenses i will be undertaking.  

Note, he said that Johnson &amp; Johnson would cover his accommodations, and that my lessons for his daughter would be covered under that.

&gt;Now that the check has been mailed to you, I will like you be of help to have this problem fixed. Once you get the check,  go ahead and have the check deposited for 24 hrs within which it will be verified and cleared to your account. After this, you are to deduct $480 which is lesson fee plus $50 for your running around, then help me to send $1,600 to the landlord of the apartment where we will be staying when we arrive via MONEY GRAM ,  as I have already made reservation for that. The remaining amount will be collected from you when we meet Here is the information of the  landlord below:

 
&gt;LANDLORD  INFORMATION

&gt;Name:  Jill Roby

&gt;Address:  865 S Douglas

&gt;Springfield,  MO  65806
 
&gt; I believe I can count on you and that is why I am comfortable by letting you handle this money transfer for me,  Please make sure you get this done  ASAP because I have to move in next week but only have to wait till the landlady gets her money so that I can have the key once we arrive . Do get back to me with the MONEY GRAM   details such as the Sender's Name and Address,The reference # and the amount sent e.t.c. Waiting to read  back from you
Thanks And Stay Bless

Problem: You deal face-to-face on craigslist. You do not deal in MoneyGram, money orders, Western Union, or anything like that. This is stated clearly in the Help section of craigslist. edit: http://www.craigslist.org/about/scams

Problem: This is the Nigerian prince scam. Not necessarily Nigerian; they could be American, Chinese, Russian, Indian, Nigerian, or something else. Not necessarily princes; they could just be jerk-offs.

I did not respond. I just marked the message as phishing in Gmail. Hopefully my one little data point will help Google become better at detecting phishing attempts.

Scam 1.5: Actually for the same posting as a tutor, I received this email which did not fool me at all.

&gt;Need an Honest Worker

&gt;We have a job available. 5-7 hours a week and 12$ per hour. If you are interested than E-mail us back with your Email ID on support@shop670.com . Get paid the same day.

&gt;Thanks,

&gt;Shop670

**Scam 2:** Not technically a scam, but dishonest and scummy. The posting was very vague. Anyway, he offered $450 a week, which is a little above $10/hr for 40 hours. Sounded like my kind of gig.

Problem: There was no job description in the post.

Problem: There was no company name in the post. (blah blah confidential, blow it out your ass.)

I went in to their local office. Very convenient, actually: just filled out a 2-page application an had an interview. Two other people were there for interviews. The guy was dressed in business professional. Turns out they were a ""distributor"" for Kirby, the vacuum cleaners that are sold door-to-door. This was kept under the radar the whole time: very dishonest, in my opinion. I do not want to trick my way into people's homes and try to scam them on an overpriced vacuum ""system."" If you doubt that Kirby is a scam, search reddit for stories about being a vacuum salesman. Very informative, actually.

Hopefully, you can benefit just a little bit from my experience. I am naive and honest. In my previous dealings, being honest has been very helpful.

 I'm currently looking for a job in finance in some sort of research and analysis type role. A bit about my background: I recently graduated with a degree in math/economics, and am working toward my CFA. I have two interviews coming up this week. One is for a Jr. Business Analyst at a local company that offers tech solutions to local mutual/hedge funds. 

In my past interviews it feels like I may not have given the right answer to questions that ask me about my long term goals or where I see myself in 5 years. Honestly, I don't know the answer to that yet. I don't really have a specific goal in mind to reach a certain role because I'm a fresh graduate and I need to actually find a job first to see if I like it or not. But usually the way I used to answer those is just tell them that I was looking for a role in risk management or a research analyst type position because I feel that's what I would enjoy the most. 

Now my previous interviews were for positions that weren't really related to what I had mentioned in my long term goals and it seems like it would raise a red flag. So what should I say? I mean I can straight up lie and say I want to stay with this company as long as possible and work my way up, but that sounds like a load of crap for roles that aren't exactly tailored to my academic background. 

I have also been asked questions that are something like: ""your background is fairly technical, and this role doesn't require that much technical knowledge, so why do you want it?"" Once again, not sure what to say other than ""I want the experience"". Right now I'm literally looking for any job that can help my career move forward. I feel if I can answer these questions properly in an interview, it would help quite a bit.",,False,self,t5_2uagc,False,,,True,t3_1cevp8,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1cevp8/how_to_answer_questions_regarding_longshort_term/,

I have a university degree ( M.A. in political science, history and philosophy) and I only have a little bit of working experience in various fields for about three years, ranging from being a call center agent, PR and media slave to private teaching for the last 8 months.


Now there is a local music instrument store building new shops in my whole region and they are constantly seeking employees from store manager, accountant to mostly students for simple temp jobs, but they also strongly advertise for open unsolicited applications. 


Music making is my long time hobby and love and it ranged from a help job in a guitar store as a teen, to being a musician, guitar teacher, roadie and so on.

My problem:
I can't come up with a specific position I can concentrate on while writing my application. So what postitions are generally ""available"" in such an expanding enterprise or maybe useful besides the usual ones? To be honest, I currently have ""PR &amp; Marketing, Music-Advisor und Internal Strategies"" in mind. But this sounds corny to me and covers way to much fields for one job.

I need a little advice. I'm a 22-year-old job seeker in Augusta, GA. I'm a Virginia College graduate with a diploma in Medical Assisting. I never took the certification exam, however. I went to college mostly for the wrong reasons. I was kind of forced into it. Not that I wouldn't enjoy being an MA, I'm just not sure I'm cut out for it. 

The only job I've ever had was a sales associate at Dollar General. I was only there a month because of their three strikes policy on cash registers coming up really short. 

I've been doing the internet/walk-in thing for almost a year now. Obviously that's not working, but if I don't do things the way my family wants then they won't help me. So I've had no advice on how to do it differently. I have no idea where to start on this networking thing.

I'm just at a loss. I don't know what to do. I need help, r/GetEmployed. I'm aimless. Can you help me put a new plan together?

I'll start by saying I'm not in the U.S., I'm in one of the Eastern European countries and I'm 32 years old. I worked in the e-commerce industry since 2007, started as a Marketing Specialist in a big online store (one of the biggest in the country), after 2 years there I got a job at a big retailer as Marketing Manager. The company was bought out and forced to move its office to a different part of the country, I was offered the same position for 2/3 of my original pay, so I declined. Shortly after, I found a job as E-Commerce Manager at an advertising agency. Unfortunately, the jobs of everyone in the e-commerce team hanged mostly on one big contract, and for various reasons the agency lost that contract to one of their competitors. This of course means the entire team, myself included, found themselves unemployed.

This was a year ago. I've been actively looking for a new job in the industry for that entire time, and the main feedback I get when applying for similar positions is that I'm ""overqualified"". This happened at least 5 times in the past year, when I thought I have a really good shot at getting the job (so this is not an isolated incident). I have no idea how to deal with this anymore. I am quite clearly not overqualified, because I'm applying for positions similar to the last one I held. These are not entry level jobs.

I started my own business out of frustration few months ago (also to be able to explain the gap in my employment history), but I can't really afford to invest too much into it, so at the moment it's not capable of achieving the necessary scale to provide me with an actual full time job.

My question is - is ""overqualification"" common feedback? Is it commonly used to get rid of candidates that won't be hired for reasons that can't be officially stated? Is there anything I can do to deal with it?

I am sick and tired of not hearing anything back from companies that I apply to. It is not a difficult thing to send out a bulk email to a list of rejected candidates - they must have them in a database in order to shortlist them - so why can't they just send off a short message so that we know what the situation is? 30 years ago, secretaries had to hand type a letter to each and every applicant, which was done every time because it is the right thing to do. My guess as to the cause of this being lost is laziness (although I may be biased - I never met an HR department that I didn't want to throw out of the window).

Full time, permanent. No freelance.

Here are my problems:

JAVASCRIPT...

* I don't know enough JavaScript. In fact, I hate it. I hate infinite scrolling, animated buttons, pop-up/over ads, etc. I need to find a way to make myself *like* JavaScript. What is the least amount of JavaScript I need to know?

* What are some basic things I can start with that I can easily build myself with JS? Form validation? Any other suggestions?

PEOPLE SKILLS...

* I'm not a people person. I'm sure that when people hire me, they get that I'm an introverted nerd. But I think it might be a hindrance. I'd always hoped that someone would accept me as I am, but that isn't the way the world works. Am I right? Do I need to work on my social skills? I'd actually really love to become more self-confident, but I don't want to become an ass-kisser.

* I also can't relate to ""common"" people. A lot of people who work in the industry are into sports, fashion, holidays, whatever is popular on TV - I really couldn't give a shit about this stuff. I don't want to feel like I have to fake interests just to get along with people. I once lied about liking GoT in a job interview (didn't get it anyway), but I don't want to have to do that.

* My friends/family/acquaintances know what I do, but when it comes to web-related stuff, always opt to do it themselves or get their BFF to help. Is there anything I can do to change the view of the people I already know? I hear that you only get one chance to make a first impression.

NETWORKING...

* How do I network? Is it a matter of signing up to events on meetup.com? I've never had much success with this kind of thing - Plus, a lot of these gatherings are after dark. And I'm terrified of going out to the city ALONE after dark (I'm a petite lady). Maybe I can coax a good friend into going with me to be my wing-man/lady?

When scheduling the interview, the supervisor was very vague and we agreed to speak at 10:30 today. She sent me a google invite with a conference call code, and shared the invite with me and her coworker, as it was supposed to be a group interview. She did not give me instructions regarding the call, so I assumed she would just call me. I guess I should have clarified, but I have participated in many phone interviews and it has always been the case that the interviewer called me first. 

When I had not received a call by 10:45, I assumed they were running behind schedule and thought about whether or not I should call them first. However, I was not sure how to do so with the conference code and what not. The interviewer then calls me at around 11 saying we had an appointment at 10:30, and asked (quite rudely) what had happened. I apologized profusely and explained that I had assumed they would iniate the call. She then got angry and said ""it's 11, what were you going to do if I hadn't called?"" I apologized again for the confusion, and she just said ""I don't even know how to deal with this right now, I'll call you back."" 

Is this normal behavior? I regret not having clarified the call instructions, but I feel like the interviewer's reaction was unnecessary. I have another job, so I'm not too upset about this and have learned for the future.

We want to live together in New Jersey (ideally, central, but willing to go more north), so she's primarily looking for jobs in that area.

She's avoiding applying for jobs in NYC because of the commute - the idea of it gives her anxiety, and she doesn't want to spend 1-2+ hours of her day in transit. 

She's been applying off-and-on for several months but hasn't gotten anything promising.  Most of the places that call her back for an interview turn out to be scams, after googling them. (I talked to her today about googling them before she applies, so she hopefully won't waste much more time on these bullshit companies.) 

Anyway, she's feeling pretty down. It seems like the only companies/firms that want her are scams, and the ones that aren't scams are asking for people with more experience. She's had several internships, both during summers and while at school, but from what I can gather, this isn't enough.

Lastly, she's babysitting now every day in the afternoon, so going to local networking events is a little difficult. (It's also getting hard to motivate her to go when she's losing hope that she'll find a job at all.) 

Anyone have advice for her or words of encouragement? 

**tl;dr:** My girlfriend was a Marketing major, graduated in December, can only find jobs that require too much experience or are scams.

**Edit:** I'm about to graduate in a month, potentially have a job in the Princeton area come September that I am getting through an internship that I've worked for the past two summers/holiday breaks. Anyway, September is when we're looking to move in together.  We both have hectic summers with a lot of traveling, so she's looking to start around August. (Is this the appropriate time to start looking for jobs?)

A) If there are any redditors on here with call center knowledge, what exactly does a tech agent do? My initial guess is they are basically the time keepers on the floor, making sure everyone is properly handling  their calls in a timely manner, adhereing to schedules, staying out of auxilary work modes and not spending too much time in after call work (there shouldn't be ANY). If I am wrong, somebody PLEASE correct this.

B) What are the talent scouts looking from me in the interview?

C) What kind of salary am I entitled to? By no means am I trying to get greedy however I do not want to get shafted on my paychecks. The company I work for is quite large and upon returning to them with this project (I previously worked for them 5 years ago with another project), the main reason I decided to reapply with them this time around is their ability to promote from within and see where I can get.

I am really desperate for some help. I apologise in advance for the Rant below.

I really need to find work, not just any work, a job with direction and a future. I left university 6.5 years ago and have been job hunting ever since. Don't get me wrong, I have had work in the last 6.5 years. But only about 3 months (if that) was anything related to my degree. I also did 1 year working in an office job that I hate and made me depressed, and the rest of the time has been working in Bars and Cafes, or doing odd bits of freelance work. I am now currently unemployed and claiming benefits.

I'm a 30 year old male from the UK, my degree is in Music Technology. The direction I have been trying to go in since leaving university has been Television Production. I worked for about 2 months on a TV show during 2011, and I have had about 3 or 4 days work in the industry during 2012.

I send out CVs and try and make contacts all the time, but I never seen to get picked for the jobs. 2012 has been especially difficult for me because I have had several Companies contact me saying that they have work for me coming up and then never hearing from them again. 

The most soul shattering experience for me this year was when I was contacted by a very enthusiastic woman saying there was a 5 month contract and they wanted to use me. I was invited to attend a meeting later that week only to receive an e-mail from her telling me that they had a change of plan and wanted to wait. They would be in contact later in a couple of weeks. 

To say I never heard from her again would be a lie. I e-mailed her 2 weeks later to follow up. I got a call from from someone with in the company working on another show offering me 1 days work. I sent the original lady a ""thank you"" e-mail, to which I received the response ""I haven't forgotten about you"". Well, that is when she forgot about me.

The rest of the summer was the same story with several other companies and no more work. 

I have been supporting myself doing odd jobs here and there for small amounts of money. I have been receiving a good response from local businesses about my photography. However, work has now dried up.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't really know what my qualifications and experience can do for me. I feel like I'm at the bottom of the barrel. I feel sick (and I mean physically sick) and tired of keep on trying and not getting anywhere.

I grew up in a small mid-western town, which luckily was home to a state university.  I attended the university directly after high school, and while I didn't excel, I did OK.  Looking back, I never really knew what I was doing in college, I was just there because I felt it was expected of me.  I never really had a direction, which lead to the degree.  At some point I learned about a degree called ""Individual Studies"".  Basically, this degree was dolled out after completing general education classes, and then a specific number of upper level classes, you are handed a degree.  So, after 5 years, I was awarded a bachelors degree in Individual Studies.

I wasn't really sure what to do with my degree, and somebody (maybe my mother) suggested I try substitute teaching.  I quickly found myself in a long-term position as a 1on1 aide with a young man with disabilities.  He was moved to a special school, and I was hired as his full time aide.  I worked the school year there with him, and for the most part enjoyed the work and learned a lot.

After that year was up, I decided to move out of my hometown, and headed north to be closer to my GF.  I took an apartment in a small town (2500) and gained employment in a nearby town as a teacher's aid for a high-school reading program.  The teacher had many medical problems and was absent much of the time.  He eventually went on disability and I found myself an interim teacher with my own TA.  I had tremendous support from my principal and curriculum director.  I finished out the semester with the school, but my heart was not in my location.  I moved about an hour north, in with my GF, to another town that had a state university.

I started subbing again, and taking classes toward obtaining a masters degree in special education.  At the time, this is what I thought I wanted, and did very well, keeping a near 4.0GPA.  I also picked up a job at Borders during the following holidays to have a little more money in my pocket.  Sometime the next spring I took a job bar-tending at a small blue collar tavern.  At first, it was great, high paced, meeting lots of people, and felt appreciated.  But there was a dark side, that slowly chipped away at me.  I had a boss that was an alcoholic and could not manage the place efficiently.  I had a co-worker (really only 2 of us) that had been there for ever and was generally well loved.  This co-worker was two faced and really only cared about himself, he regularly stole from the business and more or less just did what he wanted.  I slowly quit substituting and attending master level classes.  I was there for 6 yrs, and made very good money, but slowly became very depressed about where I was in life (didn't realize this to later).

About 3 1/2 years ago, I started developing IBS issues (the runny kid).  Now, this bar, I was the only one there and also running an attached liquor store.  The only restrooms were the same ones that the customers used.  Each restroom was a small room with a sink and toilet (mens had a urinal), no partitions, and no locks on the door.  I usually worked 9hr shifts, with little time for a bathroom break, let alone a #2 emergency.  My IBS symptoms kind of creeped up out of no where, and I started having incidents where I had to crap immediately, hot sweats and cramps and all.  These things were one thing to deal with at home, but a nightmare at work.  I started seeing a GI doctor, who after extensive testing, diagnosed me with IBS and sent me on my way.  I talked very frank with my employer about what was going on, took some time off to try and get a hold of everything.  I returned to work, still had troubles, and eventually quit in April of 2010.

I should quickly note, that I developed anxiety related to the IBS.  I never wanted to stray to far away from my ""home-base"".  My romantic life suffered, and friendships were damaged.  I had trouble taking trips to visit family and became a bit of a recluse.  During this time I did odd jobs, dog sat, and dog training.  Luckily I had had a fairly sizable savings that has allowed me to basically live un-employed the last 3 years (No state assistance).

Now we come to about 14 months ago, and discovering Reddit.  I had a wake-up call when I went to the doctor and found I had gained nearly 40pds over the last 2 years.  I was heading down a slippery slope of poor health and he was worried about my cholesterol.  A google search about diets/weightloss/IBS lead me to r/keto.  /r/keto helped me loose a substantial amount of weight and start to feel like I have somewhat of a hold of my IBS.  Couple months back, I stumbled across /r/Paleo and feel like I am one step closer to healing my gut (238pds-187 in a little over a year).  I have been using /r/malefashionadvice  to learn how to dress a little better, which is helping to build my confidence.  I also hang around /r/Fitness and attempting to get phsyically healthier.  /r/stopsmoking gave me the initiative to put down my filthy habit, and have now been cigarette free for 128 days.  I have been lurking around /r/anxiety lately, and it is helping to me understand that I'm not the only one having the feelings I do.  It also gave me the courage to finally go see a therapist last week.

That brings me to now, I need to get a job, but I don't even know where to start.  I am unfamiliar with online sites like Monster or CareerBuilder.  I don't really understand Linkedin.  I have anxiety revolving around building a resume, don't even know where to start.  How do I handle being unemployed for the last 3 years?  I'm really worried that I am only qualified for manual labor or retail, and that I don't really have any marketable skills.  Any help, suggestions, advice will be greatly appreciated.  Also, any other subs I should cross-post.

I could live in Japan or China, or I could stay here in the UK, it's all the same to me.

Should I mention this at all in the hiring process?,2,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1gtwmj/dropped_out_of_college_to_better_myself_and_fix/,"I'm 22 years old and have nothing to my name but a high school diploma, one year's work at a coffeehouse, and &gt;$14,000 in student loans.

My whole college experience has felt like a continuance of senioritis from high school. I was hardly ever motivated to go to class, with only a couple courses as exception. Got a variety of grades, everything from straight F's to A's. I went through cycle after cycle of depression/anxiety, really just felt like I was going ""through the motions"" rather than actually being alive. I was a daily marijuana smoker starting my sophomore year, around which it changed from pure recreational use to self-medication for my depression/anxiety issues. I jumped from one major to another, always unsatisfied.

So recently, as a senior, I decided to just drop out completely so I could get a grip on life and tackle my drug abuse. Despite looking upon a daunting job market, my anxiety has almost completely subsided, and I feel that this was the right decision for me to make at this time. I would like to attempt getting a degree again at some point in my life, but that's not going to be for awhile.

Anyway, my question is, should I mention the fact that I dropped out of college in interviews? If I don't, I can't imagine this 4 years of nothingness (except for a part-time job at a coffeehouse, on campus) making any sense. It seems like it would just make me look all the lazier.

I'd like to hear what people have to say on this matter. Trying to find a job yet being terribly unqualified for most of them is very scary.

A little over a year ago I got my Associate's degree in Computer Networking Technology. I'm 27, I had tried going to college straight out of high school but was more interested in playing around. I worked a few low-level local jobs like pizza delivery and retail before going to a call center. When the call center ended up closing and I was put on unemployment I took full advantage of the opportunity to go back and finish college.

While taking classes, I was recommend to apply at the college for their webmaster position when the last person had to leave. I got the job and worked there while finishing my degree, and I am still there now. It's a good job with a good rate of pay but only 20 hours a week. It's a small college and I'm the only person working on the website, there's virtually no chance I'll ever get moved up to 40 hours a week. I'm relatively comfortable at the moment because I live with family, I have all my bills covered with a little extra to spend, but there's no room to really start saving and I'm eager to do more.

I'm not really sure where to begin, though. As I mentioned before I live in an extremely rural area. I've asked my networking professor about job opportunities in the area but there's only a couple of places and both of those involve starting out in a call center/help desk. I'm very open to moving but that seems difficult without having some savings built up.

Here's some more specific details:

Associate's in Computer Networking.  

No certifications yet, I plan to take the CCNA but need to refresh since I've been out of classes for a year. I've considered looking into A+ and some Microsoft certifications as well if they will help.  

In addition to my Networking degree I have some skill in Access(took a class at the college) and I've signed up to take online courses in PHP, CSS3, and HTML5 this summer.

I have close to 2 years experience now as a Web Developer at the college, but to tell the truth the job is very basic. 95% of the job has been editing HTML with a little bit of PHP which I mostly copy-paste-edit from existing code. I've did a little bit of independent work as well with the web developer who worked there before me(he has his own local company which does website design/hosting.)

The independent work I did with him has made me fall in love with the thought of doing freelance work. I've had that in mind when signing up for the PHP/CSS3/HTML5 intro and intermediate courses this summer but I don't know how reliable that is. I know I can do editing/upkeep but I'm unsure how strong or weak I am in design.

I'm not against going back to college and getting a 4-year degree, but I feel it would be quite difficult for me at this time. I've exhausted most of my financial aid and I read horror stories all the time on here about student loans. The college I go to/work at is a 2-year community college so I can't finish there and I don't think they would be willing to pay for me to attend another college.


I know that's a lot to read, but hopefully it helps relate the position I'm in. I feel a little like a goldfish in a small bowl who is interested in going out into the ocean but has no idea what's out there. Thanks!

My career in IT is a solid 15 years, mostly regarding MS centric business systems, data center ops, etc.

A couple years ago, 2.5, I got the opportunity to join an emerging company operating online media promotion as their technology manager. I saw it as a chance to move up as well as being potentially lucrative, as I would get a cut of profits which, at the time, were significant.

The market they are in shifted and they were not properly diversified in revenue streams. As a result the company appears to be sliding.

I have been looking in my traditional roles, but I am getting a lot of negative feedback on the lack of recent work in the role, despite several technical interviews that went really well.

I am not opposed to continuing in management, but I have no direct reports and I am concerned the company I work for looks a little odd on the surface (no, not porn), although so far it hasn't been mentioned. Also, there's really no comparable role in most companies.

Here is the company, [312 Marketing](http://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-312-Marketing-EI_IE610408.11,24.htm), on Glassdoor. I read the reviews and someone mentioned cydcor and door-to-door sales so I talked to HR and they knew nothing about it and said it was misinformation. I guess we'll see. 

They said they have big clients, ie AT&amp;T and are privately owned, and are looking to build their client list and hire people to train and develop from within before expanding. Seems like a good opportunity to get good training and be a part of a company that could be pretty successful soon. Anything I should look out for during the interview/while following someone around to see what they do to know if its a scam/multi-level marketing?

2) The other job is Loss Prevention Agent with [Nordstrom Rack](http://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Nordstrom-Rack-EI_IE587559.11,25.htm), since Im a certified LEO but didnt like being a patrol officer and have a bit of LP experience already, I feel like I have a good chance of getting the job. 

Ideally Id want to move to the nearby Nordstrom (not Rack) ASAP and/or be promoted to lead agent, etc. to make more, since the job pays around $11-15 at the Rack vs $12-20 at the full store. Honestly, Im not really that excited about being in another risky position like this, but it is more of a sure thing since its a big established company.

What do you guys think? I may not get either job offer or I may get both, I just need some help deciding should I get both. It seems like Im pulling more for the Marketing job just for my safety, but it does have more financial risks because it's difficult to find out much about such a small company.

And perhaps the most important tip - don't give up. The worst they can say is no. And if they do, oh well. Move on.",,False,self,t5_2uagc,False,,,True,t3_wv18x,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/wv18x/advice/,
1376798334.0,1,self.GetEmployed,1kl771,Question regarding piercings and an INTERNAL interview,1,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1kl771/question_regarding_piercings_and_an_internal/,"My employer is doing internal interviews for about a dozen positions right now. 

The people who are conducting the interviews all know I have tattoos and piercings. The tattoos  are easily hidden by normal clothing as are all piercings except ear lobes and a very simple nostril piercing where I have a plain ring. Our dress code is business casual except I work overnights (and the positions are also overnight) so it's even more relaxed.

 For example, I wear jeans or capris, t-shirts (either solid colors or something non-offensive such as Snoopy) and flip flops right now. As soon as I get to work, I kick the flip flops off and run around barefoot. Other coworkers also run around barefoot so that is not an issue. During the winter I run around in my socks. When I started there was one girl there who had two full sleeve tattoos who always wore short sleeves. She is no longer there as she was just picking up shifts on a temporary basis. My immediate supervisors wear jeans, their sup does the same and his director does, too. 

I do not have any face-to-face contact with our clients as all interactions are by phone, fax or email with the exception of the period in which we pick up new clients and we have I implemention teams on site (of which I do not have a role in). 

The company is laid back to the point that they served wine during our Christmas event DURING the work day and margaritas and tequila for Cinco de Mayo. 

I only ask this because I recently had this piercing done for the third time and I don't want to lose it again. I lost it once for a surgical procedure when it was several months old and I had to remove it so I know I will lose it again. I don't think that a simple diamond would make much of a difference compared to the hoop during the interview process.

Opinions? Advice?

Biology) a couple years ago and had full intentions of continuing my education and becoming a Physician Assistant. Things have changed and I am now feeling the burnout of working with patients, families and not working due to low hospital numbers. I do not want to walk away forever but I need a break. I am one of the lowest on the healthcare totem pole (with no possible advancement) even though I have a degree and multiple years of experience above my current position. I do not really want to go back to school but will consider it, if it is the final option.

I have had a interest with computers since I was little, my brother has degrees in computer programming and maintenance. I did some computer programming and maintenance courses in high school and college. I am very good with hardware and software alike and was an Easy Tech at Staples when that first launched. I would like to get back into the computer/ IT job circuit but with the little experience and length of time that has gone by, from my last computer related job, I am at a clear disadvantage.

I need some help...
Is it worth trying to find a entry level position and trying to move up or should I just give up on the computer/ IT field? What possible options do I have?

- *May 2012* Graduated with BS Chemical Engineering
- *June 2012* Left for Peace Corps 2 year assignment with intention of grad school / job afterwards
- *October 2012* Sent home for surgery on my ankle due to injury in Africa
- *November 2012 - March 2013* Worked a series of part time low wage jobs while trying to find work that would be flexible with my surgery in April and my inability to carry objects / walk long distance. No luck.
- *April 2013* Had ankle surgery finally. Started a $13/hour internship (ugh) at a regional planning non-profit, enrolled in graduate school this fall (environmental engineering)

I am basically just trying to get by. My resume is great - I have ample experience, several internships under my belt, and I am a very resiliant guy. I was in Peace Corps Liberia eating dirt and pooping in a hole. I have a chemical engineering degree and I am a smart guy.

So that's the background: Here's the question.

I am hoping to find a full-time job with big-boy pay still. I won't be able to walk without crutches until July. But! I found an opening at an environmental consulting group which has hired people with far less experience than me (one of them being my friend). I enthusiasticly applied on their website, on my college's alumni job board, cold-emailed some HR folks... no response. 

My friend forwarded my resume, chatted with me online, and said

&gt;Hi FriendlyTrashMan, it turns out ____ office will interview candidates on June 4th. My manager mentioned they will try to schedule you interview on the same day if possible. Just want to give you a heads up. Best of luck!

I haven't heard anything back yet - June 4th is less than a week away. I really want to talk to someone there and ask about it.

Do I call them? Email someone from their website? Just wait by my phone impatiently? I would drop my internship (which pays less and is not in my area of interest - but is 100% better than no job or a call center, as far as my resume is concerned) and take evening classes at grad school if I could. Job in my field + 2X pay &gt; what I am doing. I really want this job. It feels within reach. If I can get that interview, I am confident I can get that job.

Any advice on where to go from here? Should I just keep waiting - I have only been at my new job for not-even two months. I put it on my resume so that it didn't look like I was slacking for 8 months. 

The lack of contact after reaching out to them in 5 different ways is killing me!",,False,self,t5_2uagc,False,,,True,t3_1faa8y,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1faa8y/advice_needed_on_calling_employer_career_advice/,

Just looking for some advice regarding jobs/careers.

I am 22, recent college grad and am currently working with a Digital Ad Co. in LA. I've been there about 4 months now, and am starting to not enjoy what I am doing. I'm not planning to bail out anytime soon (and i think it might even be best to wait a year/ a little over 6months before switching to another job).

I am a campaign analyst/account coordinator for the company and, for the most part, I work with excel sheets all day long. I graduated with a BA in Economics with a lot of experience with entertainment companies.

Now, to give a little insight of myself, Overall I""m an introvert - love literature, films, books....prefer to work alone and to figure things out on my own. I consider myself better with writing than trying to talk...if that makes sense. My job right now is pretty chill...as i work in front of a computer all day I don't really need to interact with my boss that much aside via email.

But, i'm starting to feel absolutely no passion for what I do...not even enjoyment from my job. I'm able to use headphones at work and I look forward to putting my headphones in and not having to chit chat with my boss on how my/his weekend was etc... (it's a small company with multiple offices in the US...the office I work in is just me and my boss so i have virtually no social interaction with anyone else)...everyday my boss keeps reminding me that I need to be ""chasing the money"" and that for me to do better in the companies eye I need to help them make more money. I get it, it's a business, it's all about making more and more money. 

But, I hate it...i'm not saying that making money is a bad thing...but when I'm at work i don't feel as though I""m contributing to anything that I want to...I like working with people/understanding people...I like observing people and trying to figure out why someone is how they are...or what choices they make and why (ie Behavioral Economics in a way)....

essentially...malcom gladwell related.

any thoughts of what I could start to either teach myself or look into as far as trying to branch into another industry that might have more of an impact on what I am able to do and ultimately help with a company?

First of all I'm English, so bear that in mind please.

I did my NVQ lvl 2 in Catering and Hospitality (17) and decided that this would be the Career for me. Over the years ive worked at a few different place, running a kitchen and doing management training in one pub that i worked at.
  
I'm 24 now and Engaged, and really don't like catering anymore, I've been thinking of moving into a job that's more 9-5 so i can spend more time with my partner and think about starting a family one day. I really don't want to be doing the hours that catering usually has you do when we start thinking about kids.
  
So what I'm looking for is either any advice on what jobs you think i could do with the typical experience that i would of gained. Or maybe a story that you or someone you know has gone through when changing careers.
  
I have worked in a Privately owned Vintage Toy shop in the past, so i do have some experience in retail, and selling things to people that they don't actually want or need.
  
One of my biggest interests is in gaming, and i know how immature and unfeasible that sounds and the chances of making a career out of it, either making, playing or casting games is very slim to none. So I'm not really considering that.

1376423156.0,0,self.GetEmployed,1karyj,How can you start building a network?,1,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1karyj/how_can_you_start_building_a_network/,"I've answered this question a few times here in the last week, so I thought I'd put all my answers into one place,

First, let's admit that networking can be uncomfortable and might feel a little like brown-nosing.  You've got to get over that quickly and understand that networking is how work gets done.

In my industry (wine &amp; spirits), I've had about 10 roles in 25 years, and I've gotten *every single one of them through networking*.  I've never gotten a job through a want-ad or board posting.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen that way, but networking is so much more effective.

So how can you start building a network if you don't have one, or if all your peers are straight out of college or unemployed?

1.  **Start with who you know.**  your IRL network.  This would include friends, neighbors, teachers, clergy, doctor and dentists, etc.  Basically anyone with a number of friends and colleagues or that are gainfully employed.  [Here's a place to start if you aren't sure how to do it](http://www.jobbankusa.com/CareerArticles/Networking/Developing_A_Networking_Contact_List.html)

2.  **Join LinkedIn groups.**  Don't just sit there and wait for people to invite you in - go find them.  Start with groups.  You can join up to 50, and once you're in, you can connect with just about anybody in the group. Target groups that are a mix of your locale or in your desired career field.   Look for groups with large, active memberships.

3.  **Use Advanced Search on LinkedIn.**  Using the Advanced Search screen, look for contacts near you or with something else in common (keywords, school, etc.) and invite them to connect.  If you can't invite them directly, use the Get Introduced feature.  [Here's how to do it if you're unsure](http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1959)

4.  **Expand your professional circle.** Look for a leadership role in a local charity or civic group. If you're unemployed, you've likely got some free time (start by getting off reddit more often!).  Don't settle for a entry-level volunteer role, but shoot for a role with some responsibility.  This will look great on your resume and will help you meet more people.

5.  **Get out of the house!**  Your absolutel best chance to get hired is by hanging around with people who already work where you want to work.  Are there any conventiions nearby?  Sign up to be a volunteer.  Typically if you work for a day handing out brochures or something they'll credential you for the rest of the convention.  Are there meetups going on?  Are there big offices?  If so, hang out at the Starbucks nearby and try to meet some people.

6.  **Have the right tools for the job.**  Handing your contacts a resume is not effective, because your resume should be targeted to each specific role you are applying for.  Instead, hand out a [Networking Biography](http://theakelley.com/a-networking-bio-why-use-one/#sthash.k4Eh0z2H.dpbs) which is a much more effective tool to allow others to help you.

Now, get off reddit and get out there and build your network!",,False,self,t5_2uagc,False,,,True,t3_1karyj,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1karyj/how_can_you_start_building_a_network/,

I'm Andrew Sambrook, and I'm looking to work for a few years, so that I'm able to save money for things that I want, learn new skills in psychology, and make more friends in the world. 

I'm looking for work that is going to help me as a professional and as a learner. 

Therefore, I'm most interested in any: 

+ Volunteer Work
+ Internships, unpaid or paid, part-time or full-time
+ Employment, part-time or full-time, permanent

I believe that my three strongest skills are 1) my ability to learn new things, 2) my ability to write professional pieces of writing, and 3) my ability to talk honestly, willingly, and positively with the people I work with. 

I thought that I'd send my résumé to share some more information about the person that I am and what I'd be able to do for the [Association].

I started work when i was 16 as a lifeguard and then worked various food service jobs until I was 20. During this time I also attended school to become a certified medical assistant and acquired 33 credits before running out of money. (I paid for school myself at a community college)

When I was 20 I was hired by a steel company as a helper and member of the 612 iron workers union. Within a week I had demonstrated my ability to learn new things and was put in the apprenticeship program to be a fitter. I left this job when I was 22 after 30 months.
Also during that time I played in a band which managed to record about 3 albums and engage on a handful of small tours. As I stopped playing in a band I started learning Mixed martial arts at a local gym which I will explain why it is important later.

When I was 22 I started work for New York state in a rehabilitation center for developmentally disabled individuals with forensic issues. (pedophilia, arson, murder, rape ect). I have worked for over 5 years at this job, writing legal observations of patients treatments and progress. I am also responsible for administering medication and for months of future medicine. I routinely have had to talk down individuals with weapons and engage in physical interventions when violent situations arise.

I also have been working part time as an instructor at the mixed martial arts gym. After 3 years and a few fights I reached my coaching rank and was hired as an instructor. I am responsible for planning lessons, teaching and ensuring students safety at the gym.

I'm 24, made a huge mistake when I was 19. I ended up taking a plea bargain for two counts of misdemeanor assault on a female instead of 3 felonies that have not been expunged yet. The felonies are 2nd degree kidnapping, 2nd degree forcible rape, and 2nd degree sexual assault. I wasn't put on the sex offender registry, nor did my case cross paths with a domestic magistrate.  
  
I completed probation and all that was required of me without any problems. I've also been doing a lot of volunteer community service work to try and show that I'm not the scum of the earth while working in the construction business. I know that the crimes I was charged/convicted with are very serious and I am seen as a terrible person. However, I've been doing my best to give back, make myself and life better.  
  
I was in college for computer networking yet I lost all of my financial aid when I dropped out due to my arrest. I barely clear $600 a month and I need to find a second job. Every interview I go to I'm well dressed, usually button down collar shirt, tie, and black slacks. I do my best not to over sell myself and be well mannered. All the interviews I go to go great until my background becomes the topic of discussion. After explaining in short detail attitudes change towards me and ultimately I do not receive a call back.  
  
I understand the choices I've made landed me in the position that I'm in, yet I want to do something I excel at and will be happy with. I expect a lot of hate after I explain what I've done in the past and I understand it. I'd just like to move forward with my life and I'm unsure what I'm doing wrong when it comes to getting a job.

All I'm looking for is a terrible minimum wage job of any kind. People on reddit have been pretty douchey with the ideas of ""You're asking too much"" or ""You're being too picky."" I'm not. I've applied everywhere and I'm pretty sure it's illegal for me to ask for less than $7.40 in my state.

I don't have a car. Or a license. I don't have friends to teach me how to drive and it costs about $65 an hour for the driver's training place to take me out driving.

I don't really have any nice clothes anymore. I've been out here a year looking for work. Since August 2011 actually. 

I've applied to every business in my town that doesn't require a ton of college time. McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Walmart, Meijer, Kroger, Walgreens, Rite Aide, all of the car dealerships, all of the body shops, all of the tech stores, all of the gas stations. Asked for minimum wage on all of them.

I call them a few days after each app. Either that or I go back in person. I usually follow up by phone or in person at least once a week. No matter where the job is. I always make sure I talk to as many managers as I can.

I can't go to college due to various reasons. I don't really feel like getting into that right now. I've done a lot of research on it. Just take it to be not an option for this.

I'm not sure what else I need to cover here...Just let me know if you need more information. Besides the specific town, of course lol.

I just need some help. I figured this would be the sub to do it in. thanks in advance.",,False,self,t5_2uagc,False,,,True,t3_1a3drz,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1a3drz/so_ive_tried_pretty_much_everything_i_have_no/,

I'm looking for a little advice. To begin, I'll give you some background information. I graduated in 2002 and joined the Air Force. While I was in, I worked on Radar Jamming Pods and their Test Stations. I was young and it was my first time away from home, so I didn't pursue my Associates like I should have. I was Honorably Discharged in 2006 and I moved back home.

January 2007, I enrolled in the local community college and started an AAS in Biotechnology. I gave up on that, changed my major, and instead, graduated with an AAS in Electronics Engineering Technologies in May 2010. I looked for work in my field, but ended up as a Shipping Supervisor for a bakery in October 2010. I'm still here.

What I'm looking for is direction...I want to work in a field relating to computers. I've put off getting any Comptia Certs, because I don't know if they're worth the effort / money. I just withdrew from CTU's Online program, due to time constraints and a lack of instruction from the courses I was taking. I did take a Web Design course during my time there and I enjoyed it.

Should I try and obtain a second AAS? A Bachelor's degree program is likely out of my reach, due to work and money.

I'm including my resume for any pointers you may have.

Thanks in advance; sorry for the wall of text.

How do I best represent myself in this situation (on my resume, in interviews, etc.)?

Please feel free to give me general advice on handling going from business owner to employee. Anything is appreciated! 

If you want to get more specific:
I am interested in the areas of marketing, business development, and management. I cannot say I have a lot of experience in these areas. I thought owning a business would allow me this opportunity to gain experience, but it worked out that I did more technical things and not as much of the marketing, development, business growth, etc. that I intended. I have done some of all of that, but the business is only 2 years old and I don't think that's a lot of experience, or enough to find a job in those fields. I also do not have any formal training/education in those areas (I am planning to do this but need to get some sort of job/income first). What kind of job do you think I could get, with my age and education/experience? Any advice on what some different options are (one thing I thought of was getting a ""just a job"" and working on my education and freelancing on the side)?

Any questions feel free to ask.

I'm 24, I live in the UK. I have a degree in Film and Television Production. It taught me a lot about:

* organising and managing projects, including handling growth and backup plans,
* effectively finding creative solutions within rigorously structured work,
* applying existing technical skills effectively,
* how to brilliantly communicate both within a team and to external personnel,
* relying on myself and rapidly teaching myself the necessary skills to complete all kinds of different jobs, and
* how much sleep I could actually go without.

I regret it. Although I know the course did those things for me, the world and his wife thinks I played with a camera for three years and made zombie movies (I made no zombie movies).

For the last twenty months, I'd been working in an office for Oil &amp; Gas engineering. I was hired as a Document Controller and P.A. to the Office Manager. Pretty soon I was also managing the daily running of the office, providing first-line local IT support and administrating engineering projects. I became the single office contact for both the IT dept. and office facilities. I:

* troubleshooted all the hardware in the office inc. printer/scanners, projectors and displays,
* solved basic IT issues for our team, and tutored them when they had difficulties using their software,
* organised with external departments personnel hiring/leaving and filled in the forms for the Office Manager to sign,
* organised personnel travel,
* co-ordinated two office moves,
* bought furniture and stationery for the office,
* kept track of project progress and produced reports for external management,
* regularly checked the office was up to HSE standard and trained as the office's fire warden, and
* typed the Office Manager's emails and reports.

The O.M. was in his mid-sixties, was from an era that had a ""typing pool,"" frankly didn't give a shit any more and was happy to let me do his job. I was fine with that -- I was well-organised so my job wasn't stressful, but I was still challenged from every angle. That sounds real bullshitty, but it's completely true.

Why did I leave? Well, the O.M. wasn't getting any work in for the office. I was only ""on the books"" as the Document Controller he hired me as -- he made sure I did all the extra work ""unofficially."" Upper Management sent him an email one day that said if there was no work, there were no documents. He couldn't justify keeping me on without making himself look incompetent. And that was it -- I was redundant.

Before that job, I was a duty manager in a busy city-centre bar/restaurant and worked in retail in beers, wines and spirits (there isn't a ""best"" scotch, each gin has its own nuances and I feel steak goes best with *dry* stouts that aren't too hopped).

What do I want to do with my life? I'll be honest, I'd still like to write and/or make movies. I'm also a cracking musician and songwriter and could carve my path that way.

**Those things don't pay the next bill that comes through the door.** Not yet, any way. Until they start making enough money that I could live off them -- I need another job.

My predicament is that I feel I have plenty of great personal skills, and have demonstrated them in my education and work. However, my work constitutes one arty-farty degree, one bar management position and twenty months of office management and admin and IT support, without being an office manager. I feel lost.

Where do I go from here, reddit? Do you have an hints for my CV? Do you have any avenues I might not have thought about?

Specific questions:

* If they sent me the official offer letter via email (not the OFFICIAL official one, just a copy of it), is it appropriate to negotiate via email? They also briefed me on the offer via phone beforehand as well.
* What is appropriate to negotiate for? Is title usually off the table? I joked to my wife that I should ask for a personal laptop, but that seems a little silly.
*  How long is too long to think about an offer? I'm thinking 48 hours is a little long, but both companies have happily agreed to that timetable.

I'm going to be fairly detailed in my explanation, because, though I feel I tried to handle this as best as I could given the circumstances, I'd like to learn how I might have done better, especially from the perspective of an employer (if any of those hang out on here), so that in a similar event, my response will be more reflexive and my calculus clearer.

First, the job is 'night shift baker' of the fast-food variety, involving work with food, ovens, stovetops, boiling water, knives, and essentially non-stop multitasking.

My trainer was an experienced baker (5 years). Normally, there is only one baker on the shift, so I had complete confidence that she would be able to handle it on her own, and that my presence would be an increased risk to the operation.

My mind state was foggy and my awareness would cut in and out. By the time I got to work, I was nearly convinced that my insomnia was due to caffeine withdrawal (I dramatically reduced coffee intake over the previous days to try to, ironically, get better sleep during the daytime, between shifts). I did not drink coffee because, if it was caffeine withdrawal, there was a good chance that coffee would have an inverse effect and incapacitate me completely. When my trainer ended up being 30 minutes late, I started what I could recall from the bake procedure I learned the night before, and asked the storefront staff to make me a medium black coffee, thinking I would try my luck as a last resort.

Of course, my mental calculus at the time was not the most nuanced, but the salient worry was the risk imposed by creating a volatile environment, both in terms of food safety and work safety. I would also certainly be incompetent as a trainee, having both my working memory and retention compromised significantly.

When my trainer showed up, about 30 minutes into the shift, I had already made the decision to leave, based on my very erratic performance, even though I was already dreading the personal repercussions, and extremely disappointed (irrationally so given my mindstate) that I couldn't come up with more creative solution. (The one thing that calmed me down was how ''Carry on My Wayward Son'' spanned the short drive home, playing on the radio in the car that my dad was driving, who displayed obvious contempt at my decision.)

I know I could have handled this better in a more lucid state, but I'd like to know your opinion on just how this would have been handled most professionally for the benefit of all involved.",,False,self,t5_2uagc,False,,,True,t3_115ieh,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/115ieh/wisdom_request_trainee_dumped_over_insomnia/,
