###About
___
&gt;The [Minimal MIUI Go Apex Theme](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.go.launcherex.theme.kxnt.miui&amp;hl=en) is currently developed and maintained for the Android OS by /u/Kxnt. With his permission, I have ported *some* of that work over to iOS. That being said, if you choose to use this theme, please **support the author** and [buy the theme](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.go.launcherex.theme.kxnt.miui&amp;hl=en) from the Google Play store. Although it's for Android, you can still use the resources to port over additional icons to iOS for your own personal use (plus, you get that warm and fuzzy feeling for doing the right thing).

###Installation
---
&gt;I've packaged the theme and put it on my personal repository. This is a /r/iOSthemes exclusive, I will not be putting it on any public repositories. To install, simply add the following repo to Cydia: `http://usefulidiot.org/repo/`

###Comments
---
&gt;If after [buying the original theme](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.go.launcherex.theme.kxnt.miui&amp;hl=en) to support the author you're still feeling generous, may I humbly suggest a cause close to my heart, the [Children's Neuroblastoma Cancer Foundation](http://www.cncfhope.org/Donations).

Hey all! As my original post seemed to have a positive reception from the community, here's the survey for /r/iOSthemes' favorite themes.

---

Just like with [/r/jailbreak's favorite tweaks of 2012](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/166ym9/rjailbreaks_favorite_tweaks_of_2012/), there are some rules that need to be followed for this to be successful and useable in the future.

**Posting/Commenting Guidelines:**

* Double check before posting that your theme has not already been added.
* **One** theme per comment. **Please include a screenshot** of or link to the theme. If it's on Cydia and is paid, please include the repo and price. f you're unsure of where a theme can be found or got it from a pirate repo, please don't post. The majority of lockscreen and UI themes can be found on DeviantArt and iThemeSky both of which are linked in the sidebar. iOS version and device compatibility would be nice, but is not required.

 Examples:

 &gt; [**LS Nimbus**](http://technouse.deviantart.com/art/LS-Nimbus-190421722) - DeviantArt, free, not updated for iOS 6, HD + SD compatible

 or 

 &gt; [**Glasklart**](http://www.maxthemes.com/weblinks/GKHD-0-Photo.jpg) - ModMyi, free, HD &amp; SD versions available

* **Upvote** themes you like. If you dislike the theme, **comment explaining why instead of downvoting**. Downvoting does no good and defeats the purpose of having a poll in the first place.
* **Be sure to put the theme in the correct category.** Direct replies to this post will be removed. There will also be a comment for general discussion.
* **Please limit your nominations to 3 per category** (give others a chance!).
* In order to be as thorough as possible, please include any theme you can think of. I'd like for people looking at this several months from now to be able to see and choose from a wide variety of themes


^**TL;DR**: ^Search ^first, ^one ^theme ^per ^comment, ^upvote, ^categories, ^discuss, ^share

Here is my new LS, Peekly.
[Go get it!](http://studiographic.ca/peekly/) It's **FREE** *(but donations would be nice because I put a lot of work into it!)*

It's kind of an open beta right now, want to make sure it works properly across devices. If you find any issues, take screenshots and post them here and I will try fix them! 


Thanks, S

**EDIT**

Well, looks like 9to5mac.com and Gizmodo caught wind of Peekly, and sent a little more traffic than I was expecting my way! My bandwidth was exceeded but it's fixed now. Sorry for any inconvenience. Seems like the internet has a love/hate relationship with Peekly. I've gotten a lot of good feedback so far. I'll be making some tweaks then onto Cydia it goes (it will remain free). Thanks for all the comments!

It's purpose is to have a centralized place where most tweaks released in a given month can be found for those who maybe don't have the time to browse the Changes section of Cydia and also for future reference. 

Last month, I decided to try including a Themes released section (there were only two I included). Since we now have /r/iOSthemes, what would the community want:

1. Keep the themes released in the same post as tweaks released on /r/jailbreak. 
2. Make a second post in /r/iOSthemes for the themes released that month. 

Right now, I'm leaning towards two separate posts, but I just wanted to gauge community interest before doing so.

**Edit:** Judging by the upvotes and the lack of a comment requesting option 1, I'll be making a separate post in /r/iOSthemes. Expect it on the 27th/28th/1st depending on your time zone. These last two days have seen the release of a few high quality themes, so I'm pretty excited for this post, especially because it'll hopefully bring some variety to screenshots in /r/iOSthemes, something we're definitely lacking. You can expect the same quality of post as my previous round ups, so I will be including full sources for everything that I list.

In this update not only did I include new icons (**over 200!**) but I’ve changed the way FlatIcons works to be more efficient, and added new themes!
Both FlatIconsSquaredLarge and FlatIconsSquared are now modification themes. This means that “FlatIcons” should ALWAYS be enabled. “FlatIconsSquared” or “FlatIconsSquaredLarge” should then be activated above it if desired, to achieve the desired look.
This change was implemented to save file space and remove redundant files.

**FlatAuxo is here!** Now you get a flattened Auxo theme with FlatIcons. Just choose to enable either “FlatAuxo” or “FlatAuxoDark” in Winterboard, and enjoy!

**Introducing FlatWeather!** When enabled, this will theme the weather icons in the stock Apple notification centre weather widget, weather app, and siri, as well as flattening the ENTIRE stock weather app!

There's lots of changes, improvements and more - make sure to read the full release notes in Cydia, or on my website: [flaticonsios.com](http://flaticonsios.com)

Edit: If anyone notices icons that are supposed to be themed but aren't working, please let me know via my website or email flaticons.ios@gmail.com, and I'll fix them in v1.2a!

Here's a couple screenshots of the additions:

There are probably a few ways to do this, but here is what I did: buy the biteLiquid theme and replace the qc texture image in the theme folder with the one linked here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/0uq69vmmbg1e4ri/qc-texture%402x.zip
I also changed the qr background color value in the info.plist to be #ffffff01 but I'm not sure if that was necessary. I left the text entry field opaque for the sake of readability, but you could probably make that transparent as well. Anyway, make the changes and reapply the theme and there you go. For the record, I don't think this looks that great in most instances--it's nice on a plain background, but on your homescreen or anything else with a busy background it will get pretty hard to read.

First off, I just want to thank everyone for the amazing response that I've gotten to FlatIcons for iPhone 4/4s/5. 

I've been working hard to get this ready for release, and I think it's ready - over 250 hand drawn FlatIcons to some of the most popular apps (including ALL of the requests that I received through Reddit!)

Also, due to popular demand I have made FlatIconsSquared, an option that will be bundled along with the original, featuring square icons.

Here's a small album of sample screenshots, including previews of both sets: http://imgur.com/a/Y5CY4

And now for the bad news - for this icon theme to really shine, it's got to be a paid theme - I'm aiming for either 0.99, or 1.99. I want this to be a theme that's fully supported, with request fulfillment and frequent updates.

This in itself isn't terrible news, but here's the problem I've run into: modmyi has rejected my submission for a paid theme because it ""doesn't look professional enough"". 

I could release it as a free set, but there's no way I could afford to spend every night fulfilling requests and making new icons for free. In essence, the theme would be D.O.A. Making my own repo isn't really an option, as I wouldn't get the necessary exposure, and I have no programming skills to keep it functioning properly.

If anyone has any suggestions as to how I can make this work, I'd really appreciate it!

Edit: Here is a list of all the apps I've got in v1.0. Let me know if you have any requests, send an email to flaticons.ios@gmail.com

New to the team are Max Katzmann (creator of the great JellyLock) and Bryce Dougherty (creator of the awesome tweak TapTapPass). We've all put a lot of work into this project, and we are ready to show you what we've come up with! 

Check out the video here:
http://vimeo.com/64430875

We've added new clocks and weather icons, and as it was one of the most requested features, you now have the ability to remove the second page! 

The app is a beautiful way to set up Peekly. You can change all the settings, update your ""peek"", and choose images from your photo library to use as wallpapers. You can even crop the images to fit. No re-springs required!  

Peekly (the lockscreen) as always will remain free (full featured). You can still control Peekly with the settings.js file.

The app however will cost a buck ($0.99). Please support devs as we spend a lot of time building these cool toys for you, and put a lot of time into support and adding new features. 

Peekly and the app will be available from Cydia soon. If you are interested in beta testing please PM me.

1. When posting a theme, try and include as much info possible about what you've shown in the screenshots. (Wallpaper, Tweaks, Theme, Repos used, Etc)

2. If you have a question or problem with a theme, please do your best to see if it has already been answered/solved. There is a search bar to the upper right for those who didn't know ;-)

Bloom HD - I'm using the Icons from this theme.
Colorgasm HD - This theme is to change the Wifi and Signal bars 
Newport - To add the silver line around the folder 
ayecon - 2x2 Folders Layout ON

As you can see I use 4 themes so your going to have to do a lot of playing around in iFile to delete the files that 
you don't want.

My LockScreen is a HTML LockScreen so I have problems viewing my notifications but there should be a fix soon.

Folder background and App Switcher background -

SSH/iFile into your iPhone Device/System/Library/CoreServices/Spirinboard.app
Find the file named FolderSwitcherBG-568h@2x~iphone.png and delete or keep a back up of this. Once you have found 
the image you want rename that image to FolderSwitcherBG-568h@2x~iphone.png Respring or Reboot and it should be changed.
I had a few problems with this with some pictures not changing and sticking with the stock background.

NOTE: On a lot of these themes, you may not be able to view the notifications, this is not the theme's fault, it's winterboard. Fix should be soon.

Oh, I suggest you browsing this on a desktop.. It will be much easier.

I might also help with LockScreen themes, Dock Themes, Status Bar themes, Phone Dialer/Calculator/Calendar/etc. themes, but that's a different episode...

**Step by step guide:**

Tools you'll need:

*On your computer:* Phoshop/Gimp/Pixlr, WinSCP/CyberDuck/TotalCommander
*On your iDevice:* iFile, IconThief/AppInfo, Winterboard *(duh)*

**Creating the theme folder heirarchy**
Make a folder on your desktop or in your work folder named ##.theme (where ## is whatever you want it to show up as in winterboard.) Inside that folder, make a folder named Bundles. This is where you'll be saving all your icons when you're done

**Find app identifiers and icon names**
The easiest way to do this is to use Icon Thief. It automatically makes a zip with all the icons for all your apps in it, organized into app identifier folders. But Icon Thief occasionally misses icons, so you'll want to grab icons for those apps the hard way:

Use SBSettings or Appinfo to find the app folder for each app. Use iFile to look in that folder and navigate to its [appnamegoeshere].app folder; from here look inside that folder for info.plist - View it in a text viewer to find the app identifier (looks like com.developer.appname) - Next, you'll want to hunt for icons. In the folder you're currently in, look for any images that are the following sizes, and copy them over to your computer, inside a folder with the same name as the app identifier for the app [com.developer.app] - Put these app identifier folders inside the Bundles folder you created earlier.

*[Icon Sizes: 144x144, 114x114, 100x100, 72x72, 58x58, 57x57, 50x50, 40x40, 29x29 (For system icons, the sizes are just a few pixels larger, 118x120, 59x60, etc.)]*

If you want to theme the icons for jailbreak tweaks that only appear in your settings app, you'll also need to look in System/Library/Preference Bundles for those tweaks.

**Creating your icons**
Go into your bundle identifier folders and look at the sizes of icons that you have to make, and create icons for every single size needed. Make sure to name them exactly the same as the original icon names for each app bundle. (The names are case specific, so be precise. Some icons need to be icon-50.png, some are Icon-50.png - *Make sure you have them all **exactly** right*)

*[Make sure that your icons' logos are uniform in the amount of space that they take up. If you're planning on keeping the stock iOS icon shape and size, make sure that you fill the entire image with background color, but don't let your main logo go outside of the 'safe' area in the corners of the image, as iOS will round the corners off. If you're planning on changing the shape/size of the icons, make sure to read the part about transparencies coming up.]*

**Transparencies/Masks**
If a theme has transparent areas around the icons, you'll need to fix the way iOS handles transparencies. Make a new image that's 0x0 pixels and save it (the best way to do this is to make a blank text document and rename the extension to .png) Name it AppIconMask@2x~iPhone.png - put this in a folder named com.apple.mobileicons.framework.

You will also need to do this with about 10 other images. Look in /System/Library/Private Frameworks/Mobile Icons.framework and get the names of the images with shadow/mask/outline/overlay in them. You'll want to make blank files for all of them and put them in that folder you made.

Do the same with the images in System/Library/Core Services/SpringBoard.app that have shadow/outline/mask/overlay in the title (unless they have 'folder' in the title. That will make your folder icons invisible if you do that.) Put all these blank files that you properly renamed into a folder named com.apple.springboard

*[Mask files determine the shape of the icons, as in what gets cut out, and these are your culprits for dark squares around your small/transparent icons; Shadow files create the dark square when you click on the icon; Overlay files create the 'shiny' texture over some apps; Outline files create square outlines (only applies to notification center and folder icons)]*

If you want to change the shape or size of the icons (like 266 or MIUI do) you'll need each of these images to be edited so that only the shape/size you want are filled out. For the Mask files, that means the white part, still surrounded by black until the edges.

**File transfer**
You can either use an SSH tool like Cyberduck or WinSCP to move your theme, or a wired tool like TotalCommander with TPOT installed.

If using SSH, your phone needs some kind of SSH installed on it from CYDIA and needs to be on the same wifi as your computer. Connect via  SSH to your phone's IP (found in wifi settings) and use the user:pass root:alpine

If using Total Commander with TPOT, just navigate to network neighborhood/Tpot

Move the ##.theme folder you've been working out of into your phone and place it in Library/Themes

Enable it in Winterboard and you should be good. But be prepared to troubleshoot missing icons or black squares around the icons if you made them transparent.

This whole process should take about 1-3 days of work if you're porting an already existing icon set, and 3-6 weeks of work if you're making them from scratch, depending on how fast you are, and how many icons you plan on making. (Trouble shooting will add quite a bit of time to that, as well.)

If you want to make a full theme for release on Cydia, I highly recommend asking people to send you IconThief .zips and making any icons you can. The more icons you have at release, the better.

---------------------

If that seems like too much work for just simply changing some icons, now you understand why themers charge up to $4 for a theme.",,False,self,t5_2w997,1368573979.0,,,True,t3_1eciuy,http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/1eciuy/a_quick_icon_theming_guide_aka_read_this_before/,

I love this theme, but until I hear back from the creator and this issue gets fixed, I would stay away. I'm hoping I don't have to restore my device, seeing as how 6.1.3 is now out.

**Here's the Fix**
Thanks to /u/locrawl.

&gt;OMFG I FIXED IT -- PLEASE READ!!!!!
After submitting a few logs to saurik, I got this in response:
&gt;&gt;The one thing that ThemeReady seemed to be screwing with was the clock font, and that's the thing that actually crashed here, so that's probably related. Maybe the font database was left in an inconsistent state, or maybe the font itself was copied incorrectly and ended up being deleted or otherwise corrupted. If others have this issue they may try replacing /System/Library/Fonts/Cache/LockClock.ttf (although maybe it is then hard to rebuild the metadata files).

I didn't find the font in the cache, so I assumed all was lost. I was 2 seconds away from doing a full 6.1.3 restore before I decided to look into the file system one last time for any OpenBackup backups just in case I can restore in the future. While doing so, I stumbled upon
    
    var/mobile/Library/BytaFont/Backup/LockClock.tff
Holy Shit. There it was. I copied it into
    
    /System/Library/Fonts/Cache/
as per saurik's suggestion, and BAM!! INSTAFIX!! Immediately my iphone sprang back to life.
TL;DR - Copy LockClock.tff from var/mobile/Library/BytaFont/Backup/ into /System/Library/Fonts/Cache/. Just in case you don't have the font, I threw up on Mega for you guys. Link below. Goodluck!

**POSSIBLE WORKAROUND**

Thanks to /u/smattk who found this. Apparently calling your phone while it is in the bootloop will get it out and into safe mode.

EDIT: Still not sure that's a complete fix. My Springboard looks like it's totally trashed. Locking the screen causes it to bootloop, even after removing MobileSubstrate and all tweaks.

1364592071.0,60,self.iOSthemes,1b9l1n,Hey themers/designers! How about a nice theme to showcase my little tweak -- CustomBattery?,66,6,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/1b9l1n/hey_themersdesigners_how_about_a_nice_theme_to/,"Screenshot:
&gt; [Custom Battery](http://i.imgur.com/O8i5v9B.png)

About:
&gt; Allows for custom 1% battery images, much like Android. I am not a graphic designer, so what you see in the screenshot is the best I can do -- but this tweak is completely themeable! If someone would like to create a theme with a little more spark, I'd love to include it when I finally release this publically on Cydia (for free, of course).

How:
&gt; Simply create an image for each battery percentage (100-0), for a total of 101 images, with the following naming scheme: `WhiteOnBlackEtch_BatteryLevel_[xx]@2x.png` (eg. `WhiteOnBlackEtch_BatteryLevel_100@2x.png`, `WhiteOnBlackEtch_BatteryLevel_1@2x.png`). Then, using Winterboard, place them in a custom theme with the bundle `com.apple.UIKit` (eg. `/Library/Themes/Your CustomBattery Theme.theme/Bundles/com.apple.UIKit`)

Install
&gt; Add the following repo: `http://repo.fortysixandtwo.com/` and install the package `CustomBattery`. That's it! There are no settings to configure.

Notes
&gt; Please keep in mind that this tweak is BETA. So, please, report anything funky that you come across. I can't imagine there really being much of anything, but just in case! Also, this tweak will *automatically* hide the default iOS battery and battery percentage from your status bar. I plan to add a toggle for this later. 

Thanks

I'm thinking instead of having it be a free for all, reply to my post sort of poll, we'll have separate categories for better organization:

* Icon/Complete themes (ie Glasklart, Jaku, Ayecon)
* Lockscreen themes (ie LS Nimbus, Nobelis HD, Minuet)
* UI themes (ie Depth, SlimPly, themes that theme apps)
* Fonts (duh)
* Wallpaper sources (not individual ones, both iPhone/iPad resolution and not)
* Zeppelin themes

&gt; **Edit 1**: Would you prefer Zeppelin icons to be a separate category, or should they be lumped in with the broader category UI themes? Also, should ColorKeyboard be included with UI themes too?

&gt; **Edit 2**: ColorKeyboard will be included with UI themes, Zeppelin gets its own theme.

This will be at the least a yearly polling, biyearly if deemed necessary.

If this idea is popular, then we'll just go ahead and do it next week (don't want to push it back too far and lose contest mode).

Basically, people just submit their set ups and the community votes on the one they like the most. Winner gets some sort of prize. Depending on what kind of prize it is, we could hold this maybe once every two or three months.

Now, this isn't a promise that it will happen any time soon or at all for that matter (since I just thought of it 5 minutes ago), this is more to see if it's something the community is interested in.

**Edit:** I'm thinking about a prize, and I'm very heavily against bugging tweak/theme/app devs for free copies to giveaway to members of the subreddit. I'd really not want to push their generosity too far, especially if this is going to become a relatively regular event. I'm thinking maybe flair signifying how many of these competitions you've won would work much better, although obviously that isn't very much of a material reward.

Also, a few concerns that occurred to me after reading /u/PiwwowPants' comment are:

* How would people feel about others who enter in old submissions? Would it become a ""Hey, my submission should be better because it's new, Billy Bob Joe posted this submission a week ago/in last month's competition."" We can easily bar people from submitting things that have been entered in previous competitions, but what about those who made posts prior to a competition?
* Would this sort of thing lower the number of people submitting awesome and original content to /r/iOSthemes (the last thing we want) in the hopes of saving something very cool for the competition? (I'd imagine if the prize were just flair, this might not be as big of an issue)
* Would this have lasting popularity (eg enough to last for over a year)? When I held Tweak Madness, the interest in it at the end of the competition was about 1/3 the interest in it when the competition started.

**Edit 2:** Nobody has addressed my biggest concern:

**Would you be ok with receiving flair as a prize? Or do you want something more material? It's ok to be greedy and say you'd rather receive a free theme/tweak/app. The community's choice will decide whether this becomes a monthly/once every two months competition (where winners receive flair) or a biyearly competition (where winners receive a theme/tweak/app).**

**Edit 3:** I also had some more thoughts. In order to make things as fair as possible, submissions would be 100% anonymous (in other words, only mods would get to see usernames to prevent multiple submissions). You'd then vote on the ones you like the most (say top 5). Then the top 5-10 will be revealed (along with who submitted them) and go into a ""final"" round and be voted on by the community.

[Just for fun: Sloth Flow LS](http://i.imgur.com/SPKsgRg.png)  


##About  
I've spent the past week or so working on this theme, making the layouts, icons, widgets, etc. I posted a preview [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/1anae7/work_in_progress_my_windows_phone_theme/) and it was greeted with kind words. After about a weeks worth of work, I've grown fairly satisfied with it. Of course, there is *much* room for improvement. There are only about 20 icons, even on my own phone not everything is themed, as you can see in the screenshots above. I've been slowly working on getting the actual UI themed, but anyways, what's there is there. I don't think I'll be working on it much more after this release, but I hope the community will get behind this and turn it into something great!  

Now, here we go:  
_______________________________

##Warning  
This theme is **not** plug-and-play, and will require a decent amount of time and effort to set up.  
Retina devices only! iPhone 5 is untested and likely unsupported.  
I had to go through a full restore while making this theme, and wouldn't want that to happen to anybody else. 
If you aren't sure about a step, please ask and I will try to clarify! I am not responsible for your device :)  
  
##Requirements:  

- Iconoclasm  
- PerPageHTML  
- Springtomize 2  
- An SSH Client [[WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/download.php) | [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) | [RBrowser](http://www.rbrowser.com/)]  


If you want to customize things to fit your liking:  

- [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/downloads/)  
- [Iconoclasm Layout Builder](http://modmyi.com/forums/os-apps-development/702480-iconoclasm-layout-builder.html)  

  
##Installation  
______________

In order to get the *exact* same layout and theme that I currently have, do the following:  
**Note:** Do not enable any themes in Winterboard until step 17.  

1. Download the theme from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6hebfezafcwcqwn/wPhone.zip)  
Extract it to a folder, inside you will find:  
    1\. *LargePages*: PerPageHTML backgrounds for the large tiles  
    2\. *Iconoclasm Layouts*: A large variety of icon layouts for large tiles and banners  
    3\. *WP8 Blank Icons.theme*: Invisible icons for overlaying large tiles  
    4\. *WP8 Icons.theme*: Themed icons  
    5\. *WP8 UI.theme*: Theming for UI elements [todo]  
    6\. *WP8 Widget.theme*: Bottom clock widget (optional)  
    7\. *WP8 ClearLock.theme*: A lockscreen with all clear elements, to be combined with your wallpaper  
    8\. *Sloth Flow.theme*: A sweet lock-screen theme that has nothing to do with wPhone  
3. SSH into your phone using whatever client you prefer, I figure /r/iOSThemes doesn't need a guide for that :)  
4. Place the "".theme"" folders into /var/stash/Themes/
5. Place the Iconoclasm .plist files in /Library/Iconoclasm/Layouts
6. Place the folders in *LargePages* in /var/mobile/Library/PerPageHTML
6. Go to Settings-&gt;Iconoclasm-&gt;Per Page Layouts-&gt;Enable
7. Set Page 1 to ""WP8 2 Left 1 MRight""  
8. Set Page 2 to ""WP8 1 BLeft 2 Right""  
9. Set Page 3 to ""WP8 MLBanner 1 BLeft""  
10. Set Page 4 to ""WP8 MRBanner 1 TRight""  
11. Set Page 5 to ""WP8 Left 1 MRight""  
11. Set Page 6 to ""WP8 MLBanner""
12. Set the rest of the pages to ""WP8 All Small Tiles."" Here's an [image reference](http://i.imgur.com/oE1BBLU.png). It says ""WP8 No Large Tiles"" in the image, but that's just a different name for the same layout.  
13. In Springtomize, go to Icons-&gt;Resize-&gt;120%  
14. Open PerPageHTML, set ""Home"" to Page 1, ""Social"" to Page 2, ""Internet"" to Page 3, ""Media"" to Page 4, ""Settings"" to page 5, and ""Games"" to page 6.  
15. Respring.  
16. Arrange the icons on your Springboard properly. After this step your springboard should look something [like this](http://imgur.com/a/7yoMz).  
17. Enable the WP8 Icons Theme.  
18. Enable the WP8 Blank Tiles theme, placing it above the WP8 Icons Theme.
19. Finally, enable the WP8 Bottom Widget theme (if you want) and place it above the other two.  
    Note that if you choose to enable the widget, this will effectively make your dock useless.  
18. Respring, and enjoy wPhone!  

##Complementary Elements
- Open Sans Light is a very slick font that goes very well with this theme.  
- ColorKeyboard with WP7 Gray + Mango looks awesome as well.  
- Blackout is a good tweak if you are using ""WP8 Clear Lock"", as well as Clock Hide.  

##Customization  
______

This section is for those who want to have unique layouts, large tiles, and icons. You should have some basic experience with GIMP and be a fairly proficient theme-user. You can download an accumulation of the tile packs I used [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t24kzoqn22erfc1/wPhone_IconPacks.zip). 

#*Weather*  
Simplest things first! To customize the weather tile on the home page, go to LargeTilePages/Home/yahooweather.js and change the ""locale"" value to your zip code.  

#*Large Tile pages*  
1. Open ""LargePages/Page.xcf""  
2. You will see the ""Home"" page template. The guides are for aligning the tiles properly, as well as the text at the bottom of them.  
3. Each tile has its own layer group, which you can expand to reveal the icon and the text layers  
4. There are also several large banner layers, which you can customize even more to your liking.  
5. Use the icons from the packs found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t24kzoqn22erfc1/wPhone_IconPacks.zip) to make your own.  
6. You will need blank icons for the real icon that will be in its place. For this you can copy the icon in ""WP8 Blank Tiles.theme/AppleBlank.png"" to the proper folder  
   for Stock/Cydia icons and the icon in ""WP8 Blank Tiles.theme/AppStoreBlank.png"" for AppStore icons. Obviously, you will have to rename these accordingly (app specific).  

#*Custom Iconoclasm layouts*  
You will need to do this if you are planning on using a different large tile background than those provided.  
1. Open Iconoclasm Layout Builder.  
2. Open the ""Iconoclasm Layouts/All Small Tiles.plist"" file within the program.  
3. You will see a 4x6 grid of small tiles. Wherever you want a large tile, delete 3 icons in that area and move the 4th one in the center of the blank space.  
4. The naming scheme I used is like this: A layout with 2 large tiles on the left starting from row 2 and 1 on the right starting from row 3 would get the name ""WP8 2 UMLeft 1 MRight."" This effectively translates to ""**2** starting from **U**pper **M**iddle row on the **L**eft column and **1** on the **M**iddle row on the **R**ight column"" This made sense to me at the time but I realized how crazy it was as the amount of layouts grew. Feel free to give them to more sensible names.  
5. Upload these layouts using either Iconoclasm Layout Builder, or your SSH client of choice (/Library/Iconoclasm/Layouts).  
6. Enable the layout on the proper page and respring

#*Small icons*  
1. Open ""WP8 Small Tiles.theme/AppleIcon.xcf"" or ""WP8 Small Tiles.theme/StoreIcon.xcf,"" depending on which you want.  
2. Customize to your liking. The Stock / Cydia icons will take like half a second longer, since you have to account for the offsets within the layer.  
3. The basic process is finding the icon you want to use, pasting it into the GIMP project, re-sizing to 114x114, moving to proper origin, and anchoring to the existing layer.  

##Notes
__________  

- If you want to modify or redistribute this theme, all I ask is that you give credit to me and those mentioned below.  
- This has **NOT** been tested or configured for the iPhone 5. I would love if someone ported it, because I know it'd look a lot better with an extra free row!  
- If you don't want the widget, and would prefer icons on your dock, resize dock icons to 110% in Springtomize.  
- If anybody knows of a way to remove the dock **without** changing the icon layout, I'd love to hear it, so I can add an extra usable row.  
- Obviously, this theme is a fresh release and is thus likely to have bugs.  
- I finished the weather tile like, yesterday. I did not know a lick of CSS / JS prior, so bear with me. I'm sure a web-dev can improve upon it greatly!  
- Only apps that I currently have / use on my phone / can easily theme have been themed.  
- I really advise giving a shot at theming your own icons, it's really easy and addicting! The icon packs are already there for you, just find something suitable.  
- I will take some icon requests, but I'm a programmer, not a graphic artist, so unless the icon is easy to make with the packs I have, I'm afraid I won't be able to do a good job.  
- If you want to try and request an icon, please be sure to include your device type, the bundle identifier, the icon name, and the color you want the icon to be. The ID and name can usually be found using AppInfo, available in Cydia.

This method really caught my eye, because I've never seen a dev go out of his/her way to make something as polished and refined as Circul8, only to ask for donations. On top of that, he's not even having us send the money to him and let him donate it. The money goes directly to charity and all he wants is a copy of the receipt. 

Andreas Larsen, you are a great person and I hope that more devs will be able to do what you do, man!

There are 38 minimal retina ready icons (V1 pack) for iPhone 5. My original plan was to have way more icons, a custom keyboard, lockscreen, etc... basically a full user interface. I got sidetracked and prioritized other projects that I've been working on for the past few weeks and I apologize for that. Because I still have a lot of work to do on other projects, I'm only releasing the customized icons and the keyboard.  

**WANT MORE ICONS?**  
You can request for them only here and I promise they will ALL be made.  

**USE THIS FORMAT AS AN EXAMPLE**     
Name of App: App Store  
Bundle ID: com.apple.AppStore  
Icon: icon@2x.png  

**NOTE**  
Download AppInfo from Cydia or use iFunbox (or any other related programs) to find out the information above of the app you want.  

**ABOUT THE KEYBOARD:**  
Along with the custom keyboard, there is also the popups as well. As for the mic, it's the default iPhone design, and can be customized through other packages via Cydia. Future releases WILL include the mic. Also, ColorKeyboard from Cydia is required to install this theme!  

**Update As of Saturday April 6nd, 2013:** 
Droplet Icons V1 are Droplet Keyboard are officially on the MMi Repo! Get it now!

Credits and instructions are in the LockBackground.html file. You can change the colours pretty easily, but it will take some trial and error. I suggest running it on your computer and choosing your colours there before copying it to your phone. It will be on a repo soon. For now download and copy through ssh.

This has actually been asked for numerous times in this subreddit, and the answer always given is ""Backboard exists but it's not updated."" so I'm sure there's a lot of people who'd want to beta test something like this.

It's called 'Pebbly' and inspired by [the Pebble watch](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Pebble_watch_trio_group_04.png). 

It's pertty basic. Time is displayed as a string, today's weather as an icon, 5 day forecast. Rain, Snow, Sun all have specific icons for the forecast. 

There are 4 versions included: Dark, Light, Blue and Pink.

Download from [here](http://studiographic.ca/pebbly/). Unzip and copy the folders into /Library/Themes. Activate with Winterboard.

Instructions for getting your local weather:

* Go to http://www.weather.com/ and put your city into the search bar, hit enter. 
* Copy the code from the end of the url. Example for Toronto, Canada: http://www.weather.com/weather/right-now/Toronto+Canada+CAXX0504
* Copy ""CAXX0504"". 
* Open LockBackground.html from the chosen theme folder, and copy it into the 'locale' variable as directed. 

I'll be tinkering with it, so if you have any comments/suggestions let me know.

Enjoy.

**Edit (25 Feb.)**

v0.2 is out. 

* Cleaned up some code (thanks /u/balkonkind!)
* Fixed fahrenheit bug (and made it easier to change between the two. There is a variable at the top of the LockBackground.html now with instructions on how to change from celsius (default) to fahrenheit.
* Added one more version, [Pebbly BG](http://imgur.com/D3sIsV9) that has a graphic background. To change the background, in the root folder replace bg.png with your image. You can add a bg.png to any of the other versions now as well to change from a solid colour.

You can download v0.2 [here](http://www.studiographic.ca/pebbly).

""With the help of WinterBoard, it’s actually extremely easy to figure out the file names of every image in iOS. In WinterBoard’s ‘Advanced’ settings, turn ‘Record UIImages’ to ON. Every image that is not themed will be saved as PNGs into /tmp/UIImages. For example, if you want to theme Phone.app’s dialer, open the Phone app to the dialer tab and those images will then be saved into the /tmp/UIImages folder. Simply SSH (or use iFile) into that folder and those images will be saved there so that you can find the images which you want to theme and use the same names for theming""",,False,self,t5_2w997,False,,,True,t3_19auaa,http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/19auaa/awesome_winterboard_tip/,

The Peekly team has grown quite a bit since its first release, and has since been expanded to include Bryce Dougherty (me), and [Max Katzmann](/u/maxkatzmann), as well as the original creator, [Stubetcha](/u/stubetcha). A lot of work has gone into the creation of this app, and we hope you guys enjoy the new and improved Peekly!

The Peekly+ app gives you the functionality to fully customize the Peekly lockscreen within an easy-to-use app, rather than having to use complicated settings files. We tried our best to include all of the existing Peekly options, including:

* Change weather icons
* Change Clocks
* Custom wallpapers
* Change the ""Peek"" mode with ease
* Change between 1 and 2 pages
* Customize weather location
* Refresh without a respring
* And more!

Many more features are in the works as well, such as SMS, email, and Velox support, and possibly even an API for other developers to add functionality to Peekly. 

Also, If you haven't seen the preview video, I'd recommend checking it out, it's really cool. [Here's the Link.](http://vimeo.com/64430875)

Here's the ModMyi info page for Peekly+ as well: [Link](http://modmyi.com/cydia/package.php?id=62728)

While the theme itself will always be free, the actual app will cost a dollar ($0.99). Please support the devs, we spend a lot of our time making these tweaks and Apps for you guys, and we're planning new features even now!

Thanks for all the support you guys have given us, and we hope you enjoy!

I searched endlessly over /r/iOSthemes for a good long-lasting collection of iPad themes for everyone to use, but I simple cannot find one. So, here's one for ya!

This post is surely and purely dedicated to iPad themes only, SD or HD (meaning iPad 1 &amp; 2 for SD, and iPad 3 &amp; 4 for HD/Retina, if you do not know this.). I want to keep this first post filled with a large database of all different kinds of iPad themes, if people submit them of course. :P

But if you are like me, then you would have been looking all over Google or Yahoo or Bing, or this subreddit for good looking iPad themes that come up to par with the latest iPhone 4/4S/5 themes, but with no success. Well I am here to tell you to have no fear, for if the iPad is the only iOS device you got, then this post can help you with some themes to get you started with your setup.

Well, enough blabbering, let's get on with the themes! I have a few already to start us off.

*****

**Lockscreens**

[LS Live Clock For iPad](http://imgur.com/h4pzx7X) - Free, SD &amp; HD (Available on the Modmyi repo, installed by default in Cydia) - A very simple and minimal live clock with a nice scrolling animation.

[Typophone 4](http://cj-caty.deviantart.com/art/Typophone-4-for-iPad-195872777) - Free, SD &amp; HD (Must have iFile/SSH or a directory explorer to install. Someone please provide a repo for this one if you can.) - A very classy and popular lockscreen. Slide to Unlock Killer &amp; Lockscreen Clock Hide can remove the default black bars/clock.

*****

**Homescreens (Icon Packs)**

[Ayecon For iPad](http://www.surenix.me/ayecon/ipad/) - $2.99, SD &amp; HD (Available on the BigBoss repo, installed by default in Cydia) - A very artsy homescreen icon pack. Install with Iconclasm, Springtomize 2, and other tweaks to improve look.

[boss.iPad](http://modmyi.com/forums/ipad-new-skins-themes-launches/809908-boss-ipad-1-2-retina.html) - $3.99, SD &amp; HD (Available on the Cydia Theme it app found under the repo, http://www.themeitapp.com/repo) - This theme features high-quality icons and dark colors to really make it stand out. The borders on all of its icons are what make this theme just so great!

[Stark](http://www.macciti.com/showthread.php?t=4862) - $3, SD &amp; HD (Available on the BigBoss repo, installed by default in Cydia) - For those who like the classic white to gray gradient, and don't fear a little bit of minimalism, this theme should fall in love with you and you right at it!

[SE7EN SD/HD iPAD 1/2/3](http://modmyi.com/forums/ipad-new-skins-themes-launches/810588-se7en-hd-ipad-3-jimmyl.html) - $2.99, SD &amp; HD (Available on the Modmyi repo, installed by default in Cydia. NOTE: The link in the title for this theme takes you to the HD version. This is just demonstration.) - A very sleek and high-quality iPad theme that uses dark colors mixed with lighter colors like blue to make it unique. The small border around each icon looks great, and it a good reference for other themers making icons!

*****

I know there are only 2 up there at the time of this composition, but these are seriously 2 of the only themes I could find that have full iPad support without going into iFile and renaming certain images and files. I hope you can understand my frustration when it comes to iPad themes.

**Format for Submitting Themes**

&gt;[name of theme here]

&gt;[free or paid, if paid then list price]

&gt;[sd, or hd, or both]

&gt;[list name of repo, and URL for repo, if no repo, then link for download]

&gt;[optional, a description of the ls or hs theme]

Thank you for reading my post, and I hope this helps you with your iPad setup. :) Have a nice day or night, where ever you live.

Relatively Finalized images at http://imgur.com/a/cUMcb

**To start, make sure you have the following. This is not a plug and play theme, and will require some photoshop/plist/html editing to make it look how you want.**

**Things required for this theme:**

* My Windows Zip Theme (at bottom of post)

* Iconoclasm

* Minimal HD Slider (or your choice of slider)

* No Calendar Date (on Cydia)

* No Icon Shadow (included in winterboard I believe)

* Transparent Dock (included in winterboard)

* Springtomize 2 

* *Optional* : FolderEnhancer

* Common Sense/Basic Knowledge of editing themes/icons in photoshop and a text editor


This will be broken into a few categories. 


**Lockscreen**

First is the easiest, Unzip windows7.zip and put the WP7-Lockscreen into your themes Folder and turn it on. Change the Lockbackground.png if you'd like something else. Boom, done.


**Widget Clock**

Same as before, put the WidgetClock Folder in your Themes folder and turn it on. It is anchored to the bottom of your screen. Now is the best time to start deciding how you want your theme layout to look (It's not easy to change once you have it picked.) I drew my inspiration from this image. http://cdn2.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/7165171/htc-8x-review-1369_large_verge_super_wide.jpg

If you want to keep your clock at the bottom as a ""clockdock"" then you're done, leave it alone. **This folder is where your background will go. It will be named Layer.png.** If you want your clock widget to go elsewhere, edit the coordinates in Wallpaper.html



**Icons**

I've included the ones I've made, as well as a .PSD file with the layout I used. All of your icons must be 118x120 for the Iphone 5. A good start for people that don't want to do much work is download minimal HD and find the icons you want and edit them to have sharp corners and the color. I personally edited the icons at 
http://dakirby309.deviantart.com/art/Metro-UI-Dock-Icon-Set-678-Icons-280724102

Place these icons in the appropriate folders and you're 75% there. Now it's time to decide where you want the ""big"" icons to go. The problem is, iOS doesn't do different sized icons, or at least not to my knowledge. So you have to be creative with how you choose to do it. I used a photoshop background with specific icons painted on. In my case, the ""pictures"" ""music"" and ""clock"" box are painted onto the background(which once again, goes inside of the widgetclock theme folder). Here's a screenshot of my homescreen background with no icons on. 

http://i.imgur.com/ayBj1DY.png

The bigger ""icons"" are just a part of the background, with a transparent icon placed in the center of them. That's what iconoclasm is for and you will have to edit your layout based on how you choose to make yours. . I have included the .plist I have used as well in case you'd like to try making mine first.

**In springtomize set your icons to 120% for the spacing I'm using.**

I hope I didn't lose anyone, I'll answer questions as they come up.

&gt; With the move to the wiki, the list is now editable by anyone who wishes to. A few things to note:

&gt; * You must have earned at least 100 cumulative karma to make an edit. If you don't have 100 karma and would like to make an edit, please let the mods know and we'll make you an approved editor.
&gt; * Please do your best to maintain chronological order of the list wherever possible. (Usually putting it at the end of the list is good enough)
&gt; * You're free to make and edit whatever pages you like. Fill it with links to cool things and tutorials!
&gt; * I hate to have to say this, but the mods can see every page that is created and every change that is made. We'd hate to have to ban people from editing the wiki.

**Other things**

&gt; * Special flair is coming soon! I'll do it sometime this week, whenever I've got a 2-3 hour block of free time.

&gt; * Don't forget about the August theme contest! [Details here](http://redd.it/1jeshr)

&gt; * You'll also notice that this post is stickied, it's a feature that was added to Reddit today.

This is why I assume this guide is still relevant. It's literally a copy/paste from my old guide on /r/jailbreak from about 6 months ago. I'll still try to answer any questions you have to the best of my ability.

Just let me preface this with I do not make my own custom themes, nor is this going to be a total all-out ""theme every single thing on your phone"" guide. It's just for the icons, by using Winterboard(available for free on Cydia). It will also assume you know how to SSH into your phone and/or have iFile and know how that works. Any problems or questions feel free to message me and/or comment and I'll do my best to help you through it. 


Okay, now that that's out of the way, let's start. First, you'll need the icons you want. You likely found them on DeviantArt, or maybe you have a theme already and some icons were added afterwards that you wanted. Basically, step one is find the icons you want to use in your theme, and know what you want them for. Got them? Okay good. 


Now, on your computer (Somewhere, I generally start in My Documents although it's pretty irrelevant) make a folder called [whateveryouwantyouthemetobecalled].theme. I'll just call it mytheme.theme for future reference, although if you felt like it you could call it titcockfuckballs.theme. It really doesn't matter, the name of the theme is what will show up in Winterboard. Inside this folder, make a folder called Bundles. Yes it must be called Bundles, with a capital B and everything. Now, inside Bundles, you will be making folders specifically for each icon you want to theme. You can find the bundle identifiers for [a vast majority of] apps [here] (http://ios.xengi.org/cfbundleidentifier/ios/), or by using a [FREE] app on Cydia called AppInfo. For this example I'll be theming Apple's native Calculator app. So, we go to the previously linked site/AppInfo, ctrl+f ""Calculator"", and note that the bundle identifier is com.apple.calculator and the icon name is ""icon@2x.png"", so we make a folder in Bundles called com.apple.calculator and inside this folder we place the icon we want for it, named icon@2x.png. Do the same exact thing for every other icon you want themed: look up the bundle identifier and icon name, make a folder in Bundles with the same name as the identifier and name the icon whatever the icon should be(generally icon or Icon, the @2x signifies retina devices unless I'm horribly mistaken. If you don't include the @2x when you should have, the icon will look incredibly oversized and can be fixed by adding the @2x in the filename. iPad apps I believe are generally -72, although I don't have an iPad so I have no real experience with it).


So, now we should have mytheme.theme, with a folder called Bundles inside of it, with a folder called com.apple.calculator inside of that, and our calculator icon called icon@2x.png. From this point, SSH into your phone and navigate to /private/var/stash/Themes.XXXX (the XXXX being a jumble of letters/numbers). Copy your theme in here. Go into Winterboard on your phone, and your theme name should be selectable. Select it, respring, and your calculator(or other various icons) should be themed!


The lazy as fuck way to do this(I've found) is instead of making a Bundles folder, name it Icons and just fill it with the icons named after whatever app you're theming. Example being that you would have mytheme.theme with a folder called Icons, containing Calculator.png. This is the old Summerboard way of theming, so if you decide to do this make sure Summerboard mode is checked in Winterboard. I find this is much less reliable than using the bundle identifiers, however.


The total badass way is to dick around in your filesystem to find the actual app folder and replace the icon for it with the one you want, although I think app updates cause you to have to re-do this every time after they update. Aside from that I'm pretty sure there's no way for this to not work. You'd also be losing out on the default icons if you ever wanted to switch back to them, although making backups beforehand helps if you don't care.


Also note that pretty much everything is case sensitive, if something says it should be Icon.png and not icon.png, you can't skip out on using your shift key for one letter. It wont work otherwise.


I hope this helped some of you, and that those of you who know this(or English/guide-writing) better will correct me on grammar and spelling and logistics since this is the way I've learned and been doing it. Happy theming!


For transparent icons: If you use them (which many people do, they're fucking awesome), you might have a problem where some apps will have a hideous black border/background/shading/whatever it is the kids these days call it. Here is how to fix that, courtesy of [the Glasklart main post] (http://macthemes.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=16805129&amp;p=1)):

* Connect to your device using SSH or use the iFile app on your iOS device (free download from Cydia).

* Navigate to /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MobileIcons.framework/

* (for iPhone) Rename ""AppIconMask@2x.png"" to something else, such as ""AppIconMask@2x-backup.png"".

* (for iPad) Rename ""AppIconMask-72.png"" to something else, such as ""AppIconMask-72-backup.png"".

* Open WinterBoard and reselect the Icons package and Respring. If you don't see any changes yet, try to reboot your device. Now your icons should show up correctly. A side effect of this change is that unthemed icons will become square since they can't find the mask image.

1363490938.0,30,self.iOSthemes,1ag2xe,Theme Round Up (First Quarter 2013) iOS 6 Compatible,37,7,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/1ag2xe/theme_round_up_first_quarter_2013_ios_6_compatible/,"There is a general request for theme suggestions several times a week.  I’ve polled my closest redditors and came up with some themes I’d like to suggest.  We’ve all seen Ayecon.  It’s beautiful.  It’s amazing.  Pod2g lost a kidney for an early copy.  However, there are many other stunning themes out there.  Everyone has seen Jaku and Glasklart, too.  Here are some other great suggestions:

**[Carla for iOS](http://www.macciti.com/pages/custom/carlaforios/screenshots.php)** $1.99

Carla is my personal favorite theme.  It is truly all in one.  It has options for SD/HD on both phone and iPad.  (Four separate packages).  Carla is all in one because of all the different things it themes.  The only downside I have seen is that the file names for Apple Maps are not correct.  The have to be fixed in ifile for the app to theme. It comes included with:

1. Icons Theme
2. Status Bar Theme
3. Bytafont typeface
4. Zeppelin Icon
5. Colorkeyboard Theme (for both main and pop up keyboards)
6. Bitesms theme 
7. LS Theme
8. Wallpapers
9. SBS Theme

**[Prestige HD](http://www.macciti.com/pages/prestigehd/screenshots.php)** $3.50

Prestige is an iOS 6.x comptabile HD theme designed for iphone 4/4s.  Its most stunning feature are the bright yellow/orange, blue, and green colors the icons use.  It also features an auto icon mask the resizes icons.

1. Icons Theme
2. Status Bar Theme
3. Bytafont typeface (two options)
4. Colorkeyboard Theme (main and popup keyboard)
5. Bitesms Theme (two options)
6. LS Sliders
7. Wallpapers
8. SBS Theme

**[Sarif](http://modmyi.com/info/sarif.php)** $2.00

*[More Screenshots](http://codylg.com/work/iphone/sarif/)*

Sarif’s icons almost look drawn.  They are awesome to look at.  By default, sarif removes the icon names on the springboard.  It also offers two options for icon badge colors.  It comes with anti-tint as a dependency and therefore you won’t have the annoying ios 6 double-sized status bar colors when on the phone or messaging app.  The icon size is small, and the theme has a wonderful auto icon mask.  

1. Icons Theme
2. Status Bar Theme (really awesome theme that makes things small)
3. Bytafont typeface (Goulong)
4. Zeppelin Icon
5. Bitesms theme (two options)
6. LS Theme (really interesting clock)
7. Wallpapers
8. SBS Theme


**[FLite](http://www.macciti.com/pages/flite/screenshots.php)** $1.00

Designed for HD iphone devices, F.Lite is one of the smaller (in size) themes.  Its icons are truly unique.  They look like drawn caricatures.  It has the same map apps issue as Carla and must be edited in ifile.  The icons are smaller in size and the auto mask works very well.  The icons have an almost sepia like coloration to them.

Icons Theme only.  

edit: I am being told Flite is not ios 6 compatible for new purchases, but have been told it compatible with the ios if purchased before.  =(


**[Newport](http://modmyi.com/forums/iphone-5-new-skins-themes-launches/808594-newport-ios-5-released.html)** $1.99

Newport is designed for HD devices.  It is a new theme from Trent Morris.  This is his fourth major theme.  (Bloom HD, Colorgasm, and Avid).  It is visually beautiful.  It currently includes about 150 icons.  The bubble colors for texting are my absolute favorite.  The colors are soft and pastel.  

Icons Theme only.


**[Mint HD](http://www.macciti.com/pages/minthd/screenshots.php)** $2.00

*[More Screenshots](http://www.macciti.com/showthread.php?t=3864)*

As suggested by the name, Mint is designed for HD devices.  Its icons are all circles in shape.  The stock icons are all themed in white (this is one of its options).  This is very cool, but the app store icons are not colored or really themed for the most part.  They are auto masked rounded. The second option continues the idea of theming only the standard icons.  The icons are black on background with a blue glue. This is not really a complete theme.  The icon label names are small and difficult to read, so you will need a dark wallpaper for this to look best.  It comes included with a LS that is simple, lovely, though all together plain.  

Icons Theme only.

**[Absolution HD](http://www.macciti.com/pages/absolution/screenshots.php)** $1.99

This theme has been around for a long time, and it shows.  It has so many different options and addons that you will never get bored.  It has a Red, Pink, and Blue color mods for the main theme.  It includes UI sounds as well.  It has been themed for HD/SD for both iphone and iPad.  It includes support all the way back to iOS 4.  It is one of the most complete themes I have ever seen.  Icons are darker in color.  They are a square with a rounded corner and the auto app mask is very effective.  The icons are dark, as stated, but they have little bursts of light in each icon.  You'll have to see it to know what I mean. 

1. Icons Theme
2. Status Bar Theme
3. Colorkeyboard Theme (for both main and pop up keyboards)
4. LS Theme

7. SBS Theme

Will make i4 versions later.",27,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/1h9wak/release_kind_of_ios_7_folders_for_ios_6_sadly/,"So, here's what you're going to need for this

* FolderEnhancer
* Iconoclasm
* iFile (Or any kind of SSH client)
* [These](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/95913377/iOS%207%20Folders.zip) files (Should have everything in it, hopefully)
* Photoshop (Somewhat optional, I guess)
* WinterBoard
* An iPhone 5 or iPod Tocuh 5

Sadly, for now, you can only these folders will all have the same title when the folder is open unless you choose to: 

A. Have folder with no name (In the files provided)

or

B. Use iOS 6's default folder naming

So... 

Let's get started!

Part 1.

1. Download the files provided.
2. Use Photoshop to change the name of your folder or just delete the name of the folder. The font is Helvetica Neue-UltraLight.
3. Save that file as ""FEFolderBG-568h@2x.png""
4. Make a folder, using iFile or an SSH client, in /var/stash/Themes.xxxxxx called ""iOS 7 Folders.theme""
5. In that folder, make a folder named ""Bundles"" and inside that, make a folder named ""com.apple.springboard'
5. Using an SSH client (If you used Photoshop) or iFile (If you just downloaded the no name folder .png) move ""FEFolderBG-568h@2x.png"" to /var/stash/Themes.xxxxxx/iOS 7 Folders.theme/Bundles/com.apple.springboard (AKA the folder you just made)
6. Now move ""iOS 7 Folder Layout.plist"" (One of the files I provided) to /Library/Iconoclasm/Layouts

Part 2. (All on the device now)

1. In the settings app, go to FolderEnhancer-&gt;Appearance (Make sure Folder Name is set to ON)-&gt;Text Color. Now set the Alpha down to 0% (Unless you decide to use iOS's default naming, then this can be left at 100%) 
2. Now go to FolderEnhancer-&gt;Appearance and make sure Use Image File is set to ON and Enable Border is set to OFF
3. Go to Iconoclasm's settings in the settings app. For the ""Extras"" layouts, select iOS 7 Folder Layout
4. Apply changes and respring!

Final Products:

* Folder with no name: http://i.imgur.com/yKXs77u.png
* Folder with custom name: http://i.imgur.com/TeLwBp3.png
* Folder with no name using iOS's default naming: http://i.imgur.com/HsElCDz.png

Sorry for the lengthy instructions! Hope they were clear enough! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Decided to put together a clone of the Android Jellybean digital clock widget for my setup, figured I'd share. **Requires Dashboard X.**

For optimal viewing, make sure to set `Replace Background` to **OFF**

This uses the original resources (eg. TTF) from the Android_4.2 AOSP source. The size(s) and fonts are authentic.

To install, add the following repo: `http://repo.fortysixandtwo.com/` and install the package **JellybeanClock** (note: this is entirely different than JellyClock -- I just suck at coming up with names for things).

Enjoy! :)

___

As of version 1.1, you can now configure the look a bit by manually editing the configuration file: `/Library/DashboardX/Widgets/JellybeanClock.bundle/JellybeanClock.plist`

There you can specify alternate fonts as well as time and date formats ([more info](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-25.html#Date_Format_Patterns)). **Be careful. :)** 

For reference, the current (default) configuration is:

    &lt;dict&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;TimeFontDefault&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;AndroidClockMono-Light&lt;/string&gt;

        &lt;string&gt;AndroidClockMono-Thin&lt;/string&gt;

        &lt;string&gt;Roboto-BoldCondensed&lt;/string&gt;

Not included but available as a separate theme is Flush Notifications, which leaves the first alert unthemed but moves secondary notifications to the top of the screen. To use it with Frost LS, just enable both in Winterboard, with Flush Notifications on top of the list. If you want those to be clear as they are in the screenshot you also need to install NoLockNotificationsBG in Cydia:

Happy to answer questions if needed. There is a really good ReadMe file included with the theme that will answer a LOT of basic questions on how to change weather, how to move things around, etc. If you have a question, it very well could be answered there!

Open Notepad in Windows and paste this into it.

    &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;LockBackground.html&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style type=""text/css""&gt;
    body {

	background-size: 320px 480px;
	background-repeat:no-repeat;
	margin:0;
	padding:0;
    }
    &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

Save the file as ""LockBackground.html"" without the quotes. Create a folder with whatever name you want and add "".theme"" behind it. For example my folder is called ""GifWallpaper.theme"".

Place the LockBackground.html file and your gif into the folder. Rename the gif as ""Wallpaper.gif"".

Copy the folder into /private/var/stash/Themes. Go to Winterboard and apply the theme and you're done!

This is my very first subreddit and I thought it would be a cool idea to make a place for artists to take advantage of the Dynamic feature of iOS7, and of course stills but with bigger dimensions to keep high resolutions in our screens (since iOS7 zooms in the still image to apply the 3D effect.)

Hi! I've just made a reddit account (after lurking for some time!) and I wanted to share an update to the Geometry mod. It's minor but if you've updated to the latest version of JellyLock, you'll find it's so much easier to change your lock button, and you can do it without iFile/SSH (after installing of course).

Thanks to [hizinfiz](http://www.reddit.com/user/hizinfiz/) for posting them in the past and to [pk1st](http://pk1st.deviantart.com) for the original icons.

Hopefully if this is popular, I might be able to find other devs that would be interested in doing things like this in the future.

---

Blur is a relatively new app that adds a gaussian blur effect to photos, thus making them into really great wallpapers. They go well with a variety of themes, here are some examples:

* [iOS 7 theme](http://imgur.com/a/jVRC3)
* [Parantheme](http://imgur.com/a/m5UK5)
* [Sarif](http://imgur.com/a/XuiLU)
* [Jaku](http://imgur.com/a/7Cxph)
* [Colorific](http://imgur.com/a/Huc2t)
* [Stock iOS 6](http://imgur.com/a/te4ei)
* [Before and after of the wallpapers used](http://imgur.com/a/zEaoB/)

Obviously, this is something that you could easily do in 30 seconds on Photoshop using the Gaussian Blur filter. So why use this app?

* It gives you a good idea of what the final product will look like on your device
* You can change the blur level much faster than in Photoshop
* You can blur multiple photos much faster than in Photoshop
* It's much cheaper (if you don't already have Photoshop)

Info:

* It's $0.99
* [US iTunes link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blur./id637855838?ls=1&amp;mt=8)
* [Dev Website](http://www.enormo.us/)
* [Dev Twitter](https://twitter.com/Enormousness)

As mentioned in the title, I have been given 3 codes by the devs to giveaway. Simply leaving a comment below guarantees you an entry. Downvoting others will not increase your chances of winning.

If you don't win, I highly recommend picking this up, it really is a great app (and the devs are ex-jailbreakers too!).

**Edit**: Actually it just occurred to me that I may need to set some basic rules for this giveaway to prevent cheating (via multiple accounts and what not). Your account must have been made at least 12 hours before this giveaway was posted, and you must be relatively active here or in /r/jailbreak.

**Edit 2**: Shit I forgot to say when the giveaway ends. When this post is 12 hours old (at approximately 1 am PST).

Just wait for the developers to release a patch to compensate for this. One for Peekly has already been put out.**


In response to the storm of questions, I would like to address an issue regarding weather services within themes, which many people have been noticing. 

The weather services for a lot of Lockscreens have not been working for the past few days. Personally, I have been receiving an enormous amount of emails and messages about Peekly's weather not working. However, it soon became obvious that Peekly wasn't the only app that was affected. Pebbly, PerPageHTML, Flatly, and most of the other utilities weren't functioning either, so something that all these themes had in common had to be broken.

That thing turned out to be the weather API that they use: Yahoo! Weather. Most, if not all of the utilities and apps which use this particular service have gone down, and in the past 2 days, a lot posts have been made about the issue.

As far as I have been able to tell, Yahoo's weather services have not gone offline. When I attempt to send in a request manually, it returns the correct information. However, I still wasn't able to get any of the themes to work. The only difference I can find in the response is that only 2 days are returned, instead of the whole week like it was before.

My goal here is to let everyone know what is going on, so that they don't have to create panicky posts about why nothing is working. 

Hopefully it's just a small malfunction, and all will be back to normal soon. 

If anyone is able to find any more information on this, please feel free to post it here!

* A whole slew of App Store icons have been added.
* Still working on fixing the black gloss navbar.

I also want to thank smelvin0 for creating an icon set that will be included in the next update.

Basically what happened is that he got really busy with his life/job, and Minimal MIUI is no longer a priority for him. My idea was to help him and bundle as many icons as possible for the theme. How shall we accomplish this feat? Easy, bundle the icons from /u/bobinush's extensive album of custom icons for the theme, located [here](http://imgur.com/a/OLzQv#0).  And just think how much easier it would be if instead of just /u/magn2o, or just me, several of us bundled a few of the icons and sent them to him. It would only take minutes, and it would improve a semi-popular theme that many people use. In case you don't know it, the theme is located at the useful idiot repo (usefulidiot.org/repo/).

None of this is original content, I just put everything together. Credits to the appropriate people:

* Bryan Blake/bjbinc for the [wallpaper](http://fav.me/d56v1rz) used in this release and the second release, maintaining Jakurepo, and also his [Dark Grain Loading Screens](http://fav.me/d52n8tv) (I stole the layer styles from his PSD template).
* /u/nienque for her [post](http://modmyi.com/forums/iphone-4-4s-new-skins-themes-launches/795842-jaku-ios-5-a-1106.html#post6802655) to the ModMyi Jaku thread that gave me the inspiration for this project.
* All of the awesome themers who share their icons on Jakurepo for public use.

---

This initial release themes only the stock apps, but that's not to say it's lacking! There is a total of 112 loading screens, with most apps having around 3-4 variations (a few have less and some more, but that's due to availability on Jakurepo).

That being said, the download for each folder is **very** large (~50 mb). If you do end up using this, it is highly recommended that you go through and delete the screens you do not wish to use, and rename the one that you wish to use as Default@2x.png. Some apps have multiple loading screens (Music, Mail, and Phone for example) so you will need to rename all the images if you'd like to change the icon I've chosen.

I will also be taking requests for apps. I'll be filling most requests from these threads ([one](http://redd.it/1adv7v), [two](http://redd.it/1ae52c), and [three](http://redd.it/1b1osa)), but if there's anything not here you'd like to see, that's fine as well. Please keep in mind that the app should have an icon that's available on Jakurepo and is not from the default theme. If you have an icon that you'd like me to use then please include that as well.

---

I should be able to have the follow up release within two-three weeks. It'll include:

* iP4/4s versions for requested apps
* iP5 versions for requested apps
* iP4/4s and iP5 PSD for Jaku
* iP4/4s and iP5 PSD for Ayecon
* iP4/4s and iP5 PSD for MIUI
* iP4/4s and iP5 PSD for FlatIcons
* iP4/4s and iP5 PSD for any other requested theme
* iP4/4s and iP5 PSD for the stock icon mask
* Directions on how to use the PSD and convert it for use with a different theme

The loading screen packs will use Jaku icons, I will not be making loading screens for different themes. (It's too damn time consuming)

I am under the assumption that all three tweaks use the same files to theme the battery, but I am using Vox, as it is the only one that works with Statustweak. The current battery is only blue (as I wanted my personal battery to only be blue) and lacks percentage numbers (as I don't find them to be needed). I am completely willing to tailor the battery to your desire though, granted it remains vertical. The battery also only noticeably depletes every 3% as it is 34 pixels tall. Making it any taller would make it look too big. I was already pushing it on the size.


The download link is here:

* Here is the one with the fixed contrast so it is easier to see on a black status bar. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47977038/Better%20Contrast%20Blue%20Vertical%20Battery.zip


* Here is one that is green, turns yellow at 50, and turns red at 20. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47977038/Red%2C%20Yellow%2C%20Green%20Vertical%20Battery%20No%20Border.zip

I got the design idea from my friend's battery on her Android, which is probably stock. I know at least one person wanted a vertical battery and I know someone else is working on one as well that will probably be better. I just made this one quickly for myself and figured someone else may enjoy it. It is for retina devices only currently.


EDIT: I noticed that the battery is very low contrast and I will be correcting that when I get a chance. I have already found a color scheme that looks fine on a black status bar.

**Lockscreen:** [Modified Typophone 4 with black text](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4hyjenyga1ise11/Typophone%204%20black%20%28No%20UNLOCK%29.theme.zip)

* Not sure if these are necessary, but I have ClearLockscreen, Remove Slider Bkgrd, and Remove Slide to Unlock activated in Winterboard as well.

**Theme:** [Circul8 by Andreas Larsen](http://andreaslarsen.dk/c8) (since half of my apps didn't have icons created yet, i decided to contribute to the theme and made a bunch of icons that were added to the official package)

* I really wasn't feeling the orange status bar, so I had to dig through the package and find the image and change it to black.

**Layout tweaks:** 

* Iconoclasm using Iconoclasm Layout Maker to get the staggered app layout (you can search layouts in the layout maker, mines titled ""stlepin_staggered_circul8"")

* Gridlock to create the layout designs (allows you to place apps anywhere on the homescreen grid)

* Five Icon Dock

* Merge Regular Font installed with BytaFont

**Appswitcher:** Auxo (worth the purchase in my opinion)


**Other tweaks:**

* Xpandr

* SwipeSelection

* AppLocker

* Dashboard X

* MultiIcon Mover",,False,self,t5_2w997,False,,,True,t3_1a4w89,http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/1a4w89/after_hours_of_ocd_driven_personal_tweaks_ive_got/,

This is a setup that I'm currently working on, I'd like to get some feedback and suggestions from the community on things that should be changed/improved.

A lot of what you see in the screenshot is not from themes but rather the [wallpaper](http://i.imgur.com/S2XTqjn.png) I'm using.

For those curious, here's a list of what I used:

* Base theme is **Jaku** with extra icons from **Jakurepo** (I need to make myself a CARROT icon)
* [**PSD Template**](http://db.tt/YaGzME5O) (very amateur) for the wallpaper, currently 4/4s only. This was designed with Jaku in mind, so your mileage with other themes may vary.
* [**Iconoclasm layout**](http://db.tt/1AarKF66), currenly 4/4s only (this goes in /Library/Iconoclasm/Layouts/)
* Signal icons are [**SlimPly Status Bar**](http://fav.me/d5brkyb) by DjeTouch
* Zeppelin icon is [**Hipster Yolo Swag**](http://fav.me/d5xyur1) by Matruka, reuploaded by myself
* Status bar image is the bottom portion of [**Minuet 2.0**](http://fav.me/d5utsqo)'s BarLCD by /u/neinque
* Badges are [**Jaku Black Badges**](http://db.tt/HbUOWrA9) by Alfroggy
* Icon shadows are a Z|UI mod by chevymusclecar, can't find a download link at the moment
* **Winterboard** can hide the wallpaper gradient
* **Springtomize 2**
 * hides the dock icon reflection, although it's possible with a theme as well
 * shrinks the icons, it's currently set at 90%
* Font is Nexa by Fontme
* I'm planning on making the landscape portion of the wall rotate, /u/Natsuai's [**tutorial**](http://redd.it/1hgj16) is what helped me discover the theme

So If u want to put a widget on ur home screen using dashboardX,
 You must have Folder Enhancer(available in cydia) for this to work. Now:
1. Open any folder, then tap &amp; hold the empty space inside the folder.
2. Now the icons would start jiggling, tap&amp;hold again in the blank space then you should see the DashboardX widget screen pop up! 
    
   Just choose the desired widget and you're good to go! It may work without FolderEmhancer too,i just havent checked that out yet.

Therefore I am going to try to undertake the task of creating one specifically with these icons in mind. If anyone would like to help split the work it would be much appreciated as I would really like to see the GUI be released in several color schemes so people have options. 

I would also need beta testers which I know there should be no shortage of here given the popularity of the icon set.

EDIT: I have made a color scheme for the initial release. Those who would like to work on it pm me for a download link and your experience and how much time you could put into the project

EDIT 2: /u/bobinush and I will be working on this project together so I'm hoping the initial release gets cranked out if not this week then next week. Once several native apps are skinned we will be releasing the first color set which will be a single theme based on the color choices in the WP7CK Gray1 ColorKeyboard package. Everyone that wants to find out can go check it out. Once all native apps are skinned accordingly, we will begin working on other color formats and separating them by section(navbar color, button color, accent color, etc) to give it a customized feel for each user so that everyone can have it exactly how they like it.",,False,self,t5_2w997,1365198618.0,,,True,t3_1ayhwe,http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/1ayhwe/minimal_miui_gui_to_match_the_icon_set/,

&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  


There are always ""unlock"" concepts being made. There were the [Piano passcode](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/196gba/is_there_a_pianolike_passcode/) concept, then the [NES concept](http://www.reddit.com/tb/1i43wv) and even a [Laundry concept](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1i43wv/concept_nes_passcode/cb0u5wc). Until now only developers have been able to actually implement these things, with XPasscode that is no longer true. Anyone can make them happen with ease.

### Video (a week old version)

###Giveaway info
Include your cydia id in a comment. I will pick random people during the span of ~24-48 hours (to make sure everyone gets a chance) and gift the tweak to them. I might hand out some others too - piano passcode,ncenough,stoppur,instalauncher if someone really wants them.

###XPasscode what is it?
This is a tweak much like ""Piano passcode"", ""Control unlocker"" and some more. It changes the keypad on your device to *whatever you want*, so if you want to click on a picture of yourself you can do that. Tap your nose 3 times to unlock. 

Basically, anyone can make their own theme. Just add your own pictures and tell the theme where the ""click"" areas are and put it on your device and .. voila. (Don't worry there are/will be tutorials and documentation for everything).

### How do I create themes?
As I said there will be tutorials / doocumentation available. Head over to /r/xpasscode for more info.

### Where can I download themes?
For now I have a private repo (link in /r/xpasscode) but I themes can be downloaded from anywhere. I have gotten a go-ahead from ModMyi to put themes on their repo also!

### I don't like ""themes""
Me neither. Luckily for us, XPasscode actually assembles/loads/creates each ""theme"" into a real object at start, so with XPasscode they are just as good as a native tweaks (Piano passcode/Control unlocker etc). 

*In fact, the code used in XPasscode is in many ways even better than Piano passcode and I will carry over code from XPasscode for future updates in Piano passcode.*

**Updates:**
---

**Themes created by Redditors list**

&gt;~~I've been planning on updating [this](http://redd.it/1amzfq) for a while, but real life got the better of me among other things. I'll be updating it sometime this weekend or next week, and it'll be moved to the Reddit wiki system.~~

&gt; **Edit 8/5/13**: I'm currently [adding it to the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/wiki/redditthemes), it should be done by the end of the day.

**Special flair for those who have created themes**

&gt;After moving the theme list to the wiki, everybody on the list will be receiving flair. If you are not currently on the list (most likely because it hasn't been updated in forever), please do not worry. There's a good chance I've saved the theme you submitted. Please only contact me about not receiving flair *after* I've announced that I've set it for everyone.

---

**New Items:**
---

**AutoModerator is spreading its robotic influence**

&gt;We're considering adding AutoModerator to /r/iOSthemes. The need isn't that great since there isn't really much to be done in terms of moderation work, but we'll see.

**Link Flair**

&gt;This is something that I've had in mind for a few weeks now, and /u/Synchronizing recently suggested it to us in modmail. Basically, the idea is that with link flair, posts will all be text and color coded. This will make it easier for Redditors to find content that they want to see both while browsing and searching.

&gt;Unfortunately if you browse Reddit exclusively via Alien Blue (and some other Reddit apps), you won't benefit much from this since AB doesn't show link flair. That's just how things go, there isn't much that can be done about it on our part.

&gt;This will probably come in the next month or so (probably longer since I suck at keeping deadlines) and then we'll spend the next couple months afterwards testing it out and seeing how it works. If it's good, people seem to like it, and isn't too much additional work, then it will be added to /r/jailbreak as well. If not, then it'll be scrapped or kept only in /r/iOSthemes.

**Sidebar**

&gt;Something about making it prettier and more readable.

**Best Setup Contest for August**
---

**About**

&gt;As mentioned in [this post](http://redd.it/1hlak1), I'd like to give this a try for the month of August and see how it works out. Here's how the contest will work:

&gt; 1. If you submit a setup in August, you're entered. No need to do anything differently (such as mentioning you're entering in the title).
2. At the end of the month, the 10 setups that have the highest score will be the finalists
3. You will have the opportunity to vote on your 3 favorite setups out of the 10.
4. The 3 setups that get the most votes will earn their OPs special flair, sort of akin to gold, silver, and bronze medals.

**Rules** (tl;dr bolded)
&gt; 1. **You can only have one set up in the top 10.** You can submit multiple set ups to /r/iOSthemes in a given month, but if more than one of your setups is in the top 10, only the highest scoring one will be considered.
2. **Please don't try to cheat votes.** If I suspect issues with malicious downvoting or attempting to rig votes (either by using alts to upvote or downvote posts), then the entire thing is canceled and will be considered a failed event. 
3. **Please don't use fake accounts.** In order to prevent cheating via submissions from multiple accounts, only setups submitted by accounts created before August are valid. Also, all you're getting is flair, there's no point winning the contest with a fake account.

&gt;**Exception for this month since it's our first contest:** I understand that people don't change their setups very often. If you submitted a setup in the month of July and don't feel like changing things up again just so you can be entered in the contest for August PM me before August 17th. If your submission has a score higher than the 7th ranked post for August, you'll be added as a finalist.

**Closing**

&gt;Obviously, this is a new thing. Details haven't been ironed out, so issues will arise. If for whatever reason this doesn't really seem to work very well, then we simply won't do this after August. Winners will still get to keep their flair. Main issues I'm worried about:

&gt; * An overall decrease in the number of setups submitted especially towards the end of the month
* People downvoting posts simply because they want to win
* Subreddit atmosphere becoming unfriendly (which really is the last thing anybody wants)
* Issues with vote cheating

&gt;Alternatively, if it does work well but doesn't seem to warrant a monthly event (or maybe it just ends up being too much work), then it'll just turn into an end of the year event to be held after Jan 1st.

&gt;I'm aware that this will probably turn into a flat theme circlejerk, but there's nothing I can really do about that. I understand not using a flat theme is a bit of a handicap, but if [your setup is really creative, then you'll get the upvotes you deserve](http://redd.it/1d4d06).",,False,self,t5_2w997,1375734368.0,,,True,t3_1jeshr,http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/1jeshr/meta_updates_new_items_and_augusts_best_setup/,moderator

We are very pleased to announce many major changes in iMIUI v1.1.3! Thanks to you, our theme has grown tremendously so we feel it's time for a little housekeeping: our main theme is now more organised and easier to use from Winterboard. Many elements have been moved and can be found separately from our repo.

For example, the Auxo theme is now a separate package seeing as not everyone has Auxo installed. As well as that, we have a bunch of new features in this version. For instance, thanks to /u/seanfletchr and his great piece of code, our lockscreens and iWidgets are much similar to those in MIUI! You can read the full changelog [from our website](http://onehalfkiller.com/imiui/downloads/changelog/) or on our repo.

I have a Nexus 7 and an IPhone and now, both their lockscreens look pretty similar. I noticed, however, that when you're dragging the handler around on the iPhone's Jellylock, the handler is a smooth gradient, however, on my Nexus 7 the handler is a bunch of dots with a gradient applied to make them look like a circle. If you're like me and notice these little things, you might want to download this image: http://imgur.com/BFR9Q6u, name it jellylock_handler_active@2x.png, and put it in one of Jellylock's theme folders. Make sure the original file is renamed before you replace it with this one! I hope someone out there is as neurotic as me about this sort of thing.
Here's an example of it in use: http://imgur.com/HuxLt7t

EDIT: Here's a different version that is more circular. It also has different sizes of circles, so one larger circle is centered, with a ring of smaller circles around it, etc. Here's the link: http://imgur.com/f1iFiCT",,False,self,t5_2w997,1366664321.0,,,True,t3_1cukh1,http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/1cukh1/androidstyle_jellylock_active_handler/,

Can an awesome somebody make a thread that lists all the ""major/recommended"" addons/plugins/themes that are commonly featured on /r/iOSthemes? I think it would help a lot of people out

Sometimes it gets confusing knowing what's what, and what came from where, as people get things from different places, and aren't always specific. If someone who has the time and wants to could put together a specific list of recommended themes, plugins, etc., that would be incredibly awesome AND helpful to all new jailbreakers (and experienced people, too!).

I sort of imagine it as split into a few different sections... like **Themes (Winterboard)**, **Lock Screen Plugins**, **Widgets**, **Plugins**, etc., I don't know. As long as it's specific and tells users where they can get the themes/plugins, etc. etc. Interpret it as you want.

JUST AN IDEA TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE OUT, especially those who aren't as experienced and aren't familiar with where to get things (such as myself). If anyone has the time/wants to do it, I would love you forever.",,False,self,t5_2w997,False,,,True,t3_1crmwf,http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/1crmwf/can_someone_make_a_thread_that_lists_all_the/,
