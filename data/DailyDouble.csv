In under 2 weeks we have grown far and beyond our wildest dreams! As a special thanks, we are announcing the start of ***Final Jeopardy!***

Every Friday starting TODAY the mods will post a ***Double Jeopardy!*** answer. Make your responses count here guys, because the top 3 commenters each week will be entered into the ***Final Jeopardy!*** contest at the end of the month.


Here's what you need to know:


* *Everyone is eligible to participate* in the weekly ***Double Jeopardy!*** contests (except the mods...). All you need to do is post a response and you're in!
The top three commenters from each week will move on to the ***Final Jeopardy!*** round at the end of the month.


* ***Final Jeopardy!*** will be held between these ***Double Jeopardy!*** winners as well as the previous month's winner and the user who has the highest upvoted comment of the month. Only these contestants will be able to leave comments in the ***Final Jeopardy!*** post. However, everyone else will be able to participate by voting for their favorite response.

* The winner will receive a month's worth of **Reddit Gold**. As well as a trophy flair that when hovered over will show the month and year they won (ooooooh, aahhhhhh). Good luck to all of you!

Yours faithfully, *Alex Trebek*

(Also, if you contestants could go ahead and upvote this for visibility, that'd be great.)

Answer: ""~~This is~~ Manberry Fudge""

By removing the ""This is"", the response feels more natural. So, when should you use ""This""? When you need to identify a type of something.

Based on an earlier suggestion to spice things up a bit with categories, this is my effort to add an extra challenge for you when thinking of a response. Taking a page from some of the actual puns used as ""Jeopardy!"" categories, I came up with this. Instead of using ""four-letter words,"" which might lead you down the road to vulgarities and obscenities, I made it ""FOUR-WORD LETTERS."" 

To explain: ""It's a letter (as in, correspondence) which contains four words.""  -/u/CypherAlmasy

It's that simple. I don't know why the four-word responses are being down-voted (unless you just don't like them on their own merit - which is your prerogative), but they shouldn't be if you're misreading the category. So if this is you, kindly stop it. lol
