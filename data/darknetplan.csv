Why not name it something that doesn't sound evil and computer-hacker-ish? Maybe I'm wasting my breath and ""darknet"" is just big on this subreddit, but if the media reports on this, wouldn't it be better if it had a more positive name like ""freenet"" or ""libertyweb"" or whatever instead of ""the Darknet""? Remember, most people's understanding of this entire concept will be limited to a headline and maybe 2 sentences describing it-- if they know of it only as ""darknet"" and ""a network of computers that the government can't regulate,"" that's not going to help.

EDIT:

1) It's been pointed out that both [FreeNet](https://freenetproject.org/) and [AlterNet](http://www.alternet.org/) are names already associated with a specific entity or project. 

2) A lot of people have said ""so what? I like that it doesn't appeal to the mainstream?"" Keeping in mind point 3 below, I'd be interested in hearing the pros and cons of having a larger population using or supporting the project or its product. I guess I assumed that widespread adoption would improve content and facilitate investments in technology.

3) I am not involved with this movement, although on a very superficial level I think it's a great idea. I posted this as an outside observer-- I kind of meant to quietly make a suggestion to a few people in the project, and if it resonated, I figured they would take it from there.

I definitely did not intend to detract from the project itself by starting a naming controversy.

I wrote this post in /solar and was suggested I cross-post here. I love the idea of creating ""your own internet"", especially a solar powered one. I'm still new at all of this, but this is what i've done so far, and I'd be happy to help anyone else along to build something bigger and better than mine:

[Picture of setup](https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/398840_913748673415_24400384_39285423_1191148155_n.jpg)

This is it. After much learning and experimenting my wifi Wikipedia Server / messaging service is setup. It features: 

Legend:

1. 30 watt monocrystalline solar panel 
2. 30 Amp solar charge controller (supports up to 450 watts).
3. Watt's Up DC electricity consumption meter to measure actual watts / peak watts / amps going to the battery.
4. 85 Amp hour deep-cycle battery
5. Another Watt's Up meter to measure actual DC load coming off the battery.
6. 400 watt DC-to-AC inverter 
7. AC Kill A Watt electric usage monitor to measure / compare AC/DC conversion loss and track total hours / watts consumed 
8. Buffalo Wifi router with custom WRT firmware to redirect connected devices to the wifi to server 
9. Small web server running Debian, hosting a text-only offline version of Wikipedia, a web-based messaging system. (Modified NSLU2)

Stats:

* Total operating electricity consumption: ~10 watts. 
* Total cost in parts: ~$480 (including misc cabling and connectors)
* Given [5 hours of sun](http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/reno-nevada.html) the setup can generate about 150 Wh, and, factoring inefficiency, consumes about 240 Wh in a given 24 hour period (10 * 24). Starting with a fully charged battery it should last longer than a week straight meeting my requirements. 
* I could investigate adding another 30 or even 100 watt solar panel to be able to last indefinitely as well as charge phones and other devices without worry of running down the server.

I was a total noob when I started this project. Barely knew the different between AC and DC power. I also learned a lot from asking questions on [http://electronics.stackexchange.com](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/19707/powering-a-30-watt-computer-in-the-middle-of-the-desert). Very helpful and thorough guys.

I don't think I've seen one post explaining things in all the time I've been subscribed to this subreddit (which isn't that long, only a few weeks, but that's beside the point). Many times i have seen people criticizing individuals who haven't been formally educated/who don't already know everything about this. Honestly, that's a problem. I would have thought you guys would want as many people in as possible and would be eager to help other people learn. It's going to be pretty much unrealistic if you try to run this as only a small, defensive, almost tight-knit group of programmers. You're going to need as much help as you can get.

I've already read the basic-introductions Google document, and the one that gets more in-depth with the technology of it. It's a really good idea. I like the thinking here. But, as I said before, nobody's learning anything. The more technological document wasn't just ""more technological"", it probably requires a degree in computer science to understand. I mean, I suppose I could do all the research and teach it to myself via Google, Wikipedia, and the like, but that would waste so much time and would only teach me specifically. 

I know for a fact I can't be the only one here who is a little confused about some things. 

Thank you, if you actually understand the point I'm trying to make here and try to help. I know I may just sound like an idiot, and maybe it's more simple than I realize to just go and learn it all myself. 

It's seriously not going to work if no one is willing to help other people learn and if no one is willing to open up to other people who want to help. It's not going to get off the ground if it's just a small group of people.

Again, thank you. And I'd appreciate it if you don't criticize me for not understanding or generally be a dick about things.

But it seems to me that you're approaching this from the wrong angle and thus getting yourself painted into a corner.


**1. Optimistic worst case assumptions.**

It seems to me that you're assuming that ""things won't get too bad"", that you'll always be able to run wireless routers to exchange encrypted data.  But it hardly seems too far-fetched for some future bad-guy government to demand your wireless password, and to show up at your door if they can't decode your traffic.  If you're going to go to all the effort of creating a darknet, you'd hate to waste all that work if the government demands to see your wireless traffic, or even simply banned wireless routers (as already happened for a while in 2008 in China).


**2. Chicken and egg problem.**

All the schemes so far require some critical density of Darknet nodes in your neighborhood to work.  As people have pointed out, this makes it easy to disrupt, but it also means that it's never going to be useful in developing countries, and that it won't be useful to ""the average guy"" until there are literally millions of users.

How are we going to get those users with nothing concrete to offer?


**3. Hardware transport layer issues.**

A lot of the issues being discussed relate to the hardware transport layer.

Wifi (i.e. radio) has a lot of benefits, but it also has a lot of drawbacks as we have discovered - it seems like a bad idea to commit yourself to one specific hardware transport layer so very early.


**4. The network topology.**

I can certainly see the advantages of a mesh topology, but again, I don't see why this should be decided so early.


**Invert your assumptions!**

So let's start by turning a lot of the ideas on Darknet completely upside down.

Let's assume:

* Darknet should be useful even if there are only two nodes in it.
* Darknet should be hardware transport-layer agnostic - in other words, it should be possible to implement Darknet routing through any hardware channel.
* Sets of Darknet nodes should be allowed to use their own routing and connection strategies, not just a mesh topology.
* Sets of Darknet nodes should be allowed to use their own encryption and authentication strategies.

**Just the right level of generality?**

But wait, you cry, haven't I made this completely general?  What's left?  What can we agree on?

Well, even if different Darknet nodes are using different hardware transport layers, different routings, connections, and all that, we do want the possibility of interoperation between any two nodes.

That means first that we have to agree on the top-level protocol - what our ""packets"" look like.

And while we aren't agreeing on our routing, we do need to agree on our addressing!  A flexible way of identifying addresses is required, one which allows for broadcasts from anonymous individuals, or messages from public individuals to anonymous individuals and so on.

More subtly, while we will perhaps not be agreeing on strategies for transport layers, encryption, and all that, if we need to interoperate we need to agree on the _names_ for our specific strategies - so one node can negotiate strategies with another one.

Then we can start working on specific hardware channels and software services.

**Advantages to the generalized problem.**

* I'm a huge fan of [steganography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography). Part of the reason that I'm proposing a more general framework is that I'm a firm believer in the idea of hiding the information in plain sight - and the fact that I didn't see a way in the current Darknet scheme to hide Darknet traffic within other, more innocuous traffic.
* It seems to me that we have more software people than hardware people, and yet with the current plan we have little for the software people to do until the hardware is ready.  Once we abstract away the ""multiple little radios"" it'd be really easy to make a lot of virtual software Darknet nodes on your own machine and then experiment with your own routing schemes, encryption, topologies and that sort of thing.
* By having an abstract hardware layer, it encourages people to write their own implementations of transport layers.  Possible ideas include wireless routers, line-of-sight lasers, all sorts of steganographic ideas as I mentioned before, megahertz audio (which is tightly directional), a plain old wire, ""acoustic"" encoding using plain-old-telephone style modems, and exotic things like encoding/decoding into Morse.

**Thanks for reading!**

This is a noble undertaking and I'm all for it!  I welcome your comments and questions.

What Can I do to help?,415,58,173,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/14ihxs/i_am_an_electronics_and_network_engineer_with/,"I posted a thread under a very similar name a few months ago. I felt very welcome but nothing productive came from it. Here is what I can do to help.

1. Engineer stuff. Tell me what you want and I will design it

2. Mass produce stuff. I will have access to a pick and place machine in  a few months pending loans and the right price. This will happen, credit history and a proven track record are there.

3. Design new protocols. Several of my friends are very skilled programmers and in favor of a darknet.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nah4BQ9y8IY

The machine wont be as nice as this one and my solder oven can only do about 8 square feet of boards an hour. 

If you help me design the product that will be your messiah I promise that it will be manufactured only slightly above cost. Money doesnt make me happy, just warm and fed. The design can be open if the hivemind thinks that it is best.

One thing that I dont want to get hung up on is data rate. It seems that goals are set way too high. Range, resilience to enemies and ease of access are the most important aspects IMO of a viable darknet. 

Edit: Tell me the specs, features and price point you want and this device can be on your table in a matter of a few months and mass production in a year or two. Sooner with a successful kickstarter or other fundraising type of deal.

Extra Edit: Thank you all very much for the input. Im going to go mostly solo on this and stop replying to most of the comments. If you have something very important to add then feel free to post. Ill update you guys when I have something for you. I made the mistake of thinking that a darknet also applied to emergencies but you guys seem to think that its a means of preserving the net as it exists today which is great but my area of interest lies more in disaster situations. Im not active on this board so if at a later date you need circuit design just PM me.

My goal as it currently stands is to set up a 10mile radius of communication with a BBS type of service that uses a GUI without using an antenna that exceeds 20'. This seems to be within reason.

The explanation that Reddit was protecting itself from legal issues was semi-plausible, but it is clear from their message that the main reason they destroyed these boards was because they felt that they were morally reprehensible, and this gave them a right to remove them. I fail to see how this is any different than the Chinese government blocking political sites or the Iranian government blocking haraam sites.

I am a ""member"" of civic association called Pilsfree. It is a community network providing Internet connection to its 18K+ members (approx. 10% of the city's population). AFAIK It is the largest community network in my country. It started as an alternative to atrocious service of commercial providers, but it is giving them headache now.  
My provider does not have to log my IP (this might differ elsewhere), I know my sub-network admin in person, I get 50+Mbit connection on an average day, I can use several Pilsfree WiFi hotspots around the city etc. All that for 15$ per month.

edit: I forgot we also have fully legit IPTV. plus there might be some DC hubs, private SMB, game servers etc. running within the network.

I simply don't have the time or expertise to contribute to the project substantially enough to deserve a moderator title. It has been an honor seeing such an incredible response to this subreddit and to see so many amazing people discuss and work towards this ideal. I hope with one inactive moderator gone, I can open the door for a new strong, active leader. I do ask before I leave that other moderators consider being more active or taking my route. Also, if they could open up new mod applications that would also be cool to see.

Here's why, and how to fix it:",281,57,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/mij5r/darknet_in_its_current_state_will_fail_heres_why/,"1. **Naming**: Darknet - what do you think of when you hear that? Darkness + Internet. Most convey darkness with something negative - the black market, for example; hell isn't lit up like heaven is, now is it? As has been said time and time again, the name needs to change. It needs to convey your project and be a bright, guiding idea:  
**OpenNet**  
OpenNet is a completely free, open network that is made by and for everyone. It conveys your message - open internet access for all - without bringing negative connotations that darkness would (or, for that matter, an underworld, overworld, etc would). I have registered this subreddit and am prepared to hand it over to the current moderators to do with it what you want (PM if interested).

2. **Ease of Access**: This will prove to be one of the most important factors of the entire project. If you can't access the network quickly and easily you might as well not even do the project. You need to develop a wireless device (such as a router) that I can use to connect my home network to your mesh. It needs to be easy to use (plug and play, or close to it) - just as simple as current routers, if not moreso.

3. **Global Presence**: You lack this completely. Joe Everyman doesn't know how to log onto IRC, but he may like the idea that you have. Your site is down, your official email is 'darknetplan (at) gmail (dot) com'. You need to organize a true leadership, start an organization and begin running this like one. As of finding out about your plan, darknetplan.org has been down; how can I find information without even being able to access your site?

You have a great idea. You need to follow through on your execution.

As many of you have probably noticed, this subreddit has not had a lot of  content recently that aims to further the goals of the Meshnet Plan (some, but not enough). So, I think it is time for an honest discussion between the members of this subreddit on what our goals should be. As SOPA and ProtectIP go through the Senate and House in some fashion, we need to begin our planning for the day when corporations and government censor the internet as they like. On the more outreach and PR side of this project, I have a couple of announcements. But, I believe this post is a good place to discuss technical and overall planning ideas of the movement. First though, here is what I am working on with outreach and organization:

**Consolidation of Anti-Censorship Movements:**

Divided, we don't stand a chance, but with the skills and virtues of all the different anti web censorship projects, we may be able to actually make a difference. I have reached out to a couple of groups already. It is imperative we collect a list of all groups working on this issue, however, if we are going to succeed. If you know of a group we should be working with, please post in the relevant post I have added in the subreddit.


**Meshnet Conferences:**
This will be the year the free web begins, when the first completely individual owned networks are built. To kick this off, I have been working on some possibilities for conferences for those involved in the project. The goal would be to have relevant speakers, workshops, planning sessions, etc in order to allow each attendee to build their own network in their own area. In order to do this, I need the help of the community to reach out to speakers and groups to sponsor and work with the conference in order to make it a success. At the moment, plans are to have the first to conferences in Denver and New York City. My goal would be to have these planned for sometime in the second half of 2012. Please contact me if you have any ideas on how to help plan this.    


Now, I need feedback from all of you on how we can make this work. We need to stop these blatant attempts at censorship, and together we can make a truly free internet.

Time and time again, we get people coming into the subreddit and IRC claiming some all knowing wisdom in the ways of wireless mesh nets, specifically in the area of them being impossible. While we are a community project and thrive off the input of everyone, destructive comments and constant naysaying are ruining the integrity of the IRC discussions. At the risk of sounding like a jerk, allow me to say that you are absolutely wrong for saying wireless mesh nets are impossible.

Wireless mesh nets are not impossible. They are difficult, and sometimes expensive, but they are not even close to impossible. We are not the first to attempt, establish or maintain wireless mesh networks. Here are a few very successful projects that have been brought to my attention in just the last week:

1. [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net/en), a project that already connects a huge portion of Spain, and even has a few remote sites throughout Africa, Europe and Central America.

2. [Friefunk](http://start.freifunk.net/), a German project spanning Leipzig, Hannover, Gadow, Berlin, Rostock and Dresden.

3. [Air-Stream.org](http://www.air-stream.org/), a project in Southern Australia with over 150 nodes spanning over 200 km. Notably, dedicated contributor Tanuki is part of this project.

4. [MIT/Nortel Wireless Mesh Network](http://www.media.mit.edu/sponsorship/getting-value/collaborations/nortel), a very successful project started in 2001, utilizing peer-to-peer WiFi access points, minimizing data loss and dead zones.

5. [The Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network](http://www.awmn.net/), a mesh network that covers almost all of Greece.

6. [South African Wireless Access Groups](http://www.wug.za.net/), A South African project that is very similar to what we are trying to accomplish.

EDIT: I just found [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wireless_community_networks_by_region) wikipedia page, showing a list of all wireless community network.

We could sell shares for Bitcoins, then allow shareholders to vote anonymously on issues like mergers, rate plans, manager elections and stuff. Shareholders would be free to sell their shares to anyone at any time.

We could market it as the Privacy ISP, and help users set up encrypted email... or tor relays... or i2p sites... or ~~torrent trackers~~ wikis

I imagine this would be pretty useful for testing purposes when we have legit meshnet schemes ready to go, too...

EDIT: Everyone is saying ""But, but, but - laws and regulations!""

Fuck laws and regulations.

After reading comments I am now envisioning a DISTRIBUTED ISP. We don't need a central office and we don't need wires - basically, monetizing Meshnet. We distribute a live CD that, while running, hooks you into the mesh. You get paid by peers for the traffic you route through your network.

To me it seems the reason for this is because this project can't work because of some serious fundamental technical flaws.  Mesh networks decrease in throughput and increase in routing complexity with each hop.  If you go more than 4 or 5 hops, you'll have tons of interference and such complicated routing tables that this project will be useless.  That's why wireless mesh ISPs are so complicated to set up.  If this kind of thing worked, every independent ISP would be using this kind of technology and bypassing phone/cable lines because those technologies are expensive and difficult to maintain.  

Am I missing something, or are the subscribers here just ignoring the fundamental flaws of the idea because the end result is very seductive?  I haven't seen any real details, and unless someone has a great idea of how to overcome the need to repeat a signal with each hop, thus consuming more bandwidth on a frequency range that's so full of natural interference that the FCC doesn't even see it as being fit to license, I don't see how you're going to convince technically minded individuals to join on.

And since this movement is about taking back control of the internet, why not take control of our personal data while we're at it?

Imagine this magical little box that promises to give you freedom. The hardware supports a cause to free the internet from corporate and government control, while the software provides you with open source solutions for all your popular web hosted applications. E-Mail, calendar, chat, social networking, blogging, news feeds, wikis, cloud storage and more. This magical device will provide all the hosting, meaning that you own these services and have *control over all your personal data.*

I think this could be a really great selling point for the masses. The box is small enough to carry with you, and it supports fully encrypted remote backup and cloud storage. A complete solution for any person who values their privacy and wants to tell Mark Zuckerberg and Eric Schmidt to go suck on a lemon.

The software suite would include:

[LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) - the main building blocks for any hosting platform. Possibly use PostgreSQL instead.

[Zimbra](http://www.zimbra.com/products/zimbra-open-source.html) - a collaboration server for hosted e-mail, calendar, contacts, and more. A replacement for Gmail, Gcal, and document sharing. Comes with a web interface and exchange support. Simply amazing.

[Z-Push](http://z-push.sourceforge.net/soswp/index.php?pages_id=1&amp;t=home) - an open source ActiveSync server. Allows for full email/calendar/contact sync with any mobile device that supports exchange.

[Diaspora](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Installing-and-Running-Diaspora) - a decentralized social networking platform. You own your data. I'm not sure if it's ready for prime-time though. Might replace this with Elgg.

[Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/download/) - an open source blogging platform with a lot of extensive plugins and themes. The right plugin and theme can turn Wordpress into an eCommerce, news aggregate, Q&amp;A, social network, or any other web platform you can think of. There's even a Craigslist conversion.

[Gallery](http://gallery.menalto.com/) - a media platform that allows you to share photos and videos. You can even let others upload to you. Meant to replace Flickr.

[Syncanny](http://www.syncany.org/) - an open source cloud storage and synchronization tool meant to replace Dropbox with something more secure. Supports many different platforms and protocols, including Amazons S3 and Google Storage.

[MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) - the popular open source wiki engine that runs Wikipedia. Allows you to build and host your own wiki!

[Pligg](http://pligg.com/about/) - an open source news platform with community sharing and voting, much like Digg and Reddit. Has a great CMS and tons of features.

[ProjectPier](http://www.projectpier.org/) - an open source project management system. Similar to ActiveCollab and Basecamp.

[TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) - allows yourself and others to avoid tracking, preserve anonymity and help strengthen the super-seekrit network.

This is all I can think of for now. There's also going to be web-based management like Webmin and other goodies like FTP and SAMBA server. The possibilities are endless! 

Please let me know what you think about this compilation. Are there better software alternatives than what is listed? Am I missing something? I'm looking to put all this software together in a VM and streamline the setup process while waiting for the Raspberry Pi boards to release. If you have anything to add to the list, please let me know!

**--- [Overview]**

Censorship is coming soon to a theater near you.  Before you consider joining the darknet, 
ask yourself: do you have anything worth saying?  Why not just be censored?  I mean, if you
are just planning on watching TV all day tomorrow, it might be a good idea to keep this 
whole thing off your record.  These packets may not be for you.  I say this both with a 
touch of cynicism and seriously.. because I'm worried about people.  If this really is the
card governments are playing then it's going to get nasty.  The only people that are really
cheering us on are already dead.  Or are doing it silently in their heads, biting their lip
so their father, mother, wife or husband doesn't see.  

The good news, you get to be the good guys.  You know, the ones that face insurmountable 
odds and overcome that adversity to resolve their problems and live happily ever after.  Yep 
those.  If you've read this far, chances are you're probably one of them.  It comes with a 
cost though, and if you have anything to lose (personally, my freedom is the most important),
you might want to reconsider.  That's the last time I'll say anything to dissuade you.  By
this point I'll assume you've weighed the pros and cons, are OK with the idea of going to 
GITMO and never seeing any of your family, and friends again, or worse, being tried for your
beliefs in front of family and friends and watching them hate you, then being thrown over
hot coals and BBQ'd and then turned into a reality tv special that everyone can fap to while
congratulating themselves on how normal and functional they are.

This may be for people you care about.  Is your kid really smart?  They might end up not fitting
the mold that you cast with your silence.  They might end up getting themselves killed with their
ideas.  With their love for humanity, with their pushing things forward.  Do you want to live in
a world where people are done away with for their ideas?  Do you want to bring back the Salem
witch trials?  I'm not trying to scare you.  I'm trying to understand your aims.  You seem to be
so distracted.  Are you even paying attention?

Oh he's such a bright lad, he'll figure it out.

**--- [Vocab]**

*Network*: A bunch of computers connected together

*Internet*: A bunch of networks connected together

*Darknet*: A bunch of computers connected together purposely excluding Internet access to its content.

*Content*: Data that's hosted.  Files, Documents, Text.  For example, this file is content.

*Transport*: How information is moved around.  Cables, Radio Transmissions (WiFi), Encapsulating Protocols (CJDNS), etc.

*Hospital*: A big building with patients

*Cryptography*: A system used to encipher messages such that unintended audiences cannot decipher them.  In theory the ciphertext (encrypted message) and the cleartext (decrypted message) are isometric (equivalent) so long as you have the key. But without the key, they seem entirely unrelated.  This is not always true and one might keep a healthy suspicion of backdoors or fatal weaknesses in most available cryptographic software.

*Symmetric Crypto*: Cryptography that uses the same key to encrypt as it does to decrypt

*Public Key Crypto*: Cryptography that uses the unique mathematical properties of elliptical curves or prime numbers to separate the key used to encrypt (Public) from the key used to decrypt (Private).  Private and public keys are also a practical way to ascertain the identity of entities (you, people) performing in or on electronic mediums (the internet, CompuServ).

*Freedom*: $1.05, available at your local Walmart.

**--- [Current Situation]**

We are trading our personal information to a few large corporations in exchange for connectivity
and user interfaces we're used to.  Before thinking about it, it feels too good to be true, like
the people who use Google, Facebook, and the like are getting a way better deal than the companies
that offer the services.  What could they possibly be gaining?  And look at what we've gotten for
free!  Hah!  We made off like bandits.

While we're right, the trade is unfair, it is not unfair in that intuitive way.  We are not 
getting something for nothing.  We're definitely getting something for something.  That something
is a quantified representation of our behavioral patterns that allows for an eerily complete 
picture of who and what we are.

One trend that concerns me most is the intersection between entitlement, domestic productivity,
foreign productivity, and compromised privacy.  A domestic company with data like Google's could
easily seize power in our security-obsessed society.  Under the guise of keeping us safe they 
could silently blackmail us all into paying for reputation insurance or something along these 
lines.  The amount you pay would of course be proportional to what you had to lose, as with all 
insurance.  It'd be relatively cheap to keep the average man's search history from his wife 
(think car insurance, maybe $200/mo at most), for example, but if you were running for office 
or trying to do anything in the public sphere?  Expect to fork over the cash accordingly.

The reason this model might come into play is the average American's purchasing power has been
weighted down by debt and our productivity has slumped.  The retail economy will eventually 
collapse, and with it the advertising budgets will collapse as well.  

The truth is, we've constructed big brother.  We've just all been sold on the lie that it can 
only be used for advertising.  Something that is simply not true.  It's mind blowing how hidden
in plain sight this weapon is.  In fact it's so threatening, and so emotionally compromising to
even consider it most people won't even entertain the thought that it is a weapon.  To put it 
in the framework of a 90s action movie.  Imagine this happy scientist who loves his family, let's
imagine he's played by Will Smith.  He develops this amazing breakthrough technology that saves
all these people money by streamlining all of these processes by using personal data.  He's 
celebrated as a hero and settles into his awesome life as a successful scientist when some foreign
soldiers kidnap his wife and kid and hold them hostage.  They want access to his system in order
to extract data on their ex leader.  Blah blah blah.

Now swap Will Smith with Larry Page.  Swap the foreign soldiers for Blackwater, Haliburton, etc.

Swap the caring public with this lathargic, depressed mass.  These months we are living are the 
months where that power swap will take place.  They are implying the power now.  They are 
attempting to take it globally.  They have the technical means.  This system has been, in my mind
technically feasible for probably the last 10 years.  And I could have written a comprehensive
surveillence system myself in that time.  If I could have written it alone, it is a safe bet that
it exists.  Probably in a shockingly more sophisticated form.  Cisco has been making gear for deep
packet inspection for years.  Storage is fast and cheap.  Crypto hasn't been overhauled or 
considered in the public eye for at least 10 years.  Does this alarm you?  Do you still trust RSA?
Do you remember Bill Clinton's calls for key escrow?  The arguments that ensued?  Do you remember
when the NSA suddenly stopped pestering Phil Zimmerman? 

This is happening now.

**--- [Strategy]**

Do not underestimate the opponent.  Especially since all that R&amp;D $$ went into the security
industry after 9/11.  This, everything else, everything you do is being monitored.  When 
they can't decipher your cryptographic traffic, they do what's called traffic analysis.
Which can detect what a type of traffic looks like.  Large, full packets one after another 
in rapid succession from one IP to another looks like a Server -&gt; File file transfer, while
lots of full packets from lots of sources to one IP might look like a Torrent file transfer.

It's not just what you say, it's how you say it.  And saying it through hard-to-break
cryptography makes at least two extra statements (in addition to the one you used the crypto
to make).  It says ""I kind of know what I'm doing"" (red flag?), and it says ""I have or might
have something to hide in the future"" (red flag!).

I joined the darknet, and so can you!

Ingredients: 
 - One Internets, Whole, bone-in
 - Some People Who Care About Our Freedoms
 - Open Source Cryptograpic Seasonings
 - Open Source Other Things (Linux, MasBSD, ä¸­åŽäººæ°‘å…±å’Œå›½ OS X, etc)
 - A Large Pair of Balls (figurative, though canned is ok since they're not in season)

With these ingredients you can join a darknet or create your own.  Keep in mind, that 
as soon as you do join you might be labeled a child molester or a terrorist just for
joining, but never mind that quite yet.

[I made a post in /r/technology which has gained a lot of steam](https://pay.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/11297d/us_wired_internet_providers_are_implementing_data/), with a [comment here outlining my stance on the subject](https://pay.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/11297d/us_wired_internet_providers_are_implementing_data/c6inclp).

The best idea put forward so far is to [create municipal Internet Service Providers](https://pay.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/11297d/us_wired_internet_providers_are_implementing_data/c6iqhs6?context=1), and i completely agree.

So I created the community [r/MunicipalISP](http://reddit.com/r/municipalisp) in the hopes that we can use it to organize and ultimately create locally owned/controlled Internet Service Providers without bandwidth caps, creepy tracking and piss-poor data rates.

I think darknetplan is an ideal match for this project, as it's all about self-organization and create a revolution in internet access. I think municipal Internet Service Providers may not be the ultimate solution, but it's definitely a step in the right direction.

This makes it absolutely essential that we very strictly stay within FCC standards and the law.

Now, on to my main point: a lot of people are suggesting things like putting nodes out in the ""wild"", like hidden in bushes, trees, or on telephone poles, or maybe even on the exterior of buildings. If all these nodes are out and exposed like this, I can guarantee that some people will start questioning them and there are going to be a few ""accidents"" that may ""accidentally"" take down the nodes and might just happen to reveal all the personal information of anyone who was using that node. Basically, having exposed nodes out in the open is a dangerous idea. The only way to keep the nodes secure is to hide them inside of buildings and private property. If a node is inside your own house, that would be ideal because no one can do a damn thing about it if they don't like it, assuming you're not breaking and FCC regulations. If you need to setup a node elsewhere, see if you can find someone to volunteer to hide a mesh node in their house or building.

  I've been reading about the progression of the Darknet plan, and I'm excited to see it make its way along.  I know it's going to be a while before it is something that can be widely adopted.

  Back in the day, I worked for a small company that made mesh routing gear, and I'm familiar with the advantages and limitations.

  About a year ago, I built a little wireless link so that I could share my internet connection with my neighbor, who at the time was not in a position to afford her own internet service.  I went down to Fry's, bought an 8dBi omni antenna kit, and found a Linksys AP on Ebay for about 15 bucks.  I installed the antenna on my roof, and have it coming in through a hole pre-drilled from my former dish service, which I caulked up once the wire was fished through.

  My neighbor has since been able to afford her own internet, so I have a perfectly working 8dBi omni link on my roof that has a service range of almost 1/3 of a mile through a fairly dense suburban area.

  I also happen to have an old desktop PC that I got from a previous employer when they were doing an upgrade.  This PC is otherwise worthlessly outdated, but to serve as a grey-box router, it has enough horsepower to get the job done.

  So, all I really need is either firmware for a router/AP or software for a Linux based router, and I have the other pieces already in place to cover a fairly sizable chunk of my neighborhood.  My total investment, not including the P4 desktop PC, which was free, was about $50, but only because I had some difficulties finding the right adapters to go from my antenna cable to an older connector.

  That said, it's been about 10 years since I worked in wireless engineering.  Back then, I designed links for rural nodes using rip2 mesh routing.  I haven't had a chance to read up on the advances in mesh, but back then, each link in a node caused a relative bandwidth reduction of about half, once throughput, half duplex comms, and encryption were considered.  Is this still the case?  I will be Googling the subject in my spare time, whenever that happens, but if there have been advances in this area, and someone can link me to a whitepaper on it, I would be much appreciative.

  Meanwhile, if people can put together a kit like what I happen to have, I think we would be in a much better position to move forward with this project, once some of the more basic issues have been worked out.  Of course, that's just, like, my opinion, man.

~~I bought one~~ I bought the high powered (1W) version, as well as another one of my friends, we're going to link them together and **hope to** broadcast a useable wireless for nearly 80% of our town.  

We'll be using the inexpensive Alfa 15dbi 2.4 omni as seen [here](http://www.amazon.com/Alfa-Hi-Gain-Omni-Directional-Outdoor-Antenna/dp/B0046CBR3W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337623373&amp;sr=8-1). My equipment should be here in the next couple days, after I get it installed I will test it and report back.

EDIT-  I'm also trying to find a decent priced higher gain antenna to put with the laptop (USB preferably).  I'm not able to allow outside access to my network because I work for the ISP and they wouldn't be happy about it, but will be able to test and report back range, and signal quality, for those of you that are fortunate enough to use this properly.

UPDATE : My radio showed up today, my antenna was here Friday.  I'm going to try to get it installed tonight and begin my testing.

UPDATE 2 : My radio was DoA.  Got my refund and bought a new one.  The one I purchased before was a used one from ebay.  Found a place to get them new for $69 shipped [here.](http://www.streakwave.com)  It should be here tomorrow or Tuesday (today is 6/3/12/)

Update 3 : Have everything installed and running.  I was hoping to test different channel spectums, but it turns out my laptop only supports 20MHZ.   I'm able to go about .2 of a mile from my house before I run into issues.  That issue is a large masonry building blocking my signal.  This is also with the laptop in the cab of my pickup.  I saw a big change just outside of my house by moving it to the outside of the truck.  I'm assuming that it's only the return signal that is having problems, as I'm seeing ping times of 1-4ms until it just drops out completely, this is through a few trees without a problem.  It's also able to connect to my DroidX phone from this distance.  Tells me that this thing line of sight has a whole lot more to offer.  I'm going to be purchasing my high power USB wifi adapter next Wednesday, we'll see how much this helps.  After reading up on this setup a little more.  Line of sight distance is supposed to be roughly .6 miles. ",,False,self,t5_2rju2,1338955199.0,,,True,t3_txld9,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/txld9/so_this_exists/,

I believe that it may be more practical to attempt a darknet/internet hybrid (for now). Imagine that the darknet mesh handles a sort of initial handshake/key exchange (also could perform a secure/trusted DNS lookup of sorts) and then the bulk of the actual encrypted data transfer takes place over the existing internet. This would require an evesdropper to monitor both darknet AND internet traffic to even determine the sort of data being sent. Packets sent via the internet could even masquerade as something else.

This method could fall back to pure darknet usage if it failed to connect over the internet, and transition to pure darknet usage in the future, when hardware matures.

I haven't thought through all edge cases in this idea, and I'd like to feedback, especially around potential breaking points/theoretical problems.

So that your information is not construct to company/corporation/government policies. I want to make an e-mail service that will provide service only through a private secure network. It will not be open to the internet in general. I will also need a way for it to pay for its hosting, this is not for profit. But I would need a way for the service to be self-sufficient as it is used and grows, I cannot sink money into it.

The idea just sparked for me, what would I need to do to kick something like this off? Obviously I will need the following-

-Server Hardware (I have 13 PowerEdge 1850's laying around, may not be enough to start??)

-Network connection (the hardest part, finding a secure connection to the interwebs that will allow me to host and run a secure service without exposing itself??)

-Software (not a clue where to start, suggestions?)

-??

I threw this together as I thought of it, I have probably missed a lot. Please add what you would and ask away!


**Edit:** So I have thought a bit more about this. The final goal of a service like this is to enable the private exchange of e-mails, messages and files through the use of the internet. This *could* be limited to a single meshnet, but that wouldn't enable it to serve a decent purpose. (unless it can be shared between meshnets)

I am fairly new to this entire idea, so bear with my ignorance, and hopelly some of you can answer my questions. 

--How secure is a VPN? I understand all data gets routed through your ISP, but with proper encryption all possible privacy breaches/concerns can be alleviated?

--Can a single meshnet node, or a single meshnet be ""tunneled"" through existing infrastructure to other meshnets in other cities without risking intrusion? (Read: 1024bit RSA encryption)? This would need a single node access point. So that if any breach occurs it can be de-peered and dropped.

--If a Private encrypted tunnel can be made between meshnets, to transmit low-medium bandwidth data, an e-mail service can be created to be meshnet-only?

Writing what comes to mind as I mull this over.

**Edit 2:** when I say a meshnet only service, I mean meshnot only. If you are on a meshnet with 3 or more nodes (shouldnt be to hard to get running, if you have someone with a bit of knowledge involved and 3 people within general viewdistance and 5KM +- 4KM) you will be able to connect to this service and have this service within your net. **again, I may be compleatly daydreaming here since I'm quite new... I think I have a grasp on the general meshnet architecture, though I could be misguided**

Besides the lack of coordinated effort (which is difficult until you actually have something sensible to work on), the biggest issue for this project that has not been solved by anyone in any of the other projects of it's type is addressing.  Look, I get it that you are all well meaning and excited about this.  But I'm going to give myself a concussion from face palming if I see one more post about an antenna or, worse yet, that DNS is needed to really get this thing going.

It's not.  The basis of a network is being able to reach all of the nodes in it.  This is accomplished with addressing and routing.  Any wide area network that is constrained by bandwidth (basically all of them) can not simply broadcast traffic from each node to all other nodes.  That means you need to designate gateway routers, and gateway routers need to be able to find each other and know what is reachable behind them.  They need to do this in a way that doesn't consume all of the available bandwidth along the way.  They need to be coordinated, so they are all using unique space, and all of the clients behind them must be doing so as well if they are to be globally reachable.  This is _the_ unsolved issue with making a scalable mesh network.

Which brings up another point: is it a design goal of this project that all nodes should be reachable form all other nodes?  Or do you want to have large nodes that hand out addresses that are NATed?  This makes a huge difference.  It creates points of failure but also reduces complexity.  It's something that needs to be decided on, but still doesn't solve the core issue.

When networks scale, routing advertisements become a significant traffic factor.  When you are operating on low bandwidth links, it is critically important that you control this.  When you are operating on links that may disappear at any time or flap you need to control how those route announcements and withdrawals are handled by the routing nodes or the entire network turns into a cacophony of routing protocol traffic.

The Internet/ARPANET solved some of these issues, but in very inelegant ways that require a centralized authority to hand out addressing, and a hierarchical structure where some nodes are necessarily ""better"" than others.  These nodes must be trusted, or they can cause a lot of problems for everyone else.  These nodes must control their down streams to some extent to limit problems.  Is that the way to do it for a darknet?  Probably not.  So some real routing/addressing/protocol decisions followed by engineering will have to be done, and some real decisions about what capabilities are critical must-haves and which can be left out needs to occur.

Without a working plan and consensus on the standard protocol suite for this, the project is dead in the water.  It simply can never work anywhere close to the scale I'm reading that many of you imagine it to be capable of.

So that's that.  If this very mundane, boring, not-fun-at-all-to-work-on, tedious task is not completed, no amount of wireless gear, DNS servers and content servers will ever be available to the scale of audience you seem to want to reach.  No end user gear can be chosen, as you don't even know what protocols it will need to run yet.  You don't even know if the end user gear will be different from an upstream node (hint: it will have to be for any sort of scale or it won't have enough RAM to track an address table large enough for any sort of scaling).

Without this, it's like building trains without tracks.  Or building your own tracks only to find out that the guy you are trying to connect to down the road decided to make his tracks a different width than yours because you didn't decide how far apart and what shape rails are supposed to be.",,False,self,t5_2rju2,True,,,True,t3_m2nd5,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/m2nd5/its_the_addressing_stupid/,

I've also been thinking about this exact same issue for a long, long time. 

The best way forward right now is to develop Tomato style firmware for routers that enables automatic establishment of mesh connections with other compatible routers, and provision access for wifi equipped devices across the overlay network. 

The software must be protocol agnostic, and simply select whatever protocol provides compatible service for both users. 

Data transmission must be aware of their location of origin and their location of destination, not just in a network address sense, but in a physical address sense. This will help with routing protocols to avoid flooding.

Everyone seems to just be snatching up every old router they can and throwing 3rd party firmware on it such as DD-WRT, which is all well and good, but once you build a mesh, or a P2MP network, then what?

It's being marketed as a survival tablet but this caught my attention (and is the specific feature I think should become available on more portable devices):

&gt;includes a two-way radio to keep you connected, no matter where you are. Featuring a FRS, GMRS and MURS transceiver, Earl connects to analog and digital radio frequencies up to 20 miles away. Send secure text or voice messages via Walkie-Talkie; even transmit weather, location, and route information

I'd like to see FRS, GMRS and MURS tuners become common in handheld devices. If you could make it use CB frequency as well, we might be on to something. No-cost voice communication anywhere. It wouldn't be secure but FRS and MURS allow for encryption of voice (which means small bursts of data would be indistinguishable from encrypted voice).

And of course it does also have WiFi (b/g/n... it has fucking N). 

Thoughts?

* A waterproof Pelican case with a sheevaplug or similar SoC computer.

* Dual WiFi interface to set up networks and connect to more of these nearby

* Something where you can connect a phone with USB tethering or possibly a 2-way cantenna or something along those lines to get a connection to the rest of the world.

* A Solar Panel and Battery setup to power said devices where power isn't available

In this situation, many are left with no way to get ahold of relatives, resorting to Pay Phones, which don't help when you have all your numbers saved in your now powerless phone and no coins because everything accepts credit and debit.

With something like this, people would be able to use the power they do have left to send word to family telling that they're getting the heck outta there and they're alive/well, and as well find out where others are and what the situation is in other parts of town.

It's been a couple months, I must say my results were less than stellar with this setup.  Using the 15dbi omni I believe has really hurt me as many people stated in the comments of the original post.  With a phone or any other wireless device. I'm about to get about .2 miles away from the antenna before it, for seemingly no reason, just drops off.  3 bars, and then nothing.  I have an 8dbi omni on the way to test this theory.

The setup does do fairly well through most obstructions... Seems to manage tree cover well, as well as general construction building.  (I have a friend with his laptop that can see the network from about .15 miles away through trees and inside his house with 3 bars of coverage everywhere on his laptop.

With my 1W skifi adapter [as seen here](http://www.amazon.com/Alfa-AWUS036H-Upgraded-Wireless-Long-Rang/dp/B000QYGNKQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346086187&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=1w+wireless+card), I'm able to go nearly .5 miles around town before the signal degrades to un-useable.  

Since starting this project, I have started installing [Ubiquiti Picostations](http://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-PicoStation-2-4GHz-802-11g-Access/dp/B0055PKSG6/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346086261&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=picostation).  Recently (last week) I installed one of these on the roof of a friend's house.  It's a 2 story house, and I mounted it on the chimney.  He has a line of sight shot to his shop, which is a brick faced building with concrete cinder block behind the brick.  There is a glass door facing the AP, and a glass front that is at a 90* angle.  The distance is .31 miles according to google earth.  His iphone, ipad, and my laptop were all able to connect to the network from inside the building.  Driving away from the install, I was curious as to how far I could get away with my 1W WNIC.  I ended up 1.2 miles away before the signal was unuseable.

For now, I'm waiting for my 8dbi omni to get here, so I can get it installed and tested.


EDIT : Also, the picostations can be set up to do WDS (Wireless Distribution System), at my friends house, we had the one on his roof, and then put another one in his building and used WDS to rebroadcast the wireless signal.   In laymen's terms, it acts as a wireless repeater.

If shit hits the fan and this actually happens don't rely on technology to save you. You'll need a zero/low-technology solution. At least something that does not rely on anything WITH a transmitter or detectable signal. Cause that just attracts the vans.

Dubious then, yes. Doable now, absolutely. If you don't believe me look at an exemplar of [governmental gadget-porn](http://wikileaks.org/spyfiles/docs/stratign/278_strategic-defence-technologies.html) .

Edit: Moving the following up from a reply:

The most **practical** plan I can think of for such a scenario is a **public education campaign**. Simple things that people can implement without holding a PhD in EE, physics, CS, etc. Things like ""What is a one-time pad and how do I make/use one?"" ""What is triangulation and how is it used?"" ""What is cryptography and why isn't it unbreakable?"" ""What is a web of trust and what can break it?"" ""What is man-in-the-middle and how can I avoid him?"" ""What is impersonation?"" ""What does steganography mean?"" and so on.

SIMPLE things that a **large number of people should be able to understand**. Because if 1% of the ""99%"" uses some fancy technology to keep their communications covert, they are fucked, because the remaining 98.1% will not and **without them they are fucked**.

A start? A simple, straitforward, clean web page/portal that has information that can be used by an average person. Just an **introduction to** the concept of **discreet communication**. **In a culture that thinks that ""Facebook"" offers any level of privacy, yes, this is necessary.**

Please also see the [original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/14kxaw/if_internet_access_as_we_know_it_ended_tomorrow/c7ed5w3).

This is going to be a knock down argument against the meshnet plan, so pay attention.

ARGUMENT THE FIRST

One of the principle arguments for the meshnet (and against simply making a darknet over the Internet) is that we don't control the Internet, and those that do can ""turn off the Internet"" or censor it, or whatever.  

However, the meshnet idea is vulnerable to the very same things.  First, wireless routers may be compromised by governments and intelligence services.  So there goes half your meshnet, whenever they want.  Second, governments can control the wireless spectrum.  If they choose to shut it down, they can.  

So, why not do wired?  Because if anybody had the cash for wired, they'd be an ISP right now making coin.  Or what if we can defend our wireless connections?  Then you'd be a government.  

ARGUMENT THE SECOND

This project is for white geeks living in cities in North America and maybe Europe.  It's biggest proponents admit intercity communication is a problem with no apparent solution.  The meshnet will never grow in Asia or in countries already experiencing significant pressure by governments over wireless frequencies.  

If you think otherwise, please explain how the average Chinese or Indian is going to find the cash to buy a wireless router, when they don't even have computers?  Please also explain how the average Syrian, who can't afford a wifi router in the first place, will be able to setup a network while the government is waging a civil war.

It seems the /r/darknetplan need not apply to the largest countries in the world, and the most oppressed countries.

ARGUMENT THE THIRD

Darknet logic is so very clearly different from meshnet logic.  Darknet logic asks how we can make Internet traffic more secure, so secure perhaps that it is infeasible for any government or corporation to track and identify its users.  Meshnet logic is ""what can we do if the Internet shuts off?""

This is technology survivalism, not a sensible approach to building a darknet, notwithstanding the side bar in which the meshnet is viewed as a ""necessary foundation.""  

But more than that, the whole worry is absurd.  We should not worry that the Internet is going to shut off, leaving us stranded in the digital parking lot.  No, we should worry about more and more Internet.  More piled on top of more, until the very pores of our skin sing in TCP/IP.  That is the direction the real world is going.

If you're concerned about oppressed countries like Syria, then please see the second argument.  Meshnet in Syria?  Not likely.

SUMMARY

1. Meshnet is not secure against attacks by hostile governments.

2. Meshnet will not scale globally, will not escape the cities, will not penetrate impoverished and oppressed places.

3. Meshnet survivalism ignores the fact that we're 99% more likely to experience more Internet, not less.

I'm just going to leave it at that.  I can't imagine I need to say more.

TO THE OP'S QUESTION

If the Internet shut off, the best method of communication would be through real world networks, not digital ones.  Why?  Because if the Internet was shut off, we can assume the government has also shut down, or is closely observing all electronic communications.  And so I offer the following solutions.

SOLUTION ONE: COURIERS
If you need to transmit a *large* amount of data, the only way is by courier.  You copy the data to a harddrive, and walk the thing over.  End of story.

SOLUTION TWO: SECRET MEETINGS
If you need to coordination action during a time of crisis, hold secret meetings, share USB thumb drives, and harddrives.  Repeat this to circulate materials in time across a city, region, nation.  

But, hey, let's say this Internet outage is not due to a hostile government.  Then...

SOLUTION THREE: USE EVERY OTHER FORM OF COMMUNICATION AVAILABLE

Radio, Ham radio, television, cell phones, writing letters, using drones as carrier pigeons, Morse code, smoke signals?  Wait a week and the Internet will be back.

So the real solution to the problem is not more Internet --OR *ANOTHER* INTERNET!  It is maintaining a social network that can securely transmit messages through alternate systems of communication.  

Meshnet is a joke and a waste of time.

Edit: I can't help myself.

**The reason we all should be pissed off** /r/darknetplan has been taken over by true believers in the CJDNS and the mesh net, is that while the mesh net serves those few people capable and interested enough to run a CJDNS node (i.e., pasty white males in Seattle and Detroit), darknet software serves the billions currently connected to the Internet.  Whereas the meshnet will solve all our problems when t=infinity, darknet solutions are solving our problems today.

But instead of spending time thinking about the darknet, /r/darknetplan is full of pointless meshnet bullshit that will accomplish nothing.

**The alpha and omega of mesh nets.**  Free wireless networks in big cities are a well established culture.  Meshnet must have come out of some geek's observation that city wide wireless coverage could be turned into city-wide meshnets.  So far so good.  

But how many cities actually boast city-wide coverage?  No, most coverage is sparse at best.  And how many of these generous souls will want to shift to a meshnet, or will be capable of it?  50%?  Probably more like 5%.  There goes your city-wide coverage.  You're looking at 20 people in a city of millions.  

So now you have your Meshnet, using a mix of Ham radio, lasers, walkie-talkie's and so forth.  Who's going to use it?  Are these 20 geeks going to use it to play an awesome game of Quake [3] Arena?  No, they're going to totally overthrow this oppressive government, that's what!  They're going to throw it open to the revolution!

Meshnet opens up to the masses.  Meshnet admins sit at their consoles eating Cheetos awaiting the great deluge.  Oh, wait... who knows about this?  No body.  Ohhh.  So they'll find out on our home page called ""when the Internet goes down,"" right?  No.  The Internet is down, so you can't find it.  (We'll forget for the moment how the intellience services have already tracked down an eliminated the Meshnet based on their clearnet web page boasting about how awesome they are.)  So how do people find it?  They don't.

Okay forget about that.  Somehow everybody learns where to go to get on the Meshnet.  Now everybody is there.  People are ... doing what?  Not sending emails, not updating their Twitter and Facebook.  Since there's almost no bandwidth for the 5 million users that suddenly showed up, there's no video sharing, no audio sharing.  Only text.  Okay fine, why not text during this revolutionary moment?  This is a revolution of ideas!

So Meshnet is a bulletin board and private message system for the revolution.  Great.  Could it make a difference?  As soon as it starts making a difference, intelligence services have their *whole entire* afternoon tied up raiding 20 nodes.

I have been dark for the past month or so online but have been cramming away with the DuskNet project. I wanted to give everyone an update and a little teaser about the DuskNet project and what it has become. 


My first post about it can be seen below:

http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/voecq/making_a_cellular_dark_net_in_a_box_unit/


Well a bunch has changed since then, including i2p being used for interconnecting comms (took a little bit of hacking to get it to work as I wanted it too); but don’t worry CJDNS guys, I have one that works with that as well.

There is still cellular/Wi-Fi in the project as well as TV white space backhauling ( I was working with one company but they bailed, and now a new company has jump on for the TV white space RF interfaces).

 I will not go into too much detail because I hope to be releasing it at a talk during ToorCon 14; must pray to the CFP selection gods. 

I was going to be bringing the rough alpha unit and showing it at DefCon 20 this year, but as some of you know I had to drive back for work the last day of Black Hat. Sorry for any one whom I missed at DefCon. 

A major change to the project is that DuskNet is no longer a single unit but a solution to provide a rapid deployable darknet that allows people to BYOD and start utilizing the system, in simple “Communication for All”. 

Here is a sneak peak of the first working DuskNet Comms box, which is one of the bigger parts of the system. 

http://imgur.com/7vyte

Well I hope you all like this and hopefully, CFP selection gods willing, I will be giving a talk on this and the importance of such technology like this. Let me know what you think or if you have any questions. Again I will be releasing everything at a later time but I will still answer some questions.  


Side note: there are many differences from the DuskNet project and others (freedom box, piratebox, etc), but I will get more into that when I finally release this project during the weekend of ToorCon.

The emergence of P2P social media sites on today's internet framework would be a great start on Meshnet infrastructure until the physical layers can catch up.  

Of course, there are already projects like [Yacy](http://yacy.net/en/) and [Diaspora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora_%28software%29)  but for message passing, something like the old fashioned [Fidonet ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidonet) would add robust P2P based message passing including forums, and email.

First time post on this sub-reddit and look forward to becoming more involved.

I came up with an idea just a few days ago and have been trying to work on it in my free time (whenever that is). My idea is building a mobile “dark net base station” that has a multitude of wireless technologies within it that utilized open source encryption algorithms and authentication methods.
The idea is to have a base station that can mesh with other smaller or larger base stations. 

A quick background on me to see where I am coming from with my building of this device. I would like to think that I am not one of those guys that just come up with ideas that I can never build. I am a communications/security engineer with a focus with radio communications; so building a mobile base station is no big problem (An engineer’s famous last words). 
Being most familiar with commercial cellular networks, I am starting with an open GSM stack (OpenBTS) and WiFi. The network will utilize dark net designed, such as friend to friend and hidden services. Individuals will be able to expand this cellular network by connecting a system to a mesh wireless network or Ethernet (more as a back bone) and on the same system having a small USB SDR environment or a full USRP setup. Of course a huge amount of changes will have to be made to OpenBTS (some that I have started to work on)
The basic hardware and software needed can be seen in the image below. 

http://imgur.com/8UyIJ

This is setup could be used in a case like Egypt where the government tried to shut down the internet and other communications as a portable deployable dark net; where people can use their computers and cellular phones. 
I plan on having a PoC unit up and going at DefCon 20 (if I can get my E-STA from the FCC before then). 
I have called this project the Dusk Net (since you can see spectrum use with any basic energy detention spectrum analyzer) since it can never be a totally hidden network but also not available to everyone; it is the twilight in-between the two. 

I know this was a quick and dirty intro for something that I could spend a huge amount of time talking about this, but find it better to shut up and just build our ideas. 

I just want to know what you guys thinks, what I should add to this and how could I improve it.

One last thing: I understand that this would require using bands that one has to pay to use by the FCC and other organizations if you are outside the US. With that said in a scenario like Egypt, I don’t think people will really care about spectrum use regulations. 

Notes from IRC:

(1) I have not picked an official area to be at a DefCon 20 (Thoughts)

(2) If you guys have any gear that you would like to have integrated, bring it to DefCon and lets start hacking

(3) Dan68 is helpful when it comes to tried and true WiFi hardware 

(4) Looking at the CJDNS project (may not be able to integrate before DefCon... No time)

A Raspberry Pi device [weighs 45g](http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs), a usb wifi dongle [weighs 41g](http://www.ebay.com/itm/300Mbps-Hi-Speed-USB-Wireless-Adapters-Dongle-WiFi-802-11-N-B-G-LAN-Network-Card-/190641123661?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2c6318b14d#ht_7450wt_1398). Total, that is 86g of payload. It's unclear if the weight of the RPi includes the AA batteries.

Again according to HowStuffWorks, a typical balloon like you'd use at a birthday party contains approximately 14 liters. That means it takes ceil(86/14), or 7 regular balloons, to lift a simple RPi hub. Simply attach a bundle of 10 or so balloons (for redundancy) to the hub, and attach that to a 100+ foot long rope, and anchor the other end to the ground. Congratulations, you have an easy long-range omnidirectional antenna!

Total cost:

* $50 [Helium tank](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Balloon-Time-Helium-Tank-Fills-50-Balloons/14101103), good for 50 balloons
* $35 RPi model B (when model A comes out, that works too, and costs $10 less)
* $10 dongle
* $10 100 ft rope
* $1 Balloons from dollar store
* $1 Balloon string from dollar store

= $107 total.

Of course, this doesn't factor in having some ingredients on-hand already. This is probably the single easiest public wifi setup you can do. For best wind resistance, use multiple tether lines anchored as far away from each other as possible, though it's important to remember that without a solid tower, the wind *will* play with your toys, and this setup will not be suited for windy climates. Also, for simplicity's sake, use a basket of some kind to carry your hardware, instead of tying things directly on to it, which will become unmanageable with more than one tether.

To get an idea how far your router can stray if it goes down or gets blown around, imagine a two-tether setup illustrated [by this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Venn0001.svg). The center of each circle represents an anchor point, each circle is the maximum length of that rope, and the red area (or, intersection) is the area where the balloon has free reign to get tossed around. Make sure there are no power lines in your red area, that gets bad fast.

Thoughts?

**EDIT TO SUMMARIZE RESPONSES SO FAR:**

* Use hydrogen, not helium. If your craft is hit by lightning, what's in the balloon(s) doesn't matter much, since the whole thing will basically explode anyways if the the current is not properly grounded and routed around the balloons.
* Rope weight. You have to compensate for rope weight, and that's a much bigger factor than your actual payload.
* You're often better served by using a single, canvas aerostat. Blimps have aerodynamics problems if they're stationary, aerostats have a different shape and are fine with it. Properly maintained, they can last for years.
* When the weather is bad, take it down. Balloon ""towers"" are not weather resistant, so don't play it tough, play it smart.
* Maintenance. It's easy to get one of these up in the air, but then you have to refill they hydrogen, patch holes, and replace batteries. If you do wireless this way, you're going to have to accept those as the terms of the deal.",,False,self,t5_2rju2,True,,,True,t3_q4l3e,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/q4l3e/tethered_balloon_stations/,

1321841608.0,89,self.darknetplan,mjn12,"Everyone - this is the big picture. Please read and discuss. It isn't as simple as ""make wireless meshes"".",109,20,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/mjn12/everyone_this_is_the_big_picture_please_read_and/,"Let me begin by saying that I am a network engineer by profession. I deal with public peering and transit on a daily basis. As I see continued discussion on both Reddit and IRC, there seem to be a few key requirements for this project that people are either overlooking, or need to be further addressed:

1. DarkNET, or whatever we decide to call this project, NEEDS to be connected to the public internet:

Before I get into technical details, lets take a quick step back and identify what the main goal of this project is. From my understanding, the end-goal would be to have created a large, geographically distributed network that allows end-users (us) to communicate without reliance on corporations. 

The thing is, if we aren't connected to the public internet, we are completely disconnected from one another (except locally) and all content on the internet. Additionally, if we are are unable to access any content on the internet from this network, we will not receive enough support and participation on this project. The incentive isn't going to be there. This is a massive project and is going to require a lot of professional participation, organization, leadership, and time, and you aren't going to get tens of thousands of people working on a network that doesn't have any content on it at all.  What is the point of connecting with someone, or chatting with someone, over this alternative network if the internet still works fine? It's just not going to happen.  Alternatively, if we gain support and our network is created to the internet, then why NOT use it? It won't be as fast as your connection with Comcast, but it will be free, at least.

The point that I'm really illustrating here is the necessity for some sort of backbone. A network backbone, by definition, is an ""infrastructure that interconnects various pieces of network, providing a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks"". The backbone will connect the local wireless meshes to one-another, and also provide a high speed path to the public internet. Accomplishing this project with wireless meshes alone is not feasible. Wireless technology has gotten good, but it will simply not accomplish what we want. 

2. So now we need a backbone? How would that work?
Essentially, we need a presence in multiple internet exchanges. An internet exchange is a physical location where multiple providers have equipment that connects between one-another. If DarkNET has its own equipment in an internet exchange, we are then peering to existing networks, thus becoming a piece of the internet backbone. Now - before everyone says, ""Wait, I thought the whole point of this project was to DISCONNECT ourselves from the internet?"", understand that having a path doesn't make us reliant on the internet, are have to abide by the same rules that corporations do (or possibly could if SOPA and similar bills pass). This is merely a ""fat pipe"" that would connect us to the internet. Additionally, using the internet backbone will allow our local wireless meshes to connect to each other. 

There really is no other option when this project is in its infancy. That being said, over time if this project did gain a lot of support and funding, we could purchase our own ""transit links"", and have dedicated connections between our backbone devices. This would remove any remaining reliance from the internet (since we could traverse our own transit links as opposed to the networks we are peering with). 

A lot of people on the subreddit seem to think that using any cabling, even for the backbone,  for some reason means that we can be owned or controlled, but it doesn't at all - reliance on corporations does.

3. This all sounds kinda expensive!
Yeah. It is. Well, it doesn't HAVE to be, but as we grow, our equipment will need to also.  Honestly, one of the most expensive parts of this whole thing is the wireless. We some how have to connect our local wireless meshes to our backbone. This would mean that those who are geographically nearby to the DarkNET points of presence will need to also connect to the points of presence via wifi, thus providing a path from the local mesh to the backbone. Wireless shit isn't cheap. 

In the beginning, before everyone runs off to cancel their contracts with their ISP's, we are still going to rely on our existing internet connections. Some users with need to connect to the backbone via VPN. I can go into detail on that also, but it's another lengthy topic, so for now just know that we will connect our local meshes to our backbone using our existing internet service providers as a pathway. We won't have to abide by their rules or regulations, and our traffic would all be encrypted, but we still need them when we start out.

4. So how do we actually get started on this project?
Unfortunately, picking a name and logo is not the most difficult part of what we're trying to do here. I'm not knocking on those of you who have been making designs, etc, but rather, trying to highlight the fact that we need a huge amount of resources and participation to make this work.  It isn't just network engineers and developers, we will need tons of roles to be filled. I mean, people coordinating upgrade projects, teams assigned to geographic locations, massive amounts of documentation… everything that an ISP would need, essentially.

Speaking of which, understand that! Understand that this is nothing more than creating our own internet provider that we have full control of and use ourselves. We would have our own points of presence, our own backbone, our own connections to the home via wireless, everything. It's actually really awesome.

Maybe clusters of b/g on different channels linked together by 5ghz n as a sort of backbone? And knowing more about routing than my limited ""BGP exists"". 

My guess is that your limit would be density---you can only have so many people on the same frequencies in the same place. Latency might be a problem due to the number of hops? Or would it be throughput? Maybe you can compensate by having some of your 5ghz nodes with very directional antennas so you can pack them closer?

It wouldn't need to have Internet access, you could set up asterisk and people could have phone service. Wikipedia, etc. resources could be packed in. Local forums and media sharing... still pretty useful.

I've been thinking about how we should proceed with this subreddit and the plan in general. 

The first thing I have to say is about my own role in the subreddit. I am no technical expert and have no guiding vision for this plan. As a moderator, I see my role as simply ensuring that spam is dealt with and that the subreddit grows. There are many people on here that have MUCH more technical experience than me.

Next, we need to talk about growing the subreddit. We need to get the word out about this subreddit and reach a reasonable number of people so that people can start coordinating in more localized regions. We have almost 2000 members now, but it still is too small. If you have any ideas on how to do this, let me know.

The next step is making everything accessible. This is a job for those tech geniuses on the subreddit. Improving the wiki so that even tech impaired people can understand at least the basics will help our cause greatly.

Then we have the actual plan. We have a million ideas thrown out there right now, all with their positives and negatives. We need to get all these plans down to one plan that, as said above, will be accessible to an almost average person so that we actually have a chance of getting things done. This means we need to stop squabbling about the ideas and come to a decision as a subreddit some time very soon.

How can we accomplish all this?

From now on, I'm going to ask dedicated members of this subreddit to volunteer to help a group of people tackle certain tasks. If you would like to help with one of the below tasks, comment below and say why.

Community Organizers: These people will be dedicated to organizing both local and online events to bring attention to our cause and to help carry out the plan as determined by the more technical members of our group. This is a larger task than it seems, so if you want to help and take it seriously I could really use you. Let me know.

Tech Gurus: This is possibly the biggest thing we need right now. If you have experience with networking (please state your experience in your post) and have ideas on how we should proceed from a technical standpoint and have the time to actually do planning, please apply for this spot. Heres the big catch: This group NEEDS to come to a consensus for a plan (at least the technical aspect of it) that will be effective. Once you think you have a plan, present it to the community for input.

Map managers: We need a main person to create a map and a few people to moderate it. If someone with coding experience could use the google maps api to create a map in which a person can mark their general location and then have each person be contactable via email without displaying the email address itself. 

Darknet Leaders: These people will be responsible for making the community and technology aspects come together. Basically if you're applying for this position you need networking AND leadership experience in order for things to go smoothly. The group leaders will be responsible for making sure everything runs smoothly.


So these are my ideas on getting things a little more organized. Input is encouraged, and I really hope we can start working together a little better on this important plan.

Two antennas, one for sending and one for receiving, so they don't interfere.  Sending and receiving happens simultaneously.  Each phone can be run as a repeater node if desired.

Repeater only nodes can be set up as well, imagine some guy with a 50 foot tower in his back yard handling tons of traffic.

Each phone operates on public/private key so info sent is encrypted until it reaches its destination.

Sending and receiving as a repeater can be done for a fee.  $X per packet or something and the info is sent through the most efficient repeaters.  I could see a network for phones popping up very quickly if people could turn a profit by acting as repeaters.

And if you want to get a positive balance in your phone so you can make some calls, all you had to do was leave it on as a repeater for a while, letting others pay you.

I would like to know more about the basics (emphasis on *basics*) of:

* Darknets/meshnets: How to access it and help others do the same

* Data encryption

* BitCoin — being able to send them, and enabling others to send them to me with an easy link or a QR code, the way it is with PayPal

* A reliable, **easy-to-learn** OS that's especially compatible with the above. Windows 8 seems to be bad for privacy, and even Ubuntu's been badmouthed by Stallman — any other notable ones? (Or is Stallman just being paranoid?)

After reading [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/1bo2or/unhosted_web_apps_16_our_plan_to_save_the_web/c98ol8z), I realized you guys might be interested, or have some ideas on how to make it better. I do apologize if this is too spammy, and mods should feel free to delete it.





The project is called Tavern, and there's some more information up at [Tavern.com](http://Tavern.com)







The basic structure is built around exchanging GPG-signed JSON strings. Your GPG key becomes your base identity, no matter where the message goes. The message itself can be passed by any means, similar to Usenet/UUCP - Each message is posted to a ""Topic"" which is similar to a subreddit - You choose which topics you want your node to subscribe to, and it'll start downloading them automatically.

Messages can be exchanged either node-&gt;node, or, if you're in a densely populated area, you can do machine-&gt;machine relay, and form an effective message-based meshnet, without needing a persistent end-to-end connection.

The message-based design also lets you relay messages on a phone or USB stick, physically carrying them out of a dangerous/restricted area and shared with the word.. A few days later you could walk back in with a new USB stick containing replies and other posts to those topics.

The system works - I have a UI, functioning webs of trust, and message ranking and voting built in, as well as choosing your own moderators - It works reasonably well so far, but I know there's a lot more to do.

As mentioned on the site, one other element I've been working on was porting it to the Raspberry pi. That took a bit of work, since MongoDB is limited there, so I had to post to Postgresql, but it lets me sell an easy to use plug-and-play version that my father could run at home easily.  For a network like this to work, I think it's critical to make it easy enough for anyone, even my Dad, to quickly and easily get it running.

I want to release it RSN, but there's a few things I want to do first - The first (and most expensive ;/  ) is to try to get a real security review. When I talk with people who need such a solution, many are in a situation where real harm can come to them if I have exploits, so I'd rather get it right...

1332649200.0,76,self.darknetplan,rcbfj,Will the community voice their opinion on whether this content is off topic for /r/darknetplan? A post was recently deleted and there is some moderation controversy about the decision to remove it.,99,23,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/rcbfj/will_the_community_voice_their_opinion_on_whether/,"I recently posted some original content to this community, which was removed for being off-topic. I'd like to hear if members of this community believe the content belongs in /r/darknetplan, or if I was, in fact, in error for posting it to this community.

I'll attempt to neutrally and briefly describe what I posted, and, with the advice of a moderator, ask you if this is appropriate content. What I posted is described by this:

1. A documentary exists that was uploaded to YouTube. Its content appears to be rare, hard to find, and highly sought after, as evidenced by blog posts urging interested partied to ""watch it while you can"".

2. The documentary was removed from YouTube due to copyright claims. It is hard to find elsewhere on the open internet.

3. I located the documentary on I2P, a decentralized network. Similar to CJDNS, its users are concerned with decentralized network management, though I2P is also built around anonymity and directly supports file sharing.

4. I thought that access to the documentary would encourage users to try I2P and learn more about decentralized networks, so I created and posted a how-to guide on /r/darknetplan. It contained instructions for using I2P and downloading the content. It also included information on why I feel the content is worth downloading, including a short synopsis.

My post on /r/darknetplan accrued 131/13 votes in an hour or two, with numerous comments and questions. The top comments related to I2P, the content, and anonymity. As of the time of this post, there were no comments saying it was off-topic or didn't belong.

The how-to guide was then removed by a moderator. In part, his claim is that: ""...You claim you are trying to spread awareness of I2P, yet I only see a post regarding some disney conspiracy. Try /r/conspiracy or /r/darknet. Your post is one of the most irrelevant 'censorship' posts I have come across..."" 

I've been in contact with another mod, who would like me to ask you about censorship and settle a question about what is considered off-topic here. I care about this community, and have formulated this post with guidance from the mod, so that we can address it without bias:

***Question:*** Are how-to guides for downloading pirated material using I2P the sort of content you would like to see on this subreddit? If not, what about the above would you like to see modified for it to be on-topic?

----

TL;DR: What do you consider to be on-topic for this subreddit? Do you want to discuss piracy and censorship, or should we stick to CJDNS management topics?

(If this TL;DR seems biased, please read the full post. It's hard to make an unbiased TLDR).

(*Edit:* I want to clarify that I'm refraining from voting on anything in this thread.)

*Edit 2:* I'd also like to point out that the content is rare to the point where it cannot be purchased anywhere. The copyright holder in question has gone so far as to require existing copies be destroyed.

*Edit 3:* It looks like there are questions that depend on the actual nature of what I posted. I won't directly post the link, but if you have such questions, please view my comment history and check for my cross-posts. I go into detail explaining everything about it.

*Edit 4:* I must sleep. It's been fun discussing this. I'm glad /r/darknetplan can have a reasoned, open discussion about its appropriate content. Even if I can't post the how-to guide in question, as seems likely, I think this thread will decide important, democratically determined guidelines that should be respected.

---

*Edit 5:* Having read the thread and responded where appropriate, the consensus of the community seems to be that the content, as described, was not appropriate for /r/darknetplan. I appreciate the chance to discuss the issue, and I definitely have a better idea of what sort of content I should post here in the future. Hopefully this thread gives the mods important information about what people want to see moderated, too.

Thanks to everyone being so civil. This is a community I value for its ability to rationally discuss a topic, even when moderation is involved.

The reason I am posting is that they are trying to clean up the GUI and need a graphic designer. If you are a graphic desiger, this seems like a really cool place to get involved.

Edit: Here is the wish list:

- Logo
- Icon of logo (16x16px)
- Color scheme
- Font choices
  - 4 navgation icons to go in a sidebar or across the top
  - Friends
  - Groups

About Masques

From the Masques website: http://findmasques.org

Enjoy social networking. Keep your privacy.

You want to share personal information with your friends, not the world. Why are you using a public website?

Masques is designed to provide an alternative to posting your personal information on a website with an always changing, yet always confusing, privacy policy.

Masques runs on your computer. All of your media stays on your computer, not some corporation's server. When you want to share, your files and messages are sent directly from your computer to your friend's computer, securely and privately. Masques uses I2P, or the ""invisible internet,"" to transfer your information directly to your friends without ever sending anything to a centralized server.

Best of all, the ""privacy policy"" is more than just a policy: your privacy is protected with math, not legal documents, which are often changed or simply violated. Because of the many layers of encryption and because we publish our source code for the world to see, you know you can trust Masques to protect privacy. Not even the Masques developers can invade the privacy of your social network.

With Masques, you can be sure your personal information, and entire social network, is safe from digital thieves, data mining companies, and intrusive government surveillance.

Technical Details

Masques is a distributed, encrypted, self updating social network.

Masques uses the I2P network to locate friends and share data without using a centralized server. Masques is programmed in Clojure and makes significant use of public/private key encryption.

Masque identities are a pair of public keys and a little meta-data, stored a clojure S-experessions. Identities can be stored or shared as either text files or scannable images (QR codes).

Masques is Open Source

No offence to anyone but ""In case the government shuts down the internet"" just isn't a compelling reason for a large majority of folks.

I think that we should really start trying to sell it as just ""a separate, free internet.""

Using already-established protocols (I happen to think that UUCP is ideal for this project while it's in its infancy) we could run newsgroup servers at the beginning.  UUCP has provisions for file transfers, email, and netnews already built in.

This network will likely not be high-performance enough to support gaming and streaming video for many many years, so we should focus on attainable goals in the short term and go forward from there.

Free email and file sharing?  I'd sign up for that in a jiffy.

Edit:  Note to retards, since this is apparently not clear:  I'm not advocating running a usenet mirror, as obviously the traffic would be too high.

On the structural side, can we please abandon the idea of one big global mesh already?  Local meshes are fine, but there has to be a high-bandwidth, low-latency backbone if transfers are going to happen in reasonable time frames.

First of all, I'd like to clear up a few things:

* We want to create a network, independent from ""the *real* internet"", without using ISPs. We will use our custom hardware and bundle a few software, with our own auto-config tool and interface.
* The final 'product' should be as user-friendly as possible. Meaning ""you click two buttons and everything is configured for you"".
* We have been talking about settling on a single hardware platform, so we don't have to deal with fragmentation. In the end, people will acquire our ""mesh nodes"" for about $50 (with a very, very thin margin of benefit, to pay for the expenses).
* Edge-cases are supposed to be solved by people who know what they are doing. Of course, a standard ""mesh node"" won't work in rural areas: that's why it'll have antenna inputs, so more advanced users can set up more advanced links. This is how inter-city and inter-region links should be handled. Our aim is to make the hardware work in an urban area.
* Regular routers won't suffice: we have more or less settled on the idea that we need at least two WiFi radios: one for mesh networking (OLSR, BATMAN, Babel, whatever) and one for roaming clients, in AP mode (smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc).

What we need **right now**:

* *Qualified network and software experts*. We want to have a rough draft of what we're trying to accomplish, and how we should do it. If you fit this description, please join IRC.
* *Graphic designers*. Seriously. The website is something I whipped up quickly to be a placeholder. A more 'professional-looking' website is very much needed. If you can help with this, please click on the webchat link [here](http://darknetplan.org/webchat), or on the sidebar.
* Money. We're starting to need it: I'm currently paying the server and domain bills, but as we grow, more resources will be needed. 

Random discussion about things:

* We have agreed on using ""meshnet"" as our project name, at least the ""PR"" name. It sounds great, in my opinion. We could ask the reddit admins to see if they can change our subreddit name, but I don't think that's possible. But we'd only do it if it's fine for you guys.
* derp has compiled a [website](http://outreach.x10.mx/docs.php) with valuable information about the meeting we had last Saturday. I'll put a link in the sidebar, it'll be there until we merge it with the main website. 
* Should we buy ""meshnet.com"" (or meshnet.net, or something along those lines)?

I think this is the reality on the ground that eventually Meshnet will face to be successful - From hackers to organized endeavors by powerful people with endless resources, it would face people with intention of shutting it down, some with paid day jobs. Its simply not enough to get it going. Surly Gov agents would not just want to shut it down, but probably want the Names of the 'Terrorists' behind it - Do you really think even US security wouldn't want that data these days?

The network built must withstand their attacks and I thought it might be helpful if we probe its theoretical weaknesses to assist the building of its foundation.

So what would you do?

P.S

I think there are lessons to be learned by looking at countries who have their phone/internet shut off during protests &amp; heavily censored, today. Contrary to popular belief, Many Iranians have broadband and Wireless Routers in the capital. If a system can be built to accommodate their problems, it would surly satisfy its purpose in the US!

Thanks for your warm reception to [my previous article](http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/mr7pq/youre_going_about_this_all_wrong/). As promised, here's a Manifesto about the Darknet development effort, and a consequent Plan.


**Goals - from the highest level down.**

From a bird's-eye view, it seems that we are trying to create a new way to interchange data that's less subject to external control, monitoring and interference than the Internet is today - a network that is out of control.

And what's needed to hit such a lofty goal?

**Users**

Above and beyond all else, we need users at all levels - from developers to experimenters to end-users who have no understanding of the technology.  If we make a great system and no one comes, we lose.  If we make something that's merely useful, and everyone uses it, we win.

Right now, the Darknet as it's proposed, and I'm sorry if this is a bit harsh, gives the impression of only being interesting to people who are deeply suspicious of the governments of the world.

Now, I think government is one of humanity's greatest inventions, and I personally want bigger, more responsible and more competent government - BUT I think anyone who reads newspapers and history books should have every reason to be aware of the fact that governments in the past and present have at times been extremely destructive to their own citizens and that being suspicious of them is quite rational.

Nevertheless, this is a tough sell to your average person, who believes that it's fairly unlikely that e.g. the US will really become like Soviet Russia.

We can't lose focus on the underlying idea of an out-of-control network!  But we also have to realize that in order to get the huge adoption that we need for a Big Win, that the network _has to offer something to more people than just anarchists_ (and I say this as someone who has a great deal of sympathy for the political theory that has the somewhat inaccurate name of anarchy).

We need that huge adoption, but we particularly need it in developers - because we otherwise won't deliver product.  Right now, the development end is very technical, and can only use a small subset of possible contributors.  In order to attract more developers, we need to make it _accessible_ to a wide range of developers, we need to make it _fun_, FFS!, and ideally if we could make it _educational_ we could get a lot of resources from the educational systems of the world.

And to attract both developers and end-users, we need to be _agnostic_ - platform agnostic, hardware agnostic, network agnostic, as I wrote in my previous article.  It's not just that it makes the system more accessible to all, but that it makes it _simpler._  The work hasn't vanished, of course, it's moved into the specific implementations of parts, but it makes it much easier for experts on a platform, a piece of hardware, or a technology like authentication or network discovery, to work just on their part as a separate module.

Finally, it needs to be _scalable_.  This doesn't mean we need to know how to solve the problem of scaling to millions of users before we start - it does mean that we have to relentlessly eliminate singletons, single points where everything passes through, or any operation that runs on an individual machine with time complexity of greater than O(log(N)), where N is the number of nodes in the network.

**Non-goals?**

Lots of lofty goals, what are some non-goals?

A classic engineering motto says:  ""[Good, cheap, fast:  pick two.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_triangle)"" - so what are we not going to get?

Let's start with ""efficiency"" - in compacting messages, usage of bandwidth, usage of CPU.  We're looking for a protocol that's educational, entertaining, out-of-control - and our basic idea is that we're passing around fairly small items with high intrinsic value.

So efficiency is a non-goal.  Of course, the code has to _work,_ and if it's too slow no one will use it, but we don't have to write everything in optimized C++ (not that I don't love C++ but it's a lot of work!) and we don't have to make our protocol super-compressed (and for any real compression, we'd simply rely on external tools like zip, gzip, bz2, .ogg, .flac etc...)

What about reliability?  Yes, reliability is also a ""non-goal"" in many ways!  Wait, you say, who wants buggy software?  Well, the underlying system of course has to work well, but if you look at many of the transport mechanisms already proposed, they all come with a greater and lesser degree of reliability already.  And we also need to make the system span to even nodes that are not fully reliable.

We need to embrace and control unreliability, and measure it and make decisions based on it, but we cannot cast it out.

And what about user interface?  Well, of course we'll need interfaces, which we'll write, but I think _specifying_ a user interface should also be a non-goal of the core project.  Everything we in the core group create for GUI should be merely thought of as a placeholder for the real interface - because people love writing user-interface code :-D and we might as well take advantage of that.


**A development plan, in five parts.**

**1. Services.**

So far, everything, including my articles, has either been on an abstract level or been specific on bottom-up details of the technology.

But let's get back to your average guy, your average developer.   ""What's in it for me?""

We need to define a set of fairly specific _services_ that this system will be offering.  We need to tell people what they should expect to get if they and their friends set up some Darknet node.

When I say we, I mean the whole community.  Some parts of programming design are best not done by a committee, but if we don't get buy-in from the community on what services will be provided, they won't adopt the system when it's done.

Ideas for specific services could be expressed as [user stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) - short, precise but non-technical descriptions of what you get.


The deliverable here is a general agreement on a prioritized list of user stories describing what services we hope to get.


**2. Structures.**

At this point, a small number of engineers need to go off and define the data and network _structures_ that the project will use - the representations of packets, of addresses, of specific requests for things like ""discovery"".

This is a key stage.  We need to keep this as light, flexible and extensible as possible so we don't find ourselves in a corner in six months;  but we also have to fairly complete or we can't move forward.

We still haven't written any code or put together any hardware - these are abstract data structures that we'll implement in one or more languages later.


The deliverable here is a document or set of documents specifically describing down to the individual fields the programming data structures and network protocols we're planning to use.  Of course, this will change somewhat in the next steps, but we should try to hit the target here as closely as we can, because the costs of later changes in this spot might be great.


**3. Sample.**

Now we need to go away and write a bunch of code - hopefully not so much code if we've been careful in steps 1 and 2.

Tnese will have actual implementations of the data structures first - and then implementations of the services, hardware drivers and that sort of thing in hopefully short order.

I'm going to strongly suggest Python for this task, as a powerful and modern language that's free and open-source, has wide adoption, is easy for beginners to pick up, and is one that I personally know well.  :-D


Deliverable:  a toy system that has all the parts we designed in part 2, and some tests and/or demos for the parts.


**4. Standard.**

We have some excitement, now we need to move as quickly as possible to some milestone that will allow other developers to go away and do their own work independently in their own fields (and in their own code repositories).

To do that, we need to release a reference _standard_ version of the system- one that has many (but not necessarily all) of the services we specified in step 1 _completely_ implemented.

This would require some sort of hardware.  For this release (and for time to come!) this has to be completely off-the-shelf stuff - for example, a list of wireless devices known to work with the softare.

And there need to be software implementations of the services.

Now, these don't have to be slick implementations, fast implementations or anything like that - but they need to be complete and clear with good code.

At this point, a developer can just download the Standard code, compile and run a Standard Node, and then immediately start coding extensions to it by plugging in more hardware or editing specific files we point them to.  This is how almost everyone develops, starts with a working system and then modifies it, and we should make this as easy as possible.


**5. System.**

Note that we still don't have a user interface!  But that's step 5, where we release a _system_ that end users can run.  This means creating user interfaces (or perhaps external developers will have already done this!), and packaging up builds into a single file for distribution.

There's a reasonable quantity of drudgery here, but this is a known quantity, and if we've made it to here, we probably have a lot of help.  The really hard part is getting to step 4...

So who's running this show, and what can I do to help? 

My credentials; sr. level network monkey, sr. level unix/linux admin, amateur extra extra ham radio operator. I like communications almost as much as I despise censorship. 

**Edit:** I'm not getting much in the way of ""how this could actually work"" so I'll add a starting point...


Lets start with a high level design, no real technical specs but just a quick writeup on how we'd like things to look.

In my mind, I'd imagine several ""roles"", this is fairly similar to how the *real* Internet works, no reason that it shouldn't look similar.

 * Starting at the client, we'll call this a ""client role"". This role uses low spec devices, doesn't much routing resources, and it's main jobs are to merely get to the next role device and to extend the mesh.

 * The next role up the chain would be an ""access role"". The client devices should start to aggregate here, maybe we can call this a ""pod"", or a small network of devices. This device would be a higher spec than the client role, and potentially would have some mechanism to extend the mesh range (think repeater).

 * The access roles would then feed up to an ""edge role"". This is where many of the local ""pods"" all interconnect and should be the device that handles routing to the rest of the world. This device shouldn't necessarily be responsible for extending the mesh, but should be decently spec'd to be able to hold routing information. 

 * The edge devices should then connect to some ""core role"" devices that are responsible for shortening paths, adding redundancy, and essentially being the backbone of this mesh. Each edge role should connect to several cores.

 * Maybe we can add some sort of ""aggregation role"" (think IXP), similar to cores but these would connect large networks to other large networks. 

Great, now we have a start... so, what do we do now? I think it's fairly obvious that ipv4 isn't the right tool for the job. Everyone is using the same rfc1918 space, small devices cannot hold large routing tables, consumer grade electronics doing consumer grade things, etc.  Sounds like a great opportunity to help push for ipv6. 


Okay, I've added some stuff.

Looking around the subreddit, I see there is some confusion regarding cjdns, why/how it's important, and how to get it up and running. I'd like to address some of those issues here today with a brief rundown of what cjdns does (in as close to layman terms as possible), why it's important to get nodes up and running (and how), and how it can potentially be applied to a physical mesh network.

**Why is cjdns important to Project Meshnet?**

As we all know the goal of Project Meshnet is to create a nation/worldwide network seperate from the internet we know today to combat censorship and centralized network control. To acheive this, we must create a network with no central power, as power corrupts. Problem is, we don't have the hardware to just put that kind of infrastructure into place, so we have to start somewhere.

This is where cjdns comes in. It allows us to create a virtual network inside of our existing network. The cool thing about it is, we can use this virtual network to connect to other ""nodes"" on the cjdns network that people who aren't connected to cjdns cannot see. This gives us a foundation to build the meshnet upon in a (albeit virtual) real-world manner. With this foundation in place, we can connect other devices to cjdns nodes to expand the meshnet from our virtual network into physical networks.

*Advantages:*

cjdns uses the new version of internet protocal (IP) addressing, which is inherenty more secure than the current version used on the internet today.

Only cjdns nodes can connect to the sites and services available on the meshnet.

*Disadvantages:*

Only available on Linux and BSD (currently).

**Why is it important to get more cjdns nodes up and running?**

It is important to create more nodes so others can connect and expand the mesh. The biggest advantage to a mesh network is having nodes connected at multiple points for alternate routing. In a mesh network, you can have 1 or 2 nodes go down and be fine. But if you have multiple nodes that connect across a single node to another segment of the network, and that node goes down, you've cut of an entire block of the network. More nodes means more redundancy.

That's not the only reason more nodes are important though. Another major point is the ability to start bridging to local hardware. Once you have 1 node on a local network (let's say a home network featuring a wireless router) you could set up other devices on your local net to connect to your existing node without the need to connect to the internet. Furthermore, once the cjdns becomes more defined, on could theoretically bridge cjdns to a local network that uses IPv6, and have IPv6 capable hardware connect to the mesh without need for additional hardware (I will cover this in more detail in a minute).

*Getting on cjdns*

For those interested in getting a cjdns node up and running, you'll probably want to install a version of linux in a Virtual Machine. [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/products/player/overview.html) is available free of charge. If you need help setting up a VM, [look here](https://gist.github.com/1677899#file_vmware.md). Debian or Ubuntu are recommended for those new to linux.

[The github site for cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) contains step-by-step instructions for getting cjdns ready and connected. A more user-friendly guide can be found [here](http://projectmeshnet.org/threads/archlinux-pkgbuild-and-init-script-for-cjdns.12/) (Thanks Method320 for the link).

**The Meshnet Project can and WILL benefit from cjdns in the future**

This project can benefit so much from cjdns on many levels. Currently, it provides us with a real-world network through existing networks to test and expand upon. But, unless we continue to use it and help in its development, it will bear little fruit.

If we can expand cjdns into MS Windows and Mac OSX, we will be able to support most forms of user PC available, making the Meshnet more accessable to end users. Furthermore, cjdns desperately needs a port to ARM based devices. With the abundance of Android smartphones on the market, having a revision of cjdns for ARM would allow for huge leaps in our efforts.

Additionally, the capability of bridging hardware adapters to the cjdns network would be most ideal, as that would allow for connections to the Meshnet without additional software. IPv6 enabled hotspots could go straight into the Meshnet. We could have pirate-box like devices hosting direct connections in public space. The possibilities of what CAN be done are massively increased of this kind of capability becomes available.

**In conclusion,** cjdns is a *huge* asset to the Meshnet Project with many possible applications. If we want to expand the network, though, we need to be willing to learn new things and think in new ways to make it happen. Yes, it's been tough getting things going up to this point, but cjdns has provided what could be the biggest setting stone in the Meshnet. 

**TL;DR: There is no tl;dr. If you want to know more about cjdns and what it is/how it helps, read the post and do more research if that's not a good enough answer. This is a group effort, and it requires a bit of learning. I hope some people get something out of this post. Thank you for your time**

This seems to be mostly from folks who are not hams in the first place and don't know or understand the restrictions that us ham radio ops have to live with. I'm not going to go into the entire FCC Chapter 47 Part 97 rules us American hams use as there are only a few key items relevant to MeshNet. You can find the FCC Part 97 rules in its entirety [here](http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_10/47cfr97_10.html) and alternatively at the [ARRL](http://www.arrl.org/part-97-amateur-radio) for additional reading.

As stated in [Part 97 subsection 113](http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2010/octqtr/47cfr97.113.htm) we're prohibited from relaying traffic from non-ham stations and engaging in regular communications that are better suited for other radio services. The former is self explanatory, but the later for us could be interpreted as the internet over part 15 wireless networks. Its a stretch, but it is possible to use that as a reason against the project by the FCC. Either way, unless its a life or death emergency we're not allowed to relay traffic from unlicensed users which is the big killer for ham radio in the MeshNet.

Now in the case we're not connecting wirelessly to ham control mesh nodes without a license and instead are connected by VPN to a computer linked to the mesh node we're still subject to [Part 97 subsection 219](http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2010/octqtr/47cfr97.219.htm) which governs message forwarding. This states that we have to be able to identify the origins of the traffic to ensure its legal on the ham bands (ie Ham traffic) and if we cannot id the traffic that we must accept responsibility for it. This means if there's traffic from unlicensed users we're responsible to block said traffic otherwise we risk losing our license.

Twitter and Facebook, user friendly applications, have proved to be instrumental in communicating across the world in regions with civil unrest. Sure, some of us can slap together proprietary packet-radio systems and nerd-out sending data across huge distances.

In a region where internet has been deactivated (and inaccessible) I'm thinking about Mr. Johnny Everyman who still has valuable information to send. An ""average consumer,"" he has his Laptop and Canon DSLR, takes pictures and video of military coups or uprisings, evidence of war-crimes or deplorable conditions, but can't get it ""out there.""

Most people (ok... maybe I'm being a little generous) have a good grasp on how to connect to a WiFi network. Everyman see's the WiFi SSID: ""CONNECT HERE TO COMMUNICATE,"" and when he does, goes to access HTTP and is redirected to the hotspot's portal.

The Portal, to the average user, shows

 - Nicknames connected

 - Chat Dialog

 - Network-Op driven Headlines / Newsfeed

 - Upload File(s)

 - Receive File(s)

###I've developed a mockup here: http://i.imgur.com/hPPAu.png


The network operator, who obviously has better capability to communicate than Everyman, may or may not participate in disseminating the information. Hopefully the NetOps are ethical.

The Portal, to the network operator, shows (definitely not limited to):

 - MAC Address (I know these aren't static) and computer name

 - Windows Shares

 - Browser Information / Session Data grabs (if possible)

 - Signal dB Meter

 - Other methods of inconspicuously profiling individuals connected

I know even $30 WiFi routers can be deployed with customized software. Does such a conceptualization already exist that I'm ignorant of? Would anybody be interested in this sort of system?

Combine the software of Tor, Mesh, and Bitcoin to create an alternate currency.  Except unlike Bitcoin value is assigned to packets shared and not to puzzles solved.  Cryptographic digestion of the continuing ledger is contained within the program, in other words your computer checks the whole ledger, not unlike Bitcoin miners. But unlike Bitcoin the end user has to pay for the packets.  How ‘money’ would flow into the system is through the mined value of sharing. Money would flow out out through consumption of data- end users pay the ledger- their money is destroyed. However this money in money out would be similar to Bitcoin in the fact that it would eventually balance.  A balance that is never even, it should always be marginally more profitable to share, then to consume, this upper limit coin generation slope should be set by the 'moore’s law' slope for bandwidth as to provide coinage for new content consumption.  A cryptographic tax free coinage based on bandwidth and shared packets would be just the ticket to a free internet- provided your Karma is positive. This works nicely in a mesh sense as the value is in connecting people to your internet securely to the content that they wish to see.

Instead of sending packets a, b and c separately from a router to a computer, the software instead sends packets a, b and c together in a group, along with an algebraic equation like a + b = c. This way, if any one of those three packets doesn't make it, the computer doesn't have to ask for a replacement: it can just solve for whichever packet is missing. For a computer, this sort of math is a cinch, so it can be done quickly and efficiently.

The upshot of transmitting packets in this way is that you don't have to worry about packet loss anymore. This won't boost your speeds if you're sitting right next to your router, but it has the potential to make things massively better if you're not. In fact, the worse your connection is, the better this method works: in a typical outdoor environment at MIT, using the algebraic packet method boosted wireless speeds from one Mbps to 16 Mbps. On a train, the improvement was even more pronounced, going from 0.5 Mbps to 13.5 Mbps, which is about 2,700% better.""

I'm new to this project, as I only found it yesterday via Forbes. I'm rather technologically inclined, and I'm quite interested in this; but I've been wondering about routing, as I feel it's an important question to consider.

Assuming the Meshnet is made up of devices connected to each other wirelessly (some wired?) and almost all of them act as nodes that transport messages and can act as an access point, and ideally this network of devices would span the entire planet, then how would routing work?

Imagine I want to send a message from point A (in Colorado, United States) to point B (in Russia) using a chat protocol (something like peer-to-peer IM). How will the devices know which is the correct other device to pass on the message to, the one that will take it closer to (and not farther away from) the intended destination? How will they choose the optimal route, in other words?

If there are no satellites for the Meshnet (or the ones that do transport Meshnet packets have been taken over by tyrannical governments), then I would imagine it ends up having to travel over the Bering Strait, which isn't quite a direct line to Russia.

I also doubt that packets would end up touching every single node physically placed along the way. Messages can travel at nearly the speed of light, and it would be certainly slower to have them hop across 10000 nodes (encumbered by hardware restraints) than 100 nodes between point A and point B.

There is another point to consider: censors/filters/great firewalls are often easily circumvented by taking an alternative route for your network messages. In high school, rather than connect directly to a certain website (which happens to be blocked by the school's filter), I instead connected to my server at home (which is not blocked) and had it connect to the website and route its data over to me over a SOCKS proxy.

If you are able to explicitly tell the network to take your packet in a different direction across the world, then you can easily circumnavigate compromised devices and governmental censors. Say all devices in the Bering Strait region are required to have a government censor installed. Then, rather than try to reach the person in Russia over the Bering Strait, I can instead have the message travel across Greenland, hop over to Iceland, and have it hopefully reach the United Kingdom (probably not likely...), then have it travel across Europe and Asia. Or maybe across Antarctica (highly unlikely), assuming sufficient wireless range.

Finally, what I really like about the idea of an international network based on mesh networking is that it is truly free -- free as in freedom and free as in beer. Wireless connections are like streets transcending highways (built by governments) and toll roads (built by businesses and corporations), because anyone can build a connection between themselves and their friend or neighbor, for free (ignoring the actual costs of radio devices).

There will likely be businesses building Meshnet nodes that aren't free; that is, they are faster or somehow higher-quality and you have to pay for them. But that is completely fine, as long as they are forced to compete with free. In today's Internet, we don't have that. All we have is a world of toll roads, owned by ISPs, which commonly hold a monopoly over large regions.",,False,self,t5_2rju2,True,,,True,t3_mprwz,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/mprwz/how_will_routing_work/,

I know it's not likely to happen, but events could dictate that you need to share data such as crypto keys in unconventional ways. 

Encoding data in to words is nothing new, [PGP has a word list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGP_word_list) that is functional but a bit complicated for use over the phone. It uses odd words that are long and dont encode much data per word. 

[Mnemonic encoder](http://web.archive.org/web/20051109230247/http://www.tothink.com/mnemonic/) is an encoding scheme that can encode 32 bits of data in to three distinct words. The original page is long gone but thanks to [the internet archive](http://archive.org) the data lives on. 

From the site:

&gt;Using the mnemonic encoding makes it practical to use numbers which are too large to be manually handled otherwise. Below are 64 bits from my /dev/urandom device, in hexadecimal and in mnemonic encoding.

&gt; 
&gt; Which one is easier to dictate over the phone? Type into your computer from a piece of paper? Which one is easier to memorize? 

&gt; The mnemonic encoding makes it practical to manually handle *cryptographically significant* amounts of random data. 

&gt; The primary use for which I have compiled this wordlist is for encoding the hash of a public key. I shall refer to the hash of a public key, encoded into mnemonic encoding as a self-certifying identity. A six-word string is about as easy to remember as a phone number and may be used as an identity reference. The association between this identity string and a public key can be verified mathematically without refering to a trusted third party. In certain cases this may make the use of a certificate authority unnecessary.

To be clear, I'm talking about direct communication between PCs, with no internet connection and no router. 

The test project involves a simple file-sharing program that can advertise its availability, and download files from discovered peers. 

I've looked into two methods of doing this. 

The first method involves putting the interfaces in monitor mode and using packet sniffing and injection to receive and send data. By injecting forged broadcast data packets, valid wireless packets can be sent with arbitrary data, bypassing TCP/IP completely. This is as bare-bones as you can get, as far as I can tell, while still using the hardware available. 

This method gives nearly absolute control over the implementation of protocols, as well as giving true anonymity (the addr2 and addr3 fields in the header can be made random, or in fact used to carry payload data). 

There are several disadvantages of this method: it requires packet handling logic to be programmed in software, and it requires using hardware in a somewhat non-standard way, and some drivers currently don't allow the type of access required. 

The second method involves using the ad-hoc 802.11 mode. The clients automatically join a particular network and take a random IP address of the form 10.X.X.X. The the TCP/IP machinery can be used to do broadcasts and connections as usual. This can be made anonymous if the wireless driver allows modification of the hardware address (this is trivial in linux, and can probably be done in other systems as well), so that each time the client comes on-line the hardware address is changed.

The advantage of this method is simplicity of implementation - the socket API is well known, and TCP/IP takes care of the details of reliably sending and receiving data. One disadvantage is poor support with some hardware, and perhaps there are inherent limitations in the design of the ad-hoc mode that limit its usefulness. 

I've implemented both systems (in linux) and can provide code (python) to anyone who's interested. 

EDIT: I'm doing some more work on method #2 right now - I'm trying to create a file system (using fuse on linux) that will automatically create directories for detected peer's shared files.

(from IRC)

I couldn’t agree more!
Have you seen the side bar &gt;&gt; ? It is longer that the 25 posts on subreddit itself.

To begin with.
There are three EFnet channels:

* #cjdns
* #hyperboria
* #projectmeshnet

Most of the people on the IRC are on all of the channels.
All questions can be answered by any of those people. 
Pointing someone to the right channel doesn’t happen often because it is pointless.
And even if we where are going to point users to the right channel it will become a threshold for new people to join the IRC.

Then there is HypeIRC which has a #hyperboria channel of its own.
In my opinion this should not be any in-depth discussions here. We could use EFnet for that. That way more people read it.
We can however keep using #hyperoria@HypeIRC like the ´living room´ for HypeIRC. You join here and chat about Hypeboria sites or anything else.

A list of Project Meshnet related subreddits

* /r/darknetplan
* /r/hyperboria
* /r/darknetplanHW
* /r/dorknet
* /r/MeshnetNews
* /r/Meshnet
* /r/DarkNetPlanOverflow
* /r/Hocnet

This is getting ridiculous.

What is wrong with just /r/darknetplan?
It is the only subreddit with a decent amount of subscribers. We want 1.000.000 subscribers to /r/darknetplan. Not 10 subscribers to 100.000 Subreddits.
Imagine you are new to the project, Where the F* do I start???

Then there are the quadrillion meshlocal subreddits with not a lot of subscribers to any of them.
Why not just use one meshlocal subreddit and share! meshlocal related issues. This way we could learn from each other.
It also has the same problem mentioned above. We could just add [Location] prefixes to titles in the subreddit to make it easier to localize certain posts.

IMHO it should look something along the lines of this:

* IRC
* - #cjdns (Hyperboria == cjdns network, I do not seem to get why there should be a special channel for this)
* - #projectmeshnet
* HypeIRC
* -  #Hyperboria
* - ~ Any Hyperboria only services channel, Like #radio, #hypeirc, #uppit
* Reddit
* - /r/darknetplan
* - /r/Meshlocal

And that is it.
We could do with a lot less, this would make it easier to approach.

QOS and traffic shaping are existing attempts to manage traffic, but the simple rules used to prioritize traffic will never capture the complexity of human motivation. How do you decide if the businessman's email or the Redditors cat picture is more important? 

And what about infrastructure? WiFi will never be able to handle networks in very high density areas even with perfect traffic management the commons of the spectrum is simply too small for everyone. The solution would be wires or IR links to get traffic out of the WiFi spectrum at least until it can leave crowded areas. But that equipment is expensive and the time to maintain it not insignificant. Helping out the network may be good karma, but karma does not buy groceries or pay for equipment.

Both of these problems could cripple Meshnet by making it impossible for it to grow into a truly ubiquitous network without degrading to uselessness. The solution to both of them is simple, money. When bandwidth becomes scarce users could pay various amounts to buy anything from very low priority to top priority bandwidth, prices accept each individuals input about what data is important to them, so that the Redditor can pay top dollar to see that important cat picture instead of delivering the businessman's email about his 3rd meeting today. By selling bandwidth those who provide services in areas where they are needed are rewarded, instead of just karma people who directly help the network are paid for their trouble, cables and IR links, previously a burden, could employ millions. As the new infrastructure lowered the network load in an area bandwidth prices would fall back to near zero at peak times.

First off I would like to be perfectly clear, I agree with the ideology of net neutrality. I believe that all data and websites should be treated equally. The issue is really how ""neutrality"" should be carried out. I think that both sides have valid points. Progressives think that the government should enforce neutrality since it is the corporations who would abuse the power more than the government would. Conservatives think that the free market would be a better regulator than the government since the consumer chooses who they get their Internet from. Both have their points. Both have their flaws. The argument against the progressive view is that once you give the government an ounce of control that would set precedent for further control. Even if the current government would never cross the line, you cannot be sure that future governments won't. After all, laws can be rewritten, new laws can be carried out, and we overthrow our government every four years. The argument against the conservative view is that having corporations potentially abusing their power is just as bad if not worse than the government abusing it since there is very little the individual can do against large monopolistic corporations. Ultimately it comes down to whom do you trust not to abuse the power. The government or the free market? In either case there is potential for abuse.

I think that the only way for a truly free and open Internet is through meshnet technology. A meshnet is a versatile, decentralized, encrypted network where each user acts as an Internet service provider. The regulation of the Internet would fall to the people using it. It is democracy in its purest form. It cannot be taken down nor controlled by one entity. The only way it would go down is if every person using it pulls the plug. Not only does the regulation of the Internet fall to the users but also the infrastructure. Have a bad connection buy a router and set it up as a node. No longer will where you live dictate how you connect to the Internet. Of course, to implement this nationwide existing infrastructure has to be used and maintained and that costs money. What I suggest is that people pay for the amount of data they use and get paid for the amount of data that uses their infrastructure. That way current internet providers still get money and it allows for more competition. Imagine a local coffee house that offers free wifi getting paid for offering free WiFi. Instead of a few ISPs(Time Warner, Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T) getting paid to offer Internet there would be potentially millions. In order for the pay system to work there would have to be some entity that keeps track of how much you use and transmit (though not what you use and transmit) and pays/charges you accordingly. Both the big ISPs and individuals would use the same pay system.

There is a lot of issues, both technological and governmental, that need to be thought out. My hope is that the Open and Free Internet movement will push forward the development of meshnets. 

What do you guys think? Any other ideas on how a nation wide meshnet could be carried out? How can the government help in the development of a meshnet?

If 10 or 20 people are able to create a mesh network and connect to each other, then they could share this bandwidth and save money. This money that they save would cover the cost of the equipment and could eventually be used to expand the mesh.

You can use this to attract more and more people onto the mesh.

Also as the end goal should be to remove your dependence on the backbone, you want to start attracting content onto your local Intranet, which will in turn save money. A good way of doing that would be to offer free or cheap hosting services. Also, if possible, promote these local websites on the mesh.

AOL was a very popular service not too long ago and there main selling point was (in my opinion) that start up page that helped less skilled users get started. I think we could create a similar home page for the mesh network and try to attract a similar group (mainly our own grandparents maybe?). This could be a way to promote local sites, and channel traffic to cached pages.

Once the network covers the city this will open us up to many other possibilities such as allowing all members access to wifi from their phone, and Internet radio from their car.

I think Internet radio in the car is a big step to connecting cities as there is always a line of cars travelling between cities. Creating some kind of radio/router combination that would allow the driver to listen to Pandora, or any of the thousands of free Internet stations available would be huge. First this would be ten times better then the limited selection of stations on Satellite radio that people pay a good chunk of money for each month. Second it would turn the car into another connection. Finally people would pay good money for this which in turn would cover the initial investment.",,False,self,t5_2rju2,False,,,True,t3_na4ph,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/na4ph/become_an_isp/,

I've made a project on Google Code (GIT) so we can start developing whatever firmware, software, protocols, or drivers that we need. It can be found:
[Google Code Project](http://code.google.com/p/global-meshnet)

I've also made a project on ClockingIt to help manage our time and milestones. I'm not very familiar with it so it might not be exactly what we want. I'm a web app developer so I can make any tools we need that way and have them open-source as well. I'm not sure how to add users to it, so just opt-in on Google Code and I'll sort everything out on the 1st.
[Global MeshNet on ClockingIt](http://global-meshnet.clockingit.com)

Here is what we need to start figuring out when the project starts (or whenever you want and in no particular order):

* We need a way of identifying uniquely with different computers (IPv6) ?
* There has to be a way of establishing a DNS of some sort.
* Everything must be in an encrypted protocol.
* Some mathematical equations to determine the fastest route between peers with minimal overhead.
* How people can make their own homebrew or pre-made access points.
* Require a minimum of signal connectivity to connect into the Global MeshNet (to help with reliability and prevent flaky hardware)
* Setup a way of sharing the idea and mapping out potential peers that want to contribute, and see what kind of hardware can happen.
* Try looking into using the power grid to connect MeshNets (like Broadband over Powerline BPL) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_line_communication
* Setup a mechanism to prevent abuse (this will be a feat)

As for my own personal ideas, I'm going to start making some hardware devices to help learn low level hardware / interfaces / circuits to pay for my living and donate to the project. Once I figure out a way to allow anyone to donate and actually see where their money will be going, I will have donating open. We're not using PayPal as they don't allow transactions without a shipped product (though I guess it's donation, but fuck them, it's **our** money damn it). I'd probably have to setup a bank account for it, but I want to make sure everyone can see where their money is going.

We will need:

* Developers
* Dreamers
* Testers
* Organizers

This is the platform I'm presenting to Reddit (and hopefully the world). The open global Internet.

I'm not sure what sort of license this is (despite my pick on google code so please help me on this if you're knowledgeable). I want a license that allows anyone to contribute as long as they commit back to the main project (but are free to branch and create their own projects if it still works with the main code), everyone gets credit to their contributions, the forks or main code are not allowed to be sold or proprietary.

There's really not much information there that isn't already here, but there are a couple of posts that should get the debate started. 

Also, wolfeater and I think that a really great way to get people involved is to allow everybody to set up a community in their city, or area. So you can register on the forum, ask for a community in your area and get moderator rights over it. Kind of like a subreddit.

We've also planned to code a map in which people can add their nodes using the software that we should develop (in the near future, hopefully?), find nodes close to their location, estimate how much power they'll need to communicate with different locations, etc.

Also, feel free to join us on IRC. A couple of us are already having a healthy discussion and getting people to know routing daemons.

Lots of people and pretty low income, don't yet know of other tech-savvy people in the area and hopefully this idea might draw them out if I can implement it.

I think the idea of a neighborhood mesh network is a really good one, especially in a low-income area. I'm not sure if there are any legal issues, but eliminating the requirement of one-wan-uplink-per-home could save a lot of people a lot of money.

I'm envisioning something that to the user looks a lot more like free public wifi than some fancy darknet mesh thing, though that may be what it is in the background.

Maybe this isn't the right sub to float this idea, but I'll go on if it is.

**Phase 1:** AgentSnazz's free wifi!

* Open wireless network broadcast from my house
* Login page upon connection saying what this is, how to contact, etc.
* Login page will also be landing page for things like a message board, classifieds, community calendar, games, file sharing, etc.
* QOS favoring my own devices
* Filtering to protect me from guest's careless illegal activity.

**Phase 2:** A wild geek neighbor appears!

* Friendly neighbor offers his WAN connection as well
* System automatically handles load balancing between uplinks
* Friend can configure his own QOS, filtering will likely be universal, unless the system can route risky traffic through the uplink that chooses allows it.

**Phase 3:** Hardware

* We design/build/purchase an idiot-proof device that clients can put in their home to hard-wire to their computers.
* Maybe this is the same all-in-one device that Agentsnazz and friends are now using to broadcast the signal and connect to the internet.

Thoughts? Suggestions? Discouragement? Rebuke? Praise? Shrugs?

I definitely need to find out how to do this legally:

Early Internet (and BBSes) seem so much simpler than all the high-speed high-bandwidth stuff we demand these days.

How about a single forum for every conceivable topic under the sun?  That was Usenet.  And boards were way more local than they are today, as the costs of long-distance calls meant that the people you chatted and associated with where actually local to you, people you could meet up with fairly easily.

I just discovered an oldschool system that is still running, and still accepting guest logins.

This old text-based ghost-town is a real joy to play with.  Although it is pretty broken, many of the menu options still work, and it is a cool glimpse of the past.

I discovered this by accident a few hours ago, and have been playing around with it ever since.  I am not sure if any other systems like this exist anymore.

If any of you have never had the pleasure of experiencing a real, authentic oldschool community board, point your **telnet client** to ""**telnet.ncf.ca**"" and login as guest.  There is a seemingly endless tree of menu options. Although many of them are broken, you still get an idea of how awesome and vast these old systems where.

Enter ""go"" at the main prompt for a complete list of available commands.

You should all experience this before these last remnants of the early Internet go away forever.

Just think about how much that country would benefit right now if it had set up a wireless ad hoc darknet.


Part of me thinks that a WiFi based darknet will never happen. Eventually satellites are going to be cheap enough to build and launch that hackerspaces will be able to pool together funds to launch one and use it for communication. Once you have a couple satellites you no longer have to worry about users being spread out all over the country. I think this will happen before we are able to build a darknet with enough nodes to actually be useful.

I live in a rural town population ~3,000. I could easily buy an [outdoor access point](http://www.google.com/search?q=Outdoor+Access+Points&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a#q=Outdoor+Access+Points&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=W3j&amp;sa=X&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;tbs=p_ord:p&amp;tbm=shop&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;ei=gnrSTpmhKIibtwf79Zy5DQ&amp;ved=0CAoQuw0oAQ&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=d98391f7096812b4&amp;biw=1570&amp;bih=908), I am leaning towards something like [this one](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4608000&amp;CatId=372) for ~$55. I enable this as a open access point in my town and hook it to an alright PC running Linux.

Because I have a residential ISP and it may violate my terms of service and quickly overwhelm my ISP connection, I would not connect this access point to the Internet. I would instead try to provide useful services directly to the people connected to my access point. I could provide many things, Twitter and Facebook clones, Wikimedia, IRC, Teamspeak, and web sites that provide information about local businesses and organisation, as well as other services. This constitutes some slight usefulness to its users, but not a whole lot. 

So the plan is to create a node by setting up an access point and provide some web based services. The future goal would be to interconnect with other nodes and bridge and/or interlink services. A second access point device that is more specialised to be a 'client bridge' would be able to shoot a few miles to a distant client bridge connecting nodes.

This sounds like a good baby step. People seem focused on using mesh-networking and P2P networking. Maybe for some applications that may be important, but for me I seem to only need an access point. We could put together a remastered Linux distribution that comes with a good selection of services out of the box, making sprouting of other access points easier. Adoption and development of services who can be distributed would provide for the future concept of interconnected nodes.

1346465229.0,54,self.darknetplan,z61j4,"Concepts and misconceptions: An adventure in networking. (what cjdns is and is not relative to other software, and why you should care)",71,17,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/z61j4/concepts_and_misconceptions_an_adventure_in/,"After some amusing discourse with the folks on i2p's IRC, I've come to the realization that there are a large number of misconceptions about cjdns, and its suitability for a particular purpose. This post will center around two lists, one of things that cjdns does not do, and probably won't ever do, the other of things cjdns does that are of interest because other solutions don't do them, or have chosen other solutions to the same problem.

Without further ado, here are the have-nots:

* Anonymity. This is a big ticket item, and the most common misconception I've heard complained about. Cjdns is not Tor, i2p, freenet, or any of their friends. Cjdns happens to, as a side effect, not reveal your IP address directly to users of a service or to providers of a service, other than your cjdns address. This is not anonymity, and treating it as such can only hurt you. Your node is identifiable based on the path taken to it, which is clearly visible to anyone along the path. If you are looking for an anonymous real-time darknet, i2p fits the bill, as does the use of Tor's .onion domains.
* Name service. While we may some fine day have this, we don't have it now. We do have services like HypeDNS that allow you the use of a nameserver overlay, which means you can publish a name, however that's very much a hack. This is an important item, as cjdns' man in the middle protection relies on you being able to check a public key against an address, and if the address can be replaced with another (by man in the middling your name service), then your whole session can be intercepted. In i2p this is handled with what basically amounts to a hosts file for the .i2p domain space, and all of the major darknet, meshing, and peer to peer systems have worked on mechanisms for resolving names for some time. Namecoin is a currently functioning service, though not very popular at the moment.
* Persistence. When your cjdns instance is offline, any services or sites you host are offline. This is mostly in comparison with Freenet, and not a misconception I've seen in action yet, but I feel it's important to mention. Cjdns routes packets, it does not host sites of any kind without you running some server software behind it. If you're looking for that sort of thing, the answer is Freenet.
* A gateway. Cjdns will not under any condition take you out to the internet. It can route you to a proxy, or to a gateway host, but it's up to the user's software to tunnel their outbound traffic, and non-cjdns packets will be dropped by cjdroute unconditionally. If you want to surf the open web anonymously, you're looking for Tor.


With that being said, here are a few unique (and not so unique) things it does have:

* No central authority. Cjdns addresses are not allocated or pooled, they are directly generated from a cryptographic key with no confirmation from the network. The design allows for anycast to work simply by two nodes sharing the same public key, and there is no central server, nor in fact any software needed to run the entire network except for the same daemon all the peers run.
* Actual IP addresses, real TCP/IP. Cjdns does route IPv6 packets as part of its basic function, and cjdns addresses are IPv6 addresses in the yet-unallocated IPv6 private space fc00::/8, and services are hosted using a normal network stack, without the use of proxies or gateways.
* Non-homogeny. Cjdns is designed to work on mixed networks with very flexible operational parameters. Cjdns provides its own link-layer protocol effectively, which is currently mostly tunneled using UDP, however it could work with few design changes directly on ethernet, or on 802.11.
* End-to-end encryption. This is very important to any system, and just like i2p or Tor .onion services, cjdns encrypts every single packet.
* Point-to-point encryption. This is less critical, but more important for using cjdns in an unfriendly environment. Packets between two hosts, after the cryptographic session is established between them, look like random noise, with no identifying pattern other than the UDP port the traffic is sent on.
* End-to-end signatures and node identity confirmation. This is somewhat special, as it's more closely related to IPsec than to a darknet. This and the lack of anonymity are mostly what set cjdns aside and make it totally unsuited to building a darknet. Any node sending an IP packet or route advertisement of any kind will sign it, verifying that it was the sender, forward and back, no matter the carried protocol. If you have the correct cjdns address for a host, it is not possible to inject packets into the stream, as each end will simply see a bad signature, and drop the injected packets.

Some points are also relevant to discussion, but not very valid. Some examples:

* &lt;other software&gt; uses Java!

Yes, yes it does. And? Java, like any language, can be done well, or done poorly. This is not an argument against either i2p or freenet.

* &lt;software&gt; is so much better than &lt;other software&gt;!

Facts, please? For the most part, the software packages available to us now could actually complement each other, simple VPN software, cjdns, i2p, tor, and freenet could all live in harmony on the same machine, doing cool stuff like adding some cjdns peers over i2p.


* TL;DR: cjdns is not tor, i2p is not a wireless meshnet, tor is not a darknet, and freenet doesn't route.",,False,self,t5_2rju2,1346485203.0,,,True,t3_z61j4,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/z61j4/concepts_and_misconceptions_an_adventure_in/,

1339424788.0,53,self.darknetplan,uw64x,build your own routing hardware,70,17,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/uw64x/build_your_own_routing_hardware/,"i wrote a lot of stuff about this a while ago and forgot about it, i do not know if it would even work or not, but here it is.

&gt;**warning**: this is a little ""raw"" and i would like to edit it for clarity and consistency. i have no idea if this would even work or if it contains only reasonably factual information
&gt;
&gt;Lately I have been doing a fair amount of research into building your own router out of hardware like Micro ATX boards with atom and similar cpu's built in. I do not know if this fits here exactly, but I think this is a very good platform to run an early mesh network off of. Also note, that I am not even entirely sure that you can just hook up a switch to a router to get more Ethernet ports, in which case, I think you would need to buy expensive multi-port NICs, and by extension, bust the budget and render this pretty much useless due to costs.
&gt;
&gt;This seems like it would be better than most (if not all) consumer routers out today. I figure this could cost from free to less than $350 (buying all new ""high end"" parts).
&gt;
&gt;I figure this would be much better than just buying a plastic box for several reasons. One, you can run any software you want that runs on x86. it can be upgraded (change out NICs and wireless cards), and easily reprogrammed or reformatted with the latest software. it is far more powerful than any plastic box out today.
&gt;
&gt;So as I said above, I “figure” these things. And the low cost depends on things like, connecting a cheapish $30-60 switch to the router so you have enough ports. Other issues would include making sure the hardware you buy would work with Linux, out of the box with little or no additional drivers or configurations required, if you are buying hardware for a certain OS, why not make sure it works great for your application?
&gt;
&gt;Some hardware I think would (should) work great is below. Please tell me if something is just broke or wont work or isn't compatible.
&gt;
&gt;[Mobo+cpu](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131697) ~$130  (this can possibly be replaced with a cheaper component, although this mobo has 2 pci express slots, which is great for future expansions vs pci, which is a dieing breed)
&gt;
&gt;[pci NIC](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833106121), [pci express NIC](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833106033) ~$30 for Intel or [pci](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833166002) ~$15, [pci express](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833166015) ~$25 for Rosewill
&gt;
&gt;[wireless card pci express](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833166063) ~$20 [pci wireless](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833166038)
&gt;
&gt;[1 gig ram](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148147) ~$10
&gt;
&gt;[4(5) port switch](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833122128) ~$40 (this can be changed depending on your needs and should not cause problems)
&gt;
&gt;All NICs are gigabit, all wireless support wireless n at 2.4 ghz with wpa2 support(or is all this marketing gimmick and it is all done in software, or is this genuine and you need actual hardware support?). If you notice something incorrect or wont work, please say something. All devices should be plug and play for linux, if they are not, please say so, because this is intended to be an easy to build system, not a hassle to hunt down annoying stuff like drivers. Things missing from the list are, disk storage and a power supply. I didn't list a disk, because you could just use a spare flash drive or hard drive. keep in mind, if you use a hard drive, you need to take it into account when buying a power supply. I didn't list a power supply because buying a traditional power supply seemed wasteful, so i was looking for other alternatives like ac -&gt; nvolt 20+4 pin connectors. It would be great if someone could suggest a solution for the motherboard connectors and possible molex and sata connectors. (preferably without a traditional computer power supply)
&gt;
&gt;I apologize in advance if newegg does not support you guys outside the US or something. I will also admit i am slightly brand biased.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;As for software, it think this would double as a great learning experience for users like myself who want to learn networking stuff, so i would likely dive into the deep end with Debian or something and learn how to use iptables and such. Eventually, I would like to post a step by step guide on how to set one up, once/if i decide to do it myself. The end goal here is to make a great starting guide split into sections starting from basic linux terminal stuff, through things like ssh and ftp, to complicated things like iptables. This all depends on interest in such a project, but i am off right now, and i have time (especially to learn iptables)

I'll check back when it's up and running consistently.""

Since then I have thought about it, and sitting by and doing nothing is the worst way to get anything done.  If I actually believe in stopping censorship, or I do not want to be censored, I need to act.

There are some people who think this is going to be done with a newly manufactured device! Let's get it together!

First of all,

**The technology already exists!** A $60 router can be flashed with Linux, which is just a matter of reading model numbers and following instructions correctly, and used for this. There's no need to daydream about getting large-scale manufacture of some special device. Don't reinvent the wheel!

**For now, fuck PR!** Once people are getting busted for the shit they post on Facebook, they're going to join the Mesh for privacy even if it's called RapeNet! However, we've already got a handful of awesome names, including **Web 3.0.** Consider this a problem solved!

**Agree on mesh software!** The sooner this stops being a subreddit and becomes a real life project, the better shape it'll be in by the time the state tries to crack down on it! Globalizing it is irrelevant right now; get off the ground, then think about going to orbit!

**What can I do, right now?** The most realistic course of action is to use existing technology, existing software, deploy them locally, and **start a Mesh group** to grow the network. Here's a list of what you can do. A single mesh node will cost around $60, but **you must get the model number exactly right!**

**What routers can I use for the Mesh?** OpenWRT compiled a [list of supported devices](http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#supported.hardware.-.router.type) for you! Pick any router listed on this page with **an ATHEROS wireless NIC,** (AR#### is also an Atheros chip) **at least 4 MB flash memory,** and **at least 16MB RAM.** The expected price is about $60, but it varies.

**What about software?** [Nightwing](http://nightwing.lugro-mesh.org.ar/en/)'s got you covered. That's right, zero configuration! The image is preconfigured to form the Mesh! Following the OpenWRT guide to unlock your device and flashing Nightwing onto it is roughly an hour of work on your computer.

**This costs money!?!** Hell yeah it does! I hope it comes as a shock to no one that the Mesh isn't going to come out of thin air, and if you don't want corporations to own it, it means that **we, the reddit-browsing everypersons** of the internet, must own the infrastructure! Now, some people can't afford to lay down $60, some people just can't be bothered to contribute anything more than text to a cause, and others are already taking action! The bottom line is, if you can imagine a time in the future where you've already done this, and **see yourself running one** of many nodes in the area, and you can feel glad that you've become part of the **real-world Mesh community**, and you were asked whether you'd trade that for $60 and an hour at some point in the past, what would you decide?

1322289102.0,50,self.darknetplan,mpnmt,Meshnet: A Primer on Confusion,60,10,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/mpnmt/meshnet_a_primer_on_confusion/,"There has been quite a bit of discussion about what mesh is.  I’m going to do my best to describe what I understand and where I believe the confusion is coming from. This is all IMO, **I'm not a part of Meshnet and I don’t represent anyone aside from myself**.   


**A tale of two systems**

A wifi network is not the same as Mesh. One of the biggest headaches when it comes to meshnet is the fact that it encompasses two distinct systems that use the same damn terminology (this isn’t Mesh’s fault). 
The first system is the mesh/internet (the meshnet) this is the thing that will give you website pages this is “The Internet” and I mean that most literally, this is where your porn be at, this is where reddit lives. 
The second system is the ability to access mesh (the wireless portion of mesh), this is the thing you connect to when you are at home or at a coffee house, your phone you use 3g and at home you use wifi but you are still connected to THE INTERNET.    

I will be referring to the Mesh-internet as “The Meshnet” and the wireless access grid as “The WAG”; I was going to go with WiMesh or Meshfi but I really wanted to have two completely different names for the purpose of this conversation.
The WAG has always existed. The WAG is 3g, local wifi, community grids… and The WAG will continue to exist in some form or another. Building WAGs are simple. Lots of cities have done it. You put a whole bunch of routers together and you have them talk to each-other. If someone connects to these routers they will connect to the internet.   

**This is not a mesh system**. At this point we may as well start drawing lines and jumping on sides because the first thing you should say is “Didn’t you just describe that as a mesh system”? The short answer is no, the long answer is yes. In the most literal sense it is. But for the purpose of Meshnet it is not. Here’s the best way I can describe it:  

It is true that just about any system is a network/mesh/web of interconnected things. Look at [Diagram #1]( http://i.imgur.com/JKvg7.jpg). This diagram represents a wifi grid. Each black dot is a router that does not have internet access and each red dot is a router that does have internet access. You are the blue dot.  As a blue dot you are looking to access the internet, the black and red dots will help you find the internet. As a blue dot you will walk into range of a black or red dot and it will connect you. Sometimes a black dot will have to jump through another black dot to reach the internet. This is fine. If a single entity dies the network will reconfigure itself as each dot looks to find “the internet”.   

In this system there is a DEFINED GOAL. And NONE of the dots hold any unique value. They either provide internet or they do not. That is it. All of the black dots function the same way. All of the red dots function the same way. If a new node is created the nodes around it will adjust, if it is deleted they will adjust. To put it another way: THERE IS NO REASON FOR DOT ""H"" TO KNOW THAT DOT ""U"" EXISTS.  

**That’s a WAG, what about a Meshnet?**

Now, this is why it gets confusing. Let’s say you are now connected to Meshnet, what does that look like? Well check out [Diagram 2]( http://i.imgur.com/qdcNg.jpg). Right away you should be saying – what the hell is this noise? Why are all these different colors? Well in a truly distributed system you have two challenges – either each computer is a replication (meaning each computer has a copy of the entire internet and all dots are the same color) or some computers have copies of some information while other computers have copies of other information (and all dots are different colors).   

Shit just got real – all I want to do is get the address of the closest Chinese restaurant. As odd as it may sound this is a really freaking complicated request to sort out in a distributed system. I’ll make it super easy for you; U,T and S all have the information I need and I somehow know this (but I don’t know where U, T or S is in the system).  I know what I want, but I don’t know how to find it. If I’m connected to point A how many nodes will I pass through to reach T? The answer is ALL OF THEM. I don’t know what direction to start so the only way to solve this problem is to build a path-finder (aka super fun exponential time) – say there is an average of 4 connections to each node, if the two nodes are more than 5 hops I’ll have jumped through 1,024 nodes. After 8 hops I’ll have traversed 65k nodes. Ten hops is more than a million. Twelve hops is sixteen million. 18 hops is 68 billion… and so on…  

This is what people mean when they talk about scalability. The WAG does not have this issue. The WAG simply looks for internet (are you a red circle?) Once the WAG has found that it KEEPS it. The WAG has to make hops but it only has to do it when something goes down. The Mesh is making hops ALL THE TIME. Where’s that Chinese restaurant again? Oh wait I actually feel like Thai. Maybe I should get a movie, where’s the nearest video rental. And so on. The WAG looks for one thing and never changes The Meshnet is continuously going over the servers trying to find and chain information together.
  
**Thanks**  
That’s all I wanted to say. I hope this helps someone. I know that was quite a bit to ram through and I hope someone clever’er than I can summarize / critique / tldr / refute my points as I would enjoy the learning experience.

It should be fairly robust legally as well in case someone ""accidentally"" downloaded/uploaded copy-written content to the device.  The user simply claims that they did not know that the device was ""hacked"".  


The part that is really interesting though and where my post stems from is this...   Can I power this thing with a solar panel?  If I can then I could, with enough financial abandon, distribute these things in my local area.  This would separate the device from my home making it practically impossible to trace back to an owner especially in an urban area/college setting.

Question #1 - Why are you even sticking with DNS? If you're going to rewrite the book, why not choose something that might work better with a decentralized philosophy and be backwards compatible with existing DNS servers?

Question #2 - If you're going to decentralize the name servers, I suggest a trust-based peer system, something akin to a PGP key signing.

example:

I have a darknet server. I call it ""Darkmass.dom"" (.dom for domain) and want to register it so I can receive and pass traffic. Heck, maybe I want to offer hosting?  

So I generate a domain key and sign it.  Then I  email it to a friend that has darknet server. He signs my key and sends it back.  I install the key, so now I trust him and he trusts me and we can pass traffic with no problems. Lather, Rinse, Repeat.

So how does this solve the domain name issue?  Keys.  The keys contain the domain name and trust. Darknet servers pass keys between each other, and those keys contain signatures, and that can be verified against other trusted keys and signatures. 

So Joe Citizen connects to the darknet, visits any domain he wants, and all this is invisible in the background.

Read about FIDOnet and PGP key signing to get the concept I'm suggesting.  You don't need centralized domain servers - all you need is servers that trust each other and keep a list of trusted keys.  If you determine that ""MIB.dom"" is a bad site, you can disable that key or possibly flag it as suspect.


Was I coherent?

edit: I guess what I'm trying to explain is that you would use special software to run a darknet server. That software would include a type of DNS server that passes keys back and forth between the servers.  It would update the location of the server, assign it trust, and provide routing information to clients.  I suppose there could be name collisions, but perhaps that can be worked around. It was easy enough in the BBS days, the phone number was the key and the name of the BBS was just advertising.",,False,self,t5_2rju2,True,,,True,t3_sldwm,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/sldwm/decentralized_dns_idea/,

Also, apps which successfully allow your phone to broadcast a wireless network already exist (people do this to connect to internet through their phone, tethering).

We should write a mesh networking app for Android. Make it operate as a separate network device (you can connect via 3g, WiFi, or mesh). While someone could operate a gateway to the internet to help everyone else get online, the primary focus would be emergency (or covert) communications.


Once this app is built, other people can write apps which use our app. First you install our mesh app, then you install their Occupy Wall Street app which uses Google Maps to show points where toilets are available or there's free food or something. Where would the points be stored? I'm envision this working like Freenet (decentralized storage). While the author of the OWS app could implement that himself, I really think we should write the code for the massive distributed cache and provide an API.


Like I said before, there has been *some* research and beta apps that cover mesh networking, but they're all about connection sharing, not communications within the mesh. I understand this is a very bold project, but we'd be doing more than just programming, we'd be venturing into uncharted territory. If we did this, I wouldn't be surprised if it was mentioned on several high profile websites. I sure as hell wouldn't mind adding it to a resume. I've done Android programming before, but I'll need help with this.

My username is NexusXtremeOne, but you can call me Nex.

I got out of college just when the economy crashed. I'm sure many here have experienced the problems described in the most recent issue of Newswseek (http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/15/are-millennials-the-screwed-generation.html) Upset, I figured that given a few years, things would return to normal and maybe be even better that ever.

Then I saw this: (http://2wanderlust.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/futurism-got-corn-graph-631-thumb.jpg?w=450&amp;h=368)

From the day we were born, we were fed a metanarrative. A narrative where everything was right with the world, everything would end with a happy ending, and everyone was special. Tyler Durden elaborated upon it:

&gt;*""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.""*

Long story short: Our generation and our future is doomed to the same scenario John B. Calhoun created in his mouse utopia.

That is why I am making this proposal. An alliance between subreddits with the aim of finding salvation for our generation and world. The Occupy movement has good ideas, but they're horribly organized and very prone to infiltration.The following are being considered as member candidates for this NexGen Alliance:

What do you suggest I should add or do to it?

If you want to help out, please do so. Also, what could I do to lighten the bloat on Firefox?

And I will probably expand from the browser to add chat programs and stuff. What should I add? Sooner or later, I will probably even turn it into a Linux distro if the need shows itself.

Notice that this is and will be built for Anonymous. I will make a more Reddit friendly version if you don't need the hax, but remember that in any new network, your fates are intertwined.

Textual information, Images, Video and Audio.

Data is great too, but a big roadblock for a darknet is bandwidth.

Text can compress A LOT. Gzip is okay, but if you use paq8 instead you can compress a site by a further 3x at least.
Compared to uncompressed html, you can get the filesize down to just 10% of the original. Effectively making 4KB/s into 40KB/s.

H.265 compression has huge potential to save bandwidth for images and videos used on the internet. VP9 could also have big potential here. With up to 5x reduction compared to jpeg with little noticeable image loss, and 3x without it being noticeable at all. 

With these compression technologies, if it was a standard that website owners used, we could effectively turn a 5KB/s connection into a 35KB/s connection.
Obviously not with 'data' but with loading times of websites, pages and information.

Data can also be compressed much much better than LZMA with Paq8.

We could use extreme compression to turn a low bandwidth meshnet into something that's always fast and instant for web browsing as long as you had 15KB/s, and fast and instant for video streaming if you had 40KB/s or higher.

Here's a fuckload of information on text compression, it's amazing stuff, and it could make a huge difference if everyone was implementing it.

So a quick recap is that I'm making a short info-graphic animation to help explain the MeshNet to people who have never encountered it or have no technical skills whatsoever.

Part 1 above is my first WIP thread, which has a basic intro and such. Part 2 has the basic working script **WHICH STILL NEEDS FEEDBACK.** Seriously, I need to know how accurate/easy to follow it is.

Anyway, on to this thread;

changes in my University schedule has made me have to push forward the production of this animation, so i have to have it roughly finished in 6 or so weeks.

I have done more animation to show the visual style, along with some more elements that are going into it. It can be found [here](http://vimeo.com/41055021). I desperately need the technical and artistic feedback that this community can provide, as I want this to be as accurate as possible, so that it could go in the sidebar and also be spread to help create interest in this project.

It is quite the opposite. I only want to make sure that our efforts are dedicated to something truly useful.

As such, I think we need to ask ourself the question: why do we need to go it alone?

Why is it better to make all new infrastructure (wiki, IRC, forum, etc) than to join forces with folks that are doing the same thing, and use existing tools? Seems like a reinvention of the wheel to me.

I know that I'll probably take some flak for this, and I'm fine with that, because I do think it's important.

Also, for full disclosure, I've got a dog in the fight: I'm one of the founders of the Free Network Foundation.


I'm not saying that there's no good reason to do what you're doing. If you're really doing something novel, then it does make sense. But just throwing up some flashed WRTs solves nothing. It is an access solution only, and an unscalable one at that.

We've got to think longer term, and I'm not sure that I see that happening here. Please consider the notion that we should be building better tools, not using the same tools that have failed to make lame attempts.


Again, I do not mean to discourage. I think what's happening here is great. I just want to pose tough questions, because it helps move things forward.

Because of this I believe that the best way to get this technology into the average users hands, is to offer a better commercial product than the others in the same business.

Since the business is internet infrastructure, the competitors are the service providers. Offering a more reliable, faster and cheaper product than the competition shouldn't be hard then?

*Scenario 1* - Large ISP

My initial idea is to purchase an internet connection for resale from one of the local providers, delivered to a central point with good possibilities for wireless communication. Then set up a CJDNS based wireless station, and distribute pre-configured routers to customers in an area around (say a radius of 2 km).

Adding more coverage would basically be the process over again. One could probably get away with delivering routers quite a distance outside of the station coverage as well, as long as they have other nodes to connect to.

In Oslo, Norway, where I live, a private 5/0.5 Mbps connection from the biggest ISP ([Telenor](http://translate.google.no/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;prev=_dd&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.telenor.no%2Fprivat%2Fbredband%2F)) costs about $50/month, while a 1 Gbps fiber connection for resale costs about $1000-1500/month. Now, if we split the fiber connection on 200 customers, they would all get a minimum of 5/5 Mbps out on the internet, for a cost of ~$5 each.

Customers would also benefit from communication between each other, as it would always transfer at max possible speeds. When not everyone is using their max capacity, the other users would get increased speeds for that duration.

Calculate in a monthly cost of maintenance and hardware for each user, say $20 for a total of $25 cost/customer/month, and you are still delivering a faster and better service for half the price.

(My calculations are rough, at best.)

*Scenario 2* - Neighborhood ISP

Let's forget delivering to a massive area, and keep it to a neighborhood sized ISP. Say i can get a synchronous 200 Mbps connection to my apartment, and I want to share that connection with about 20 people around the area (max distance 200m).

In terms of both scenarios:

* Is anything I've stated bullshit?
* Is it viable?
* What kind of equipment would be needed?
* Is current wireless technologies sufficient?
* Is CJDNS right technology? Commotion Wireless?
* How would this affect a user's normal internet usage? (Connecting to an IP-address on the internet?)

I feel like at this point, either having an intranet set up to allow communications (Serval Mesh) or having it just connected to the regular old internet just has more uses, and thus will work better for getting people involved.

I wrote this lengthy paper outlining my ideas on the operation of a truly anonymous network. Basically what we do is arrange a bunch of nodes in a P2P network, through which we can find more peers. Then we establish tunnels going through any number of nodes which can then end at given destination (like tor). 

We store the information about hidden services and peers on the network using a distributed hash table (not like tor on one server). We also make it possible to open ""remote listening sockets"" through which others can connect to our peer without knowing it's location. And then we have a full blown system for: hidden services, anonymous accessing of other nodes, and storing of data in a completely decentralized fashion. 
 
This paper also brings up some ideas on using PGP on social networks for cool effects such as easy way to ""search"" for posts by some speciffic user id (posts which are signed with public keys for integrity control and distributed all over in the p2p network). And also some other things. Check the paper.

1358281081.0,41,self.darknetplan,16my4h,Suggestions for building a multi-service node similar to PirateBox?,47,6,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/16my4h/suggestions_for_building_a_multiservice_node/,"I'm so glad to see there are actively-developed projects designed to provide alternative networking infrastructure, and have started thinking about getting into the action by building something very similar to David Darts' [PirateBox](http://wiki.daviddarts.com/Piratebox), but with multiple capabilities in the same unit.  Some things I'm considering are:

* file sharing (like the PirateBox already does);
* chat (text and voice);
* Web proxy;
* Tor relay;
* media streaming via VLC

I'd like to make as many of these services available simultaneously on the same device as possible, and I'd like to include the option of either plugging it into AC or carrying it in my backpack and running it on a battery pack.

I've only recently started looking at single-board systems to use.  I had considered using the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/), but I had the sense that running all that on one Pi board might stress it a bit so I started looking around for a slightly more powerful alternative and found HardKernel's [ODroid-X2](http://www.hardkernel.com/renewal_2011/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G135235611947), which has the exact same processor as the Samsung Galaxy S3 and can run either Android or Ubuntu.

Some other things I can think of that I would need are:

* power supply;
* moderately large (500GB at least) USB drive for file sharing;
* WiFi adapter(s) for simultaneous access;
* various pieces of software to make all the services work (obviously)

While I'm fairly experienced with PC Linux, the single-board scene is totally new to me, so I thought I'd ask for feedback here.  Am I reinventing the wheel or completely barking up the wrong tree, or does what I'm envisioning seem at all reasonable?  If it does, can anyone suggest specific hardware or software that might make this workable?

1354446966.0,41,self.darknetplan,145bfg,A question for you all in the community ,57,16,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/145bfg/a_question_for_you_all_in_the_community/,"Hello all in the Meshnet/Darknet community.
As some of you may have heard I released my [DuskNet project at ToorCon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrZWm3sd4Qs) this year, I have had great feedback and a bunch of people asking about the project and where it is going. Now I come to you all to get some feedback on what you all would feel is the most effective for the Meshnet/Darknet community. 

**Quick background:**
About 5 months ago I saw this community on reddit, I have been part of other meshnet and darknet communities for some time but never really looked at the reddit community. I saw a large focus on WiFi and other forms of communication but did not see much on utilizing cellular technology within the meshnet / darknet. Since most of my expertise in cellular I decided that I should build a little box that uses both WiFi and cellular to communicate to the larger meshnet/darknet; and DuskNet was born. 

The project has changed a little bit since then. DuskNet is the open source alternative to the “internet in a box” that deployed by other countries (US, UK, Etc) to countries who’s Govs has shutdown common communication paths (Egypt, Syria, etc). This box could also be used in a Meshnet community as a rapid response to if your local government shuts down or censors communication through devices like your laptop or cellular communication device. 

**Where I am at now:**
In my talk at ToorCon I talk about version 2.0 and what I have been working on with that. I have been jamming on that and have some good feedback from those who I have been testing the gear with. People are happy with it and like how much smaller it has become (without the SDR in it) and how much cheaper it is (case + main board + 3 radios = a little under 1000USD). 

**The impasse:**
Since this is an open source internet in a box solution I want to know what the meshnet / darknet community thinks will better everyone. I have 3 choices on a path I can go on. I am fine with all 3 paths, just want to see what others think before I pick one, since this is a project to better this community. 



Path 1.

I start building/configuring the units on the cheap. I try to find the cheapest hardware that I can to build the DuskNet comms boxes with, that still meet the requirements that I have (heat, power (both in consumption and dbm output) antennas, etc.). The cases will be a little bigger and not as rugged but they would do. 

Path 2.

I start building/configuring the units to be as hardcore as I can. This means they will be more expensive but they will also kick 1000 times more ass then the first units. They will be tiny, powerful, rugged (IP68 – maybe even mil 810, but that testing cost a lot). They will have extreme capability and will have lower power consumption in comparison. These will be units would be a true work of art. 

Path 3.

Work on both. Yes I know everyone is going to say do this, but this would mean that everything will take a lot longer and parts will have to be compromised. 

Path 1 is more for the DIYer while Path 2 is more for the people who would be using it in other countries. 

**Full discloser:**

I am all for path 2 but I want to see if the larger meshnet / darknet community would be behind something like this. I am not looking at making a quick buck out of this, but I am looking at what would be the most effective for the community. Path 2 is way more expensive, but also superior in every way compared to Path 1. With that said, Path 1 will allow for more DIYers to have the setups in their hands to tinker with. 


**Summary:**
The DuskNet project is to replace the so called “internet in a box”, it runs its own services, it has its own littler internet that others can contribute too, and it is meant to give people the ability to communicate when their government has taken that right away. Each node can be configured in a different way, but that is out of the scope of this post. 
DuskNets goal is simple, communications for all. 

Look forward to what you all have to say.

P.S. if there is spelling/grammar problems in this post, sorry, I am much better at math and building comms gear then I am at English.

For those of you who have questions as well please ask here and I will update first post if I think they are good. This will be updated with answers to the questions as well as more questions.

All answers get upvotes of thanks!

I'd have to say the first questions are the following:

.

**Does it always require hundreds of dollars of equipment to actually protect your privacy online?** If not, then what free or inexpensive solutions can I use to protect my privacy?

*If your just looking to protect your privacy online from corporations, then the projects that this subreddit have spawned are waaay overkill. Get a good proxy, install Noscript, AdBlock+ and PrivacyChoice TrackerBlocker &amp; you should be fine. If you want privacy, Tor is an excellent service. Proxies are also extremely useful for average (not high download/upload) browsing. Be careful though, as both proxies and TOR can see any passwords you use. However, If you're getting this impression about costs from the posts in this subreddit, you have it all wrong. The darknet project is about setting up an unregulated internet for the purpose of avoiding shutdown.*

.

**How not-private is my privacy online?** Should I be worried?

*It is really up to you to decide if you feel comfortable with every major company and the US Government tracking exactly what you do online. When your computer sends information outside your house/network, it is accompanied by an IP address (think of a home address). Anything you send information to can see your IP address, because it needs it to send information back. These sites can use geocities tools to find your general location. ISPs can match your account with and IP, and see all the data that you have been sending and receiving. So, basically, you are always being watched.*

.

**Why is your privacy online so important to you?** I know you could just say, ""well duh!"" but no I'm being serious. 

*Essentially, the average redditor has a group of people following them around on the internet, taking notes on what sites they visit, what they say &amp; how long they stay on a site. We have no way to stop it, but it would be nice to change that because most people would find the concepts of how we are being watched very creepy.*

.

**What got you interested in the subjects related to this subreddit?**

.

**What are some misconceptions about darknet and similar decentralized ISPs that we should consider?** I would hate to find out the misconceptions along the way through negative experiences.

*One should not call groups similar to darknet decentralized ISPs, its much more accurate to call them Community Wireless Networks. People think networks like MeshNet and Tor are a haven for illegal activity. While they have their fare share of it, so does every other network in the world.*

.

**What are some important vocabulary pieces that we should get familiar with?** I'm talking about names/nicknames for specialized hardware or actions that the average person won't be familiar with.

*IP addresses, VPN, Encryption, P2P, Mesh Networking, NLoS (near or non-line of sight), LoS (Line of Site), PtP (Point to Point) and PtMP (Point to MultiPoint).*

This has been brought up before but no one has implemented it. It would probably be quite slow (14kbps) but very useful in the event of getting a few tweets out during an emergency. The idea is simple, using the phones internal dialer implement a software modem application that can dial any number and use that number as data. The other advantage is there are many free old dial-up numbers around the globe which can be used freely. This would in turn allow one to share this connection with other devices to help the mesh infrastructure. ^^

* Hi Mr. Jennings,
My name is Ryan Shannon and I have recently come across FidoNet in my pursuit of decentralized alternative internet solutions. The way FidoNet is set up is brilliant and I would like to ask for your advice.
As you know, the internet as we have come to know it is changing rapidly and I fear that it will become more restricted and censored in the next ten years. Currently, I am part of a group that is trying to build a ""Meshnet"" (Basically, a decentralized node-to-node wireless internet) that seems almost impossible. I was wondering if you thought it would be feasible to create a network like FidoNet but decentralized? I think that this is a viable solution to my group's problem. I would love to have your input on this because you basically started it all.

What He Wrote:    

* FidoNet was a protocol designed around dialup telephone network and modems and 0.002GHz cpus and 640K (not M, or G) of RAM. There's better solutions for today's technology. Don' t underestimate the reliance on the telco network -- that's 90% of the problem. The wifi type mesh ideas are very simplistic; it's also not new, and range and radio density and channel management etc are the problem. Software layer on top isn't really the issue today. These are *systems*, not standalone components. There are certainly an infinite number of things (resources, solutions, and problems) that i am not aware of -- but if the first thought is to software, then the project is starting out misguided, imho.
The medium is most of the problem, i'd start there.

As far as I understand, as pointed out by [TomSwirly](http://www.reddit.com/user/TomSwirly) in the post [You're going about this all wrong!](http://redd.it/mr7pq), one of the biggest issue with the mesh networks, it's the lack of hardware/infrastructure to cover as much land as possible.

I was thinking that maybe, trying to build and sell a small robot that is at the same time a wifi router, a web server and meshnet access point could bring money and access points to the project (and friends hopefully!).

Maybe it's something crazy and there are several hardware issues that is hard to solve (like battery life), but I like the idea of a robot that can cooperate with other neighbor ""meshbots"", providing applications for their users (sort of apple/android application market) in change of more friends (new neighbor meshbots)... (sorry for my English if it's not clear).

Just to be more clear.

I buy/build this meshbot, I connect my laptop to it and I point my browser to its IP address. The web application installed on the meshbot provide me a list of available channels/applications/communities, or if the meshbot it's too far from an other meshbot, it uses internet (but it will complain till you don't find him a friend).

We could equip the meshbot with a small storage (SSD?) and use something like plan 9 so that as more meshbot we get as more our ""cloud"" will grow up.

I'm a visionary and I see myself how hard could be to build a meshbot like this, but coming down to hearth, we could probably build something similar, like a wifi access point, but smarter than what exists (with the services above described).

Would it make sense? What do you think?

Clarification: The idea is to build something that is nice and useful for most of the people, that will use the meshnet as the network infrastructure. On the other side we will use the meshbot to grow upo the meshnet itself.

The problem with using IP addresses, of course, is that they're difficult for humans to memorize and type, and they're susceptible to phishing attacks because you can't be arsed to check every character. Same thing with .onion URLs on Tor. I've also been thinking about how Chrome allows you to assign your own name for your bookmark of a web page, and when you type in your own name for a web page in the address bar, it drops down as a suggestion.

So what if, like, this could be done for meshnet sites, with users allowed to bookmark domain name-less sites with their own name, e.g.  ""My Cousin's Site,"" and they could just type in the nickname in the address bar? Not only that, but what if the address bar displayed the nickname in place of the IP address, so `[2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334]` becomes `[Wikipedia example site]`?

Supposing you commute once per day, a 1TB hard drive in your vehicle could be used to establish a 102 Mbps bidirectional ""connection"" between those locations. Of course the latency is high, but that is acceptable for some uses.

What if a bunch of us got cheap APs with big HDs, put them in our vehicles, and established a system whereby anyone could request bulk data feeds that they're interested in, and then any participating mobile unit could deliver that feed. Perhaps in exchange for a small fee paid in Bitcoin on delivery. Software could figure out based on where data consumers are and where mobile units typically travel, how to hand data around in multiple hops as needed to get it anywhere. 

Large corporations, high schools, universities, bus stops, and airports could become hubs where mobile units would meet constantly to exchange payloads, much like a Fedex sorting facility. Mobile units could even travel through the mail and hand off data as they come within range of other mobile units.

Truckers, bus drivers, commuters, anyone who travels a lot could earn a little extra money just by having a mobile unit in his vehicle or on his person.

It could be built on the standard Usenet protocols, perhaps even allowing conventional usenet software to be used as clients. Lots of additional software would be needed to make it functional of course, the routing algorithms and unit identification/negotiation schemes would take some work to figure out but it's certainly a tractable problem. I suppose you would have a designated wifi ad-hoc SSID to be used. Then when a ""consumer"" sees a mobile unit on that SSID, he would say ""I am interested in the feed xyz and I will pay 0.05 BTC"". Mobile unit would pass this request on to any other mobile units he encounters, or perhaps fulfill the request himself when he ""docks"" at the university/corporation wherever a big pipe is available. When the payload is delivered, mobile unit gets compensated.

An Internet backhaul is not strictly necessary of course, but I think it would be hard to get this off the ground if you didn't have one. So initially, people would use this in conjunction with their ordinary DSL/cable service, where they need to do large file transfers ""out of band"". Of course it might be used for warez but there are many other applications. For example if someone needs a huge upload capacity for video/photography work, or to do off-site backups.

  * OpenSSH
  * htop
  * OpenFire (XMPP)

* Unity
* Games
* Media players/editors
* Office software
* Tomboy

Stuff in the next version (I hope):

* FTP Server
* etherpad
* I2P
* TrueCrypt
* LXDE or KDE, not sure which yet
* radvd (advertises your computer as a router/gateway on a LAN)
* dhcpd (provides other computers with IP addresses with DHCP)

What will probably never come default in CJBuntu, but can be installed by people who want it:

* Desktop software, like GIMP
* Web frameworks like Wordpress

For starters, I'll cover the integration of Project Meshnet &amp; the Seattle Meshnet Project. 

The Seattle Meshnet Project was originally very much a separate organization that had a minor relationship with Project Meshnet, as things have progressed over the past 2 months, both of our organizations are now working closely together on meshmaps, and we currently have a (mostly built) Open Street Maps tile server [here](http://badger.thefinn93.com/) that is available on hyperboria &amp; is going to form part of the backend for meshmaps.

On the topic of cjdns, a fair amount of progress has been made over the past month in updates &amp; added features, although more programmers fluent in C and python are needed to help speed up the development process &amp; people who are interested or have knowledge about routing algorithms are needed to move cjdns out of alpha. To quote cjd ""We really have 2 problems, one is that cjdns is vastly more complex than an algorithm such as BATMAN, the other is that cjdns has had comparatively very little actual research into the (routing) algorithm and how to make it function.""

If you think you can assist the cjdns devs, join their [IRC channel](http://mibbit.com/?channel=%23cjdns&amp;server=irc.efnet.org) &amp; introduce yourself, or post below if you would prefer.

Besides those two topic above, Project Meshnet has  also started building [Meshlocal groups](http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/s058y/starting_meshlocals_getting_involved/), groups of people who want to build the physical network to run cjdns on. In this area we have made significant strides, but one thing that the community as a whole should consider is doing a kickstarter or a donation page to build Meshlocal starter kits, essentially it would be a set of 4 to 6 radios that Project Meshnet could mail off to a new Meshlocal, preconfigured to work with each other &amp; flashed to run OpenWRT + cjdns.

A meshlocal starter kit could look like this:

2 Nanostation M5 radios @ $85ea

2 Nanostation M2 radios @ $85ea

2 Nanostation M5 loco Radios @ $50ea

2 RB250G Gigabit Switches @$40ea

Total: $480

This buys at least 2 to 4 meshlocal nodes, and would also add 6 nodes to cjdns. More importantly, this gives an aspiring meshlocal all of the tools they need to set up a robust network in one neat package, and would help streamline the process of getting started. 

But, moving on there are some developments among the moderator community of this subreddit that Reddit should know in the interest of transparency. I recently became a moderator on this subreddit, shortly before Derp stepped down as a moderator, and as you might have noticed for a short while we reverted back to our default theme, from the Project Meshnet theme. The cause of most of this is due to a combination of Wolfeater being uninvolved in Project Meshnet &amp; making himself uncontactable over the past few months and Derp being an overzealous moderator and taking down Wolfeaters post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/rzp1s/thoughts_on_cispa_and_the_status_and_future_of/).

I'd hope they'd sort it out, and at this point I and the rest of the moderators are attempting to push the two of them to come to an agreement.

Note: The above disclosure is almost assuredly tainted by my own opinions. Also, from what I have seen Derp is a great guy &amp; team member of Project Meshnet, and while he is great at building websites, designing logos and administrating servers, Moderation skills are an area that need to be honed over a long period of time, by going through the learning stages of moderation, whereby you are over &amp; underzealous, and receive backlash for poor moderation. Only after that process can you be a good mod, and learn to back off when a post plays with your emotions &amp; ask another moderator to step in &amp; review said post.

In addition, all data is distributed smoothly across every node with redundancy. I'm very interested in a universal wireless Meshnet, I just have some questions.

I understand that CJDNS allows for networking without any ISPs at all, but how does it hold up against Freenet? FN is extremely high latency due to the random bouncing, can a Meshnet do any better?  How is data stored on the mesh? Is it fast enough to handle streaming data for games and video?

I am an animation and VFX student and have decided to set up a personal project which aims to make a simple yet informative animated guide and introduction to the meshnet project.

The aim of it is not to tell people how to make mesh nets, nor the exact technical detail of what it is, but to merely explain to those without technical skills what it is and the basic mechanics of such a system, all the while getting them interested and providing them with a dirction to go to find out more.

this is a basic [animatic of the introduction](http://vimeo.com/37788931) i knocked up over two nights between assessments, which shows the visual style i want to go for. I am aware of the bad timing and such, this is just an animatic.

To do this animation, (which will take a while) I will need to write a good clean and simple script that explains what I want to get across to the audience. I will peruse the sidebar and other resources, but any and all input/criticism is welcome and encouraged.

I'll be posting semi-regular updates as progress is made (between assessments so progress will be slow)

So yes, input/criticism/advice, hit me.

EDIT: typos and grammatical fuck-ups fixed, also this:

After an acceptable nights sleep, I've decided the script should be divided into three parts:

What is the meshnet?
This section will also cover the why of the meshnet, citing SOPA, PIPA and ACTA to help explain why people thought this was a necessary step for online freedom.

How does it work?
This section will explain the basic mechanics, without getting into specifics, using nice visuals to aid the viewers understanding. Nodes, peer to peer wifi etc etc. Sadly I don't have an especially good understanding of it myself, so much research is needed here.

Where can I find out more?
This quick little final section will guide people to various websites about the meshnet (reddit included) and other similar projects (the pirate box and meshnet alternatives for example)


The script will be narrated over the top with the visuals helping them, and sadly will probably be read by me, but in my mind I hear Stephen Fry narrating it all in the manner of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.....sigh, a man can dream.

Anyway, this is a rough layout of the script, and I don't think its perfect, so any ideas on improving it are greatly encouraged, as I dont think the ""Where can I find out more?"" section is very fitting with the others, but is necessary in one form or another.

Which got me wondering, which distros/other OS's have this preinstalled, and what are the security implications of this, from both a pragmatic and paranoid point of view? And what better way to find out than a proper reddit post.

So, basically two things going on here. One, post your distro and whether or not it has the cert installed\*, if you don't see it listed already. I'll try to compile a list in the body of the post.

Secondly, security experts: how much should we worry about having the cert installed on our systems?

\* You can do this by running `ls /etc/ssl/certs | grep CN` on Linux, and possibly other \*NIX systems like OS X. I don't know how you'd check on Windows.

 * **KUBUNTU:** Has cert. (ProtoDong)
 * **DEBIAN STABLE:** Does not have cert. (rainfly_x)
 * **MINT 13:** Has cert. (thefinn93)

 * **OS X:** Has cert. (rprebel)
 * **WINDOWS 8:** Does not have cert. (Mike12344321)

**Further update: Firefox is wearing a black hat today**

Firefox includes CNNIC trusted root by default. That's really bad. But fixable, you can go through the preferences and set it to ""untrusted"" so that all your browsers will distrust it. From the discussion below, I'm disappointed in Firefox and confident that setting CNNIC to untrusted is the right thing to do.

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=542689

**Update after that: Chrome is too**

This is definitely shaping up to be a problem with certificates that get packaged with the browser, and I suspect most browsers do trust CNNIC. That's a problem. If you ever plan to visit China, make sure you disable the CNNIC cert. Deleting it may not be enough (some browsers restore missing certificates on launch), mark disabled so your browser remembers that the cert is blacklisted. Instructions for this are browser-specific and easy to google.

I don't think this is a security threat outside the Great Firewall of China, as your browser will use other certs where available.

&gt; The people who have developed these proposals are unfortunately limited in
their thinking. ISPs are unable to see past the now almost 30 year old routing
protocols which glue together the internet of today. Government actors are
conditioned to think of something as secure when they have control over it.
A quick look at x509 (the authentication system behind SSL) shows us that
central points of failure inevitably live up to their name. In order to have a
central authority, the people must not only be able to trust his motives but
they must be able to trust his system's integrity as well. Recently people's
e-mail was compromised when DigiNotar certificate authority was hacked and used
to forge gmail certificates.

&gt; It is worthy of note that the vulnerability in DNS which ICE exploited to take
down websites they deemed ""dedicated to copyright infringement"" was also used
by Anonymous to replace a movie industry website with a manifesto.

&gt; \*A System Is Only Secure When Nobody Has Total Control*

As stated in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/my4zg/what_does_the_darknetplan_do_against_censorship/), Freenet shares many common goals with Meshnet - censorship resistance, anonymity, distributed resources. It offers features that are exactly what Meshnet proponents have said [they would like to see](http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/mut6a/what_basic_functions_would_you_like_to_see_from/) in early versions. The area in which Freenet differs is that it still uses the established internet pipelines as its infrastructure.  

So what if we tweaked Freenet to run over a Meshnet? I think we'd have have the best of both worlds with much less work on the programming side. Our limited technical resources wouldn't have to reinvent the wheel for every text message / IRC / bulletin board. We would be using our almost unanimous philosophy on hardware issues, ""use whatever already exists and works"", and applying it on the programming side. We would still be in control of the hardware, and we would still be taking censorship-resistant technology to the next level.

Naysayers will say that it is very unlikely that anyone will be in range, but it does not matter as it is only a beginning.  That's why we need a persistent map.  The number of people will grow and the people who *are* in range will be able to begin a mesh network.  The network won't immediately be useful except for experimenting, but slowly connections will increase as interest picks up.

1324480846.0,36,self.darknetplan,nlb4q,On Meshnet and Ham Radio (and radio in general),42,6,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/nlb4q/on_meshnet_and_ham_radio_and_radio_in_general/,"There seem to be a lot of suggestions of utilizing amateur radio frequencies and equipment to overcome some of the issues that the meshnet project desires to resolve.  I wanted to post some thoughts on this ideas in the hopes that I might be able to clear up some misconceptions.

I've been a licensed amateur radio operator for almost 18 years and have experience in most of the bands available on HF, VHF, and UHF as well as many of the digital modes available to them.  IANAL, but I am familiar with some of the laws that are discussed in this subreddit as well.

First, I think /r/darknetplan has two clear -- but two very different -- goals that it wishes to achieve:  1) the ability to communicate if the internet were to be shut off by some entity and  2) to bypass censorship imposed on the internet.  Ham radio is only useful for one of these things.

What you can do with ham radio:  You can experiment with the hobby and the design and making of communications circuits, talk to people locally or anywhere in the world, enjoy casual conversation from the comfort of home, volunteer to support outdoor events by providing communications, assist with communications efforts in disasters when other forms are not available, and enjoy any number of other challenging and fun facets of the hobby.

What you *cannot* do with ham radio:

* Expect to send encrypted, encoded, or obscured information.

Planning to send encrypted text via a digital mode?  Send a binary file that is protected with a password?  Say ""the crow sleeps at midnight"" on the air with the knowledge that the receiving station knows this means you plan to meet them at the bar for lunch?  None of this is legal.  Anything you send over the air needs to be in the clear and *understood by anyone listening in that has knowledge and the equipment of the accepted mode of communication*.  There are some that think there might be loopholes around this, but it needs to be understood that there is an accepted general practice that takes place on the air.  Exchanges that deviate from this would not only stick out extremely easily, but would be quickly reported by the community.  It just isn't accepted to do this.

* Expect to send large amounts of data to a wide area.

Yes, you can use ham radio to communicate with people all over the world.  This is primarily done with the lower (HF) frequencies.  The lower the frequency, the less data can be sent in a given amount of time.  People who are used to near instantaneous speed of today's networks are usually appalled by the data rates on the HF bands.  PSK31 and RTTY45?  The numbers associated with these modes are the *baud rate*.  Yes, nearly everyone types faster than these modes can send.

As you get to VHF and UHF frequencies, you can send more data -- woo, 1200 baud for packet radio!  In simple terms, though, the coverage of the upper bands is dramatically decreased.  The higher you go in frequency, the more line-of-sight communications are.  Higher frequencies do not penetrate through walls as easily, are reflected, and above UHF you get to the point where the antennas have to be highly directional and must be in visible sight of each other to cover any real distance.

* Expect  communications to be reliable.

The reason so many hams enjoy the hobby is the unpredictable nature of the beast.  HF, specifically, is affected by things like the time of day, sunspot cycle, atmospheric and weather conditions, and other unpredictable features.  Ionospheric skip (the method by which HF signals bounces off the upper levels of the atmosphere and make long distance communication possible) means I might be able to have a conversation easily with someone in Europe but not be readable by a friend just 70 miles away.  It also means that the clear conversation I am having with that station in Europe will suddenly end as conditions change from one minute to the next.

Frequencies above HF do not propagate through skip, but the reliability is much higher.  I can expect, on any given day and time, to use 50 watts of power on 146MHz to talk to a friend the next town over, no matter day or night, sunspots, etc.  But I'll likely never get beyond that range unless through great luck of tropospheric ducting.

* Expect communication to be easy.

HF antennas can be easily made at home and very cheap, but they also tend to be very large.  My antennas for the HF bands that are active in the daytime is 33 feet in total length and stretches from one side of my back yard to the other.  The lower bands can have antennas that are 40 meters in length or longer.  There are more compact antennas, but they are much more difficult to make, tune, use, and successfully utilize.

Again, VHF and UHF are short distance line of sight communications.  The antennas are much more compact, but height is an issue.

There are networks of relay stations for digital communications, but they're not sending anything more than short, simple text messages.

So, anyways, I've rambled on long enough.

If short, if your desire is to be able to communicate with the others if all other forms of communication are inaccessible, then investigate getting an amateur radio license and entering the hobby.  Do not expect it to be easy, cheap, fast, or reliable.  Drop by /r/amateurradio -- we're friendly, helpful, and would love to assist you with it!  If your desire is to circumvent imposed censorship, it is my opinion that you should *exclude radio except for consumer wifi and wifi bridging entirely from your plans*.  Your desire to collect images, audio, video, or pages of information over a distributed network composed of communication gear not already intended for such service is simply not a possibility.  You're not going to connect neighborhoods of people for data with gear that isn't already able to do just that and you're certainly not going to interconnect cities, towns, states, etc, this way.  The throughput, spectrum, and reliability is not there.

You have at your fingertips on the very device you are using right now amazing encryption and network abilities.

I know the idea of darknetplan is to make a brand new network outside of the internet without regulation, but why not use tor hidden services?

For those who don't know, tor has hidden services.  They are servers which can only be accessed via tor.  They are impossible to locate, and all traffic to them is encrypted.  They can host anything, from a chat server, email server, minecraft server, or a web page.  The way traffic in tor works is completely different from how tcp/ip works, in the sense that the traits which make it vulnerable to inspection by routers between the source an destination is removed.  Read up at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion

Lets look back to how the internet first started being set up.  There were a few small networks in different government buildings and schools that connected together using existing infrastructure (perhaps phone wires).  After this network was established using existing infrastructure (IP over modem over phoneline) it was expanded ontop of that scaffolding to be what we all enjoy today.

So, the goal of darknetplan is to make a new network which is resistant to censorship.  There should only be one network and it should spread everywhere because that keeps speech open and global.

We already have this.  It's called tor.  Tor removes the need for DNS servers, signing authorities, ip address delegation, and every other problem with making the existing internet ad-hoc.  Just think of tor as a network within a network (like how a virtual machine works on a computer - a computer in a computer).

The fact that tor exists within the internet is purely out of convenience that the internet exists and is available to facilitate these encrypted links.  In that sense, tor is using the internet as a backbone, like the internet started using phone lines as a backbone.  Tor could be deployed other places, like on a mesh network, over connections on modems, over adhoc wifi connections, or any other communication medium.  As long as at least one tor node in the network connects back to the internet (as a backbone), or whatever other popular home for tor is that is not the internet, then you're on tor.

So, basically, you can access tor regardless of how you are accessing the tor node (you could access it via a private mesh network) as long as the creator of the network you're using made sure to include access to tor in it.

See where I am going with this?  Why don't we all start our own individual projects to deploy tor to odd places, and expand the coverage tor has outside of the internet.  We can use tor as the fundamental technology that allows our darknet to work.  I could start setting up access points that only access servers within tor (no access to the internet) and then start setting up servers on tor (it doesn't matter where these servers live anymore).

In conclusion, if the plan was 'make a darknet that nobody can control as soon as possible', then I think the logical answer is to all individually start tinkering with and getting creative with tor, rather than wait for some central authority to make this magical darknetplan network for us.",,False,self,t5_2rju2,True,,,True,t3_m1tw4,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/m1tw4/why_not_tor_as_a_backbone/,

Now, I'm well aware there are many people in this subreddit who are better at the technical details than I am, so I am simply going to put out the goals and some basic ideas to get us started, then if you know what you're doing feel free to chime in.

So first are the goals of the ""Phase 1"" Darknet, which will be established over current internet connections:

*  As Decentralized as possible. It should not rely on single computers to keep the whole network up.

*  Encryption. It should be extremely difficult for individual users to be tracked down.


*  Usability. If this system is not usable, it will not grow to non-technical users. This means we must balance speed and security well enough for the average person.


* Finally it must be well planned. If we are not careful it could end up a kitty porn (in both senses of the term) haven and that would ruin the entire project. We want to allow free speech, but we should start by making sure we focus on getting the right kind of people in first to establish a solid community.

My thoughts on how to accomplish from a technical standpoint are simple (most likely way too simple). We will want to use existing technology, but create a new network that combines everything we will need. Tor will not work in this respect. The goal is to have a network that at least begins to reach these goals up in a few days/a couple of weeks. We will begin organization through IRC tomorrow. I will create a channel and post it here. Until then, post ideas, comments, criticisms, etc here on this thread. Good night and good luck.

Because of this subreddit's goal to ultimately be off the grid, I thought this would be an appropriate place to ask.

Assuming various pieces fall into place properly, I may be able to attach a payload to a high altitude balloon. The group typically will be able to get their balloons up to 100k feet. At this point though I'm just letting some thoughts that have been floating in my head run wild.

The dilemma though is the data link. There are various methods available (like 1200 or 9600 baud AFSK links), but my goal is to be able to downlink pictures from the balloon as it's flying. It will most likely have a Rebel XT or an SX100-series Canon camera connected to a Raspberry Pi (or using an Eye-Fi card - not sure yet). 

In previous launches, HSMM-MESH networks have been attempted, and ultimately failed to succeed.

BBSes were like little websites made entirely out of ANSI characters (basically just colored text). Some of them still exist over telnet and sometimes SSH, and a few of them can still be dialed into using an old modem. 1200bps is fast enough for something like that.

What I was thinking about is an utterly basic system to get things off the ground, something you could hack together in an afternoon that'll work on even the most limited of connections, from any point on the planet. What about a 140 character SMS style communications system? I'm not talking about twitter here, but a robust, distributed multipath routing and transport system for short messages. You could use amateur low orbit satellites for pickup from any point on the planet, with steganographic transport over the internet, and a mechanism for indicating that the message has been received, maybe even systems for routing messages on USB sticks, dot patterns on paper, grid codes that you could print on a T shirt, wear to a protest, and would be picked up automatically by software that scanned news reports.

OK, some of the stuff towards the end might all sound complex (maybe even a bit fanciful), but it's how things might grow from a small, simple idea, which is how the internet started in the first place. I don't think it's desirable to try and create another uncensored internet by duplicating all of the services we have on the net, but rather to create the fresh new seed of something that might grow into an uncensored internet, and without the drag factor and overhead of historical protocols and data formats.

Right, I've been frequenting this subreddit for 5 or 6 months now, and I've always been troubled by the direction we are moving in.

The current theme across structural posts in this subreddit is based around radio communication using some form of DIY hardware solution to create a new physical network.

This approach certainly has its merits, however its *hard*. I estimate only a handful of people in this community have the skills needed to produce a working model. While it is entirely possible, we seem to be fairly far from reaching the point where this is turned into a reality.

Now, while that is all well and good... I'm a little puzzled. The goal of the meshnet is to produce a truly free network (probably decentralized) in order to escape from tyrannical control by governments around the world - for whatever purpose.

Maybe I'm missing the point. Whoever said it had to be a new physical-layer?

**My question is this**: Why are we dedicating our efforts to produce an entirely new physical-layer network, when there is perfectly good existing global network infrastructure?

I am of course talking about tunnelling over the internet, at OSI levels 2 or 3 (Network layer or transport layer).

**Why not create a large decentralized network (a VPN, essentially) using existing software and exploit the highly sophisticated physical-layer network we already have at our disposal, instead of trying to start fresh??**

I have [posted in the past regarding n2n](http://www.ntop.org/n2n/), an encrypted OSI layer 2 peer-to-peer VPN, and received little response (The subreddit was quite small at that point).

Now, I'm not saying n2n is the perfect solution - on the contrary, a friendly fellow Redditor pointed out that [tinc](http://tinc-vpn.org/) may actually be more appropriate. Regardless, it was just casual ideas.

Don't think of this as a rant - it's not. I am just suggesting we take a look at simpler alternatives before we try and create a world-changing new network.

**SO, people of /r/darknetplan - I look forward to hearing your input! :D**

ps, I'm fairly poor with Reddit markdown - expect minor changes and formatting to this post over the next minutes...

So, I wanted to create a thread where these issues can be aggregated and people can discuss potential fixes.  As we go on, I can create more subcategories and whatnot to make the list easier to read.




Hardware Issues
----------------



Software Issues
----------------
1) How to handle routing while (hopefully) maintaining anonymity


2) Scaling across rural areas.
    - A short-term fix that has been suggested would be to use existing internet infrastructure and secure VPNs, but this of course is not an ideal long-term solution.  


3) What layers of the network model would the meshnet sit on?  Obviously the hardware level, but would meshnet be implementing its own protocols or would it use existing ones and just be the underlying levels?  What about the application layer - should meshnet be transparent to applications or will it require dedicated meshnet applications?


4) Will servers have reassigned IP addresses like hosts will?  If so, how will DNS take place?  A possible solution would be to route near to the server via geographical location and then zero in by using other nodes as DNS resolution servers.


PR Issues
----------


1) The website - if we want to appeal to more than hackers and techies, we need a professional website with the project's mission statement and current progress clearly laid out.

I'm curious how would be best to host a site like this? Local hosting makes sense because the site is useful in the absence of a wider net, but is it a reasonable expectation for local meshes to be *capable* of hosting the site? Would it get built in to or be a plugin of sorts for whatever magic box people are using to connect to the mesh?

Cloud hosting makes sense too, or at least cloud replication of the local site. Security keeps access limited to local users, but the neighborhood could have a global profile for sharing bigger events or simply reporting up/down status.

What does this allow you to do? Well for example for TOR like functionality you would issue a connect() call with several VSL hosts as arguments. This connect call will then ""route"" the connection through these virtual hosts. It also now allows you to issue a remote listen call (which makes creating services like tor hidden services a whole lot easier) - the remote listen listens on a remote node for incoming connections and you can then just call ""accept()"" on the socket periodically to get a virtual socket for the remote connection. The remote host does not know your real IP only the node IP. On top of this you can easily implement tor-like functionality, hidden services and virtually any protocol. 

Best thing: library exposes a standard sockets interface - which means you can call socket(), connect(), accept() and listen() just like you would normally do. The library uses UDP for all data transfers (with reliability control implemented on top of that) which allows for fully rendezvous connections. And the library is free as in GPL :)

The code you will find here: 
git clone https://github.com/martinvolk/GlobalNet.git

Unfortunately I have not had time to finish the library all the way to 100%. Something that needs to be implemented is fully rendezvous connections (where two hosts call connect at the same time and none of them listens - which makes it possible to connect through firewalls). Also, ssl certificates need to be generated for each new connection so that we are not using the same certifficate for all of them :). Both are relatively minor things that just need to be put in there and tested - all the underlying functionality is already there so the wires just need to be connected so to speak..

If you have issues read the whole thing.

*If you know your way around a linux system, this is *not* for you. You should read the [README](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/README.md) and install it the proper way.*

A few days ago, [this video](http://youtu.be/GVaBPjObvrU) got posted with tons of upvotes (and added a ton of nodes, [as seen here](https://twitter.com/meshnetupdates)). It had some issues and some bugs, such as requiring you to leave the terminal window open, but was generally pretty good. Anyway, [TrueShiftBlue](/u/TrueShiftBlue) did a lot of work on it, with help from the [original author](/u/productiveacct) and myself, and now we have another version out. The changelog is as follows:

* Integration with [thefinn93](/u/thefinn93-notbanned)'s service script and HypeDNS script
* Now automatically starts on system boot, upgrading if necessary
* Prompts the user for peer info, providing some public peers as defaults (runs in a separate thread while things are compiling)
* Automatic configuration file editing via sed now much less fragile (no longer relies on being laid out for specific line numbers to delete extraneous braces)
* Downloads additional files as needed from https://www.thefinn93.com , rather than being bound to a specific ip. Note that it'll only download the files if they're not already present. You can download and inspect the scripts beforehand (put hypedns.py in a cjdns repository in /opt/cjdns/hypedns.py and initd.sh in /etc/init.d/hyperboria) if you want to.
* Rotates preset peers from a growing list (currently 15 peers, but that could go up). This actually applies to the last one as well, as they were downloaded from a server and we threw up a script to do that. The three preset peers initially saw a [massive increase in bandwidth usage](http://imgur.com/YJza7). The script still gives out three peers (the recommended number), just not the same three every time. If you'd like to contribute peering details to this list, message me or hit me up on IRC.

Note that while this script is improved, it's still in beta. We haven't tested it in a ton of environments and you'll probably get issues. It depends on some Ubuntu specific stuff (Debian or Mint might work, but beyond that you're pushing it and should really just install cjdns ""the hard way""). We are, however, interested in getting it to work for you. If you have issues and want to get connected, come [chat with us](http://chat.efnet.org:9090/?channels=%23projectmeshnet&amp;nick=redditor..). It's ok if you think your question is dumb, I sit on that channel all day and answer ""dumb"" questions. If you can type on a keyboard we'll probably be able and willing to help. There will probably be someone on 24/7, thanks to us all being scattered across the globe. If you don't get a response right away just let it sit there. You can even go into another window, that chat will beep at you when someone says your name. This will probably not be the last update, we're looking into options for an auto-updating script. That may or may not show up in a few days. If you want to be notified of that, PM me.

One other thing I've noticed: Chrome needs to be restarted after running cjdns before it will connect. A lot of Chrome users, myself included, got really confused by this.

One of the things that I've believed pretty strongly about mesh software is that it's best packaged and easily installable, to the point that an entire system could be built with [debootstrap](http://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap) in a consistent and predictable manner. Unfortunately, the limits of packaging (and the inconveniences), such as lack of a common packaging system, leave a lot to be desired.

*However!*

When I was looking into Puppet today as a potential solution for some of the more convoluted aspects of server administration, I realized just how flexible and awesome the concept of a manifest file is. Puppet is very cross-platform, manifest files are easy to maintain on Github (to the point where you can put them on Gist, or for security, off of Github entirely with ezcrypt.it), and the barrier to entry in terms of creating and maintaining them is much lower than with packages. There's also more stuff you can do with them, or at least more easily.

The problem, so far as I've seen it, has been choice of solution. Obviously I'm already a little bit familiar with Puppet, and I've heard Chef name-dropped. But I haven't actually worked with either one, and Puppet looks like it might have corporate licensing issues. So I'd like to propose the question to the big and wonderful /r/darknetplan crowd: Puppet, Chef, or take a third option entirely?

I'd love to see us have a standard cross-platform format for configuration manifests, it would be really useful for distributing and applying settings both in a local physical network, and across the globe. Strictly speaking it's certainly not a dealbreaker if there's no unanimous decision, plenty of meshnet efforts are working without this kind of tech being used at all.

====================================================
## WIRELESS BATTLE OF THE MESH SEEKING FOR ENDORSEMENTS
====================================================


The Battlemesh community is seeking for endorsements from well known
communities in the field of Community Networks, Open Routing Protocols,
Open Source Software and Hacktivism.
Endorsement is just a fancy word that means to promote the event and
attract the maximum number of people as possible to the event.


========================
## What Does Endorsing Mean
========================


Endorsing means to publish an official press release (link to the press
release template here) on your website which will express your
community's support to the event and indicate any eventual involvement
of your community in the event.
For example, some people of your community might come to the event; some
others might be the organizers; some others will hold one or more talks
and so on.


Additionally but not obbligatorily, your community could also donate
hardware or money to the event.


All the communities endorsing the battlemesh v6 will be listed on the
[Endorsers 2013 page](http://battlemesh.org/Endorsements2013) of our
website with their logos, a short description of what they do and their
level of involvement with the event.


=====================
## Why Endorsing is Good
=====================


The interest in the event will surely grow if potential participants can
see many communities and skilled individuals are actively involved.


Our goals are:


* spread the word
* let potential attendants see who is coming
* have a poster with all the logos of the endorsers
* have a page with a list of the endorsers


==============
## How to Endorse
==============


* Copy the following [endorsement template](http://battlemesh.org/EndorsementTemplate) and modify it according to
your preferences
* Send a mail with the logo (300dpi transparent background in svg or eps format) and the description (bio, website link, social networking accounts) of your community to battlemesh AT ml DOT ninux DOT org
* Publish the press release on your website/blog
* Spread it with all the means you can: mailing list, social networks, etc.

I've been slowly mapping my local city, and was stunned with the sheer number of wireless networks.  I live in a small community (~60,000 people), and just in my little corned of it, I've found over 4000 wireless networks.

The app lets me map all the wireless networks with .kml files, which shows an impressive overlapping of wireless networks.  In this dense environment it may not be necessary to use point-to-point bridges with directional technology to facilitate communication with a meshnet system, if an appropriate Access Point Operating System existed to connect all the networks together.

I'm a web application developer by trade, and as such, usually build to the highest common denominator in web browsers, and work backwards from there.  Today that means I develop my apps to function on a Internet Explorer browser then work down to Firefox, Opera, etc.  From the MeshNet concept I would want to be able to identify the largest number of deployed access points by hardware make/model so that I could find/write an OS that ran on that device with just a firmware update.

I wasn't able to get WigleWifi to tell me what types of routers they were, though it did provide a MAC address.  I know many routers allow cloning/modifying the MAC address of the router, so I don't think it would be a reliable way of determining the type/make/model of the routers in question.  Does such a piece of software exist?

Does my description make sense? Has anyone tackled this problem from this stand point?

On the same genre, has anyone tried to do this with Android?  Could android be setup to wirelessly hop from AP to AP like it does on the cellphone network?  Could it be possible to use my android phone in conjuction with a VOIP software to make calls while I walk down the road?  With the end goal of breaking the grip of the cellphone companies on us.

I've seen others have recommended funding this through Kickstarter, though it doesn't look like it has progressed at all.  What is the thinking here, why hasn't it been pursued?

Has anyone connected with their local governments to try solicit help in deploying this technology?

The wiki says that cjdns is still in its alpha stages and is very unstable. Is there a time table for a stable release? when that is finished, how long will it take to get a windows port to get mainstream participation?

I have not seen any consensus on hardware yet. I saw the statement on the wiki regarding openwrt routers, but I was unable to make inferences about cost vs performance. What is the range and bandwidth on a typical router? What kind of obstructions would our routers be able to withstand?

I saw the hyperboria site and noticed that only 42 nodes out of a few hundred known nodes were online. If we cannot build momentum, we cannot get the public on board. The previous two paragraphs contain issues that must be addressed before the mainstream can get involved.

This project has 27000 subscribers at this moment, but our posts are not forming a coherent plan of action. when cjdns was declared to be our software and hyperboria became our network, it looked as if the system would make more (visible) progress, but the subreddit looks stagnated. I imagine there is progress that I am not seeing, but for a project of this magnitude to work we need to have a working system that anyone can use and benefit from. I have a feeling that the websites hosted inside of hyperboria will not be as appealing for people who already have the regular internet. This leads me to my idea to attract more users.

Hyperboria's sales pitch should be DIY UNLIMITED FREE INTERNET. I am not a programmer, but if we could configure nodes to portal into the regular internet via public wifi that is either setup for charity or from the local coffee shop, the result would be free internet for everyone that sets up a node. The routers will have to distribute the load so that those networks don't get flooded and get us barred from bumming off of public networks. The network would also be wise to direct as much torrent traffic through itself as if it were a lan. That way less bandwidth would be consumed from the network that is providing our gateway. In large cities this will be easier to do, so they will have faster access. Things will slow down and latency will get worse as people get further away from nodes that have direct access to the internet. Would this work? How bad would the latency get? How well would this concept scale up to an entire continent? If I'm misled then please tell me so others don't repeat my crazy ideas.

I live in a pretty rural neighborhood in Texas. When I first moved here in 2004 I was able to get pretty good internet service over cell signal from a local Telecom. Over the next few years the company ditched the program because the tower kept going down and there wasn't enough support from the neighborhood to keep it going. Ever since then everyone has either had to use pricy and subpar Satellite or 3G dongles in every computer. The way that this land is zoned its against the law to wire internet here. The good news is we have a fiber optic drop ending right at our gate. The entire community only spans around five miles. I've been looking around and it seems like [Ubiquiti's](http://www.ubnt.com) product are going to be the best bet to get a neighborhood wide network going. The biggest problem is the initial internet connection. How should we go about accessing that fiber optic drop? We do own land within the service area but the highest speed is around 10mbps and ATTs TOS restricts sharing a connection, so even going against the TOS there's definitely not enough bandwidth to support the whole neighborhood. Any help would be awesome!

While a device may remain in range of a single wifi signal at 80mph long enough to make a request and get back a small amount of info (assuming no time to connect and setup first, very optimistic) if other devices can not continental to route to the moving one it is effectively offline.

so I was pleased to see the top link is to the recent Chronicle article. I wrote a comment there, [Fear of Repression Spurs Scholars and Activists to Build Alternate Internets](http://chronicle.com/article/Fear-of-Repression-Spurs/129049/?sid=wc&amp;utm_source=wc&amp;utm_medium=en#comment-323065169) but i think its on topic enough to repeat in its entirety here.

---begin self copypasta---

What is needed is a device with the ubiquitous geographic distribution of modern router hardware, but with an ad-hoc mesh topology, preferably operating in its own address space separate from the existing internet - say an ipv6 subnet - and with built in ""social networking"" functionality to mediate communication and access to shared resources to and with neighboring nodes.

Something like an internet CB radio. =)

Its certainly becoming more obvious to everyone the potential benefits of creating a free and open network where one connects to ones nearest neighbors in a mesh oriented topology.

It is strange that it has taken so long for this to become apparent. It points to an overall paradigm shift in the architecture of contemporary wireless networking. 

All network architectures in common use thus far promote connectivity that is tethered to the infrastructure in a center-margin paradigm. The infrastructure owners are the center, and the users occupy the margin. There is no paradigm for direct connectivity between marginal node users whatsoever except back through the infrastructure.

Yet from an engineering perspective, the hardware itself is lacking no capability to support a full reconfiguration of the networking paradigm towards a mesh architecture. Perhaps the perception of possible threats, amplified by media reinforcement has led to heavy handed and ultimately lopsided security model of NAT and firewalling in router software. 

I call it lopsided because it has prevented the equally important perception of the potential for connectivity between adjacent nodes. With so many routers already deployed in close proximity to each other, the WLAN architecture is itself still reflective of the center-margin tethered-to-the-infrastructure paradigm. The architecture and functionality could just as easily exist to support an automatic and intrinsic meshing of all neighboring WLAN island hubs (routers), assigning unique but dynamic addresses to all leaf nodes, and providing an  interface for various kinds of information exchange between them: File sharing. LAN Gaming. Instant messaging. Mail messaging. Forums. Blog or homepage for each ""node"" similar to a facebook or google+ ""wall"".

One moves into a new apartment or neighborhood and one ""joins the mesh"" and meets their geographical neighbors in mesh space. 

The main idea is that this net network should not be promoted as a connection to the existing internet, but rather touted as a new and entirely separate network. 

While some implementation challenges still remain particularly with NAT, Ipv6 would appear to have a large enough address space to allow the entirety of devices on the new mesh network to all coexist within a single private ipv6 subnet. Protocols and mechanisms such as dhcpv6, NDP and SNDP already exist to facilitate the ad-hoc assignment of addresses in this address space.

One reason for the need for such a network to exist in its own address space is the shortage of available addresses and subnets remaining in ipv4. Another reason is to promote the idea this is a ubiquitous network separate from the existing internet. Given appropriate encryption and certificate based authentication there is no reason users could not utilize the mesh infrastructure to establish a connection back to the public internet, but that is not its primary purpose. 

Its purpose is the creation of a new, separate address space and namespace that is ultimately community moderated instead of top-down moderated by the infrastructure owners. 

Thus the architecture shifts from being infrastructure-centric, center margin, tethered to the infrastructure style paradigm, to a truly device-centric paradigm.

As far as the naming of nodes and the namespace architecture of the new mesh network, the new mesh network should have its own system of domain authorities and registrars, which would all exist as a subdomain of a single TLD in the public internet. Some nodes might choose to exist only on the mesh network and thus not need to use the public internet TLD, but anyone using both the new mesh and the public internet from the same device or within the same network would definitely use the new TLD.

As for the assignment of domain names within the new namespace, one could craft a dual naming scheme similar to the usenet newsgroup hierarchies: Big 7 and Alt, each of which could be its own TLD within the new network.

Assuming the new network exists in its own private ipv6 subnet and using something like NDP or SNDP for dynamic allotment of address, certificate based authentication could be used to create a flexible mapping between certificate, device MAC, local mesh address, and a name within a fixed domain hierarchy perhaps geographically oriented in nature and maintained regionally and locally by committees. This would resemble Big 7. Such a mapping if properly executed could even allow for the existence of mobile nodes and allow for a kind of roaming, especially locally. Meanwhile another hierarchy could exist with a separate TLD models on the ""alt"" hierarchy, allowing for a first come first serve dynamic naming of nodes with minimal or no certificate authentication.

As for the underlying topology of the network at the level of addressing ( as opposed to the level of naming ) this appears to be an area of ongoing research. The wikipedia articles Wireless_Mesh_Network and Ad_hoc_routing_protocol_list provide some clues of the challenges and possible implementations at this level of the architecture. Existing software implementations should be leveraged to get such a network going ASAP, such as olsrd or project kleinrock.

All of this might seem like a lot of work, and no doubt it has taken decades of concerted effort and agreement to hash out the protocols and mechanisms by which the existing internet functions.

Old timers might recall the transition from bang-path style email addressing to the modern domain based addressing. This creation of this new network presents some similar challenges, both on the technical side as well as basic architectural assumptions of the networking paradigm itself.

But on the other hand, isn't this all remarkably similar to what's been promised for the coming ""internet of devices"" that one will occasionally hear mentioned in the mainstream media? Surely the development of device-centric, infrastructure-less mesh style networking paradigms is as inherently a prerequisite of the ""internet of devices"" as it is of a free public citizens oriented mesh network.

So hopefully whatever work is done in this new field is not seen as divisive or subversive but rather as the logical next step in the evolution of a truly digitally internetworked information age society.

---end self-copypasta---

Of course I think my ideas are fairly relevant to the ongoing development of the new mesh networking paradigm. But I'd be just as happy to see any of the ideas I present there get utilized as I would be to see them logically debated and ripped to shreds if it helps move things towards the development of a new mesh topology public network. 

Hopefully before the end of 2012 there will be something like a dd-wrt or openwrt router firmware incorporating this new idea of mesh networking. =) ",,False,self,t5_2rju2,True,,,True,t3_kvhvv,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/kvhvv/the_new_mesh_networking_paradigm/,

Now, before anyone assumes that I'm bashing the project's critics, I'd like to say that nothing could be further from the truth. I have no problem with honest, straightforward criticism that helps this project develop a working meshnet system that is within the current laws. (I say ""within the current laws"" because God only knows what the future will hold with regard to the legality of meshnets.)

If you're the kind of person who's coming here to say that ""X is infeasible because Y, here's my evidence, why not consider Z instead?"", that's just fine. That's the kind of thing this project needs: people with the knowledge to make it work.

My problem is with the people who are trying to *disrupt* the project. 

Maybe they're old hands at networking, and they assume that newcomers to the project are a bunch of YouTubing, Facebooking, Twittering, MW3-playing twelve-year-olds who think that the MeshNet Project's purpose is to provide them with their own personal WLAN so they can have all-night frag fests.

Maybe they're trolls who think that they can claim to be ""network engineers"" and people will listen to them when they throw around fancy graphs and say ""MESHNETS ARE ILLEGAL AND THE FCC WILL SEND MEN WITH GUNS TO YOUR HOUSE IF YOU BUILD ONE!""

Maybe, just maybe, they're government agents who see the threat that the MeshNet Project poses to their control and they want to see it crash and burn as soon as possible. (That's probably not the case, and I'm probably going to get people telling me to take off my tinfoil hat, but still.)

The truth is, I don't give a damn about any of their *reasons* for trying to disrupt the project. The problem is that they *are* trying to disrupt the project - and frankly, I'm starting to get a little bit sick of it.

I want to see a working meshnet system in operation - hell, I want to be able to build my own meshnet system for the town I live in, preferably without breaking the bank.

It'd be great if the MeshNet Project was able to create a mesh-based system that connects the entire world the way the Internet currently does, though that's probably a distant dream.

However, I doubt very much that anything good is going to come of this project if we let toxic attitudes drag it down before it's able to do any good.

While I think shutting down MAE-East is unlikely, it does point out that despite the software's ability to route around failures, it ultimately depends on hardware, and that hardware is clustered in a few physical points of presence.

Being the older Redditor and software guy that I am (I watched an [IMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_Message_Processor) get installed one time..), I think it might be necessary to drop back in technology level.  Back to an earlier age, when digital communications meant hearing [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0)

Before always-connected internet, there was [FidoNet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet) which linked bulletin board systems around the world.  You would dialup your local BBS, and compose and send a message to your friend who lived across the country.  Several times a day, the BBS system would upload a message bundle to another BBS, which would then split the bundle up into new bundles, and route them closer to the destination.  This was nice, because long-distance calls were expensive back then, and breaking it up into smaller hops kept it affordable for everyone.

FidoNet had some weaknesses, though:  
* The nodelist tables got to be large (because every node had to be listed), and were almost always out of date as nodes joined &amp; dropped from the network.  
* Messages were not encrypted, so there was lots of eavesdropping  
* Messages were not authenticated, so you never were really sure who the sender was  
* There was no end-to-end reliability.  If a message was dropped.. eh, so what?  

All these problems are solvable with todays newer technology, knowledge, and computing horse-power.

Implications of adopting this system?  
* Communications become a store-and-forward experience.  No streaming live video, instead you watch video which someone has prepared, compressed, encrypted, and sent to you.  
* There is a dependence on the POTS telephone system.  As a lot of backup systems run by the authorities depend on it, so shutting it down is likely to be the last thing they would want to do.
* Many laptops no longer come with modem ports

Is this something that would be interesting to talk about to the members here?

This subreddit knows this better than anyone I'm sure.

As a result I'm starting a campaign called *Smokescreen* that aims to bring this issue to the general public to garner support and awareness as more and more censorship legislation loom on the horizon. Later this year, we'll create a website to host a clear set of actions that people can take to help, as well as printed collateral and a public space to reach a wider audience.

Before all of this happens however, I need to know I'm heading in the right direction. Any ideas you can give to these 5 questions would really help me out a lot.

1. What do you realistically see as being the future of the internet if we don't act now?

2. Say I'm completely computer-illiterate or spend no real time online, why should I care?

3. Likewise, what can I do to help offline?

4. Directed at Project Meshnet itself, how would a community run/funded network hope to compete with the already established ISPs that have government support?

5. Lastly, have you heard of any good statistics/information that would kickstart the public into action? E.g. under ACTA, airport officials would be allowed to search your mp3 player for pirated content.

Like I said, any and all responses are helpful to me. As for myself, I'm a graphic designer in Sydney, Australia and I know how to create a project with a cohesive identity and goal in mind. To you all, keep fighting the good fight.

Lets say we have AwesomeLand, AwesomeLand has city A and city B, both of these cities have large populations of CJDNS users and really robust mesh networks, so robust in fact that the suburbs between A and B contain more than enough nodes to connect them. 

There is a fiber line between city A and city B where two enterprising users decided to setup nodes on either end of the cable such that each node can reach the other city in one hop instead of traversing the suburbs between. 


Now that we have our situation laid out I can ask my question, since each k-bucket is populated with nodes at a given distance how is the relationship between nodes that can connect in one hop expressed?

So ah, just wondering:

Is website still an appropriate term? Or is it a darksite?  

Is it possible for people with high bandwidth to host multiple sites for multiple people with crappy connections?

The code is [here](https://github.com/subtlegiant/Alpaca-VRR).

VRR is a decentralized mesh networking protocol that collects nodes into a ring-like distributed hash table (similar to some Bittorrent clients). The cool part of VRR is that you can have a huge number of nodes (this module supports 2^32 per ""ring"") and not need to flood the network in order to route; the longest path length is bounded by 2n-1 of the optimal path length between nodes. There is a paper about it [here](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/antr/MS/vrr_sigcomm.pdf) and a proof of the 2n-1 number [here](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/81834/VRRT.pdf).

While working on this project, I realized how VRR could be used to create a completely pseudonymous/secure network; your node ID doesn't have to be a 32-bit integer, but rather it could be a public key, so all traffic could be transparently encrypted and MITM-proof.

The code that has been written so far is a proof-of-concept, thus it isn't really viable for a large-scale project. It also implements VRR on the link layer, which obviously wouldn't work for a global network. Thus the first order of business, should anyone want to take this torch, would be to implement VRR as a userspace client that tunnels VRR traffic over IP.

And since we want to make the mesh net as accessible as possible, we can't have people installing software they don't fundamentally need.

Mesh news isn't super centralized, I don't know if others plan to use BATMAN again at some point, but for now it seems like everyone's happy to just use Babel.

In /r/dorknet we get [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dorknet/comments/xry23/this_is_my_first_time_hearing_about_darknet_i/c5p7bev):

&gt; As far as the general term, a darknet is any network that's completely disconnected or hidden from the traditional internet. This was never a really good term for the project, which is why it got rebranded more accurately later as Project Meshnet, but there was no good way to change the subreddit name, so we were pretty much stuck with /r/darknetplan.

&gt; Closer to what you were actually asking, Project Meshnet is an interesting technological and social effort to transition the world away from ISP-owned internet architecture, and more towards community and individually owned internet hardware, using physical-layer peer-to-peer mesh technology. The idea is that having the majority of human communication occur in plaintext untrusted connections relayed over a handful of telecoms monopolies is a BAD thing, and having a secure and censorship-resistant personally-owned replacement system is a heck of a lot better.

Reading between the lines here, some network project emerged and grabbed the /r/darknetplan space for its purposes?  And this project isn't really about darknets, but meshnets?

Can anybody tell me if the Meshnet project is censorship resistant and maintains anonymity of its users, i.e. has something to do with the aims of darknets?

The term darknet has a lot of weight associated with it.  It means absolute anonymity, absolute censorship resistance.  Absolute meaning to the maximum technically possible.  Meshnet sounds very wimpy.  I wonder if it has real backbone.  From the [Free Network Foundation](http://thefnf.org/?page_id=772):

&gt; That’s why we don’t want to see it taken over by profit-motivated corporate interests. 

Sounds a bit adbusters, a bit Occupy.  It does not ring of the cypherpunk ethos that would be required to actually pull off a censorship resistant network.  To a somewhat vague question about legality:

&gt; Networks that are owned by their users are subject to the same rules and regulations as networks that are owned by for-profit operators. 

Does this mean obeying the rules and regulations of the state, i.e. reproducing the regimes of censorship?  

Someone else [said](http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/117f5l/im_sure_youre_all_subscribed_to_rtechnology_but/c6k1mi7):

&gt; If you want to be able to torrent anonymously, i2p. Else, Tor. *Meshnet isn't for anonymity or privacy.*

Starting to think meshnet has nothing to do with darknet at all.  Actually, meshnet might be the opposite of the darknet, and a hobby for do-gooders who actually love censorship, but only when they are the censor.

**PART 2: The Big Question**

So, please allow me to pull the veil off this Meshnet you are building, so the rest of the world can know exactly what is being aimed at.

**Are the coders of Meshnet ready to create the next big child pornography trading technology?  If not, tell me how meshnet technologies will enable law enforcement to stop child pornography traders in hyperboria.**  

To me this is the question that makes or breaks Meshnet.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not advocating child pornography.  I'm saying child pornography is the test of whether your network is actually censorship resistant, and a weigh scale for your balls to see if the culture can stomach what it is it says it is setting out to do.  Absent either of these (tech or culture) and Meshnet is just a playpen for bored geeks who want to pretend to save the Internet.

Standard channel width is 3khz which is a pittance as compared to the 40mhz available for wifi usage. This over 1000 fold difference seals the case against using HF radio as speeds in excess of 9.6kbps are impractical or potentially unlawful.

VHF (the next frequency band up from HF) has more available bandwidth but still has a relatively small allocation at only 4mhz of total spectrum. It's propagation is nowhere near that of HF either.

The UHF amateur band however has 30mhz of spectrum total. So while not as large as wifi (and obviously we can't consume the whole spectrum) there is still a fair amount of bandwidth. A bit of intuition leads me to believe that a reasonable allocation of 5mhz would net us about 4mbps of bandwidth.

In terms of range we should be able to hit the radio horizon with ample power. This should be somewhere between 13-18 miles without needing huge towers to provide fresnel zone clearance like wifi (though they would help!).

We face the following problems:

1. You don't live close to anyone in the physical darknet.
2. People will not join the darknet if there is no incentive.
3. Without decent-bandwidth throughput and global reach, there is no incentive.

A lot of people are inspired by connecting to their neighbors and creating a local, organic mesh with cooperation and teamwork. But that puts the cart before the horse, I think. Yes, it's a noble long-term goal, but in the short term, to make that happen, we need to start setting up long-range links between hobbyists, and create a long-distance low-hop infrastructure. The local meshes will grow around these access points, and not the other way around.

I know these are inflammatory words, but I am not trolling (the idea that ""trolling"" is expressing contrary opinions has become prevalent, it's not. trolling is engaging in antisocial behaviour for the purpose of instigating conflict and derailing discussions.) and I intend on qualifying these statements.

Let me say that first, as I am subscribed to this sub, I obviously have some interest vested in the idea. There are plenty of legitimate reasons to at least theorize about implementing a sort of alternative internet, if not at the very least just for fun! I myself have several major complaints with the internet as it stands:

*  ICANN's stranglehold on the DNS. If .xxx wasn't already enough, gTLDs are basically outright admission that ICANN is a racketeering group. Seriously, read their .xxx ""Trademark Protection"" bit, it almost literally reads like, ""Nice trademark you got there, it'd be a shame if not registering it under a TLD you will literally never use to pre-empt domain squatters would be used as evidence of abandonment...""

* The intrinsic insecurity of the internet, and the mess of band-aids that form the horribly byzantine set of protocols which it relies on. In particular the vulneraibility to things like DDoS'ing.

* Outrageous abuses of local monopolies by ISPs. Filtering traffic, throttling, not even providing the bandwidth you pay for, port blocking, instead of, you know, investing money back into the network.

There are of course many more shortcomings I could list. However, instead of discussing how to remedy these and others, many if not most comments seem to be devolving into wild, baseless speculation. Specifically, it seems to be a common belief that the US government is explicitly preparing some sort of mechanism to censor the internet en masse. There is a quote I like by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, that I believe to be pertinent to this issue, ""Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer; nothing is more difficult than to understand him."" SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, CISPA, etc were/are all stupid, and harmful but people seem to misunderstand why they exist. It's exceedingly easy to relegate Congress, RIAA, MPAA, and others into some nebulous concept, of ""the Man,"" but doing so would be incredibly naive. Do I think groups like RIAA and MPAA are composed largely of greedy jerks? Yes. Nevertheless, just because people are greedy does not mean they try to blow up the proverbial dam, or whatver, just 'cus. That doesn't even make sense. I was against SOPA not because I think piracy is some sort of right or that the gub'ment had it in for me, but rather because it had far-reaching implications and imposed US law upon an international entity. 

The thing is, people attach this odd messianic quality to the internet. At best it's misguided, but at worst is reminiscent of a creepy modern-sort of ""White Man's Burden."" Columnist Evgeny Morozov writes, ""When we get the remote Russian village online, what will get people to the Internet is not going to be reports from Human Rights Watch. It’s going to be pornography, ‘Sex and the City,’ or maybe funny videos of cats.” But the biggest problem is that this mythologized struggle against the internet, as some sort token of democracy, is fundamentally misguided if not delusional. For starters, the internet was conceived of by the epitome of ""the Man:"" the DARPA and the US Militarily People do not seem to understand how censorship in dictatorships work. As a dictator is ""the man"" and the internet is some sort of symbolic vigilante, people somehow think a dictator can't access it, or doesn't know about Facebook. The most publicized instances, for instance blacking out all communications in Egypt, have also been the least successful. Think about it, what is more suspicious? Blocking the internet, or a couple of sweat shop shills make fake blog posts? Perhaps the most egregious instance of this stupid saviour complex was the non-existent ""Twitter revolution"" in Iran. I won't bother explaining why it didn't actually exist, there are plenty of articles which can. What I will say is that using Twitter as a medium for activism is almost literally the stupidest way of doing so I can fathom. Twitter is almost a perfect example of of anti-privacy. Who needs spies when dissidents will state their location publicly. 

Well, I apologize for these overly long post. Hopefully, we can put down the tin foil hats and try to discuss the pragmatics of the Darknet.

Here's my understanding. I understand what a mesh network is and how we can share the connection between these 'islands'. It seems like a good idea.

But ultimately it has to be lead back to a source connection right. Some people actually have to have an actual internet  connection which will in-turn be connected to an ISP type of service. Won't the people who pay, look after, host/share this connection be liable for the data that passes through the source connection?

[Please take a look at this awful image I made in 2 minutes](http://i.imgur.com/7SkYs.png)

Now in this example we have 9 islands in total, but only one (top) has an actual internet connection. No problem, each island is able to get a share of this connection through the mesh network via the quickest path.

I don't understand how this is immediately better, sure 8 islands can now connect to the internet when previously they could not (without getting their own internet connection), but as stated above someone is still going to have to pass through ISP's that deal in handing out the internet connection. Won't that still be able to be restricted/filtered?

Again in that example, if the ISP blocked facebook.com, it would be blocked for all the other islands too as they are getting it from the one island that has an internet connection?

**IN A NUTSHELL**

1) Will people who actually have the internet connection be liable for the data that passes through it to and from the other islands

2) What happens if an ISP blocks a service or site (perhaps only applicable from my unique [example](http://i.imgur.com/7SkYs.png))

We also have to keep in mind the fact that routers themselves are highly vulnerable to hostile takeover, and the radio hardware itself is not very rugged.

There are several problems related to this model, like cost and ownership, most of which can be solved with an open content distribution network.

**About me**

As this is also my first post in this community (besides a few comments), I though I'd start off by saying hi. I've been following this project for a while, but only just now have gotten time to participate. I'm a 23 y/o web developer from Norway, Oslo, working on both the client and server side. I consider myself a skilled, although I obviously have lots still to learn.

I'm interested in helping out any way I can (and have time for). I'll get onto IRC one of the days in the near future, but let me know if there is something before I have a chance.

**Problem 1: It's pricey to do business**

It's easy to get a server set up on the Internet, and it's easy to start serving a few pages to a few people. It's also quite cheap, or even free. Starting a Facebook or Youtube competitor however, is a million dollar investment, solely because of infrastructure (given you'd get the same visitors of course).

So even if you have an application, which in quality far exceeds anything already on the market, you might not be able to release it properly, simply because of lack of funding. And even with funding you would have to find a way to return that investment, probably lowering the quality or value of the product.

*- Whoa! Your app is so smooth - it must have been expensive to make!*

*- Well.. Our app is worth $20, our fiber is worth that to the power of twenty-eight.*

**Problem 2: ..and there it broke**

Does it scale? Probably not. Closely related to the first problem is the risk of your service failing once it gets too popular. We've all seen the ""please try again"" pages around the web, often here on reddit, because the sites is getting too many visitors at once. While this can be blamed on the provider for not keeping up to speed, a DDoS attack cannot.

*- I though we wouldn't need to care about this scaling-shit once we where set up in the cloud.*

*- You still need to configure, tweek, hack, optimize and rent more servers, stupid!*

**Problem 3: Locking down is the norm**

On the desktop I am able to choose whether I want to open a movie in VLC, MPC or WMP, but I don't have that choice when it comes to a Youtube video. It's not that it's technically impossible (or even difficult), but that Youtube would lose revenue, and hence doesn't allow it.

API's goes a long way to help share and distribute content, but any API only offers what the content provider intends to share. Youtube's ""API"" (read: embed) sucks, because you aren't getting the raw data. Facebook's API sucks, because you aren't getting the whole picture. Twitter's API sucks, because your searching/traversing abilities are limited.

*- I have some old photos on Facebook. How can I show them to my granny, who doesn't use Facebook?*

*- You can't really. You know what they say. Same shit; same wrapping.*

**Problem 4: My content - your rights**

As soon as anything is submitted to a service, it is most likely bound to any terms and agreements that has been accepted by the user. In some cases that means the service actually owns the content, and is free to use it as they please. Dropbox had an episode, Facebook have had several, and I'm certain you'll find something questionable in a lot of EULA's, TOS's and similar abbreviations.

While we have to understand that these companies does this mainly to protect them self, it's still a huge problem awaiting climax. No application or service should ever be able to claim rights to your content, unless you explicitly give it to them.

*- Did I get this right? In order to use your service, I have to give up commercial rights to my thoughts?*

*- Just sign on the dotted line please.*

**Problem 5: No easy way to audit**

While we might trust a lot of companies with our data, we have no real way of verifying their intent, or validate that our data is treated as it should be. The only thing we know for sure is that we are sending way to much information to companies that really doesn't need it.

I understand the risks, and know how to limit the spread of my information, but it's still almost impossible to use internet on a day-to-day basis without revealing who I am and what my interests are. The only reason this vast amount of personal information is valuable to anyone is to provide targeted advertisement. Compiling a list of recommended movies only require information about other movies I like, not the clothes i wear or the places I've been to.

*- I watched one episode of Epic Meal Time, and now every ad on Google is some unfamiliar bacon brand.*

*- You have to even it out by searching for the opposite. Try 'PETA'.*

**Problem 6: One fall and all is lost**

Censorship is still a huge problem on the internet, and by taking down the entry point(s) to a service, all the content will be inaccessible. Even running a Tor hidden service can, if located, be taken down. It doesn't happened often, and with cjdns making it harder to locate and take down services, we are certainly going the right direction.

But the problem remains; it's possible to censor services, whether the one doing the censoring is the government, the service provider or an hacker.

*- My favorite site showed this FBI warning today, like I have been doing something wrong.*

*- It doesn't matter if it was wrong, but whether someone else earned less because of it.*

**So, what's the solution?**

This isn't an easy one, and there are several major changes that needs to happen in the ecosystem. What I propose here is only the initial thoughts on a system to solve the above problems, and I'm looking for any and all feedback. I'll try my best to describe what I have in mind, but don't hesitate to ask if I missed something.

Now, in short, this is the proposition: A protocol allowing publishing of information in a distributed peer-to-peer manner, without the need of any central servers. Content would be signed by the provider, then published to all peers the provider is connected to. These pees will be able to share the content to other peers outside of the providers reach.

Applications made for the protocol should be written in web standards, so it can run in the browser as well as being openly audited. I propose a stricter installation and permission process than current webpages gets today, requiring the user to accept the functionality and content the application gets access too, just like on a smartphone.

Content is published through a *stream*, identified by an address (hash). A stream is first created by some process claiming the address, then lives on until the network collectively forgets it. Anyone can create a stream, without cost or other conditions. The owner of a stream decides who is able to publish to it. This makes it possible to set up different distributions schemes, such as one-to-many (newspaper, movie studio) and many-to-many (discussions, collaboration tools).

When content is published to a stream it does so by a *post*, which is also identified by an address. The post contains metadata, as well as the actual contents. A post can carry multiple types of the content; a title, a thumbnail and a movie are all different content in it self, but can be related.

The whole process is tied together with a DHT, and a pub/sub model between peers. Applications, instead of sending http requests, subscribes to a stream (or a content type, tag or w/e) to get the content. This can of course be annotated with data from other sources, for instance for search or multi-factor authentication, but all content should be published through the system.

With the right implementation, applying strong security where needed, I can see this being used for almost all kinds of internet communication. There is nothing in the way of creating a Reddit- or Facebook-like application using a protocol like this, and it would massively increase the users ability to filter and interact like they want. (At least like *I* want.)

There are some problems with this solution as well, such as spam and bad content, users having to store data on their machines again (maybe not a problem?) and piracy. Probably other problems too, so let me know.

I have some other thoughts on how go a little further, but I'll start with the above. Instead I'll just leave the keywords here.

* Web of trust system (to battle spam and similar) (upvote/downvote)
* Smart DRM/licensing system (usable and open)
* Streaming
* Identity handling
* Proxying

**Keep feedback constructive, and discussions relevant.** This is a post intended for serious discussion, and I expect to get serious comments in return. Go ahead an hurt my feelings, as long as you stay on topic.

With the recent popularity that this subreddit has accomplished, more technical people have started looking at our previous ideas with critical eyes. Several explanations have been published pointing out the problems we'd have to overcome to make our ""mesh internet"" a reality.

We could just ignore all those facts and continue trying, but there are problems with the following things:

* Bandwidth: by definition, and using cheap radios (half-duplex), the bandwidth would be very scarce. Most users would try to use the meshnet to surf facebook and turn it down after experiencing browsing like it was back in the '90s.
* RF unreliability and randomness: people far smarter than I have already worked in deploying wireless mesh networks, and they have found that the 2.4GHz spectrum is... funny.
* IP Address asignation: though there have been some breakthroughs that could make auto-assignation somewhat possible, there are always risk of collision without having a central authority.

And many more. However, this doesn't mean that creating an internet like the current one with user-owned infrastructure is impossible. It just means that we'd need to improve our technology by orders of magnitude, and it'd be far more costly than exploiting what we already have to our advantage.

If we take a step back, we'd all agree in the following: we want to create a tool to route around censorship. If this is our goal, maybe we don't need to create a new internet. Maybe what we need to do is create tools, hardware and applications which ensure free speech.

My idea is the following:

Remember UUCP? It was popular back in the day. With it, you could route packets to other compuers. Usenet was basically a meshnet, but with dial-up. 

Maybe, just maybe, we can create a new layer 2 protocol which doesn't require IP address, and is broadcasted to the whole network. This way, bandwidth wouldn't be a problem: only text messages would go through the network. Maybe small images too.

This would be the perfect way to create some sort of ""twitter"" for events like OWS. There is no central server hosting it.

This is how it would work: users would have an application in their smartphone which implements our protocol. Let's say we're building a distributed twitter.

When I send a message, I'm broadcasting it over WiFi to nearby people or computers with our software running. It has some metadata, like a uniqueid for that message, the original application used to send the message, and so forth.

Then, my friend, whose phone is close to mine, receives that packet and his application shows my ""tweet"". Then, he can choose to relay that message, so more people can hear me.

It'd be also pretty nice if we wrote some software for our hardware which would store the packets it receives in some sort of storage, and keep broadcasting them locally. This ""repeaters"" could be connected to other repeaters, and so on.

I would love to hear criticism about this idea, but I believe it is what we need to do to move forward.",,False,self,t5_2rju2,False,,,True,t3_mryre,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/mryre/we_may_need_to_rethink_our_goals_heres_my_idea/,moderator

I have begun setting up an OLSR meshnet in Pittsburgh, PA and I have prepared 3 WRT54G routers with DD-WRT with OLSR. Problem is, I can't figure out what the proper configuration is supposed to be to get my routers successfully meshing. There is essentially no clear guide to setting up your configuration (No, this link: http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Mesh_Networking_with_OLSR does not count).

I'm here to change that. 

I would like some assistance from a knowledgeable person out there to help make a guide for setting up, configuring, testing, and maintaining a small OLSR network. And I want to make it pretty so Reddit will give me lots of upvotes. If you have experience with OLSR DD-WRT, Freifunk, or OpenWRT, please get in touch or point me to a guide that I have somehow missed to accomplish my work.

Thank you

The more I think about this the less I believe it needs to replace the entire internet. There's just no reason to wire up House of Hwang's Chinese Food, Spuds Rent A Car, Franky's Hot-Dogs, Amazon or Netflix... this stuff will still exist. What really needs to be available is localized information and a method to connect with an international backbone. I believe communication is the key word here. I see Meshnet as the ability to communicate between individuals without jumping through a set provider, without having everything you do or say monitored by a company.
  
Let's say each person wanting to be a node operator with Mesh paid $150. In return they got a cheap tower and a wireless router (they could also build it for free by installing some sort of LAMP stack). If they pay everything has been burned and ready to go, they just turn it on (router included). The only reason I bring up a paid model is to have something that is repeatable. Maybe they order all the parts from newegg, doesn't matter really.  
  
When it is plugged in it acts as a wifi hub, anyone could connect into this wireless router (no security). The only trick is they don't get ""internet"" access. Instead they then hit 10.1.1.1 and they would have a simple apache webserver running the following:  
  
1) The last stable build of wikipedia (maybe a few months old, updates every month)   
  
2) A craigslist style website for posting anything  

3) Some sort of optional user profile method, like email, where you can post information anonimized, maybe the equivalent of twitter so people can tweet things over this internal network
  
4) A local chat room.  
  
5) Legend of the Red Dragon  

Once a day it shuts down for a few hours and syncs up with the other nodes and downloads new data. This could either be done ""backbone"" style where it connects with a central server using the real internet (for example, getting the wikipedia update) or ""local master"" where one node in a cluster is declared the backup or rotated round-robin style. This could be left up to the groups themselves. If international groups want to communicate they just need to agree on a method of syncing. Since we're not talking about the entire internet the amount of data will be significantly smaller (no need to sync wikipedia, it'd just be the craigslist postings and possibly tweets).

So if you want to send photos of police brutality from your state you would connect to any node, post it like craigslist, and if that node chooses to sync it would be synced up using whatever methods it has available.
  
Just a thought. In my opinion this is much more tangible. It also leaves the real decisions to the **node operators**. If they want to mesh this they can, if they want to backbone it they can, if they just want a silo'ed device they can do that as well.

Project Darknet

In light of current events, an online community, once unknown to the average Internet browser, has exploded in growth. Ever since the United States started their controversial SOPA Act, or Stop Online Piracy Act, the internet has banded together to try and stop this obstruction of free speech. While many try to convince the US to stop their hypocritical attack against our rights, others, notably the Darknet Plan community on the website Reddit, are trying to set up an open internet, if you will.


While our modern Internet is connected through fibre-optic cables, towers, and other wiring, the Darknet Plan is trying to push the boundaries of technology by creating a completely wireless, and therefore an internet that is under the control of no one. This mesh of wireless networks will create an online base where there is no infrastructure to take control of; basically, a place where privacy is abundant, and censorship is banished. 
So what is the problem with our current Internet? First and foremost, everything is connected physically connected to each other. Although your laptop and cell phone may be connected wirelessly, that modem is connected into another set of wires. All of these wires are corporately owned by companies like Verizon or Comcast. To cut off parts of the internet, the government only has to issue a law stating that these places must be blocked. The Darknet Plan, however, is an internet operated and run not by ISP (Internet Service providers), but by the users themselves, and is therefore completely free to use.


Imagine the internet as a single track, with mini-tracks (branching out into computers. The single track connects everybody together. Parts of this single track are owned by companies who charge us for using their track. This is what we use now. If the mini-branch or main branch is blocked, most of the computers will lose access. 


Now imagine a gigantic spider-web that covers every computer in the vicinity. Each intersection of strings, or mesh-client, is in fact a computer, or cellphone. Some of these intersections are also stationary; these mesh-routers connect everyone as well, but they don't have to connect to the internet at all! These points of connection are known as nodes. Essentially, every computer is connected to several other computers. If one node, or computer fails, the others continue to operate, either directly or indirectly, with other nodes. To push the analogy further, this spiderweb is wireless; There are no lines to control, and if a node gets taken over, the others can still operate.


This system has many benefits over our current system. By connecting nodes to each other, the Internet becomes private. This system can be both decentralized, or centralized, and both be equally as reliable. If this web were to cover a whole city, then a laptop or cellular phone could go anywhere within that city and always be connected. Imagine going from one Starbucks to another without having to lose internet. Moreover, if this type of network managed to be connected over an entire continent, one could go an a road trip, and still have a reliable internet!


Despite all its advantages, governments still tries to suppress this effort. Ironically, the American government uses this system on the battle-fields. However, as this community-driven effort grows, so does the realization of a dream. A dream of a free, private, and reliable internet.",,False,self,t5_2rju2,False,,,True,t3_mj89f,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/mj89f/im_writing_a_darknet_article_for_my_school/,

My idea is very green and I would love input to build on the idea or point out its faults. 

The concept revolved around bbs/image boards and torrents. Threads would be like torrents, shared among the users that connect to it and updated p2p. The website would essentially act as a user tracking the updated threads and bumping them to the top of the page. If users stop posting and everyone closes the thread, it is gone forever. Websites using this method would start the threads and provide a place for users to post, threads could be connected to multiple websites as well. New posts would be regarded as new data and shared p2p, tacked on to the existing board. Simultaneous updates would be handled by time clocks. Running this on something like TOR or I2P would allow it to be anonymous. 

I know it is a very raw thought, but I am interested in developing the thoughts around it.",,False,self,t5_2rju2,False,,,True,t3_10jo0h,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/10jo0h/idea_for_distributed_communication/,

However, I am back! And armed with photoshop, ready to make some backgrounds as I am hilariously bored with nothing else to do! I'm making them mesh themed, incorporating green and hexagons where possible.

My main question is, what resolution do you want them in?",,False,self,t5_2rju2,False,,,True,t3_vwwlo,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/vwwlo/yo_meshnet_im_making_backgrounds/,

The difficulty in being an open project is not releasing information. The difficulty lies in correlating that information, explaining it in detail, and most importantly making it accessible. IRC, Mumble, that's where information goes to die, sure its open but following a conversation without context is nigh impossible, as the founder of /r/Civcraft that activity was fostered with a lot of effort. By taking ideas discussed in other places and carefully organizing them before presenting them to the subreddit, its long, its boring, but taking the time to sum up a conversation on IRC and post it may be the biggest contribution to the project you can make, programmers are skilled, but they are only human and can only help if presented with the right information. 


There is plenty to talk about, just bring it out here, make diagrams to post where everyone sees them, post about the trivial changes in each build, and always link to source documents if possible. Repeating the same conversation over and over again is tiring, its boring, and when people simply refuse to search for old ones it can be maddening, but keep doing it. 

If you want to know about Meshnet go to IRC or Github, if you want to help Meshnet bring something back.",,False,self,t5_2rju2,False,,,True,t3_vj1w7,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/vj1w7/the_biggest_contribution_to_meshnet/,
