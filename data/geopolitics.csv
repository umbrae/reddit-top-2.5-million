Militarily speaking, the USA would crush Iran. The USA could send Iran back to the stone age without Iran ever touching US soil.  

Only with its air force and navy, the USA could paralyze pretty much any other nation and impose its power unchallenged in any airspace or water. 

One reason for this is because the US military budget is absolutely indecent. They have this unmatched military arsenal because they have been paying for it, for the last 50 years. Even the USSR could not keep the pace.

Granted the USA would find it impossible to invade and occupy large and powerful nations such as Russia or China, but, could we agree that, if nuclear weapons are put aside, the USA could paralyze and submit any nation using air and naval forces. 

If we add the element of alliances, maybe a few countries could ally and challenge the US this way but it seems very unlikely in a short term view. 

And finally taking into account the fact that resources are being fought over as never before and will eventually come short, forcing countries to fight for the same resources in order to feed their economy. This situation will bring more and more pressure on every country, resulting in them building their military in order to be ready.

So in resume,

- The USofA is the only Super Power left.
- The USofA's military force is overwhelmingly powerful
- The USofA has internal political and economical problem linked to the funding and use of its army
- The USofA's army is a huge part of its economy and foreign relations
- Other nations are building up
- Fewer resources are being fought by more customers
- Other nations may eventually feel confident enough to challenge the USofA into a ""real"" war.
- USofA may eventually be unable or unwilling to fund and maintain this army
- Taking Nuclear weapons into account but assuming no country would dare pull the trigger
- Taking also US alliances in account

The question :

When is it foreseeable to think that a military power or alliance could even dare take the US and its allies in a direct war and, if they should dare try, stand a chance? Or would ever such a thing happen in the first place?

EDIT: I see i receive downvotes... i don't really get why and its no big deal but, i chose this subreddit because i thought we could have a decent discussion here. I am not from the USofA, this is a serious question i am not being cynical or anything and english is not my first language so i could ba making lots of mistake. Why am i being downvoted on such a small and specific subreddit? I mean, im obviously not after the karma.. but just wondering.

It made me wonder what likely effects would result from a fairly significant military power that has little foreseeable cause to prepare for conflict (ie. most European countries) were to abolish its military. I'm curious to hear opinions either in a general context or specifically to France, which I think is an interesting candidate for such a scenario because it is a nuclear power that is a member of NATO and a veto member of the UNSC. How would the effects be different if it were to disband all conventional forces but keep its nuclear strike capabilities? 

**EDIT**: Using the term ""middle power"" was a mistake. First because France **is not a middle power**. I think this question is more interesting and more realistic for a middle power, but then I got caught up on France for other reasons and didn't think it through. Second is that middle power remains a vague and disputed term so the conversation inevitably will lead to arguing over its definition rather than the question. I think I should have stuck to a theoretical question rather than specifying any one country in particular. So far there's been some interesting points though!

To try and get to the root of my initial thought, what role does a peacetime (ie. no foreseeable domestic threats) military play for a country that is an active contributor in international efforts across the spectrum? Would disbanding its military effect their ability to influence their allies or even non-allies that do not currently consider them a threat? The loss of jobs tied to the military-industrial complex would be substantial (at the very least effecting the currently enlisted), but could the resources be redirected into more long-term beneficial projects? Obviously without military capabilities a country would not be able to contribute forces to multilateral intervention campaigns. Why does this matter? Could they not contribute other resources (logistics, intelligence, funding) through a civilian organization? What if they replaced their military with such a civilian force that is trained in humanitarian relief and other non-combat roles that a military currently serves? Basically, what essential *political* roles (if any) does a military serve that a non-war fighting (and therefor drastically cheaper) government institution could not provide?",Question,False,self,t5_2qhnn,1375290476.0,,,True,t3_1jeh9z,http://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/1jeh9z/question_what_would_happen_if_a_middle_power_such/,

I make no claim of objectivity; I have, by now, a pretty clear opinion about what's going on.

My post follows below.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's all an act of aggression against everyone involved. They are just testing the water to see what they are capable of getting away with.

You want a spy movie read? Check this out. It's all from real world events.
If you piece together all the Wikipedia articles about Litvinenko, the Russian Apartment Bombings, Assassinated businessman Boris Berezovsky, Asassinated journalist Anna Politkovskaya, the Stratfor Hack which ties multinational corporations to Private Intelligence Corporations, Global Intelligence, Private Security Contractors, Money Laundering to hide the trail of the decision makers, their relations to Wikileaks, Wikilieaks relation to whistleblowers, and Snowden's current situation of being a whistle blower....

Everything starts to get crazy.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko#Russian_apartment_bombings
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Politkovskaya

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Berezovsky_(businessman)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Stratfor_email_leak

&gt;WikiLeaks founder **Julian Assange told Reuters that his concerns with Stratfor stem from it being a private intelligence firm relying on informants from government agencies with dubious reputations, both from the U.S. and abroad,** and especially its targeting of activist organizations.[5] He also called the company a ""shadow CIA"" and stated that the emails would ""reveal Stratfor's web of informers, payoff structure, payment-laundering techniques and psychological methods.""[24]

&gt;Al Akhbar, citing internal emails from the **Stratfor hack, reported former Blackwater director James F. Smith had a relationship with Stratfor and was for a time considered one of their major sources. Emails appeared to show that Smith participated in the murder of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi**, and had more recently been assigned to aid the rebellion against the government of Bashar Assad in Syria. In relation to his assignment to Syria, Smith requested an intelligence overview of the Syrian opposition from his Stratfor briefers.[17]

&gt;An email involving **a Stratfor analyst stated that it had been determined that up to 12 officials in Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency knew of Osama bin-Laden's safe house.**[11]

&gt;emails reveal that Stratfor had been partnering with Shea Morenz, a former **Goldman Sachs director, along with other informants, in order to profit from what could be considered insider trading. Stratfor planned to use the intelligence it gathered in order to profit from trading in several worldwide markets.** They created an offshore ""share structure"" known as ""StratCap"" during 2011, in order to avoid insider trading allegations.

Also worth checking out is Russian President Vladimir Putins role in Gazprom the largest natural gas comapany in Europe and one of the largest corporations in the world. 

Here is the type of organization Putin made Gazprom.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_champions

&gt;National champion is a political concept in which large corporations in strategic sectors are expected not only to seek profit but also to ""advance the interests of the nation.” This policy has been popular and practiced by many countries.

Next is worth checking out Putin's networth. (Dick Cheney, Haliburton, etc)

Review everything above with past CIA/NSA scandals from the United States at home and abroad and you can see just how fucked up and interwoven everything and everyone in power really is.

http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/08/codebreaker-death/

As well as *whistleblowers from the World Bank* of which almost every nation is a member. They help move the secretive money around and launder it all.

&gt;**Allied Barton, the International Security Contractor and contractor for security personnel at the World Bank** who was responsible for **Hudes´illegal arrest**, *is owned by members of the same cartel that controls the Bank for International Settlements, 40 percent of the asset value of 43,000 transnational corporations and financial institutions, and 60% of their annual earnings.* http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1107/1107.5728v2.pdf

Internal reports, reviewed by FORBES, show, for example, that even after Zoellick implemented a budget freeze some officials operated an off-budget system that defies cost control, while **others used revolving doors to game the system to make fortunes for themselves or enhance their positions within the bank.** Why not track all the cash? 

Good luck: Bank sources cite up to $2 billion that may have gone unaccounted for recently amid computer glitches.

Sadly, the last part is cultural: The bank, those inside and outside it say, **is so obsessed with reputational risk that it reflexively covers up anything that could appear negative, rather than address it. Whistle-blower witch hunts (see box, p. 92) undermine the one sure way to root out problems at a Washington headquarters dominated by fearful** yes-men and yes-women, who–wary of a quick expulsion back to their own countries– rarely offer their true opinions.

The UK Serious Fraud Office also called the Securities and Exchange Commission to inquire into the World Bank’s accounting irregularities. Hudes reported to UK Parliament that the SEC stonewalled the Serious Fraud Office.

Edit - Just to note since my comment will probably have a lot of responses I would like you to remember the links posted and their stories and also think about how it's all just so unbelievable that these situations are happening.

*And have been for a while. It just goes to show how much distraction there is and how much pressure is put onto whistleblowers to keep information like these stories from having staying power in the mainstream media.*

Imagine if these were the types of stories the press reported on instead of the stories we get from them now.

",11,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/trikc/history_of_geopolitics_alfred_t_mahans_idea_that/,"Alfred Thayer Mahan was one of the leading figures of classic geopolitics of the late 19th century. He was a U.S. navy flag officer and arguably one of the most important strategists of his time. In 1890 he released his book: ""The influence of sea power upon history"" where he stated that greater naval power leads to greater worldwide impact. This idea got a warm reception in the dominant powers of the time: Great Britain (until then the world's dominant force), U.S.A. and Germany (the main contenders to take over the position of world leader) and Japan (the upcoming military power in the far east) started an arms race for the greatest navy. Mahan's idea's were mainly based on previous phases of global war where Great Britain had defeated dominant powers such as France and The Netherlands because of greater naval strength.

1331552707.0,6,self.geopolitics,qssmp,Can anyone explain the purpose and idea of this Geopolitical framework?,7,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/qssmp/can_anyone_explain_the_purpose_and_idea_of_this/,"It's from a reading in my textbook (please excuse the dotpoints. I copy-pasted it from a document im writing up):

**Rules:**

•Agents cannot act freely, but they are able to make choices

•Agents act within structures

•Structures limit, or constrain, the possible actions of the agent

•Structures also facilitate agents, in other words they provide opportunities for agents to attain their goals

•An agent can also be a structure and vice versa.

**Structure:**

•A structure is a set of rules (form as in legally enforceable laws) and norms (culturally accepted practices) that partially determine what can and cannot, could and should not, be done.

•In this sense, structures are expressions of power as they define what is permissible and expected.

Agents:

•Agents are those entities attempting to act.

•In other words, a woman homemaker may be viewed as an agent, and the patriarchal household a structure.

      o	Another view, the very same household can be seen as an agent negotiating the laws and culture of a country, which is interpreted as the structure.

•The self-same country may be seen as an agent operating within the structure of the international state system with its international laws and diplomatic customs.


**Conclusion:**

•This framework shows that agents are given both opportunities to act but also constraints to their possible actions given the structures they operate within.

•Second, agents will be able to use, and be frustrated by, a number of structures simultaneously, given the multiplicity of spheres they operate within.

•Third, we can see that a particular structure is not monolithic but made up of a number of agents

•Fourth, by knowing that agents are simultaneously structures and vice versa, we can think of the opportunities of agents and the barriers they face, within a hierarchy of geographic scale.

•Finally, it must be stressed that structures are the products of agents

**What's the purpose of this framework?**

Is it merely to show that all Geopolitical *agents* (be it an individual, state, etc) must operate based on the rules set by *structures*, and that these agents will themselves become *structures*?

What is the application within the world?

Thanks for any help.

Seems like the author just assumes that as a given and doesn't spend any time providing proof of that assertion. Seems to me that sectarian violence could definitely be the cause of political conflict, at least in some cases.

If anyone knows of any good sources that might address this topic, I would really appreciate it! Here's the analysis in question if anyone's interested:

Quote:
&gt;The call is the latest sign of deteriorating ties between Tehran and Baku and follows a March 30 conference in Baku organized by groups seeking independence for Iran’s sizable Azeri minority, which includes prominent figures such as Ayatollah Khamenei and opposition leader Mir Hossein Musavi.

&gt;Speakers at the conference, whose title has been rendered in English as ""Tomorrow of the Contemporary Southern Azerbaijan,"" reportedly said that Iran faced a dire political future because of sanctions and international pressure, and predicted that the northwestern provinces -- which they referred to as ""Southern Azerbaijan"" -- will ""inevitably"" become independent.

&gt;Reports say the conference, which was organized by the so-called National Liberation Front of Southern Azerbaijan, was attended by activists, academics, and former Azerbaijani officials. Current Azerbaijani government officials were reportedly not present at the conference.

&gt;A participant was quoted as saying by the Turan news agency that ""If the Iranian government loses control, the National Movement is ready to take control of Southern Azerbaijan.""

&gt; Azeri separatists, who have little support among Iranians, refer to Iran’s East and West Azerbaijan provinces as ""Southern Azerbaijan,"" suggesting they need to be liberated from Iran.


The region mentioned as ""Southern-Azerbaijan"" is of great geopolitical importance because it is located directly next to the Caspian Sea and is Iran's main gateway to that sea. The Caspian sea is of importance because of the natural resources it contains such as oil.

For further reading about the importance of the Caspian Sea, check out [this](http://www.asc-centralasia.edu.pk/Issue_63/04-THE_ECONOMIC-AND-GEO-STRATEGIC.html) article.

Quote from the abstract:
&gt;The Caspian Sea is one of the most important source of world’s energy resources, after the Persian Gulf and Siberia. However, one of the most serious limitations to its development is the lack of a legal regime, which has led to serious disputes among the littoral states over the question of energy exploitation and distribution. Politically, as well as economically, certain regional and international powers are trying to expand their sphere of influence in Central Asia and Caucasus and a strong rivalry is emerging among these powers for the control and exploitation of the energy resources, termed by some scholars as the New Great Game. 

Edit: Sigh, hate it when I make a typo in the title.

Edit 2: Found another article you might find interesting:
[Azerbaijan's Geopolitics and Oil Pipeline Issue](http://sam.gov.tr/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/NASIB-NASSIBLI.pdf) and for those with less time on their hands a shorther and easier article on the Iran-Azerbaijan relations. [Iran-Azerbaijan Relations: Minor Dispute, Far-Reaching Consequences](http://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/iran-azerbaijan-relations-minor-dispute-far-reaching-consequences-4773/)

Important quote from the last article:
&gt;Economic growth in Azerbaijan is met with fear by officials in Iran. With the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in place, there is the potential for explosive economic growth in Azerbaijan. This could potentially stir up southern Azerbaijani-Turkish ethnic consciousness within Iran, which in turn could cause a great deal of sectarian unrest. Although energy cooperation is a major factor in Iran-Azerbaijani relations, it is doubtful that this cooperation will ever develop to the point where it takes on a strategic element. This is in part due to the growing influence of outside players, particularly Western states who wish to control energy resources in the area and block any and all Iranian attempts to exert their influence.
