It stars Dave Foley (*The Kids in the Hall*) as the news director of a radio station, who struggles to manage the personal and professional issues amongst his staff. It also stars Stephen Root (Milton from *Office Space*), Andy Dick, Maura Tierney (that actress from the 90's who was almost, but not quite, Jennifer Aniston) and the late Phil Hartman (you might remember him from such beloved *Simpsons* episodes as ""A Fish Called Selma"" and ""Realty Bites"").

The show does have a laugh track, so if you can't deal with that then it's probably not for you (also you need to be less close-minded). I compare it to *30 Rock* for a number of reasons: they're both set behind-the-scenes of a broadcast network, the main character of both is in a position of power but often feels uncomfortable there, he/she has to deal with an egotistical star and is frequently observed and advised by a wealthy corporate superior. Both shows also have a pretty frenetic pace, which I assume is endemic to their respective settings. And if that ain't enough, *30 Rock* [was originally intended to be about a news show as well](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock#Conception).

The comparison to *Community* is because the show takes a pretty great amount of care in avoiding common sitcom cliches, especially for it's time. As soon as the second episode, you should see a pretty huge subversion of the typical sitcom formula.

I've seen a lot of these listed, but there are also a bunch I've never even heard of and I went ahead and made a list of everything. I seperated all of the movies into their proper catageory the best I could, but everything else is just put in a single catagory since there wasn't much to work with. Also, I added links to Netflix (*) for the titles available to stream in the US, otherwise they're linked to IMDB for the movies, Amazon for the books, Steam for the games (Wiki's for the ones not on Steam) and Music is linked to whatever album is available album on YouTube. I'll add to the list if/when other people chime in, otherwise this is more than enough to get someone started and kept busy for quite a while.

People have told me I would like Crystal Castles and MSTRKRFT, but I didn't really love them and I think the problem was it felt like the music wasn't made with any real instruments.  I definitely like to be able to hear the feeling and the playing, that's what I can really rock out too. 

In summary, anything is awesome but bonus points if its instrumental and has lively (distorted) guitar!



I've also noticed that some of these bands have albums I love, and some that I really am not into at all, so to guide your recs further:

* Ratatat: *Classics* and *Ratatat* I've listened to LP3 and LP4 and I really didn't like them much at all...

* Justice:  *Audio, Video, Disco*  Every instrumental track on here is totally awesome (Canon, Horsepower, Parade etc).  Some of *Cross* is cool too

* Phoenix: *Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix* is my favorite, with ""Love Like a Sunset"" being my favorite track.  I also like *United* but in a totally different way.

* Daft Punk: *Discovery*.  I haven't found another song I really liked by them on any other album (besides the Tron Soundtrack)

It's really hard to put into words, but I'm looking for something where the author toys with everything the audience and characters think they know.

EDIT: Scratch the above. I liked the concept of parallel worlds in The Butterfly Effect (and could have watched 10 or so more alterations of the protagonist's life). I loved the bits of The Truman Show when Truman began his escape- the whole 'one man bringing down an artificial world' thing was wonderful. And, to cap it all off, I loved the overall feel of Donnie Darko. If r/ifyoulikeblank can recommend a film based off these nonsensical ramblings, I shall be eternally grateful.

I'm especially interested in book suggestions as I rarely see people suggesting books similar to these. It's not really the jazz music or anything I like from Cowboy Bebop, I just like the space western style and the concept of a group of likeable outlaws travelling together in an interesting setting where hijinx will inevitably ensue. Both of these shows also have a great balance between drama and comedy where they're not overly serious, dark and humourless but not 'happy fun times friendship!' either.

[Lights - Cactus in the Valley(Itunes session)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETS4L1S4v1w) - Debated putting this one here.  It is the lyrics/singing more so than the rest of the music that does it for me.

[The Weeknd - Wicked Games](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PuAm7d0PA) - I like this one a lot, but I have not found any other songs by him that I like.  

**[edIT - Dex](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWemXNsSl10)** - This entire album has long been one of my all time favorites.  

I know a lot these are pretty wildly different from each other, and that is my problem.  There is something similar between these songs that I love, but I can't quite grasp what it is. Any suggestions you think I'd like based on these would be awesome.

Before the set started the members of the band was DJing the venue for several hours, and played some very atmospheric folk/countryish music. Think music with a feeling of the dark sprawling forests, snowy plains and mountains of the north, music you could imagine played in some stereotypical bar or truckstop in Alaska. Think Jack London, some black metal, mostly acoustic (don't limit yourselves though).

I know this is pretty vague, but hopefully some of you get what I'm looking for.

EDIT:
Wow, I'm pleasantly surprised by the amount of answers in this tread, thanks to everyone who took the time to reply.
UNFORTUNATELY, after having listened some to pretty much every posted suggestion, none of it has really been what I'm looking for, though plenty of it is very nice music in its own right and some of it has been kind of in the right direction. I realize that it's very hard to explain a certain mood one is after and that it's always going to be highly subjective what constitutes ""dark/atmospheric"". Having spent some more time thinking about what I'm actually after, I realize that my original explanation might have been somewhat lacking in conveying what I'm really looking for.

I want the music to be gritty and simply processed. Imagine an old, gnarly man with a beat up guitar and a raspy voice playing in some old cabin made of logs, snow whirling outside, the air inside heavy with the smell of woodsmoke and tobacco. Imagine fur coated people sitting around a fire in the wintry forest of canada, playing moody tunes on fiddle and banjo, maybe with some occasional chanting for good measure. I want it to be rough and unprocessed and rural. 
Frankly, I'm not even sure this music exist, and if it does I'm not sure it's on the internet.",,False,,t5_2sekf,1349216320.0,,,True,t3_10s3lm,http://www.reddit.com/r/ifyoulikeblank/comments/10s3lm/musiciil_darkatmospheric_folkcountry_music_with_a/,

The Avalanches have traditionally been described as a band that uses sampling a lot.

What I liked about Since I left you was that in addition to being ratehr original in its musical style, it also managed to step beyond that. Many of the albums I've listened to that have frequently been described being similar to the Avalanches have fallen short in that their albums don't really form any cohesive unity. There are just individual songs that don't play well with each other. SILY also had a nice mix of varying styles of music - hip-hop, indie rock, dance music and jazz.

For me, Since I left you was a very cohesive and visual album, and I felt the album really created a world of its own. This is unfortunately rare for and electronic album, and I wonder if any of you guys here know any other albums that are of similar style? Both on the musical style, and also being cohesive and atmospheric as an album. I feel like many albums either don't go anywhere but just meander around (Endtroducing) or are too hyperactive and miss the marks on the pacing (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome).

For reference, I've already tried the following popular suggestions (and then some):

* DJ Shadow - Endtroducing (pretty nice, but lacked in substance, and stuck to the bleeps and bloops style)
* Kid Koala - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (hyper-active)
* J Dilla - Donuts (meandering) 

Sorry for the wall of text, I hope someone has something in mind - even if you're not sure about it, go ahead and post.

Edit: Another sample, by the Avalanches: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u8dPN0M5dk This is a live recording from one of their shows. I enjoy this one a lot as well - the instrumentation and sapling is fun and varied. It is a different take on their genre, as a live show instead of a cohesive album. Recommend something like this as well.

Jack: Women your age are more likely to be mauled at the zoo than get married.

Also, there are secondary traits to these kinds of characters; due to their wealth/success, they are oblivious to the 'real world', and this obliviousness can often reveal itself and make them seem foolish, e.g.:

Jack: It's after six. What am I, a farmer?

What books will I like?",19,2,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/ifyoulikeblank/comments/1hzjia/booksiil_dark_intense_movies_with_much_character/,"I watch films as often as I can and have a huge list of recommendations I need to go through. But, I would also like to start reading literature. I want to look for, as the title suggests, a book that's dark in terms of style, tone, or story and, intense in the sense of pace, theme, or detail. 


I would also like very detailed characters, whose motivations/history we can understand easily. It would also be good to have some sort of deeper theme throughout the book and great use of metaphor (I'm not a fan of the Christ metaphor but if done well I'd read it)

And as far as conflict, I enjoy a character in torment. Some sort of psychological suffering. Or they could be trying to fight that which is out of their control (the supernatural, the inevitable, or a higher authority).

Any one of these traits in a book would be fine but, the more the merrier. Some films, that I like, that fit some of these descriptions are [12 Monkeys](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114746/), [Dark City](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/?ref_=tt_rec_tt), [Oldboy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/?ref_=sr_1), [The Machinist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361862/?ref_=tt_rec_tt), and [There Will Be Blood](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/?ref_=sr_1)",,False,,t5_2sekf,False,,,True,t3_1hzjia,http://www.reddit.com/r/ifyoulikeblank/comments/1hzjia/booksiil_dark_intense_movies_with_much_character/,

Vocally, I enjoy well executed screaming and growls. Revocation and TFOT over do it for me frequently.

Clean vocal only like DT or no vocals like AAL and Impact Fuze are good too. 

Instrumentally, I am looking for motifs and reprise, variations on riffs, arches, mix meters, polyrythms, and complexity without wanking (Dream Theater's been wanking too much lately imo with their solos).

They're somewhat subdued with an ominous feeling to them, hinting at what's to come and ratcheting up the tension as the song progresses rather than in genre.  I'm mostly looking for songs with cleans vocals, but it can from a hardcore or metal band. [The Dillinger Escape Plan's Setting Fire to Sleeping Giants](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO89M730hDY), though a good song, is an example of what I'm *not* looking for.

Edit: I know I made this thread looking for suggestions, but if you're a fan of some of the music here you should listen to How To Destroy Angels.  It's a (relatively) new band formed by Trent Reznor (of NIN), Mariqueen Maandig (Reznor's wife and lead vocalist), and Atticus Ross.

Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained to a lesser degree

The Manhattan Projects (comic book series that injects alternate dimensions, aliens, Oppenheimer's evil twin, etc. into the story of the Manhattan Project)

Watchmen and Superman:Red Son (what would have happened if superheros were around during the cold war)

I picked up Chabon's Yiddish Policeman's Union and I'll give that a read.
