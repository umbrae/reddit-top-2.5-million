A time comes in your life when you finally, in the midst of all your fears and insanity, you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out…ENOUGH! Enough fighting and crying and blaming and struggling to hold on. Then, like a child quieting down after a tantrum, you blink back your tears and begin to look at the world through new eyes.

This is your awakening.

You realize it’s time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change, or for happiness, safety and security to magically appear over the next horizon.
You realize that in the real world there aren’t always fairy tale endings, and that any guarantee of “happily ever after” must begin with you…and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance.
You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love, appreciate or approve of who or what you are…and that’s OK. They are entitled to their own views and opinions.
You learn the importance of loving and championing yourself…and in the process a sense of new found confidence is born of self-approval.
Your stop complaining and blaming other people for the things they did to you – or didn’t do for you – and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected.
You learn that people don’t always say what they mean or mean what they say and that not everyone will always be there for you and everything isn’t always about you.
So, you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself…and in the process a sense of safety and security is born of self-reliance.
You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties…and in the process a sense of peace and contentment is born of forgiveness.
You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view. You begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for.
You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values you’ve outgrown, or should never have bought into to begin with.
You learn that there is power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a “consumer” looking for you next fix.
You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a bygone era, but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life.
You learn that you don’t know everything, it’s not you job to save the world and that you can’t teach a pig to sing. You learn the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry and that martyrs get burned at the stake.
Then you learn about love. You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be. You learn that alone does not mean lonely.
You stop trying to control people, situations and outcomes. You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO.
You also stop working so hard at putting your feelings aside, smoothing things over and ignoring your needs.
You learn that your body really is your temple. You begin to care for it and treat it with respect. You begin to eat a balanced diet, drinking more water, and take more time to exercise.
You learn that being tired fuels doubt, fear, and uncertainty and so you take more time to rest. And, just food fuels the body, laughter fuels our soul. So you take more time to laugh and to play.
You learn that, for the most part, you get in life what you deserve, and that much of life truly is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different than working toward making it happen.
More importantly, you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction, discipline and perseverance. You learn that no one can do it all alone, and that it’s OK to risk asking for help.
You learn the only thing you must truly fear is fear itself. You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your own terms.
You learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom.
You learn that life isn’t always fair, you don’t always get what you think you deserve and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting, good people…and you lean not to always take it personally.
You learn that nobody’s punishing you and everything isn’t always somebody’s fault. It’s just life happening. You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls.
You lean that negative feelings such as anger, envy and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you.
You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted, things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about: a full refrigerator, clean running water, a soft warm bed, a long hot shower.
Then, you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself and you make yourself a promise to never betray yourself and to never, ever settle for less than you heart’s desire.
You make it a point to keep smiling, to keep trusting, and to stay open to every wonderful possibility.
You hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind.
Finally, with courage in you heart, you take a stand, you take a deep breath, and you begin to design the life you want to live as best as you can.

* Gurus have lied to you; you don’t to be passionate about something to succeed
You don’t need to even like or love the task or what you are doing.
Emotions comes &amp; go isn’t a steady state &amp; if we all depend in our emotion &amp; passionate state to work well the world would be doomed long time age.
All comes to the rational mind; you need to use the rational mind to control your emotion
* First: don’t let the task define your worth or happiness &amp; don’t try to be perfect Make a guarantee to yourself: ""Whatever happens, I will survive. I make myself safe."" This feeling of safety removes the threat to your survival, attacking the idea that your self-worth is based on your performance. With this connection broken, the anxiety that leads to procrastination will also go away.
* Second: Don’t make yourself a victim &amp; feel you are forced &amp; have to do the task 
* You are in control “Choose” to do the task that will give you sense that you are in control 
* You don't have to _want_ to do things, or love doing them. You just have to choose to do them and commit to them. ""I _am going_ to the store; I _will be_ at the dentist's at 3:00pm; I _am going_ to traffic court this morning."" You might as well make your chosen tasks as pleasant as possible.
* And when you find yourself losing motivation, look for the hidden ""have to"" and make a decision. Choose to embrace your path or let it go. It _is_ your choice.
* Third: Break the Project Down &amp; don’t compare performance to the final outcome 
* Fourth: THE SECERT OF MOTIVATION 
Distant and indefinite rewards do not produce much motivation -- rewards must be more immediate and definite. ""In other words, to control your work habits you must make the periods of work shorter (less painful) and the rewards more frequent and immediate (more pleasurable) -- interlacing short periods of work with breaks and rewards

This where all Guru Fail at They all want you to focus in the final outcome While actually psychologist say we must focus on the process because normally people will compare where they are with the final outcome which seem distant &amp; hard to get and to make it worse they make you visualize (Gurus) about the things that you will have if you achieve the outcome &amp; when you fail to follow through the process you will feel worse

He is always in a good mood and always has something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, ""If I were any better, I would be twins!"" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant.

The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.

Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up to Jerry and asked him, I don't get it! You can't be a positive person all of the time. How do you do it?"" Jerry replied, ""Each morning I wake up and say to myself, Jerry, you have two choices today. You can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood.

I choose to be in a good mood. Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or I can choose to learn from it. I choose to learn from it. Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose to accept their complaining or I can point out the positive side of life. I choose the positive side of life.

""Yeah, right, it's not that easy,"" I protested. ""Yes, it is,"" Jerry said. ""Life is all about choices. When you cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice. You choose how you react to situations. You choose how people will affect your mood. You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood. The bottom line: It's your choice how you live life.""

I reflected on what Jerry said. Soon thereafter, I left the restaurant industry to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often thought about him when I made a choice about life instead of reacting to it.

Several years later, I heard that Jerry did something you are never supposed to do in a restaurant business: he left the back door open one morning and was held up at gun point by three armed robbers. While trying to open the safe, his hand, shaking from nervousness, slipped off the combination. The robbers panicked and shot him. Luckily, Jerry was found relatively quickly and rushed to the local trauma center. After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Jerry was released from the hospital with fragments of the bullets still in his body.

I saw Jerry about six months after the accident. When I asked him how he was, he replied, ""If I were any better, I'd be twins. Wanna see my scars?"" I declined to see his wounds, but did ask him what had gone through his mind as the robbery took place. “The first thing that went through my mind was that I should have locked the back door,"" Jerry replied. ""Then, as I lay on the floor, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live or I could choose to die. I chose to live.""
""Weren't you scared? Did you lose consciousness?"" I asked. Jerry continued, ""...the paramedics were great. They kept telling me I was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the ER and I saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got really scared. In their eyes, I read ""he's a dead man.""

I knew I needed to take action."" "" What did you do?"" I asked. ""Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me,"" said Jerry. ""She asked if I was allergic to anything. 'Yes,' I replied. The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply. I took a deep breath and yelled, 'Bullets!' Over their laughter, I told them, 'I am choosing to live. Operate on me as if I am alive, not dead.'""

Jerry lived thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude. I learned from him that every day we have the choice to live fully. Attitude, after all, is everything.

1369856533.0,30,self.selfhelp,1fadjv,Brother spies on me in the shower.,37,7,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1fadjv/brother_spies_on_me_in_the_shower/,"I'm going through some issues, and I just need to vent out I guess. I'm aware that since I'm a teenager, my 'issues' may just be hormones messing with my head. I'm also aware that my so called problems are nothing compared to what most people go through, and even to what I will go through once I'm an independent adult. But at the moment, I'm caught up in a heavy emotional tirade, and I just need to reconfigure (for lack of a better word) myself. 
So, the place to start would be the issue I think has affected me the most psychologically. I have never mentioned this to anyone before, and probably never will. (Strangers on the Internet don't count :P) 
A little bit of background info: I am a  15 year old female, living in India, and have led quite a sheltered and privileged life. I have a 17 year old brother. My problems stem from him. 

When I was 13 (I think), I discovered that my brother spied on me when I was in the shower. When I found out, I was completely horrified, and couldn't think straight for the next week. We had a very healthy relationship, our family is very close-knit and happy. My brother and I were also very close and it absolutely disgusted and horrified me that he could maintain that facade in front of me and do such unspeakable things behind my back. 
I became aware that he regularly tried to look through my bathroom window. Of course after I found out, I made sure it was closed properly, the blinds were shut, etc.
Around the same time, when I was temporarily sleeping with him in his bed, I woke up one night to his face nuzzled into the back of my neck, and heavy breathing. His hand was on the small of my back, barely touching, but still there. I instantly moved, made it seem like I moved in my sleep. He backed off for a while, and when he again started to move towards me, I pretended to wake up and go outside. I never slept in his bed after that. 
The shower watching thing went on for a year and a half. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't tell my parents, that was completely out of the question. I thought about letting him know I knew, but I was too scared. 
My mind knew I had to do something, but my heart defended my brother. He was going though the horny teenage phase, it would be over in a while. I just had to make sure he could never actually see me naked. 
He did, and still does love me, and care about me immensely in a brotherly manner. 

Fast forward to a month back. I thought it was over, there had been no episode for months. My brother and I were closer than ever. 
We were at my grandma's place, I was having a bath. I thought i heard a noise, and lo and behold, what else do I see but the top of my brother's trying to peek into the stall. I went into the other room as fast as I could, and I'm pretty sure he didn't see anything. 
But it caused all the insecurities, the emotions, which I had tucked into the back of my head, to well up in me again. 
Now, another thing has got me scared. I have a boyfriend, who loves me very much, and I love him a lot too. It's not the hormonal teenage love either. I had thought about sharing this with him, but I could never bring myself to it. He was sexually assaulted as a child, and he has shared it with me, and I'm helping him work through his problems. But I still cannot tell him. 
Anyway, I had certain pictures of myself on my computer (to be sent to my boyfriend). They were deleted after sending, of course. But now, to recover some lost photographs, my brother is running a photo recovery software on my computer. He has to look through 80000 pictures. He will see those pictures of me, and they will be near the top. That scares the fuck out of me. I can't imagine him looking at them, and possibly, fapping (cringe) to them. I don't know what to do. I can't let this continue. 
I have done nothing but be kind to people my entire life. My existence is based purely on making others happy. What have I done to deserve a fucking pedophilic incestuous son of a bitch for a brother? 
I hate him. But inspite of all this, a part of me still loves him. And I hate myself for that. I cannot care about someone like that. It makes me sick, but I do, I do love him. He's my brother. 

EDIT- Fuck. I just realised how long this was. I don't expect anybody to read it. 
 And to those who did read through, forgot to mention, my brother is also a redditor. There's a chance he will see this. ",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_1fadjv,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1fadjv/brother_spies_on_me_in_the_shower/,

I have expanded on it and I use it every day for everything from little problems to life changing decisions.

It's extremely simple and we sometimes use it without realizing it.

Quote:
**“Within every problem you can't solve, there is a smaller problem you can solve.”**

Find a problem, then break it down until you find a problem you can solve, then solve it! Once that is solved, you can begin to work your way up to a solution.

Example Problem: I can't afford my current living situation.

Why?

1. New problem: My bills are too damn high!

	A. Breakdown: My rent is too high.

		Can you move to a smaller place?

		Can you rent out a room?

		Get more income (Go to #2)


	B. Breakdown: My utilities are too high.

		Can you cut back on usage? (Electric, Water, Cell Phone, etc...)

		Can you cut back/reduce any bills? (eg. Netflix, Internet, TV, Cell Phone)

		Get more income (Go to #2)

	C. Breakdown: My dept bills are too high (see #3)



2. New problem: I feel that I am underpaid.

	A. Breakdown: My job pays too little.

		Are you due for a raise?

		Are you underpaid for your industry?

		Can you find a better position or improve your skills?

	B. Breakdown: I need a second job or more hours.

		Can you find another part time job?

		Can you start a side business to earn some extra money?

		Are you already overworked? Find a different job.
	


3. New problem: I have too much dept.

	A. My dept bills are too high.

		Have you considered consolidation services?

		Have you tried to get a loan in order to self-consolidate?

		Have you considered bankruptcy?

	B. My student loans are too high!

		Have you thought about forbearance or deferment options?

		Can you go back to school part time in order to defer payment?

		Have you looked in to loan forgiveness plans?

	C. I can't afford my dept payments.

		You may be underpaid or need to cut other costs. See #1 or #2




This is a brief example, but you can see how we can take one large, overwhelming problem and start to break it down in to more specific problems. Eventually, we will have to find one that we actually have control over. 


Example: 

I can't afford my current living situation...

→ Because my job pays too little

→ → Because I am underpaid for my industry

→ → → Solution: So I will brush up on my skills and apply at another company.


My car is broken...

→ Because it wont start

→ → Because I turn the key and nothing happens.

→ → → According to research, no noise at all may refer to a dead battery or bad connection.

→ → → → Jump start didn't work. Battery may not be holding a charge.

→ → → → → So I tried a different battery and now it starts. Solution: Needed a new battery.",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_1hvo06,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1hvo06/a_problem_solving_strategy_that_has_helped_me_for/,

I've been dealing with a problem for pretty much my entire life. I don't really feel like a real person. I mean, of course, I am, I have a life with happiness, sadness, wins and defeats, etc etc. But somehow it just doesn't feel real. I read people's writings, see their Facebook posts, and all that, but I feel so disconnected from everything. I see things happening around me but don't see myself in any of it. It's not that I don't feel like I deserve any of it. I've had a good life and consider myself a lucky person to have everything that I have. But it doesn't feel like anything at all. I find it hard to place myself in that place of 'deserving' things like dreams, friends, love, etc. I just don't know what any of it means. It feels like no one really takes an interest in me, which of course isn't the case, but on my side it feels that way. It's caused a lot of problems in relationships (or lack thereof). I am fine talking with girls, but I can't imagine why they would want to be with me, and so for that I don't pursue anything. 

I think it comes from growing up out in the country, without a tight knit community. Now I'm living in a large city and feeling alienated and I don't know what to do.

I just want to know what it feels like to be accepted and validated, and needed. How do I go about this?

When you think less, you are less attached to the person you are defined as based on the past. This is so powerful because this is the very thing that allows you to change. If you do not do this, then no matter what else you read or what else you try to do, you will never really improve because you will be identifying yourself with your past, and everything you do will go through that filter, and whether you like it or not, the tendency will be to do what you have always done. The key is to meditate and become at peace with what is happening at this very moment. Then you are always at a fresh start to do the things that you choose, without the filter of the past getting in the way and causing you to make the same mistakes over and over again.

Not when it comes to speaking them at least. I’ve spent my entire life keeping everyone at an arm’s length. Not because I don’t want to know people, but because I’m fundamentally broken.

It all goes back to my youth. 

What they don’t teach you in elementary school is the important things. They don't teach you how to communicate, or love, or live. They don't teach you that life is meaningless. They hide reality behind the fake curtains of endless distraction; Television, video games, books, movies, God… the list goes on and on.

I wish I could count the hours I’ve wasted away doing absolutely nothing of substance. But I would argue it’s not entirely my fault.

I’m fundamentally broken because the system is fundamentally broken.
Why is it that in this day and age we don’t teach children what’s actually important in life? As school children, we’re constantly taught to strive for the top and become the best. Whether it's in math, reading, or science. But why is that more important than being taught how to love, how to live, how to communicate, or how to mourn?

Doctors and Scientists spend their entire careers wondering why so many people take their own life. They chalk it up to ‘abnormal brain chemistry’ or ‘genetics.’ But I know that’s not the truth.

The truth is our wasted youth.

You see, the fundamental problem is that we (as children) spend every single day of our lives from ages 5 to 18 doing the exact same thing. We get up, we get ready, we go to school, we learn algebra or biology or some other useless bullshit, we get taught what to think, we get taught who to be, and then we go home.

We’re never taught how to be ourselves. We aren't taught how to think for ourselves. And we’re certainly never taught essential life skills like communicating, love, financial responsibility, coping mechanisms, or happiness.

And I ask, “Why not?”

How is algebra more important than LEARNING how to live? How is learning the layout of a simple cell MORE IMPORTANT than learning how to be emotionally happy and fulfilled?

Some might say, “Well, it’s each person’s job to learn how to do that. It’s something that one learns through experience.”

And I would say in response, “How the fuck are you supposed to learn to do something when you have no experience or example to pull from?”

Seriously, ask yourself how many people you know that are actually happy and fulfilled. You know, the type of people that love to get up in the morning because of what the day brings.

Do you know how many people I’ve ever seen actually live life like that and be happy?  One. And I can easily imagine it's the same for most people.

Can you honestly say that you’re happy? No, I don’t mean content. I mean truly happy and fulfilled.

I know I can’t, and I find it hard to believe that a majority of people can either.
There’s nothing fulfilling about slaving your life away in some meaningless job doing something you don’t love. But yet… that’s what we’re taught to do. That’s how we’re told it’s supposed to be.

But that’s not how it’s supposed to be, and it’s completely this society’s fault.
Our cold war era education system is outdated. If it was a guitar, it’d be severely out of tune.

Don’t get me wrong… math, biology, and all that shit is somewhat important. But equally important is teaching children how to live, laugh, and love. 

I would even argue that it’s more important to teach kids how to do those things… how can basic science or math be more important than learning basic principles to live by?
How can a geometrical shape be more important than knowing how to live? Why aren’t we taught the skills necessary to be happy? Why aren’t we taught how to harness life to its full potential?  

And I mean truly harness it and live it for what it’s worth. Not just be ‘content.’

The fact is, schools should teach you how to be a person; your own person. Not some ideal image of what they think you should be.

They should encourage you and plant seeds that help you find who you really are.

They should teach kids lifelong habits, cognitive thinking skills, financial responsibility, coping mechanisms, how to live, laugh, love,  and more.

It shouldn’t just be about the numbers and facts.

It should be about living life itself.

Do you want to know why so many people want to kill themselves?

I would imagine it's because they don’t know how to live.

And it’s not their fault. We’re just a factor of the society that created us. Sure, a select few of us may be able to break the mold and be happy.

But for the majority, it’s a life of meaningless, unlimited consumption; a false sense of content and enjoyment.

So why do so many of us ‘off’ ourselves?

Because we don’t know how to live.

We don’t know how to enjoy. And we’re not okay with all of this other crap that's just 'in the way.'

We get thrust into the real world and suddenly our little fairy tale of everything being perfect and everyone giving a shit is broken.

Life isn’t pretty. It’s ugly, it lacks purpose, and it’s boring.

My point is… why aren’t we taught how to have a purpose?

Every single day of our lives as a school child we live under this false reality that life is meaningful, that every one cares, and things will just ‘work out;’ that there’s some sort of plan to this whole thing.

But there’s not a plan. Everyone is faking it. Things don’t work out and NOTHING is guaranteed.

The tricky thing about life is things only work out when you make them work out and that’s the problem.

We are never taught how to work things out on our own. We aren’t taught how to problem solve or emotionally take care of ourselves. We aren’t taught the basic fundamental needs that life requires.

So why, again, do so many people kill themselves?

Because they can’t handle this. They can't handle life.

They can't handle the reckless thoughts and emotions that eventually cloud their minds when their carefully crafted framework is broken.

They can't handle the fact that every time they look outside, all they see is happenstance.

Sure, some people can get by with their cheap forms of entertainment and daily routines. Maybe a vast majority of them do.

But for those of us that can’t… we’re left with the gigantic task of actually figuring out how to live and be happy.

The problem is though, we don’t have a model to look at. There’s no instruction manual to life.

So we get stuck… man, so many of us get stuck.

And we can’t quite figure out why we feel what we feel and we have no fucking clue what to do about it.

And we look around and we see so many fucking people seemingly living happy, normal, lives and we’re tortured by it. We constantly ask ourselves why we can’t just be like them. Why we can’t just be whatever they are… 

But the truth is… they aren’t happy. At least not the ‘real’ happy. They’re just wasting their days away until one day they’re going to wake up and ask, “What the hell happened? Who am I and how did I get here?”

So maybe these feelings that I’m having now are a blessing in disguise.

Maybe my mental confusion will somehow bring me out ahead in this conundrum.

Maybe… just maybe my realization that everything is bullshit will enable me to see life for what it really is and enjoy it for what it really is. Maybe this will allow me to saddle up and ride it for what its worth.

But I do know this:  So many people before me that have felt the same way and have tried to overcome these feelings have failed. Each year the suicide rate rises.

Do I want to become another statistic? God, I hope not. I certainly don't plan to.

But these feelings aren’t easy to deal with, and that’s because no one ever teaches you how to deal with them and that's not fair.

Like I said… how can we 'live' if we don't know how? 

But each passing day I can see why they choose that way out.

It’s not our fault that we’re brought into a world and taught a certain framework of living that just doesn’t hold up under a microscope.

It’s not our fault that no one showed us the way.

So to those of you out there like me who feel lost… empty… bored… and hopeless…

Here’s to you.

Here’s to hoping that somehow we can logically think our ways through this tangled framework of lies called life.

Here’s to hoping we can be happy again... like we used to be when everything was meaningful and nothing hurt.",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_19s5u2,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/19s5u2/im_on_the_verge_of_insanity_so_i_wrote_a_little/,

AMA if you need advice with your current situation.,32,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/grik0/my_story_of_hitting_rock_bottom_and_making_it_out/,"Throw a way because even my own family and friends do not know this unedited truth about my life.

Back in 2008 I was making 40k a year and living the dream. I was cocky and didn't understand how lucky I was to have a well paying job with benefits. Needless to say I left the company due to me thinking I could get better pay somewhere else. I cant say that I had worst timing, a full on recession started and I was out a job. I thought with my education and skill sets, employers all across the city would be dying to hire me. Boy was I wrong. Things got so bad so quick, I took on a job waiting tables to make ends meat. It was funny because even when I was working at the bottom I still had a pep in my step. An aura that I knew I didn't belong there and lived and expected better things to come. 

I was able to get another desk job later that same year but at the start of 2009 the company had massive lay-offs and I was out a job this time out of no fault of my own. Again I was back to square one. Believe it or not I spent 9 months on unemployment living off $1600 a month. My monthly bills were $2500, mortgage payment, car payment and all. I maxed out every credit card and loan option given to me. By this time I also had depleted my savings. 

I took my job as a server back where I was the year before. It was nostalgic in a way and also humiliating. I knew I was destined for greater things and the staff at this resturant took pleasure in seeing me come back. Not that they want me to fail but because that validates their own stagnate lifestyle. Many of these people are career waiters and in my opinion it is pathetic because some of these people are brilliant but lack the ambition to take chances. I worked as a server for 6 months before finding a new job.

I found a job with a shady Door to Door sales dept. I sold *** Services door to door! This was nuts the lifestyle was wild but the pay was good. I did so good at the job that my boss asked me to go with him to out of town to open a new office. Fresh leads and better pay was the promise.  I had nothing to lose so I left. 

The summer of 2010 I spent 1400 mi away from home. Talk about stressfull. I had a mortgage and a car to pay back home but work up north. Needless to say this place was a hell hole. We got leads in the ghetto of town. I got robbed on the street, we spent most of our time there penny less, any money I did make went straight back home. It was horrible. I remember hitting rock bottom up there. No money, no food, miles away from family, no way to make it home what so ever. I thought I was done! I remember buying an bag of potatos because we could eat that for weeks and they would not go bad. Also I lived out of my car for awhile too. It was rough. I was poor, homeless, and the only friends I had with me, I just met that year.  I had to come back. Luckly my boss was fed up with the city too and decided to come back to my hometown. I convinced him to take me with him. 

Once I was back I home I made a promise to myself to not let things get out of hand again. I was very tired of the Door to Door scene as well. Although I was making good money the job was horrible and hours long. A person who I was trying to sell stuff to worked for a good company and recommened me for the job. I was interviewed along with 300 people and I was 1 of 5 people to get the job. Just like that I went from having nothing to a 100k a year job. I am sitting a work with a smile on my face and feeling like I won the lottery everday at work.

Yes, I got lucky. But the reason I was able to get lucky was that I took every opportunity presented to me and worked every angle of my current situation before I gave up and tried something different. I hit rock bottom several times from 2008-2010. I must have had 10 different jobs in that time. Some legit and some under the table gigs. But when it came to it I finally came across something good.

The thing is I was prepared at any point to lose it all but knowing that I would work to get it all back if that happend. I came close to losing everything many times. But every time I hit rock bottom. I found a way to pull myself back up. I am not out of the woods yet. I have massive debt, taxes I owe and student loans due. But when it is all said and done I enjoyed the ride. I lived life. And I have stories to tell.

AskReddit.",23,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/188q67/i_feel_somewhat_shaken_by_thoughts_ive_been/,"There was a popular AskReddit post a few days ago about ""the worst/scariest things you've seen on the internet."" I was bored at work, i figured reading a few comments would be pretty benign, i wouldn't click on any links. But honestly, I read a few descriptions of things that were really fucking awful. And I kept reading, maybe out of morbid curiosity. I read to the bottom of the page.

Eventually I stopped reading and went back to work. But I couldn't really focus. That shit stuck with me. Descriptions of videos, discussions, and quite possibly true stories of sick, twisted stuff. 

I knew about snuff, and that there's a market for such things. A kid I knew in high school once brought in a ""edgy"" magazine that had some weird gore-flick related ads in the back. He talked about some dark shit including snuff, and I got a weird feeling back then too.

One of the top posts was about a video made by the murderers of a brutal, and presumably random torture and murder. They then posted it online. The one image I saw when I looked at this video's wikipedia page is an image of two very normal-looking ukrainian kids standing in the snow. They looked like anyone you'd meet on the street. They could literally be anyone.

Besides for becoming increasingly paranoid over that last thought, and feeling unsettled and unable to stop thinking about it, I think the only way of getting past it is to find some way of coping with the knowledge that such people really, truly exist, people I am absolutely incapable of understanding. They have zero empathy. I am perfectly aware of many people who do bad things, but generally I can understand the cause - usually a clear motive combined with an unhealthy dose of stupidity - but in this case, there seemed to be absolutely no reason to do what they did other than making someone suffer. I just cannot comprehend the state of mind of such a person. It makes them seem like an animal, a different species, a real life monster. I am afraid of what I can't understand. But the idea of understanding someone like this is even scarier. I don't really know what I'm asking for help-wise, just anyone who might have thoughts about it. (I'm pretty much ok, my thoughts just keep coming back here and struggling with it now and then.)

I was playing in front of thousands of fans a night and being treated like a celebrity. In December I pulled my groin (or so we thought) and it limited what I could do the rest of the year. I got an MRI done and everything looked normal so I wasn’t too concerned. Once the season was over I got some rest and physical therapy and things seemed to improve. That summer I was invited to a few prospect camps with an NHL team. I always prided myself on working as hard as I possibly could at all times. My view was if 10 years down the road my career didn’t work out it sure as hell wasn’t going to be because I didn’t work hard enough. I was finally seeing my years of hard work pay off and I knew I was only one good season away from having my rights picked up by an NHL team.




The entire summer I was in the gym 4-5 hours a day and putting my absolute 100% into making my dream come true. I went back into training camp in August 2011 with more passion and determination than I can describe. That’s when disaster struck. Both my hips blew out to the point that I could barely walk. At the time I assumed it was simply a strain or bad pull. The team then sent me home to see a doctor and get the problem taken care of.




I got home and the doctor initially thought it was a torn groin, which is an easy surgical fix. I got x-rays, MRI’s, and CT scans done on both hips/groins. When I went to meet with the surgeon to see the results nothing could have prepared me for what he was about to say. He walked in with 2 other doctors and said “Son. What kind of education do you have and what are your plans after hockey?”. I instantly knew this bad news. The ball in both my hip joints was not round and as a result it ground away the cartilage in both hip. On top of that I had torn muscles in both hips and a torn groin on the left side. I was then told they were going to try to fix me but I would probably never play hockey again. For a 19 year old to hear they can no longer do what they’ve their entire life its devastating. Especially when I came as close to achieving my dream as I did. I broke down crying right there in the doctors office and could barely get the words out of my mouth when talking to my dad on the phone on the drive home.




I got the surgery done and my first words after coming out of anesthesia were “Can I play hockey again?”. The surgeon said “I don’t know” which is as good as a no. After 8 weeks on crutches and 8 weeks of rehab I got surgery on my other hip and it went better. I was determined I was going to play hockey again no matter how much pain I had to go through, I was going to prove the doctors wrong. I wanted it so bad. Sure enough by June 2012 I had my contract picked up by my old team, much to the doctors amazement. Everything was going great, I had persevered through the biggest challenge of my life. Then a week before I was getting ready to go to training camp both hips blew out again in August. I was in surgery the next.




Fast forward to right now. I had my fourth surgery 3 weeks ago (2 on each hip) and I’m not doing well physically or mentally. The damage was so severe in my hips that a lot of it is permanent and I’m in constant pain but the mental pain is even worse. I feel like I’ve lost my identity. I put so much work and heart into hockey that I don’t know who I am without it. Its all I’ve ever done. I sit at home and watch my friends sign NHL contracts while I can’t even walk without crutches. I always thought as long as I worked as hard as I possibly could that good things would happen, but the exact opposite happened. I don’t know what to do now, I feel like I have no purpose anymore. I came so close to that goal every boy has a child just to see it ripped away from me, twice.  Sometimes I’ll be laying in bed and it just hits me and I cant help but cry. It such a bad feeling to be 20 years old and already feel washed up. I’ve lost the one thing that I identified myself as and it feels like there a big hole in my gut, like a huge part of me is gone. 




How do I pick up the pieces and move on? I hope within a year or so I’ll be physically well enough to function but mentally I’ve been having such a hard time for the last year. I need any kind of advice you guys have. I don’t care if it’s a story of a similar experience or just philosophy, I just need help moving on.




Thank you so much for the help.

1344490404.0,22,self.selfhelp,xxcd0,i'm suicidal and don't have the courage to talk to anyone else,23,1,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/xxcd0/im_suicidal_and_dont_have_the_courage_to_talk_to/,"Hi reddit.....I'm not 100% why i'm doing this but i'm very well aware that i have serious issues. There isn't a day that i don't think about killing myself and the stupid part is, I don't know why i'm so depressed and suicidal. Now those that know me are aware of my depression but suicidal tendencies i've kept hidden

I've written a suicide letter, thought of the quickest and least painfull way to do it and cried myself to sleep more than once. This has been going on for YEARS and is getting worse everyday. I'm to the breaking point at the moment. I'm a 25 guy btw and have had suicidal thoughts since i'm 14. It's only since I was 21 that I seriously considered suicide and wished death to befall me everyday. How did i get like this? I really don't know, i'm just negative.

Why am I so depressed? I really don't know. I can't say my life is hell but it is pretty sad. I'm going in my 3rd year of University, just got fired from my job and living with my parents. Yes, i've done nothing with my life and that's one of the depressing aspects. People are always unconfortable around me, thinking i am akward, weird, emotional and soft. I try to stay quiet and not be singled out but the second i open my mouth people automatically see the weirdo in me. I have friends yes but it feels like I cannot make meeningfull connections with anyone around me. It's like i'm that guy who's name and face you always forget but is always around with the group of friends and if you do remember me it's nothing good.

Out of frustration, albeit not the smartest thing to do, have asked people why i'm so disliked and odd. People have told me it's just my vibe, the air around me and when i do speak I simple don't talk like a normal person, like i'm empty.

I believe it. Why? I have almost no interests in any aspects of life, i have no passion, it's like i don't feel. 

I know some of you are probably rolling your eyes and going first world problems and you're probably right, but suicidal depression is what it is....and unfortunatly that is what i feel, so that is what i'm expressing. This sounds like a big cry for help...and it is, i'm wondering if anyone else feel the same; like an empty shell that just pretends to keep a smile on but is completly broken inside.

I've gone to therapy, I go to the gym a lot and jogging to boost my confidance, have read books, stood infront of the mirror every morning for months and say i'm happy and positve; and was on anti depressants for almost 2 years. Yet it keeps getting worse.

About a month ago I met up with a friend whom i had not seen in 6 months and within five minutes of being with her she told me my depression had gotten much worse. She cuddled me and almost cried for me telling me she is very worried about my mental health and wishes it could all go away. Another example would be one of my sisters. She came over to drop off something for my mother and in the 15 mins she saw me, called me at the end of the day to talk to me because she knew I was getting worse and is getting increasingly worried. Even though I had kept a smile and joked with her and teased eachother like we usually do, she saw right through me.

When people ask me what is wrong with me, i don't even know what to answer. I should not be depressed. I have two amazing sisters that would kill/die for me. An amazing father, friends that have been by my side wanting and trying to help. I'm doing well in school, girls find me very good looking, have a good roof over my head, i'm very healthy (physically), and have good food on the table everyday. Yet it feels like i'm going nowhere in my life. I feel hopeless, meeningless and that I have no emotions except all the bad ones. I know people with less than half than what I have yet they are twice as happy in their lives. 

I've learned that depression is all in your head it's just an idea a thought. Yet that thought won't go away and DOMINATES my psyche. I mumble to myself throughout the day about killing myself and how much I hate life. I'll have random moments where I just stop everything I do and just shut down, not move, talk or anything and just think of death. Alone is even worse, I just have random outbursts of screaming and crying and yelling out loud that I want to die.....and those kind of outbursts are starting to happen in public.

Why have i not killed myself yet? i'm too scared of death and dying a painfull death.

I just want this depression to go away, i'm ruining my life by holding on to this burden. How do i let go? How do i get better? because frankly i'm all out of ideas.

I'm also the type that enjoys poetry and art and writing, but also enjoy the more ""manly"" things like fishing, watching violent movies, etc.

The big thing for me though, is I still don't know what I want to do with my life. I spent the last 10 years in the military working on aircraft but was recently diagnosed with asthma. I've been advised to stay out of aircraft maintenance and to pursue an office job. I realize that I don't really have any ""talents"" and I have no idea what I want to do when I get out in a few months. I haven't been able to settle on a degree because I have no idea what I want to study. I've jumped from computers to aeronautics (it was a professional degree that I dropped when I realized I wouldn't be staying in aviation).

I know some of the things I enjoy: history, writing, computers (though I know I wouldn't be happy doing it for a living). I just feel frustrated because I don't know what I want to do. I don't know what to study or what to do after school. I'm not looking to make loads of cash.

Through experiencing the most horrific tragedy imaginable for me, I also learned the scope of usual sadness and hopelessness, and this helped me convince myself, one and for all, that the feelings I have been battling since I was 13 are not, and have never been, part of a 'normal' life. Since this 'discovery', I feel much more at peace with myself. I am able to take myself off to my room when I feel too tired to face the world, mainly aided by my fantastically supportive boyfriend, but being able to stop fighting myself, stop trying to force myself into some happy bubbly life I could never live, has made everything so much easier. I'm not saying I'm any less sad, but I am less angry with myself, which is a huge difference. 
The reason for this self-indulgent sharing is that I wish somebody had held my shoulders and suggested that I might be depressed. Not a doctor, or a teacher, but somebody else. So, here I am, telling you that you might be depressed. ",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_vxab8,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/vxab8/how_i_realised_i_was_depressed_as_silly_as_that/,

Here we go.

Timeline
-Live in a small town in ontario since I was 2, no acces to transit, nothing really to do here, a good visually representation of a hole in the ground.

-I was bullied in grade school until i snapped and broke a kid's collar 
bone.

-In highschool I avoided parties, and kept to myself.

-I found an outlet for music, played the flute, joined the band, became first chair and ""band chair"" on our music council.

-looking back being in that room were some of my happiest memories.

-all ended once i graduated.

-had no direction did nothing with myself for a good 6 months until i got job at a new store opening up.

-I worked for 4 years, rent free. so i spent all the money I made.

-at the urging of a friend i applied for college in september of 2010

-applied for OSAP, and in order to be able to live somewhere close to the college a bank loan with my folks as the cosigners.

-The euphoria dwindled after the first month by the second I had a sort of breakdown

-coasted through the rest of the year, failed a few of the courses in my program, didn't care went back home and lived in my room for the rest of the spring and summer

-12,000 dollar in debt after a year, broke, no job, and in a deep black hole of depression and anxiety.

-Stole 150 dollars from my parents to buy some video games in September

-kicked out of house

-disowned by father

-now live with grandma and work as a baker at tim hortons trying to pay down the bank loan we took out (2k to go) still the osap left mind you.

Relationships

-had a handful of friends by the end of grade school, still hung out in high school, but it didn't last.


-the friends i made in high school don't seem to want to be in contact with me.

-Up to a year ago I had 2 friends.

-They aren't my friends anymore.

-Had my first girlfriend in 2010, emotionally abusive relationship, very messed up girl, stuck it out feeling it can get better if I try hard to work everything out. 

-Broke me down, October i didn't leave my bed for a good week.cried for the first time in a long while.

-Cheated on me.

-Forgave her

-Still wanted to be in contact with the guy

-lost my shit and dumped her

-Begged me back said she would get help for her problems

-as an idiot, accepted, one month later same old shit, never went for 
help, cybering, still trying to stay freinds with guy she cheated with.

-Lost all of my shit, blocked her, delted any contact numbers, changed my phone number.

-been a year and 5 months since then, havn't heard from her, I still look back on all that and get sad.

-2 months later tried the dating website thing, got a date, hit it off. MY crazy alarms go off and I adopt a wait and see. After 1 month I realize 2 things, She's crazy and I'm not ready to be in a relationship in the state I'm in. Dumped and it's been 1 year since i've been with a girl. Makes me sad.

Present- Don't feel ready for a relationship, though at the same time I want a SO. Terribley lonely, noone to hang out with.

Behaviors/feelings/thoughts/worries

Anything i haven't covered will go here, kind of a miscellaneous bin

-My mechanism for coping was to hide in my room and play video games/watch tv

-Today it's mostly sleeping and eating that i use to cope, I can't get lost in video games anymore

-i'm 6 foot 3 and 310 pounds. I'm overweight and hate the way i look, this causes me to eat and sleep more to avoid that feeling(lovely cycle)

-Looked for help with depression on november of 2009

-On cipralex for a year and welbutrin added on after my october breakdown max doses.

-Went to the counseling department in college for the rest of the 1st and all of the 2nd semester, scared of what I may have donw if i never went.

-Started public healthcare provided psychiatry in October

-Last month I got a diagnosis

-I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder.[](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder)

-am currently in a group CBT program for the next 8 weeks [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy)

-No longer on any meds.

-and hoping that this CBT will help me move forward in my life without slipping back down into the hole.

To sum up, I don't care about myself or what happens to me, I prefer to sleep eat and/or game my free time away. Hate what i look like but don't care enough to do anything about it, no understanding friends, scared of social situations, afraid of entering another relationship with girl and unsupportive parents. As a I wonder what's the point of it all and what it would be like to just to disappear.


Well, there it is. I left some stuff out I'm sure. It's long enough already. I'm not sure i'm looking for responses or anything of the sort. Possibly I just wished to dump out a wall of text. However, if any of you folks that reached the bottom of this text have anything constructive to contribute, or any questions to clarify what I typed. I will do my best to respond

I live with my now ex-girlfriend.  We dated for 4 years and then things just didn't work out.  I would love to say it was mutual but this was her decision leaving me heart broken.  We are, for the most part, pretty civil about everything though.  She has a boyfriend now of 3 months and I've stayed pretty clear of that and let her live her own life.  
  
Anyway, she sometimes uses my laptop for things because hers is a piece of crap that crashes half the time.  She left a tab open with a forum post on it.  I read it.  I know this is somewhat an invasion of privacy but it was right there in front of me.  In short, her boyfriend apparently already proposed to her and she said yes and she wanted advice on marriage.  She also mentioned how she was going to pack up, leave, and live with him the first chance she gets.  It's besides the point that I think that's jacked up to begin with, but this is where complications kick in.  This is naturally not the most comfortable situation for me and hurtful to watch unfold to say the least.  I cannot afford to move out or live on my own whatsoever.  I just got a new job with a very low pay just to pay the bills.  We moved to a new town semi-recently and I don't know people around here well enough to stay at their houses or crash somewhere.  I've thought about talking to the landlord about some of this but even if I could get out of the lease, I have nowhere to go.  I couldn't pay the fee to break the lease either.  I want nothing to do with her if those 4 years really meant nothing and she's willing to marry this fast after that.  
  

Has anyone gone through something similar?  Any advice would be helpful.  If so, how do I cope for the time I am still living here?  I feel like I'm living a nightmare that I can't escape from.  I'm really at a loss of what to do.  Thanks in advanced!",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_lkqo2,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/lkqo2/stuck_living_with_an_ex/,

I never really have had any luck with these things. Part of my problem is even typing these words out. I'll be lucky to even type a paragraph before I decide it all sounds ridiculous and erase it completely, once again repressing these feelings inside of me. My life has been partly an uphill battle most of the 25 years I have been alive, but my mother has always taught to make the best with what you've got; so I guess you could say I have had a pretty fulfilling life. I've experienced borderline poverty when my family hit rock bottom and we didn't have money for water, electricity, or telephones. My parents both come from ""well to do"", middle-class families and in their primes both achieved college level education, but man did they suck at managing their expenses. On the other end of the spectrum, however, I have experienced luxuries some people only dream of. 

When I was 8 my parents split up, my mom took me and my sister to Maryland with her to live with my Aunt and try to create a new life for ourselves in the states. When I was 9 my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, and as a result I became extremely depressed because I knew the state that my mom was in; out of work and had no health insurance, I was scared I was going to lose the only person that took care of me. She ended up meeting my step dad through the internet ,a few months prior to when she was diagnosed (The AOL 4.0 Days). As a result he asked her to come to California , where he proposed to her and thanks to this she was able to have her cancer treated under his health insurance. After I was 12 years old I had a great childhood, we had moved to California and my quality of life had never been better. My step-dad really helped me integrate into the whole California lifestyle, got me into music heavily, and as if it was almost a California decree I started to play guitar, got pretty good at it too! I invested a lot of time and energy into my music and honestly it was the direction I wanted to go in for a very long time. I'll admit I got into drugs, I shot up cocaine for my last 2 years of high school after I realized it was *the way* to get the drug into my system; I was even loaded on my graduation day. A few months after graduation when I was looking for places with my mom, she noticed track marks all up and down my arm. I usually made a good point to hide them , but for some reason I completely forgot at this point and the fact that she had asked me a few months before what the marks on my arms were lead her to immediately put two and two together. A few days later I was in Rehabilitation and I haven't touched the stuff since. My mom made me go to a Jr. College in Santa Barbara, trying to distance me from my friends, whom she thought were the source of influence, but the reality was that 2 hours wasn't going to keep me away for long. Every chance I had I'd make the drive just to hang out and drink with my buddies. This led me to fail miserably in my first few months of college. After 2 years in Santa Barbara, My mom, already strained financially, told me she couldn't afford me living there anymore and told me to come back home. At this point I realized the pain and torture I had subjected my mother to and honestly started to cool down on my life style. When I moved back to my home town I enrolled in the local community college and had a pretty good semester there, before a house party in the middle of the fucking suburbs ruined my life and self confidence for ever. 

It was St. Patricks day, and After a very long night of partying, people were starting to get a little rowdy. Some people were told to leave and in retalitation they started to destroy property, this in turned led them to call for some ""backup"", which led to me getting a bottle upside my head that also managed to slit my throat clean open. I lost 2 Liters of my blood struggling to keep myself alive. My best friends staring at me in complete fucking terror. The only thing I could think about is how my mom will wake up in the morning to hear the news that her son is dead. I felt so fucking guilty, so fucking unfulfilled and I was so angry. I had been unjustly picked out and targeted, for some stupid fucking kids idea of proving a point. I was so disappointed with my life and this point and wanted nothing more than another chance, my life had been cut short!  But low and behold, I am alive, I survived and because I wasn't completely hammered during the event I managed to get a perfect ID on the kid multiple times as detectives were investigating my case. I knew I had the fucker and honestly wanted him to be put away for a long time, but he only ended up getting 2 years. 

Since then I have moved on with my life and have moved far far away from California, but I still yearn to be there despite me having a good job and education where I currently reside. I graduated college about a year ago with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science, nad have since then earned a real job, bought myself a brand new car, and have a wonderful and loving girlfriend who loves me more than I can even understand. 

But day to day I find myself getting more and more depressed and am at a loss in trying to understand why, but I think I sort of have an idea. I mean I am 25 years old and I have a hugely apparent bald spot and receding hairline. My neck bares the scar almost from ear to ear, but I guess everyone tells me they barely notice it... My weight has been going up steadily since I moved here and honestly it has been bringing me down. But all in all I feel like I shouldn't give a shit about my physical appearance since I have a beautiful girlfriend who loves me very much and honestly is the sweetest girl there is. Anyways I have been wanting to go back home to california for the last 2 years or so , mainly because I had intented to come here, study, and then go back to california with my degree, but my girlfriend has sort of ridden me of any of those plans since she is still studying and has a very strong family value in her household, everyone seems to stick around. Within the last few months my dog in California passed away, and I feel as if I have been Robbed of my best friend, he was only 10 and had a couple extra years to live. My step-dads grandmother also passed away this past month, and honestly it weighs heavily on my heart, that was the sweetest woman I knew and since our last reunion over 6 years ago she had been asking all her grandchildren about my sister and I, we were all she would ever talk about. It brings me down... just thinking about it. My dad has also been deteriorating and it is starting to make me worry about him terribly, he barely keeps in touch with me even though I live 30 minutes from him. My mom has also been going through a lot without me there, and I am typically the one that supports her the most. With the lost of our dog, she has really been depressed and just last week had to undergo a surgery for a Hernia she had. 

Now I am sitting here, trying to cope with everything that has been happening these past few months. I feel trapped here, partly because of my girlfriend, she doesn't seem to be partial to the fact that I honestly want to go back home. This is due to underlying trust issues which would take an entire post to explain why they even exist. My life is honestly a fucking mess I don't know how to deal with. My ability to make friends has since disappeared, I have no true friends here where I live and honestly feel so alone sometimes. My girlfriend has been sort of smothering me lately, and it's getting to the point where I can't deal with it anymore. But then I think about how alone I am, and I become grateful that she is constantly willing to be with me and drive to wherever I am working just to eat lunch with me... It makes me appreciate her... but I feel like it's something I am letting spiral out of control... I honestly am feeling hopeless... my thoughts and ideas of suicide are not solely because it's what comes to my mind as a dramatic end-all, but more so because honestly I feel like it is the most comforting and secure solution. 

I don't know what to do reddit...I dont know what to do world...I dont know if the drugs have affected my rational way of thinking, or if I am just being too hard on myself.... I dont understand why I cant make friends, even my co-workers dont offer to hang out with me , but do talk within eachother... I am not a recluse asshole, I do still have some of the outgoing qualities I had before all the crazy shit in my life happened... but I feel like I get shot down way too easily, and even though I consciously recognize this... I can't for the life of me change it! I feel like my attitude about everything has gone down hill... I just dont know what to do anymore...I also have had a history with self-inflicted wounds and honestly it has started to affect me more now than it did before when I was just a kid ""cutting"" myself. I see the scars all over my arms and legs and I just feel like such a fucked up individual...  now I dont use a knife , I simply punch walls and a few days ago I fractured my knuckle punching my wall after a small argument with my girlfriend... Ughh I am getting tired of talking about myself..

I've been single for a little over a year now. I've never had a fulfilling relationship in my life. I'm 25 years old. Almost everyone I know is married or in a committed relationship or can easily find an SO.


I've meditated, and made lost of friends, and made lots of personality changes, and tried to be happier and pleasant, but I can't get over my feeling that I disgust others, and the dread of dying alone. That I will never have a chance at being in a real relationship, and raising a family. That there will always be so much wrong with me that I should just accept the fact that I will be one of those people that will be Forever Alone.

People keep telling me that 'one day she will come', but I've run out of faith/optimism. I don't know what to do. I can't shake the feeling of being unattractive and undesirable.

Edit: Thanks for all of the responses. I've had a lot of stress building up over the last few days, and it finally exploded when I realized I got to work yesterday and forgot my wallet and phone and had a breakdown.

I haven't gotten up out of this chair since yesterday morning. The only way to describe my mood is neutral. Physically I feel numb all over. 

I just can't get up the enthusiasm to care anymore. The logical side of me is telling me this is a problem but the emotional side of me can't do anything. I don't know why I don't want to do anything. I don't know why I've just given up.

I know I need to call a doctor or something but I can't get up the energy to do it. If someone came here and knocked on the door I wouldn't get up and if the phone rang I wouldn't answer it.

Right now - I have probably over 100 tabs open - it's not always this bad, but it can be, and it doesn't have to be, because it's more than just how many tabs I have open - it's the obsessive, compulsive, and constant/habitual opening of tabs that are extremely more easy to open than close - it's the unfocused, easily distractible (almost ADD-like), overly interested mindset that I have which limits my productivity and time with any given thing/tab, clouds my priorities, further clutters and disorganizes my life and mind, and so forth and so on. I have painfully lost countless tabs because my netbook just couldn't handle the stress I've put on it, and I have a countless amount of saved/recovered tabs and bookmarks that I'll probably never be able to get to - I'm sure I'll just have to delete a vast majority of them and move on, despite the dismayed and distraught hoarder inside of me.

I'm not sure if this is indicative of a deeper root issue in my life or mental health, and it very well could be, or if I can address this directly.

I'm a 20 year old male who enjoys guns/beer/man stuff etc. as well as the notebook and being open with people such and such. This is not be asking to be less girly but to be able to control my emotions when I need to. 

My problem is when I need to confront someone about how I feel about them or if they treated me with a bit of disrespect I begin to tear up and end up becoming a blubbering mess towards that end. 

For example, I started to work at Home Depot as a cashier. When I went to the returns desk there will be conflict between the customer wanting to return an unreasonable item and me denying them. Well that very thin happened. The customer wanted to return an expensive wall plate. I say expensive because wall plates are usually between 59 cents to a 99 cents. This one was a specialty plate that cost 7 bucks a pop. It was snapped in half and he said that he didn't want it anyone. Obviously I denied the return and he became angry, wanting to speak to a manager and such. I told him there wasn't any reason to call a manger because he will repeat what I already told you. So the customer became pissed, chucked the plate on the floor shattering the plate, and walked away. He startled me with his rage and I began to just cry. He scared me, my co-worker asked what was going on. I was about to explain but the thought of talking about it brought on the water works. This happened about a year ago. 

A little more background. After a while I moved from being a cashier to becoming an floor associate in the paint department. Also for that last 6 months I was only working three days a week, Friday - Sunday because I wanted to focus on school. Today is the first Monday I worked in about 4-5 months. 

This next event happened today maybe about an hour ago. Our store is restoring some wooden signs for city hall. We stripped it, sanded, refinished and are currently in the process of painting the words in. I opened up the department and did everything I usually did on the weekends because its more or less the same routine. Except I had forgotten that the department gets scanned for outs and needs to be addressed Monday morning. We call it ""pack-down"". Well I forgot to do the departments pack-down and began working on the sign. My supervisor walks up to me and asks why I didn't address the pack-downs for this morning. I told her I had forgotten and will do them right now. She responded with ""this is retail, it doesn't change. Same thing every day."" But in a really demeaning put-down sort of way. I wanted to tell her that I appreciate you reminding me but didn't you need to make it sound like I was wasting time and goofing off. That this was the first Monday in 4-5 months that I had worked. It just slipped my mind. But just the thought of talking to her brought tears to my eyes and I had to walk away from her out of embarrassments. 

What I guess I'm asking is how do I control my emotions/not cry when I want to confront someone about how I feel or about what just occurred. Also is this a normal thing? Or am I just being a big baby about what's going on and just need to ""toughen up""?

Also, if you gotten this far, thank you for your time. Sorry for the wall of text. I'm on alien blue at work typing this up. I tried to space out the paragraphs for a bit of ease for you guys. Again, thank you.

I'm not very comfortable expressing these feelings to anyone in real life so I'm turning to you guys.  

Happiness just seems so far away to me right now.  It seems like everyone around me is getting married, starting a family, advancing in their careers, and generally doing the things I thought I would be doing at this age (29/m).  All of my close friends are married or in long term relationships, so I don't have a close group of friends to confide in like I used to.  When I do go out, it's usually with acquaintances I know from work or old college buddies but I feel like I'm an outsider who is just hanging with their group.

A lot of the advice I'm probably going to receive is going to be something along the lines of how I need to learn to be comfortable with myself, which I honestly feel like I am.  I think pretty highly of myself, I have a job in my field,  I have hobbies, interests and aspirations.  I go to the gym 5 times a week and get out of the house as much as I can but nothing seems to fill the void.  I think what I really want is to be a part of something and/or be accepted, which goes against the advice of most people on here and other self help forums.  I know that you shouldn't need to seek the approval of others but I feel like that's exactly what would make me happy.  How can I learn to be happy being alone when I feel like being alone is what is making me unhappy?

I'm really good at pretending I'm happy.  If you and I were to hang out this weekend, you'd probably never guess it's me writing all of this.  I'm good at socializing and meeting new people.  I make people laugh and even get a decent amount of attention from girls.  One girl who I went on a few dates with even said she was attracted to me because of how at peace and balanced I seemed.  I remember laughing inside my head and thinking how I consider my self to be quite the opposite.  

I get really frustrated with myself because I know there are people who are much worse off than I am and it almost makes me feel like I'm being pathetic.  I almost feel guilty because I have everything I could possibly need and there are people who would kill to have what I have, and here I am complaining about being unhappy.  It's like I'm a tortured soul for no apparent reason.  What the hell is my deal?

Emotionally, I'm kind of a wreck. I'm halfway done with an undergrad degree but I'm still ridiculously naive. I get overly attached in relationships, because every one I've been in so far has ended with the other person inadvertently leaving me to go travel or be with someone else. I feel like if I don't hold on to the other person then they'll disappear like the others did, which I'm sure pushes them further away.
My interests are almost nonexistent. The only thing I really like are video games, but I have an unhealthy relationship with them. I only play them to escape from reality when I'm unsatisfied, which doesn't help the problem at all. The music I listen to is all generic pop music that I don't really like all that much. But I don't know where to start with new sounds. I want to read more, but I don't know where to find decent cheap books at and I can't stand libraries, unless I already know exactly what I'm looking for.
In conversation, I'm not so horrible. I can do well in large groups where I only need to carry part of a conversation but in smaller settings I freeze. I draw blanks or over think what I want to say, and it kills conversation. I never know how to start a conversation after that either, which usually ends in an awkward silence.
I have almost no really useful skills. I can boil water and take care of someone with a flu or stomach virus, but not much else. I'd like to learn how to help with a wider variety of things like anxiety, open wounds, broken limbs, etc. I'm not looking to master any of these things but I'd like to know where to start just in case they come up. I can't really build anything except a computer (which is really just a few simple screws and plugs, so nothing too complex) and I'd probably die of dehydration or exposure if I ended up lost in the woods alone one day.

I am a 23 year old college student in my fifth and final year.  I am a philosophy major which I now regret but I want to finish it so that I can at least have a bachelors degree.  I do not know what I want to do with my life as far as career is concerned.  I have been in a relationship with a girl for 5 years and i was weeks away from proposing to her when she broke up with me about 3 weeks ago.  We lived together and had a cat together and this has been extremely hard on me.  I was forced to move out of my apartment and I moved in with a friend recently.

The point of this post however is my lack of motivation.  Even long before the break up I had become so bad about procrastination on my school work that I almost always turn things in late if at all.  If I have a large assignment or paper hanging over my head I will avoid going out with my friends and doing fun things because I ""Have to do homework"" and then I will spend the entire night online just procrastinating and dicking around on the internet.  Every half hour I will tell myself ""in just one more half an hour I have to start my homework or I am FUCKED"" and this continues often until I have to go to school.  I get hardly anything done and I don't get hardly any sleep.   My homework just piles up as I keep putting it off.

This being my final semester, there are obviously a lot of assignments I need to complete.  I am in the Honors in Discipline program in philosophy at my school so I am expected to write a 30 page thesis paper by the end of the semester and present it.  I have told my professor so many times that I would have a completed paper for him and I have gotten almost no where on the paper.

I thought that the change of pace of moving out of my apartment and in with my friend might give me a chance to really buckle down and do my homework, but i still find myself every night hating myself and feeling like an idiot because I just can't seem to do all of this homework that I so desperately need to finish.  I often skip classes just because I am so embarrassed to see my teachers without anything in my hands.  I can't be the only one who sits up at night fretting to the point of being mentally paralyzed about projects.  I guess i just don't handle pressure well.  This has to stop though.  It is putting a huge strain on me mentally and I worry every day that I won't graduate because I just can't make myself do anything.  Please help me somehow.  I don't know what I will do if I fail in my final months of college.  I have to stop this procrastination.

I'm having overwhelming rage related to failed relationships and the associated feelings of abandonment and betrayal, set against a backdrop of flat-lining respect at work, still-incomplete divorce, the effects of advancing age, and with alcohol aggravating most aspects of the situation.

The rage has surfaced sporadically over the last several weeks, since I got dumped from a two-year relationship (a relationship that made problems in other areas of my life bearable).

It's gotten so bad that I took several days off from work to wander around the house screaming ""fucking cunt"" and ""fuck you"" and ""fuck you all"", ""fuck this planet"", and a nice ""fuck it all"" out my front door this morning, much to the horror of my cat.

Until a few days ago the occasional screaming felt like an indulgence to help get the break-up out of my system, but lately I've felt it's starting to take control of me (or, more accurately, to become me).

Basically I'm here as a possibly-more-constructive alternative to taking another shrieking walk around the house.  I don't think I would snap in the sense of hurting others, but I could see myself taking insanely ill-advised personal or ""professional"" decisions if I can't address the voracious frustration and seething anger inside me.

I've sampled some reddits, and perhaps /r/bpd is the place for me, but I'm not sure.  Of course, /r/rage and even /r/realrage are reserved for comics.

The obvious answer is to seek some kind of psychological help, but my two very brief encounters with this (for not-really-related reasons) were extremely uncomfortable and not at all for me and I probably would not pursue it again, at least not at this point.

Thoughts, comments, suggestions...?

Do not worry that I'll receive this as treatment - basically I would just appreciate some discussion on these kinds of issues based on personal experience or professional knowledge.

**TL;DR: Older guy with relationship, professional, rapidly spiraling rage, and alcohol problems seeks insights, advice, and/or direction.**

Edit 1/16: Thanks to those who have replied.  I have ratcheted down somewhat from my state four days ago, though I still have bouts of anger that I cannot fully suppress.  I will also reply individually to those who were good enough to post a message to me here.

I have noticed a few things:

* Meditation, for a minimum of 20 minutes, does help get my mind to a ""neutral"" state from which it's possible to act independent of my rage.
* Exercise helps substantially if it's intense enough to really ""feel it"", whether strength or endurance oriented.
* Maintaining a full, detailed schedule each day and focusing on being on time and getting things done helps provide at least the illusion that my circumstances are improving, helping my mental state.
* Seemingly small things can have major effects on my mood - for example, if I'm active in an online discussion in which I appear to be doing well, or run into someone I'm friendly with and we have a good time together, my mood is much better for awhile.  On the other hand, if I sense that I'm being slighted or put off by someone whose attention is important to me, it can set off some raging.
* I really, really need to keep my ex off my mind.  She's very attractive (especially to me perhaps) and seeing her photos can set me off.  I deleted her photos from my phone and I'm doing my best to avoid her various online profiles.
* Alcohol is going to be very tricky, because it can cause major setbacks in the above positive efforts, but it has a dominant role in my few social activities - and regardless of the underlying causes that have been suggested in the comments, it's the loss of my relationship that I feel most acutely.

Going through these observations, I can see that some problems have been identified, and some possible solutions are implied as well.  It will take me awhile to put this together, probably piece by piece, but it's something.  I know I have some obstacles to making positive changes - among them, resistance to the very notion of making conscious changes to myself, and some skepticism about the possibility of doing so.  I do hope I can make incremental changes, though, see some benefit, and be motivated to continue.

Thanks again for your insights.

Just to give you some background, I am almost 16, heading into my junior year. Over the course of the summer, I have come to realize that I really don't care about anything. The outcome of anything is not an issue for me, be it bad or good. I don't expect anything out of people, or out of life. For god's sake, I haven't even really liked a girl in a year. And that scares the hell out of me. It scares me because growing up, I was always this optimistic kid. I always thought that I had something to offer to the world, something good to say, and that I would grow up to be a good person and change the world. When I pictured myself as a 16 year old, I didn't see this. What I saw was a happy, positive and proactive person who is likable to everybody. Somebody who has a sense of purpose and direction. 
I have three months until I am 16, and I am not that person. In fact, I have no goddamn clue what the hell I am. I've been told that I need to get out and try stuff, but I just can't find the motivation. Also, I haven't had feelings for anybody since this girl in the 9th grade. Since then I have had a couple of girlfriends and casual flings, but I just haven't had any strong feelings for anybody. All I feel is indifference about everything. I'm giving myself three months to shape up, but I don't know where to start, and what to do, and how to motivate myself. How can I light a fire under myself? I'm tired of having ""epiphanies"", starting to get my shit together and then getting lazy and just falling into the same old shit. Help me guys.

She was chronically sick as a baby. Villagers and doctors alike didn’t think she would survive. But she did, even as a baby she fought to live. She wanted to experience this new world she was brought into. 
 
At the young age when she was learning to read and write, add and subtract, and tie her own shoe lace, she was also trying to figure out something dark and scary that was happening to her at night. She would wake up naked. Many questions like, “Did I undress myself while I was sleeping?” and “how did I get to this part of the house?” would cross her mind. She was confused for years and thought that there was something wrong with her at the time. Until one night, she was awoken in her sleep and found her step grandfather on top of her. Scared, confused and barely awake she quickly closed her eyes and told herself that it was a bad nightmare. Like most kids, they close their eyes when they want something to disappear. She woke up later to find what she thought was vomit, at the time, all over her crotch area. Her step grandfather ejaculated all over her private area and she was too young to even know what it was.

She grew up in a sexually, physically and emotionally abusive household. When she was about 12 to 13 years old, her own father attempted to kill her with a knife. He raised the knife in the air, over is head, while she took cover on her bed and begged for her life. “Daddy please don’t hurt me”, she cried over and over. Like a mad man he stabbed the knife into her bed mattress over and over and over again. She went into shock when she saw how close she came to being killed. Her father was puncturing the bed just a few inches away from her body. “Did he miss intentionally?”, she wondered. She survived yet another life threatening situation. When she was about 14, her dad lost it again. This time he took a loaded gun and pointed it directly at her head, while her mother frozenly watched. Tired of the constant beating, she gave up and told him, “go ahead, shoot”. She closed her eyes and awaited her death. Thankfully, her eyes didn’t stay shut permanently. Her dad came to his senses and walked away. 

At this point, she started giving up on her own life. She attempted to take her own life. She started having a total disregard for her life and her future. Nothing mattered anymore because she was going to die soon, she thought. She tried cutting her wrist and taking bottles of pills. But yet she survived even her own attempt to kill herself. 

That little girl was ME. After many unsuccessful attempts to kill myself, something shifted inside of me. I realize that it wasn’t my time yet and I wasn’t going to let anyone get the best of me.  I wanted to LIVE, to LEARN, to GROW and to LOVE. So I decided to fight for the life that I wanted.  I was so imprisoned by my past and I realize that the only way to free myself from that bondage was to forgive and free my heart of any hate or resentments. I eventually forgave my parents.  Since then, I’ve observed how the power of forgiveness transformed our lives. The thing is, I always loved them and I never stopped. All I wanted was for them to Love me too. So I had to be the bigger person. I realize that every good person has a breaking point and is capable of something bad and vise versa. 

I am now in my 30’s. I’ve grown physically, mentally and spiritually. I learned forgiveness, compassion and the meaning of unconditional love, I traveled all over the world and I loved with all my heart. I am living the life I want and I will continue to fight for the happiness that we all deserve. I am sharing my story, hoping that it would inspire you to never give up and continue fighting for the life you want. I especially want to reach out to all the teens contemplating suicide. Trust me, it gets better. Stay strong and don’t let life get the best of you. Give life your best and live to watch it transform into something beautiful.

For the past 10 years I've essentially been doing the same thing.  Going to work and spending my free time playing games, browsing the internet and such.  Basically things that don't improve me, would be one way of putting it.

I haven't even finished high school, don't have any friends, and I just don't have any plans for the future.  There seems to be a part of me that wants to do something, yet I can't get the motivation to do it.  I've been lurking the various motivational subreddits for months, but it hasn't helped.

I've barely achieved much of anything in my life.  I was always a poor student (C average), yet always told I was smart.  According to a study I've seen posted around here, I know now that being told you're smart all your life does lead to kids not putting much effort into things (Paraphrasing here, I don't have a link to the study).  Despite this I've always had motivational problems even in the few things I'm actually interested in.  I have many things left unfinished and I just can't get around to doing them.

I've never actually talked to anyone about this (Fear is the main reason, and I guess it's embarrassing for me too), but online is easy since it's anonymous.  I'm 24 and don't exactly have a stable job, and it feels like I'm going to run out of time soon.  If I lose my job I don't really know how I'll get another one as my current work is due to connections my parents had.

The other issue I deal with a lot is depression and wanting to just kill my self.  I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 11 and I have attempted hanging my self a few years ago.  The only thing that stopped me was that it would make my family sad and I don't want to put them through that.  Otherwise I'd just like to disappear.  

I really don't know what to do anymore and feel like I'm nearing the edge of a cliff.  I've tried going back to school a few times but I end up feeling ashamed.  Even if I did finish my adult grad, I wouldn't even know what to do next.  I've always heard about getting a car, a house, a good job, and a loving wife and having kids.  Yet, it seems like I don't even want those things either.  I could buy a car, rent out an apartment or something, I can afford those things.  If I were to go to university or college, I don't even know what for.  I've been thinking about a future career since I was 13 and still haven't figured it out.  

Relationships are something I completely missed out on since I left high school when I was 13 since I just didn't fit in.  I ended up doing at home correspondence school, but I failed that completely.  Because of that I never learned how to be with girls, but overall I've never had the desire to have sex or be in a relationship in the first place.

I think overall I hate my self for not being like other people.  I look at my brother and sister, their friends, and my old classmates.  I see them driving around, living on their own, working towards whatever dream or goals they have, and most are in some kind of relationship.  I on the other hand have barely moved forward.

Sorry for making this so long, but I guess it feels kind of nice to at least type this out.  I also apologize for any grammar/spelling/comprehension mistakes, I'm just not in a good mood.

I basically came here because I was tired of /r/getmotivated

I've been lurking over /r/selfhelp lately as I'm a big fan of self improvement. Good for me, as there is an awful lot of material on the Internet. A lot you say ? Too much in fact.

Recently, I saw that most posts are just links to blogs talking about self improvement, and for a significant part of them, you can see through the username that these are merely self-promotional posts.

Some of these articles are so unoriginal that I wonder if the writer just copy/paste the article from one site to another, and I'm starting to get tired of it.

I think that /r/selfhelp should be more than a bunch of links to website with nice stock-photos of happy people and a dotted list of advices you have already read 100 times.

This also leads to a lot of posts having no comments, and it feels quite empty over here...

Maybe it should be more about personal experience. Ok you can post a link to an article you thought was insightful, but tell us in which way it helped you, from where did you start (depressed, good but lacking something, meh ?), where did it bring you (happiness, enlightenment, meh ?).

This might lead to interesting discussions between redditors.

Anyway, I wish this community would act more as a filter to sort out what's really good, what's really innovative. It might also be a place for beginners (Self improvement is a huge field. Where do I start ? How about a FAQ ?) and for advanced user that are feeling stuck, although they know the basics.

Well, that was just my opinion. What do you think ? (Mods?)

I find myself just going through the motions, and it's really damn depressing. This... insecurity, for lack of a better word- is starting to affect me in all aspects of my life.

My schoolwork is suffering because I procrastinate too much to get it done. I have an inability to organize and face my problems that is getting to the level of crippling. I feel like I'm just not there, mentally, and I can't figure out how to snap out of it.

Any ideas on what to do?",15,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/m54z2/xpost_from_ranxiety_wtf_brain_i_have_been/,"I suffer from a sheer sense of terror that my life will fall apart any minute because I did something wrong somehow that will soon cause my own negative fate, or that I have to accomplish things now-now-now or else all will fall apart. Even during times when things had been relatively stable, I still have had that problem.

I've learned some smart ways to calm the anxiety, certain meditation things, breathing exercises, some visualizations, etc. I also have some meds.

However whenever I get calmer from doing those things, ANGER shows up, bigtime.

When I get calm, or even decide on an intent to get calm, some part of me gets ANGRY, believing that I am deliberately leaving it alone, that I am ignoring it and shutting it away.

I can feel the anger, the sense of being shut out and alone, the sense of ""What the hell, you aren't going to care about what I am feeling at all?"" so intensely whenever I do the anti-anxiety exercises.

Even the thought of INTENDING to do something to calm the anxiety brings on this feeling. Thinking of taking my anti-anxiety pills, thinking of doing exercise, thinking of organizing my life so that things are easier to deal with, thinking of ideas for having more friends... ANY kind of calm-inducing intent brings on this deep inner despair, aloneness and anger.

I only recently have figured out that this is what is happening. Before then, I just had a hell of a lot of overwhelm.

My anger self believes that if I am NOT completely obsessing over the horrible things that could happen and the things I should, I am viciously shutting it out. That makes for some real sadness and depression in the mix.

That chunk of me feels that I am only sufficiently dealing with life if I am full of anxiety about all the stuff I have to do and all the horrid things that could happen. It's like that part of me which **feels validated only when I am freaked out,** because it feels like it's concerns are only being felt and acknowledged by my being freaked out.

(Ironically, being freaked out means that I am not very functional, so from an objective point of view, I am NOT dealing with things very well and my life falls apart worse.)

This is the first time I've ever been able to articulate what's going on with this aspect of my anxiety.

I guess the fact that I am crying a little must be helping... when I was a kid, I was beat up and abused for crying because ""making that damn noise"" was very rage-triggering to the people who raised me.

I have been in therapy off and on for about 20 years. I have now found a great therapist who actually has a clue, but unfortunately I can't afford her fees. Damn, that sucks.

Thanks for listening and for any wisdom anyone might have to offer.

I've been having this issue since I was a toddler of crying for the most minor thing ever, like getting yelled at by a teacher. When I watch everyone else get yelled at, they don't show any tears whatsoever. But when I get yelled at, my cheeks start to turn pink/red and hot and my eyes start watering. It's very embarrassing, and at the same time, I really want to fix this. I want to avoid getting yelled at, so I try not to make any mistakes... and the second I do, the tears come back.


[I have this teacher who pulled me out of class one day to talk to me about my behavior. I do agree that I was being disrespectful for not responding to him, but I cried anyways. I have no idea why, but it just happened. He then said (exact quote) ""Why are you crying? There's no reason to cry."" This made me angry and made me want to cry even more.)

Is it because I feel like I receive a lot of attention (from the class) (I don't like attention like this)? Is it because my teacher reminds me a lot about my father (who I dislike)? Is it because crying became an involuntary reaction? Is it because I wanted him to understand that I wasn't having a great day or that I wasn't a morning person, but I didn't know how to tell him?


I also start tearing up from being told that my answer is wrong in front of a class. (Background info: when I was in elementary school, I happened to be educationally ahead of everyone else, and so everyone expected me to answer all questions correctly. Most of the time I met their expectations, but sometimes I'd answer a question wrong here and there; happens to everybody. When I answered a question wrong, I'd start tearing up because I can hear people say ""Oh my god [mikunegi] made a mistake~"" ""Wow THAT [mikunegi] made a mistake?!"" ""Woahh no way she answered that wrong, even I knew the right answer."") Well now that it's high school, I don't really hear people say this anymore, but those voices still ring in my head involuntarily.


I think this one's pretty common, but I cry when I get mad. I don't have to be EXTREMELY angry, just mildly angry and my eyes start watering. I assume that people only cry when they're angry when it's something that really bothers them. Is what I consider 'mildly angry' actually something that is 'extremely angry' by the majority?



As I'm typing this, I'm thinking that part of the reason why I cry so much is because it's an involuntary action. What do you guys/girls think? Why do I cry so easily? What can I do to control my tears?",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_1cz3n3,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1cz3n3/how_can_i_stop_crying_so_easily/,

I will be ranting because I have no vision/direction for what the final outcome should be. I just need at least one person to help. 









I have always thought deeply about myself and my thoughts. I started high school 2 years early, and made a science out of socializing. I will train myself to think a certain way, and whenever I had a positive outcome I would then be rewarded. Even if someone came to talk to me or high fived me, then I would feel incredibly good. This is my 2nd year of college, first year in dorms, first year away from family and alone. I will not explain to you all the thoughts I have been having; it would take just way too long. If you want to really know where I am at, message me or just ask in the comments. I am now at the point where I realized I need to convince myself that the way people look at me and what the current situation I am looks like does not matter. Every situation I am in (walking to class, eating in caf, sitting in someone's dorm) I will think, ""what does this look like to people on reddit, what does this look like to the person I am talking to, what are the people in the cafeteria thinking, etc..."" Most of the time I end up discourage and stressed out and confused on what to think next. 

I need to stop thinking about what these things look like from 10 different perspectives. I am now at this point because for too long I didn't know if this ""ability"" could be useful or not. I think it still could be, but I am getting nowhere and not healthily interacting with people. I do not connect with them at all; I am not normally socialized. I have tried for about a week to try and stop thinking about these things and replace them with healthy thoughts and directions. 

**Here are my problems:**

* I cannot get myself to think differently. I have absolutely no idea how to stop thinking that way; no idea how to go about it. **I need to stop worrying about it, don't know how to.**

* I have no idea what I should replace these thoughts with. Healthy ones, normal ones for people in my situation, yes. **In each situation I have no way of knowing what I should be thinking about.**

I really need help; I need direction, perspective, actually just someone who has experience with changing the way they think. Socializing and interaction are so important that changing this apart about me is worth it.

My name's Brian Newton, and I'm just finishing up my doctorate in Clinical Psychology. I have a background in web development and as part of my degree, I'm conducting a research project that involves creating an interactive self-help website for perfectionism. The website is of course entirely free, I just need people to give the program a try and any feedback you give is massively helpful. This is intended to be a pilot study on whether or not people find this sort of thing helpful and how it might be improved. Just as a side note, it's intensive, involves 4-5 surveys up front and after and involves some introspection, so be prepared if you're interested. What follows is my formalized recruitment script. This is my first time opening up the site to the public, so please, if you run into any issues with the site feel free to e-mail me at the e-mail below. Thanks everyone and I hope some people find it helpful!

""Do you struggle with feeling pressured to perform tasks perfectly? Do you feel like other people expect a lot from you and that they won’t be happy unless you perform to a very high level? I’ve created a website called “Perfectionism Self Help” as part of a research project to gather information on whether people find an online program of this nature helpful, and as part of the requirements for me to complete a graduate program in clinical psychology at Alliant International University. It involves a specially designed program containing information and exercises that include exploring one’s values, looking at the way perfectionism gets in the way of who one wants to be and different ways to potentially help perfectionism be less of a difficulty in one’s life. The website is entirely free and requires only some basic demographic information, a password and e-mail which will be used solely for the website to send reminders related to the activities in the program. The program involves a significant amount of introspection and potentially time, so please only sign up if you intend to complete the program. For more information, please visit the site at [http://www.perfectionismselfhelp.com/](http://www.perfectionismselfhelp.com/) and/or contact me by e-mail at admin@perfectionismselfhelp.com.

Thank you.

-       We all worry far too much.

-       We are too critical of ourselves and others.

-       Too many of us judge others then make a comparison to ourselves.

-       We spend our lives concerned by what others think of us.

I often feel like everybody else has this amazing personality, and I have to try to be more cheerful or funnier to be a better personality to be around. 

I usually know I have to stop and reframe my mind. But it's a never ending cycle or good self confidence, then lows, then build it back up with some self improvement work with myself.

I'm in a monogamous relationship with my amazing boyfriend. We speak about marriage and children all the time. Obviously we have no set plans, as I'm still deep into university and he is only going to graduate this April (he's 24). And it breaks my heart everyday knowing that I'm going to have to tell him that, NO, I can't bear your children and, NO, I could never be that wife you want me to be. 

I've had Endometriosis since I was 14. It started off as nothing, not pain, not severe at all. My family didn't think much of it because my mom has it as well and has never really affected her. So I turned down the laparoscopy that may have helped. Fast forward 5 years, and I am riddled with pain every time I make love, every period, everything. My back is always in pain and so many days I can hardly get out of bed. So I went to the gyno.

After a regular checkup, a few ultrasounds, etc etc, she asks me if I've ever had ovarian cysts. I tell her yes, I have, many times. I've ended up in the ER before at least 4 times because of the pain. She gives me this pained look. She tells me my fallopian tubes are damaged. I asked her what this means.

She tells me that the combination of cysts and and Endo have made my lady bits useless. 

Basically, here's my situation:
The highest chance I'll ever have to conceive would be now, as it's only going to get worse. If I were to have the laparoscopy now, MAYBE, for a SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, there's a SLIGHT CHANCE I could get pregnant.

You see where I'm going with this.

I'm 19. I'm in school. I'm a financial dud.
It's just not an option.

I know, adoption is an option and all that jazz. But I am the mother type, the thought of being pregnant is beautiful to me.. All that corny stuff.

The issue is, I never leave the house.

It is seriously defeating and it feels automatic.

[Slightly NSFW]",14,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1fmtyv/feeling_like_ive_gone_downhill_lately_any_advice/,"**A few contextual details before I begin will follow. As long as this post will be, I feel that it is necessary to discuss my background before I get to my problem. I'm doing my best to explain everything clearly. I highly recommend that you read this section to better understand where I'm coming from, but I'm obviously not requiring you to read it. Cross-posted to r/anxiety**

First, I'm a twenty-something girl. I'm currently taking Prozac (60mg) and Wellbutrin for my anxiety. My psychiatrist recently increased the dosage on the latter prescription from 150mg to 300mg. I've struggled with clinical anxiety and depression since I was thirteen years old. I also have a history of obsessive-compulsive behaviors. I'm a total perfectionist.

Secondly, I truly applaud and appreciate anyone who does respond to my post. I know how incredibly complex my anxiety and paranoia is, as it's very deeply embedded in my mind from childhood and adolescent experiences (especially family-related events) and therefore it's sometimes very difficult or frustrating for anyone to offer advice and/or console me. I grew up in an emotionally (and sometimes physically) abusive, dysfunctional home. My parents are extremely negative people who raised me to believe I'm nothing but an unkind, horrible person who deserves equally horrible treatment from others and an awful life. 

I'm not close with my family at all; they haven't expressed affection or have told me they love me since I was a really young child. Their attitudes towards me were further reinforced in my first few relationships with men; my first ""serious"" boyfriend emotionally abused and manipulated me for roughly a year and a half before I broke up with him. My next two boyfriends were not class acts either. I've been cheated on multiple times. I'm currently in my first healthy, serious relationship with an amazing guy who has stood by me even during my lowest moments. We've been going out for nearly a year. This is the first relationship in which I've seriously contemplated a future with the other person (obviously not in the near future, however).

For the record, I just graduated with my bachelor's degree. I'm heading to graduate school this fall. I'm a high-achieving student who is very well-respected by my peers and instructors. I also work two outside jobs to earn my own income.

**What I'm currently struggling with:**

* I feel like I've hit an emotional slump for the past month. I can't seem to get back on my feet. I've been more paranoid and emotional than usual. On days that I don't work, I tend to sleep in until about noon. I've noticed that I haven't eaten as healthy as I should either. I don't know if this is just ""leftover"" stress from pre-graduation obligations and finals week, but it's really eating away at me. Perhaps I'm not getting enough ""me"" time or I'm not comfortable with being away from my friends and my boyfriend to enjoy ""me"" time every once in a while? I can't really piece it together.

* My confidence has ebbed and flowed this past semester. I was on a good confidence streak for quite some time, but recently started going downhill. Every time I hang out with my friends/boyfriend, I'm constantly analyzing my behavior and beating myself up if I don't act ""perfectly"" or like a ""normal"" person would. I also interpret their actions and behaviors from an unnecessarily pessimistic lens (e.g. My boyfriend says he loves me before hanging up the phone, I'll question if he really meant it or not, said it just to satisfy me, etc.); I can't snap out of this mindset. For instance, I'm ""convinced"" that my friends and boyfriend think I'm a bad person, and are ashamed of me and the fact that I have anxiety/depression. I don't entirely understand how I can be fair, assertive, and objective when I conduct research and when inside the classroom, and yet be so cynical and irrational outside of those contexts. I'll try my best to employ techniques that I've been taught in therapy, but it seems like my ""default"" emotion is ""set"" at cynicism/pessimism To illustrate, trying to reach a decent level of optimism lately has been like trying to get an old car to start. I don't know what's going on, as I was doing completely alright just a little over a month ago.

* I'm scared that the good things in my life (friends, boyfriend, etc.) will be taken away from me in some catastrophic way. For example, my boyfriend is currently working on getting his motorcycle license. Ever since he started the process to getting it, I constantly worry that ""the end is near"" and that he'll either be killed or seriously injured out on the road unless I'm a ""perfect"" girlfriend. He isn't a reckless person, but I'm scared of other drivers hurting him. When hanging out, I have these scary thoughts of ""...you better enjoy these last few months with him..."" and so forth. I equally worry that I ""deserve"" that level of trauma in my life. As much as others tell me I'm a sweet and caring person, I'm absolutely terrified that I'm an inherently evil, terrible person.

* I've become increasingly ""clingy"" in my interpersonal relationships. I've been feeling lonely lately despite the fact that I've gone out quite a bit since graduation and see my friends/boyfriend on a regular basis. If someone can't meet up on a particular day, I've noticed I've been taking the ""rejection"" very personally and as confirmation of their ""dislike"" towards me. I tend to play games with myself such as backing away from my friends/boyfriend for a bit, and letting them come to me and make plans rather than the other way around. If I ""break"" my silence (so to speak), I beat myself up for being too ""clingy"" and ""needy."" What is going on here? Again, I was doing just fine not too long ago; I was balanced and rational. I feel like I've lost that mindset.

**[Warning: next part NSFW]**

* Regarding my relationship and sex life, I haven't been able to ""perform"" very well lately. My boyfriend is the first guy I've been with that has had me reach orgasm via penetration (obviously, I can easily get off in other ways). Ever since this first happened, I've noticed that it has become part of how I view myself and my own femininity. I haven't been able to reach orgasm via penetration for the past month and it's wearing me down. I feel like less of a woman. I don't feel beautiful, graceful, or romantic when I either can't achieve orgasm period or when I have to use another method to get there. While my boyfriend assures me it's fine and that it happens every now and then, I worry that he'll get frustrated and either 1) leave me, or 2) cheat on me. The latter situation is incredibly out of character for him (he's the kind of guy who wouldn't hurt a flea), but I'll still get thoughts/worries of it happening. Obviously, my own personal frustration isn't necessarily helping the situation any further; if anything, it's going to deter me from reaching orgasm. I always think ""it will happen next time"" when it doesn't happen, and feel like a failure when I can't get off. I don't want my boyfriend to feel like he can't get me off. I had a mini meltdown the other day when I couldn't get off. My sex life is a very special and romantic part of my relationship. How can I just relax and let an orgasm happen again?

**[End NSFW part]**

Again, I really appreciate those who took the time to read everything in this post. I did my best to make it as thorough as possible for you to understand what I've been going through. I'm finding it very difficult to get back up on my feet lately, and I don't know how to approach my current dilemmas. It's becoming tiresome and frustrating. How can I assure my friends/boyfriend that they haven't done anything to hurt or disappoint me? Moreover, how can I tell them how to react and approach my current stress?

I would be extremely grateful for any encouragement or general advice.

**TL;DR: Fell into an anxiety/paranoia slump and don't know how to relax and get back up again. Convinced my [otherwise extremely kind] friends and boyfriend hate me.

However I had a very good network of friends back home that I had built up over a long time and now that is all gone so the problem is much more apparent.

Apparently I ""don't know when to stop talking""

To me silence feels unnerving in any situation where other people are in the room (to the point it is absolutely unbearable and I will say just about anything I can think of just to fill the void). Background music or being really tends to fix this but not always. 

People say that I explain things past where I need too and that it comes off as forceful. This ends up in many conversations where other people get defensive and begin to argue with me then consider me to have been looking for an argument or to have started it when I had absolutely not intention of arguing (and sometimes didn't even realize it was an argument). Also I find it hard to tell if people are interested in what I am talking about.

I feel that this is a slightly different problem but when I get really excited about pretty much anything my volume goes way up and I don’t realize it one bit (probably because I’m too caught up being exited with what I’m excited about).

In an odd way I notice that many of my friends admit that they didn't like me when they first met me but then learned to get by/ignore my quirks, on the flipside I notice that I easily make great first impressions with girls I am interested in but it never goes any further (I'd guess this has something to do with my mannerisms).

As an aside, this problem reminds me a lot of when I was in elementary school and was told to not talk back, to which I responded ""what is talking back?"" to which they said to not talk back and that I was talking back more. Eventually I got my parents to explain this to me and it was solved. Anyway often when one of my friends alerts me that I am doing something wrong and I ask what I am doing wrong or try to figure it out they usually exasperatedly say ""you're doing it again"" or try to end the conversation so I am finding it very hard to solve this. I have also had some very good friends in the past try and give me advice in this regard but I didn't comprehend much of it (I know I can be a bit thick skulled with these things). Anyway I thought I might as well try asking Reddit.

tl;dr
I naturally talk to the point or in a way that other people find me very annoying and I find it very uncomfortable/difficult when I try and fix this. Looking for other people who have gone through the same thing or just some genuine advice.

Since then, I've worked anywhere from 70 to 110hrs per week almost every week (salaried, exempt) for a startup company, trying to get our product off the ground.

Finally, I'm feeling what I can only describe as ""burned out"". I don't love what I do anymore (and I certainly used to). I don't have interests in anything at home anymore either. Video games that used to hold my attention feel like a chore to play. I can't watch movies because I prefer multi-tasking; playing Flash games with short TV episodes running in the background, rather than something with a longer attention requirement.

I'm a 28 year old male. Throughout my life I've had to struggle in silence with really distinguishing urges to commit violent rape on women. Thankfully I'm impotent and not very sexual so these urges can be ignored or got out of mind quickly (in most cases when I'm not purposely stimulating them).

If left alone I will rarely have these sexual thoughts and I can usually squish them within seconds of them appearing. But I'm also a gamer and Role Playing a serial killer is far easier to rationalize. This will occur once within the span of 2-3 months, I'll start to feel the urge to create a serial killer and I'll slowly begin to rationalize doing it. Of course the simple answer is don't, but they'll stick around until I do. So I'll eventually go through with this sexual fantasy, then feel bad about it, then swear never to do it again only to repeat the cycle later on. Recent virtual environments have made my Sadism feel far scarier and far worse. Within the last year I've attempted to master-bait too it, for example. I always thought my Sadism was something that couldn't really be treated but now I don't believe that is the case. The problem I have now I'm not sure who I can turn to for help or if I can even seek help locally.

When this problem isn't nagging at me I believe I am a moral person, a deep thinker and an empathetical human being. But when this problem comes it slowly consumes my thoughts until I get it over with. It's the dark side of me nobody knows about.

I always forgive her and sure enough she continues to drink and make life for me hell. 
I'm 16. Still living at home obviously with my mom and stepdad and siblings. But last week is when I knew I had to draw the line. It started with my mom wanting me to drive her to the minimart to get some groceries. Now my mom has a breathilizer in her car and she claims she couldn't do it herself because she was taking cough medicine. I didn't believe her but I needed some stuff also, so I stuck it out and drove her. 
So I'm doing my shopping and she tells me to pull around the car. This sounds pretty suspicious, so being the nosy teenager I am, I pull around the car and look through the windows to see what she's up to. Sure enough I see her buying 2 fifths of vodka and cigarettes. She promised the family that she wouldn't drink anymore so you can imagine I was pretty pissed. So I drive home and tell my stepdad what I saw because I figure he needs to know. Well, the last time my mom was drinking he swore that he would leave if he caught her again (this is a example of how my family enables her, no doubt) He asks her about it, she denies, he drops it completely. So here I am, angry, upset, frustrated, so I leave to my friends house.
 I stay at her house a couple days and on the second day my mom sends me a text saying ""I don't know what you saw but I'm innocent! I love you."" Now, I wasn't about to have this conversation over text so i call her twice, her being the unconfrontational person she is, doesn't answer. Sinking to her level I send her a text saying, ""Do you swear on my life that you did not buy vodka?"" she says yes. Now I know with my heart and soul that she bought it and hid it. I mean I saw it. Anyways I grit my teeth and soon have to go home. I'm brief with my mom and try to show her I'm still mad and not letting her get away with what she's done like everyone else. I've been spending the last days over at my grandmas, who lives 30 minutes away. I talked to her about it and she thinks I should stand my ground to show her that she can't get away with that. Therein lies the fucking tragedy. I want my mom to see that she has hurt me many times and hopefully to convince her that enough is enough. But I don't want to spend two years not speaking to my mom. On average when she's not drinking, we have a semi-good relationship. We watch shows together, talk, ect. But she has fucked it up once again. While I've been staying at my grandmas she has been sending me texts as if everything is okay, hopefully to win me back. So reddit, please help. Should I stand my ground, or ignore her problem and fake smiles to have a nice last couple of years? We also have a family vacation coming up and as you can imagine i dont want to spend it angry with my mom. Also keep in mind that I have tried to talk with my mom and it ends with cries and apologies and empty promises todo better. Fuck that man. I also don't have an optional living choice.

I'm 34 now. My childhood had its fun moments, but there were also a lot of traumas. Usually, one trauma would follow up another one. Often they'd overlap as well. I spent most of my life feeling miserable in this world. I'm often lonely.

I'm not normal. I don't have many friends. I enjoyed having friends when I was younger. Beyond the age of 20, social interaction wasn't so interesting anymore. None of the times I was in love with a girl, the love was answered. The last time I was in love was when I was 18. I think I'll never think of a girl as special again.

I'm not going into the details right now. Just setting the mood. I want to stick to the point.

Despite having seen a lot of crap, I'm doing pretty good in life. I've studied computer science, got my Msc, worked a few years in wage slavery, saved up lots of cash to last me a while... and now I'm running my own company. Working on a big project that may or may not have a big payoff. Exciting times.

By most people's standards, I'm doing alright. And I am. It's just that most of the time I struggle with existential questions. It's like all the destructive shit in my life has caused me to view everything as not important.

I have many problems with my own mind. But the one I'd like to tackle the most is the one that's costing me the most time.

Despite not going to school or a wage slave job anymore, I still feel shitty from 9 to 5 on school / work days. I feel best when it's friday evening and all throughout the saturday.

Sundays, I'm bored beyond belief and can't get myself started on anything. I feel apathic on sundays. Sunday used to be that godawful day before having to go to school / work, back when I was still going to school / work.

It's such a waste of time that I feel down in the morning and the early afternoon. I don't start feeling better until the late afternoon... starting 4'ish.

I'm an evening / night person alright. But still... why the hell do I have to hate mornings and early afternoons so much?

The feeling is strong. The moment the daylight starts making place for the dark of night, I feel better.

I also **strongly** prefer rain, storms, thunder &amp; lightning over any other type of weather. As soon as the rain starts to pour and the thunder starts sounding in the distance... I start to feel pretty friggin' awesome right away!

Kind of a shame... because that type of weathers is what we **don't** have 99% of the time.

So the lion's share of my waking time is spent not feeling comfortable with the time and the lighting conditions outside that are so typical of mornings and early afternoons.

I currently put in about 4 hours of work per day. I suspect that I could do more if I were feeling better. But life seems so pointless that I just can't bring myself to do more.

I've put in hard work in the past. I know I'm capable of it, but I hate working my life away with a vengeance.

Why does my mind have to be like that? Does anybody else suffer from the same thing? Can it ever be fixed, or have the horrid experiences of school and wage slavery already burnt themselves into my brain for life?",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_vjm34,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/vjm34/how_do_i_make_myself_feel_better_more_often_im/,

I suppose you should know that:

I was diagnosed with autism-spectrum disorder as a child.

I did not have a happy childhood. My dad left when I was 9, and I was bullied.

I was first attracted sexually to a child (a young boy, he was maybe... 6 or 7) when I was maybe 12 or 13. At this time, I was already involved in technically illegal things (""Playing"" with some boys in a way I should not be, most of them probably did not notice, though).

I had had crushes on girls a few times before this already, and actually had a girlfriend in the first grade or so.

First, I was basically ""gay pedophile"", I was only interested in young boys (Ages 5-11'ish, I guess).

After this, I had a stranger period with some fantasies involving me being a (usually preteen) girl.

Around this time, I first started looking at child porn. Legal stuff at first, then lolicon (drawn), then I started downloading hardcore child porn from limewire...

Gradually, things got first. At the very beginning, my 'fantasies' were not romantic in the least, they were purely sexual. Gradually, my fantasies became very romantic, and at this point in time I suppose I would enjoy a father-daugther type relationship with a young girl almost as much as I would a romantic relationship.

My sexual fantasies, however, moved right back into objectifying kids to downright creepy.

  I'm looking for next steps on how to deal with what is becoming a very pressing personal problem.  
  A short way to put it is I am extremely unhappy with myself.  I'm aware that my unhappiness is not entirely rational, and yet it persists.   
  Here are some of the feelings / thoughts I have on a regular basis (most days of the week):  
  - I will be single the rest of my life  
  - I am very unattractive (prob. not true)  
  - I am fundamentally unfit for a relationship  
  - I have wasted my life by throwing myself into my work, and am now physically, mentally, and emotionally damaged because of it   
  - My body is falling apart, my health is bad, I am overweight (prob. about 20% true)  

At the end of the day, I took a breath of fresh air and thought: ""Holy shit, you're completely irrational.  Why are you thinking this way?""  

  Here's something that happened today.  I had to deal with some poorly written code, and it just sent me right over the edge.  Not that I really acted out, but mentally it pushed me right over.  My thoughts were along the lines of: ""This is unbelievable.  There's no way I can fix this and make any progress.  Yet another example of a bunch of shit code that will consume hours upon hours of my time, causing me to stay late at the office and miss out on yet more social opportunities, meanwhile becoming ever more fat, sad, and lonely.  This always seems to happen, why the hell did I choose this career... etc etc.""
Today at work my coworker commented on my obvious irritation (he said 'it shows'), again even though I didn't take it out on anybody I was probably visibly unhappy.  

  Here's the part I don't get.  I recently moved into a beautiful new townhouse, into a beautiful new city, I make tons of money, make friends easily, and have a family that loves me, and yet I still have these spells were I just devolve into this mental whirlwind of angst and misery.  What is wrong with me?  It's ruining my life.  

  What should I do reddit?",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_rq82o,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/rq82o/dissatisfaction_with_life_incredible_sadness_and/,
1328173693.0,13,self.selfhelp,p7i5j,"Reddit, my girlfriend is planning on leaving me for her Ex-BF. I have 11 hours to save my relationship. PLEASE HELP!",20,7,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/p7i5j/reddit_my_girlfriend_is_planning_on_leaving_me/,"Redditors, I am in desperate need of your help to win back my girlfriend before it's too late. 

My beautiful girlfriend of 6 months and I have been happily dating with few complications to this day. However, there had always been a particular thorn at our side which was the presence of her Ex-boyfriend always wanting to be friendly with her. Although it bugged me, I had always respected my girlfriends independence and trusted her enough to not interfere with the friendly contact she had between this Ex-bf. 

In fact, one particular incident a month into our relationship happened when this Ex-bf came back into the picture, after several months of not talking to her, to present an opportunity to get back with him (since he was the one that severed ties in the first place) when I was already in the picture. I was there when she was faced with this decision, and she was there to witness the pain I felt the following days until she ultimately decided to stick with me because a) This guy life was headed down the wrong path after their breakup, and b) I ultimately was the better man with my life more-or-less figured out.

From then until now, we've been great. But,  like any couple we had our disagreements and annoyances but we were for the most part, very compatible. I never was actually able to let go of the fact that she nearly ended our relationship that fateful night revolving the Ex-Bf, and as I had mentioned before, it always unsettled me to see her maintain a healthy contact with him. Time and time again though, she would assert that she would never go back to him and was certain she made the right choice in choosing me.  

Warp ahead to this past weekend after we had spent the entire time together, she falls off the radar. On Monday, when I would try to message or text her, she would only respond with one word answers and nothing more. On Tuesday, it was more or less the same treatment, none of her usual cute messages were sent to me, and she made no attempt to see me which I found quite odd. When it came to today, I texted her what she had been up to lately because she seemed distant. I get a response almost 4 hours later that she was busy with school and that 'she'd like to talk to me.' I see this as a huge indication that she's going to break up with me tomorrow when I meet up with her after her class at 11:30.

So to sum up this huge backstory, my girlfriend is giving me the inkling that she's going to break up with me for her Ex-BF. I forgot to mention the reason why I think she'll be doing this for him because she I had caught her talking to him on facebook prior to me leaving on Sunday, and he then left a few suggestive messages on her wall thereonafter in which she would receive them quite warmly. 

Reddit, anyone who has followed my story this far needs to know that this girl means the world to me. I am shocked that she's planning to do this so suddenly after not too long ago she expressed how happy she was with me. This leads me to believe that she is confused and was tempted only by the allure of her Ex-BF and doesn't truly know what she wants and where she stands. 

HOW DO I SAVE MY RELATIONSHIP?

EDIT: I'm pretty much getting the notion now that all good things must come to an end and I'll have to brace myself to part ways with her in just under an hour. I'd like to thank everyone for their honest opinions and for trying to set me straight, it doesn't make it any easier for me to deal with it but it does provide some sort of closure for me as time draws near.

All these things have just recently happened to let all you know even though you probably don't care. I just recently got a girlfriend which sounds great at first because everyone wants someone to love and such but I have a terrible self confidence and lately I can't tell if she likes me, or the fact that I'm the nice guy who is gentlemanly. On our first date I bought her flowers and a cup cake and we went to a movie. But since then I am always worried about what she will respond when I text her or if she is playing a game on me because I'm the new kid. Another thing you need to know is that I just recently moved to a new house in Virginia from coming from Texas. I moved because my father got a job with homeland security, my friends have all missed me and they always say so too. But this is not all of what's been going on. My parents have realized how hard it is to live up here because everything seems to be a lot more expensive than Texas and Money has gotten tight. But even though money is right my mom insists on buying presents and always buying the best stuff for our family. She is very nice bit she isn't smart with money, and to put it into perspective just this month we spent over $1000 is groceries and other things and thus spending is killing me. I am always worried whether or not we can actually live like this. The stress has been building up for awhile now and I'm wondering if I'm better off dead so my parents don't have to worry about buying me anything. I keep walking into my kitchen and looking our knife set and if I can just go into the woods and do it. The stress lately is just making my actual heart hurt and I find it hard to breathe sometimes when I figure more out about how much were spending. You guys can destroy me all you want and troll me if you want because I honestly think this is my last Christmas.


EDIT: Thanks guys and girls I can't tell the difference but I have talked about it with my best friend from back in Texas and we decided on a sort of partnership plan where we can always talk about stuff like this. I have also talked with the girl and we have made amends and she says she loves me and I have talked to my parents and they have told me that as bad as it is I don't have to worry because we do have enough money to last.

Help?,15,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/hsag4/i_have_no_passion_and_quickly_switch_interests/,"I'm not sure what to do. I feel that I need to have a plan for my life, at least in general, something that I'm working towards. The problem is that I no longer have any passion and I keep drifting from plan to plan, unable to stay committed to one thing or another.

Growing up I wanted to be a medieval archaeologist. That was my passion for from age 12 to age 22. I went to college, got a bachelors in history, and went to field schools overseas to prepare for gradschool in archaeology. 

Then my senior year in college everything changed. I lost the spark.

What scares me the most is that I'm not sure how much of an impact the destruction of a 3 year relationship had on my overall passion for life. (We had been dating all throughout college and she was my world and what I thought was my future) This all imploded at the same time I was losing my spark for everything else I had worked for.

It's been over a year now and I think I can safely say that I'm well on the road to recovery from that relationship (new state, new job, new apartment, new friends, new life) but I'm still having trouble with passion.

I seem to swing wildly from one path to another. When I swing there I feel passionately about that plan and want to work very hard to achieve it, but then that fire quickly dies down. It's like deciding to go on a diet, then one morning you wake up, forget your on a diet, and eat chocolate cake for breakfast. It's only after you wipe the chocolate from your mouth do you remember you were on a diet and you're now demoralized that you just broke it.

At one point I was devil possessed to join the coast guard. Then I wanted to move Canada, then I wanted to join the FBI, then quit my job and go backpacking around the world, now I want to move to Australia.

Even my hobbies keep bouncing back and forth. For that same time frame 12yo to 22yo I was big into medieval reenactments. It was all I thought about. You could say I was obsessed to a degree. Then I lost that spark. I moved on to art work, threw all my energy into that, created an etsy store and spent hours making things, now I hardly do anything.

I have no passion for anything in particular anymore. I can't solidly plan for the future when what I want to do today might not be what I want to do tomorrow. Every time I get a new passion, I hear the voice in the back of my head saying ""Sure you want to do this now, but how long till THIS fades too? A week? A month? A year?"" and of course that voice of doubt only exacerbates things.

""Will this solution be easy to implement?""
Stay away from thoughts such as

I don't know anymore.,13,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1fdrws/how_do_i_deal_with_who_i_am_i_dont_know_anymore/,"Hello. This is my first post on this subreddit. I'm not even sure I know what I'm here for. Advice, maybe? Moral support? Maybe I just feel the need to tell my tale? I don't know. But I hope that maybe I can figure it out as I go on. For starters, I'll give you a bit of a background story to who I am. (Read: incoming wall of ranting and rambling text). Of course, I am as we all are. An ever changing being who discovers more about themselves daily. But I digress.

For seven or eight years, I was in a very abusive relationship. In every form you can think of. It started out as things I decided I could ""deal with"" such as not really being able to go to parties without him present. It escalated over the years to mental abuse, physical abuse and sexual abuse. I became hooked on prescription narcotics and would get abused when I mentioned wanting to get clean. I see now that he wanted to keep me dependant on him as he was my constant supply at the end of the relationship.

Three years into this, we had a child. My son is my world. Foolishly, I stayed with his father, allowing the abuse to continue. He never harmed the child. Only me. But his screaming and the loud banging from the objects he would throw would scare my son. I would cry with him and hold him to me, telling him that everything would be ok.

It is actually very difficult for me to write this. When I think of everything, I begin to get flashbacks and it is hard for me to think straight. I had thought about posting my story in /r/ptsd but I couldn't bring myself to read enough of the posts to determine if it belonged there as the memories (flashbacks or what have you) would start to come back.

I got out of the situation that I was in. I have been clean for a year and am now employed. (My ex wouldn't allow me to have a job so this is a big deal for me). I have had trouble in holding any sort of positive relationship but by the grace of the universe I have found someone who is sensitive to what I have been through and he gives me so much love and patience.

A problem that I have is that I have horrible trust issues and paranoia. I know that he says that he understands when I have my ""fits"" as we have come to call them but I can't see living like that forever. I know it hurts him that I don't trust him and I don't want to live with the constant fear that comes with paranoia. 

I also have night terrors. I have unconcious fits of what seems to be anger where I will strike out at anything that touches me, save for my son. He seems to be the only one who avoids my sleep fits, as if I know he is there. A very close friend of mine seems to think that I have developed some form of PTSD, but I am not sure about that.

I do have DID/DDNOS (multiple personality disorder). We have been discovering more and more about ourselves lately, where we come from, why we might be here. My alters and I have a system in place and we function quite well. But as we discover more, the flashbacks seem to get worse. How do we deal with this?

I know that I seem to have been rambling for some time now and I thank anyone who has taken the time to read my tale. 

We want peace. We want to be able to sleep at night without nightmares or night terrors. We want the anxiety and paranoia to at least be toned down. We're tired of being full of self loathing and loathing towards others. Any advice?

I kind of live two lives at the moment. I'm a 19 year old live-at-home college student, and my parents and I don't interact much. During the week at school, barely anybody knows my name. It gets kind of socially lonely, but I can deal with that. Flips over to the weekend and I go and spend time with High School friends at state college, or I work at home.

But emotional loneliness seems to affect me pretty heavily. I'm in a relationship right now, and I can feel myself overdoing it. We started dating around Christmas, but she's a year younger than me and therefore still in high school. I don't see her often, and I try not to text too much because I don't want to get clingy, but I really like her and I can tell that I'm relying on this too much. I get anxious that she'll leave me or that I'm too boring for her or that we don't have enough in common. 

I feel like this probably stems from the fact that I don't connect emotionally to many people at all, so when it happens I smother it, and I'd like to beat that.

1348315923.0,11,self.selfhelp,10am6q,How do I talk to my husband about getting help for his binge drinking?,15,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/10am6q/how_do_i_talk_to_my_husband_about_getting_help/,"My husband is a binge drinker and I don't know how I should respond. My first instinct is to get angry and upset, or cold and stern, but I don't think either of these would result in him actually getting any help. I'm tired of his apologies or excuses, I just don't want him to hurt himself, or drive me crazy with worry, or get into any trouble. He doesn't really drive (THANK GOD) but sometimes he wants to borrow my car to go get food or cigarettes. I've had to put a stop to that on a couple of occasions. 



Let me explain: We've been married a little over a year. During the time we dated we definitely got drunk together like any mid twenties couple might, but it was never a huge deal. Sometimes he'd get a little more drunk than me and be a bit obnoxious, as many people are. Or, I'd feel embarrassed but chalk it up to his anxiety around people that were my friends or family. 



The first time I realized this might be more was a little after we were engaged. We went to a family birthday dinner but were late in arriving because he had to work. It was about an hour away. When we got there, the kitchen was mostly closed but I ordered some appetizers and a drink and he just ordered drinks. Then more and more drinks, saying he needed to catch up. After a little while my family and friends who are practically family were hanging out and having a good time while my fiance was nodding over his beer and slurring something confusing once in a while. Finally I dragged him out, but not before he downed a last drink. We checked into a hotel and I tried to sleep while he tried to ""seduce me"". 



Cut to about a year later, and we've moved to a new city and are married. He was supporting us financially while I looked for full time work, so there wasn't much extra cash and I felt weird calling him out on things the few times he could afford to go out with friends. But then, I started noticing how he was when he came home and started getting angry and worried about his behavior. 



If you've ever seen the show Breaking Bad (and this is reddit, so I'm guessing yes) then imagine a 35 year old ""Flynn/Walter Jr."" weaving in your living room at 2am, trying to explain why he should go get McDonald's. Except my husband slurs even more than that kid does. And he doesn't have whatever charms Flynn/Walter Jr. tried to carry off. Then imagine this blacked out Flynn trying to cook himself pasta when you tell him you won't drive him to McDonald's. Yes. Or, getting mad at you because you woke up from a restless sleep when you heard the eye of the stove being turned on and angrily turned it off again because he had four eyes on and nothing cooking. (yup. I can actually hear this because I know what to listen for when he is like this, and can wake up from whatever sleep I'm getting) Then imagine that same restless sleep being waken by another all too familiar sound: urination that isn't making that particular tinkling in the bowl it should be making. I think I've caught him peeing somewhere he shouldn't be about three times in the past year. Once he was aiming but missing the toilet. Once he was peeing in the recycling bin. Once, I just discovered a wet floor when I woke up in the morning. Fun! And then I get preemptively mad when I see him come home like this because I know I'm in for a night of frustrating ""babysitting"".



It's getting embarrassing to be around his friends because even though they're drinking, it's not as excessive as him, and when he does things that make him look bad I feel awful too. For 4th of July he brought his iPad and iCade to a BBQ. He got drunk and when we left, said he was putting the stuff in the car before saying his goodbyes. Then we can't find the things and it takes him a week to locate them. He had put them into another guest's car that looks nothing like ours. I had to drag him away from the party before this, and then wander around hoping to find where he'd stashed his expensive toys. Friends stopped to help and though they were gracious, it was humiliating.


Tonight he said he was going to just pop into a party for a co-worker who lives within walking distance. Even though it was 9pm on a Friday I was tired and wanted to stay in, but he wanted to wish her happy birthday. It's now 7am and I can't find him. I've decided that if he doesn't show up for work at 9am I'm calling the co-worker, police and hospitals to see if he's there. (Edit: I don't think would cheat. I know you're going there. For one, the birthday girl is a lesbian in a relationship and two, I've never known him to look seriously at another girl at a party ever.)


I've talked to him about this before, and he's tried drinking no more than four drinks in a night. No success. I've tried making our exit when I see him getting close but he still manages to down one or two last ones as we go by literally pouring them down his throat and then he's frustrating to be around, if not destructive. This type of behavior maybe happens every two weeks, though he sometime drinks at home when I've gone to bed.


Sorry for this long rant. Here's what I really want your advice on:
How can I talk to my husband in a way that will help him see I really just want him to take care of himself and be safe and responsible? What should I say? What should I not do? And does anyone have experience with this that has become positive? I've done research and therapy might help him get this under control and allow him to even drink socially but not binging, but what do I say and how do I say it?

I had trouble making friends growing up, so I started to sort of act like whoever I was talking to in order to try and get them to like me.  This habit has become ingrained in my behavior.

I talk different depending on who I'm talking to in a way that mirrors whoever that person is.  This becomes awkward when I end up hanging out with two friends from separate social circles at once, since I'm sort of lost as to how I should be acting.  It's an awkward feeling.  It's more noticeable to me at certain times, such as the aforementioned situation or when I'm talking to my family members, who I've always had an oddly distant relationship with so going from being with friends to talking to them just makes me feel like I'm cold.

Anyhoo, how can I change my personality to become more 'stable' across situations?

1343569344.0,12,self.selfhelp,xcai6,Mind dump of my self-help experience,14,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/xcai6/mind_dump_of_my_selfhelp_experience/,"Ok, I've read a lot of Self-help books over the years, it has to be in the hundreds and my mind has accumulated so much good that I have to share. 


**Time Management** In terms of time management, a lot of people try and make it so that they can do everything. The first step should always be to eliminate the unnecessary, things that you don't need to do, aren't your job to do etc. We must only do that which really matters and let the small things truly slide. 

Then after that it's how can you do this thing in the most efficient way possible? This is the realm of time management. Paretos rule states that 80% of desired output comes from 20% of input across a wide variety of areas so we must let go of the inefficient 20% and either save 80% of our time or we can do the job of 5 men by being more efficient. 

Another great too is Parkinsons Law. This is the law which states that a task swells to fill the time allotted for it. We all have assignments that we do at the last minute. If you set a specific self created deadline for something it will get done in that amount of time, The release of mental worrying about this is worthy of the tip in and of itself. 

**Boredom** - We all experience boredom in our lives and I've had long periods of meditation (upto 4 hours/day for 1 month once) and one way around it is to be completely aware of whatever you're doing. When you become totally visually aware of what's around you or simply hearing the raindrops falling on the window so crisply you can never be bored. Simply being present with a cup of water is a beautiful experience. Giving it your fullest attention. Life is joyous. Complete concentration is achievable through practice. See Eckhart Tolles ""The Power of Now"" for other tips. 

**Emotional Upheaval** - We also all have negative and conflicting emotions (one conscious and the other subconscious) and a great method of releasing these emotions so we can see more clearly can be found in a book by Hale Dwoskin called ""The Sedona Method"". IT teaches you to recognise an emotion and through a simply series of questions release it with the final root emotion being that of fear of death. 

**Creating Habits** - Habits are what make us. We are all creatures of habit and as the proverb goes, we make habits then habits make us. If you want to set something into a habit like start working out or stop masturbating then give yourself a calendar month (start on the 1st and finish on the last day) and make it somehow so you do the habit daily. If you only plan to go gym 3 times per week then make it every day for this month and it will ingrain the habit so deeply within you that within 30 days you will feel natural in the gym environment. 

30 days is long enough for you to know that at the end of it you can simply switch back to whatever your older routine was but it's just as easy to keep at it. Success is put on autopilot this way as we just set habits that make us what we want to be and allow time to bring us success.

 If you are unconfident with setting habits then start small and work your way up. You can just say ""For the next 30 days, I will do 5 push-ups during the day"". That might sound silly but nobody else needs to know and you can build from there. Every person has to start at their current level. Set something slightly challenging but not so out there that it seems ridiculous. Setting habits back to back month after month you will be astonished at how much your confidence grows and what you achieve. 

**Socializing** - We also all need to socialize and communicate with other humans much to our chagrin. I deep down believe that each human is alive on Earth to help each other grow. We come up against our ego again and again when we meet other people and it gives us an excellent opportunity to let it go and have an increased sense of peace. The greatest book I've read in this area is Dale Carnegies ""How to win friends and influence people"". It's really cheap to buy on Amazon and a condensed page of notes can be found [here](http://www.westegg.com/unmaintained/carnegie/win-friends.html).

If anyone has any questions or wants to talk, I'm available freely here by DM and in comments. I've read so many self help books and installed a ridiculous amount of positive life-aspiring habits that I feel everyone needs to know!

Anyone experience anything similar, and what did you do?",12,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/vyn23/i_have_absolutely_every_reason_to_be_fine_with/,"So a bit of background.  I have absolutely no reason to be down on myself at all.  I'm a guy in my early twenties, and I'm in grad school.  Before grad school, I had a good job that I loved in a place that I loved, and made enough money to be pretty comfortable.  I will still have that job if I want it after I finish school, but I have so many other opportunities open to me as well.  I am both financially independent and comfortable.

I'm intelligent.  I'm going to grad school on fellowship, and in undergrad I managed a 3.92 GPA without trying too hard.  Things generally come easily to me, and usually when I do have to struggle at something, I eventually get it.

People like me.  I make friends easily, and the friends that I make I also tend to keep.  I'm a kind, generous, and unselfish person.  I help my friends whenever I can, I talk to people I don't know who look like they need someone to talk to, and I never judge someone for what they do or how they live.  People come and talk to me because they feel like they can.

I'm 85% sure I'm not objectively ugly.  If I walk by a mirror unexpectedly, I usually wish I was as good looking as THAT guy before I realize that guy is me.  I work out pretty regularly, and I also have hobbies/sports that are both physically demanding and generally considered cool, extreme, or adventurous.

I know all this stuff, but I really do not like myself.  I really try to.  I live as if I like myself, hoping that one day I'll wake up and find that I actually do, but that hasn't helped yet.  I have good supportive friends (most of them don't know I feel this way), but I have extreme difficulty taking compliments from them.  Whenever they compliment me in some way, I am convinced that they are lying to be nice, even if I objectively know that isn't true.  Whenever I look at myself in the mirror, I feel really ugly.  Hell, I even feel fat oftentimes, even though I'm 5'9"", 140lbs, and muscular.  I don't feel any real sense of self worth (to be clear, I should mention that I'm nowhere close to suicidal.  It's even harder to like yourself when you're dead).  I tend to be very hard on myself for every flaw and failing, even for things that are beyond my control.  I don't want to do this, but I do.

I think to some extent, I've been like this for a while, but I did notice that it got much more pronounced when my girlfriend of ~6 years (who I was picking out a ring for) cheated on me with really a lot of different guys and broke up with me the day after I moved to a different state for her.  So that didn't help me too much.  Even so, I thought I was fine, I thought i was just feeling down for a time, and I honestly thought I felt really OK about myself after a while.

I finally realized how absolutely abysmal my self esteem was just recently.  There's a girl I've had an interest in for some time.  We're good friends, and we've always sort of had that little bit of tacit interest in one another.  Well, I finally kissed her and she reciprocated.  That made me very happy for a short amount of time.  I haven't dated at all in the year since my last girlfriend and I really think I'm ready to again.

The problem is, after New Girl left for the evening, I had a total breakdown.  I felt sick to my stomach, I thought I was going to vomit, the works.  I was absolutely certain that I should never have kissed her, because obviously she is making such a huge mistake.  There are so many other single guys to choose from, and I am clearly the wrong choice.  I am really, truly a disgusting, pathetic, small excuse for a human being, and any day now she'll realize that.  I feel so bad for involving her with someone as worthless and ugly as me, when she has so many better choices.  I have no redeeming qualities, and she can't possibly be thinking straight.

And that's how I found out what I really think of myself.  I know objectively that none of it is true, but I can't get that into the part of my head that actually has an opinion of me.

What do you think? ,14,3,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/v9aeq/what_it_means_to_be_confident_how_i_see/,"I posted this in /r/philosophy which was the wrong subreddit (sorry about that) so I'm basically copypasting it again

This is my life lessons and things I have learned over the years. Its how I live my life and wanted to share it with others to see what they thought of it.
(btw this is on a paper I wrote to myself and I have edited it over the years. It is written directed to myself and myself as the audience. I have no idea if that makes any sense lol)


Confidence is a state someone refers themselves because they tend to stay in a confident state more often than any other state. (oppose to a shy state) When someone tries to become ""confident"" there is usually a big misconception. There is a high possibility of acting arrogant or awkward when they fake confidence.

If someone says they want to become more confident I believe they should be saying they want to be truly happy with them self. I believe if you want to achieve genuine confidence then you need to be happy with your life and live by your core values. On a scale 1 to 10 of how happy are you, are you saying it is a 10?

If you are faking in being confident then you are faking that you are genuinely happy with being yourself. There is nothing confident in pretending to be confident. You are not living with your emotions, facing your fears, acknowledging them, and not hiding them away from others. If you become completely honest with yourself you become more self accepting.

When you were younger people would always tell you that to become more confident you should stop caring what people think of you. They probably could have said this A LOT better. If you have strong values then you don't need to seek validation because you are already happy and the only thing you should be doing is giving to others. This means you aren't accepting anything in return because don't need anything from them. You become self-reliant.
Becoming truly happy is very simple. The problem with simplicity is that it is hard to interpret it because you need to be willing to do something different from what other people do. It has been hard to share your philosophy with your closest friends and you shouldn't try to change people who do not want to change. You may not even be changing them for the better.  Not many people can hold the quality of becoming genuinely happy with themselves until an old age. Even then it seems very rare. 
From observing people from all ages it seems these are three things that stick out that hold them back into becoming happy.


1) Appreciation. A problem I'm sure you remember when you started weight lifting was you compared yourself to others. (Remember how it only took you a day to overcome this? LOL I'm happy for who gave me this life lesson on a forum) If you compare yourself to other people it's a sure way to become a miserable person. You need to become aware of what you have in life. People go through life not aware of what they really have. The worst is how people my age are so caught up on their own life problems and how they are growing older. They get so caught up on this that they forget to realize that their parents aren't getting any younger. I feel they won't appreciate their parents as much as they should until they're gone. That is a problem I feel most people have experienced (with family that passed away) or will experience in their life.
How often do you beat yourself down and compare it to how often you appreciate yourself and what's cool about yourself. This is realizing self appreciation. 
The more appreciation you show towards people the more they feel connected to you. You slowly become this charismatic being that people sense. Become more expressive 
with the world. 


2) Intentions. Another problem I feel people have is they lose track of their true intentions. What I mean by this is that people always make intentions for things they want to do, but not for how they want to feel. Everytime you go out you get to explore yourself. If you change your perspective on your intentions you change your perspectives on life.
You can say ""I'm going to go to school today"" or ""I'm going to the gym/run some errands"", but people eventually lose track on why they do certain things and it can lead to becoming unmotivated.
If you wake up and have the intention of feeling such as, ""I'm going to be happy today"" or ""I'm going to have an awesome day"" It changes your perspective on reality. This makes you realize your real intentions when your life isn't going so well.  Before you act you can ask yourself ""Does this reaction make me more happy?"".


3) Accountability.  In my opinion this is the hardest to recognize. Everything else may be simple but I feel some people cannot let go of their pride for there life to become accountable.
Why do I say this? It's because ACCOUNTABLE PEOPLE NEVER BLAME OTHER PEOPLE.
People who are accountable are in an attitude to learn from an event while people who are blaming others are stuck because they believe they're ""perfect""(they did nothing wrong or do not want to admit it) from what has happened. The example I always see is from playing team video games. The guy who blames their team is the one who isn't looking to improve because they believe they did nothing wrong. The reality is you could always improve. 
Why can you always improve? You become a leader in this world. Leaders are accountable and people who are accountable take initiative. In team games I have to act as the leader of a team of 5 random people or else everyone is going to blame each other if we lose at the end of the game. They could at least blame me for not leading them to victory.
People do not want to take the blame so they do not want to be held accountable but it makes you stronger. You become a powerful leader. Leadership isn't ""I am good at telling people what to do"" It's about becoming accountable.",,False,,t5_2qho7,1340144746.0,,,True,t3_v9aeq,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/v9aeq/what_it_means_to_be_confident_how_i_see/,

It's long, sure, but most life problems are usually nothing if not deep...

I've always been a terrible procrastinator. I fit the stereotypical traits: always leaving things to the last minute; wasting time on things that I don't even really enjoy; getting anxious as time goes on because I always have something to worry about - yet I have no desire to attend to it (which leads to a perpetuating cycle of self loathing); and so forth. This has generally related to my study habits, of course. In the past in which I was taking my undergraduate course the eventual pressure that I felt was enough to get me started. And yes, getting started is often the hardest part of a supposedly-daunting task. After I had started, the task became incomparably easier, and having been blessed with a relatively decent intellectual brain, I was generally able to submit something (usually a day or two late at the most), and still get a half-decent mark, even after the penalties were applied.

Two psychological breakdowns and the realisation that I was an undiagnosed schizophrenic AND major depressive for over a decade later, I'm now stable and studying to become a social worker. I am very happy with life, I am no longer anxious about social relationships, I am much more relaxed, and I became for the first time that I could recall in a long time, happy and at peace within myself. It's great. This was all around 2 years ago now, and I'm still going strong.

But there is still a nagging behavioural trend that I have had exceptional trouble in shaking, being my procrastination. If anything, it has gotten worse. I'm not sure of the reason why, but it just began with me not being able to get started - ""that's normal, no need to worry yet..."" - to simply not being able to relate to any sense of benefit that submitting the work will provide for me. I failed two of my subjects last year because I simply could *not* for the life of me bring myself to do the work. It led to another stumble into an anxious state of depression: feeling bad about myself because I was failing as a student (not to mention the fact that I was doing a disservice to myself), feeling that I was ruining my future, etc. This vicious circular thinking only led me to feel worse about myself, and the symptoms grew proportionately deeper. I took the coward's way out - in the end I didn't do the work required, and I subsequently failed. Things got better after gaining support from doctors and university officials, and after the fact I eventually grew stable again, mainly because I wasn't beleaguered by the anxiety that the assessments led me towards.

Anyway. After 6 months off during which I attempted to stabilise, I have found myself in the same position, pretty much. I'm a bit older and wiser, but getting started has proved pretty much beyond me.

Until last night. I had a conversation with a dear friend, during which we discussed her similar inability to do her taxes a year ago (she's able to do a retrospective submission, so she'll be okay!) When I was talking with her about it last year we had concluded that it was easier to commit yourself to doing things for other people, but ""for some reason"", it was much more difficult to charge up the motivation to do things that would benefit ourselves, at least in our cases. This conclusion lasted until last night, during which we were discussing it again whilst I was venting over my concerns with procrastination. She brought up our conversations from last year, and I had a brainwave. I realised the connections between a few blindingly obvious things:

1. As sentient human beings, we all possess an ego that houses the activity of **desiring personal reward** and a **sense of want**. It can be tamed, but is still necessary in order to survive. Desiring something isn't wrong, but as with all things, doing something to excess usually leads to things getting out of control. i.e. My procrastination from doing my assessments getting to the point of personal and professional disaster.

2. One of the reasons as to why we are willing to extend ourselves to other people in need is because there is a *tangible reward* to be found as a result of doing so. We feel happy that they have been helped by us, therefore we feel useful, therefore we feel wanted, etc. We can also be happy because they are happy. I suppose it can be a mixture of selfish (yet not necessarily bad) and selfless reasons, whatever your motive is.

3. We also do things for ourselves that offer the prospect of **tangible, immediate rewards**, such as the case of helping other people. In a simplistic case, we eat a certain food because it is pleasing to us, and we feel the pleasurable effects immediately upon ingestion.

4. **The Problem**: Doing things for ourselves that involve rewards that are NOT immediately experienced - such as studying, which becomes useful when you receive your final marks, as an example; and doing taxes, which provides a return that is not immediate and may take some weeks to become realised - can take a back seat in priority against things that are more immediately rewarding, such as watching television, playing videogames, spending too much time on facebook and reddit, for example (things that I do, anyway). In my case, I was not able to **personally relate** to a sense of reward for doing my schoolwork, and as such I prioritised with doing more egoic, pleasurable endeavours instead, despite the cost. The cost didn't matter, only the pleasure that I took to be more important.

That was my problem. My sense of priority was not with the long-term goals. When I realised this last night, it was as though a switch turned on in my head. After so many years of confusion as to why I behaved in this self-destructive manner, the problem, the confusion, the confliction, everything made sense, and was finally organised in my mind as a belief. I realised that I am a human being that has *wants and desires*. This is not a bad thing in itself, but the way in which I was choosing to express these facets of behaviour was not conducive to a healthy state of wellbeing for myself. So I was lead to make further conclusions:

1. I am a person that has wants and desires. So far my focus has been on obtaining immediate rewards as opposed to those found in the future, which have appeared to be too far away for me to relate to.
2. I decided that **I was worth the effort of going the hard yards and delaying gratification**. This was the idea that I could finally relate to personally. I could see myself now, and foresee a future in which I was happy for having done things whose rewards weren't immediately available, but still *potentially* so.

If I had asked myself if I was worth the effort before my enlightening periods of personal breakdown, I dare say that my answer would be a definite ""no"" (because I couldn't relate to a healthy sense of self-worth/esteem - I was during that time very sick). But now I know what benefits come from being healthy and happy, and that these states of being are achieved through hard work. I've now finished one of my late assignments, and will be working on another over the weekend.

I hope that I have explained myself effectively. I would assume that my experience will be relevant only to certain people and their procrastination, but my hope is that it provides some sort of model to which some people can relate, and hopefully they can find some benefit to applying these thoughts to their own situations. In any case, I'm much happier, I feel whole again, and I feel in touch with a sense of future that involves effort and putting in hard work, something formerly outside my dreaded comfort zone. To all my fellow downward-spiral slackers, I wish you wellness, happiness and luck!

TL;DR:
- We are creatures that possess innate sense of want and desire. These are not inherently bad things.
- Procrastination is, at least for me, submitting to activity that provides immediate reward as opposed to a promise of future success. This applies most adeptly to the case of studying, at least in my situation.
- I overcame my crippling and destructive procrastination by admitting my inherent weakness as a creature of desire, and related myself to a sense of desire for achieving long-term fulfilment.
- The way I justified this was asking myself if I was worth the effort.
-Profit.

I hope this makes sense to y'all. Godspeed!",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_dy802,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/dy802/my_revelation_on_helping_to_fix_my_endless_cycle/,

I am a very attentive, caring, selfless, and understanding person. These ""qualities"" have brought me happiness through making others happy, but they have also brought me sadness. 

At the end of the day, I worry too much. Lately I've been dealing with some anxiety. I see my mom and the way she is - extremely anxious, worries constantly about everything, OCD... am I the way I am because of her? The last thing I want is to turn out like her, caged in by an uncontrollable fear that everything is going to go wrong or that everyone is annoyed by me at all times. 

As much as my big heart has set me apart in good ways, I know it is holding me back in life. Growing up, it was a setback with bullying. The advantage was that I became a lot more compassionate and understanding in general, but these qualities open your heart up to the smallest problems and magnify them - sometimes you realize they aren't even problems at all and you've invented them in your head. For example, when you think someone might be upset with you, and then you realize that the issue hasn't even phased them. This happens to me every day. Every damn day. It's stressful! And can easily get me down...

I've met many people in my life... all kinds of them. The people I love the most are the people who are loud, outgoing, fun people like me. But honestly? The people that are the best to be around are the chill people. You know, the people who just don't give a fuck. I'm not talking about the quiet people who actually have a million insecurities underneath their layer of avoidance. I'm talking about the calm, confident, strong people that don't worry about anything (unless they really really have to). I know that every personality comes with its downsides, but I believe that a combination of the way I've been so far with being more ""chill"" can help me with a lot of my problems and insecurities. When I'm around ""chill"" people, I feel... weightless, happy, and I worry less. It's because they don't really give a fuck... they aren't judging me... nothing phases them... and I wish I could move at their speed. Instead I stop from time to time and make sure everything is ok, and they just laugh. Because nothing really mattered to them. I always hear the phrase, ""Come on, just chill! Haha."" Chill people - how do you do it? Really, what goes on in your head? Do you feel like an asshole for not caring or... what? 

I feel like if I want to make it in life, I need to learn how to be a stronger person, but still retain my compassionate side somewhere for when I actually need it. As it is now, it's too out of control and it's really setting me back. 

**TLDR; I am an outgoing, understanding, caring, and compassionate person that values these qualities but struggles with their drawbacks - some anxiety and I worry too much. I've always been curious as to how people can be ""chill"" and just not give a shit. How can I be more like them? I believe this will make me stronger and happier.**",,False,,t5_2qho7,1365521844.0,,,True,t3_1bzsce,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1bzsce/i_want_to_know_how_to_be_a_chill_person/,

Immature 23/f needs help.,14,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1azqq0/identifying_personal_boundaries_and_needs/,"**tl;dr:** How do you identify needs and red flags for relationships, so you can have happy and fulfilled friendships and romances, and not settle for what will be miserable once the feel-good chemicals settle?

Hi, throwaway account here. I'm 23, f, but I've had a hard past. Thus, I am immature in some areas, though mature in others. It's embarrassing and causes issues. Today I'd like some input on one area.

To put it straight, I think I'm a bit of a doormat and people pleaser (about 70%). I like people, am very empathetic, and genuinely care about people and their interests and trails, and I'm proud of myself for that. This can set me up for pain though, because I'm not very forward, and kind of ""hide"" myself. I now leave people that are jerks or super self-centered, but I don't stand up for myself much or set clear boundaries (nothing sexual, only social) and I don't make my needs known (I have ideas that it's ""wrong"" or ""needy""). I had an it's-complicated crash and burn and looking back there were some small issues and big red flags I saw but rationalized. I believe much can be worked out and endured with love as the fuel. But I let my feels rationalize my brain when I *knew* there were problems, that had to be addressed or the relationship had to end.

I think I have a very low standard for what I expect from people, which I confuse with my desire to not judge and to accept people (which, when healthily expressed, I admire in myself and others like). I've even thought ""if I had an SO in the future cheat on me I probably wouldn't leave them"". At best I should say ""I will consider it then"", not already decide I'll stay. How messed is that? 
 
I know I'm selling myself short, and I want to be fulfilled in healthy relationships that meet my needs and theirs, and I'm worried I'll settle for unhealthy ones unconsciously. How do I identify things that I *need* in a relationship, or deal-breakers/red flags I can't stand for, and stick to them? Where's the line between caring and understanding and miserable push-over?

Last year was the worst year of my life....  I lost my job - the company went bankrupt, I had to put down my wifes dog, I moved 1600 miles away from family for my wife... then... my wife passed away.  She was only 35 - undiagnosed heart defect, undetected....

I moved back home and I am living with my mother for now which is very frustrating at times, I miss living on my own but I just lost my second job at the end of the year - lack of work....

I went back down to where we moved to and moved back and put all my stuff in storage.  I had a MAJOR blow out with my mother in law, she actually said I was the worst thing that actually happened to her daughter and I should of died FIRST (not instead of).

My mother in law is a very evil person, the reason we went down there was for my wife to help out her father and mother.  Her father is not doing well and the mother said she had cancer which turned out to be false and what I believe was feigned for the sympathy and this leads me to this....

I feel guilt for going down there, I think if we would of stayed up here, my wife would still be alive.  I think the stress of the move caused her to pass earlier than planned and  I had a chance to change our course but I didn't....

I was there when my wife passed and I have recently (since I went back to pack everything up) I have recently started having something like flashbacks (never had them before this)  I am back in that moment when I found her.  I sometimes feel like we died on the way down there (i started to doze off on the drive down on the last leg of the drive) and sometimes I think we crashed and I am in some sort of limbo and she moved on without me...  but I know that is just craziness...

I am fighting all I can to better myself.  I am fighting to make my life better, I lost close to 80 lbs, I am going out and having fun, I have decided to go back to school, I have even met someone who makes me very happy...  

But at times, when things quiet down, feelings of being trapped in my own failure make me feel lost.  Failure that I didn't provide well enough for my wife, failure that I didn't stop us from going down there, failure that I am out of work and virtually homeless and failure that I was powerless to do anything while she died in front of me.",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_1as5v2,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1as5v2/i_think_i_need_some_advice/,

1343250297.0,11,self.selfhelp,x5hgk,The past 30 days of my life.,12,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/x5hgk/the_past_30_days_of_my_life/,"Hey guys, this is my first time posting anything on Reddit but the past month or so of my life has been a roller coaster, to say the very least. I decided to write about what has happened and how I have learned to better myself for the future. I thought I would share it and maybe provide hope to others.




The past 30 days have been some of the most tumultuous of my entire life. I graduated college a little over a month ago with a degree in Business Administration specializing in Marketing. I had no job but a “promising” internship that I had hoped would lead to a full time offer. I had a girlfriend of almost a year, who I saw as potentially someone I would spend the rest of my life with. My life was going great and I was on the right side of the tracks……Then that all changed.


After graduation I went on vacation with my family to North Carolina for a week, a celebration of sorts, for obtaining my degree. I returned a week later and within days of returning I received a text message from my girlfriend saying “I need to talk to you about something.” I didn’t need to be a rocket scientist to know what that means. My girlfriend broke up with me, telling me the typical cliché “it’s not you, it’s me” and “I don’t feel the same way anymore.” At the time I was devastated, we had spoken about “us” long term and marriage 48 hours prior to her breaking up with me. We had known each other since freshman year and had a myriad of mutual friends. Coincidentally, I learned at my “promising” internship that same week that there would not be a job offer for me at the end of the summer.


At this point, I felt like life had pushed me into a hole with no chance of climbing out. No job and lost my girlfriend all in the same week, the phrase “great things happen all at once” didn’t exactly fit. I just wanted to give up, I had applied to more than 50 jobs by the first week of July (I have the spreadsheet to prove it) with all them saying “I wasn’t who they were looking for.” I also was lucky enough to see my ex-girlfriend make out with some guy less than a week after we broke up. I was angry, depressed, sad, hurt, basically every sad adjective in the book. Thankfully, through a strong support system from my family and friends, I was helped from the bottomless hole life put me in.


I was more motivated than ever to prove myself right and put the past behind me. I applied to every job under the sun. I networked whenever and wherever. I accepted every cup of coffee and went to every happy hour. I told myself its not “if I get a job, it’s when I get a job.” I only allowed positive thoughts to run through my head.


Through patience and perseverance, I received a full time offer last week from a great company. I wouldn’t have been able to write this if it wasn’t for my constant networking and my pursuit of every opportunity. I will never forget the moment when I received the phone call from the human resources department saying, “We would like to extend an offer to you.” I knew my life was going to change immediately. I no longer had to worry about going back to my parents’ house or brown nose at my “promising” internship.


The reason I wrote this was to remind myself to never give up hope. Life will knock you down, it is your choice if you want to get back up and keep fighting. If you want something bad enough, you will get it. Maybe not tomorrow or the day after, but through patience and determination you will achieve your goals.



Hopefully, I did this right. Please take this however you want, I really wanted to share this.",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_x5hgk,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/x5hgk/the_past_30_days_of_my_life/,

I feel as if all my days are just a haze of boredom.  I feel as if I'm dying for something interesting, something stimulating.  When I complain about this to people, they always try to suggest things they find interesting, which of course bore me within the space of a day.  I can't finish a book because I get bored midway through.  I spend tons of money on new, promising hobbies just for them to bore me soon after I begin.

Of course, when you say you are bored to someone, no one thinks it's that big of a deal.  The only analogy I can make is my boredom is to regular boredom as depression is to regular sadness.  I have difficulty doing work or motivating myself to do anything besides browse the internet, which bores me but at least it isn't expensive or demanding of my time.  I eat constantly because it stimulates my brain for a short while.

I don't know what to do or what is wrong with me.  If anyone has had any similar experiences or has any suggestions for me, I would really appreciate it.  It is bad enough feeling this way, on top of it I feel very alone since I've never heard of anyone else experiencing this.

And for a long time, we fear going through that again. I used to be called weird all the time, and I hated being called it. Then, I found someone that let me get my hurt feelings out with them. And I realized, I don't deserve to be called weird. I learned that we as humans can fear something for so long, and once we've finally emotionally healed from the pain, we realize we don't deserve that stuff in our lives. And we move on. 

The key to emotionally healing, is to let yourself go through it. I'll give examples. 

This just happened. I texted my girlfriend ""hey sexy, I'll call you at 10."" I got no response. I started feeling pain. I realized that this was a childhood wound. I let myself feel the pain, and let it fully complete. I let her not reply back, and now I've gone through the pain I was feeling. 

The deal is, your body is always wanting to emotionally heal itself. We as people try to stop it because we don't want to feel pain. If we're insecure because she didn't reply, we text back a few more times. Instead of feeling, we try to stop it. 

Here's another example. Someone beat you up at school, and now the next time you go into school you feel scared. The fear is your body healing itself. What some people might do is not go to school, or hide somewhere. What someone that wants to be healed would do, is go in there and let himself be afraid. Your body will heal on its own. Let it. 

Another thing you can do, is have someone that you can be emotional with. Someone you can say ""hey man, I'm feeling afraid because I was beat up, can I talk to you about it?"" If you have someone that lets you get your emotions out, lets you cry, that'll help the healing process so much better. 

I'm always here for you guys if you want to talk, I'll help you heal.

Here are some differences between the states:

* narrow, repetitive and mostly useless focus such as worry or escapism vs. broad, efficient and more effective focus

* pessimistic expectations vs. optimistic expectations

* painful ""no, I don't want to do that, it would be hard and even success would suck"" vs. pleasant and kind of rushy ""yes, go do that, it's achievable and the outcome can be good""

* not thinking in terms of a unified image of myself and simply focusing on particular things without much perspective vs. thinking in terms of a unified image of myself

* choosing activities impulsively vs. choosing activities intelligently

* enjoying escapism and disliking the idea of doing various non-escapist activities vs. not enjoying escapism and liking the idea of doing various constructive activities

* being inwards focused and often introspective vs. having drives to reach out socially

* having painful difficulty with focus required for intellectual tasks vs. effortlessly focusing and enjoying it

* rejecting results of my actions or plans as not good enough and not being willing to compromise vs. being satisfied with them

* being able to obtain pleasure from some individual pleasant sensations or objects I focus on vs. a broader sense of pleasure from my overall environment

I initially discovered the ""having energy"" state via drugs. Since then, I've found that it can be brought about via some offline socializing, spending time in nature, and sustained successful constructive activity that I like. Unfortunately, I'm still not able to stay in that state enough.

The ""lacking energy"" state is reinforced by pointless escapist activity (which I call ""void""), such as reading random stuff on Reddit that's interesting or amusing but not useful to me. It doesn't always seem like an unhappy state because I can feel good while doing such escapist activity. However, the way I feel when ""having energy"" can by much better. The main problem with ""lacking energy"" is that it makes me only want to do escapist activity.

Anyway one of the more distressing things I've come to realize is that I really don't like my friends very much at all. I made all of them back in high school, when video games were basically all I was interested in, and honestly nowadays I just find them really boring and negative. Pot calling the kettle black I suppose, but I feel like whereas I'm trying to do something to change, they're pretty content with the way they are. I also get the impression that they kind of disapprove of my efforts to better myself. They never openly criticize it but they always seem kind of disdainful, which really bothers me, and makes me feel sort of discouraged.

Which is fine, I guess, if they're happy. But at the same time I really don't want to be around them because I feel like they're pulling me back into my old habits. The analogy I came up with is it's like if I were a recovering alcoholic, and all these friends did was invite me out to drink.

One thing I did was go away for a weekend to a different city and stay in a hostel, by myself because none of my friends wanted to go, and I met these amazing, motivated people from all over the world, and I felt like I had way more in common with them than my friends back home. Like just their worldview and ambitions and stuff, I felt like we had so much to talk about.

But now I'm back home, and those people are all out there while I'm here with my boring friends.

Part of me just wants to never really talk to them again. But at the same time they're kind of like a security blanket. They're really the only friends I have these days, and the thought of leaving behind the only friends I have is scary.

It also feels kind of cold-hearted. I mean these people have, in a way, been there for me all these years. But at the same time I have this feeling that I've sort of outgrown them.

   I'm not sure if I've posted this in the right place, so if I have not please let me know of a better location :) 

  
  For the past few years, I've been having trouble focusing and concentrating. Even on topics that interest me. I seem to have some sort of ADD issue when trying to read or focus on a task.  I jump from one task to another and then back to the first task. Things get completed eventually but it's very haphazard. 

Even when I read for pleasure, I find myself jumping between two or more books in the same reading session.  When I try to read for my career (which I love), I can only read a bit at a time before I try to focus on something else. Hell, even when I'm playing a video game, I can't play something for more than 20 minutes without my mind wandering. 


Are there exercises I can do (Reading, meditating, etc) to help me regain my focus? Is it possible this is a medical condition? I used to be able to concentrate very well up until 2-3 years ago.

A good portion of my day is spent thinking and worrying about sexual things, and I feel a great anxiety that stresses me to the core. I'm starting to be somewhat uncomfortable in any situation, no matter who I'm with, because there is this nagging sexual component to every thought I have. That's what it seems like. My mind always finds a way, no matter what I'm doing, to get back to the sexual thoughts that I'm trying so hard to avoid. It's even getting harder and harder to relax and enjoy the time I spend with my closest friends, people who I've always delighted in the company of. Every morning I wake up thinking about sex, which basically ruins my day right from the start.

I also feel guilt because the fantasies I have are sometimes wrong, as they occasionally involve underage girls as the object of my fantasy. I HATE thinking about anybody as a mere means to my personal satisfaction, especially very young persons who have no way to reciprocate a sexual feeling. It's perverse. I never wanted to be like this before, and I don't want to be like this now.

 (I don't pose a threat to young persons, I should be very clear about that. I've never had a sexual urge about any real child that I've been in the presence of. In fact none of my sexual thoughts about anyone have turned into physical actions involving other people. I masturbate, I look at regular adult pornography if needed, and I won't allow myself to do anything more. I'm actually a very nice guy, or so I try to be. I'm shy and I treat everybody with respect, I like to make people laugh, I believe have good morals, I don't associate with anyone who engages in illegal or life-damaging activities, I don't do drugs or drink, I'm gentle, I go for long walks because I like being outside, I prefer to watch happy and positive TV and movies rather than all the mainstream stuff which is always so grim and depressing, etc. All in all, I like to see and think about things in a positive light at every opportunity.)

I just want to go back to the way things were years ago, when sex was something that wouldn't cross my mind for weeks at a time, and I could delight in all my hobbies without some dark sector of my mind pressuring me into sexual fantasy. Nowadays it feels like everything I do is a desperate attempt to get away from sexual thoughts and distract myself.

Do you have any advice for managing sexual thoughts? Right now I try my best to avoid sexually-charged media, sexual conversations or humor with people online or offline, and if I masturbate I make sure that I don't use any morally wrong (or illegal) pornographic materials as a visual aid. Even though I can't seem to control my THOUGHTS very well, I hope that by controlling my ACTIONS and behaving like a normal person, my mind will take the hint and follow suit.

I'm sure there's more I can do, and I am willing to do whatever I can to put a stop to this sexual anxiety, even if I have to drastically alter the way I live my life. I'm at my wits end here, so to speak. If you need any further information about my circumstances in order to give a better response, I'll be happy to supply.

PS) I'm not looking for some bogus religious method of ""spiritually cleansing"" myself or whatever. I don't believe in any gods, and I cannot pretend otherwise. I'm sure there are plenty of non-religious options for someone in my situation, I just don't know what they are.

Hey there, first post. I regularly browse, but I finally have a reason to post... Heres a bit about myself and my situation.
   I am 20 years old, enjoy reading, am often described as intelligent and am a fast food restaurant manager, also I have a history of alcohol dependence. I'm married to a marine who is about my age. She and I have been together for 2 years, and are about 3 months married. The problem here is that she has been sort of distant lately, not texting me much and not making time to call me.

I've been putting in a lot of extra effort to talk to her, but I feel like it isn't doing much. This is not the norm.

She is flying down in 2 days and we have christmas together, and she says that this behavior is due to her being busy packing, planning, etc. 

Well the problem here is that I have been seriously depressed for the time that she has been acting like this. I have reoccurring dreams where I can't find her, I feel down all the time and have issues caring about anything, and I'm sleeping an average of about 11-13 hours a day. I feel like she isn't putting in the effort she was before, and I've become dependent on her emotionally.

""An old Cherokee is teaching his grandson about life. ""A fight is going on inside me,"" he said to the boy.

""It is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves. One is evil - he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego."" He continued, ""The other is good - he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. The same fight is going on inside you - and inside every other person, too.""

The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, ""Which wolf will win?""

The old Cherokee simply replied, ""The one you feed.""""

It really made me stop in my tracks. Every feeling that the 'Evil' wolf represented was a feeling that I could clearly recall. UK btw.

Anger: A general feeling that overarches and is the product of the remaining feelings. It's a background noise that never surfaces.
Envy: I envy the offspring of richer families, parents of small business owners for example, who live comfortably in their reserved spots in their family's company. I accept that this is just the way things are, but that does not negate the feeling of Envy. I envy those who with cash who are given it on a plate.
Sorrow: This feeling comes from a lack of hope. I don't have a plan for the future and I can't see further than one week ahead, really. I have a good job and a roof over my head, living happily with parents, because I love them, though I'd leave home if there was any point. Feels like I'm just waiting for the months to tick away and watch my savings slowly grow without anything to actually do with them. A helpless feeling.
Regret: I'm 23 and never had a proper girlfriend, but that's only because women's signals tend to fly straight over my head. I feel like I'm missing a piece that makes that social interaction work, but instead I'm just standing solidly on my own. I'm used to it! I had plenty of chances to make something of girls' who were attracted to me, and mutually so, but I didn't. I never act, and so regret is right up there.
Greed: I obsess over money and constantly thinking ways to really strike it big. Peculiarly, this is driven by the desire to make my parents financially independent and worry-free, with myself secondary. I don't gouge friends for money or hassle them if they owe me anything, but at the end of the day I think far too much about how to make money and not enough time just enjoying life.
Arrogance, superiority and ego: I lump these three together as they're virtually the same. I am deeply competitive and take great pride in the things I can do better than all my friends, as if it gives me a claim to importance or dominance. Sometimes I point out when a friend's prediction is later seen to be incorrect, like a cheap little potshot 'told you so'. I hate this, and I wrestle my personality not to get carried away.
Self-pity: Well, this one's a no-brainer as I'm writing this link with the pretension that I'm somehow damaged or wrong. I'm not, and I know that, but my Gremlin is here to stay until I make something dramatic happen to get free of it. Self-pity feeds straight into doubt, and I have so much doubt and tentativity about my convictions that I think way too much. I'm a good guy with good ideas but I rarely make them happen.
Resentment: If there's anyone I resent, it's my consciousness. Always coming up with some scumbag thought or seeding doubt. I have no enemies other than myself.
Inferiority: I feel this one, even though I know it's just perception at play. I never went to university and I feel the pang of being left behind whenever I remind myself that this person's been to uni, that person, that person. I know I can do great things without a degree - anyone can - but any high-potential person who is about to make an assault on the next project will surely understand that a label can be so powerful to your confidence.

My Evil wolf wants to make me think that everyone else has a plan but me, that I somehow have consigned myself to lag behind or fail in my eventual bid for independence. He says that I am bound to wallow in indecision forever, and that's how I've felt these past couple of years. An idle mind feeds the evil wolf, but I know that in actual fact I've acheived great things so far and that I'm simply punishing myself to ridiculous standards and not focusing on living.

The Good wolf. He's had a poor couple of years.

Joy: Not a lot to be joyous about in particular. Sometimes a bubble rises to the surface when I remind myself that I've got a low-stress job with a great boss and a real sense of contribution, which is so important. But overall it's been work, sleep, work, sleep, work, sleep, work, sleep and the occasional gathering with friends, usually every weekend, for us all the fight the boredom, but I love every minute of that and I am always present. Friends take centre stage because I've got time for all of them.
Peace and Love: Peace must mean contentment. Not much of that, because I feel like I am hesitating to make important strides to becoming a proper, fully-fledged adult. I dislike my brother because his attitude is dire and he is constantly grinding down my parents with problems and general apathy. I talk to him as little as I can. He's nearly 30, and lives at home with us. It's awkward not feeling like you can have a conversation with a full-grown man without fearing a snidey rebuttal or pseudo-tantrum. He's the very definition of a teenager in a man's body. Not much love there, either, then. As for love-love, I haven't been very successful there but I know that it's not because of who I am, it's because of dumb luck, or lack of it. It takes a collection of things to slot together for love to strike, and that just hasn't happened yet. I've missed chances (Regret), though I don't seem to learn from them. My head knows that I've nothing to worry about, but my heart worries for the future, as does everyone's. I know that it will bump into me at some point. I'm not trying to guess when.
Humility and Generosity: Two things that I, at my core, have in spades. When they take the reins, I feel at my best. I love to give my time to my friends, but is that simply to remind them why I'm good to have around?

This is all just a rant on a keyboard, but I feel like I've stalled as result of my Evil wolf's dominance. I feel without hope or a plan, though I could make one tomorrow.

From this point on, this supposedly native american saying will rule my philosophy. I read the signs of the evil wolf and each one resonated, but it's time to stop feeding it.",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_11uqfz,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/11uqfz/which_of_your_wolves_is_winning/,

And I'm severely depressed and I'm afraid his 'prophecy' may come true one day. A few extremely close family members are pretty ill and they kind of need me to be there for them and give them every bit of my time which makes actually living a daunting task. I love my family and I would sacrifice everything for them. And I have. Reddit, I am restraining myself from drastically altering my life for the worse because these family members are sick and they need me. I'm afraid of what happens when they get better and no longer need me or something bad happens to one of them. I feel like the shittiest person to exist because in the back of my mind, I hold resentment toward them for keeping me alive. I hate this world and try as I might, I can't stop caring and I can't stop hurting and I want it all to stop. But I'm stuck here.

I was sexually abused at a young age by a close friend (the same age as me) and only got the courage to tell my mother last year. She told me she suspected it but never really knew and apologized profusely for not stopping it somehow. I never blamed her for a second, even though I knew she had some slight idea.
She's got some kind of brain disorder that leaves her paralyzed anywhere from 10 seconds to an hour in times of high stress. She was on a medication for her 'episodes' that left her severely depressed and she ended up a few years ago discussing with me the plans of her suicide. She went out of town for the weekend and told me she was going to OD and she was sorry but she had to do it for herself because she was tired for living for other people. She obviously came back (had a change of heart, apparently). Since then, she has been taken off the depression medication and since has not told me of any suicidal behavior. She's now living with my grandparents who are both very old and neither are going to live much longer. This leaves me to take care of my sister who suffers from Multiple Sclerosis. She has to have 24-hour supervision so when her husband is at work (most of the time) I am there to keep an eye on her, make sure she eats, revive her when she passes out, etc. I'm 20. 

These things keep me barely hanging on. I feel like I'm dead already but somehow my body has been reanimated and I'm just here to help my family and nothing more. I want to further my life, but I feel like my carefully constructed mask is going to fall apart and I'm scared I'm going to do something stupid one day out of desperation. 
I believe in reincarnation and I just want to be done with this life and start over. But I can't. And I need to know I'm not alone in feeling this way.
I mean, I've heard of people who want to die, but none necessarily who feel like they can't. And I just really don't want to continue to feel like dying all the time. 
I can't afford health care and I don't have insurance and I'm waiting to qualify for it but I've had this massive string of panic attacks in the past two days and I'm just really scared.
Getting the help I KNOW I need would require me to stay in a hospital and that would leave my sister without anyone to care for her, which would put more stress on my mother and I really don't want her to become depressed again.

TL;DR: I am severely depressed, having suicidal thoughts and getting proper help is too expensive and would screw up my family.

I AM SO FUCKING TRAPPED.

I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to believe that I will be able to walk this process without establishing a point of self-stability and self-trust which can only be accumulated and developed through consistently applying and living my self-forgiveness and self-corrective application to one point at a time release the systems and limitations that I have allowed myself to become throughout the years of my life.

I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to not see or realize that the process that I am walking is specific to my own life and my own points of accumulation as separation and backchat and thus I am in a specific time-line and allocation within this reality – meaning I am only able to walk my own specific process because the points that I have allowed myself to be controlled by are specific to my particular placement within this world and are influenced by the extent to which certain systems have manifested within me – thus it is impossible to compare my process to the process that is walked by another even if it appears to me that another being is doing 'better' or 'ahead' of me or somehow just 'better than me' because I perceive them to have transcended points that I struggle with or perceive them as easily being able to handle, face, and direct the points that I struggle with – not considering their specific placement or time-line as the life experiences that they have had or the relationship dynamics that have been in place for that particular being and only seeing what I project upon the other being as the points that I have not yet walked and have not taken responsibility for, which blinds me from seeing the other being for who and what they are unconditionally but rather as a symbol and 'guidepost' which I judge myself by and react to based on whether or not I believe the other being is 'better than me' due to perceiving them to have walked through or are 'easily directing' points that I experience difficulty with and have not fully integrated yet.

I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to compare myself to others and to believe that I am doing it all wrong, without considering the fact that I am in a specific allocation within reality and as such I have had a specific time-line of events and experiences as well as specific relationship placements that have influenced my development into and as my particular mind-consciousness system, and within this there may be innumerable factors that must be considered as to how my specific mind consciousness system developments and integrations differ from another being, and within this to not see the point that it is ultimately irrelevant whether the points that I face are easy for other beings or whether other beings have already made progress in transcending what I am still walking and facing because the relevant point is that I walk my process no matter what, because I am the only being able to walk my process - thus I do not allow myself to use the process of others as comparisons.

I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to allow backchat and spitefulness and jealousy toward other beings whom I have believed and perceived to 'have it all going right' and appear to me within my perception to have 'better lives' and 'better relationships' when I am actually projecting onto the other beings what I see in my life would be better if I were to transcend and remove the points of limitation that I see within myself and to become angry at myself for having accepted these limitations in the first place, and to thus project my self-anger and fear outward as jealousy and spite upon other beings who I perceive and believe to not be facing, not having to face, or have already transcended what I experience difficulty with in terms of my own process.

I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to believe that because the tools and practical steps of process are the same for everyone, that it means the points we each must face and walk must be the same, and thus if another being does not face what I am facing or does not appear to me to have the same hang-ups or dysfunctions within a certain specific point, then it means that they somehow 'got through it' and are 'better' than me because I apparently haven't been able to 'get through' that specific point, again not realizing here the specificity of our process in terms of the individual time-lines, relationships, and accumulations that each must walk which are multi-dimensional in nature and cannot be compared within a point-to-point basis according to my own definitions within my own mind, based on my own points of self-reference.

I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to diminish myself and trap myself within comparing myself to others and becoming frustrated when I perceive and believe that another being has transcended a certain point or have developed a certain skill or ability, or achieved a certain task that I would like to achieve or attain, not seeing that this is my own point of self-separation and that I am the only one able to give to me, to develop and express as me, that which I allowed myself to separate myself from in the first place.

I've done a ton of soul-searching. I've been relatively alone the whole time, and I've meditated, thought introspectively, and battled to find some clarity. 

I have many self-destructive tendencies:

* I smoke.
* I over-eat.
* I don't exercise.
* I don't wake up on time.
* I don't practice my passion.
* My relationships aren't the best.

So I've been really spending time on my own to figure out what ""makes me tick"" and why I behave the way I do. 

Now for a little back-story. =P

When I was like 9 my mom and dad divorced and my dad moved 2,000 miles away. The day my dad left, he picked me up early for school, took me to get ice cream, told me that he loved me very much and then dropped me off for school and left. He's lived that far away ever since. 
 
I would go and see him for Christmas and sometimes in the summer, and I would hate going back home because I had to walk away from him at the airport. I would cry for weeks after I got back home; I'd just lay in bed and watch tv and escape to my own little world.

Long story short, both of my parents would ""guilt trip"" me into wanting to stay with them and I felt really torn all the time knowing that wherever I chose to go, I was also choosing to not have the other person in my life on a daily basis. I ended up on anti-depressants and in therapy, which helped me a lot. 

Fast-forward 10 years, and I've **finally** found that the root of my unhappiness is this dichotomy. It seeps into everything that I am, and how I see myself and others. It takes away from the things that I do and the passions that I have. 

**I finally came to terms with the fact that I can't control it, and it's never going to go away.**

So my question to you self-helpers is what are good, solid ways to cope with this type of situation? (By that I mean constantly feeling torn between two places, and two very important people.) What can I do to feel whole again?

It was a sales position so I was more of a coordinator than a producer - there wasn't a lot of focused attention required just a lot of activity. That, combined with my natural love of the 'nets, is now causing me problems in my new role, where I'm expected to produce work that takes a lot of focused concentration. 

I've been soooooo frustrated over the past few months trying to adjust to this new role and have almost come to the conclusion that I've made myself stupid over the past few years and have lost the ability to think for long periods. How can I retrain myself to stay focused? I actually get a physical, pit in my stomach kind of feeling when faced with tasks that will required a few days of steady, constant focus. I break them up with tons of reddit and other breaks that really distract me. Has anyone else coped with this kind of thing?

tl;dr Has the Internet made me stupid? How do I learn to think again?

Update: I've forced myself to work in 20 minute chunks - NO MATTER WHAT - and then get up for some water, visit someone else, stare at my todo list, whatever, even browse the nets if I want, but only for 5 minutes and then back on the clock. Originally I thought this was still too much time wasting but for tasks that take a lot of concentration it seems about right and is certainly less than I was wasting before.

I always wanted to do lots of things. Draw, sculpt, play guitar, write some fun programs, electronics stuff, etc. Really, a load of things.

I tried some guitar and drawing lessons for a little extra push, but that didn't work. I always end up not being able to muster the energy/willpower/whatever to actually do it.

Primarily however this affects my marriage and that my wife is very devoted and compassionate, especially to me. I however do not reciprocate this nearly enough, and and often very self-centered, and tend to forget about the wants and needs of others. 

When I take a step back I can see these issues plain as day, but in the day-to-day I rarely remember and usually end up pushing my wife to breaking point and it all erupts. Due to my ego I tend to get very defensive during these events and fight back, and generally don't take criticism well at all, so what could be 5 minutes of my wife letting me know what I'm doing and me apologizing, I immediately bite back and the argument lasts half a day.

My first thoughts are something along the lines of couseling or therapy  however money doesn't flow as much as I'd like, so I thought perhaps some books or online resources might be a good start to get me on the right path so I can at least become maybe a bit more prepared when I do start to seek out some more active help, if not better.

I know that this isn't a healthy way to interact with people or think and hinders my growth as a person. Does anyone know of a way that I can provoke behavioral modification to think in more positive ways? Thanks.

Anecdotally, I've noticed that in the past discussing my fears, my failings, my unhappiness, my self-hatred, etc. can do a lot more harm than good, whereas making a goal or picking up a new hobby (e.g. painting) makes me feel a lot better. Big surprise, right?

I don't mean to discount the value that I've received from opening up to a friend, visiting a counsellor, or ruminating in my journal, but I think there's something to be said about the evils of too much rumination.

We all have a range of issues and I don't mean to extrapolate or equate my issues to all other persons, but I've noticed that learning a new lesson, discovering a new breathing exercise, or focusing on my ability to *do* something to resist unhappiness helps me feel better, quicker.

Years ago in high school, I had a best friend with whom I would frequently discuss self-harm, disordered eating, depression, etc. I don't know when it clicked, but I realized that the whole thing made me feel incredibly shitty and one day when I was feeling particularly terrible I asked her that we not talk about it for a week or so and I started to feel better--not instantly, but there were noticeably fewer dark days. 

As I've gotten a bit older, the trend has continued and I tend to avoid excessive rumination. That's not to say that 8 years later I don't continue to have rough patches and a fairly consistent fight against anxiety, but these days I feel like I'm mostly winning.

Has anyone else experienced a similar experience? I feel like the traditional mantra is that we need to discuss our emotional issues, engaging in endless conversations about how shitty we feel. A complete unwillingness to be thoughtful and emotional isn't recommended--but I think that there's something to be said about shutting up and doing what you can to turn your mind to something far more pleasant.",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_19ikww,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/19ikww/talking_too_much_more_harmful_than_helpful/,

No denying I'm good at my current job, but anybody who is able to interact with people and has some common sense can be good at working in retail, and I find it a little hard to believe that this is my only skill.

I have no hobbies to speak of, unless you count mindlessly surfing the web or watching TV, and I don't have many friends. I don't drink alcohol so I find socialising with my age group a little difficult. I can't sing or play an instrument and I am not in any way artistic or creative.

When you think you're undeniably right, ask yourself ""What might I be missing here?"" If we could truly figure it all out, what else would there be left to do?

2. Excellence is an unrelenting struggle, but it's also the surest route to enduring satisfaction. Amy Chua, the over-the-top ""Tiger Mother,"" was right that there's no shortcut to excellence. Getting there requires practicing deliberately, delaying gratification, and forever challenging your current comfort zone.

3. Emotions are contagious, so be fully aware of how you're feeling and what effect its having on others around you. Think of the best boss you ever had. How did he or she make you feel? That's the way you want to make others feel.

4. When in doubt, ask yourself, ""How would I behave here at my best?"" We know instinctively what it means to do the right thing, even when we're inclined to do the opposite. If you find it impossible, in a challenging moment, to envision how you'd behave at your best, try imagining how someone you admire would respond.

5. If you do what you love, the money may or may not follow, but you'll love what you do. It's magical thinking to assume you'll be rewarded with riches for following your heart. What it will give you is a richer life. If material riches don't follow, and you decide they're important, there's always time for Plan B.

6. You need less than you think you do. All your life, you've been led to believe that more is better, and that whatever you have isn't enough. It's a prescription for disappointment. Instead ask yourself this: How much of what you already have truly adds value in your life? What could you do without?

7. Accept yourself exactly as you are but never stop trying to learn and grow. One without the other just doesn't cut it. The first, by itself, leads to complacency, the second to self-flagellation. The paradoxical trick is to embrace these opposites, using self-acceptance as an antidote to fear and as a cushion in the face of setbacks. 

8. Meaning isn't something you discover, it's something you create, one step at a time. Meaning is derived from finding a way to express your unique skills and passion in the service of something larger than yourself. Figuring out how best to contribute is a lifelong challenge, reborn every day.

9. You can't change what you don't notice and not noticing won't make it go away. Each of us has an infinite capacity for self-deception. To avoid pain, we rationalize, minimize, deny, and go numb. The antidote is the willingness to look at yourself with unsparing honesty, and to hold yourself accountable to the person you want to be.

10. When in doubt, take responsibility. It's called being a true adult.

Editor’s Note: This is a contribution by An Bourmanne

***“And in the end, it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.”* ~Abraham Lincoln**


I used to think that I would motivate myself to really live up to my full potential by reminding myself how much I wasn’t.

Well, that didn’t work.

Not that I didn’t get any results from chanting “You are so not living up to your full potential!” while getting out of bed, driving to work, doing the dishes, and combing my hair. Any time was a great time to remind myself. So I didn’t waste a second doing just that.

And I got results. Only not the ones I expected.

I became an expert on mindlessly browsing the web. I became an expert on constantly comparing myself to other people. I became an expert on feeling stuck. I became an expert on driving myself crazy with my non-stop “you are so stuck” chatter in my mind.

I felt drained, stuck, and low on energy; these were my daily companions.

So it shouldn’t be any wonder I grew less and less fond of my so-called motivational mantra that was doing anything but, well, motivating.

I’ve realized that living up to our full potential starts with eliminating three big lies:


**Lie # 1.** It’s productive to beat ourselves up about not living up to our full potential.

When we spend all our energy telling ourselves we’re not doing good enough, we have very little time and energy left to look inside.

Don’t get me wrong, I was very busy.

I was very busy searching for my full potential. I read tons of books. I completed lots of quizzes to find my true talents and the right job for me. I browsed the job section of newspapers. I looked at what other people were doing.

In short, I was looking everywhere—except inside.

I wasn’t paying attention to what gave me energy. I wasn’t paying attention to what fascinated me.  Instead I was writing the pros and cons for potential jobs, but reaching a dead end time and again as I failed to neatly add and subtract all the items from both columns into one overwhelmingly clear answer.

I’ve come to believe that we already know what it means to us to lead a rich, meaningful, purposeful life. It’s just a matter of paying attention.

And listening to ourselves.

And taking action and checking in with ourselves to discover what feels good, what energizes us, what feels bad, what drains us, and what fascinates us.

It’s a matter of allowing ourselves to explore and experiment, one tiny step at a time. And adjusting where needed, using our energy levels and our fascination as a compass to guide us in creating an energizing, brilliant life that inspires us.


**Lie #2:**  Living up to our full potential means living a life free of fear, failure, and sorrow.

I convinced myself that living to my full potential meant living happily ever after, in some kind of perpetual state of bliss.

I’ve come to believe that this is a myth.

Living up to our full potential means feeling the fear and doing it anyway. It means realizing we are living up to our full potential because of and thanks to the mistakes we make and what we learn from them.

Living up to our full potential means seeing things as they are, not the way we think they should be—and taking action from that place.

It means allowing ourselves to feel the way we do, not the way we think we should feel.

It means diving in and exploring why we are feeling the way we do.

And that’s when we find our answers. That’s when we reconnect with our full potential. That’s when we start tapping into our brilliance.


**Lie #3:** We’re not good enough.

When we tell ourselves “You are so not living up to your full potential!” we’re basically telling ourselves “You are not good enough the way you are right now.”

And that is such a disempowering lie.

I’ve learned that it is my choice whether or not to believe that lie. It is my job to let go of that lie and choose an empowering perspective instead.

I’ve learned that I can make that choice every minute of every single day.

So that’s what I did. I made that choice.  And that’s what I do, time and again.

I’m being the best me I can be, right here, right now.

I’ll be thriving tomorrow thanks to the mistakes I am willing to make today.

Living up to our full potential is not trying to avoid making mistakes. It’s giving it our all, wholeheartedly, with all we’ve got.

I am now reconnecting with my full potential through everything I do.

I choose to explore. I choose to explore me. I choose me.

Living up to my full potential is doing my thing, one tiny step at a time, at my pace, in my own fabulous, imperfect way.

Some will like it, some won’t. Living up to my full potential is being cool with that instead of trying to please everyone else.

I’m done living someone else’s life. Living up to my full potential is giving myself permission to be who I am, and tapping into my unique me.

I feel empowered, scared and excited, proud and determined, playful and inspired; these are just a few of my new daily companions on this long, fascinating, winding road that is living up to my full potential.

And they didn’t come into my life by accident. I choose to invite them in. One empowering thought at a time.

And so can you.

I can't remember having ever done anything serious to approach a woman at all (except talking unsuccessfully to woman in bars). I suppose the woman were just more desperate in their late teens than they are in their mid twenties. You see, all the woman in my life (not too many) came to me, and, as they all told me later on, I didn't show them the slightest bit of interest until they had me thoroughly convinced that they liked me. But I really did like them from the first moment on. The more I like someone the less I try to talk with them. It's not voluntary. I just subconsciously pull away. I am not sure if it's regular shyness either. 

I don't have big problem in talking to strangers, including woman. I am however completely incapable of making these approches romantic, or taking the step from friendliness to flirting. I know that there are techniques and books and and a whole industry built around this problem, and I have read and tried some stuff and been temporarily motivated. But these days I am just fatigued by even a slight mention of ""the game"" or pick-up techniques that I know can work, but which I have come to see as boring, exhausting and completely out of sync with my personality. Looking logically at it I agree just as much as the next guy with sentiments like ""nothing to lose"" and ""plenty of fish in the sea"", but when the light of day comes about, it just feels like a dreadful chore to have to try to flirt. I asume that if my current drought period lasts much longer, I might grow desperate enough to start seeing the value of trying more, but right now it feels like I could live the rest of my life in solitude, and still view it as too dreadful a task to find a woman.

I've been diagnosed with MDD, social/general anxiety, fearful-avoidant attachment style and I'm taking wellbutrin xl 300mg.



My mother was my main abuser; let's do a quick rundown of her first; (she turned 45 last month)
-7 siblings; six brothers; second youngest
-abandoned by her mom, and dad would whip and abuse her
-was in poverty and whole family lived in an old two-room schoolhouse; was raped at 13
-bipolar and alcoholic, not on medication
-was sexually promiscuous for most of my life



Let's do a quick rundown on me;
I have two brothers; my full-blood brother is extremely antisocial and does whatever he can to recieve attention, positive or not.
 My parents divorced at 13; they tried when I was 10 but never went through with it. my father is emotionally distant, reclusive, very artistic. Extremely paranoid and will board up the windows of his house. I was beaten regularly from around 11 to when i moved out at 19; I sent to middle/high school covered in bruises and told to lie about them (which was why CPS never took me away), my mother actively kept me from making friends, stating that she was all I needed. She told me and my brother that she hated us because we were half of our dad and she hates our dad, and if she got worked up enough (which happened whenever she was drunk which was often), she would kick down our doors after we would lock ourselves in our room and drag us out by whatever part she could grab first. She would pin us, punch, kick, throw knives and pots and anything she could get her hands on at us. From before I could remember to around 11 years, my parents would regularly get into fist fights. My mom would injure herself and even did it on front of my brother once, when he was 4 (he's 20 now, he didn't tell me about this until last year) to lie to the cops to get my dad thrown in jail. my grandmother (dad's mom) took protective custody of me and my brother when we were in the 4th/5th grade. Mom would try to kidnap us back fairly often. if one of us was being focused on during a beating, the other would jump on her and pry her off. My mom's ex-boyfriend molested me repeatedly from 14-16. I thought it was normal, given my past, so I let it happen. Until he watched me take a shower, and then I did something about it. He justified it by saying that I ""tempted him"" and saying that ""I was molested, so it's okay"". I started cutting at 16 (who didn't, though) and attempted suicide. I have stopped this. I didn't start dating and lost my virginity to someone I hated at 18; i wanted men to approve of me so I would force men I didn't even like into relationships. In 3 years, I went through and singlehandedly destroyed 7 relationships and had 8 sexual partners total.



so here's what I ask you, reddit;

1) what do you tell yourself every day, to keep going? 

2) Relationship advice. I went through a bit of therapy in the end of last year and I'm doing better, but I'm still doing bad and now I have a loving boyfriend. I try to subconsciously find reasons to break up with him because I can't trust him. I attack him and I have no idea why he is still with me. In my mind, every other girl that exists is more attractive, not mentally ill, and better than I am. I want to make us work because he's the first man i've wanted to date but I'm afraid that I'll destroy it. When I'm doing okay, our relationship is fantastic.

3) How do you even learn to fully trust people?

4) Is it possible for me to eventually be content with life, and be 'normal' ?

5) I also need advice on how to communicate with people. My boyfriend (David) says that I tend to deflect conversations a lot.


I can't type anymore right now, I need to find a distraction. I'll be back, though.

obvs a throwaway.

I took it because I was good at it. I can do math fine, and have no problem regurgitating formulas. However, in the last couple of years I've realized that I have never been very intellectual. So I started reading a lot more, watching more 'smart' films, and generally trying to improve the way I think about things. 

Well, it's not working. I can *read* a good book, but I don't understand it, and often forget what even happened after two weeks. I don't have favorite books or movies because none of them stick with me. I enjoy reading and watching them, but somehow I can't get to the bottom *meaning* of the book/film, somehow I miss the themes, miss the satire, miss everything. Sometimes I think that I can't appreciate characters because I don't appreciate people in my own life enough. And it's not a question of why not, it's a question of how. I simply can't see a *person* as a combination of likes/dislikes/morals/personality and just classify them as their activities or profession. 

I don't know why I can't watch a great film and like or dislike it. I just end up relying on reviews I read, or people I talk to. I don't even have opinions anymore. My mind feels like it is full and empty at the same time. There's no more room for anything, but there's nothing there anyway. I feel detached from the world, like I can't relate to it, like I don't *care* about anything. To be clear, I'm pretty stable psychologically, just frustrated.

",11,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/sipj7/dreams_about_your_ex_is_this_common_why_is_it/,"I am trying to understand why I would be having dreams about my ex husband. We left on bad terms and have not spoken in about 6 years.

Some Background: 

 The marriage ended as a result of the revelation of several lies he told me. This pattern of lies began when we were dating and continued when we were married. I never suspected anything was amiss until one day when I found a secret bank statement. That opened the flood gates. Pretty much everything he had told me about several subjects was untrue. 

There was no infidelity that I am sure of, although I did have my suspicions later that it was likely. This was my second marriage.  I decided after this one that I am allergic to marriage and have resolved to remain single.

 I sometimes miss having a partner to do things with but as I failed so miserably to find the right guy, it is not worth going through that again. I am, for the most part, ok to be by myself. When awake, if I happen to think about my ex it is with disdain and I generally send him a silent ""fuck you"". 

The Dreams:

Two nights in a row, I have dreamed that we were in love and getting married. None of the bad feelings that existed during our last years together were present. In fact the dreams are so nice I really hate to wake up from them.  

Waking Up:

When I wake up, I am horrified. This man ruined my life and deserted my child. He did nothing except fuck with me from the day he left. After 6 months of nonstop awful, I finally told him the next time I heard from him I would get a restraining order. I realize I have a lot of unresolved anger, but I can not imagine why that would cause me to dream we were in love after all of this time.

1328294878.0,9,self.selfhelp,p9kni,"Post-university social life implossion...or inevitable conclusion, what do?",9,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/p9kni/postuniversity_social_life_implossionor/,"So, I'm a guy in his mid-twenties with little of a social life. I'm no fool in that i blame anyone but myself for this situation. I have some very good friends from my time at university, but most of them are now in serious relationships were couple activities are most common. I don't think they're making a conscious effort of excluding me, but I guess I'm just not a regular part of that clique. Granted we still spend time together, but obviously it's been marginalized rather heavily considering all the other people they keep up with. Naturally they all also have friends outside of this group, however I do not. Simply put, the people I knew before I started university were not really my friends. We did not enjoy each others company but I didn't know anyone else at the time so when I met my now friends, it made little sense to maintain any contact.

I should also mention that I've never really had a large group of people I spend time with, and I've always been a very introvert person. This also reflects on relationships, as I've only been in two my entire life (both of them very short). I'm sure you can see where this is going... I have terrible self-esteem and I'm becoming more and more isolated every day. Previously I've been quite good at simply accepting this (I very much enjoy playing video games on my own etc) but as I've gotten slightly older, I notice the feeling of loneliness is only getting worse. Many times have I thought that I should get out more, go on dates, meet people and stop feeling sorry for myself. However, I then remember why I'm so afraid; I hardly have any relationship experience and I'm a virgin. But it's not that simple - my personal regions are quite bent - in fact so bent that when I met my first girlfriend (I was 18) we could not have sex. I even went to a doctor whom recommended surgery (which I had) to correct this, but as the healing progressed my personal area returned to it's previous shape. I had, for other reasons, broken up with my first girlfriend before I had the surgery though so I simply tried not to think of it.

Then, about 4 years later (I basically studies and played video games in-between) I got chronic prostatitis. (Basically chronic swelling and inflammation of your prostate). Eventually it passed, but not before I left me a final parting gift: incontinence. It's not like I wee myself, but once I go to the bathroom, well, it's like a tap that wont quite shut for another hour or so. I'm sure you again can see where this is going. With these issues and an already incredibly shitty self esteem I became even more hesitant to talk to women other than professionally or platonic. Finally, a few years after this happened I got diagnosed with irritable colon. Long story short, constant uneasy/painful feeling in the stomach, always gassy and generally very uncomfortable. Again, denting my self-confidence.

In the midst of this I did meet (somehow) another girl which I did get into a form of relationship with, but it was rather strange, as her English was not that good - she was also a devout catholic and I'm an atheist... but I was desperately lonely. Anyway, eventually we get into bed together and once again I'm unable to perform. Not because I'm nervous (well okay I was) but because well, bent + slightly slack = not very easy. Soon thereafter she moved back to her home-country which ended the relationship. I did all I could to hide my bodily issues from her and due to her job and the fact that we hadn't been seeing each other for long, I managed quite well (although I think she suspected). Since then I've basically not even tried meeting anyone else. I haven't told anyone about all these problems and I'm not sure what I should do. I don't dare go out dating/whatnot because this will probably come up before there's real trust. Not that I think I'd be laughed at, but honestly, who'd really want to date a guy with that much baggage and no experience?

Finally always being alone and not having any friends whom I trusted for the first ~19 years has led me to consciously avoid any dependence on others. Likewise, I try to avoid any situation where others could depend on me. I'm deathly worried that I'd disappoint someone, should they depend on me and I feel like I'm exploiting someone if I depend on them. I'm also almost always worried I will fail - I avoid any form of competition and even watching others compete is emotionally stress-full.

I don't know what to do. I thought about things like taking dance classes or similar, but with my bodily issues, I get really worried. It's not that I don't exercise, I do, it's just that I do it on my own so as to not embarrass myself and pester others. I always tried to tell myself that alone I am strong, and that there's more to the world that relationships, but I don't think it's working anymore. Right now what makes me hang on is that I really don't want to disappoint my parents. Professionally and academically I'm quite successful and I do my best to maintain a facade of mental well being around them (and my friends when I do meet them) but I'm not sure it will work for much longer. I've never told anyone this (my parents know of my physical issues, but they think I'm coping) and I never felt like I've had someone I could have told. I'm not really sure what this will accomplish, but I at least I did write it down. Granted if you have any tips on how you managed to get out of a similar situation I'd love to hear. Again, I am not blaming anyone else but myself for this, but I simply don't have the confidence to break out of the spiral myself.

**TL;DR**: Introvert uni-grad losing social life. Virgin, incontinent, irritable colon, horrible self-esteem. What do?

Ex: column 1: 6+ min early, column 2: 0-5 min early, column 3: late

I am late to almost everything, good or bad, so this is my own personal goal.  So far doing good:) my goal is 40 points and at the end I reward myself.  I wrote that on back of card:)

I tried several ways, but found this works for me.  I look at it like a game so it seems less intimidating and it pushes myself so I can get my reward.  Reward part helpful to me personally as I normally punish myself without knowing...or don't feel like I deserve to be happy or get anything I want.

**I’m 22. 
Not terribly handsome, but certainly not ugly. 
I dress pretty well and I’m relatively fit. 
I receive good grades and study at a fairly well renowned university.** 

**I wish I was like “Mensa-clever”, but I am more like a bit above average clever. 
I think I have great taste in film, music and literature, but this is the first time I brag about it. 
I am quite neutral when it comes to politics and religion, but interested in discussing it.** 

**I am not very good at making people laugh, but at least I try. 
All in all I would say I am quite balanced.**

Like most men in my situation my main problem is probably lack of self-confidence, and being too shy. I have been taking anti-depressants for the last year. This is not directly related to my love problems, but I was hoping they would help me change some of my behavior. Lately I have been doing stuff I normally wouldn’t do, like travel alone, going out more and meeting strangers. How much this is related to the anti-depressants I don’t know, but like the name indicates, the main effect has only been to ease my depression. I mostly behave just like I used to. 

Eight months have passed since I broke up with my high school sweetheart. I can’t say I have ever been close to finding a new girl since then. We were together for four years. In total I have been in two relationships. Both the girls I’ve been with took heavy initiative at the beginning, so I can’t say I’ve ever been very outgoing with woman. 

I have however gotten confirmation that I can be “that person” that people seem to categorically appreciate. Even hot girls. When I drink I usually become a bit depressed. But once in a while I experience a boost of self-confidence and sociability. I haven’t really used this surge of social awesomeness to directly hit on a girl, but I have certainly gotten a few interested. Just a few weeks ago a really hot one at my university was exhilarated when she saw me on the street, a few days after we met at a party. She came over with a wide smile on her face to hug me. It’s not the first time something like this has happened. And just as before I somehow manage to bring down all the social xp in a short minute. I try to be friendly a forthcoming, but it’s the same procedure as every year. She seems to need just a few seconds to realize that I am not really “that person” she met at the party. And I can in fact see how that genuine smile in her face quickly fades, to be substituted with a very false one. When I see her today she barely says hello. It’s not a huge loss, as despite of her hotness, she is not really the kind of person I would like to be with, but I think it greatly illustrates my problem with girls. 

Or take this. When I fall in love I am usually so shy and awkward about just speaking to that person that I may end up appearing mildly retarded when I finally do. It’s like my brain keeps saying: “oh my god, there she is! The girl you are really into. Now is the time! Impress her. Say something clever! Or something funny! Do it! Do it! Do it!” And the pressure just consumes everything and gives me existential angst. It hits like the stupefy curse from HP. On one particular occasion my bowels started making all kinds of loud noises just as I began talking to a girl I liked. And it just wouldn’t stop. But when it comes to girls that I am not attracted to, there’s no troll brain making things difficult. I am still mildly shy at the beginning, but it’s usually not a huge problem to just relax and be oneself among them. Thus, most of the girls I have absolutely no romantic feelings for seem to think I am a great guy. And not all of them are ugly :)

It feels like I am a pioneer in trying to cope with this particular set of problems, but I realize that most of this must sound familiar to other guys. The usual response is to “just suck it up. Get out there. Talk to all kinds of girls. You will gradually build confidence. And just don’t give a damn if you fail a few times.” I have tried several times. The problem is that I can force myself to talk to girls. I know how to not give damn. The antidepressants have done that quite easy. But I can’t force my body to stop inducing physical pain while doing it, and I can’t force myself to be charming while doing it. So that’s why I mostly don’t do it anymore. Except for when I am the socially awesome drunk penguin. 

Besides I am not really in to ploughing through hot girls in a club until I find someone who is hot and willing. How a girl looks like is important, but there is much more to it. And when I once in a while really fall in love, it doesn’t feel like you can just move on to the next one. She can be somewhat unique. So for now I am forever alone, and I can’t see how that’s going to change in the foreseeable future.  

TLDR: Too shy to talk with girls I am in to. Have tried to do it anyway, but it's always awkward as I keep cracking up, and it's in no way helping me build self-confidence. For now I am forever alone.

This is going to be a bit long, hopefully well written, and helpful.

First my story/example.

I was at an Applebees with my mum and little brother, I had just moved into this town and knew nobody. I was not sleeping well, felt bored with life, and all around bad about it all. Back to the Applebees tho. They had this jukebox to pay and play your song over the restaurant speakers. I had just put on Radiohead and was looking up something to play next. While leaning up against the machine this cute short redhead girl, she was a waitress there, comes up and asked if I was the one who played Radiohead(because she liked them). I said yeah and suddenly got nervous. I knew I was going to fuck up, I was thinking of what to say and knew no matter what, it was going to be wrong. So put her on the spot instead. I asked if she would like to select the next one, my dime. She said no and sorta just looked at me. 
THIS IS BAD. I just say alright and bail, put on some of The killers and sat down. 
Sitting there and thinking, your an idiot. *Could have met somebody, could have at least talked to somebody, could have gotten off your lazy ass... Shut up brain, stop being a dick, I want to meet someone and your not helping!* I hop up, stroll over to Her and lay it on the line. ""Hey I just moved here, I don't know anyone, my name is Lewis btw. Lacy, nice to meet you, so you like Radiohead, that is cool, your the only person I have met in this one horse town that knows good music. So I know your working, but could I get your number, I would really like to know someone here in town."" Success. 

My point in all this is, if it's you getting yourself down then you need to understand. YOU are YOUR own person, and if YOUR not going to help YOURSELF then YOU are not going anywhere. You have got to get mad, you have to say, I want this because I know deep down inside I want it, and there is nothing that is going to stop me from getting it. 

With the whole girl thing/boy thing, try to find something in common, shoes, hair, bands, anything really. People like to be nice(unless they are dicks) so use it, make it seem like they can help you somehow. Make eye contact, smile, even if you hate it, your doing it all for you.

On a side note, if you get turned down then fuck them, someone who wont give someone else a single chance is someone you don't ever want to talk to, end of story. 

Accepting all question, I will help you, even if its just someone to talk to. If your really need more then a comment thread we can Skype or something.

Also, i have this horrible habit, of jumping to conclusions and blocking off all emotions from it. It leads to a horrible depression. I build emotional walls with people, and any time they try and get closer I start pushing them away. I only have her because shes said all the right shit and done all the right things at the same time.

The other day we broke up, and it was because she was moving away. I literally convinced myself that she was over me and moving on and making an elaborate excuse to not see me. Shes still in love with me, but i convinced myself, through my own thoughts, through made up conversations with people so i can sleep at night, that she cheated on me. 

This is literally ruining all my relationships, my friendships to an extent, and on top of it im so fucking shy, that unless i really know the person i cant even speak up enough to order food sometimes.

Its not low self esteem, but i feel fucking crazy. I need a way to fix this. When im acting like my best self, people love me, but thats only in situations where im very comfortable, and it takes me a while to get used to that. Public i am never comfortable. It could be anxiety.

To clarify.. Her coming over was basically a booty call, she was in skimpy clothing and everything. It was obvious, i gave her a painting i made for her. She loved it and she kissed me like she hasnt since we first started dating. She took off her pants and put on my high school football jersey. We had like 20 minutes left, i wanted to have sex so i basically said it, she said we werent going to do anything. so we just made out for a bit.

I've lost friends, that bummed me out in the beginning (now it doesn't as much)

Over the past 5 years or so I suffered from post-concussion syndrome that left me drained, depressed and so on and so forth. After a miracle-worker Dr. helped me relieve my symptoms, I have begun reintegrating myself to my old life. I am starting to feel my passion for life and energy come back and am now faced with a new problem. I have also been a hyperactive person and it is hard to sit down and find one thing to occupy myself with. I jump around from activity to activity and hobby to hobby thinking that the next one I find will be the one that I love and want to stick with. However, like a toddler, I end up putting the new toy down and moving onto something else.

All of this is paired with a lot of other quirks about me. I was laid off 6 months back and only recently began working again. During the time I was laid off, I became introspective into what I was doing at a corporate job and started to have thoughts of switching to a blue-collar type roll or just anything outside an office. In that time I even wrote a screenplay thinking that writing might be the calling that I was looking for. Now that I am working again some of these feelings are subsiding, but not totally. I realize that I am an office drone again and I fear that i am not actually using my talents to their highest potential. 

Major changes are something I often toy with in my mind but can never execute. I have poor self-esteem and have a crippling constant feeling that people don't actually like me despite having a great group of many friends. I am constantly worried that people are upset at me and I concentrate so heavily on what people think that i cannot even control my own happiness most of the times. 

I like cooking, grilling, the outdoors, talking to people, watching tv, eating and drinking but i feel like my life is missing something. Whether its career or hobby wise I cannot place it, but I feel like I so desperately want something that I look forward to constantly. I do not know how to go about any of this and I'm unsure of even where to start. It seems any time I sit down to think about it I either 1. Get nowhere or 2. get a bold idea that I forget about in the next couple days.

Usually, the dream is one where I look in a mirror and see some kind of monster. My face is warped, hair is falling in clumps, eyes are bulging, and everything is just fucked up. I'm bubbling and melting. It's really scary. And there I am , the monster, worrying about what is happening to me.

When i wake up, it's only then that I realize how bad my self-esteem issues really are, and it makes me extremely sad.

I guess I should add that I do feel extremely unwanted, ugly, and untouchable.
The hardest part about this is the nature of who I am. I'm a product designer. I understand shape, form, and function. I design beautiful things.

And then I look in the mirror sometimes and realize that my face is inherently broken. I have no facial geometry, I'm balding, my jaw is genetically misaligned and fucked up, and I have some skin problems that would make going bald difficult. (exczema on head)

It's going really badly for me. The nightmares are continuing, and it makes me realize how bad it all is even when I try to push it under the rug. Clearly, my mind doesn't know how to cope with this even when I think I am. I bet that somehow it shows in my social interactions and general confidence in life. I'm not even thinking about why I can't find a girlfriend nowadays. There's no way I can reach that point if I haven't at least figured out how to be at peace with the way I look.

I'm not asking for suggestions on how to ""love every aspect of myself"", I doubt it'll ever happen. I like that I'm creative, logical, resourceful, and extremely ambitious. I just don't think I can look in the mirror and love what I see. I just want the bad feelings to stop, and I want to give my subconscious a rest.

1372679621.0,6,self.selfhelp,1hf6ae,My Story - A brother with paranoid schizophrenia. Help and advice wanted.,9,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1hf6ae/my_story_a_brother_with_paranoid_schizophrenia/,"Hi Reddit,

My name is Joshua.

I am looking for advice or useful coping mechanisms for myself and my family where my older brother, James has acute and chronic paranoid schizophrenia.

The story.....

James is 32 and has suffered from the illness since the age of about 18. The catalyst for his downwards spiral was marijuana and possibly other drugs he was exposed to (in the later years of school) and unfortunately had a pre disposition to. My parents had James taken to hospital against his will after a series of progressively worse episodes which endangered himself, the family and others. At this time, he was uncontrollable and hateful to Dad and Mum for forcing such help on him, however he soon healed with the help of medication and psychiatric sessions - Though the resentment to Dad for the forced admission to hospital is something he has held on to for the last 14 years - 

He continued to take the medication, to a point where he was able to identify that he was unwell and eventually even thanked my parents for saving him. 

Throughout the medicated years, James grew up, joined multiple social groups and played sports. He was undoubtedly the healthiest person I knew as far as foods and exercise  He studied hard and earned multiple degrees in finance and economics which he then used to gain employment in a highly regarded Financial Planning and Securities Firm. With his knowledge and earnings, he purchased his own house, and built up an inventory of belongings. All while on medication.

During Jame's 'good' years, he would visit my parents every weekend and as a family (My sister Jane - 24 and my other brother Sam - 28 and myself - 23), we would have lunch and hang out go on camping trips and all the other family stuff.  However even during this time, the three younger kids always got along better and had more in common with each other than we did with Jame's, and because of that, he felt like an outcast in the family and has always maintain the distance and maturity of the 'older sibling' that should set good examples. My immediate family has always looked after each other, and put each other first, before friends, work and travel, and because of this, we're closer to each other than to anyone else, even at our current ages.

One morning, at age 27, James woke up and couldn't understand why he was taking medication everyday when he was doing so well. ""i'm not sick anymore"" was his words. He felt as if the medication was keeping him under the weight of a blanket that wouldn't allow him to fully stand, even though he felt he was capable of it. 

So he stopped taking the medication...

This was the beginning of a 5 year decline in Jame's thinking and rationality, health and life style, and by extension, family. 

When James decided to stop taking his medication, it wasn't long before he started hearing people at work talking about him behind his back, as well his neighbours  listening in on his phone calls, and his friends and family all conspiring against him to his detriment. Because of his increasing paranoia and strange behaviour, he became the target of bullying at work, which escalated to his being asked to resign. This was closely followed by a decision to sell his house, with enormous and unnecessary financial loss. This lead to multiple rental places in which James always found various irrational reasons to move away from, and although he had been intermittently coming back to the family home and staying just long enough to ""hate all the noise and commotion"" (of two 60 year old parents), he  finally settled in to the granny flat on the family property, where he has stayed ever since. Better than the tent his was pitching down the back in order to get away from the stress and pressure of my nothing but caring and charitable parents towards their struggling son..

Since James has had his own space in the granny flat, he will not be seen for weeks at a time, some times more, and keeps the building locked up and curtains shut at all time. He has grown unhealthy and increasingly strange. All attempts at a conversation with him are now lost, for myself, my siblings (who all moved away from home due to his eery and frighting presence) and my parents. He speaks to him self, argues and yells, breaks a lot of things around home, and commits other strange acts like damaging other peoples belongings around the house, calling the cops on out of control neighbours (an 88 year old grandmother with a old withered border collie companion) and speaking about Hitler and strange topics that have no reasoning behind them.

The family has made multiple attempts at individual (low pressure) talks as well as full family intervention talks. James has agreed at times that he is in a bit of a 'bad spot' but won't come close to admitting he has any sort of illness and always relates it back to 'tough times in the economy and hard to find work' etc.

We have tried to approach him about study options, disability pension options, or work options, but without admitting he has an illness he is not moving forward  at all. We have had visits from psychiatrists and social workers who have stated that without Jame's willingness, there is no way we can force him in to 'protective help' again as he is now an adult and has full human rights as stated by the law here in Australia.

We have been told that until we can prove in a court of law that he has hurt himself or another person, no one can make decisions on his behalf, not even a whole family of us put together. - Contradictory to this, a head psychiatrist has advised us that 'if James was to commit a crime in his current state, he would not be charged, on account of his illness...? I don't understand how these two scenarios can coexist....

Unfortunately in my eyes, I am very much seeing it as the health of one person, James, versus the health of my parents and my family, that are being torn apart more and more each passing day at a seemingly impossible situation. My parents have been married for over 40 years, and I have seen them fight twice, ever. Both in the last two years, both about James. Mum is the 'in denial overly protective mother who just wants to see James safe and at least she can ensure that in her own home' type of person, while dad is the 'we won't be around much longer and don't have the energy to keep fighting an impossible cause and have to get James help and independence' type of person. Mum, over the last 12 months has come around a lot and sees the issue as a 'short term pain for long term gain' situation now, rather than the denial she showed in earlier years.

At age 62 and 64, my parents are still working full time as teachers. Mum, in a 'special kids' faculty of a private school, while Dad tries to teach english, law and order to refugees that have floated to our country on rafts. They work so hard to make ends meet looking after them selves, their son and their future and yet little happiness or comfort.

For each month that passes, I see my parents age a year, and become more tired and weary, wasting out their days on a useless cause that will haunt them, and eventually move on to haunt us kids once they are no longer around. I know this is a huge fear of theirs. I live my life each day, waiting for a phone call from my parents or a sibling telling me that something horrible has happened, something that I know I will believe was avoidable if action could have been taken sooner.

I am 23, the youngest in the family and have followed on Jame's financial interest insofar as now having worked in finance for 2.5 years. My sister has been a full time university student since school and has a degree in Health Sciences to show for it, and now studying an honors, while my other brother, Sam sits in a respected position at a large ISP. All three of us have moved away from home to gain distance from the issue and begin to live our own lives. However it's not possible for us to live happily knowing what our parents come home to every night.

Things could be much worse, and the rest of the family has stuck together quite well so far. So we are counting our luck there. But even still, there are often tears and disputes and arguments for different opinions on what should happen next and I have seen the family become more fragile as time goes on.

Difficulty isn't a huge problem, what with the internet being great at answering questions and the fact I pay attention well enough in class to understand concepts. 

I just can't fix this glaring pile of assignments. I'm not sure why, I just can't sit down and get cracking.

1364069108.0,8,self.selfhelp,1aviw4,How identify and move out of bad emotional states.,10,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1aviw4/how_identify_and_move_out_of_bad_emotional_states/,"I've been coaching my friend on how to live better for the past couple of months. I thought others might enjoy this.

First off, I’d like to say great job for coming so far. You’ve made vast improvements in your lifestyle over the past couple of months. Completely cutting off a drug that was such a big part of your life for 2 years is phenomenal. And you quit cigarettes too? Well done. However, I would say your biggest accomplishment is making it to the gym consistently for once in your life. I never thought you could do it. You know what? You’ve become somebody who follows through with things, and that my friend, is amazing. 
Now to maintain these healthy habits, and to grow more, you need to control certain areas of your life. Let’s start with those emotional states. When you are in a bad emotional state it can literally fuck up your perception of life, your motivation to accomplish your goals and your ability to grow. So next time you’re not feeling “natural” or “present”, follow these steps. First of all, breathe, try to relax and get a grasp on reality. When you do this you realize that you’re not in your natural calm state and you need to take action. Secondly, you need something to get your mind off of what you’re feeling for an extended period of time so the bad emotion can fade away. I call these distractions, and they can be anything that will divert you from your negative mental state so a new, more positive one, can take its place. You could exercise, play guitar, listen to music, sing, read a book, watch a funny movie, write, etc. Thirdly, think positively throughout the whole process. Your thoughts are the main source of your emotional state and are responsible for maintaining healthy moods. Whenever you catch yourself thinking negatively, use a distracting technique to stop. Lastly, when you finally climb out of the dark pit of negative emotions, congratulate yourself and make note that you beat the emotional state. When in a negative emotional state, it may seem like your life is fucked and there is no getting out. This is why it’s important to remember that you CAN overcome negative moods.

I have a good job, I finished university and I make quite some money and still I am pretty unhappy. Why?

I lost contact with my friends from university. Most of them got girlfriends and since I didn't have a  girlfriend I was pretty much left out of their circle of friends. And usually I was always influenced by them. I don't know if I really had these kind of problems but I started hearing all sorts of things from them like I was too quiet or I wasn't wild enough. 

This points out to another problem. I haven't been able to find a girl friend. I find I t harder and harder to get attached to someone. I have a pretty unusual job, programming. This really makes me perform poorly socially. I can't really explain why but it involves having a very logical mindset which is good for nothing socially speaking. So for this reason I couldn't really talk with many girls. If it's a scientific discussion then I have no problems. Otherwise I am pretty much clueless. What makes matters worse is the fact that I don't have too much time to work on these things, having a job. It\s not just that, but to me having a job and doing something social is a tiring effort. Maybe I am not used to this, I am still pretty new to my job.

In the end it points out to a core problem: getting emotionally connected to people. When I was younger I could easily talk with people and understand how they feel or in what situation they are in so I could easily respond to that. Now for some reason everything moves to fast that I can't understand anything. This is just one of the reasons. I am harder to impress, you can call me even grumpy. It is said to admit it but being dumped by some girls actually made me feel more alive. Maybe I have become more spoiled?

A lot of my friends go out in clubs but I can't really take any fun in that. Or maybe I go out with the wrong type of people? Or I should do other things.

Heck I hardly remember how this time passed by and all the memories that I have made. I mean I did a lot of things but somehow I always got the impression that I was forced to do them and I never really enjoyed them.

This doesn't affect my relationships with girls but with other people. How  can I get my life back? I am 23 years old and I feel like 40 or 50 inside. I still want to keep my job. Maybe I was having just a hard time getting used to my job.


EDIT: After more considerations, I am starting to doubt my circle of friends from university a bit. I was good at university and pretty smart and people only stayed with me for that soul reason. I never really reached the people with whom I want to hang out because I never really had the courage to reach out to them. I was greeted from the most ""talkative"" people and I imagined that all the people where like that, which isn't the case.

Also, I really didn't fit with my colleagues that first greeted me. And they were a bit of as***** to me in some ways. Not the most mature bunch of people. There were nice to me but they somehow always wanted to look superior to me. Anyway, there are plenty more people out there.

I started talking to a couple of girls, anyway now I don't bother that much about it. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. I guess it's best to be honest and know yourself well. And if it doesn't work just friendzone her or let her be.

It started in like 6th grade, as this stupid competition between me and my friends (at that time) of who could peel more skin on your thumb. Don't ask, I have no idea why we/I did it. Weird and gross, yes, I know. Anyways, i'm 23 now and am still doing it. I've noticed that at different times I do it more than others, like during summer or a vacation or a more upbeat time in my life when I feel more free, i wont do it at all. I have a cycle I do it in, it goes 1.chew for few days--&gt; 2.slow down a bit when it gets too painful--&gt; 3.allow to heal while slowly still picking, repeat). I noticed many times that when the semester comes around i'll start doing it again. I think it is an anxiety and nervous thing, but I've had times when i still do it when I'm not anxious or nervous, but just bored. Often it's been so bad as to where all the sides of my fingertips are raw and/or bleeding (small open wounds). Most often though, it's at least one of my thumbs. My thumbs get the worst of it simply because I can pick with that same hand, so I can do it with only one hand. At this current time it's my right thumb. Here's where it gets odder and deeper: I have this weird thing where when my skin on my fingers is in the healing stage and rough, I always have a strong almost automatic urge to feel and pick at the roughness of the healing skin. It's almost like a Tourettes tick, although i have no history of the disorder. I really wish I could conquer this, I've tried so many times and always fell back to it which has made me pretty skeptical to the idea that I could actually NOT do it, which is in-turn even more discouraging. It's taken a lot to even write this all out, I'm incredibly embarrassed about it, and I always worry that people are gonna notice. When they do, I literally have no idea what to say, because to explain my problem would be super awkward for me and I highly doubt anyone wants to even know this about me. I'm really pouring it all out at this point, as I've recently been doing a lot of introspection lately anyways which has led to this post. I feel like I've tried almost everything, salves that taste bad, bandaids work and make them heal faster but are still just that--bandaids, which don't fully fix the problem. I'm literally doing it every now and then when i type this and when i put my hand back to the mouse. That's how bad it is guys, I often don't even notice i'm doing it. Any advice/help/suggestions would be very appreciated.

TL;DR - I've been chewing my fingers till they bleed since 6th grade. It's horrible and I know it and I really, really want to stop, I don't want to 'be' this anymore, I don't feel it's true to who I see as myself. Help anyone??

Let me start off by saying that I am 18. I just got out of high school, and I'm somewhat scared of college. I'm pretty green in regards to life and its hardships.

Anyway, onto my tale.

About five years ago, near the end of eighth grade, I met a really nice girl. She was sweet, shy, and a general peach to be around. I had a big crush on her, and I called her all the time just to talk to her. We were pretty good friends...well, I thought so, anyway. (In truth, I bugged her a lot.)

Ninth grade rolls along. She gets with this other guy. We are still friends, but she was always busy with her boyfriend. Okay, whatever. I can deal. As the year goes by, she and I just...drift apart; she goes her way, to her friends and to her life, and I go my way, to wherever the hell the winds take me. 

By the time tenth grade was over, we were strangers. She came to dislike me by junior year. I was annoying. A child. She switched classes just to get away from me.

At that point, I thought I would never see her again. With the way our friendship just tapered off, I wasn't exactly happy with that. If it was over, why was there no closure? Where was the movie-esque letter in the mail that describes her feelings? But I had to settle with a bad taste in my mouth and regret in my heart...

...until a chance situation required me to be in a car with her.

She was driving me home. I couldn't drive yet - I was still taking classes for driving. She stared forward, focusing on the road. I did the same. The air was almost chokingly heavy with tension. No one knew what to say. 

So I broke the ice with a story. 

I don't remember what I told her. I was so nervous from trying not to say the wrong thing that I had to force myself to think of nothing but the story. But the basis of it was the fact that I knew I fucked up. I had expected too much from her, and she didn't want anything to do with me.

I kept going on and on until I couldn't go anymore. Then I asked her to park in a parking lot. When she did, I looked at her dead in the face and asked her to tell me what was on her mind.

The next two hours boil down to her basically saying that she used me as an emotional punching bag at the last week of our friendship. She knew I could take it. At the time, I incorrectly interpreted that as 'I still like you as a friend'. We laughed, we cried, we had a time.

Fast forward to summer - two weeks ago, in fact. I text her, and, like usual, she is snarky and rude to me. But something is different. She is really laying it on thick. Probably due to the fact that I was being my old dumb self, and was depressed from a previous encounter with another girl.

""Why do you even text me if you know I will react like this?""

At that point, I realized something.

No matter how much I tried, I simply couldn't change myself to match the type of person this girl could like. As much as I opened my heart to her, as much as I reached out to her, the girl shunned me. This was going nowhere, and the only thing I would get out of trying to be her friend again would be a broken heart and a hatred of women.

""You're right. See you when I see you, I guess.""
""Okie dokie!""

I’m not sure where else to post this but if there is a more appropriate sub-reddit please direct me to it.

I have recently been wondering if I may have some sort of mental problem, I would really appreciate some insight, perhaps from someone who knows or works with the mentally ill. 

 What has led me to this idea:

 I am an extreme perfectionist, here is an example: I am a musician (Singer, Pianist, Harpist.)  
During the summer (during the school year I only practice 3 hours a day), I spend all day listening to music until I stop and practice for two hours singing and then move onto Piano for a two hours and then harp for an hour (I have been told this is too much time to spend on practicing each day and that is why I mention it here.) I tend to obsess over very minute details of my work and It causes me to lose sleep.  

 I’ve had this image in my head of what the perfect young woman is to look and act like, since I was a young child. (I am female. ) 
It has always been: Slender with long fair hair, Can dance and moves gracefully in general, Well-educated, Demure, and a very good classical singer (I added this around the age of  10 years old because I saw the Broadway show “Phantom of The Opera” And got very into actual Opera. )
I worked at it for years and years and now I seem to have obtained these things, they have become true parts of my personality and I am this person who I always wanted to be, I get a lot of compliments on my looks and talents, but it has made me incredibly vain and doesn’t seem very normal, Is it? And I wonder if I am not truly being who I am but I am also not sure who else I could be. 

I do not like the company of other people, much preferring books, and I actually become a bit frightened when strangers come to my home and will not answer the door.  Also, the only reason I obtain friends is so that my parents do not worry about me. However, I often lose them after a time because I only speak and talk to them when I feel it is necessary but the only reason I even go out with friends at all is to reassure my parents that I do have them and also to be able to wear my nice clothing (I come from a semi- wealthy family and collect vintage and vintage replica clothing) in public. This seems very selfish and kind of narcissistic doesn’t it? I do not think this is how most people act but I’m still not sure. 

 I am very concerned with my appearance, often if I am in the process of eating something and begin to feel like I might be eating too much for my waistline I simply put it in my mouth chew and then spit it into a napkin and I do this repeatedly, its quite disgusting and I’d like to stop. Also, until recently(Fall of 2011)  I would very often cut myself  very deeply in my legs and I have huge scars now as evidence of this behavior, on occasion I would burn myself as well.  

Some of my history that might have led to mental problems: 
I lost my virginity at age 12 and continued to behave wantonly and have sex with both genders until I turned 14 ½ (I am 17 now and have been celibate for 2 ½ years.)  

At 11 years old I began drinking and then at the end of my 13th year I started smoking marijuana and taking drugs such as Acid and Psilocybin mushrooms but I stopped all this at 15 and now I will not so much as drink alcohol and I am vehemently opposed to drugs for myself (I don’t much care what others do.) 

From the age of eight until about eleven years old I was bullied very harshly by my next-door neighboor (Also a girl surprisingly) who forced me to do some disgusting things but only on occassion. 

When I was very young (only about 9 or 10) I would get on the internet and watch shock films, things like peoples bodies being opened for autopsy and I also watched and was somewhat intriuged (Though horrified) with the experimental horror film Begotten (E. Elias Merhige) and this was all at such a young age I wonder if it scarred me.

Because of my past experiences and strange personality, I am truly wondering if I may be mentally ill? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, also I apologize for my grammar as I have probably made a few mistakes and I do realize that I have probably put a few extraneous details,  it is late at night for me.

Basically, within the past 2 years of my life (spanning the time I got out of high school and have since been in college) my overall attitude towards learning has changed drastically. I can safely say I am a new person.

I used to not really care much for anything that didn't have to do with my own life (Geography, History, Science, Literature, etc.) and as a result wasn't very absorbent throughout my high school career. But since maturing into the person I am now, I have taken a much greater interest in just about everything. I've been consistently reading more, taking interest and actually receiving what's being taught in school, wondering about the outside world, looking into current affairs, etc. And this has, don't get me wrong, been fantastic. I really do feel like the person I should have been all these years.

My dilemma comes into place as I address my current level of general education. It is very limited. Because of my ignorance in the past, there are so many topics I feel that I'm heavily lacking in. Most of what I feel I am missing can be summed up into what would've been taught throughout Elementary and High School. What my question is, in what way can I go about revisiting, and actually acquiring this past knowledge? I'm talking about staple historic events, geographical locations, etc, etc. Are there general knowledge websites/books/games/etc I should be investing my time in? Are there courses I can take? List of readings? As it stands, if I hear about something I am unfamiliar with, I educate myself on it. And this is great for me. But what I really need is a way to familiarize myself with the key things someone of my education level should know.

**TL;DR The younger me didn't care for knowledge. The newer me does and is looking for a way to revisit the sort of general knowledge that is taught throughout high school, this time with an intent to learn it.**",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_utk7k,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/utk7k/a_newfound_thirst_for_knowledge_is_being_crippled/,

I am writing this seeking advice, or at least so that I can share the things in my mind to another human, but in any case, thank you for taking your time to read and (hopefully) reply to me :]

I am 17 years old. I can say I have a good life. I have friends, I am actually very happy about my life in it's current state. But there is only one problem... I don't know what I want to do later, because after about half a year I need to choose what I want to study, or weather at all to go to uni at all (but I think I'll do, I really don't have any skills with which to survive on my own, although I consider myself an adaptable person who can take care of himself, it will be easier just to go to uni).

My dream is to become something along the lines of a scientist or in a broader sense in academia. I think that’s where I’ll be best off. I think that’s what I should do. But I don’t know how, or rather, I think it’s too late. The field which interests me the most is evolutionary psychology, but I love math as well. I am thinking about becoming a teacher probably,  but I don’t know if I’ll really like it. 

TL;DR: I don’t know what to do with my life after high school graduation. Maybe become a teacher, maybe something involving math… I have no idea what I’ll be best at… 

P.S. I realize this is maybe a very common question, but I worry about this pretty often and I can't really talk about it with friends/parents/etc. They just frustrate me when this is brought up.

Some background info. I grew up in a house that was run as a business. My parents always treated myself and my siblings well, we had nice things. There was always work that needed to be done; a never-ending stream of it. I would help out as required but over the years. I realised though that no matter how much we did there was always some other job or piece of work that was on the roster next. So from that I learned to be out of ear shot of (or otherwise unavailable to) my parents whenever possible or to do things to the letter so I wouldn't spend all my time working. It wouldn't be ALL my time, obviously, but a significantly larger proportion than any one else I knew (who were normal everyday people)

Now I am in university reading a subject I originally loved. The course is 4 years long. I passed 1st year by a hair's breadth (I forgot to mention I am somewhat intelligent so this was a surprise, I expected to pass with flying colours) However, I failed 2nd year, repeated and passed. I failed 3rd year, repeated and passed [**expensive**]. Both of these failures caused significant hardship to my parents perhaps because I am the eldest and they may be afraid I am setting a poor example but after all the fighting and rage they always say that they love me no matter what and they'll do anything for me and I promise to try harder and that I love them too.

Now I am in my final year and, lo and behold, I am sitting on the precipice of failure once again. As in the previous years, in which I failed by procrastinating my work to the point of oblivion, here I sit with just over a month to deadline with zero work done on my final year project. 

I said that I originally loved my subject but from the failures, the monotony of re-attending classes that I had already been to *twice* and getting less and less favourable choices for projects due to poor performance I have come to have a lot of anger/contempt. I say this anger is towards my course but I think it is towards myself. Either way I'm angry and I wish I could get out but I can't. If I were to quit now that would total 6 years of college education wasted that *should* have been 4 years (which my parents paid for) so I feel obliged to try and finish for my parents and their investment, and to give some sort of positive example to my siblings if nothing else.

Now I don't expect reddit to wave a magic wand and save me from whatever fate awaits me (probably an eternity of fire and brimstone - which incidentally I couldn't fault as a just punishment if this was someone else I was talking about). I just want to better understand why I can't seem to change my pattern because whatever the result of my current situation it appears that my scumbag brain and I are stuck together and I am going to need to know how to deal with him if I am to have a life after this.

Also, I feel as though I have been taking advantage of my parents love and forgiveness. 

Which is fucking despicable. I want that to stop but I can't seem to break the cycle - I seem to be aware of my shortcomings and strengths but I never do anything to fix it.

I want to go back to college, but have no idea what to go back for, family and friends say to do what you are interested in, (and are willing to foot the first semester of college), but I really can't find anything that I WANT to do. I'm thinking of going to the local community college for networking (CCNA/CCNP) just because that is what I'm most familiar with, and taking extra classes in biotechnology and criminology just to see if I can get interested in it as it does have some vague appeal to me. Then I worry that if I do I'd have to go back for another 4 year degree, and although I don't have much debt from my first one (3.5k left) taking out loans for it scares me.

Then I get to thinking that I'm spending their money with no clear idea of what I'm spending it on. I feel lost and confused and I just can't make the decision, even though it is most likely the only thing left for me to do to better myself. I'm terrified that I'm missing some incredibly obvious fact that would make this venture pointless, I keep waiting for this epiphany about what I want to do but I know that it will never come.

I guess I need some encouragement that this is a good decision, that I'm doing the right thing, or a point in the right direction if I'm not.

The second voice entertains the most dominant, hard-to-address arguments on the forefront, keeping in mind the lesser ones as possibly substantial insight further down the train of thought.

1312819182.0,10,self.selfhelp,jchv5,How do I move forward?  I know I have a lot of work to do. TL;DR - I suck.,13,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/jchv5/how_do_i_move_forward_i_know_i_have_a_lot_of_work/,"Please bear with me.  I know that I am not a good person.  I really want to turn things around.  I don't want to make excuses &amp; I want to be okay.

I am 23F, and I got out of my first and only serious relationship earlier this year (together for nearly 8 years).  The short version - I have struggled with honesty and with my self-worth for a long time and it finally became too much for my ex, who is generally a wonderful guy.  I have nostalgic and romantic feelings for my ex occasionally.  He was my best friend (saw me through the death of my grandmother, and the suicide of my father) and we are working on having a friendship now.  He has a new girlfriend and I have very happy for him (truly want him to be happy) but from time to time I still hope that a reconciliation might be possible someday down the road.  I know that this is harmful to me (as is our friendship at times), but I can't help it - he still has a big place in my heart and I want him in my life, even just on a friendship level.

For several months this spring, I really dedicated myself to bettering myself.  I stopped drinking, became kind of reclusive and was in therapy.  I was doing a little better, but I was really depressed and lonely and very anxious about the situation between my ex and myself.  I moved home &amp; am no longer in therapy (hoping to find someone new soon) and I feel, or know, that I have fallen off the wagon big time.  I have been having a lot of fun (more drinking, which I know I need to be mindful of), but I feel like I was on a very positive path, and I am now really disappointed in myself and don't know how to move forward.

I met a guy who I knew to be in a relationship.  I was interested in him, but he had a girlfriend and I knew he was off limits.  He was very friendly towards me, initiated contact &amp; conversations in group settings and I developed a crush on him (I believe I was seeking validation, especially since I had just learned of my ex's new relationship).  We were drinking one night and we slept together.  I also really opened up to him about my life.  We have been together several more times over the last month, and after I always feel terrible, but in the moment it makes sense to me.  I know that what I am doing is wrong and that his girlfriend deserves so much better than this.  I am going to put an end to it with him, tell him that it's getting too intense and that I feel it is wrong to continue.  I never, ever, wanted or planned to be ""the other woman"" and I am so disgusted with myself for letting it continue and for not valuing myself, or respecting his situation, enough to see that it's the attention that I am craving and that I don't have to do this to be okay.  AT ALL.

On top of that, I get so in my head, that now I am beating myself up for doing something that will possibly make it harder to have something with my ex in the future.  Which I know is crazy!  I know I am crazy.

I'm just really struggling because I know that actions speak so much louder than intentions or the narratives we tell about ourselves.  I know that I am not this person.  I don't think I am a good person, but I know that I am better than this, that I am worth more than this and that this is not how I want to treat others.  I know that I can be happy and healthy without a guy, any guy - my ex included, to validate me or to show me my worth.  I just miss him a lot.  And I am so disappointed in dragging someone else into my shit by being with this other guy.  And I am so afraid that if I do what I did earlier this year to ""be okay"", that I will lose the friends I have started to make and be alone and depressed again.

I know a new therapist will help immensely, I just have to figure things out.

: ( I don't really know what I am looking for, I guess just if someone else has been through a rough patch, how did you continue to press on when you ""relapsed"" into bad behaviors and choices.  I just feel like I don't deserve anything good anymore.

One half is a highly logical and analytical 25yo female, the other half is a dribbling mess of a person who can't think straight once i'm in a situation that touches upon my insecurities. A lot of the time I can keep it in check and push these feelings away, but sometimes (and most recently the past couple of weeks) it gets to the point where it affects my relationships with the people I love. It's so bad that I purposefully avoid intimate relationships out of the fear that I will turn into this rabid, irrational woman. As lonely as it gets, being single is so much better for me (and for others) than being romantically/physically involved with someone else.
I would try therapy, but at the moment I'm not in a position to pay for or attend sessions. I have a pretty good idea where these issues stem from, but that still doesn't help me fix the problem as hard as I try. In a way, knowing where it all comes from makes it worse.

I'm posting because I might have just fucked up a beautiful friendship that I value immensely due to the fact that I let my irrational concerns take over and I ended up saying things that I had no business saying. I want to fix things, but at this point, I don't know if I can or if I even deserve to be forgiven.

I don't really even understand what's going on with me. I have ADHD (I was diagnosed as an adult, at 30, earlier last year). I've been in a funk for a while now. I might be depressed. 

All I've been doing lately is playing WoW, watching tv, and surfing porn sites. I have a part time job that I do show up for, I haven't screwed that up yet. I'm currently looking for a another job as well, but not really. I have trouble even motivating myself to take a shower everyday. The laundry is piled up, my apartment is a disaster. I just don't care. Well, that's not true, I do care. 

I feel like I'm wrapped up in a straight-jacket of apathy. But, underneath the surface, inside, I'm screaming to get out. I have to actively argue with myself sometimes, when my mind starts to despair. I have to tell myself that 'I can do it', etc. I'm just stuck.

I feel isolated as well. I don't have any best friends. I'm not even sure how that happened. I have a dozen or so friends that I hang out with every week or two, just at a bar or party or whatever. It's all very superficial I guess, we just get drunk and laugh together. You know how everyone has one person they talk to every day, be it a SO or a best friend or whatever. I don't have that. I feel like no one really relates to me. My friends all seem to love having me around, I'm very funny, and I know I'm entertaining to them, and I do think that on some level they genuinely care, but I just feel like an alien to them some times. 

I am fairly certain that my situation has everything to do with my ADHD. I'm on medication, it helps less and less everyday. I have all these books on ADHD that people have recommended to me. I've read the first chapter of each one. Books are like mountains to me, mountains that seem impossible to climb. 

My life is plagued by inconsistency, lack of motivation, lack of focus, lack of purpose, and the fog of an unclear and frustrated mind. The only time I feel normal is when I'm drunk, or immersed in WoW, anything to distract me from all of the goals that I have failed to reach. 

I don't know how to break through it. I'd appreciate any thoughts/suggestions. Thanks.",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_f17m8,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/f17m8/i_havent_done_anything_but_play_wow_and_fap_since/,

Celexa was an excellent part of my recovery that helped fix the pattern of up/down, manic/depression I had created through a dysfunctional childhood and drug filled adulthood.  It helped retrain my brain to live in the shallower regions of emotional extremes so I could start to untangle myself from the mis-learning and lack of learning so common in ALL types of dysfunctional upbringings (alcohol, drugs, workaholics, sex addicts, etc .)

Well, I was lucky and along with Celexa I had a well-versed in new therapies analyst that helped me not only work on the chemicals insides but the mental, physical and sociological issues that all must be addressed in an aggressive recovery.    Celexa held the damn from bursting while I was given the space to explore who I was, what was missing and what was needed to thrive.

Now 8 years later I have come so far I can't even believe it sometimes.  I often get mired in day to day drama and forget how much progress I've made in my personality, my depression, my sadness, my dread, my life, my confidence and especially my relationship to my inner child.

And all of that possible with the help from a tiny little pill that held my serotonin in when I just wanted to dump it out all at once.  

Withdrawal is hard, it's been 3 weeks after tapering off over a month long period and the side effects are daunting - twitches, zaps, neck/back pain, dizziness, vertigo and many others but also a profound reawakening of my sadness and my relationship to my emotions.  I had forgotten how lovely poetry can be and how much I could feel and express but also what it feels like to do  a lot of crying and some downright sobbing.

But my work over the last 8 years is holding and while extremely sad right now I am compensating with my newfound areas of recovery (exercise, diet, socialization, meditation, sleep and fun) and making sure I keep things in proper perspective.  I know that I will be fine.  My little guy inside knows I will be fine and together we are coping and actually enjoying this emotional reawakening.

So…I j ust want to say thank you to my little buddy:  I took you for granted and never understood so fully what you were shielding me from.  Now that you're gone I promise I will keep working hard to fill myself in the right way so that all your good work will not be for naught.

Good bye buddy.

I started the habit in grade school. In the early grades, I enjoyed getting as many ""A""'s as I could, but somewhere around third grade, I realized that playing 10 more hours of video games each week was much more gratifying than getting a few more marks on a report card every few months. This became my philosophy through high school and into a university, where it failed miserably. Instead of shooting for the stars, I set my sites much lower. My system worked well in ITT, though my natural mental ability and acing the tests aided me in actually leaving with more knowledge than most of my classmates. 

I've now worked in the same position for over 3 years, and the pay is only 20% above the amount of money it takes me to survive, rent, and drive to work. Until recently, I saw nothing wrong with that, as my hobbies cost me next to nothing and I enjoy them immensely.
Recently, most of this money's been going into vodka and cigarettes, which I was fine with, but there's an ITT loan I've decided to pay attention to.

I guess what my crisis comes to is, I want to know how people can say the benefits of success outway the extra work for them. Every time I've strived for success, I've found this to not be the case. Am I undervaluing my own success? Do I subconsciously think I'm not worthy of being successful? If so, how can I start changing that. *Why* should I want for my own success? Is that worth asking?

I've suddenly come to the realization that I'm a bad person. It just never occurred to me how mentally mean I've occasionally been. It makes me realize how easily influenced I can become under anything. 

The realization came to me when I was thinking back on how I talked about one girl in a completely despicable manner. About this girl, I've liked her for a while, but lately, I've really began to dislike and become mentally critical of her for her ignorance of the real world including my feelings for her. And to top off these mean and hypocritical thoughts, I come back to the event which gave me my realization. I described things I'd do to her during sex, more like as an object than a person. At the time, I was excited and with friends, talking about girls we thought were attractive and whatnot. But when I got home, she chatted me, and I had a nice conversation with her. But once she logged off, I thought back to what I had said about her and experienced some of the worst feelings of guilt I've ever had. I couldn't believe I had subjected her to such thoughts, me, someone she viewed as a good friend, had done this to her. I could taste the shit in my mouth, I was a bad person. 

The realization got much worse when I started thinking about all the other people I've been a total ass to. In summary, they were all just about the people I had wronged, cheated, or subjected to bad thoughts. But this wasn't what was important, what became immediate to me was that I have to change. I don't want to be this kind of person to others. I want people around me to be happy and have complete trust in my thoughts and feelings towards them as I can never seem to have towards others in fear of what they might think about me. I just don't want to be as much of a shithead in my adult years as I am now. 

I'm not really sure what to ask. But I would really like some advice on how to make myself better about respecting others. I don't want to become angry at others, I want to be forgiving and understanding. And when I have no reason to be angry at them, I want to see them as a human being with emotions, lifestyles, and preferences that I should respect, and even appreciate. I can't believe it took me this long to realize how important other people are, as opposed to how important my own feelings are. So how can I help myself reach this goal of empathy and respect? I know simply becoming more respectful towards other people is the simple answer, but there must be more to becoming a better person. I'm almost tempted to contact the people I've wronged in the past, and tell them I'm sorry, only I don't know how, and don't even know if it's such a good idea...

Any constructive criticism, advice, or similar experiences would really help and be greatly appreciated. I want to improve myself in any way possible.

It's kind of a rollercoaster, at my highs, I hardly mind the dark at all, at my lows, I can hardly get a glass of water in the dark (I wanted to do this today, but I just couldn't, so I decided I should go to Reddit to maybe get some self-help for this).

I'm willing to try some kind of therapy, but a lot of this is just shit that etched into my mind from watching too many horror movies and reading too much creepypasta. Recently I've seen many horror movies, so I'm hitting a new low when it comes to comfort in the dark, but I'm sure that it will pass with time. I'm, however, looking for tips on how I could speed that process up. 

Among the list of common worries that I have:

* A tall, dark, threatening, horrific man watching me laying in my bed.
* An undead monster that's been laying in my bath tub, sitting up as I come out of the shower, looking at me with it's dead face.
* An undead woman being inside the house, always in a place where I wouldn't see her, but her watching me.
* My family members turning into hellish demons (burning eyes) or undead in their sleep.

For reference, I've never been diagnosed with a mental illness, though I have a very vast imagination and a measure of creativity. I engineer and play new sounds for my inner ear, which certainly doesn't help me.

I've never done anything incredibly horrible like take someone's life or beat up a girlfriend. I'm also not suicidal. Despite these lingering dark clouds, my life is relatively good right now. However, in the past I have been very mean-spirited and cruel towards people. Some were people I really cared for. Those memories hurt the most. Other instances involved individuals I really disliked. Some might even say this group deserved my behavior, but I don't see it that way. I never believe it's right to antagonize people, especially if they didn't start anything, and in each case that plagues my mind I was to one who started things. Nothing ever got really violent, but in three cases I did coerce the person into trying to beat the crap out of me before others broke us up or I ran away. I once nearly lost one of my closest friends after playing a humiliating prank on him that nearly cost him a relationship. A lot of this was alcohol related. I'm not sure I'm alcoholic though. Most these things happened years ago when I was 21, new to drinking, and thought getting wasted at parties was fun. Anyway, I'm 27 now, I've learned to control my drinking and behavior much better these days, and I haven't had a bout of really cruel behavior in a few years. Despite all this, I just can't shake these guilty memories, and while they're not leading me to drugs, suicide, or even failure to do my job, they still have their negative impacts on me. I waste valuable time and energy revisiting these bad moments that I don't always do things as quickly and as smoothly as I could. I also know they affect my ability to enter into relationships because my confidence dwindles when these thoughts pop up randomly. Counting my blessings and recognizing my personal growth helps some, but as soon as the memory appears I immediately experience strong self-guilt. This has somewhat become a knee-jerk reaction through much repetition. I don't know, do I really need expensive therapy for this? I'm not against the idea, but if anyone has some useful methods for easing up on yourself for stupid things that are in the past, it would be much appreciated. Thanks.

Alright, when I was 6 or 7 (I don't really remember, everything else around that time is pretty much just a blur) I witnessed the death of one of my friends, who was struck by a car. It was... quite bloody to say the least, and it pretty much broke my innocence, I guess. I grew up being bullied because of the weight I put on due to puberty, and just eating from depression, and had to move because it got so bad. The next view years were pretty much the same thing, I even had a girlfriend who cheated on me after 10 months, told everyone I abused and cheated on her, which resulted in me getting the shit kicked out of me twice (My nose has been permanently damaged.) Even before all that, I was one of the nicest people you could ever meet, hoping that it would help me feel better about the pain I experienced. I lost all but 1 friend, whom (I am aware this sounds extremely stupid because of my age) I loved/still do. I fucked things up with her because I was so lonely and selfish and didn't take her feelings into account, and expected her to be with me even though she had a ""Boyfriend"" who lives half way across the world. Anyway, the loss of friends and death threats I received got to the point where I had to move again, which was almost a year ago. At first things were good, until I met a girl who had an abusive boyfriend, and I guess I admired the fact that she was broken herself. They eventually broke up and we started dating, and things were going good, until I caught her fucking my best friend minutes after I had left his house. Since then, I have barely talked to anyone or even left the house once I graduated unless I needed to. I have even lost all joy in everything. I saw Rush tonight, and had to leave early because I had a panic attack and couldn't be around all the people, and I used to love going to concerts, which was my favorite thing in the world. One of my good friends whom I met at a concert a few years ago (Who I didn't mention because she lives 15 hours away) was diagnosed with Cancer.  We tried online dating numerous times since we met, and she would always find someone else then come back to me when they broke up which lead to a lot of fighting. Recently she told me that she might be in remission, but I got so sick of her coming back to me every time she is single, that I completely stopped caring about her, and the fact that she could die. That was when I realized that my depression is a problem, but I don't know what I can do. I have a loving family which was a way better then average income, and more then enough money set aside for my education, but none of that makes me happy anymore. The only person I have feelings for anymore is the girl I mentioned earlier, but I fucked things up too badly to ever be more then friends with her, and she lives so far now anyway. At this point, I feel the only thing I can do is just end it, not because I'm too depressed to deal with it, but because I would be doing everyone a favor, including myself. When I get stressed, I watch videos of people dying or being killed, which I don't enjoy but it helps me feel, in a strange way, better. Lately I've been talking walks at around 1-2am as an alternative, and slightly hoping something happens and I don't return home.

I wouldn't say I'm a boring person. I'm young, I play and write music on all kinds of instruments, I am learning how to DJ, I skateboard, snowboard, and am artistic. I'm very interested in street culture/fashion, and one day hope to become some sort of designer and potentially open a company.
My problem is that I am not acceptable as a person: I can't talk normally to other people unless they are close friends. I keep telling myself to go out and try hanging out with new people, but every time I do it seems uncomfortable and awkward. I stick with my close friends, and even they say I'm weird.
I act very differently when I am in school and when I'm not: when I am working I am constantly thinking deeply about odd things, like what I will be doing in a few hours, what I have been doing in the past, how my life will go on from this moment and so on. I become sort of an introvert. I am extremely awkward when I'm deep in thought. When I'm not, I'm loud, slightly obnoxious, and I take a lot of things too far. I can't seem to process my thoughts or actions, and I end up making mistakes, and making an ass out of myself.
What is wrong with me? Sometimes I think I was raised odd, or maybe I have a disorder. I have been tested multiple times by doctors, and my parents say I have a very high IQ.
How can I become a better person, and improve the way I act and finally be happy with myself?

TL;DR: I'm weird as balls and think something is wrong with me: need help becoming a better person so I can accept myself.

im a 26 year old guy, and have lived though lets say more than one would expect when talking to me. i am told that i seem like a very calm friendly guy, but look extremely young for my age(19-21).

Witnessed my parents seperation, got cheated on after a 2 year relatioship. Built up my mom after she finds out my dad was cheating on her, at the same time took charge of the house and my two younger siblings. Moved to a different country alone. Took care of my dad getting sick till he was back on his feet. Delt with my moms weird dating habbits(each new guy was... weird). Dad got sick and ended up going to the best hospital he could get which happened to be 20 min drive from my place(yes, i was living in a different country). Took care of him while waiting for a transplant (mostly by myself), then got the bomb dropped on me that he had cancer... giving him maximum a month or two to live. Took care of him mainly alone till everyone else could come and help out. Bury my dad and have everyone stress about the funeral(mom causes problems as well). Found out i was being cheated on for 3 of the 4 years of my current relationship. Mom gets engaged to a sick man(physicaly sick) shortly after we bury my dad. I move to a different country alone because i cant live in that country anymore. Several huge family fights with my mom and her fiance (including when we found out they had gotten engaged without telling us, including the blessing from church). 

These happened in that order and were just the bigger things, also within about 5 and a half years. Now my problem at the moment is that i am getting random anxiety attacks that last for up to 2 and a half hours where i feel on high alert(kind of like the suspense before the end of a horror movie). Had my blood pressure checked while having one of the anxiety attacks and was told that i am lucky im still young because if i were a little older, i could be at risk of heart attacks. (normal i have a below average blood pressure).

So far, i have not found out the trigger of these anxiety attacks and have to conclude that these come randomly, and stay for a random amount of time (10 min to 2 and a half hours).

Now... how exactly can i stop these, or at least lessen the effect or amount of times this happens? im not sure how much longer i can funktion like this",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_1akqkx,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1akqkx/anxiety_attack/,

firstly, i've felt myself become a different person. over the past 2/3 years, i've had events happen that have although probably not big for some have been big events for me. firstly, my best friend and ""love"" decided she didn't like me anymore, leading me to become paranoid and untrusting of anyone. to this day, although less paranoid in a sense, i still refuse to trust anyone. another event which happened is a month after this sudden denial, my dad lost his job, and because of this went through a mental breakdown. i'd be woken up in the night by him screaming out incoherent gibberish, and he couldn't speak without shivering. during this time, i felt truly alone. like i mentioned, my best friend (and also the only one i ever really talked to about anything and truly trusted) had run off. during this time, also piling up were my first serious tests, and i ended up failing my first unit for a few of my subjects, including my favourite subjects that i want to take at A-Level, Sociology and English. before this happened, i felt like i had a lot of friends, and enjoyed going out and just talking to people. after however, i became reclusive, i don't like talking to people for fear that they'll judge me, or even because i'm scared if i get attatched they might ditch me. I started online gaming more (always been a fan of video games) and going from my old i'd play a few games, maybe about  4 hours a week and i'd go out and socialise on weekends, to gaming about 10+ hours a week including weekends. i refused to go out of my house, as i'd prefer to game. i've also felt like over this time i've become desentisized. i feel...empty. i have no opinions on life anymore, i wing every day and i never stick up for myself. i feel like i've completely shut off the ability to feel emotion. writing this post, i feel sad, but at the same time, i feel nothing. confession is doing nothing. 

now, present day. i'm 16 and in my final year. 
i've become slightly better. i'm able to shut off my thoughts during school and the day, and have gotten to the stage where when something troubles me i can ignore it. however, this has gotten me into more trouble, as i constantly lose interest in general nowadays, and even my favourite subject (Sociology) i just sit there, not listening, but not thinking about anything. it feels as if my mind is blank. i constantly procrastinate to an unbelievable standard, and am failing ALL of my subjects, apart from Maths, simply because i either don't do work in class, sit there blank for an hour, and don't do coursework. i don't know why i don't, i don't feel as if it's a choice because i'll try to bring myself to write, but i just can't do it. it feels at times, physically impossible to bring myself to write, and i don't know why, but it ruins my grades and over the course of this year for my essay subjects like english, sociology, and r.e i have consistently even in controlled coursework been unable to write, and have gotten fails in numerous exams because of it. i don't know why, but it feels like it's school is crashing down on me, and the old me, the although more forward, would have been able to deal with these problems in some way, but now my whole body feels like it shuts down when presented with something challenging, and it pains me. i don't understand why i feel this way, but for some reason, it feels like something takes control of me, and immobilizes me, stops me from doing anything but watch my world crash down on me. 

i've never been to a therapist or psychiatrist because my parents feel that i don't need to and that i'm just a normal teenager, but there must be something different about me, right? or am i just a normal teenager going through a phase?

any, literally any help on either why i feel this way, how these and possibly other events have made me like this and why, or.. really just anything that would help me would be appreciated. thankyou for reading this, and it feels good to get off my chest, but i still can't stop this force from taking me over.

I am a grown 12 year old, almost constantly scared of being alone, like extremely scared of being alone. For example, when I am in my piano room practicing piano with my big glass door open the kitchen is across the room from the dining room, I get scared when somebody leaves the room and goes to the kitchen, even though I can hear them very well. Also even when someone is behind me while I am practicing piano I look behind me, trying to see something, which I don't know what. Numerous times over the past 3 years of me practicing piano I have started to lose my focus and play terribly with my fear of something (I don't know what I'm constantly scared of). Once I start playing without my focus my mom asks to focus and I can't! I am struck with a sense of extreme fear, and usually yell and my mom yells back, causing a great misunderstanding between her and me over the past few years. 
Examples of being scared of everything and being afraid of being alone:

Staring around my room for hours before I fall asleep, not wanting to go outside to take out the trash even in the light, not wanting to go downstairs, and the piano incidents I explained earlier.

Other times it's neutral or even pleasant. I generally have much better results when it's more pleasant. It seems there's no relationship between pain and accomplishment, or even an inverse relationship. Here are some examples:

Eating less can be pleasant when I'm on vacation. I get a clear signal when I've eaten enough and I don't get any craving to eat more for pleasure. I can even find that eating more is unpleasant. There's no diet, no fighting and it basically happens all by itself.

Physical exertion can also be pleasant or unpleasant. Sometimes I don't want to do any exertion (eg. exercise or cleaning), while at other times I don't even mind exertion that involves some pain and leaves me a bit sore afterwards.

Socializing can also be unpleasant or pleasant based on my mental state. When I have to fight through unpleasantness to socialize, there's much less successful in terms of having meaningful interaction that leads anywhere. (I'm not simply talking about anxiety here.) 

Internal work in my own mind such as countering negative thoughts and ideas can also be unpleasant or pleasant. Sometimes it's futile torture while at other times it's successful and it comes with a sense of accomplishment.

The pain and suffering we all inevitably experience in our internal worlds comes almost solely from how we define ourselves in answering the question ""what is my identity"".  In a grossly materialistic position, one can identify with all forms of matter like cars, money and other external objects, which society largely looks down upon this form of identifying, correctly labeling it materialistic. But in less overt ways we also identify with relationships and roles of behavior, and in very subtle ways we identify with feelings, emotions and neurosis. Often throwing in ""Oh that's just me"" in response to our inability to shake them.  But we are none of those things, they are all simply *things*. They are a part of our experience and occupy our attention but in actual fact we are the *attention* not the experience, we are the *witness* to the experience of these things. The experience is simply so overwhelming that without paying careful attention *to our attention* we get caught up and entangled in the experience, similar to when we're dreaming and thinking the dream is real.

Once we start to pay attention to the subtle things in life which are holding us back, the impetus for us to improve ourselves is huge. But what we often mistakenly assume is that those drawbacks in us need to be eradicated, removed by positioning ourselves at odds to them and eliminating them, in true western warlike fashion. ""This is wrong, lets correct it and it will be right."" 

The biggest lesson I've learned is that these parts of our experience that get highlighted by introspection are not blocks but in fact the doorways to our healing. Ironically, it is by creating resistance to them we block our own pathway to that end. Instead of striving gallantly to destroy them, if we could widen ourselves enough, creating space for these experiences to exist as they are and sit with them, learning to become comfortable with the uncertainty they bring, they can become powerful tools for us to discover who we are. Due to our identification with them, they become are our 'edges', the fuzzy ground where we're not comfortable or confident, because where we would like to see solid wall defining the boundary of our being, we perceive a hazy gap and it's confronting, scary, and likely to raise even more feelings and emotions in the process of exploring them.

This act of 'sitting with' things is actually a kind of meditation, where we simply observe reactionary feelings and behaviors without seeking to improve, criticise, label, remove, etc. After enough time, we realise that we are not these things that bother us, they are simply an experience that we are going through, who we are is actually in the position of the witness of these things, and the more we sit and observe the clearer that fact will become.  With enough strength and devotion to this practice, there is an internal transition that slowly occurs, as we observe, a realisation, conscious or not, begins to land: *If i can observe this thing, then it is not me.*

So there is no escaping to the hills on offer here by withdrawing our attachment to things, although that is definitely the process some schools of thought take to this conundrum. It is a fact that our position in this world is definitely in this world. So there is no point in trying to escape the experiences themselves by running off to be a monk in the hills. Instead we embrace the lot, but in the process raising our consciousness to what exactly is going on. 

So you've got problems, neurosis, issues, things you want to deal with. Well the absolute first step is to create internal space. A distinction between the world we exist in, and our internal position as the experiencer of the world we exist in.  This is challenging because so much of our worldly experience *feels* internal, but is actually not. When I say internal I am referring to the deep internal witness, *no thing*.. there is no way for language to put a finger on what I'm referring to here. It is in our nature to want to be able to point definitively to things, but in this realm it cannot happen, we can only hint at it. This is why the practice of meditation is so necessary, it develops an appreciation and an inner *knowing* for that which cannot be discussed. 

As the shift of identity occurs, the issues we have with our neurosis and problems become lighter, we perceive them as being bubbles on the surface but remain solid and unperturbed in grounded knowledge of who we really are in the position of the witness. The weight is taken out of them because we are no longer running from or fighting against anything. This lightness of being is the ideal place. We can be comfortable with the amorphous nature of our experience because nothing can touch or affect our true core essence. But the real beauty of this, is that it is our resistance to things which give them their form, once we remove our resistance they cease to have any power over us, so they can simply be.

I am not asking for advice on how to dream less, but how to get realistic and cope with reality. 

I tend to think that I'm not going to be happy or successful, and that I 'll waste my potential if I go for the same careers/degrees that most people get. I think that I have to become famous to achieve anything, which obviously is a stupid and unrealistic thought. 

Some background info: I'm a 20 year old male who hasn't figured out what he's going to do with his life.

1348797903.0,6,self.selfhelp,10lj73,I'm 28. Girl. And I need help.,9,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/10lj73/im_28_girl_and_i_need_help/,"Hello, Reddit. Here is my story. 

I just turned 28 a few weeks ago and I feel like my life is falling apart. Almost everyday, when I get up and the program reloads, I think to myself today will be different. It almost never is.

I have sought help for depression and anxiety and everything else in the world. I have all the tools but I am not using them. I am hitting rock bottom. 

I have a job, I am in school, but I don't have the life I want. I see what I want, I don't know how to get it. 

To be specific, I have fought depression and anxiety with counseling, multiple drugs (lexipro, paxil etc.) After finding out that my moods are triggered by a hormone inbalance, I sought help for that. I have food plans and supplements. I have 8 or so years of tireless fighting under my belt to curtail personallity swings, a poor childhood and a real, chemical issue. 

Instead of grabbing the day by the balls, I slept, ate pizza and watched Workaholics. This is not the life I want. 

I need to break up with my boyfriend and it is causing me more anxiety than I can handle. I have shut down for weeks now. I don't want to hurt him, he is a good guy, he is just not the one for me. But the harder he tries to make me happy, the worse I feel because he's not doing a good job. He didn't celebrate my birthday, and has gotten anti-social and weird every time we go out and try to do something. Then that same evening he'll tell me oh man I acted stupid - let me make it it up to you.

I am so smart and could be so pretty if I lost some weight, but at this point the amount of mountains I have to climb just to break even seem like too much. 

I am running from everything all of my problems. Im am choking up just writing this because no one knows how I feel. I don't want to burden friends and family with this because I'll just let them down when two weeks from now, I haven't done a thing. I am scared of myself. 

My hormones are so wild that I never know how I'll feel when I wake up the next day. I was on birth= control to try and regulate them, but it did ultimately not help.

I am so stuck. I want to give up. Is there any one that can relate? What did you do?

I have no degree, I still rely on my parents for further financial support, and I don't have very good friends.

What I want out of life - Vivaciousness, love, warmth. I am talented and want to make an album, tour. I want love that bring me up because that is the kind of love I give. I am funny and I want laughter. But I am clinging on to what I have just so it isn't all gone, so I am not all alone and so I don't feel like no one cares.

Is there anything? What can I do? What will change this? Anything will help. Thanks

I've always been a ""bigger"" girl , averaging around 230lbs (but my heaviest being 250). I've always known in the back of my mind that I could stand to lose some weight and all that it would take was to exercise some and eat a little better. But it was never really a HUGE concern for me. 
After a treacherous 4 yrs of being with someone who made me feel like a worthless human being, I woke up one day and just wanted to break free. I wanted better for MYSELF. So, I ended the relationship and decided that I wanted to focus on myself and become a better person. 
I didn't realize it in the beginning, but I gradually lost my appetite for food and I guess I was shedding pounds like crazy and it really didn't register until people in my everyday life would be shocked with the way I looked. I was getting compliments left and right and people asking me how I did it. I honestly did not have a probable reason. I just wasn't hungry and it wasn't like I was exercising any more than I did before. I think my self shock was the day I decided to get on the scale and seeing me teeter in the very low 200s(probably around 205). 
Around the end of January, I was semi interested in dating so I decided to take the online dating route and just be open minded about it all. I definetely was NOT looking for a relationship, but I wanted to meet someone new and spend time with.I actually was very lucky to find a twin like me (who I am still dating 2 and a half years later).
Around that same time I decided to up the game by joining the gym. I felt like I was on top of the world. I was on the right path to becoming the healthiest I've ever been in my entire life and spending time with someone who made me feel worthy.
After seeing that I could reach 200, I thought ""well, I could shoot for 180 maybe even more"" because I could never see myself as a ""skinny"" girl (I'm just not built that way). So, I started to count my calories. I put myself on a 1200 calorie diet and when that seemed like ""too much"" 1000 sounded even better. I was going to the gym for up to 3 hours a day. I wasn't sleeping very well, very constipated (for up to a week) and having horrible nightmares. I started to feel on edge and as others would say ""moody"". I would hear friends/coworkers joking that I eat like ""a bird"" and it would set me off. I hated being watched. I felt like I was bettering my health. It got to the point where I knew I had to see a doctor because I was having horrible stomach pains. What I thought would be a quick urgent care trip ended me up in the hospital. My HR was dangerously low (39BPM). After my 24 hr stay (I was 170 around then) in the hospital they came to the conclusion that since I was a very active person I had a form of Bradycardia.
After that stay in the hospital I was afraid of damaging my heart by overly exercising so I decided to kick back on my gym sessions. 
I started to feel ""fat"" and felt disgusted with myself and that I was gaining weight if I skipped out on a workout session. Because of fear of getting back to the way I was before, I started to purge my food. I did it from time to time. But that soon became EVERY meal then to ANYTHING I put into my mouth. I felt sickened with having ANYTHING in my stomach. I started to get acne. My skin was very dry and stilll having trouble sleeping and same nightmares. I felt horrible about myself and still a fat slob. 
I ended up becoming friends with someone who struggles with bulimia as well and I think the trigger that made me want to care about myself more was a conversation we had one night. After I had said ""I do want to get better. My biggest fear is being found over a toilet of vomit because my heart couldn't take it anymore"" and her response was ""Not me. I don't care. If that's the way I die, then that's the way it is"". I just felt I valued my life enough that I want all this to end. To stop worrying about food and weight. So gradually, I told people closest to me so that I would have some support. Also, I felt if I told them my secret I wouldn't be tempted to do it because I felt embarassed or that they would know that I had purged my food. 
There was a while where I hadn't done it for up to a month or so (and that was really good for me). I decided to get back into my gym routine because not only did it make me healthier it was also my destressing activity. 
My boyfriend is on a ketogen diet. He's been very successful and has lost 31 lbs in about a month in a half. I'm happy for him for the most part, but part of me feels disappointed in myself. I've gained a considerable amount of weight back in the past year (I'm 202 now) and feel like all my hard work has gone down the drain. I've been back on my gym routine for a month now (5 to 6 days a week/2 hr sessions) and am seeing little to no results. I'm also back to restricting my calories (under 1000) and am having the urge to purge my food more strongly than i did before. I find myself purging my food not only because of wanting to keep my weight down, but when I feel upset or angry about anything. I feel like I can't control myself. My self esteem is at an all time low. I have the fear my now thinner boyfriend is going to wake up and see he's stuck with a disgusting slob. I can't lose weight fast enough. I don't know what to do. I don't feel like my problem is serious enough to see a professional doctor because when they look at me they see a fat, disgusting, slob...""how could she have an eating disorder?""
So, I'm seeking advice from anyone struggling with or knows someone whos is struggling or has had an ED...what self help tips do you have? I really DO want to get better.I don't want this to take a toll on my relationship. I don't want to worry about food and weight. I want to feel happy with my life and myself.

I was just wondering if anyone had techniques for battling very low self esteem? I'm 18 and I've been dealing with the same situation every day for years now : Everytime I socialize with even my best friends, I will later go back over and analyze everything I've done until I feel stupid, embarrassed, and even worthless. It often keeps me up at night (like right now) and prevents me from enjoying myself -- I sometimes even take someone being kind to me as them being nice out of pity or something. Its also really strange because I generally do really well when I talk to people and I hang out with friends all the time, but I just feel stupid. Not trying to sound cocky, but people have even told me I'm the most-liked person in my school and yet I can never bring myself to believe them. At times I hit points that I would consider severely depressed, but no one would ever know based on my demeanor. Anything I can do to deal with this?

So heres the range my issues. I am a midtwenties male (living with my parents) that feels stuck living at home. I have a job that pays well but is currently infrequent. I'm afraid of getting a another job and then have work pick up for my original job that I love and this not be able to work at it. This is especially difficult too because I live at home with my parents and would love to leave but rent is super expensive where I live. I would like to go back to school and get a degree and get a job in something else I love but I usually get super depressed and either drop out, fail, or end up getting mediocre grades. It almost makes a pattern: I dropped out of high school. got a GED, took forever to get an AA, transfered and after one could semester and am now on academic probation. I was born with a facial deformity and it was been a consistent cause of social anxiety and depression (although some people say it is not noticeable I feel they are just being polite). This has hampered relationships with family, friends, and significant others. I have seen psychiatrists and therapists whom I feel either try to push drugs on me or just dont seem to relate well enough with me.

After having surgeries to fix my facial deformity I developed a drug problems that I still havent been able to shake. NA just doesnt work for me. I am not a fan of group therapy nor god things. 

So my series of questions are: How do you wake up in the morning? Often times I wake up at a reasonable hour and just feel so shitty I go back to sleep. How were you able to finish projects and things that you've started? I mean, I really want to get a degree but it feels completely out reach.

My boss has a a link to their forum on his site. It's well worth a look. I see plenty of people on here talking about ""self"" and feelings of detachment. This is a positive spin on that.

I don't feel like I've been happy or exited in something since the first months with my girlfriend.

Here's some background:

I'm graduating my bachelors with a psychology degree. I can't really get a decent job until after my masters. However, I don't know which field to choose. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life. I love psychology and understanding the mind. But, I don't see myself working in the field. I love animals. And would love to be able to work in something related to them. But wouldn't know where to start. I'm lucky to have a father that is willing to pay for my masters program but for him to do that I need to make a decision now. So I made the decision of studying behavior analysis. Not a career path that I'm truly fascinated by. I have an internship in the field, working with autistic children and it's not too bad. But I'm not motivated to do anything, ever.  

I am also gay and haven't come out to my parents. This is eating me inside. However, I can't risk telling them and them cutting me off financially. 

I've been with my girlfriend a year and a bit now and she's great and has put up with all my shit. I don't want to lose her because of me being in a weird moment in my life. We fit too well together.

My self-esteem is gone because I feel useless and don't know what to do with myself. Because of this, I've gotten extremely socially awkward and constantly try to avoid being in social situations. The only true friend's I have live far from me. I'm bored with my life but can't seem to find the energy to change it. I have tried forcing myself into the world but it hasn't changed the fact that i'm unhappy. 

Does anyone know of something that I can do in order to make myself enjoy life again?

EDIT: I also forgot to add that I feel guilty quite often. I feel guilty for being gay and not letting my parents know while I still depend on them financially. I feel guilty for not knowing what to do with life. I feel guilty for being socially awkward, for being apathetic in life, and for not being the person I want to be. It all weighs me down a lot but I dont know how to change those thoughts.",,False,,t5_2qho7,1337777633.0,,,True,t3_u0wtn,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/u0wtn/any_help_with_apathy/,

(xpost from /r/pickup)",13,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/ricub/the_most_intense_and_introspective_night_of_my/,"*This text is copied from a post on /r/pickup, about one of my most unique experiences with the amazing individual who runs it.*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**So I was really busy last week, but have been adding to some unfinished thoughts here and there. Now that I have time, I'd like to share them with you all.**

Last week, I read Dante's introspection post, and felt some emotion as I read it. For some reason, even though I couldn't really relate with his problems. I felt like I knew how he felt. I guess, just the way he wrote was so real, and truthful. Maybe it's because I felt that there is no way someone NOT in a deep emotional state could write like that. It just really hit me. Anyways, sometime last week, I had an unrecorded Real Talk with Moneypower. Unrecorded because, even though I knew I kind of wanted to talk to him about my introspection; I wasn't sure if the conversation would lead there. Not to mention, it was pretty fucking late.

I had joined him on Skype to talk about some girls in my life. I did, and then told him how I felt about Dante's post. Although it's pretty hard to remember the exact conversation (about an hour long), I basically told him that I felt like there was something wrong with me; I knew something could be better. That although I felt pretty comfortable with myself, there was a still a piece of me that wasn't. Even now, I can't thank him enough, but he finally unlocked that for me. It was honestly, the most emotional thing I had felt in a long fucking time.

That night I wrote this after the RT:

***I feel so clear headed right now. Like a huge burden has been lifted off me. As usual on /r/pickup, I've felt like I've learned something new, like I have been, almost every day since I've found and joined the subreddit. I was always very introverted, and never said much. Tonight I realized that I speak a million miles per hour, and say everything that comes to mind, not letting other people speak until my thoughts are done. Which to many, may seem overwhelming, and may be why not everyone I interact with in the field likes me. That is too much for some people, I may be too intense for them. Money realized this, and let me pour my heart out; letting me speak nonstop. He knew I just needed to let it out. After this, I realized no one had ever allowed me to do this. It stirred up a deep emotional state within me.***

***Just looked in the mirror, after washing my face like he suggested, with warm water. It was totally different. I saw a total new person, the same, but in a different way. Like, the child me, but in the adult form. As I wrote that last sentence, I felt so much emotion rush over me, and almost burst into tears. My eyes are watery. As if that is what I've been trying to bring out for the longest. Child me, one's true self, not held back my societies pressures, or peoples opinions. Just me, the real me. I feel comfortable with myself, and who I am. Not THINK I feel comfortable, but KNOW I feel comfortable. Now my watery eyes let out a tear. This continues to build, and I find it fascinating. Totally mindfucking amazing. While looking in the mirror, I found a new love for myself. I saw a postive energy about me, and felt like, next time I go out, not just to game, but just in general, that people will notice that. In the mirror, I saw a good looking, confident, comfortable individual. Baby me, all grown up, becoming a man (deep emotions stirring up again). I've come so far in these past few weeks since the start up of this reddit. From masking myself with things I have learned about seduction from RSD, and seddit, to just learning to love myself. On seddit, it's like, everything I learned there, as much sense as it made to me when I heard, saw and read it; is totally useless now. Text game, conversation, game in general; now seen in a total new light. I've learned over these past couple of weeks, more than I've learned since studying seduction from the end of last year.***

I love how far I've come since I've found /r/pickup, met Moneypower, and the core homeys on IRC. In conclusion, I just want to say thanks Money, for helping me unlock a part of myself that I had lost for so long.

Yesterday, as I went to a high school reunion, I realised that there is nothing in my life worth talking about. As I was in a circle of people who live lives completely different to mine, I saw that I know nothing about real life - that I live in my little comfortable bubble I created, behind a veil covering the emptiness of my days from my own eyes.

I have been feeling unhappy for quite some time now, but everyday distractions kept me in a numb comfortable state. But now it hit me. I feel like I am dead and unsure whether I already died, or never even lived.

I want to change all this. I want to start living a full life. I want to start living. So I seek your advice. How does one start to change his life? Where to begin?

I procrastinate a lot. But when I work on something I feel a need to see it through in one shot and wont take a break, often working through the night. So big projects are difficult to start because I have a hard time doing them in pieces.

I'll also get super interested in one subject, pushing away other things I was interested in before, often burning myself out or getting disinterested in the new subject.

Both seem to stem from an 'all or nothing' or 'go big or go home' unconscious mindset (although I do say those phrases a lot so maybe conscious too). Granted sometimes these 'flaws' are a good thing wherein I can work diligently on a project and get it done and also learn a lot about new subjects that catch my attention. However, they also hinder me from starting large projects and can turn me away from interests I've loved and invested in.

So how can I improve now that I realize these things?",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_lqqmr,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/lqqmr/recently_had_insights_about_my_personal_flaws/,

My problem is that I view my self-worth as a comparison of everyone else around me. Basically, **I constantly compare myself to everyone around me and make myself feel like shit**. It's not even about attractiveness (though I do compare my body shape with other people), but intelligence, skills, and experience.

My major is comp sci and I'm struggling to get by. I study really really hard and do understand the material, but when it comes to 50-minute or 15-minute test-taking, I end up getting mediocre grades or failing. And upon learning my classmates scores (one is my boyfriend who is an amazing programmer and the other people are my friends), I compare my bad grades with their As and just fall into a pit of depression and my thought process ultimately leads to ""Why are you so useless?"" ""You should just end it now?"" I work as hard as I can for this class, but I just can't do tests and they decide my grade.

Another thing that I do is compare my experiences to other people. Oh you're an intern at so-and-so? Oh, you made 3 websites already? Wow, you've done more than me. I suck at life, don't I? I am constantly measuring where I am in life by comparing myself to other people, which leads to my fear of being left behind. I also get depressed because of this. I want to do so many things like clubs and a job, but realistically, I can't. I even compare myself to my younger sibling who is a freshman in my school. She's meeting so many more people, being more active, and is more responsible and put together than I am. My parents constantly ask me why I'm not as involved as her, which I answer that I have school to worry about, but they still think I need to be more active, and I feel more like shit.

This semester has gotten very difficult for me to emotionally handle to the point that I'm crying like every week because ""I'm not good enough"". My boyfriend is trying his hardest to help me by going over all of the course material with me to make sure I understand it, but I still end up screwing up while everyone else that he helps gets As.

I seem to have this subconcious definition that doing things The Right Way isn't for me, and whenever I'm around someone like that, I feel resentful.

i.e. my last boss was a brilliant entrepreneur -- but every time I was around him, and he wanted to share something with me, I'd internally roll my eyes and feel the urge to go back to playing WoW.  At some level I was defining ""doing things the right way"" as something that I'm *not*.  

I just don't know how to change this.  I have a solid job right now, but I feel constantly in danger of losing it because the thought of *working hard all day* -- even though I know perfectly well I'm intellectually capable of it -- but the thought of *being a good, loyal employee* is antithetical to who I am.  I've defined myself into a child-like, dependant state.

I remember watching people early in my career take on more responsibility, work overtime, etc -- thinking internally ""that's not me, I'm not like that"".  Now, they have very stable jobs and families, I'm getting divorced.  

How do I attack those definitions?  At some level, I don't see myself as a Good, Stable, Person -- I see myself as a cynical man-child, because I keep making decisions that bear that out.  I just don't like where I am, but the thought of changing those definitions -- and I guess, admitting I was wrong?  Or admitting I've changed?  I don't know, I can't find a way to get a handle on those thoughts.

*There's no reason* I shouldn't be more successful than I am.  I'm smart, I can hold my own in public speaking, if I lost a bit of weight I'd look pretty good (i.e. I'm not obese and covered in acne), I've just defined myself into a role in life that I don't really prefer.

1313832539.0,6,self.selfhelp,joqmx,Do confident people get irritated by the inscure or is there a deeper problem here?,8,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/joqmx/do_confident_people_get_irritated_by_the_inscure/,"Hiya reddit. I'm a 28yo male, who used to have a huge lack of self-esteem but realized this and am dealing with it. Lately, it's become apparent to me that many of the people I've closely associated with are highly insecure or lacking in self esteem as well.

As a reality check, I'd say I am still sorting out myself ever since I hit ground zero but I notice that as I come to terms with myself, I am increasingly aware of the insecurity among my peers when it acts out against me and to be blunt, it is becoming nauseating.

I am also aware that whenever someone questions my ability or nature I am no longer phased like before, and if I share their doubts, I'm quick to assess this and even bring it up into the open. But what I don't understand is that there is a part of me that is extremely disgusted by their questioning when I know it comes from their own insecurities.

I suspect I may still have lingering doubts with my own ability but it was not always like this. There is an event I can strongly recall at the moment that happened fairly recently, before I started to rebuild myself and my confidence with it. During this time, I was still highly insecure with myself, and it happened that I was confronted by my peers in a very direct manner on one of my nuances. ie. Why I never let friends over to my place.

Now I realize this sounds like a simple question but I was torn apart during that conversation. It went from I was hiding something to not trusting them as 'friends' to pointing out flaws in my personality. One of the participants went to the extent of citing I was a narcicist and a victim of the Dunning-Kruger effect. The last bit impacted me most because prior to seeing the article, I have always at least been sure of my own abilities and never placed myself on a pedestal. After that, I've managed to convince myself that I am not but I find myself still constantly watching myself to see if I am overstepping or making a mistake of overestimating myself.

Hence the nature of this post. I'm wondering if my irritation is towards insecure people are normal or could it actually be coming from some deep seated issues (such as what i listed) that needs to be resolved. Any ideas how I can deal with this?

TLDR; Is it normal for someone who is sure of himself to be irritated whenever others behave insecurely?

Update and Edit:

Hi guys, and thanks for the comments. Frankly, I'm not sure about this still. Is it because I truly see 'myself' or certain qualities like that in the behavior of the people I mention about or that I am seeing an echo of behaviors I used to have. For the record, I don't observe it in their normal behavior, or even when I do, it doesn't bother me. The times these behaviors bother me is when they are directed at me in one way or another. 

Examples are such as when a colleague comes and passive aggressively tells me about a story draft I'd written that it's not up to the standards of some famous film, then goes on to say how he likes those better and was expecting something like that. There are some high stakes in the project we're working on so I could understand if he was nervous or insecure, but when I asked and he kept denying it, this got me worked up and my line of questioning became more aggressive in nature.

Another example is an ex-classmate who developed a habit of calling me degrading names which I felt was somewhat out of place given there was some distance in our relationship with one another. This only happened whenever she was in the presence of a particular friend. In her actions, I sort of had this feeling she was trying to seem in control and likewise exercise some kind of domination over guys in particular. In her case, it is the idea that she's doing this out of some insecurity or some weakness in esteem that she isn't aware of that gets to me. On the surface, I let these comments slide, but deep down they do trouble me as I do not know where exactly this passive aggressive behavior is extending from.

Again I need to emphasize that most times, I'm completely unaffected by this behavior except when its directed by me. Sorry for the late response but I do hope I can gain more insight into this.

I consider myself a great person, funny, intelligent, etc. But when people disagree with me or when a lot of people have opinions that differ than me, I lose lots of self-confidence, and I also become consumed by the idea of trying to figure out the details of disagreements (to a point that I become almost slightly depressed). What makes this worse is the career choice I want to make. I have a high GPA and LSAT score, and will be going to law school.

Hobbies? Yeah, I've got hobbies. I write daily, I read prolifically, I paint, I play music and - after four years of abstinence - I've started playing video games again too. 

I've got friends as well. I've got a best friend who is the most loyal guy in the world and is the ying to my yang (of the no homo persuasion). On top of him, I've got a whole group of close friends. Multiple, actually. I've got a group of crazy bitches (of the platonic persuasion) and I've got a few groups of bros. People love me. 

On top of that, I love me. I think I'm the fucking shit. 

So why am I bothered at my lack of a significant other? Why can't I be satisfied with myself? I don't get what I'm doing wrong and why I can't just be content with what I have -  I've got everything a person needs (except a cat). 

I don't get what I'm not doing. I don't get why I can't be content with being single. I don't want to have this compulsion to look for a significant other. I don't want to have an attractive girl talk to me and have me envision our entire future together and then have a shitty night when I find out that she has a boyfriend. I want to not care. I don't want to get upset when the girl doesn't choose me. 

I know that the ""right girl"" will come along eventually. Why can't I just let it happen rather than trying to force things to happen, creating fantasies that just aren't there?

I have never been able to clearly say that I'm part of any group right from my school time and I can't think of any honest, credible reasons for that because it's just been the I way I am.

Even my close guy friends who I have, I communicate with them probably not more than 2-3 times a month, mostly because they live in different cities, and we tend to be busy(but I know that's really just an excuse from my part.. read on). Most of these friendships have died down due to this, there is no intensity to speak of.

Furthermore, I am still learning how friendships and group formations work, so this post, despite how naive it might seem, is actually a reflection of my poor awareness of how it works.

Recently, I got back to college again today to do my MBA, and well a couple of months into the course, I am ""probably"" part of a group. I say this with hesitance,  My friends like having me around and do call me to a good share of the times we hang out. However, I know that the inter-communication that happens between them is far greater than me with them.

Some of my reasons why this bothers me is:

* I feel I'm treated as a sort of general lurker who they like being with

* I never get to hear the very personal stories, of which even I admit I haven't shared all of mine.

* I rarely sms them, and they rarely sms me, and I have only been recently aware after going back to college about how good friends tend to use this channel a lot. 

* Least to say, I'm extremely bothered about this, and it even affects my mood when I hang out with them.

* I'm also extremely uncomfortable with women and have never been in a relationship and don't have very close girl friends who I communicate often with.

So the help I'm looking for is some sort of template to figure out how to be part of a group , same-sex or mixed-sex, and I also want to get a feel of how often friends sms each other and all, what do they sms about,  how often should you hang out with these friends in a day, and if you're sincerely busy, do you still msg or something .. I hope someone has a clue what I'm trying to get at..

If it also helps, I'm typically been termed as childish or immature or cartoonish due to the kind of random/trivia stuff that I talk about. Also I tend to be more sarcastic and less slapstick in my jokes.
Sorry this is so long-winded and naive, and thanks for reading this, and please help!

I was steeped in the mind of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and his crimson tales captivated me to such a point of inaction. Tuesday, however, was the red wine to Monday's white. 'Twas bold, and full of flavor; rich in progress was my Tuesday. The morning was spent at the books, and the afternoon I toiled for money. The evening was ushered in with physical activity, and I entered into the night full of self satisfation and a feeling of accomplishment.
 

then the night fell on me in force. In the small corners of my room, with lights lit and curtains draw, one does not notice the sun's departure, and the passing of time can be hard to mark. This is especially the case when one has blundered into the waiting arms of a new entertainment. They absorbed my entire evening, those ""Heroes"", and when my eye's dared alight upon the clock above my head, they gazed at the accusatory hands with a cold disinterest. it wasn't until 8am that I was released, and then only by the knowledge that I could not afford any more time, lest I run late to work.
 


And so, I write now to you, having not seen the side of my pillow for far too long, to tell you of how my day was. Progress was made, I suppose, but not the sort I'm striving for. During the course of the dreary existence I lead, I noticed I'd acquired a new sense of clarity. I don't know how to describe it, as the words were stolen from my lips as I moved to speak them, but suffice it to say, I feel good.

I'm writing this because out of all of the self help books I've read(which is dozens) I've never found a good answer as to how to stop sabotaging myself. By this I mean doing things I know I shouldn't, but for some reason keep doing them anyway. An example of this is drinking(a bit) and then driving myself home. I'm not completely irresponsible about it, but last night I got stopped and had to do all the tests. I blew into the breathalizer and I passed just fine, but I felt shaken by it nonetheless.  I've got a lot of confidence issues and I'm not sure how that ties into it all, but I have a feeling it does.

In an effort to quiet my mind and be more self-aware I've been meditating daily for a couple months and that seems to help a bit. I just was curious if anyone else had any ideas as to how I can stop sabotaging myself.

my question is hard to convey in a diplomatic way, so please excuse my direct approach.

I feel that a large cause of my lack of motivation/discipline is caused by the fact that I am ""good enough"" or maybe ""too good"".  A part of me wants to be better, the part that slows me down is happy with the current outcomes and makes me relax and procrastinate.

To understand this issue, I need to give a few examples.

At school I noticed that I can do homework in one subject while (if!) my teacher checks for done homework at every single desk (due to the desk layout). In other subjects I exploited the fact that very good grades in previous years made it way too easy to convince the teacher that I should continue to get good grades without actually participating that much. In general I noticed that some students really work hard to get the best grade, while I can easily get a grade only slightly worse (i.e., 1- instead of 1+).

At university I had to learn for exams, but I really had no problems achieving good grades. Because of this I gambled a bit and in some lectures that really did not interest me I barely passed (on the upside: without much effort). For my thesis, instead of living for it like a lot of my friends did, I just worked hard on the parts that were fun and pushed myself to somehow do the remaining work.

In my work life I also never really failed at something, so instead of doing work ahead of time and with excellent results, I just do it when I feel like it and get away with it - sometimes I am even praised for my work.

Right now I am looking for another job (as the first job is designed to be only part of my career and my employer also knows that). I already have my first job offer, although I felt unprepared in the interview and certainly could have done a lot of things better. While the job offer does not suit my needs/wishes perfectly, I feel the growing desire to spend less effort on the other applications I want to/could/should send out (especially when considering that I got a job offer without writing an application).

Do you know that feeling? Is it OK? Why should I reach for more? I'm confused, to be honest.

Thanks a lot,

Getting life on track got off to a bad start: I slept in and was an hour and a half late for work. This meant that not only was I late to work and lost pay, but also that I missed breakfast. THEN someone brought in delicious pastries, and with an empty stomach that's going down the hatch without a question. And of course, I didn't bring lunch with me, so a snack from the vending machine was all I got. 
 

On a better note, I started down the track to physical fitness. For today, I drug my way through ~25 minutes of a the p90x cardio dvd. I would have gone running, as was my original goal, but the rain has scared me indoors.I could be doing muscle training, but one of the things I've learned from past failures at fitness is that my heart is a bit of a pussy. He make me puke, even when my muscles could stand for a little extra punishment, so before I work on strength, I need general fitness. Now, as it has been pointed out to me, I should have some clearer goals than simply ""stop being a lazy-ass"", so here we are:

* Run each day or every other day
* spend at least a half an hour studying German
* Spend about an hour working on computer code

These are just 3 daily goals, and only minimums. I can do more provided I:

* Do the minimum in EVERY category
* Still do everything tomorrow. There are no rollover minutes

Thank you to all of you who are willing to keep an eye on me, and wish me luck tomorrow!

I never had a problem being motivated before. Now my life is still hell. My sense of motivation to just do the things I enjoy has gone. 

My story (prepare for a short novel): 

I grew up poor, neglected, and having to raise and teach my self in many ways. I always paid attention in school, but usually knew more than what the curriculum thought I should. I spent most of my time at the library or seeking new things to learn, finding new ways to interact with the world and understand it. As time went on, I dropped out of school in 8th grade and decided I'd be better off learning on my own. At age 16 I earned my High School Diploma through a state other than my home, but couldn't go on to college just yet because I was still financially hurting. At age 18, 2009, I was fortunate to meet a nice family who helped me find a way to get to college at no cost to myself. I was ecstatic, but I found myself more easily distracted as the first semester wore on, the second, the third. Now, it wasn't just my fault you see, in the second and third I had various upheavals come upon me rapidly in 2010: I became homeless quite suddenly, lost both jobs I was working (each because of the other), and other romantic issues. I took a summer and a semester break to try to get stable, but to no avail. While 'couch surging' for awhile, I tried to work on my third semester and this is when I noticed my motivation start to dwindle; I couldn't find the motivation to go to my 3 classes, even though I KNEW if I didn't I'd be dropped from financial aid and probably lose any chance of getting back into school from there. 

Between 2010 to just about 4 or 5 months ago, I was forced to move from place to place, never able to lay down roots, I was homeless. Even still, I was able to find stability for a couple months here or there, and currently am living with my significant other and their family. Even with this (albeit temporary) stability, I find myself always tired, easily drained, in many forms of pain, and unable to sleep normally.

Some detail should be given about my passion and current 'tasks at hand' as it were. When I was younger, I always loved to tinker, figure out how things worked, then work out how to put them back together. In my preadolescence, I developed a keener interest in electronics and mechanics, as well as language and many other topics. It was then that I decided I will always aspire to be a true renaissance man. In 2008 my interest in computers and electronics had sparked larger than ever and I started on my way to becoming a technical guru as well as continued my pursuit of becoming a renaissance man.  Now, here in 2013, I have a reasonable level of experience, enough to land any IT or System Administrator job, but I haven't been able to yet. The hurdle now, is myself. As I said prior, my motivation slowly started leaving me a couple years ago, and I have a hard time even finding interest in what I love: computers intrigue me but so what; I love reading and have many book to choose from but why bother. Currently, I need to work on revising my resumé and work on my computer, I need to clean and organize, I must do several things, not a lot, but more than a little. I just don't have any drive to do these tasks. 

I don't know exactly how I got here, nor do I know how to get back. I was hoping I might be able to find some assistance with this here, hence my posting. 

**TL;DR: Always been a self driven person: self educated, over achiever, work-to-the-bone-until-the-job-is-done work ethic. Yet, lately I have lost this about me and am having trouble getting back. Constantly tired/drained/sore/sluggish, even my thoughts have been slowed. I wish to get my deep motivation back.**

A spider was in my room last night I started screaming and crying ran away and gathered up the courage to find a shoe and slowly creep towards it to kill it... 8 times... But after that I was still shaking and crying for a good 15 minutes after it was dead.

I save approximately 75%-80% of my income.  The main things I spend my money on are necessities, such as rent, food, and medicine.  I more or less see this as an annoyance, but I know that if I don't spend this money I'll be worse off.  The reason is simple, it cuts into my potential to save more money.

When it comes to personal entertainment or something, I often feel like I should save my money.  Since this is often a small amount ($1-$200) it's easier for me part ways with my money but I still feel like I shouldn't.  Again, it's because it cuts into my potential to save more.

The largest purchases I've ever made are my computers (Most of my free time is spent on my PC) and my tools for work (Necessity).  These purchases are often years apart so it's not that bad.  In general, I always go for the best quality available based on my research.  I wouldn't consider my self to be ""cheap.""

The main issue comes with big purchases I know I will need to make in the future.  A car is a great example.  I know I could buy a brand new car, but I know it's a better value to get something used.  The problem with buying used is that the car may be a piece of garbage and it ends up being a bad deal.  In fact, I consider this the main part of my problem.

I **always** want the perfect thing even though I know that's impossible.  If a car could last forever and cost $500, that would be a great deal.  I know that this doesn't exist, but I feel if I spend my money on anything that isn't perfect, it's a waste.  I've managed to negotiate a few decent deals on cars and other things, but I never go for it because of this feeling.

In a way, I feel like it comes from my lack of experience with these things.  I'm a young adult in my early-mid twenties so all of this is a first time for me.  I know I'll eventually have to move out and live on my own, but this really annoys me and stresses me out.  The idea that I'll have to spend more money on rent, food, internet, and other things really bothers me.  All because it cuts into my potential savings.

In the end, the question is, what am I saving my money for?  I've gone through this many times with my self and don't have an answer.

Basically, I save all my money for something.  When there's something I may want, I probably won't buy it because I need to save.  In the end, I'm saving for nothing.",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_1f4avt,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1f4avt/i_hate_spending_my_money/,

Re / cross posting. :)


I'm a 18y.o. M who hasn't had the best high school experience. I sort of roamed friend groups throughout my 4 years, and sort-of found that ""friend circle"" during my senior year--but even then I felt a bit distant.


This roaming friend-groups thing wasn't all that bad in my mind -- I got to know more people, and I try my best to be personable with each and every person. The only issue with this, of course, if that I never really got close with one smaller circle of friends.


I've always been ""that guy who will listen to your problems"", which I really don't mind. I'm decently quiet at school, usually helping others before I help myself. I've been told I bring in different perspectives on the situations that are brought to me -- most likely because I people watch, and think a lot when I'm not doing anything.


I've never been in a relationship, and I've definitely had infatuated feelings for girls in the past 4 years of high school. I've gotten to know them, tried to help them with their problems (or at least listened to them) -- and if I felt like the infatuation was getting to me, I would straight up tell the girl. 


I’ve always been big on being open and honest, and if something is bugging me or is consistently on my mind, I will bring it to the person without a second thought. I can recall a few times where I simply said ""I like you."" to a girl’s face. All of them have obviously ended in rejection, but it doesn't really get me down that often. I mean, it’s mostly infatuation, so it wasn't that ""deep"" of a relationship.


The reason I’m posting this is because I’m starting to think that the reason I haven’t been in a relationship yet is because of one of three factors:


1) It’s the people at my high school; it isn’t me, but them.


2) It’s me; the way that I treat myself (ie self-deprecating humor, which is sometime seen as pessimistic), or how I have no confidence in myself (which is true, but I don’t really mention it unless they note it.)


3) It’s the way that I act around others, not so much their fault or mine; the whole “I’ll listen to your problems” might be putting me in a “friends only” category – which I wouldn’t mind in most cases, but sometimes when I have those infatuated feelings, I feel like I’ve already dug myself in that hole.


A part of is deciding against writing this entire thing. I probably sound like the average angst-y teenager. A part of me also wants to try and understand the way that I act, and what causes me to do these things.


I want to possibly work on some self-improvement things that could help me become a “more than friends” option to people. I’m going to be going to college in a few months, so I thought this summer would be the time to work on myself, since I won’t be having that many plans anyways. :P

It involves a sort of tension centred in my chest and present throughout my upper body. It can be associated with concerns that the work involved and/or the eventual result would suck, but often I don't notice any thoughts connected with it. The feeling can be about large tasks, but it can also be about trivial small tasks which don't involve significant time, effort or consequences.

Changes in mood or setting change how often these feelings come up. For some activities, I only get the ""NOOOO!"" feeling when I'm not feeling good and/or in some settings. For other activities, I haven't encountered situations where the feeling doesn't arise.

Sometimes, it seems the right course of action is to do the action anyways, despite the ""NOOOO!"" feeling it triggers. However, that's very draining and I cannot sustain a lot of that. More importantly, sometimes it seems like the feeling sends an important intuitive message telling me that what I'm doing really isn't a good idea, and I should try something different. The feeling isn't very useful for that though, because it involves a tight focus on what I shouldn't do, instead of creativity about what I should do instead.

I anticipate the worst case scenario to happen so that I might have a reason to attack somebody. It's a primal, juvenile, barbaric way of carrying yourself, but that's just how I get by. Since I was 14, I've always drawn on violence as the remedy for my ailments - from the most menial aggravation, to a serious provocation, I've always leaned towards the use of my physicality instead of my mentality to solve a problem. I remember when I was 15, my girlfriend of the time and I ran into her ex-boyfriend, who was some alleged badass straight from a Guy Ritchie film, and he was just staring at us. We were in line at a Tim Horton's, and I was talking to her about it. ""What the fuck does this guy think he's looking at? Am I some kind of fucking spectacle? Am I a marvel? Is he a fucking queer?"" And she would do the typical, ""baby, please don't. Just forget about it."" And I tried, but he didn't stop staring at me, so I took it as a physical challenge. I kissed her forehead and told her I'd be right back, and I walked up to his table, and just suckered him as hard as I could. I remember his head rocked so violently that it hit the window behind him, and then that's all I remember. The next thing from that day that comes to mind is my hand being swollen, and her bawling her eyes out, scared of me getting in trouble, which I didn't. Instead, he and his cronies decided to jump me one day after school, and that was that. There was no ill blood on my half anymore. I rocked his world, and he rocked mine. He got me the way he thought would best, and that's that. It's honourable to stand up for yourself, albeit less-so in the way that he did. Her and I ended up breaking up, and blah blah blah. We were together for a year and a half, I think, and when she left, I'd started spiraling out of control, and at this time my older brother was just getting out of prison. He had been sentenced to 9 months for assault causing bodily harm. He had turned 18 2 months before his sentencing.

When my brother got out, he indulged in his old habits; alcohol, coke, sex, and violence. I was inclined to indulge also, as I was rapidly approaching a state of depression. He protested, but ultimately gave in, and we started doing drugs with our cousins and ""crew"" for some years - during which I developed a drug addiction, that I am now, thankfully, free of. The further I went down the line, the more violent I got. I went from consented fist fights, to violently attacking people with collapsible batons, and brass knuckles. On some occasions, I'd even attacked them with a knife. I was convicted, and served 8 months as an adult when I was 17. Upon my release, I'd imagined that it was time to straighten out. No more drugs, no more booze, no more fights. ""No more nothin', Bi,"" as my dad would put it. It was a long, upward battle, but now I'm clean, and entering a paid carpentry program, but I fear that I might regress to my former state; I feel the overwhelming urge to fight, and attack, and just do outwardly bad things to other people. If I don't acknowledge the desire, it begins to take a physical toll on me; I can feel a sort of restlessness in my arms, and a cold emotional numbness. This can last weeks before finally dissipating, and thankfully I'm ""strong"" enough, as it were, to fight the temptation. But I don't know what to do anymore; I almost attacked somebody in a store near my house because they were being obnoxiously loud, and insulting the store owner, whose name is Joshua and is of South Korean descent, and so obviously the need for racial slurs became pertinent. I spoke up, and asked him to calm down, and to stop treating the store owner in the manner that he was, and he was a big tough guy until he turned to face me. I'm not very tall, but I'm 215lbs.; I'm a ""natural bodybuilder"", if you will. No supplements, and hardly any gym equipment. Just a high protein diet, and strict exercising schedule. Either way, he looks at me and decides that this isn't the fight he wants to pick, and so he does his thing, and leaves. But that's irrelevent at this point, and I'm rambling again; I just don't know what to do anymore. My lust for violence isn't inherently angry, so anger management served no purpose for me, and speaking to a counselor or whatever the fuck they're called really didn't help much either. Not with my desire to fight people, but she did, however, help with my depression, and such.

I was wondering what are your best tricks for initiating a study session?

Once I do get into it though, which I usually do after a few hours, I can keep on for a long time.

This isn't really a problem, I can do what I need to get done. But being a student at heart and not just on paper, I really do wish I could get even more than that done and study things outside of my curriculum (to a greater extent than I already am).

Apart from the initial 2-3 hours lag from sitting down with my books to actually learning something, I've also heard from reputable sources that 20-30 minute sessions with short breaks are optimal for learning (and these obviously aren't feasible with such a long start) - if that's true there's even more learning I could push in.

About a week ago, my cousin (who is my best friend) drunkenly told me that she knows who I am inside, but that is not at all how I am perceived and that i *need* to change.

My mother whom I admire more than any person in the world has told me throughout my life (and more frequently as time goes on) that I have no compassion- at all. none whatsoever. A lot of this stems from my treatment of my brother's string of girlfriends throughout the years (who have all been either significantly younger than him, or on drugs. or both).  I have never been mean to them, I just simply do not acknowledge them. My parents always want to help these girls, which often becomes a point of contention, because I see them as a poor influence on my hyper-emotional, unstable brother, and they see them as people that need their help. 

But I do care about people.  When one of my brother's ex's passed away last summer, I cried for a week straight.  I often think about her and how lovely she was, and it makes me cry.  Although I am sure she died thinking that I hated her.

I love my parents more than anything in the entire world. I would never speak poorly of them and would be devastated if anything happened to them.  I rarely show this side, however.  I often find myself getting annoyed when I speak to them and have to cut conversations short to keep myself from snapping at them when they ask probing questions about my life. 

I also have fits of rage when I am frustrated and at that point, I really feel that I could kill someone.  When this happens, I feel nothing for the person who has made me angry (and it is always someone very close to me: ie- close friend/family member).  I have learned the best way to handle this rage is to completely avoid the person until the rage passes, and in the meantime, if someone is around to vent to, I will say terrible things about the person I am angry with (that I deeply care about), unless it is my mother- I never ever have the urge to say mean things about her. 

Aside from my rage, I genuinely care about people.  I am very generous, and I love helping people.  I go out of my way to help people.  I just find it damn near impossible to show people that I care in any other way than doing nice things for them.  If I complimented someone, it would be disingenuous.  It's just not how I think. I also cannot bear to see people being attacked, bullied, left out, etc., and I like to defend the person who is being ganged up on (in work situations, social situations, etc).

In my relationships I have always been faithful, loyal, truthful, and trusting.  Yet all of my ex boyfriends have told me that I am impossible so say the least, and all have cheated.  

Some personal background: I am a 24 year old female with a bachelor's degree. I am the youngest of 2.  I am very attached to my mother, and have had a very strained/weak relationship with my father. My older brother is very protective of me and I believe he and my mother to be the 2 people that I care about most.

I have been described by others as: Outspoken, opinionated, loud, charming, witty, entertaining, driven, independent, strong, stuck up, snobby, mean, angry, sarcastic, unsympathetic, self-centered and most common IMPOSSIBLE.

Please understand that i want to change, and I am being as candid as possible. If you have dealt with a person that sounds like me I would love to hear how they made you feel, and what you wish you could change in them.  Or if you think that I have some sort of personality disorder (I have been accused of have Narcissistic Personality Disorder before).  Any sort of constructive criticism would help, but please no bashing.

I think it started in my later teenage years.

Sometimes, I'll hear someone say something, and I completely misunderstand it. As in, I can hear them quite clearly, but there's a hiccup in my brain translating the sound into words I understand, even if I ask them to repeat.

Oftentimes, what I mishear and repeat back to the person is 'dirty', and we'll all get a good laugh from it. Other times, it's not so fun. I spent a few weeks being trained at an alarm monitoring center, where we monitor thousands of different locations and when something trips, and certain conditions are met, we call the location to see if they need help. One time, I got a medical alarm, and an elderly person answered the phone. He said something, and even though the connection was good and I heard him clearly, I had absolutely no idea what he said. I asked him to repeat two times and he said whatever he was saying twice more. It just didn't compute. It didn't even sound like gibberish, because you can repeat gibberish back. If someone asked me to repeat his gibberish, I couldn't. I couldn't form the sounds to repeat what he said. 

Luckily, his wife chimed in and said ""just testing!"", so there was no risk there. But that's when I decided I had to quit that job. If I totally misunderstood someone and it resulted in death or injury, I don't think I'd be able to live normally after that.

I took AP Psych in high school, and we learned about the different areas of the brain (my favorite part of the course), and I know there's separate areas responsible for hearing and understanding. I don't know if that has anything to do with it or not.

Formerly depressed person here with a few tips on getting over life problems.  This mainly applies to people with situations they can get themselves out of.


1. Accept the immoral sides of life.  Not everything you should do is something you should be proud of.  Cutting off friends, refusing to lend money, skipping church.  You'll often find yourself in situations where doing what feels wrong is best for you.  Procrastinating or avoiding tough decisions because they're not going to sit well with your conscience isn't going to help you in the long run.

2.  Just do it.  Reading about stuff and doing stuff are two totally different activities.  When you hit a lifestyle problem, you'll want to tackle it by reading some background information on it before you try and address it.  At some point though, every unit of energy you spend looking for a solution to your problem is less energy spent on solving it.  

And let's be honest, we all know the activities everyone is supposed to do.  Eat right, exercise, meditate, be kind, volunteer, balance a budget, focus on the present, etc. etc.  Whether you consult religion or self-help forums, you can eventually come up with a mental model for how an ideal version of you would map out their day.  Create a plan to start becoming that person and make headway every day.  Even if you miss your goals, just constantly make headway every day and you'll do fine.  Reading about making headway and having the 20th guru's blog tell you the same five things that will make your life better is not gonna help.

3.  Stay away from self-help forums.  Okay, so this might be a little controversial, but IMO, these places are pretty depressing.  They can quickly turn into whinefests, where you feel like you need to outdo fellow posters with talking about how sad your life is.  Either that, or you just stand in awe as someone describes a truly horrible life that you could never imagine living in.  I don't really like connecting with people over misery, it just makes your sadness seem more real.

If you want to be a better lover, go to a romance forum.  If you want to be smarter, go to a forum on your favorite subject (and get some books).  If you want to get buff, go to a fitness forum and a gym.  But try to form relationships dedicated on your mutual interest in some avenue of self-help rather than a need for self-help itself.

I really dislike my job, and where my life is headed. My job isn't horrible, I just find it incredibly mind numbing, boring, dead end, etc.  It was the first ( only) job I was offered post-college (BA in Econ), and I've been here for 2.5 years.  I desperately want to do something else, but I have no idea how to hone in on what it is I want to do.  I've thought about everything under the sun: going back to school, trying to find something new (this hasn't been working at all), travel (seems unrealistic).  Fact is, it never goes further than me just dreaming of something else.

So yeah, I'm trying to break out of this rut. I don't really have many passions, no real hobbies besides staying fit/athletic/reddit, and my job really gets me down.  I feel as though I'm not working towards anything, and it really gets me down.  ",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_s4kkg,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/s4kkg/i_feel_completely_lost/,

""You are lazy and worthless"", ""You can't do that"", ""Don't leave your comfort zone"", ""It's impossible!"" and so on. In other words: My ego is a big douche bag at the moment. It wants me to be a worried, anxious, mediocre pussy. 

Another problem of mine is that I can't forget all the bad things that happened when I was young. I was depressed and anxious from I was 14 to I was 17, and a result of that was that I isolated myself from the world. I just stayed home to drink coke and play video games. I had a few friends, but they started to avoid me after a while. 

I changed my habits this year. I started to work out, get away from the computer, try new things, meet new people and seek therapy. It helped a lot, and I would say I am mostly happy at the moment (other than when my ego and my past pop up). However; I can't stop thinking about how much time I wasted during my teenage years. I could have done all the things I started to do this year, when I was fourteen, but instead I decided to waste my youth on being depressed. I am 19, so I guess it's not too late to still have some fun while I'm young, but my past combined with the pain of regret, really affects my self esteem and how I view my life.

When I was a kid, I grew up in a very abusive family, so I didn't get many good lessons on how to treat other people, or how to tune into other people.

Another problem was that I was beat up a lot both physically and mentally whenever I cried, so I learned how to form an extremely joking and outgoing personality to compensate for it.

That created it's own problems...  I was then faulted for being ""too energetic"" so I grew up hating-hating-hating my own high level of energy.  

In the long run, I ended up as a [""DO ALL THE THINGS!""](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/x-all-the-y) kind of impulsive person socially.  Fortunately I never got into any sort of mind-altering substances, since the level of energy I had was pretty much the equivalent of being born with some kind of adrenalin-shot drug from just being alive.

Being raised in an abusive family means that I had no clue what empathy was. Since no fellow humans ever tuned into me, I had no idea how to tune into and really connect with other humans.  I wanted to hang out and connect with people.  So I impulsively, happily would roar on in to whatever social situation, be my joking, energetic self - and then get inwardly very terrified afterwards that maybe I did something stupid to get rejected and didn't know it.  I've been though the pain of realizing I was the loud bulldozer AGAIN, that I was the subject of talking behind my back for being too outrageous and then hated-hated-hated myself for it.

Also my normal speaking voice is LOUD. Like hurting-others-eardrums loud.   Combine that with the fact that I can't hear my own default voice level, which means I KNOW I offend people.  Then I get anxious about ""dammit, I'm probably offending people"" which caused anxiety which would make all my extrovert tendencies worse and then I get louder.  Then the spiral gets worse.

I remember how painful it was to watch polite people who seemed to move with a quiet grace I never had. People who spoke correctly and with the right amount of gentle energy, people who were not ""made of rejection stuff"" as I saw myself.  I wanted to be like the gracious people who had a social clue but I had the wrong energy for it.  I was always like a walking cringe.  

Only recently has it dawned on me that people who have that quiet grace may have been raised in that strange concept known as a ""loving family."" So being able to have the right energy level and constant sense of personal grace might not be because I am personally defective.  I still feel like a walking cringe, though.

Once in awhile I find people reacting to my impulsive energy as if I was some kind of charismatic, inspiring, gotta-get-to-know-'em kind of person (whaaaaat?) and then they want to stay in touch with me.  I then tend to shy away from further contact because getting closer to me would mean them having to get to know all the depressing stuff I have inside - and I'd already done all this false advertising up front.  My tendency then is just to cherish the fact that I seemed to have had a positive interaction that one time, not wanting to ruin it by risking a possibly more depressing interaction with them afterwards.

Inside, I am a shy, introspective, VERY sad person.  I have already been through too many incidents where I thought I made a new friend and as soon as I was honest about what I am really about, I never hear from them again.  So I am pretty much alone.

For many years, I've made a point of studying as much self-help and psychology books as I could so that I could figure out how to become the person I want to be.  I learned about how to listen, how to reflect what the other person is saying and I've advocated that ever since.  But my nervous energy makes it so that I have a hard time DOING it.  I feel like I can't trust myself in social situations.

In the last year or so, I ended up being able to talk to both a speech therapist and an expert in anxiety. They helped me figure out that my loud voice was connected with my high anxiety level.  The more anxious I was on the inside, the louder more energetic and more impulsive I got on the outside.  (unfortunately, I can't afford the good therapist anymore, and she was the best one I've ever had.)

Little did I know then that the more I hated my own energy level, the worse my impulsive energy got.   Same for my voice level.  

Considering that I have severe PTSD due to the abuse issues, I have a long way to go about trying to calm down the anxiety.  I still find myself still impulsively engaging in the loud, impulsive talk-talk-talk-too-much behaviors when I am with others, so I am mostly staying by myself now.  

I REALLY wish I could somehow connect my shy/introspective true self with others and have my real inside self be able to have friends.  I don't know... if I open my mouth, it's the impulsive extrovert talking, not me.  If I don't talk, I'm alone.  Dammit, I'm alone either way.

I wish I could detect when I am being too loud, when I am being too energetic, being too impulsive when I am being too 'all the damn things I wish I was wasn't'.  

I really want to be the quiet, gracious person I dream of being on the outside...  I feel so damn sad that I am NOT that person I want to be.  :(

show that life experiences in the domains of love and work are associated with personality trait change.” (p. 7)

""The crux of the process of personality development, within the social investment framework, lies in committing oneself to social institutions outside of one’s existing identity structure. This act exposes a person to the contingencies contained in the new social role, expressed in the form of role expectations for appropriate behavior (Sarbin, 1967), set forth by the self and the collective other.... Such role expectations can effect change through either punishing inappropriate behavior or rewarding appropriate behavior.

""The implication of the social investment principle is that investments in conventional social institutions should be related to elevated scores on measures of social dominance, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability and to increases in these dimensions over time. An important distinction is whether investment is captured in* acquiring the role* or in the psychological qualities of *investing in the role*. It is the latter psychological investments that are more critical, as people can occupy social roles, such as a job or a marriage, yet not be invested in these roles. So, rather than examining whether people are working, what is critical is *how* they are working and the expectations they have for themselves and the expectations that others have for them in these roles."" (p. 9)

(quoted from [this paper](http://internal.psychology.illinois.edu/~broberts/Roberts,%20Wood,%20&amp;%20Smith,%202005.pdf))

**TLDR:** So my takeaway from this is that it backs up some common self-help advice:

* If you want to change, you should get out of your comfort zone and put yourself in new situations.
* You should surround yourself, as much as possible, with people you'd like to be like, with qualities you admire.

It's nice to see research backing up good advice and confirming that change *is* possible. :)",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,t3_mcdvf,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/mcdvf/research_on_how_personalities_change/,

Sometimes it's phrased as ""Do what you love and the money will follow.""

I've always been a little skeptical of that advice, although I'm not sure if I was being reasonable or just giving in to limitations and fears.

Anyway, I just read a comment to [this blog post](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/07/nobodys-going-to-help-you-and-thats-awesome.html) that says:

&gt;As to the top of your post where you talk (a la The Donald) about doing what you love, I find there are three kinds of people:
&gt;1. What they love to do has inherent economic value.
&gt;2. What they love to do could have economic value if someone else who understands the value in what they do continually assigns them tasks with value.
&gt;3. What they love to do has no useful economic value.
&gt;
&gt;People in the first group have a clear path. They are not guaranteed success but they can pursue it independently.
&gt;
&gt;People in the second group depend on effective managers to be successful. They could become millionaires or go from low paying job to low paying job, depending largely on whether they are fortunate enough to hook up with the right people.
&gt;
&gt;People in the third group will either do something they don't love or live off the productive output of others.
&gt;
&gt;Often people in the first group have ""advice"" for people in the other groups. They should STFU.

(search for ""Matthew Kane"" to find this comment)

I'm just wondering what people think about this. Do you agree with the commenter? Or does everyone have the capacity to make their living doing something they're truly passionate about?

And if you suspect you're in the 2nd or 3rd category, what are your best options for a satisfying career/work life?

To me it doesn't feel like being defensive at all, whenever a person says something (bad) about me, my personality or my actions I feel stupid and have a need to explain myself, so they won't think badly of me. But because/when I'm explaining why I did what I did it comes across as defensive.

Anytime anything bad happens to anyone around me, my first reaction (almost instinct) is to think how it is my fault. And if I find a way it could be my fault, I feel super bad and try to think of ways to bring it up so I can let them know I'm sorry. The only problem is half the time I didn't even do anything to make them angry!

When I was being raised by my aunt as a child, she was depressed and bipolar. In other words, very very irritable. So anytime I did anything, no matter good or bad, everything was my fault. It's kind of just pounded into my brain because I thought that was normal, that everyone has a short fuse, so I've lived tiptoeing around everyone.  I'm a very nice and genuine person, but I can seem fake at times because I do everything I can to not make someone angry.  I also suppress anger and sadness because I don't want to interrupt anyone's lives with my emotions. Mostly because I don't want to make people feel the way that I felt. I know when my thoughts are being impulsive and do not express them. I wait for myself to cool down so I can sort out facts from emotions.

So how the heck do I get myself to stop thinking like this?! I'm sick of searching people's body signals to see if I did anything to make them angry, but it's just natural to me.

I've had a couple major girlfriends in my life, which all lasted at least 2 years or more. I get very attached pretty quick, but so do the girls I date, it seems. I have been cheated on, but my last girlfriend is the killer one, who cheated on me so many times and I, like a schmuck, kept taking her back over and over. We were together for 3 or 4 years, and it, I thought, was a great relationship, but I think I was fooling myself. Anyway, I think she really screwed me up, but I'm not trying to pawn all my problems off on her.  
  
I think I have major trust issues, or jealousy issues, or possessive issues, or all of the above. I can't help but feel angry or suspicious when my current girlfriend talks to other guys if I'm not there. It sounds so silly writing it down here, but it's definitely a problem. It isn't as bad as it used to be, and I think it's getting better, and I know my current girlfriend wouldn't cheat on me or anything, but my brain seems to always want to think something bad will/is happen(ing) and I feel suspicious for no good reason.  
  
For example, she has this ""group"" thing twice a week, mandatory. Twice so far when I pick her up she's walked out the door talking to a good looking guy who is also in the group, but it makes me so mad and I can't help but think of all the ""what ifs'."" What if they exchange numbers, would she tell me if she hung out with him? Is he trying to pick her up? Etc etc.. I've even jokingly made comments about it, and she understands, sort of. She knows about my ex, and knows that I am in this way (to an extent... I try not to make a fuss about things, but if I don't mention it I will dwell on it forever), and insists so much that nothing will happen, she loves me, etc. And I know this to be true, but I still can't help getting these feelings.  
  
What can I do to get over this shit? I feel like it's a major problem and can eventually lead to something unhealthy. I feel like this was caused, or at least brought about by my ex girlfriend and me trusting her so much that I believed her over and over that ""she changed"" and would never cheat or lie again, but always did. I'm still hurt when I think about it, but I feel like I've been making a lot of steps toward getting over her, especially recently.  
  
I write this now because I kind of had an issue today, thinking about that same dude in her group, and it always spirals out of control in my head. Then I dwell on it and dwell on it and I start to believe these ridiculous thoughts and almost convince myself something is or will happen.  
  
I want this to stop. I do feel like I trust my girlfriend, and I believe her and I do know she loves me. I don't want to lose her, I feel like she's very good for me, and she does so much for me.  
  
So I don't know, I don't want to just ramble on, but I feel like I have some major trust/jealousy/possessive issues, and I recognize it is a problem, and I want to get over it, but I don't know how.  
What can I do? I've been trying to stay positive and eat healthy and all that jazz, and I've been taking Rhodiola Rosea which has been helping my lack of energy and motivation to an extent, but I need to do something more to get over this, I just have no idea how.

* Get out of the house nightly (walks, the park, library, reading, volunteering, bicycling, visiting friends)
* Don't buy anything new
* run, run run (finish my Couch to 5K program)
* Better separate work/personal life (in @8, out @5)
* Stop being afraid! (this needs some expansion, though)
* Save 25% of that fat paycheck.
* No smoking. Anything. For a while.
* Hit the gym
* Meditate on a regular basis.

Today I had a wonderful day doing lots of fun stuff with friends and colleagues of mine. But when I got back home I just couldn't sleep. I had realised that what my friend thought of me wasn't real because of all the lies she beleived.

I think that deep down i've always known that i've got some sort of a problem but recent events in my life have convinced me that I need to confront this. A while ago I noticed that no matter what kind of questions people asked me I kept inventing lies on-the-spot for no reason instead of just answering the truth. I also noticed that I kept inveting false explanations when the real reason would have been enough. My life is what it is right now because of those lies. I have lied to my parents, family, friends and colleagues. This has to stop.

So, now that I want to fix this situation what should I do ? I'm still studying in college, so my current idea is to go see if the school has any services could help me (like a psychiatrist for example) and see what happens from there.

I have to admit that what scares me right now is that sooner or later i'm going to have to confront the ppl that I lied to and when it's gonna be my friends it won't be pretty. Some might never forgive me.

1292055287.0,8,self.selfhelp,ejzzh,Not enough attention / affection from parents / family.  Now 30 yr old.,8,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/ejzzh/not_enough_attention_affection_from_parents/,"**tl;dr : mommy and daddy didn't love me enough and it fucked me up.**

Title says it all.  Felt...less than loved, or barely loved growing up.  Parents ""stayed together for the kids"" then divorced when we were all ""old enough"".  

Bounced though a few private schools + home school + lived in a neighborhood with few kids = few friends throughout life, lonely, etc.

*Examples of neglect :* 

Got use to being let down by dad when I was a kid.  Not sure why/how totally.  Remember he was going to build me a club house and only put the four post in the ground.  I remember looking at the post thinking ""wow this will be cool"".  Then nothing.  Remember being surprised when we *actually* went to a roller coaster park when I was a kid.

Dad was the coach of my baseball team, forgot to put me on the batting line up.

Dad talked about kicking me out of the house when I was like, 10 or 11.  

When I was teenage ish and the pc was in my room I'd sometimes wake up to dad smoking a cig with his feet on my bed (pc @ the head of the bed...).

Dad forgot to call me for my 30th birthday.

Grandpa (dads side, incidentally) - forgot to pick me up for a fishing trip.

Grandma (dads side) was kind but not super loving, imho.

Try doing family stuff with dad (including his bday) and he's sometimes too distracted with his friends to pay attention to his kids.

Mom was better but not affectionate / caring enough.  She worked nights a lot so dad was the main one on the scene during ""after school hours"". 

Even when I was like, mid teenage years, my mom was clueless as to what foods i liked, or that i didnt eat certain common foods *at all*. 

**More boring stuff here**

Thinking back dad was actually kinda mean / grumpy / etc.  Though ""I can't blame him"" or some shit.  Hard job, hard hours, tired a lot, etc.  I don't really remember a lot of growing up, snap shots - I've always had a fairly bad memory for the day to day stuff.

Don't get me wrong, parents weren't hitler but it wasn't a cake walk.

I remember feeling a deep loneliness / sadness / rejection after my first brother was born.  He had asthma and required a lot of special attention.  I was only like 5 so of course I did not understand this.

Grew up with very few friends, mainly on the pc as much as possible since I was 13.  Lost mt virginity to a chick from the net (back in 97 bitches, eat it) and have fucked many chicks from the net.  When you have few / scattered friends its hard to get out, when its hard to get out its hard to meet people, when its hard to meet people its hard to go out.

I was a bad kid for attention but it wasn't crazy stuff like burning down houses or killing cats.  I got in trouble a lot pretty much my whole life.  Not so much with the law, not on purpose anyhow.  Actually, ya - a lot with the law, and on purpose.  But small stuff like expired registration.  

Been smoking weed nearly every day since I was 18 / 19 ish.

I'm actually pretty attractive / smart / funny but for a long time there i was fucking chicks not as attractive (on my scale).

Use to be jealous / curious / etc about people who had a really set sense of self.

Since I didn't have a lot of friends I didn't see how a lot of other parents interacted with their kids.  But in one case I remember being like ""wow this is like a for real family"".

So I'm all growed up now but I still feel kinda like a kid in some ways.  Fucked up sense of self / self esteem.  Crave attention, dress for attention, etc.  My bros were / are attention whores and I use to despise them for it.  I felt it was base an transparent so I didn't do it, and I didn't get as much attention.  So I'm like, super sensitive to neglect now.  For srs.

I can relate a lot to [borderline personality disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder#Signs_and_symptoms).  I don't ""connect"" well with others.

It's usually pretty easy for me to talk about my emotions / history and stuff because I don't feel connected to it.

For the past three years, I've been running a self-help blog named [The Lonely Savage](http://www.lonelysavage.com). The activity has been sporadic, netting me anywhere between 1 and 2000 hits daily, depending on the activity that I put in myself. Today, I'm getting somewhere in the vicinity of 75 to 125 hits a day.

I would like to extend an offer to you, the Reddit SelfHelp community to write guest posts for my blog. I'm looking for one a week for the next month (or longer, if possible). They would have to be about self-help in any way that you can conjure up the word, whether it be about interesting mnemonic techniques that have helped you become a better student, the way you quit smoking/drinking/doing drugs, the way you motivated yourself to start working out or even just a nice way of Getting Things Done that you've been using.

But what's in it for you? Well, every entry would be preceded with a text describing you, my guest writer of the week, along with links to your Blog, Twitter, Facebook Page or whatever it is you want people to see. It is a great opportunity to get your writings out there into the general public's eye and to get people to notice you that may not have done so otherwise.

Get in touch with me via PM or comment below and let's see what we can work out!

I was raised by an alcoholic mother who let her drinking severely change her personality.  When she drank, she made impulsive and often melodramatic decisions that I'm sure she regretted later on.  While I was growing up, I observed my mother making these decisions and perceived it as the ""proper"" way to live.

My mother passed away when I was 16.  I am 21 now, and since she passed, I've been struggling a great deal in most areas of my life.  I suppose I'm depressed.  

I recently entered a relationship with a very kind soul.  Unfortunately, my SO has had issues of his own.  He is 24.  His father passed away when he was 17.  Since his father's passing, my SO has not gotten close to anyone and has developed severe social anxiety (he has a hard time even walking down the street),

My SO and I got into a fight and he said that I ""create problems when they aren't there.""  I didn't disagree with him.  I often feel unloved by my SO because he is not good at showing affection (abandonment issues, etc.).  I create problems or claim I am upset by something tiny...just so that he'll pay attention to me.  

I want a big dramatic show of affection and miles of cuddles.  But I mostly just feel tolerated...which ends up hurting me and then I get REALLY upset...and thus the problem.  

Why can't I just be happy?  Not stir up any problems?  I want to love him beautifully--like the wind.  I want to come and go without being needy.  I want to love him unconditionally.  At some point my love became selfish.  

I'm worried I'm only happy when there's something going wrong.  Is it possible to be bored with happiness?

And I have no idea what I'm doing or where to start besides the old fashioned envelope system. 2. Going along with money is social, I'm tired of being home alone all the time or constantly going out to drink, which I can't afford to do anymore and don't want to do anymore, and it's a reason why I'm broke, my only social interaction is going to the bars. The only time I see my friends is when we are drinking, my apartment is bare so nobody comes over, I always go to other people which again, causes money problems, I have no money to decorate to invite people over. 3. Which leads into incredible loneliness and boredom, which causes me to get bored, which causes me to leave my apartment which in turn causes me to spend money because on top of finances, I'm trying to quit smoking and lose weight, no smoking saves money, eating healthy saves money but both are incredibly stressful and my friends and family again don't understand my lifestyle changes and choices. 

I just feel like I'm swirling the drain! This leads to that which in turn causes this which leads back to that and so it's  this never ending cycle I need to break. Can anyone help me find a break to this pattern? Any suggestions is appreciated! Thank you!

I have been doing everything medication-wise to fix it, but it seems useless. Lately it has gotten much worse. Needless to say, it's getting to the point I have to change my long hair, most likely getting rid of it all, as there's now a bald spot and thinning on top of the recession.

One main problem I have with shaving it all off is that I hate sticking out, and I feel like I will considering I'm still in college. There's also the ""girl""/dating scenario that I can't ignore. The whole manliness of a shaved head isn't something I'm super comfortable with either (I never identified as super manly), but I feel like it has to be done because balding isn't a great look, and it's not helping me any. 

How can I accept myself and gain some self-confidence back? I don't want to cringe every time I look in the mirror or worry about it every time I go out.

There arent any interesting stories that happened the day before. There arent any meals to be shared with and talked over. The smiles I share seem to be fake in which they’re simply put on just because I need to say “hello”, or “Have a nice day”.

Thinking about how I’m going to go everywhere in the summer but probably end up sitting in my room watching movies alone. Thinking about how everyone is ultimately a hypocrite.

Recently (last 7-8 months) I've been trying my best, everyday from 6am to 2-3am with a 1-2 hour lunchtime nap, chasing what you might call the classic 'American dream'. Unfortunately, I was hospitalised last week due to exhaustion and the doctor said that I was very lucky that I didn't do any hard permanent damage to myself. 

After getting released, I stopped working entirely for a week; just playing video games, catching up on movies and books. I started eating meals at the same time everyday and sleep from 10 to 5,with a nap during lunch. Surely enough, I'm getting much better physically. I feel more healthy, more energetic. However, it's absolutely killing me inside. It just feels as if for every second that I am asleep, it's a second wasted and a second further from achieving what I want. My body knows what it wants, but my brain is yearning for that dream even if that means death it seems. 

Yet, I'm starting to notice how much time I've missed out with my friends, how far behind I am in Games etc. and in a way I also want to participate in those 'fun' activities as well. My mental state these past week has been completely unstable, half of me wants to continue working but half of me wants to just enjoy myself in the moment.

I am a good counsellor, people can and often do talk to me about anything, I guess because I for so long needed someone to listen, I understand the importance of listening when someone is sharing.  But I am coming to realise that this is a very small part of being a friend, the side I just have no experience or knowledge of is how to have fun, how to share positive experiences.  

When others around me are having fun, I wish I could join in, wish I could be that relaxed around others, but I just can't - I have some self image issues which doesn't help - when I smile with my mouth open or laugh my entire row of top teeth show, and due to an incident in childhood my front teeth were damaged and the next teeth along pulled in and capped - they do not look great.  I know deep down that this should not matter, but it does, especially because I have no friends that I would say that I trust totally.  Some of my childhood abuse was perpetrated by 'friends' so I really struggle to trust.

I do not drink all that much, because when drunk I move quickly past the lowered inhibitions where I do find it easier to interact and drop down into an introspective paranoia which is no good for anyone.

I've always been a diplomatic and nonconfrontational person, while also being an introvert. Being extremely skinny till ~24 didn't help at all.

Because of all that, my social skills have suffered - I simply did not interact with people as much as other people of my age. I suffered from a lot of self-confidence issues, and this is the reason why I'm sometimes insecure even today, though I've worked on it quite a bit and it's not nearly as bad as it used to be.

So here is the thing. I am a software developer. I am good at what I do. I don't have any confidence issues there. I really honestly believe that I am a decent developer. But do I know how to sell that skill? Hell no.

In my interactions with coworkers, I often back down simply to defuse the argument, even when the other side didn't present any good evidence for their side. This doesn't happen just with coworkers, but it is [most obvious there](http://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/19jpec/need_advice_on_handling_an_egotripping_coworker/), because I'm starting to feel bad about not standing up for myself and my views, allowing people to bully me and trample over me, and ultimately - not showing my knowledge and my true self.

What actually happens underneath is that I panic. Any kind of confrontation (and sometimes even just a regular conversation) makes my adrenaline spike and my mind shits itself. Especially if the other person is loud and/or aggressive, but it's not always necessary.

I'm normally very analytical and can present my case in an email with almost perfect clarity, but put me in a room with my correspondent and I'm a sitting blabbering teary-eyed duck. (Teary eyes are often just an automatic response to my adrenaline rush..damn my genes.)

So my question is...is there anything I can do to remain calm during social interactions? How on earth do I stop panicking? Is there any way I can become more assertive?

About a year and a half ago I was on a jury in a murder trial. It was a brutal murder of a young woman by another young woman. It was extremely senseless and the Jury was never presented with a motive. Needless to say over 8 days we were presented with 100's of pictures of blood and the victims mutilated body. Ever since this I can't watch murder mysteries or horror flicks.

 I often get scared in my house at night that someone is going to come murder me. I cannot control these emotions and usually they pass quickly but sometimes they send me running through my house to get to locked room. Over time it has gotten much better but every time I hear the news of the recent tragedy in Connecticut my mind gets flooded with horrific images which bring tears to my eyes. 

Last Friday I was walking to a store which was right next to the store where Jenna was murdered and tears just started coming down my face. I think I should talk about this but at the same time I don't want to move past it because these children and other people who have been senselessly murdered like this deserve for us to know the truth about their end no matter how horrifying it is for us, it was worse for them. So I don't want to get over it, I don't want to forget it. I keep remember her mother and father sitting in the courtroom with the stoic dignity I would hope I could muster. 

I just wanted to share because the last few days have been very tough. I just wish we didn't have to live with these images in our minds and I wish more people didn't have to meet their end like this.

I also feel very thankful that there are so many people that are willing to spend their entire lives discovering the truth about these crimes. Dealing with the gruesome crime scenes and reviewing the evidence. I used to think of prosecutors as just people that put drug dealers in jail and harassed marijuana smokers but I realize now there is a very dark disturbing side to their jobs. I greatly appreciate that they have taken upon their souls the job of seeking justice for the victims day in and day out. I can't imagine how disturbed their souls must be. I wish I could give them comfort. Anyway, just sharing. Please don't murder people, it sucks.",,False,,t5_2qho7,1355803117.0,,,True,t3_151813,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/151813/this_is_purely_theraputic_for_me_i_just_need_to/,

1354591877.0,5,self.selfhelp,148pyn,Lost.,5,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/148pyn/lost/,"Hello, Im pretty new here, and I guess ill start of with the main reason for this post.
I feel Lost (But it may be loneliness), Its been this way ever since elementary/high school  (im 21 now, still living with my family) I was never one of the guys who would be ""social"" and in turn my grades suffered. Luckily, I was able to scrape by to graduation and get into a photography school right out of high school. Things were looking up. I got a amazing camera, discovered how artistic and creative I was and was having a great time. However, I always knew that there wasnt that much suppourt (or would it even be company, friends? Just anyone to back me up) throughout my daily life, Family is helpful but I came from a family of engineers, nurses and sailors. so not much in the lines of creativity and photograhpic suppourt. I wasnt able to make that many friends (i assume it was because of my reclusive attitude i built back in school) in the photography school. however I had made a promise to myself that my grades wouldnt drop as hard as I'd done back in highshool, and it turned out that they became better, but It never felt like there was suppourt backing me, just blind ambition throwing me forward.

Fast forward to the end of photo-school (2010), my portfolio is finished and the optimisim is as high as ever, I send it out to all the agencys, magazines, companys, etc and hear a little word back and start working my way as a professional photographer. but all this time, I know im making contacts, short-term friends, and meeting new people, but the fear and the feeling of being empty/lonely is still there. 

Skipping ahead some more, to summer 2012. I've been noticing that my shoots and jobs are demishing, so i start looking into new markets to do photos for. unfortunatley I get little to no response. again, reaccuring feelings of lonliness and fear of not being sceen.

Come October 2012, all but a few photo-jobs have dried up, and im starting to freak out seeing as i soon wont be able to pay for my truck's insurance, so i start looking to new areas of where i can work, construction, nautical, engineering, welding (pretty much most trades)
luckily i get on the wait list for Welding at my local college (stars january 2013) and a spark of optimisim pops up again.


Next comes late october, Im doing a timelape shoot and my camera that i've been using to capture all the sights, scenes, sounds, and memories. breaks. the shutter is no longer working and I start freaking out, what happens next, is this the end of my photography career? do i just stop what im doing and go into a completley diffferent direction? all sorts of questions begin racing through my head and i lose it. I begin going on long road trips, out to the wilderness, discovering new places, sights, sounds. but even now i can barely remember what i have seen. the all-too-familar *click* of my shutter still rings in my mind, but it is nowhere to be found.

Its December now. I've been applying to all sorts of jobs (warehouse, driver, stocking, dishwasher, carwasher, etc) and to no success of accquireing work. I've been living off my last few dollars, my daily tools: phone, watch, clothes, hair, attitude, are falling apart. I see these things crack and rip all around me and i can do nothing to fix these. I've started swimming in a futile attempt to ease the stress and depression i've been having and its been very good on my body. aside from the constant buying of candies (the chewing helps calm me down for some odd reason) 


This was a quick story of my life up to this point, I still dont know why I wrote it all up. Im feeling lost right now, I go throughout my day looking for jobs, anywhere that I think I could fit in. One day i could be hard-set on being a carpenter, the next i could be determined to work as a deckhand on a small sailing vessel. 

I feel lost. Lost in the world and with little sense of purpose.

For instance, when I was in fourth grade I would touch a small metal rod sticking out of the sidewalk whilst waiting for my school bus, otherwise I would get bad grades or negative comments from my teachers.

Over the years the rituals have gotten more extreme. Nowadays, while walking, I have to stop my music at a precise part of a specific song and stare at least four consecutive green traffic lights. I feel as if I ignore my urge to conduct these rituals, my family members or friends would get hurt.

A few months ago, I stopped doing these rituals for a few days. I convinced myself that this behavior was extremely irrational and simply CRAZY. However, within a few days I had an extremely stressful week which led me to believe that these rituals have some sort of an effect upon my life. I resumed with the rituals, and added a few extra ones to my ""routine"".

Is there anything you guys can suggest? Any readings that I can do?
I've never told anyone about this before.. Or visited a doctor..

Reward feelings for accomplishments can also be very weak. For example, this summer I lost weight and I could comfortably wear old shorts which were much too tight for many years. That didn't feel like a big successful accomplishment. Instead, it felt more like an interesting novelty, like ""hey, cool"".  I also found I could run without it quickly becoming painful and out of breath exertion. That was also seen like an interesting novelty. In terms of reward, eating delicious food is probably more rewarding.

For the most part, I've only felt strong motivation to do new things while I was on drugs. It seemed to me like that's how I ought to be feeling all the time. For a long time, I thought I could somehow transfer the enthusiasm from the drug state to sober states, but it doesn't work that way. I rarely do drugs nowadays.

I was sitting lifting (it's 1:30 pm here) and a lady came to the door saw me and turned around, didn't even come in.
Obviously I feel a little shitty because I don't know what I did and I wouldn't care at all, **but this has happened before**.
I was lifting a girl came in and lifted as well i swear I did nothing abnormal at all, I lifted and left.
Well the same girl works at the subway next door, and I always grab a sandwich after my noon lifting, now she said she remembered seeing me and said we made a little small talk about working out and I ended with ""well I'll probably see you around."" have her a smile and a nod and left.
Now a couple times when I lift at night like I normally do she waits in her car until I leave to come in.
I really don't have any clue what the fuck I'm doing to be so off putting (I'm nice but not in weird overly personal way) but I need some damn help

In addition to this- I only consume a max of 1200 calories a day. To do this, I eat nothing until dinner time- usually between 4 and 6 PM. This way, I can have what I want, and a large filling meal, like I used to- 4 times a day. 
I am a woman, 25 years old 5'6"" and currently 284. 
I began this regimen 5 days ago. I plan on adding one hour of walking/jogging to the mix tonight.

If this ISN'T something most people get (As I suspect might be the case) Does anyone have any ideas what might be causing this? It's bugged me for years. If relevant, i'm very prone to getting songs, quotes or noises repeated in my head for days on end too.

I had a messed up life. Now I'm 18 out of high school with a very loving boyfriend who I have been with for 3 years. The effects of the life I have had before are horrible. I'm unmotivated depressed and have severe anxiety. I can't break it. I want to get my license but I'm to scared, I want to go to nursing school but feel I can't handle it. I want to get a job but it's impossible for me to keep it together for interview. My boyfriend and I will be moving in the next week or two because we had to sell my childhood home do to not being able to afford it. I can't function on a daily basis. I really don't know where I am going with this. I feel like I'm not a normal person. People think I'm this nice well off girl who has a bright future but in reality I'm fighting a war with myself that I am slowly losing. I don't know what to do anymore I'm lost And hurting. I don't want to be on meds I've tried many before and I really don't want to get into that. I'm in therapy but it seems to just make everything worse. I can't put a burden on my boyfriend but I can't support myself in my situation. Ive been neglected and abused was never taught how to do anything I have had to learn everything on my own including personal hygiene, how to try my shoes, how to cook for myself and many more things. I didn't brush my teeth until I was 14 years old because no one cared enough to sit down and say look you need to brush your teeth everyday. I struggle and have to force myself to do everything or I will never get it done. When I had homework for school no one would help me so I struggled and finally when I got into high school i started going to a school where they would help me. I just want to feel and be a normal person who can handle their own life without having to struggle with inner demons. I guess this is more of a rant than a question. I just really needed to get this out. It will probably be
