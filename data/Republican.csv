Every single thing that gets posted gets downvoted severely by liberals, including the comments within. This is the REPUBLICAN subreddit. If you are a liberal and you are in here - you are going to agree with NOTHING.

I have NEVER been to the /r/liberal subreddit - because I know there is very little that I will agree with there, and I have enough respect for differing opinions to leave them alone on their own subreddit.

The ENTIRE /r/Politics subreddit is completely overrun by liberal Bias. Maybe if /r/politics wasn't a liberal circle-jerk, liberals could argue in the general politics section and would not have to come to /r/republican to find things to disagree with.

I would imagine that the number of republicans on Reddit is dropping by the day as a result of every subreddit being overrun with liberal downvotes. It's a sad day when they hive mind of Reddit drives away all voices of opposition.

Liberals - is this what you want? You want all of reddit to be /r/circlejerk for your political views?

Republicans - share with us some sites where you go to have intelligent political conversation that is not overrun by sneering, runny nose liberals that only want to squelch opposition through power in numbers and not through actual debate.

If you are a republican reading the comments, you'll probably have to click the plus signs next to them, as the liberals in here are downvoting our republican ideas and opinions below the comment threshold in every thread.

:::: Edit to point out that I've received so many liberal downvotes while only posting in /r/republican that I have restrictions on my commenting now. It makes me wait 10+ minutes to make a COMMENT now :::::

Brace yourselves for downvotes now that this is at the top of the /r/republican front page. It was fun while it lasted.

THAT'S who Mitt Romney is. He's not a red-faced flip-flopper that speaks in monotone and touts his wife like a campaign poster, yet for some reason that's what the Republican Party changed him into.

The GOP tried to mold him into some kind of weird interdimensional ball of clay that conservatives, moderates, AND independents would vote for. This was the GOP's undoing this election cycle. 

Had they let Mitt Romney just be himself, that is to say had they let the ""concession speech Romney"" run for president rather than the dilapidated husk of a man they created, the GOP would have likely run away with this election.

Moral of the story: the problem had nothing to do with the candidate Republicans nominated. The problem was what they *did* with that candidate.

Its safe to say that Republicans wont be winning any more elections until a huge change is implemented into the platform. It appears to be the consensus so far, from what i can see, even amongst some of the most hardcore republicans i know. Its going to be just about impossible to pivot from the far right in the primaries to the center in the election and win.

That being said, it's really looking like the right is going to split into two separate factions: The hardcore conservatives that entrench themselves farther to the right, and the moderates that want to take a step to the left. 

This is for the moderate Republicans: Figuratively speaking, scream as loud as you can, right now!!!! Take your party back, and hustle!!! If you don't, the more extreme elements of your party will, and they will define the next 4 years of conservative politics. At that point, with a potentially more extreme platform, or even the same one you have now, you will be 4 more years behind the curve in the demographics game, essentially giving democrats a chance to solidify the minority vote for at least the next generation. The implications of this are much greater than the next election, and i urge you not to listen to anyone who says that the reason Romney lost was because he was not conservative enough. Socially moderate and fiscally conservative is the recipe, and i guarantee you will win.


EDIT: It would be extremely beneficial if, after this whole fiscal cliff thing, the GOP turned directly to dealing with immigration reform. Something that granted a pathway to citizenship. Something that they could put their names on and force the president in a position to either accept or reject their position. It would be good politics, and it would draw in more latino's (who made the difference this time around).

Also, give up on gay marriage and reductions to federal student loan programs.

In fact, I think I see more posts with a right-wing view receive downvotes here than in r/politics. This is not the way a right-wing subreddit should work.

Why is this? Isn't this supposed to be a right-wing subreddit? If so, why are right-wing views and jokes (other than memes) constantly getting downvoted and attacked. Not debated, attacked. There are times I have to check if I'm in r/politics, r/democrat, or r/republican. I'm all for a healthy debate, but it can't happen until right-wing viewpoints stop getting negative votes. 

So as a plea to all of my fellow r/republican redditors: If you don't agree with something, whatever it may be, don't downvote it just because it's contrary to your opinion. 

Downvotes should be reserved for comments that are purely vitriolic, or truly add nothing to the conversation. Offended by a political joke in a thread that started from a meme? Leave it be. This is a repulican subreddit, we will make jokes about democrats. Does someone have a different viewpoint? As long as the post is well thought out and maturely debated, leave it be, or preferably, upvote it, especially if you have a good argument the other way. Someone attacks another and says they're stupid, classless, uninformed, or an asshole? Downvote them all you want. 

**TL;DR: If you're downvoting based on opinion, do yourself and your blood pressure a favour and unsubscribe. This subreddit will always lean right. That's the point of it. If you oppose the view but want a thoughtful debate, feel free to stay, but know you're the minority.**",,False,self,t5_2qndt,False,,,True,t3_vsj0v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/vsj0v/what_has_happened_to_rrepublican/,

""I'd give food and houses to all the homeless people."" Her parents beamed with pride! ""Wow...what a worthy goal!"" I said. ""But you don't have to wait until you're President to do that!""

Then you can go over to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out and give him the $50 to use toward food and a new house.""

Allow me to formally introduce myself. I am Susan Davis, and I want to be your next Congresswoman. Let me tell you why. I believe as our Founding Fathers believed that the House was a place for citizens to go for a couple of terms to affect some good and return to their normal lives, not become career politicians. I also am a very firm believer in the U.S. Constitution as it was envisioned, a limited Federal Government and Strong States Rights. We need to reform education in this country, we need to take control of education from the Federal Government and return it to the States. We need to overhaul health care in this country, and that does not include the Affordable Care Act, which is anything but affordable. We need to rethink Federal Cancer research to benefit those who will most benefit from it. We must stop paying foreign countries to be our allies, and instead use that money to pay down our national debt.

We must get the Federal Government to live up to the First Amendment of the Constitution and recognize the Establishment Clause; thereby getting the government out of the business of marriage. We have tried the route of Federal Law, which I believe to be Unconstitutional, and I await the Supreme Court’s ruling as to such. Instead I would rather the issue be handled by the States under their power under the 10th Amendment. Without the Federal Government describing marriage the true Faith and Credit Clause would no longer apply. We must apply the best of our generation to give to the generation that comes after us a better country, not a county mired in partisan fighting and fractured beliefs. We must, and we can do better to advance the American ideal; the ideal of a better tomorrow. We owe this to our children, we owe this to all children. I hope you join me in this belief. You can connect with me at www.susandavisforgeorgia.com

Update: I will get to all your questions, I did have to take a break last night. I currently home school my daughter, so responses today will come slowly but I will get to you all as soon as I can. Thank you so much for all of your questions and comments.

No longer. I am sick and tired of electing people based on fiscal policies only to have them take office and start working on nothing but social policies. 

Abortion: Give it up. The Supreme Court ruled. Listen to Boortz. This fight is over. Besides, pregnancy is not binary. 1 day old cellular blobs are not ""life"" any more than 9th month fetuses are not. Somewhere in the middle is where the truth lies, but the assholes at Republican HQ just keep pushing the absolutist abortion = murder position that almost no american agrees with other than hard right fundamentalists.

Ten Commandments/Prayer In Schools = again, give it up. The Supreme Court has ruled. Yes, it is wrong when it is OK to be a Muslim or Jew at work or on public property and not a Christian. Yes, it is wrong when people try to silence all religious expression just because they don't like it. No, that does not mean our nation was founded on Christian principles. Deists were not Christians. The 18th Century was not a period in which religion was all the rage. The Ten Commandments are not the foundation of American law. Only the lines about adultery, stealing, and killing relate even a little. 

Where Obama was born = give it up. He has already served 3/4 of a term. This argument is already over. 

Gay Marriage = I am married and straight. Why do I care if gay people get married? Did I somehow join some company with a logo that says ""Married People of the World"" who's trademark will be sullied if gay people marry? I don't give a shit about this issue. Let them marry or don't, just STFU and fix the damn budget already.

Stop the freaking bible thumping religious bullshit and address spending. That is the only reason I ever voted republican. I want to keep my money. I want people who suck at working and studying in school to get their justice and live poor lives without me being robbed to give them cable TV and beer. I'm tired of being shaken upside down by liberals who's fundamental policies I agree with but who feel the best way to make their guilt over the suffering of others go away is to take my money and give it to someone else, or increase taxes.

Increasing taxes is stupid. Why would we give even MORE money to the government when it has utterly failed to manage the money we already gave them? 

Where is the party that represents my financial interests, simplifies and lowers my taxes, and shuts the hell up about Terry Schiavo and whatever other furor about religion comes up? Every time you guys get elected, you screw EVERYTHING up and work on all the wrong things. BTW, I am not voting for that moron Palin nor Gingrich. Not Trump either. Find someone who is actually better than Obama, please. If there isn't anyone, it is because the fiscal conservatives have abandoned you.

There. I said it.

There were claims that Obama has Martial Law ready to go (and several other absolutely nuts conspiracy theories), and that Obama doesn't have a birth certificate (specifically called an idiot and a fraud). 
Guys, when we as republicans resort to this kind of name calling, accusations, and other wack-job theories, we are lowering ourselves to the same level as the left on MSNBC, and I now understand the unfortunate reputation that conservatives have in the liberal media. I don't agree with Obama either, he is a liberal who is moving our country farther down the path to socialism, but we need to compose ourselves and focus on the issues. When we start name calling and shouting accusations, we, at that point, have already lost the argument. 
We need to get back to the small-government and fiscal responsibility values that were established in our party's platform, and use those values to logically ""convert"" people to the conservative side of politics.

Edit: spelling

Edit: I would like to apologize for calling those on MSNBC ""left-wing nutjobs"", it was completely irresponsible. I disagree with those on that channel even more than I disagree with Nancy Pelosi (which is saying something) and I returned their name calling with more name calling. 
I also added the word ""farther"" to ""down the path to socialism"" because I don't think it is entirely the left's fault that the US has adapted some socialist principles.

--- **Recapture the moral high ground.** The Republican party used to _stand_ for something, but now they have lost credibility on their own issues. Imagine if rank-and-file Democrats honestly believed that the Democratic party had lost all credibility on gay rights, social welfare, gun control, abortion, etc (their own top issues.) What would happen to the Democratic party, in such circumstances? The same is true with the Republicans and their issues:

* Republicans used to stand for **tax reform** and **financial liberty.** But now they are the party of the Federal Reserve, and _""a few percent here, close a loophole there.""_ It's not enough. This is the Internet age. GWB's tax reform committee got us nowhere; they rejected the FairTax out of hand. The new proposed committee on a ""gold standard"" is also a crock and will also get us nowhere. It's insulting. **The Republicans need to clearly identify the current tax system as immoral and broken,** and not worthy of being patched. It's a moral issue. **All tax talk needs to center around real, fundamental reform.** (An accountant -- a _democrat_ -- told me, last year: _""The current tax code is like a giant pile of horse shit, and they just keep putting whipped cream on top of it. What they need to do is throw the whole thing out and start fresh. But not yet -- wait a few more years until I retire."")_

* Republicans used to stand for **strong national defense,** while Democrats were weak and naive. (Remember the ridiculous Michael Dukakis tank commercial?) But this position becomes a lot harder to defend when we are invading nations, and when we have 900 bases in 130 countries. Enough! Stop closing bases in the USA -- close the overseas bases instead. (At least close half of them.) _Certainly_ close the bases in Europe! Make those welfare-addicted socialists pay for their own defense. Bring our troops home, and let's stimulate local economies with local bases instead. Stop the invasions, and remember the bald eagle with the arrows and the olive branch. Say to the world: **We're going home. America will no longer attack any nations unless our national defense is threatened.** (And woe to those who attack us, for they will awaken a sleeping giant.)

* Republicans used to stand for **limited government.** Turn every issue into a State's Rights issue. Appeal to the Constitution. Any power not explicitly enumerated to the Federal government is reserved to the States and the People. Stop debating legislation based on its merits, and instead ask whether it's even within the proper scope of the Federal government. Pledge to spend an entire term of Congress proposing no new legislation at all, but rather in working to repeal legislation and to dismantle antiquated, redundant, or overreaching agencies. Appeal to Thomas Jefferson and use his quotes whenever a debate comes up.


--- Go after traditionally Democratic constituencies, _but do not pander to their weaknesses as the Democrats do._ Appeal to the moral high ground. For example:

* **Blacks.** Many in the Republican party seem to believe that blacks are a lost cause (not worth campaigning to.) This is a mistake, and also an insult to their intelligence. There are certain Republican stances that appeal greatly to the black community. For example, be up-front with them that the current, socialist educational system is the modern equivalent of forbidding slaves to read. (The elite must keep us dumbed-down in order to rule over us.) Condemn the public system on moral grounds and make a real push for educational reform. (Such as ending all Federal educational controls, giving all the power to the states, and letting them experiment with statewide voucher systems, etc.) Anything is better than the failed, broken system we have now. Give people freedom of choice in education and make it clear that parents, not bureaucrats, have a sovereign right over the education of their own children.

* **The poor.** Poor people do not actually want social welfare programs, per se. Rather, they want food and electricity, and a place to sleep, and the opportunity to better their lives and the lives of their children. Consider for a moment the FairTax. This revenue-neutral proposal is quite simple: eliminate ALL Federal taxes, then replace them with a single retail sales tax of 23%, and then send a monthly reimbursement cheque to all households covering the amount of tax normally paid up to the poverty line. For example, poverty in 2011 for a family with three children, is defined as $26,844.  Assuming the total amount is spent on living expenses each year, this means the family pays $6,174 each year in sales taxes. So divide that by 12, and send them a cheque for $514 every single month (this amount will entirely cover their rent.) **Imagine being able to steal the Democrats' thunder by sending $500 per month to every household, while simultaneously eliminating other welfare programs AND reforming the tax system, all in one fell swoop.** On top of that, this tax system removes burdens from American companies competing overseas, while simultaneously forcing foreign nations to pay American taxes for any goods they sell into our market.

* **Women.** It's a known fact that married women vote Republican, while single women vote Democrat. How on earth did Democrats ever convince single women that a Republican aversion to paying for their abortions and birth control, somehow equates to a ""war on women"" ? The answer is, because stupid Republicans keep getting caught saying the word ""rape."" SHUT UP! If a reporter asks you, _""Should abortion be illegal even in the case of rape or incest?""_ The proper answer is not, _""God meant for you to get raped, God works in mysterious ways.""_ Wrong wrong wrong! The proper answer is, _""Of course not. Think about all the millions of helpless, innocent babies that would still be alive today if those horrible circumstances really were the only legitimate justification for abortion. Nevertheless, this is a states' rights issue, and the Federal government has no place cramming the murder of babies down the throats of good, Christian people like the citizens of Kansas.""_ Similarly, if a college student ridiculously demands for other people to pay for her birth control, the proper response is not, _""Slut!""_ Wrong wrong wrong! The proper answer is, _""I fully support your right to use and pay for your own birth control.""_

* **Hispanics.** Hispanics are good, hardworking, family-oriented people. How on earth did they end up voting for Democrats? The answer: Because they are scared shitless of being deported and having their lives uprooted. Can you blame them? It's a little-known fact that the Republican party rammed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 down Lyndon B. Johnson's throat, after Democrats had been the party of the Ku Klux Klan for decades. But LBJ, sensing that change was in the air, took credit for the act and used it as an opportunity to hijack the black community into the Democratic fold. LBJ famously said, _“I'll have those niggers voting Democratic for the next 200 years.”_ So… now that the southern border is well-protected (by drones) it's time to make a decision about the people who are already here, and let them live in peace. Republicans should become their champions, and push for an immigration reform bill that gives them peace, while simultaneously locking in priorities such as border control, deportation of criminals, voter ID, and perhaps even a ten-year immigration moratorium. Lock in the Hispanic vote. They are hard-working--appeal to them by protecting their status and the fruit of their labor.


--- **Unify the Liberty movement with the Christian base.** Does anyone else notice how disrespectfully the mainline Republican party treats Ron Paul and the Liberty movement? And does anyone notice how disrespectfully the Liberty movement speaks of the Christian right? It's a shame because these groups would make natural allies. In fact, it's Christianity that inspired liberty in the first place. Even Thomas Jefferson, the ""Apostle of Liberty"" and a Deist, wrote that Jesus Christ had devised the highest system of morals the world had ever seen. A few of Ron Paul's positions need to be taken seriously and adopted by the Republican party, if they don't wish to slip into obscurity. For example:

* **End the Fed.** This is the Internet age, and it's no longer fringe to recognize the monetary fascism perverting the flow of our economy. Eliminate legal tender laws, and champion the right of the people to use any currency they wish. Not even a gold standard is good enough -- there must be complete and total freedom in money. Only the invisible hand of the market should decide our standards, not a centralized, authoritarian cartel.

* **End the Patriot Act.** It totally destroys any credibility the Republicans had on the issue of Freedom. Get rid of it.

* Make a push for **fair representation,** which is the real reason that unions and corporations are over-represented in our government. See: http://apportionment.us

* **Stop meddling with Israel.** We get hit with tornados and hurricanes every time we try. Get entirely out of Israel's way and set them free to deal with their neighbors in whatever way they see fit, so that they will have the leverage to start getting treaties into place. They will never be able to do this as long as we are pressuring them to divide their land. It's none of our business, and many people in this country see our actions as an affront to God. For example: _""[God] sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that touches you touches the apple of his eye.""_ As well as: _""There I will judge them for harming my people, my special possession, for scattering my people among the nations, and for dividing my land.""_

* **Eliminate foreign aid.** At the very least, eliminate foreign aid to dictators. (Attach moral standards to any aid.)

* Liberty advocates and Christians actually have quite a bit in common. The way to win over Christians is not to force baby-murder down their throats. Rather, unify with them that abortion should be a States' rights issue. All members of the Republican party, including fans of **Ayn Rand,** can get behind Scriptures such as these:

--Edit: Just wanted to make it clear that the purpose of these Scriptures is not to convince Liberty advocates to be more Christian. **Rather, the purpose is to convince the Christian wing of the Republican party to join with the Liberty movement.** (You see, Scriptures are influential to _Christians._ )

&gt;I'm actually a little glad some people in this thread are let down. Maybe now we can grow up a little and realize that because someone holds some of the same political views as you, doesn't make them open minded or honest.

&gt;She's dodged the most important questions, and left in the blink of an eye.

&gt;**Edit** Let me just add quick the mentality she had coming into this thing...she, like many other journalists and politicians alike expected it to be an advertisement, not an honest debate. This is what discourse in America has become...where even a supposed journalist, is surprised at being asked tough questions.

&gt;Quite frankly, if Obama and the left wing media is the best progressive ideals has to offer, if this is all we have to counter the conservatives, the country will slip further, and fuhrer to the right.

I stand before you as a voter who has voted mostly DFL / Independent for the last two elections, in spite of some of my more conservative views. This is a testament to how the party can win my vote. 

First off,  I am staunchly for State's rights, certainly my most Conservative stance. Secondly, I am for fiscal conservatism at both state and federal levels. Out of control spending, debt riding, and bailouts must be checked, and the fiscal conservatism of the old Republican party can help us get out of that hole. Finally, I am for a scaled back federal government (minus the judicial system) that ties to the first point of giving states more power over their governments. 

That is all well and good, but there is currently absolutely no way I can back the GOP. I am young, as many of you are, and there is no place in my conscious for many of the other platforms the GOP has taken. If the GOP is about personal freedom, then tryout religion out of my government. I don't mean to say people shouldn't be guided by their personal views, this is inevitable, but drop the reliance on Jesus and the Christian demagoguery. There is a real conversation to be had about abortion, that doesn't include simple write-offs due to your religious views. It is not black and white, and anybody that has actually looked at the issue should know this. Next, screw your old white boys club. You stink of prejudice and look pathetic while hanging on to your old world views the rest of us are leaving behind. Get over it. Plain and simple. Nothing the GOP has said about marriage has been backed by ANY scientific evidence. Shows me a group of peer reviewed studies that suggest gay couples can't raise a family. And don't belittle me with the biological argument, it's 2012 people. There are many other ways to raise a family. Which brings me to my next point, science. Do I need to say more?  Creationism? REALLY? Also, climate change is real and affecting us, stop blindly spewing out the same vacuous bullshit, that has NO basis in the modern, scientific world. 

TL;DR: Drop the social bullshit, embrace science, and get back to your fiscal conservative roots, and you may win my (and many others) votes. ",,False,self,t5_2qndt,False,,,True,t3_12svp6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/12svp6/what_the_republican_party_can_do_to_win_my_future/,

I contacted my church, which is where I am suppose to vote.  They told me that its moved to a elementary school, but he doesnt know when it would start.  

So I contacted the school and they said that it starts at 5:00 and lasts until 9:00.

So I arrived there to find out that the doors were locked and no body was around.  I tried calling the school again, listening to a voice machine. 

I contacted the church again and they said that there isn't any voting today.

According to several websites, the church is suppose to be the location of where I need to vote based on my area.


I'm unable to contact the office in Iowa for voter fraud because its completely closed down.  I wanted to vote for a candidate and I'm not able to because of these assholes!  Who the hell can I contact to have this resolved?

Edit.  I contacted the Ron Paul office to see if it was going on and they said it is.  It turns out that I'm not the only having this problem and that there were 6 calls about this problem.

Edit 2: I managed to talk two a couple of different numbers and they said to check it out again.  I did, but the door knobs wouldn't turn.  I watched a couple of people enter a hidden door area and went down a long hallway.  I managed to find the voting room.  There was no sign or mentioning of which door to use.  There is still some people who are calling into this probleming through the Ron Paul office.

Edit 3:  One of the phone numbers that I contacted shortly before I visited the place the second time didn't really help me.  Apparently the person on the phone was giving me caucus location in a completely different city and was arguing with me.  When the guy finally figured out where I was at, he said he's looking into where my precinct is at.  A few seconds later, he hangs up the phone, never calling me back.  I called the Ron Paul office again and told them about it.  The lady on the line said the guy was probably an asshole and sometimes they don't know what the hell they are talking about.  She was kind enough to help me in contacting a different number.",,False,self,t5_2qndt,True,,,True,t3_o1rpc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/o1rpc/i_live_in_iowa_and_there_may_be_some_voterrelated/,

That said, I do think you guys have good ideas that should be taken into account to help the country.  It's clear that something needs to change, and I think working together is the only way to do it.

EXAMPLE: I agree with the IDEA that taxing businesses while also making it viable for small businesses to compete in the market, thus leading to economic growth and a competitive market for the American people, is sound.  That said I also think that for that situation to occur, I think that Government does need to step in and help get these budding businesses off of the ground, or else they won't survive against the larger companies in terms of resources for promotion and distribution.  Should it be a matter of any moron taking their idea to the Government and being like ""GIMMIE A BUSINESS YO!""?  No.

Hi guys.

So it's come to my attention that I actually have no idea what the Republican Party is supposed to be about.  It clicked recently that I'm doing the exact same thing people in my party blame Republicans for...listening only to my ""side"" and not getting both sides of the argument.  And I know exactly WHY I do this, by the way.  Let me enlighten you.

1. I was raised in a Democratic house.  This included my mother (recently divorced from my father, registered Independent, pretty Left), my grandparents on my mother's side (both Democratic), my aunt (Democratic), and her boyfriend (I have no clue).

Given the typical viewpoint of my party, my grandparents should have been Republicans.  They were White, solidly Middle Class, Suburban, and grew up in the 1950s.  My Grandfather was apparently raised Catholic, but I never had a religion pushed on me as a child (my parents thought it would be wrong).  But they weren't.  The reason I'm telling you this is so you know MY background.  I'm white, male, solidly Middle Class, grew up in mostly cohesive family, etc.  Now you have my American credentials.

Because of my Democratic background I've never questioned that it was MY party.  Hell, I barely know what my state representatives stand for.  They're blue, I vote for 'em.  And that's wrong.

So in the interested of becoming a more informed, better human being able to reliably serve and shape my country for the better, I ask you all.  What in the hell does your party stand for?  Here's what I THINK I know.

I think you have a sub-party that basically stands for Biblical law (or their interpretation of it) but they're REALLY loud and Religion in general isn't my thing.  I looked into a bunch of religions, they just don't fit.  I also think you have a dying group focused more on minimizing the role of the government in the lives of Americans while trying to to create growth by relying on people to sort out the economy on their own.  Finally, both of those groups seem to be dominated by a group of older men and women (mostly men, mostly white) who appear unwilling or unable to adapt to the world around them.

Before someone says to go to Wikipedia or something, that defeats the point.  I'm here to ask Republicans about their party and to get a human opinion, not read what some random person slapped onto a website.

His inability to articulate what was wrong with the Obama ""Not-War"" policy in Libya was obvious. The moment he was shocked that Obama said ""Check the transcripts"" instead of retorting ""I memorized that speech, Mr. President as preparation for this debate. You said the word ""Terror"" but you did not call the attack in Benghazi an act of terror. The same way you insisted we couldn't call our involvement in Libya ""War"". His hyper insistence that he wanted ""peace, peace, PEACE!"" (It was over-the-top desperate.) instead of explaining to america that the lack of responsibility in the reconstruction of Libya, and the lack of continuity in policy in Syria were the issues and differences between the campaigns.

First of all, I am european, to be specific austrian (no not Australia, Austria, it`s a german speking country next to germany) and I, as of recently try to understand the differences between the European and US American culture. 

Specifically I am interested in all the differences in thinking, from patriotism to religion and of course social security and healthcare.
I follow US News reports pretty closely and also, since discovering reddit the democratic and republican topics and what I have found in regards to healthcare gives me reason to be concerned. It seems to me that public healthcare in the US is grossly misrepresented on the side of the republicans and I honestly don`t get why. I have read topics where such concerns prop up like that if the government takes over healthcare that people will die in the emergency room, that the government will pick your doctors and that all in all the whole deal will mutate into a lumbering buerocratic maschiene instead of a live saving institution. 
These concerns where raised on reddit in a previous post about the issue. The poster made a comperision to the Canadian public healthcare system. Althou immidiatly after this kind of posts a few Canadians showed up and refuted each and every one of these concernes nobody seemed to even care what they had to say. From my own experience with the Austrian public healthcare system I have to tell you that such concernes are blatantly fabricated lies. I never ever even heard of such things and I should because my mother was a nurse in the emergency tract of our hospital, as is my sister. 

Also I am close friends with many germans, who have a similar public health care system, as have friends and acquaintances from Great Britain, the Netherlands and Dutch and not a single one of them ever lost a bad word about their system. Don`t get me wrong, of course it is not 100% perfect, but then again, no system is. 

I think my real question is, what do you, as republicans, make of this? Do you honestly think that our system is that bad?  I mean, in light of this, shouldn’t it be obvious that these fears have no basis in reality? Or do you maybe think that your government wouldn’t implement the neccecary  changes  to your system adequately enough? Or is it something else entirely? I heard the argument that some, or many people in the republican party don’t want to pay for other peoples health, that they see public health care as some kind of charity or as a kind of infringement on their personal freedom to choose to give to others. But, isn’t that a very selfisch argument? I mean, yeah, you give some of your money away for others, but the other people also do that for you. It is a kind of everyone wins scenario.

Ok, I think the article came throu way more preachy than I intended. If that is the case I am sorry, it was not my intention. I just wanted to take away the prejudices that seem to exist about public healthcare  and I want to know what your thoughts are on this matter. Please share your  insight with me, I`m sure there are many arguments that I am not aware of as a non US citizen. It just seems odd to me that a system in which I grew up in and which never gave me any concern is so demonized in another country.

Also, sorry if this is not the right category for this topic but I specifically wanted to hear the opinions of the republican party and my language, as english is not my mothers tongue. But above else, I thank you for taking the time to read this article and hope we can share our opinions :)",,False,self,t5_2qndt,False,,,True,t3_14dtys,http://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/14dtys/a_european_wonders_about_the_way_republicans_see/,
1352273197.0,45,self.Republican,12sbiz,How to win 2016,94,49,177,http://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/12sbiz/how_to_win_2016/,"Alright, so I know many of you are in shock and reeling over the re-election of Barack Obama. Yet in 2016, you guys will once again have your shot at the White House.  The following is how I think you could get a GOP leader back into the White House come 2016: 


Mitt Romney tried to be Bush 2.0, he tried to be another neo-con corporate candidate and it failed. You need to rethink and recalibrate your party. 

First of all,  you need to have a candidate with convictions. Put forth a candidate who states his positions and then sticks by them. Romney's flip-flops were unforgivable and his plan to reveal his tax plan after election was irresponsible and flawed.  You need to have someone who is well spoken, successful, yet still personal. Obama exudes personality while Romney was a wet noodle of social awkwardness. The prime presidential candidate should be a man who we would respect among world leaders, not someone who looks like they're two sentences away from a cultural gaffe. This candidate should also seem privy to sitting down and having a beer with the average American. And no, quoting a thirteen year old song while awkwardly surrounded by black people is not connecting to America, it's just being awkward. 

Secondly,  there are certain things that a candidate must concede. The first is that abortion is here to stay. Roe v Wade will not be overturned and the only thing it will do is alienate voters and make your party seem misogynistic. The second is that gay marriage and gay rights will happen. Take it out of the equation.  You loose the moderates who are fiscally conservative but socially liberal and the independents who may feel the same way. 

Rather focus on the most important issues, like taxes, responsible spending, and limited government. You can't claim you want to limit government, then push for a constitutional ban on gay marriage. Nor can you claim it, when you then in the same breathe say the government should take away the right to choose. People will see through your ruse.  Again, this is concessions. What's more important, that Todd and Mark don't get married or Brenda doesn't get that abortion, or that you're able to not be taxed out of your home? Let's be real, one directly effects you a lot more.

 I came to the conclusion that it might be because people were finally able to see Romney through unbiased eyes.

Thoughts?




**Republican here:** To speak frankly the GOP is at war with itself. Right now there are two sides of our party. There are more the more traditional to what we might now call progressive conservatives who are essentially purely fiscally minded, and then we have the new social conservative movement.

The new social conservative movement is very interesting. These are your bible thumpers, your Rick Santorum's, Mike Huckabee's and Jerry Falwell's. These are the guys who decided that the neo-cons didnt take it far enough and that we really needed to ram home the fact that the government should help dictate your social life. (fuck that.) Now I saw this is a new movement because if you look at history this is not the way the republican party has traditionally acted. To contextualize, if you look at the neo-con movement championed by Barry Goldwater in '64, those guys look liberal compared to Santorum. Essentially whats gone on in my opinion is that these new social conservatives have found a way to tie their message in with the evangelical message which such a great deal of our nation lives by in order to gain footing with in the Republican party.

Now on the other hand you have your traditional Republicans who we must now label as progressive conservatives. These are your fiscal conservatives. Your Jon Huntsmans, Ronald Regans, Ross Perots, and Mitt Romney before he became a mega-technocrat. These are the guys who essentially see capitalism as a pyramid, like the system and want to work with it. I understand a lot of you reading might disagree, but this is the group who champion the growth of the middle and elevation of the upper-class'. These are the guys who your parents or grandparents voted for during the civil rights movement. They would like to focus on fiscal and foreign policy but over the past 50 years have slowly had to change their message to accommodate the growing voice of evangelical voters.

**Heres an example:** Take a look at Mitt Romney when he ran for Senate in MA in 1994. MA is progressive, albeit liberal, minded state. In this context Romney was allowed to run as a fiscal conservative. If you look at the facts Romney was even pro-gay rights at that time. Then BOOM suddenly the 04 Olympics happen, Romney is a governor of MA with national ambitions and he has to change his message to align with voters on a national scale, not just in MA.

**Whats happening now** in our party is that voters on both sides are fed up. I was at CPAC a few weeks ago and you could've cut the tension in the air with a knife. The social conservatives found anything that my fiscally minded friends and I said about things like legalizing gay marriage, or scaling back on the abortion debate as blasphemous. While meanwhile I'm shaking my head when about 70% of the keynote speakers ruined an otherwise great speech by saying ""and then we should protect the sanctity of marriage"" somewhere in their last two sentences of a speech.

**Take a look at the candidacy of Jon Huntsman** as a testament to all this. Governor Huntsman was the candidate that the Obama administration was most worried about come November. He had a great record as Governor of Utah, put serving his country in front of politics by serving as Obama's ambassador to China, and would've been a voice which could have attracted the millions of voters disenfranchised by Obama's lackluster first term. However, if you broach this subject with any of these new-found hardliners they will call Huntsman Obama2.0. They will neglect things like the fact that the Governor from Utah had the best tax plan of any of the candidates and was endorsed by the Wall Street Journal, They will neglect that he put his country above partisan affiliation, etc. .etc. Why? because the Governor wanted to be a unifying force, he didn't want to play into the Us vs. THEM mentality. Unfortunately, that is what it take to get votes as a Republican right now--hence the ""flip-flopping"" of Gov. Romney
As a Republican, what do I see coming? This could go one of three ways...

**Option 1:** Santorum wins nomination--gets absolutely fucked in the ass by Obama on election day and the GOP immediately begins to ween off of their support of politicians like Santorum and social issues slowly become a thing of the past.

**Option 2:** Romney wins nomination--loses in a close election to Obama--the New Right yells ""we told you so"" and the Republicans endorse Santorum like candidate for the next mid-term election. Those candidates win in some states and lose in others, and we deal with the same problem in 4 more years.

**Option 3:** Romeny wins nomination and Presidency--Romneys true colors show and the GOP begins to SLOWLY move back toward the center with both large and small roadbumps along the way at every mid-term election.

What is see as most likely is that the GOP is on the verge of breaking into two parties. The social conservatives vs. the fiscal conservatives. There was a great article in the Huffington Post the other day describing how there is a new silent majority in America who think were on the verge of a 3rd party.

Really, it is.  But how do they keep winning elections with bad policy that consistently polls in the minority of voters?

**Your social policies drive away independent voters.**

For a group of people who claim to adamantly defend small government and freedom, preventing gays from getting married, making women get sonograms before receiving an abortion, pushing Jesus in the classroom, supporting foreign war, and continuing the painfully failed war on drugs are keeping the focus off of important economic truths that the democrats lose badly on.

If you want to win elections, then you should probably rethink some of this stuff.  Heck, if you want to even be consistent with the same principles of small government, you should abandon it.  Something that you should realize is that if it is in the Bible, why do you need a law to enforce God's words?   Why not just follow them yourselves, you know; live and let live?

Some good rules of thumb:

* Don't like gay marriage?  Don't get gay married.
 
* Don't like drugs?  Don't do them.

* Don't like gambling?  Don't gamble.

* Don't like other religions?  Don't follow them.

Etc... Just my humble suggestion.

I've served in the military, I'm a NRA member, so I hit some of the stereotypes of a good conservative. But I think a good conservative would allow gay marriage.

This isn't so much being pro gay marriage, but being anti-anti-gay marriage. If you're really against big government, you shouldn't be deciding who can marry who. If you want it to be a state issue, I'll buy that. Makes sense to me. So protest all you want, but you're foolish if you want a national amendment.

Also those hardcore conservatives that freak about taking God out of the government and/or preventing their worship. If a church allows gay marriage how would a ban not affect ""their"" religion?

More importantly: why should the government give a shit what two people do? I bet most Republicans deep down don't really care one way or the other. Unfortunately our party has let the vocal, crazy, ultra right wing to take over the party.

The only reason I bring this up is because of my GFs mom.

",59,31,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/wvgmr/i_am_becoming_increasingly_frustrated_by_the/,"I woke up this morning like most people to find out about the terrible tragedy that occurred in Aurora, Colorado. While the events that unfolded were undoubtedly sad and the shooter should unquestionably be reprimanded severely, I'm start to see an uproar of people, on Reddit and other places, blaming the events on 2nd Amendment rights, saying things like ""This is what Americans get for allowing everyone to have legal guns"", or ""I seriously hope people in Colorado start to rethink their gun control laws"".

I am becoming increasingly frustrated by this. This issue has been brought up so many times, and the core of it, the actual physicality of guns in this scenario is not what caused the problem, the person was. Everyone knows this, or at least I thought I did. For people to then oversimplify this to the point where you're just placing blame on the actual gun, it's becoming absurd. There's a phrase that says ""If you outlaw guns, the only people with guns will be outlaws"". Should this madmen should have never been allowed to own a gun? In hindsight, of course. But there are so many other issues of the story that are unanswered at this point before you can jump to that conclusion.

So, I wanted to get everyone elses' opinion - Was the gun in this scenario to blame? What are your stances on Second Amendment rights, and what steps do you believe we, as a country, should take in regards to gun control?",,False,self,t5_2qndt,False,,,True,t3_wvgmr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/wvgmr/i_am_becoming_increasingly_frustrated_by_the/,

Liberal Republicanism can be traced back all the way to our Founding Fathers who embraced Liberalism to overthrow tyranny by a King and established a Republican system of Government. Our Founding Fathers embraced what is now called ""Classic Liberalism, not to be confused with modern day Liberalism. If the GOP could get back to Classical Liberalism and produce candiates that believe in Classic Liberalism, it may actually deserve being called the Grand Old Party again. Before we go much further, I'd like to define what Liberalism actually is:

Liberalism is the political philosophy that holds equal rights and liberty as the basic moral principle of society guaranteed by a legal document (Constitution) and protected by Government. 

Why does the decline and fall of Liberal Republicanism matter? After all, rationalizing the political system into a more conservative GOP and a more-or-less liberal Democratic Party makes the alternatives clearer to the voters who are offered, in Goldwater's famous phrase, ""a choice, not an echo."" The demonizing of Liberalism by Conservative media outlets offers a vivid illustration of the Republican Party's mutation from a vibrant and diverse coalition to the dogmatic cult of conservative ideology that it has become today. The drive for ideological purity continues to this day, with Tea Party groups and fundraisers such as the Club for Growth targeting moderate conservatives after the liberals went extinct. First they came for the Liberals, then they came for the moderate conservatives, now all you have is the Republican base. In recent years, they helped force out Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Charlie Crist of Florida. This ideological purge not only disenfranchises moderate Republican voters in a general election, but narrows the Republican base. This will eventually (if not already) hinder the GOP's ability to win elections. I  believe none of the current GOP Presidential candidates will beat Obama. 

But it turns out that a Republican Party dominated by conservatives is no more coherent or effective at governing than a party dominated by progressives. The huge budget deficit left by George Bush is conservatism's Waterloo, testimony to its political failure. Modern day conservatives love to cut taxes, but can't square their lust for tax reduction with fiscal responsibility. It's this shortsightedness by the modern day GOP that history will most likely conclude: Opportunity wasted. Rather than compromising with Democrats for a balanced approach to create a bigger reduction of the deficit, we'll end up with something that neither parties will be happy with and the deficit will be reduced a fraction of what it could have been. 

Paradoxically, because previous Liberal Republicans didn't pretend to hate government, they were better at fiscal responsibility. They were willing to match their desired spending levels with the taxes to pay for them. It didn't make for exciting, to-the-barricades politics. It produced fiscal responsibility, a less dysfunctional government and a sense of responsible governing that voters like. 

Arguably, there are more Conservative Democrats than Liberal Republicans and I believe this is because moderate Republicans are being left in the dust by their own party. 

Hence why Liberal Republican is what we desperately need today in the atmosphere of partisan political venom that has our nation locked in a vise grip and has created one of the most dysfunctional Congresses in modern history. 

Thoughts, ideas, suggestions, opinions? 

PS. I actually happen to be a Liberal Democrat (who grew up in a Conservative home) and I write this not to attack Republicans, but I write it as constructive criticism so that you guys can  start to pull yourselves out of the hole you guys have dug. Frankly, the hole being dug is bringing the rest of the country down into it. We are at a point in time where we can no longer afford to be mired in ideological battles. I'm sure some in the Democratic Party would consider this post as aiding the enemy ;). However,  I have a feeling a lot of moderate Republicans can relate to what I'm pointing out here. My parents who have been staunch Republican voters for as long as I can remember are pretty unhappy with the current Republican field of candidates and the direction of their political party. And no, I do not consider Ron Paul as a Liberal Republican. He is a Libertarian, which is the extreme form of Liberalism. Frankly, I don't even know why he considers himself a Republican - he's more of a independent. 

Edit: For those who are downvoting, I'd actually like a reason why so we can have an honest discussion.

Note 1- I agree that the federal government is often more hurtful than helpful, I just think the republicans are even worse for the country than democrats.

Which are not? How did you come to hold these values/develop your ideology? Is being a Republican part of your identity, and if so why? If not, what role does ""being a Republican"" play in your life? In what ways are you conservative and how central do you see conservatism as being to Republican ideology? Which, if any, politicians seem to represent your views the best?

I'm not affiliated with any party and consider myself politically moderate overall, but I'm interested in learning more about our political parties. I'll be doing the requisite googling and research --- what I am interested in learning here is how individuals in the Republican party view the party and themselves in relation to it. This is not a troll post and I am not interested in debate or sharing my opinions on politics. I am here to learn and  I promise to limit all interactions in the comments to asking clarifying questions (and answering direct questions to me, if the need arises). I would prefer not to hear about what's wrong with other parties/political philosophies beyond some compare/contrast on nuanced differences --- I am here to learn about what you think of your *own* party. I hope this counts under ""ask polite questions in order to learn more about Republican ideology.""

My motivation to start with Republicans is because I was raised in a conservative Republican household and have an idea of what being a Republican means to the people who raised me (in particular my dad and his friends). My dad's the only person I've ever really talked to about politics, so my whole frame of reference on what it means to be a Republican comes from him, and I think knowing what Republicans who are not my dad believe will be beneficial for me as I learn more about the ideology. I will most likely not answer any questions about what he believes.
