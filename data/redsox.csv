I have said some pretty terrible things about you in my life. I'm a Yankees fan. A big one. I'm sure you've said some pretty terrible things about me and my kind too. What exists between our two cities is a fabled rivalry. We scream and we cheer and we fight for our cities, for our teams. It's a passion that without which, this rivalry could never be. Does anyone think that this sort of fan could be in a rivalry with anyone less passionate than themselves? No shot. It wouldn't hold up.
I was there when you guys beat us and went on the break records and win the World Series for the first time since 1918. To myself, and certainly not out loud, I was glad for you. You played well and you deserved it. As a dedicated sports fan, I knew how much that meant. As a Yankees fan, having seen my team win the World Series before, I couldn't even begin to fathom how amazing this must be for you, Boston fans, a first in most of your lifetimes. I came to learn later that this was the opinion of a majority of Yankee fans. We weren't happy. Far from it. But you are fans, long suffering, loyal fans. And you deserved it. And we got that.
I was in New York on 9/11. The fear, the confusion, the panic, all of it is burned into my memory. And so is the support your city had for us. What happened yesterday, Boston, what happened to you and your city, and in the moments after and what will come to be the days and months and years after, it's not ok, and it’s not easy. I'm not going to tell you that you will rise above and see the good in the people and your city, because it's been less than 24 hours and it's already evident. It's very evident.
But here's what I do know. Here's what I've learned from Red Sox fans and Yankees fans. Boston and New York have this in common; we are strong, we are passionate, we don't hold back, we love our cities. We love our people. You come to our town, and you try to break us? F you. We will mourn the losses and we will clean up our streets. We will cry and we try to explain to our children why this happened. But have no doubt, no one comes into our towns and breaks us.
For 86 years, you believed, almost every year, that your Red Sox were going to win the World Series. You want to mess with that sort of passion? I've watched you proudly march into our stadium with your Boston gear and cheer with definitive belief that you were champions with nothing more sometimes than faith and love for your city and your players. These are the people of Boston.
My heart hurts for you right now Boston. But you know what? There's this thought that keeps coming back to me. I just keep thinking, as evil as the person or people are that did this, they are just as stupid. You're gonna mess with that city?? On their day? I'm certain there's a special place in hell for the perpetrator of this attack, but what I'm even more certain of is this city just got stronger. And I didn't think that was possible. My sports analogy might seem trite but if I have learned anything as a lifetime Yankees fan, it's that Boston will not take this lying down. You are proud and you are strong. Go Boston. Go Sox. Go Celtics. Go Bruins. Go Patriots. I'm with you Boston. We all are. We are the same.
Sincerely, Yankees fan, Boston rival, and friend.",,False,self,t5_2qh95,False,,,True,t3_1cjety,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/1cjety/from_a_yankees_fan_to_boston/,

I've been a huge critic of yours since you arrived, and now I'm placing my foot directly in my mouth.  Myself and many others were pissed at you for seemingly always being injured while collecting an enormous salary.  

Given the treatment you've received in Boston before this season, you could have understandably lashed out at Sox fans and not given a shit about performing well for our team...  

But you didn't.  You got healthy, you kept your head on straight, and now you're arguably our best pitcher (Clay's still hurt).

I'm sorry John.  Please forgive me, and keep these quality starts coming.    ",,False,self,t5_2qh95,False,,08,True,t3_1hkeuh,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/1hkeuh/official_john_lackey_apology_thread/,moderator

The second I stepped out of Kenmore station and saw the Citgo sign I was just amazed. I absolutely loved the atmosphere and the pre-game tradition which I have never witnessed in Toronto, ever.

Fenway Park was simply amazing and the fans as well. Even with my Jays gear on I wasn't heckled and jawed at like I have for other sports except for a few guys which you have to expect. 

My only dislike was the seats being a bigger guy height and weight wise it was uncomfortable. But I noticed a man with his grandson in standing room behind me and offered my seat to them. 

I will be back to Fenway Park next year Jays game or not with my friends and will hopefully be able to get my ass into the seat for the whole game.

Again as a Jays fan I thank you guys for everything that I witnessed today and I'm sure I won't have a better baseball experience than this for a long time.",,False,self,t5_2qh95,False,,,True,t3_wzr54,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/wzr54/to_any_and_all_sox_fans_that_were_at_the_game/,

1371147735.0,58,self.redsox,1ga7r2,How are members of the 2012 Red Sox doing with other teams?,62,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/1ga7r2/how_are_members_of_the_2012_red_sox_doing_with/,"- **Kevin Youkilis** - *3B, New York Yankees* - Youk missed 38 games in April and May but is back in the lineup and is hitting .235/.318/.367 with two home runs. It would appear the loss of his beard and mustache has sapped much of his baseball playing prowess, although it could be that he turned 34.

- **Josh Beckett** - *SP, Los Angeles Dodgers* - The Beckett the Dodger fans have seen this season looks a lot like the guy we saw for much of 2012: he's 0-5 with a 5.19 ERA. His fastball velocity was down to career low 91.6 before he was put on the disabled list last month. More bad news: Beckett could face a suspension for being on the field during Tuesday's brawl with the Diamondbacks

- **Carl Crawford** - *LF, Los Angeles Dodgers* - Crawford had a very nice start to the season at the plate but has missed the last 11 games on the disabled list with a hamstring injury. The Los Angeles Dodgers have gone 5-6 without the $20 million man in the lineup, but his absence has also helped rookie sensation Yasel Puig get a spot on the team.

- **Adrian Gonzalez** - *1B, Los Angeles Dodgers* - Gonzalez has been very good so far, hitting an impressive .423 with runners in scoring position, and leading the Dodgers in most offensive categories. However, the Dodgers have to be disappointed that Gonzalez' power appears to be gone for good; he's on pace to hit just 20 this season, after hitting 18 a year ago.

- **Nick Punto** - *UT, Los Angeles Dodgers* - Injuries have led to Punto getting the fifth most at bats for the Dodgers, while playing solid defense at second base, shortstop and third base (five errors). He has a .663 OPS with a home run and a couple of stolen bases.

- **Mark Melancon** - *RHP, Pittsburgh Pirates* - Melancon also looks a lot like the guy we saw for the latter part of last season: he's been throwing strikes, not walking anyone,  but changes in his mechanics have led to lower velocity but a lot more ground balls. He leads the National League in Holds, and has a minuscule 1.15 ERA. 

- **Mike Aviles** -  *SS, Cleveland Indians* - Aviles, traded for John Farrell in the offseason, has played six positions in the field while hitting a solid .272. He's still not walking enough to really deserve a starting role, but he's a valuable bench player for Francona's new team. 

- **Cody Ross** - *OF, Arizona Diamondbacks* - Ross has struggled since signing a four year, $34.5 million contract. He has just 2 home runs since coming off the disabled list in April. 

Just thought it'd be interesting to see how all the trades, and free agency non-moves worked out. Seems like Cherington was right not to offer Ross a deal (Nava and Gomes have been better and cheaper), while Iglesias appears to be a much better utility glove and bat than both Punto and Aviles. Trading Youkilis to make room for Middlebrooks was also a good decision. 

None of three big nameplayers sent to the Dodgers have really performed up to their contract: Beckett/Crawford/Gonzalez  ($58 million) have been effectively replaced with Dempster/Victorino/Napoli ($31 million), and the Dodger's are stuck with aging players on much longer contracts.

Overall, I'd say Cherington has done a pretty solid job bringing the team back from the brink. Only move he'd like to have back is Melancon, but Uehara is more than an adequate replacement.",,False,self,t5_2qh95,False,,,True,t3_1ga7r2,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/1ga7r2/how_are_members_of_the_2012_red_sox_doing_with/,

1335897918.0,55,self.redsox,t1vpv,Stephen King's foreword in the Fenway 100 book,59,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/t1vpv/stephen_kings_foreword_in_the_fenway_100_book/,"I grew up in rural Maine, at a time when kids got their drivers' licenses early. My best friend's big brother got his at 16, and his father offered him a deal. Drive accident free for a year, he said, and you can take the car to Boston and watch the Red Sox play at Fenway Park. He made it through the year, and one day in the late summer of 1959, a bunch of us piled into an old Ford station wagon and make the 100-plus-mile drive to the only ballpark that mattered to kids from New England.

Not that the Red Sox were such a hot ticket back then; for most of the '50s they wandered in the Big League wilderness, almost always finishing behind the hated Yankees. You could get a seat in the second tier for just a couple bucks (a box seat might have set you back a five-spot), and many fans of what my uncle called ""the Dead Sox"" might have argued that even 75 cents for a bleacher seat was too much. The 1959 season wasn't any different; the Olde Towne Team finished with a record of 75 wins and 79 losses, 19 games behind the pennant-winning White Sox.

According to the endlessly carnivorous Hub sportswriters, team spirit was low to nonexistent. There was the widely believed (but untrue) anecdote about how, after games at Fenway, 25 players left the park in 25 different taxis. Ted Williams, the greatest player ever to wear a Red Sox uniform, was in the twilight of his career, and average attendance hovered around 13,000 per game (compare that to the last few years, when the Red Sox have sold out the park for more than 700 consecutive games).

But they were what we had, and we loved them. We said howdy to Curt Gowdy when he came crackling over the AM band of our transistor radios, and we listened to him, along with Bob Murphy and Bill Crowley, during games that were televised - in beautiful black and white - on weekend afternoons. We groaned and covered our eyes when cleanup hitter Vic Wertz struck out in clutch situations, and pounded our legs in frustration when yet another Red Sox pitcher - Mike Fornieles, or maybe Murray Wall - gave up a bunch of runs. We waited for the days when Ike Delock or Bill Monbouquette (""Monbo"") took the mound. Those were pitchers you could count on, we told each other.

Well, mostly.

Win or lose, we cared. We had to care, because who else were we going to root for? The rich-boy Yankees? Please. If you asked a kid what he wanted for his birthday, or where he'd most like to be on the Fourth of July, you could pretty much count on the answer: Fenway Park. We were country kids, clodhopper farmboys and farmgirls. For us, a trip to Portland, Maine or Portsmouth, N.H., was a big deal. And Fenway? That would have been like a trip to Mecca, or Lourdes, or Notre Dame Cathedral. It was the hardball Nirvana we imagined when we heard Gowdy yelling, ""That ball's hit deep! Williams back ... back ... up against the wall ... he leaps ... he's got it! Williams made the catch!"" It was the miniature park we saw - blurrily, as if through smeared spectacles - on the tiny 19-inch screens of our TVs. To go there was one of the things I wanted most in the world.

And in the late summer of 1959, I got the chance.

I was 12 years old, and although I'd played plenty of baseball in the potato field across from the one-room school I attended in West Durham, Maine, and had watched a few Babe Ruth League games at the nearest high school, I had never seen a professional playing field. The memory of the first time I did is perfectly clear and still wonderful more than 50 years later.

We drove into the grimy city, and after a certain amount of wandering (we were country kids, remember), we found our way to the Fens, where an elderly gent - he must have been all of 40 - took our 50-cent fee and waved us into the half-filled parking lot under a billboard advertising Optimo Cigars. In those days, Fenway was surrounded by sooty buildings and sinister-looking bars, but as we approached the ticket windows, we could hear the organ and smell roasting peanuts - the best sound and aroma combo ever, in this New England boy's humble opinion.

We wandered around a dark concourse, almost feeling our way. We purchased soda and hot dogs. Today you can buy all sorts of good grub at Fenway, including fruit cups, veggie burgers and clam ""chowdah,"" but in '59 your choices were much more limited: peanuts, popcorn, and hot dogs. The pups cost a dime, and when it came to dressing them up, you had one choice and one choice only: mustard-by-the-post.

Snacks in hand, we walked up the ramp toward a framed square of blue New England sky. And when we came out into the sunshine ... man, my breath caught in my throat. Nothing I'd heard on the radio or seen on television could have prepared me for how preposterously beautiful Fenway Park was on that August day. John Updike called it ""a lyric little bandbox of a ballpark,"" but to me there was nothing little about it. It looked like a gigantic green jewel shining in the afternoon sun. I had loved the Red Sox since I was old enough to wave a souvenir pennant in my chubby little fist, but that was the day, that was the moment, when I fell in love with the park. There is nothing like it, literally nothing, in all of professional sports. We saw the Tigers play that day, and Al Kaline hit a double. I heard the crack of the bat, so much louder than it was when it came through a speaker - so much truer - and saw the ball kick off the center-field wall. I ate my hot dog; I drank my soda; I caught a bag of peanuts; I thought I might have died and gone to heaven.

Since the mid-'80s, I've been a season ticket holder. I've seen some great games and some amazing performances. I've watched Bob ""The Steamer"" Stanley pop beach balls in the bullpen and commiserated with my daughter when she fell in love with Calvin Schiraldi (mostly, I think, it was the hair). I held my youngest son when he burst into tears after his idol, Oil Can Boyd, lost to the Mets in Game 3 of the 1986 World Series. I was on my feet - and in agony - when Tom Brunansky disappeared from view, chasing Ozzie Guillen's ninth-inning drive on Oct. 3, 1990. One of those Fenway eccentricities - in this case, the way the right-field stands jut out -  made it impossible for anyone on the first-base side of the park to see the catch. It wasn't until the bleacher creatures leaped to their feet, roaring in triumph, that we knew Brunansky had indeed made the catch and that the AL East title was ours.

Here's what I'm saying, in case you missed it: There are good Red Sox teams and teams that aren't so good, but our ballpark is always the best. It's unique, and you can't really claim it until you've spent time there yourself, getting used to its agreeable strangeness. When you can talk about Canvas Alley and the Pesky Pole, it's yours. When you've seen your share of weird bounces in the left-field corner and watched the giant flag unfurl over the Green Monster a few times, it's yours. When you've heard the bonk of a line-drive caroming off the tin of that selfsame Green Monster, or watched crazed fans with their rally caps turned around backward pounding on the padding over by the home dugout, it's yours. You've reached the inner circle.

Any guy or gal with a Red Sox T-shirt and a TV can be a resident of Red Sox Nation; we welcome all comers. But once you've been to the park a few times, once you've had a chance to breathe that special air, you become part of the smaller circle - an enchanted circle, in my opinion. Then you can claim your citizenship in Fenway nation. There's no better place on Earth.",,False,self,t5_2qh95,True,,,True,t3_t1vpv,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/t1vpv/stephen_kings_foreword_in_the_fenway_100_book/,

Tido is a player's manager, he stuck with Ortiz during the hard times, and look where that got him (6th in batting in the AL).

Guide to Visiting Fenway
------------------------

So, you'd like to visit Fenway Park, eh? Well, you're not alone. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people make the trip up Brookline Avenue and into America's Most Beloved Ballpark. In this guide, I will give you various tips and tricks I have learned over the years, and other useful information. So dust off your mitt, don your favorite jersey, and let's get going!

Getting There
-------------
Arguably one of the most important steps is actually getting yourself to the ballpark. This is a relatively easy task, but one can stray off the path very quickly and get lost in one of Boston's many small streets. Most fans make their way to the Fens via the MBTA, locally known as the ""T"" (NOT the subway). Fenway Park sits between two stops on the Green Line, Kenmore and Fenway. Often times, fans make the mistake of thinking the Fenway stop is actually at Fenway Park. This is *not* the case. While it is close, you may be better off going to the Kenmore stop. Let me break it down for you.

If you are coming from downtown Boston, you will be on an outbound train. Your best bet is to get off at Kenmore, since the Fenway stop actually goes past the Park. Once in Kenmore Square, head up Brookline Avenue, and over the Mass Pike bridge. You won't be able to miss the Park. When the game is over and you're back in Kenmore, you will want to take an **inbound** train to get to wherever you came from. It is the stairs on the right hand side after paying your fare.

If you are coming from the Riverside parking lot (as a lot of people do), you will be on an inbound train. In this case, the opposite holds true. You will want to get off at Fenway, since you will go past the Park on your way to Kenmore. Once off the train, simply follow the signs. You will follow a sidewalk along the tracks, behind the Landmark Center, and eventually end up on Brookline Avenue (you should see a Chipotle and Sal's Pizza). Take a left, and the Park will be just up the street. When the game is over, you will want to take an **outbound** train. This stop gets **very** crowded after the game, so expect to become very good friends with whomever you are next to on the train.

**Note:** The MBTA has a front door only policy on above ground green line stops, which includes the Fenway stop. Sometimes if there is a large crowd, they will open all doors, but this may not be the case. Be prepared to make your way to the front of the train in order to exit.

In both cases, if you are unsure as to where you are going, you can bet there will be a large crowd going to the same place you are. Sometimes, it's better to be a follower.

Fare prices are $2 on a plastic CharlieCard, or $2.50 for paper CharlieTicket or cash on board. All underground T stations have fare machines, and Riverside does as well. There are also a couple fare machines located inside Fenway, by Gate A.

[Green Line map](http://i.imgur.com/Y7vLJKP.png)

If you are ambitious enough to drive, there is a multitude of parking around the area, but be ready to pay upwards of $30. You can try parking somewhere else in the city and taking the T in, but check all street signs to make sure it isn't a resident only parking area (you will get a ticket) or there isn't scheduled street cleaning going on at the time (you will get towed). For more information, check the [City of Boston parking website](http://www.cityofboston.gov/parking/).

Getting Tickets
---------------
So you've got your tickets printed out a week in advance, and are ready to go...wait, you don't have tickets yet? Never fear, there are a few ways you can gain access to the game. Your first option is to check the internet. StubHub is a usual favorite, and tickets can be found for decent prices, especially if you don't mind sitting in the bleachers. If you need them ASAP, make sure the ticket is available to download, so you don't have to wait for it to come in the mail. Some people also use Ace Ticket, and it never hurts to check redsox.com, where tickets can be bought directly from the team.

Maybe you're the adventurous/spontaneous type, and want to try your luck at the park. Scalpers are usually all up and down Brookline Avenue, from Kenmore Square to Kilmarnock Street. Be cautious if using this approach, as the prices are usually quoted above face value (the price printed on the ticket itself). A good tip for dealing with them is to attempt to haggle a bit, and if they are not willing to go down to a price you are comfortable with, simply walk away. Many times, they will reconsider and chase after you. If they don't, don't worry. There are plenty of others to speak to. Another tip for the patient fan is to wait until the game starts. Often times, the prices will go down, as the tickets are now losing value rapidly. Your best bet is to wait until the bottom of the first inning, as scalpers will still be around the park, but at that point they are getting desperate.

If you want to purchase tickets the day of the game, but are more of an honest person, Fenway offers game day ticket sales at Gate E. The ticket window opens an hour and a half prior to game time, however patrons are allowed to form a line 5 hours beforehand, and that rule is rarely enforced. If you are going to go this route, I highly suggest getting there early. It doesn't hurt to take a look and see if a line is forming yet. Tickets are on a first come, first served basis, and anywhere can be available (I've had one day where they had Monster seats, and another day where they only had standing room only). This can be a very safe and affordable way to get tickets, however you could strike out.

Purchasing Apparel
------------------
So, you want a new player tee? Or is it chillier than you thought, and want to invest in a new sweatshirt? The Red Sox Team Store likely has everything you're looking for, but it can sometimes be a bit pricey. Before heading into the park, check the Marshalls at 126 Brookline Ave. for lower prices. It may not be authentic, but it'll get the job done.

Let's say, however, that you are really interested in the official on field jacket/sweatshirt/hat. The Team Store is the place to be. It offers official Nike dri-fit shirts, old time jerseys (Williams, Yaz, Fisk), and more fashionable shirts and sweatshirts. They also stock every style of hat imaginable, from traditional baseball to bucket and even yarmulkes! They are constantly getting new items in every day, so be sure to check back each time you visit the park.

Discounts accepted at the Team Store include: AAA* (10%), military* (10%), [trolley coupon](http://www.trolleytours.com/boston/day-tour-boston-mass.asp) (10%), Red Sox Nation* (10%), and Season Ticket holder* (10%).

*Must present respective cards.

There are also a bunch of street vendors in Kenmore Square before and after the game selling various novelties and clever-worded T-shirts. Also, right by the Fenway T stop behind the Landmark Center, there is someone that sells hats for $5.

Seating Guide
---------------
Where you sit depends entirely on your budget. The great thing about Fenway Park is that pretty much every seat is close to the action. If you are willing to spend the extra money, I would suggest the field boxes. The loge boxes are a little cheaper, and still offer almost the same view as the field boxes (loge boxes are a section behind field boxes). If you don't feel like spending that much on tickets (who could blame you), the bleacher seats are an affordable option that still have great views.

For perspective on what seats have what views:

[Field Box 30](http://i.imgur.com/262wd.jpg)

[Bleacher 43](http://i.imgur.com/MgVdF.jpg)

[Infield Grandstand 13](http://i.imgur.com/M98Oh.jpg)

As you can see, every seat offers a unique and spectacular view of Fenway Park and the game itself.

Due to the age and antiquity of Fenway, some seats are [obstructed view](http://i.imgur.com/54zPs5L.jpg), which means you will have a pole in the way. Any seat that is obstructed view will have ""OBST."" on the ticket. Don't let scalpers fool you.

You can also check out [Precise Seating](http://www.preciseseating.com/fenwaypark2.php) to get a very good idea of what your seat view will look like.

America's Most Beloved Ballpark
-------------------------------
Fenway Park did not earn that moniker by accident. At the ripe old age of 101, Fenway Park is still going strong, with much to be seen around it. The gates for all games open an hour and a half before first pitch, so if you have your tickets in advance, I would suggest getting there at that time. There is a lot to be seen inside the ballpark, and before you know it the Red Sox will be taking the field.

If you are entering at Gate A or D (either end of Yawkey Way), your first trip must be into the Red Sox Team Store. Even if you are set on not purchasing any apparel, it is still worth the trip. There is years of history in this store, which has been in the same spot since 1947. Often in the back of the store, there is a section called ""Autograph Alley"", where fans can get a free autographed picture and meet a former Red Sox player. Rarely, a current roster member will come into the store to take pictures with fans.

Once you head into the park, you can make your way to your seat or take a stroll around. There is much to see on the walls all around the park, and a walk is well worth the time and effort. Unfortunately, the Green Monster is open to Monster ticket holders only, but if you would like to get an idea of the vantage point, make your way to the western side of the wall (by section 33). There is an area that technically isn't on the Monster, but you still have a great view down the left field line.

For those of you that smoke, Fenway Park is a smoke-free facility. However, a designated smoking area is set up on Yawkey Way, in between the Red Sox Team Store and the '47 Brand store. There are no alcoholic beverages allowed in the smoking area, so make sure to down those before you enter.

Bars/Restaurants
----------------
The Fenway area of Boston is an incredibly lively place, with many bars and restaurants for your choosing. I will highlight a few:

* [The Yard House](http://www.yardhouse.com/MA/boston-restaurant/) (126 Brookline Ave.) - The Yard House is a very unique restaurant. They boast over 100 varieties of beer on tap. It is a definite must-see for the beer enthusiast. I can't speak too much on the food, but they have a pretty large menu and from what I've had, it seems very good. 21+ at night.

* [Sal's Pizza](http://www.sals-pizza.com/locations/fenway-boston-ma/) (132 Brookline Ave.) - Incredible pizza place. Kind of small interior, but their ""slice"" is two slices anywhere else. Best bang for your buck when it comes to pizza. Also have a few beers on tap.

* [Cask 'n Flagon](http://www.casknflagon.com/) (62 Brookline Ave.) - Iconic bar on the corner of Brookline and Landsdowne St. Voted one of ESPN's best baseball bars in the country. Food is decent, but people definitely go for the atmosphere. If you can't get tickets to the game, consider watching in here. You can always sprint out to Landsdowne if you see a ball going over the Monster! 21+ at night.

* [The Bleacher Bar](http://bleacherbarboston.com/flash/#/home/) (82A Landsdowne St.) - This is a relatively new bar that is built right into the outfield bleachers of the park. It looks into center field, and you can stay and watch the game as long as you are ordering something. 21+

* [Game On!](http://www.gameonboston.com) (82 Landsdowne St.) - Sort of your typical sports themed restaurant. Decent food, upstairs and downstairs dining/bar area. Lots of TVs. 21+ at night.

* [Boston Beer Works](http://www.beerworks.net) (61 Brookline Ave.) - Classic restaurant/brewpub type place. Haven't been, but heard good things. Lots of beer choices. 21+ at night.

* Best Sausage Co. (~3 Yawkey Way) - Right outside Gate A, this is a great sausage place. They also serve pizza, ice cream, and a variety of soft drinks.

* Food Carts on Landsdowne (Landsdowne St.) - Before the game, you can often find a bunch of food carts set up on Landsdowne serving sausage, hot dogs, kebobs, some even have barbecue.

* [Who's On First](http://www.whosonfirstatfenway.com/) (19 Yawkey Way) - This bar is located under the Team Store, so you have to have a ticket to get in. I've never been inside, so I can't speak to how it is, however I do know that it is a little-known loophole to getting alcohol after the seventh inning. Admission to the bar will not exit you from the park, and you can feel free to return to your seat after a few brews for that extra inning game. 21+

* [Tasty Burger](http://www.tastyburger.com/tasty-burger-fenway/) (1301 Boylston St.) - Incredibly good burgers. They also have hot dogs and chicken sandwiches, and drinks include soda, milkshakes, slushes, beer, and wine. Definitely consider if you are looking for greasy, cheap food.

Hotels
------
Since I live in Boston, I unfortunately have no experience with hotels in the area. For your convenience, I will link to [Hotels near Fenway Park](http://www.tripadvisor.com/HotelsNear-g60745-d105250-Fenway_Park-Boston_Massachusetts.html) on Trip Advisor. I do know that the closest hotel to the park is a Howard Johnson, around the corner on Boylston St.

Other Insider Tips
------------------
These are a few tips I've gathered throughout the years.

1. Want to touch some Fenway dirt? You don't have to trespass onto the field, or purchase a framed cup of it. The trees on Yawkey Way are planted in the same red dirt that's on the field.

2. Despite what vendors outside the park will tell you, *Boston Baseball Magazine* is not more expensive inside the park. In fact, it's not even sold in the park! The only magazine available inside Fenway is the official *Red Sox Magazine*. That being said, *Boston Baseball* is still a good buy. It comes with a bumper sticker/scorecard, and the articles can be a bit more opinionated.

3. Sometimes Luis Tiant can be seen eating his own Cuban sandwiches at El Tiante on Yawkey Way. If you recognize him, he will usually oblige to pictures and autographs, however they don't make a big to-do about it like Autograph Alley. You're on your own to spot him.",,False,self,t5_2qh95,1371760332.0,,bostonstrong,True,t3_1cm1nh,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/1cm1nh/guide_to_fenway_park/,

I dislike golf, tennis, ice hockey, handball, bandy (a form of hockey). I do like NFL and I do like Baseball...well..I don't know if I like baseball or not.

I saw a real baseball game in San Fransisco back in 2002 and they played the Rockies and it was quite good fun to see and actually be there, I even ate a hotdog. Bonds was not playing..I was quite dissapointed about that.

Now I have been to New York and Pittsburgh and find that the East coast people are a bit more realistic to get along with compared to their West coast counterparts. A bit tougher and more stern I guess. And I love the music of the Dropkick Murphys and Flogging Molly, and the general attitude. Which leads me to the Irish of which I am 1/2 Irish and 1/2 Scottish and my love of New York city (I''m a terrible tourist, forgive that) but I don't want to like the Yankees and the natural predator of a Yankee, I hear, is a Red Sox fan. It makes perfect sense in my head that I would gravitate towards the Red Sox.
And as I don't live in the USA and owe no allegiance to any state or city..I guess going by blood might be a good idea...right?

And so I find myself here. So I am going to buy a years sub to MLB.tv, I've downloaded the Red Sox app for my Android phone and I'm going to start keeping track of the Red Sox and see if I can't turn this curiosity into an actual interest.

Have I perhaps made a gigantic error in doing this? :)

EDIT: Hey thanks everyone :) I'm glad I made this post.

Welcome back, folks.

I figured I'd get the thread out early, being that this is the first game of the year, just so people can find it before the first pitch. 

I should be back to making quite a few threads this season, not sure I'll be here for every game, but I should be here for most. 

Enjoy the game everyone! I hope you're all as excited as I am for Opening Day.

Hey everyone, I hope everyone is having a good night.

I invited the Rangers fans from [/r/TexasRangers](/r/TexasRangers) to join us, it should make for a more interesting discussion during the game, so I ask that you please stay civil and have fun. 

Should be a good pitching matchup, let's hope that Lester can keep it going and the offense can back him up for a change. Youk's back in the lineup today, hopefully he gets hot.

Do you guys have any suggestions?

If ever there was a day to skip ""Sweet Caroline,"" in favor of some decorum, this was it.
&gt; 
&gt; But the song played and on one of the most embarrassing days in franchise history, people sang, ""So good! So good!"" like they were drunk at a wedding.
&gt; 
&gt; It's only a song and if people want to sing, so be it. But let's forget about the notion that Fenway Park is a tough place to play and is full of hard-core fans. Because it's not any more. It's a place where people gleefully sing a cheesy song after their team blows a nine-run lead.
&gt; 
&gt; Nobody is singing when they home team is getting embarrassed at Yankee Stadium or Citizens Bank Park. Bruins fans weren't singing at the Garden Saturday. Either winning really matters or it doesn't. If it does, put the silly song on the shelf during games like this.

And this isn't a one-year fluke, either: He has a career WHIP of 0.9 which is actually better than Mariano Rivera.

All of this is a long way of saying, no matter how well Bailey does in the coming weeks, he shouldn't replace Koji as closer. If he can turn into a key setup man that's fine.

Hey guys, I'm making the thread a little early tonight in hopes that it will reach the front page before the start of the game.

This sub-reddit has come a long way since I started making these threads, from 70 or so comments to regularly reaching over 200. It's been nice to be a part of this sub-reddit's flurry of activity, as the content continued coming, the community responded and now the sub is better than ever, with a whole new re-design and active nightly game threads. 

It was just last season when this sub would go without a new post for days, now we have discussion all over the place. I'm glad and I hope we continue to grow.

It is nice to be able to cherish a victory, but now the Sox are back to work with Beckett on the hill, after back to back strong starts (4 ER in 15 IP). Hopefully he can keep it going tonight and the offense will back him up.

Alright everyone, thanks for reading (if you did!). Should be a good game tonight, I look forward to you guys joining me. Hope you're enjoying your evenings.

**Please upvote this thread, I receive no Karma. I just want it to be visible. Please and thank you.**

Hey everyone! Good evening. Time for Game One against the A's.

Good to be home! The Sox exceeded expectations on their road trip and now look to continue that success here at home.

Things to watch for:

-Old friend Josh Reddick is back at Fenway! He is batting third for the A's. It will be good to see him back. Hopefully he gets an ovation.

-This is a huge start for Buchholz. Every other pitcher in the rotation has proven they belong. Buch needs to get a good start here, against a weaker offense, at home. Hope he does.

-It is the Sox first look at Yoenis Cespedes! The Cuban phenom has been exactly what everyone thought he would be. Extraordinary power, ton of K's. His power is legit, if anyone has watched the A's highlights this season, you'll know what I mean.

Alright guys, the thread should be a full strength tonight, after I was forced to miss yesterday's. Hope everyone is having a good evening.

Hey everyone. I had to kind of rush this thread today, as I'm heading out.
 

I'm going to be gone for at least for the first half of the game, and maybe the whole thing. Hopefully I can make it back home for at least the tail end of it. 

Alright guys, enjoy the thread, hope I get to join in for at least a bit.

Hey everyone! Good evening. The thread is back looking good and is on time tonight after last night's late start. 

The Red Sox are finally showing some life, sweeping the Twins. Tonight we get to see Humber, the man who threw the 21st Perfect Game last week. Let's hope his success does not continue tonight. Ross is out of the lineup tonight, as Lars Anderson gets a start, but other than that, Bobby V seems to have settled on this lineup. 

It's been working as Aviles has been mashing at the top. 

I just want to thank everyone for joining me every night. It's nice to have like-minded people to talk to while I watch, as no one I know IRL is really into baseball. It's been getting better as we go, and more and more people have been a part of these. I've started to notice a group of ""regulars"" if you will, who have joined me almost every night. I appreciate it and I hope you're enjoying these as much as I am.

Alright, hope everyone is having a nice evening. I have a buddy coming over with a 6-pack so I'm not sure how active I'll be in the thread, but I'll certainly be chiming in.

1372507947.0,28,self.redsox,1hb2jf,Jose Iglesias and the AL Rookie of the Year race,33,5,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/1hb2jf/jose_iglesias_and_the_al_rookie_of_the_year_race/,"I was surprised to see our boy Jose Iglesias is leading all AL rookies with 52 hits (and in triples, and most rate statistics). Sure, it hasn’t been a good year for 2013’s rookie class, but it’s still a legit award. I thought it might be fun to look at the competitors in the race so far, and talk about how they stack up against Iglesias.

- **Oswaldo Arcia** *LF Minnesota Twins* The 22 year old outfielder leads all rookies in home runs, runs batted in, and total bases. His one weakness with the bat has been striking out a ton, but Twins manager [Ron Gardenhire said the other day that he was pleased with Arcia’s improvements at the plate](http://www.twincities.com/twins/ci_23555400/minnesota-twins-oswaldo-arcia-contending-al-rookie-year). He also hits both right and left handed pitchers equally well. Playing a corner outfield spot does hurt his chances a bit, and playing on a fourth place Twins team that doesn’t get much national media attention doesn't help either. 

- **Cody Allen** *RHP, Cleveland Indians* Allen has easily been the [best relief pitcher for Tito’s Tribe](http://www.letsgotribe.com/2013/6/20/4446848/cleveland-indians-bullpen-news-chris-perez-return-delayed), and ranks first among AL rookie relievers with 40 strikeouts. Normally it’s difficult for a pitcher to get much ROY consideration without being a starter or closer, but this year’s class of rookies is lacking in both so Allen has an outside chance if he keeps pitching well for an Indians team that is, surprisingly, still in contention. 

- **Nick Franklin** *2B, Seattle Mariners* Franklin, also 22, is second in on-base percentage and stolen bases among AL rookies. The switch hitter replaced former second overall pick Dustin Ackley at second base and his contributions on offense have been a big boost for a Seattle team struggling to score. On the other hand, he has committed all three errors by Mariners’ second basemen despite only playing there for a third of the season.

- **Wil Myers** *RF, Tampa Bay Rays* Myers was the prized prospect acquired from the Royals in the James Shields trade. He’s been with the Rays for just two weeks and already has three home runs, including a [grand slam off of C.C. Sabathia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_LQJsKzrZk). 

Out of all those guys, I think Myers has the best shot catching Iglesias. He came into this season as the fourth ranked prospect by Baseball America, and he’s already shown he can hit for power. He’s playing for a contender in the best division in baseball, so if he continues to hit it out of the park, the hype train will really get going.

That said, I think Iglesias’ defensive play is a huge advantage. He has played at two relatively difficult infield positions, while Arcia and Myers play corner outfield spots, and neither those two nor Franklin are known for having a plus glove. If he keeps hitting at a decent pace, I feel like the award is definitely his to lose.",,False,self,t5_2qh95,False,,,True,t3_1hb2jf,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/1hb2jf/jose_iglesias_and_the_al_rookie_of_the_year_race/,

Wednesday July 31 was the craziest day for me. It started out with court in the morning for a case where I was arrested for B&amp;E. The case ended up getting dismissed so I was really excited. I had a 12:30 flight to Chicago to get lunch with my girl and come back that night (I work for an airline, free flights) but court took so long that we missed the flight. And then add a $15 ticket for overtime parking. 

I was kinda bummed out about that and not being able to go to chicago, so I decided to just take her out to a nice lunch instead and we went to Stephanie's on Newbury. $60 lunch but it was AMAZING. Got the onion ring tower and the oversized burger, totally worth it. Ive never left a restaurant feeling so satisfied. So we leave all smiles and go back to my car, which I parked right on the street, but couldn't find it. Instead, we see a UPS truck, and that's when I see the ""Loading Zone No Parking"" signs. Fuck. 

So I make some phone calls and locate my car at the transportation Dept. $20 for a taxi to get there and $93 to release it to me. I'm just a college kid too, so this basically emptied my bank account. We find my car in the lot and that's when I see they also decided to throw a $55 ticket for parking in the loading zone. I'm not trying to argue it though, I should have seen the signs. It just sucks. So now I'm really fucking bummed out. My day has been so up and down at this point I just wanna go home and sleep. My only day off in like two weeks and it sucks. That's when she says shes gonna take me to the Red Sox game. 

I was kinda skeptical because I never liked baseball. I played as a kid and hated it, and could never understand how people could sit and watch it on tv. But I agreed to at least give it a chance since I've never been to a Sox game or to Fenway. I've been to plenty of Pawsox games but that's a lot different. I felt really awkward because I was still dressed nice from court and didn't have any clothes to change into. 

So we head over and grab some cheap tickets in the family section. As soon as I crossed the bridge from Kenmore I felt totally different. And as you all know, the game was amazing. What a great first baseball game. Got a fenway frank, did the wave, it was awesome. Once that guy I don't remember hit that bomb out of the park and the place erupted in screams, it sent chills down my spine. I love baseball now and can't wait to go to more games. I'm on my phone so I'll upload a couple pics from my first game. 

As I said before, I get free flights so now we are looking at flying out to either San Fransisco on the 21st or LA that Saturday for the giants or the dodgers game. Any recommendations to which one?

1371907016.0,24,self.redsox,1gurfd,"Gomes, Victorino, and the future of the Red Sox outfield",31,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/1gurfd/gomes_victorino_and_the_future_of_the_red_sox/,"Let’s be real, the free agency signings of Jonny Gomes and Shane Victorino seemed pretty underwhelming. I don’t think anyone expected Ben Cherington to join the Josh Hamilton or Justin Upton sweepstakes, but spending $49 million on a couple of 32 year old outfielders didn’t seem to fit with the Red Sox trying to get younger and cheaper. Why not re-sign Cody Ross? Why not give Jackie Bradley Jr. a try?

With just about half of the 2013 season over, however, it looks to me like these were great moves, both for the current team, and the future, and here’s why:

- **Jonny Gomes** hasn’t yet hit for average, but he’s hit a few home runs and has been walking a ton, as well as booting one of the [most impressive punts](http://wapc.mlb.com/play/?content_id=28145821) in Fenway Park history. With a lineup full of left handed hitters (Drew, Ellsbury, Ortiz, Bradley Jr.), and switch hitters who struggle against left handed pitchers (Nava, Saltalamacchia) the Red Sox needed an outfield bat that could hit lefties and the front office probably viewed Ross as a platoon player. Paying Gomes $10 million over two years to fill that role was less risky than the Diamondbacks giving Ross $26 million for three. The other benefit of having Gomes on the roster meant that Daniel Nava got a chance to play, and he has been demolishing right handed pitching (.295). The Gomes/Nava platoon has as many home runs as Justin Upton for around half the cost ($5.5 million).

- **Shane Victorino** does a lot of things well offensively: he switch hits, gets on base, steals bases, hits a few home runs. The key thing with Victorino, though, is that he can play all three outfield positions. The Red Sox have known for some time that Jacoby Ellsbury is likely to test the free agency market, and that it’s very likely he doesn’t play for next year’s team. Having Victorino signed for the next three years mean the Red Sox are not forced to play Jackie Bradley Jr. in centerfield if they don’t think he’s ready. 
John Farrell said a few days ago “you can ever underestimate the people inside the players”. I think that’s definitely true with these guys. Gomes and Victorino have both been with winning teams in the past, and chemistry matters. The Red Sox definitely have had rosters full of All Stars in recent years, but it hasn’t really looked like a great team since 2008.

Performance and chemistry aside, did the Red Sox overpay?  I don’t think so. The Athletics offered Gomes a [2 year/$5 million contract](http://blog.sfgate.com/athletics/2012/11/21/red-sox-working-to-sign-gomes/), and the Indians were willing to give Victorino [$44 million over 4 years](https://twitter.com/Ken_Rosenthal/status/276112170830422016). With the Red Sox coming off of a last place finish, I don’t think you could have expected free agents to take a discount to play in Boston.

While injuries may have forced the Red Sox to play various combinations, this is still the best outfield group the Red Sox have had in years. It might not have many household names, but it’s getting the job done. Good work, Benny.

I predicted a fourth place finish before the season even started.  I just had a feeling it wasn't our year.  Oh well.

But I was thinking about my favorite Fenway memories, and one in particular stands out in my mind.  It was June 2, 2005 [EDIT:(thanks to MyVagueName for getting the correct date)].  A good friend of mine got my brother and I two bleacher tickets for an afternoon game against the Orioles.  Around the 4th inning, my friend calls and said two seats just opened up about six rows behind home plate, and that my brother and I should come claim them before someone else does.  So, we head down, and I am awestruck at how incredible these seats are.  I can see the motion on pitches, and see beads of sweat on the players' brows.  It was sublime.

So, we're down to the ninth inning.  The score is 4-3 Baltimore, and BJ Ryan is in to close the game.  First up was Mark Bellhorn.  I always had a soft spot for that kid.  Maybe it's because he looked like Pigpen from Peanuts.  Maybe it's because he always either struck out or did something awesome.  I think I can count how may times he walked on one hand.  He singles.  I forget the sequence of events after that, but it ends up two outs with Edgar Renteria up to bat.  For some reason, the third baseman is playing way off third base, and Renteria sees the opportunity to drop a perfect bunt right down the right field line to get on base.  

So here we are.  Two men on.  Two outs.  And Big Papi comes up to the plate.  He's facing one of the best left-handed closers in the AL at the time, and I'm just thinking that there's no way a lefty power hitter is gonna get one past BJ Ryan.  The count works up to 3-2.  Everyone in the park is on their feet.  Ryan throws a fastball down and in, right into Papi's hot zone, and he crushes it to dead center.

Good evening everyone.

Tough loss last night, but one we should be okay with, as the pitching was excellent, in particular the bullpen. The 'pen has become quite the weapon as of late, with everyone stepping up and pitching well. It was bound to happen, as they weren't going to be *that* bad all season.

Gonzo seems pretty confident that his power numbers will come, going as far as promising a HR tonight. Let's hope he can deliver.

Good matchup tonight between two young lefties. Should be some K's tonight. These two faced off once this season, with both pitching poorly. 

Still looking for volunteers to make the Game Threads Friday and Saturday. PM me if you're interested. 



Enjoy the game everyone.

Good evening everyone.

Big night last night. Really great game, and a really fun thread. Most comments we've ever had on a thread in fact. It's nice to talk to you guys every night.

The Sox face another lefty tonight, and where that may have been bad news in years past, the Sox have been crushing lefties this season, including last night. 

Big night for the Celtics tonight, as they can close the series out. I'm sure we'll lose some people to that game, I'll be watching both.

Does anyone actually read these little summaries I write at the bottom?

Enjoy the game everyone.

Good evening everyone.

The Sox are back on the road, which seems like a good thing as they are 1-10 in their last eleven at home. 

Really tough loss yesterday.

Would be nice to see the Sox bounce back tonight.

Enjoy the game everyone.

A taxi driver in Boston, being a huge Sox fan, liked to amuse himself by playing a trick on Yankees fans. Every time he'd see someone wearing Yankees paraphernalia crossing the street, he'd speed towards them like a maniac, only to swerve away at the last minute, scaring the poor pedestrian half to death.

One day, a priest hailed his cab.

""Where are you headed, father?"" the taxi driver asked.

""St. Joseph's, please,"" said the priest, hopping into the taxi.

So the taxi driver was driving along to the destination, when he spotted a man wearing a Yankees hat crossing the street. Completely forgetting about his passenger, he did the usual speed-up-then-swerve stunt. But this time, as he swerved away, he heard a loud THUD.

Terrified he'd hit the man in the cap, he brought the car to a stop, and suddenly remembered the priest in the back seat. He frantically turned to the priest, intending to explain the trick and ask for forgiveness.

""Father! I'm so terribly sorry! Usually I...""

""Don't worry,"" said the priest, ""I got him with the back door.""",,False,self,t5_2qh95,False,,bostonstrong,True,t3_ggdky,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/ggdky/a_red_sox_joke_for_april_fools_day/,

Good afternoon everyone.

Sorry I was absent for yesterday's game, but I'm back today for a day game.

Hopefully the Sox can avoid being swept today, it's been tough to watch them on this homestand after such a great road trip.

Hope you guys join me, enjoy the game everyone!

That way we can take this series against the Orioles, sweep the Yankees, and still go free agent hunting this winter.  So forget about rooting for the O's, root for the Mariners.  And the Padres.  But fuck the Mets.

|

**TL;DR: Down with O's and Yanks; Go M'S!** *(and Padres)*

^^^^^Fuck ^^^^^the ^^^^^Mets

Good afternoon everyone.

I'm putting the thread out *really* early, because right now is the only time I'll be able to submit it. I figured this is better than nothing, and when you guys go to watch the game, this thread will still be available. 

So, most of the information (lineups, etc.) was not available right now, so this thread is quite light on info. But, like I said, better than nothing. 


Enjoy the game, everyone.

Evening everybody.

Big news today as the Sox place Youk on the DL and call up Middlebrooks. Should be cool to finally get to see him play.

I'm not sure if I'll be able to watch this game, but I'm going to do my best. 

Enjoy the thread everyone, hopefully I'll be able to join you all.

Good evening everyone.


Boy is it good to see Youk again. This offense looks very scary right now. They're going to need to find a way to keep all these guys in the lineup. I don't think Gonzo can play the outfield regularly. 

This team is suddenly looking like a playoff team! I'm very excited for the rest of the season. We're going to be very scary come July when Ells and Crawford return.

Let's hop Doubront can continue to build on his solid season tonight. Winning this series would be huge for this team.


Hope you guys join me, enjoy the game everyone!

Hey everyone! Good evening. Time for game three of this four game series in Chicago.

The Sox face a tough pitcher tonight in Peavy, who has pitched like himself of old this season. Hopefully the Sox and their red hot offense can put an end to that.

As always, another great thread last night. I really enjoy my time here with everyone. I love you guys. Hopefully we can make it six straight tonight.

1360981101.0,22,self.redsox,18m7mh,The Boston Red Sox are walking a new path this spring (ESPN Insider),29,7,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/18m7mh/the_boston_red_sox_are_walking_a_new_path_this/,"FORT MYERS, Fla. -- The signs of change in Red Sox camp started on the sidewalk -- damp from Thursday morning showers -- which leads from the players' parking lot to the clubhouse. Somebody who didn't look like John Lackey strolled down that path and then you realized: Wow, that's John Lackey.

He looks so thin, from his offseason regimen, that he could be a body double for Jered Weaver. He looks so thin that Dustin Pedroia, as impolitic and blunt as ever, jokingly asked him if he had contracted a life-threatening disease in the offseason.

But there was more change, when Shane Victorino walked in, filling the room with energy; and one of the guys housed next to Victorino's locker is Jonny Gomes.

Pieces of the greatest change, however, could be seen on the apron of the indoor batting cages, where the Red Sox worked out. Manager John Farrell moved back and forth, breezily talking with his coaches, with players, with front-office personnel. Some of the folks in the organization noted that shift immediately the other day, when Farrell interacted with general manager Ben Cherington. There was a comfort level and a trust that simply was never there last spring, when Bobby Valentine was in the room and Cherington was in his first year on the job with a manager who probably wasn't his first choice.

Pedroia and others have been careful to say, without equivocation, that Boston's shocking 69-win season wasn't Valentine's fault, and that the players are responsible for the pitching and the hitting and the fielding, and in the end, for the victories and defeats. But no matter how they got there, you cannot overstate how dysfunctional the Red Sox were last year -- just as now, you cannot overstate how excited they are to get back to doing what they love to do.

Nobody should overreact to bullpen sessions -- heck, some general managers find them so worthless that they don't even bother watching -- but the word is Lackey is driving the ball down in the strike zone in a way that he hadn't in recent seasons. He feels the difference in his arm, with the extension.

Jon Lester has a good competitive chip on his shoulder, and it shows, some of the Red Sox say. Andrew Bailey is said to be throwing really well here, and the same can be said for Daniel Bard, who has lowered his arm angle slightly, to get back to where he was in 2011.

David Ross caught Junichi Tazawa, who was maybe the best thing that emerged from the wreckage of 2012, and came away in awe of his splitter, thinking that perhaps it is of the same quality thrown by Kevin Brown and Tim Hudson, the two best he has ever caught.

The Red Sox staffers have talked in their conversations about how, in a more stable environment, the team could have a wipeout bullpen, with Tazawa, Bailey and Bard working from the right side in front of closer Joel Hanrahan, and Andrew Miller, Franklin Morales and Craig Breslow working from the left side. Much more production is needed from the rotation, of course, which ranked 27th in ERA last season at 5.19.

But if there is change, it will all start on that sidewalk leading to the spring training clubhouse, because the Red Sox players seem much more enthused about going to work, and their workplace.",,False,self,t5_2qh95,False,,38,True,t3_18m7mh,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/18m7mh/the_boston_red_sox_are_walking_a_new_path_this/,

Hey everyone. It's that time of year again, Red Sox-Yankees for the first time in 2012. On a great occasion as Fenway turns 100! Both teams have had uneven starts, and both are looking to right the ship (more so the Red Sox).

Should be an interesting match-up between Buchholz and Nova, two young righties. 

Another lineup shuffle for the Sox as Sweeney moves up to the 2 hole and Pedroia hits third. This team is desperately missing Ellsbury right now as Repko has been absolutely lost at the plate, batting .111 (not that we expected more). It's just tough having any easy outs in the lineup.

We have to remember that the Sox have had a grueling schedule to start the year, and while they are struggling, most teams would here. We've faced four teams thus far, and all but one were playoff teams, and the other (Toronto) may be the best non-playoff team in the league, besides maybe the Red Sox. Things should get better as the schedule gets easier. 


That's it from me, hope you're having a good day, wherever you are, and I hope you gusy enjoy some day baseball from Fenway!

* Fans are already booing Bobby V and chanting Tito.  

* Fans booed Cody Ross when he lost that pop-up in left.  Great way to thank him for that homerun the other day.

* The pink hats decided to take a break from texting on their iPhones to get up and dance to Sweet Caroline, seemingly oblivious to the fact that we were getting crushed.

* Premium beers cost $8.50  ಠ_ಠ

* As ticket prices have risen, the intensity in Fenway has fallen.  The business crowd has replaced the college crowd.  

* I really don't get the whole ""proposing to your wife at Fenway"" thing...

* Youk is lost out there, no idea what happened to his swing and his plate discipline.

The way I see it, we're stuck with Bobby V and this roster for at least this season.  I'm not sure what good it does to start booing them in mid-April.  Booing your team in mid-April is something that I thought only Yankee fans did, what's happened to us?",,False,self,t5_2qh95,False,,08,True,t3_sfx7b,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/sfx7b/some_thoughts_on_last_nights_blowout/,

Good evening everyone.

Sox look to take the series tonight, with Doubront on the mound. It's certainly been a mixed bag with him thus far, and we've just been unable to gauge him. Is he good enough to stick in the rotation all season and beyond? Doubront looks to start answering those questions tonight.

Aviles is back in the lineup, although he is down in the ninth spot in the lineup, with Sweeney leading off, and Pedey in his comfortable 2 hole. 

Ortiz is back after last night's scare, which is great to see. We cannot afford to lose another offensive cornerstone. I don't want to know where the Sox would be without him or Pedroia.

Indians starter Josh Tomlin was scratched and sent to the DL, with McaAllister called up to start in his place tonight. Hopefully the Sox can handle him like they did Jimenez last night. 

We're up against the Celtics tonight, so I'm guessing we'll be losing some folks to that.

Go Celtics, and go Red Sox!

Enjoy the game everyone.

AT ALL. That ass-hat doesn't represent anything even remotely close to what this city actually stands for.

Its these fair-weather/ bandwagon fans that are showing up out of nowhere and ruining our reputation for the actual real sports fans from Toronto. I'm not wearing my hat or jersey to your park because that asshole had to ruin it for everyone. I just wanted to show up to a great park, watch some good baseball, and talk ball (in a good way) with some rival fans from the east. ridiculous.
/rant.

Now the question: So I'm coming from Toronto to watch the jays and sox this weekend. First time at Fenway and am really looking forward to it. I'll be there for Friday and Saturdays game. Wondering if there's something I must see or do that's baseball oriented? Any great sox-oriented bars to visit for a pre-game pint (or four)? I'm of legal drinking age, have (some) money- so I'd appreciate any help if you could spare some.

Any season ticket holders who want to do a ticket swap if you want to come to Toronto?

Good afternoon everyone.

How is everyone doing?

Good win yesterday, the Sox are really rolling now, would be very nice to see the Sox keep it going with their #5 starter on the mound today.

Weird to see Auto-Out not be an automatic out yesterday, and lead the Sox to a win. That's how you *know* the Sox are hot right now. It seems they may only have to put up with Punto until Tuesday which is when Pedroia is expected to return. Let's all hope it is for good.

No Middlebrooks today, which sucks, but keeping him in the lineup has been tough. Youk has been hitting well since his return from the DL. 

Let's keep ourselves out of last place for good, starting today.





Enjoy the game, everyone.

Good evening everyone.

Wow, the Sox are rolling now, as the starters have all stepped up. Time for Buchholz to try and improve on his best start of the season.

Another Celtics game tonight, so we'll probably lose some people to that (barbie!). Go C's.

The lineup is the same as it normally is against righties, with Sweeney leading off, and Aviles hitting 9th. 

It's time for the Sox to beat a quality opponent and prove they can compete in the AL East. Let's hope they can stretch this win streak to six tonight.  




Enjoy the game everyone.

Good afternoon everyone.

Happy Mother's Day everyone!

Early game today, so I quickly put this together. I'm going to try and watch the game and engage in the discussion, but my participation may be limited.

It's time for us to see what Bard is capable of. The Sox need him to come out and pitch well and keep the momentum going. He pitched well in his last start, but left with two men on, leaving Albers to serve up a 3R shot to Billy Butler. He needs to generate whiffs, and keep the pitch count down. Hopefully he follows in Doubront's footsteps today.

Lineup is the same as yesterday, hopefully the Sox can generate some runs early to give Bard a cushion so he can attack the strike zone. Pedroia is looking to extend his 13-game hitting streak today, as he is red hot



Enjoy the game everyone.

Hey everyone, I was absent yesterday once again, but I'm back today. I probably will miss some of the game, as I may be quite busy, but I'll pop in when I can. This is a nice thing to see as a Sox fan, three straight wins, and the division is pretty much even now, as the Rays limp into today's game on a four game skid. 

Should be interesting to see how the injuries play out here, as getting Crawford back ASAP would be great for the lineup that now lacks a speedster. Still waiting to hear concrete news on Ellsbury on whether it's going to be 4-8 weeks or much longer. I have my fingers crossed.

I hope everyone is having a good day, enjoy the early baseball!",,False,self,t5_2qh95,False,,15,True,t3_sccxo,http://www.reddit.com/r/redsox/comments/sccxo/game_thread_red_sox_45_vs_rays_45_1105am_game_10/,

Get a stern coach, after having a players coach you have to go hard.

Sign Pinella or Valentine for 3-4 years

Then send Varitek down to double AA for experience. Once the new coach's contract runs out, we bring 'tek up and do work.

It's amazing to me how the Os fans are treating their team like a dynasty after ONE winning season and ONE playoff appearance. After last seasons misery they treat the Red Sox like they are the Chicago Cubs, Charlotte Bobcats, or any team that would be the worst in their respective sport. After David Ortiz's meltdown they act like he is Aaron Hernandez and should be executed. Maybe I am just being protective of my team but Os fans are just ridiculous for the most part.
