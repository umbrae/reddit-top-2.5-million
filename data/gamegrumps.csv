1374789287.0,2197,self.gamegrumps,1j21po,Thank You All.,3598,1401,619,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1j21po/thank_you_all/,"My view on creative content is that the work speaks for itself. If something is bad or good, the only reason it's bad or good is because it's bad or good. It was never my intent to come out and tell people they should ""give it a chance"" or ""enjoy it for what it is."" People react how they react and I have no interest in telling people that they shouldn't. It's hard to bite my tongue and let people be people, but it is for the best in my opinion. This community is strong because of its creative freedom. I appreciate it, but don't moderate it, and it becomes its own source of joy independent of the show as a result.

I am having an insanely good time with Danny. He demands of me so much and brings me to my limits. His incredible work ethic, his comedy experience, and his positive attitude have already made me a better person. I honestly couldn't have asked for a better partner and friend to do this show with. He has an appreciation for and a commitment to the show that makes me feel like I'm a lazy asshole.

I'm so grateful you all have accepted this ""New Grumps"" in spite of all the sudden change. I understand how frustrating it may have been to experience all the change at once and I'm truly sorry to have caused any grief. We are doing the best we can to continue to put on a good show, because really, that's all we can do. I'm not very good at quelling drama or saying reassuring things. I'm only good at making a good show, so that's what I wanted to do. The entire Grump team has been amazing in the past month and they've been working so hard to not only improve how the show is made, but also to create new things that we're super excited about. We've never worked so hard on the show before, and we don't intend to stop.

So... thank you guys for being so cool, and understanding, and supportive, and creative, and loving, and wonderful. You make working on Grumps a complete joy, and we honestly couldn't do it without you. 

As a PS... If you'll allow me to address a couple things directly while I have the stage, I'd be super grateful:

I want everyone to be assured that I'm always working. My personal life suffers from it sometimes, perhaps, but I'm always creating new things. Game Grumps has become a huge focus in my life, but as many have stated before, it's no excuse to be lazy when it demands relatively little time of me. New cartoons or shows on Egoraptor have been slow because I've been busting my balls since the release of ""Console vs PC"" working on a huge project that I'm aching to show everybody. I've never put so much into a single project in my life... it's huge. The one thing I'm superstitious about is announcing details about WIP projects, but I've trickled out a lot of hints about what it is over the past couple months. All of the hints are connected... they are part of one big massive project. I won't drop a date until I know for sure everything can get finished before then.

Thanks again, and keep being awesome! :)",,False,self,t5_2ulfu,False,,egoraptorspecial,True,t3_1j21po,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1j21po/thank_you_all/,

Hey Everybody,

   I just wanted to write you all a quick note to say Happy Grumpiversary (sp?) and share my appreciation for what you do.  When I came on board the show a month ago I knew it was going to be a wild ride.  What I was not prepared for was the outpouring of love and support from you guys, as well as the intense passion you display for Game Grumps on a daily basis.  

   All the emails and messages I've received from the fan base mean a lot to me (even if I can't manage to answer them all).  Jon is my friend as well as a unique talent, and I didn't want to try to replace exactly what he brought to the show because we're different people and it would have come across as fake.  All I could do was be myself, and the fact that you have been so accepting of me under those circumstances feels really great.  

   Anyway, that's it.  I'm looking forward to having fun and playing video games with you and the Grump family for a long time.  I'll drop in here from time to time to say hello.  Until then, just know that I think you're all great, and have definitely lived up to the name ""Lovelies!""

Sincerely (totally!)
Danny

Thanks for sending so many games. You guys have singlehandedly assured we will never stop running out of material. We've played games we didn't even know existed, and that, I feel, is the coolest thing about the PO Box.

That being said, we receive a lot of the same games a lot of the time. Many of you have expressed in letters that it was hard to give these games away, or it's your favorite, or something else that makes us feel like terrible people for taking your games, so we've compiled a frequently updated list of the games in our library. If you have the idea to send us a game, check to see if we have it, and maybe you won't have to part with your beloved copy of Glover with your named scrawled on the back! All those memories... rushing back... Flicking balls...

SO, if there's a game we don't have that you want us to have and consider playing on the show, send it to:

Game Grumps
PO Box 3770
Glendale, CA
91221 USA

Include your name so we can thank you on the show! If your name is buttwizard that's fine. 

Additionally, we cannot send games back, so if there's something you really can't part with, don't part with it! We won't hate you for it (unless you're a dick to your mom. Then we'll judge you maybe a little. I mean Jesus, she's your mom).

If you are sending something to have it signed, hold on to it! We will be making tons of appearances in the future. Don't you want to watch us sign it? And then high five? You can't high five through the mail. Believe me I've tried.

All of the doubles we've received up to this point will be auctioned off for charity! We will make an announcement when this is happening, and we might throw in some exclusive stuff in the lots, too. ;)

Thanks again for all the love! We certainly wouldn't be able to do the show without your overwhelming support. And your beautiful eyes. God, I could stare into them for hours. Have you been working out?

Love,

The Grumps

You all should be ashamed of yourselves, seriously.

Constantly posting the same damn quotes from their videos isn't funny.

Arin and Danny are probably so sick of these posts with only the word ""mycaruba"".

Ross is probably getting fed up with the whole 'is rly good' thing.

Unanimously, I think we can agree that posts containing only a few letters should be deleted.

Enough with the Arin drama already,637,122,212,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/15u1ac/real_talk_enough_with_the_arin_drama_already/,"Ok, seriously this is getting a bit much for me. I know reddit loves drama, but enough with the Arin bashing. I've seen this on the odd occasion, where people aren't happy with Arin being the more vocal of the grumps and seeming to ""bully"" Jon. But he's not, he's just being Arin and talking with a good friend. What confuses me is people seem to think that Arin being loud and abrasive is a new thing. Have you ever watched any of his interviews or shorts? There have always been moments where he seems to ""fly off the handle"" because he's passionate about something.

I think the reason so many people are up in arms lately is because a lot of us can relate more to Jon. He has a much more ""everyman"" kind of personality, which makes it easier to relate to him. And maybe because of this, people are associating Arin's banter or critiques as attacks. But they're not, its just debates between friends. If you have a really good friend, you can be loud and blunt about how you feel, because they'll know what you're saying and what you're not saying. And regardless, we have no right to judge their friendship. If Arin and Jon have problems, they'll talk about it. We don't need to judge and yell about something so stupid.

TL/DR: Shut up with the Arin drama already!

Edit: Obligatory ""Holy shit front page"" comment. I seriously didn't expect my little rant to do anything other than get buried. Anyways, now that I'm not on my lunch break, I should explain my thoughts a little better. For one thing, I know I directed this at Reddit, but honestly I should have directed it at the fanbase in general. Still, there is a lot of overlap between sites, and I've seen plenty of snarky comments here and there.

When I said Jon was the ""everyman"" I meant it in the typical gamer nerd fashion: quiet, laid back, and enjoys a game because of how it feels without any specific reasoning. Hell he's said numerous times that DK games just feel right, and he doesn't know why. Arin's very analytical, and often looks at the technical aspects of games beyond most people. I mean, just look at Sequelitis. Now that's not saying either one is ""better"" than the other at being a Grump.. They're just different. I relate more to Jon, and I have a friend who's very much like Arin. Guess what? Our discussions about games are almost identical to the Grumps.

Regardless, I'm not going to make this post any longer than the wall it already is. Thanks for being level headed, Grumpit.",,False,self,t5_2ulfu,1357170380.0,,Poppysr,True,t3_15u1ac,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/15u1ac/real_talk_enough_with_the_arin_drama_already/,

People are criticizing and downvoting it in the first place because they want to see the content improve and help Jon and Arin learn from their mistakes. Even if they don't read the youtube comments directly, word of mouth can carry the message and they'll still learn about it in some other way.

What fans don't realize when they tell people things like ""don't like, don't watch"" is that the people criticizing the show WANT to watch it. This type of attitude that drove me away from fandoms like TGWTG because the crazy fans who liked everything drove away the more rational ones who have more valid things to say. Apparently, leaving criticism because you want to see things improve makes you as a traitor to the fandom and you're not welcome.

&gt;I'm happy to announce that Egoraptor is currently very happy.

&gt;Today I will wrap up a long awaited production that has spanned nearly an entire year. Should it have taken that long? Hell no. But the production itself has been a personal journey. How personal could a 3 minute cartoon about video game monsters yelling at each other be? Very.

&gt;In the time from MAGFest to now I have reworked many aspects of the cartoon because they were lacking. I'm very very happy with it now. It will be ready today and once everything is double and triple checked, I'll release it. Woo.

&gt;That's not entirely why I'm happy though. I'm happy because this journey has taught me a lot about what it means to be me. And what makes me, me, is to create. I'm working on cartoons. Too many. But I've learned my lesson. One step at a time. I'm already hard at work on another cartoon, and it will be finished soon as well. I am cursed when I announce specifics so I will continue to refrain from it, but just know I am MAKING CARTOONS.

Some of the funniest moments in Game Grumps have been the crazy characters they come up with. From Fucking Larry to Mike Aruba and Sad Hoshi, I always love it when they make personalities.

Imagine them trying to live Sad Hoshi's everyday life in The Sims, and they could make up some absurd new cast for the family. Or they could play it like FTL where they make Sim versions of themselves and take turns controlling each other.

It could be like what Animal Crossing might've been with them coming up with characters for the neighbors, but the recent Sims games has more day-to-day gameplay objectives to hopefully keep them from dropping it.",,False,self,t5_2ulfu,False,,,True,t3_1jb4dn,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1jb4dn/idea_for_the_next_great_steam_train_robbery/,

1370548972.0,395,self.gamegrumps,1ftaie,"Some helpful tips for Jon and Arin playing Stretch Panic [Please Read This, Jon &amp; Arin] (WARNING: HUGE WALLS OF TEXT)",459,64,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1ftaie/some_helpful_tips_for_jon_and_arin_playing/," Hey, I've played through Stretch Panic recently, and I've realized that this game has some badly explained or never explained features and tricks, one of which is actually *needed to beat it*. I'd like to pass along a few tips &amp; tricks to the grumps, assuming they even read this, so they can actually beat this game and not let it fester as an incomplete series. This game deserves the limelight for once. So here you go:

 1. Abilities that the gosh-darn game never tells you about:

 -1a: The instant stretch-jump: Just grab onto any terrain and press R3 (click down the right analog stick or press whatever button it may be for you), and you'll do the charged eye-meter jump instantly. You can't attack with it, but it makes moving around much easier.

 -1b: The Scarf/Smart Bomb, A.K.A. the Exorcism attack (Costs 5 points, prepare to see the boob ladies often for points) (**YOU NEED TO USE THIS ABILITY TO BEAT THE GAME**): This ability is never detailed anywhere in-game, and is needed to actually beat each boss. To do it, you need to grab onto a boss and then press L3 and R3 at the same time. This makes two mini-scarves appear and latch onto the enemy. Once they both attach (and not before), wiggle both sticks like mad and you'll do massive damage. Using this power properly and at the right time on a boss exorcises the demon (a floating head with wings that will follow you for the rest of the fight) from them and makes them return to being human when beaten, rather than just disappear. You MUST exorcise each sister to truly defeat them. Also, each boss has their own proper timing and location on them to attack with the Scarf/Smart Bomb, so you have to be careful with it.


 2. Boss strategies (O means the Grumps have gotten to this boss, X means they haven't):

 O-*Siren* (singing songstress) (long description since she seems to be big trouble for the Grumps): The fight that is the bane of the Grumps. Wait until she sings, then yank the little piplup/oshawott hybrids off of her dress before she stops singing. (I recommend targeting Siren, strafing around her, and holding down on the right stick while hitting the grab button each time you pass one of the little buggers.) They won't get back on if you so much as grab them once, so just drop them once you have one and move on to the next. If you do it right, Siren gets pissed and starts flailing her arms around while closing the spinning sphere to transform. However, she isn't bright and manages to get her arms **slammed in the closing sphere-mouth**, inflicting massive damage and preventing her from transforming. Also, make sure to exorcise her as soon as the fight begins, you can do it as long as she is in the singing form.


 O-*Cinder* (giant-headed flame-belcher): This fight is pretty simple. When Cinder opens her big, fat mouth, grab the uvula and yank it (don't fly at it, just let go of it after yanking) to stun her. Not much to say with this one, you can exorcise her at any time in my experience, but try to do it when she's stunned for the best results.


 O-*Spinner* (whirlybird thing that flies around): This one is a bit easy, but annoying if you don't know what to do. Stretch either the ball or the head when she spins around and let go to stun her, then stretch Spinner herself and let go to do huge damage. Exorcise her when she's stunned.


 O-*Miss Mecca* (giant robot): Piece of cake. Pull on her until the eye-meter fills and launch yourself into her to stun her (it's a bit hit-and-miss). Stretch her and let go for massive damage when stunned, and/or exorcise her then.


 X-*Anne-Droid V2.1* (flying robo-lady on the moon): Hoo boy, this fight is a pain. Exorcise her when the fight starts, and stretch her body &amp; let go to do tons of damage by slingshotting her away. The problem here is finding her, she's a pain in the ass to keep an eye on due to the Super Mario Galaxy-style level. Also, the little TV-heads will try and zap you, ignore and avoid them if you can.


 X-*Fay Soff* (giant mutant Ms. Potato Head): This fight is fun, just slam into her to knock the pieces of her face off, then put them back on in weird ways. She gets embarrassed, and if you slam into her again she'll take a ton of damage. Exorcise her when she's stunned (embarrassed), the usual.


 X-*Samantha* (dark Linda with a fish-head on a chain): Remember all the various Shadow Link fights from the Zelda series? This is Stretch Panic's silly version of that. Easy fight though. Samantha will attack with the fish-head, saying ""Here it comes!"" every time. When she does, try and stand near one of the balls so she'll pick it up, and then dodge it when she throws it at you. Once she does, the chain she holds the fish with will be grab-able, grab it and snap it to send her careening face first into a metal or flaming ball. This stuns her so badly she **spews chunks** for a couple of seconds, allowing you to stretch &amp; snap her directly, or exorcise her.


 X-*Jelly-Chan* (blob with a face): Probably the easiest fight in the game. Exorcise her when the fight starts, Slam into her over and over again until she goes down. Impossible to screw up.


 X-*Cyan* (4-armed alien): Annoying fight, right here. Cyan starts off being completely invincible. Avoid her attacks and grab &amp; release any of the little troopers that get hit by her. If they grab onto one of her arms, she'll fling them onto wall, and you'll have to pull them off. Why do you care about these little guys? Because, if all of them fire on her at once with no downed troopers missing out, she'll glow white and become vulnerable to attack. Exorcise her when this happens, and stretch her and release to do huge damage at this time after the initial exorcism.


 X-*Mirage* (Egyptian queen): Easy fight all in all. Exorcise her right when the fight starts. Then just stick near the somewhat annoying to find water puddles and lead her to them when she does her sand tornado attack. She'll suck up the water and the tornado will turn to solid mud. Then just stretch &amp; snap her for massive damage.


 ^(Fun fact: Mirage uses the same ""DAMN IT"" sound clip as Siren if you attack her with a low damage attack while she is flying around and not attacking.)


 X-*Demonica* (serial killer trying to get inside to... *greet* you): Demonica makes Anne's fight look like Jelly's in terms of difficulty. This is the only boss you literally cannot directly see and fight, having to snap various doors instead to hit her indirectly. Actually seeing her directly is instant death, which happens if she manages to break into the room, with a wonderful little cutscene to show you just how boned you truly are. The only way to tell where she's going is to listen to the sound of her walking or beating on a door, and watching her silhouette outside the windows. When she beats on a door or trapdoor, snap it back at her to hurt her. When she goes to the rainbow-y screen-door that you can see shadows through, **run to whichever one she is at and snap it FAST, or you will die!** If the rainbow-door you're looking at has a huge silhouette of a monster, snap it. If it's a silhouette of a hanging woman, turn around and run for the other door as fast as you can. Also, some of the doors spit out minions, ignore them if you want any chance of winning. In order to exorcise this appropriately-named demon, use the Scarf/Smart Bomb on the big wooden door with metal locks when she bangs on it.


 ^(Fun fact: Demonica is the only boss that can instantly kill you if you fail to do something properly, and Demonica's the only one with a special cutscene when you die.)


 X-*Spirit* (final boss, unlocked when all other sisters have been exorcised properly and beaten): This is the last fight, get all seven of your asses ready and puckered. Spirit is, as her name implies, a ghostly princess/dancer girl with demonic-looking gloves. You have to attack the gloves, as the rest of her body is untouchable. Exorcise her as fast as you can, which is easier said than done since the small target makes latching on with the mini-hands a pain in the ass. I recommend grinding for a ton of points in EX stages (get enough to do like 5-6 scarf bombs (25-30 points), as they're the most effective attack in the game), then entering the fight. Keep scarf-bombing her hands, while trying not to get grabbed and snapping the eye-turrets to break them. 


Once you beat Spirit, the game is over and all the lovelies can go back to complaining about the existence and/or nonexistence of Sonic 06 Part 937. I hope this helps you Grumps, as I'd love to see you guys beat this game fully and help it get some much-needed attention. Also, the boss music is SO GOOD, and you just gotta hear it. Best of luck to you.

1354651123.0,395,self.gamegrumps,14a0b2,Thank you.,441,46,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/14a0b2/thank_you/,"As almost all of you guys know, [Barry did an AMA a few days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/145zih/hi_im_barry_i_edit_game_grumps_ask_me_anything/). I think this is a huge milestone for the subreddit and can't help to be thankful to everyone for being on their best behaviour and having helping everything go smoothly. I'm just going to blabber about how awesome everyone is.

I seriously can't believe this sub has come this far. I remember creating this subreddit quickly before hopping onto CoD 4 with my friends. I expected to get about 100 active users at most on here but now, at the time of writing this, we're over 13,000 members! 13,000!!! It's just mind blowing for me to see this place blow up. Over the past 4 months we've received multiple shout outs from the grumps themselves, an AMA with the freaking editor of the show, the domain www.gamegrumps.com, a ton of user flair courtesy of /u/xandan and /u/slyphoria, an awesome bot that posts videos thanks to /u/AndrewNeo and some pimpin' CSS goodies like the header from /u/Steel_Ninja.

I'm extremely grateful to everyone for submitting, voting and commenting all over this subreddit. If I could high five everyone on this sub, I would.

Thank you to all the mods for their time and effort over the past few months and for the (hopefully!) many more to come!

Thank you Barry for editing the show, interacting with the community and for doing the AMA.

And thank you Arin and Jon, for being grump and not so grump.

Here's to the next 13,000 members! :D

But to those of you saying we should stop ... It hasn't even been an hour yet since we've found out.

Let me relay that, In the span of LESS THAN 2 HOURS we find out Jon HAS LEFT GAME GRUMPS and given almost NO TIME TO REACT TO THAT, we are shown an episode with him ALREADY REPLACED BY DANNY. That's like finding out your parents left one another and then mom's new husband moving in within HOURS of being told! You'd freak out too!

I think the negative reactions to this change are not surprising in the least.

I don't want to say that Danny wouldn't make a good grump, but for Pete's sake I would have waited a least A DAY before the new guy moved in... dropping everything on us at once and giving us shit for saying it's heavy.

1363969680.0,351,self.gamegrumps,1at178,Steam Key giveaway (65 games),453,102,183,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1at178/steam_key_giveaway_65_games/,"Hello lovelies/cumfaggots,

I tried to do a giveaway on /r/gaming, but my post was deleted because giveaways were not allowed there. The mod suggested I go to /r/PlayItForward or /r/RandomActsOfGaming, but I thought my 2nd favorite subreddit would like some games. I know this has nothing to do with Arin, Jon or GameGrumps, but this subreddit is still related to games.

ANYWAY, here is my original post, I'll see soon enough if you want me to do the giveaway or not through upvotes/downvotes/deletion:

Over the years I've been collecting a lot of Steam games, but with all these bundles lately I've gotten so many double games that I decided to give them away. I have 65 keys of various games, some crap, some good, mostly indie, a few 'bigger' games.

Now I have heard about bots scanning posts for keys, and I have no idea if that's actually true, but I decided to make it a kind of game. When this post reaches the front page of /r/gamegrumps, or has a whole lot of upvotes (this is a selfpost I believe, so I don't get any of the karma myself, it's just for visibility), I will update this post with the announcement that within X amount of time, all the keys with their ""puzzle"", some more difficult then others, mostly video game/television/film related, will be posted.

This is an example of what it would look like (the key actually works):

[EXAMPLE](http://i.imgur.com/OVb0l3K.png)

They will be posted as images, because formatting this much stuff in a reddit post is hell.

Almost forgot to say an important thing, the reason why I don't want to immediately post all of the keys is that this might just be downvoted into oblivion with only a few people redeeming a shitload of keys.

EDIT: Since it turns out it's not that hard to get to the GameGrumps frontpage, I'll just announce it now: I will post the images with the keys and clues 6 hours from now. That's when the GameGrumps upload their second episode of the day if I'm correct. So yeah, plenty of time for more people to see it!

EDIT 2: A hint of the games in the bundle: A humble Indie bundle or two, Making History: The Calm &amp; The Storm, Ironclads, Razor 2, Commandos, and some bigger games like Just Cause 2, Hitman: Blood Money and Fallout 3

EDIT 3: Miscalculation in edit 1, the keys will be posted ONE HOUR after the second gamegrumps episode airs today. They will be added with an edit to this post!

EDIT 4: (These edits are getting out of hand lol), I've got another example to clarify some more. The one I posted before is ""easy"", because there is only one hint. Now, with [THIS ONE](http://i.imgur.com/pAcEhdf.png) it is a bit different, there are two hints/questions/clues/thingies. Just remember that they are always in order from top to bottom, as you can see with the corresponding numbers, there are two letters missing in the first word, and 1 in the second. That means that the first letter from the first word is first, then the second letter, and then the first letter from the second word. Anyway, this code should actually work too! I hope I explained it well enough.

EDIT 5: I just went through the list and placed a light blue dot above games that are Linux compatible and a purple dot above games that are Mac compatible. Not a whole lot are, but at least it's clear!

EDIT 6: For the people that are still here, I DID NOT DELETE THE THREAD. It was Steel_Ninja. I've contacted the other mods but no reply so far.

EDIT 7: RIGHT, we're back, Steel_Ninja has had his [power trip](http://i232.photobucket.com/albums/ee41/skaught78/forummod-1.jpg) for the day, 59 minutes to go.

EDIT 8: Reddit was down for me, so five minutes late, but [HERE WE GO](http://i.imgur.com/Bpdz6ST.png)!!

EDIT 9: All keys must be gone by now. I hope everybody enjoys the games they got, I might do this again some day!",,False,self,t5_2ulfu,1365952109.0,,GreenLinkNES,True,t3_1at178,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1at178/steam_key_giveaway_65_games/,

***Why not turn those extra copies into something positive for the gaming community's youngest and newest members?***

Arin, Jon, and Barry could sign the game cartridges (individually or in a bulk sale) and put them up on ebay for lovelies to bid on.Then the proceeds from the game sales could be donated to [**Child's Play**](http://www.childsplaycharity.org/).

I'm sure most of you already know this, but Child's Play is a charity that actively works to make the time kids spend at hospitals less painful/scary, and more like home by purchasing gaming systems &amp; toys for children's wards at hospitals nation-wide.

Yes granted, the Grumps could just donate said extra games to Child's Play, but I'd be dang-sure willing to bet the sales of the signed carts would be much more useful in the long-run.

***If you agree/think this is a great idea for charity, PLEASE upvote this post to help get Arin/Jon/Barry's eyes on the idea! This is a text submission, which means I get no karma from your upvotes, this post is strictly to get the charity idea in front of Team Grump.***

There's an great chance here to really give back &amp; do something awesome for kids across the country- let's not let those carts go to waste; instead lets turn them into smiles on the faces of sick kids.

1372400477.0,290,self.gamegrumps,1h8fgu,This is a serious time in Jon's life,354,64,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1h8fgu/this_is_a_serious_time_in_jons_life/,"There's a couple points that I think haven't been addressed in all the discussion and rumors about Jon's departure.

No matter what is happening, it's a serious time for him.  I'm in a creative field, and I know what it's like to feel burnt out, uninspired, unfulfilled, or unable to focus, even it's just from something that's four hours a week.  Call it depression, creative block, whatever, I'm sure most of us have felt that.

There's a lot of focus on how it should have been handled better, and we're being kept out of the dark.  It seems fishy in all the cases I've seen discussed - moving, just focusing on JonTron, a falling out and making up with Arin, loss of creative control, otherwise being pushed out.  'Why couldn't they have done the transition better or at least give us an update by now?'

No matter what, maybe even John have an explanation.  Often we make decisions that we feel are right before we understand why.  He may need time to piece it all together.

The other point I want to suggest and question I want to pose is why couldn't this be a much more serious time in Jon's life?  He prides himself on his transparency, yet this is something he won't clarify.  So unless this is leading up to a worthwhile joke, which would have to be the best joke ever, it's serious enough to keep private.

What if it's something medical?  What if it's something going on in his family?  Or just as one example, he's mentioned drinking a lot and even wanting to stop.  What if it was worse than we thought and he went to a rehab program?  How many people would want to talk about that to people they know, let alone The Entire Internet?  And all of those are types of things that would keep his closest friends quiet out of respect.

As for it being sudden to us, it may very well have been sudden to them.  Yes, they did schedule things and say regular two-a-day-Grumps would be back on a certain date, so it seems like they would have had time to do it better.  But when a friend has a life changing event - a medical situation/ injury, a death in the family, you don't ask them to go into work, do you a favor, or especially get on camera and explain it unless they're 100% ready for it on their own.

I'm not trying to make excuses, I'm sad and want to know what's going on as bad as everyone else does.  But I think Jon and the crew will explain it when they're good and ready.  They don't need to hear our whining, complaining, and suspicions about their personal lives.  

He's still Jon.  Let's treat him like our buddy who needs our love and support right now.


tl;dr  Imagine all the things that would be too serious, personal, and/ or sudden to talk about, then assume Jon is going through one of those right now.  He's our buddy.",,False,self,t5_2ulfu,False,,,True,t3_1h8fgu,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1h8fgu/this_is_a_serious_time_in_jons_life/,

I...uh...guess you sorta...heard the news...and can observe how crazy things are at the moment.
Well, to contain all the confusion and panic, we've decided to change the subreddit to approved submitters. We're sorry about this but it's our best bet to help calm everyone. The /u/groompbot will continue to submit episodes and you'll be able to discuss them in episode threads.

Please keep all discussion of Jon leaving in the [current top thread on this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1h1tsu/jon_has_left_game_grumps/).

And let's keep all Steam Train discussion to the [video thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1h2eyr/welcome_to_steam_train/) please.

Again, we apologise for the inconvenience caused by this but this entire thing is as much as a shock to us as it is to you.
