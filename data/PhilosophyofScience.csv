I've been thinking about the common image of The Scientist: they are Einstein-writ-large, self-critical, self-effacing, brilliant, willing to listen to contrary views, etc. You'll hear that from most scientists today, and I'll take them at their word: many scientists are, or at least think they are, paragons of virtue. Our first kind of scientist is then the *self-critical scientist*: they've thought of -- and addressed -- all the objections long before they've decided to publish, refined their ideas over time, etc.

From here, the collective actions of The Scientists produce a self-critical community of capital-'s'-Science: the self-critical whole is the sum of its self-critical parts. This is close to what Popper had in mind, and sadly, I don't think it exists.

**II.**

Of course, there's been a more recent depiction of The Scientist as aggressive, dogmatic, indifferent to contrary views, that came out of Kuhn's work in the 60's. This is our second kind of scientist: *the dogmatic scientist*: they've come up with a brilliant idea, but will never change. 

This too leads to a community of dogmatists, where change can occur only when the Old Guard dies. But what if a self-critical community can be an emergent property from a collection of dogmatic scientists?

I don't know if that's possible. In fact, it looks to be *by definition* impossible: even if all the evidence should indicate otherwise, no dogmatic scientist will stop working on his pet theory. Science, then, would mirror the Christian church's long history of schisms; scientific 'progress' would be little more than competing fads; any test of a theory would be irrelevant. Or, instead of constant schisms, there might be a hegemonic authority, where everyone tows the party line. Either option would be unwelcome.

**III.**

However, if a handful of even the mostly remotely non-dogmatic scientists continue to publish, there would be progress: they would treat hard-hitting criticism *qua* criticism, and will eventually adjust their views, etc. There's no need for self-criticism: this third kind of scientist requires only doubt. Our third kind of scientist, then, is *the doubting scientist*: even if they don't take the time to critically evaluate their own theories, they're willing to listen (somewhat) to others. 

There's only so many criticisms people can take before they acknowledge that they've made a mistake. Luckily, scientists are quite happy to criticize their comrades. And of course, scientists are like the rest of us: most of them understand that they make mistakes. Rather than being self-critical or dogmatic, *scientists need only doubt*. The collective actions of a doubting community produces a self-critical whole.",,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,,True,t3_ge9d2,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/ge9d2/if_i_were_wrong_one_would_be_enough_albert/,

Just think: [three months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/d8xxa/philosophyofscience_reddit_reaches_5000_users_in/) we celebrated reaching 5,000 members! My, how we've grown! [Eleven months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/related/am2cz/philosophyofscience_subreddit_reaches_1000_users/) we were resting on our laurels after reaching 1,000!

For those who don't know, last year, we held [a short contest with a few submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/acgvi/phil_of_sci_subreddit_the_free_book_contest_dec_8/). The winners received two books: ""[Gödel's Theorem: An Incomplete Guide to Its Use and Misuse](http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6dels-Theorem-Incomplete-Guide-Abuse/dp/1568812388/)"", by Torken Franzen (from sixbillionthsheep) and both volumes of ""[The Open Society and Its Enemies](http://www.amazon.com/Open-Society-its-Enemies-Routledge/dp/0415290627/)"", by Karl Popper (from me).

Since we've reached this milestone, it's time we hold another contest. 

Actually ... sixbillionthsheep and I have decided to up the ante and now hold *two* -- count them -- *two* contests, so stay tuned for sixbillionthsheep's contest!

---------

Some preliminary remarks: I've been in touch with the philosopher of science [David Miller](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/people/associates/miller/), and at his suggestion one essay question is as follows:

---------


&gt;**""Has the Naturalistic Approach to the Philosophy of Science Shed Any Light on Its Central Problems?""**


-------

The rules of the contest? NO RULES. Everything is open ... but everything comes at a cost:

1. Remember: there's no word limit or word minimum, but the more thought put into an essay, the better chance you have at winning.

2. Please cite your sources. If it's clear that you're just ripping off someone else (or just blatantly stealing papers) without giving some credit, no prize for you.

3. How do you submit? Just leave it as a comment on this page. You can either make a self-post elsewhere and link back to it, leave a comment-size paper, or make a .pdf or .txt file and link to it in the comment. You can also post a link to your blog, your hog, or you log.

4. Extra points will be arbitrarily given by the secret judges for tough criticisms of other people's papers and extra-extra points will be given for powerful defenses of your position. Double-extra secret points will be awarded for use of the secret word of the day. Imaginary points will also be factored, as well as nontraditional grading through the use of tarot cards and a 20-sided die. Papers that do not win but effectively integrate into the paper philosophically-themed puns, riddles, or word games will win a booby prize (TBA). (If you produce a film of you striking a bust or statue of a famous philosopher or scientist squarely with a ping-pong ball from at least six feet, your essay will be given special consideration. Writing a song will help. Remember: NO RULES.)

5. After we've received a large enough number of submissions, I'll start giving a countdown of the number of days remaining before I end the contest. But don't worry: all you college kids out there have plenty of time to write something up in the span of a few weeks.

Oh ... and another thing:

I'm giving one other possible way to compete in the contest. Give your most novel answer to the problem facing William K. Clifford's Principle, which states “It is wrong always, everywhere and for anyone to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.” The problem is as follows:

----------

&gt;**What sufficient evidence is there for Clifford's Principle?** Would it not be wrong, always, everywhere and for anyone to believe Clifford's Principle without sufficient evidence? And what of the justification of this sufficient evidence? And what of the justification of *that* sufficient evidence ... In short, **resolve the regress the best you can!**

---------

Now on the prizes: the winner of the contest (and possibly the runner-up?) will receive at no cost to them, delivered straight to their door, the choice of one of the three following books:

1. ""[Popper Selections](http://www.amazon.com/Popper-Selections-Sir-Karl-Raimund/dp/0691020310)"", edited by one of the greatest Critical Rationalists out there ... David Miller!

2. ""[Elementary Logic](http://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Logic-W-V-Quine/dp/0674244516/)"" (revised edition), by one of the most influential analytic philosophers from Ohio ever ... Willard Van Orman Quine!

3. ""[The History of Western Philosophy](http://www.amazon.com/History-Western-Philosophy-Bertrand-Russell/dp/0671201581/)"", by one of the most famous philosophers that ever drank tea in prison ... Bertrand Russell!

---------

ALSO, everyone that participates in this contest in good faith (subject to moderator's discretion) will receive a **SECRET SELECTION OF FREE EBOOKS** on the philosophy of science!

Oh, and as of this writing, we now have over 1,000 posts!

The first, Werner (Jimmy) De Pauli you [have been introduced to]( http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/c2lke/kurt_goedels_mathematically_plausible_time_travel/). The other gentleman was [Eckehart Koehler](http://imgur.com/6Xrvl.jpg). Professor Koehler is like a walking philosophy of science encyclopedia - only better dressed and far more interesting. He generously walked a friend and me around the busts in the University of Vienna courtyard and had a stunning knowledge of all of them. He saved the best till last - the place where [Moritz Schlick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Schlick) was assassinated. Schlick was not only the founder of the [logical positivism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism) movement, he was the teacher and mentor of Kurt Goedel and inspired him to start studying mathematical logic. [Goedel's brother believed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del#cite_note-Casti2001-5) that it was Schlick’s assassination that caused Goedel’s subsequent paranoia and nervous breakdown.

---

The official story has always been that Schlick was assassinated by a ""crazed"" student but Eckehart Koehler has long had a more intriguing theory. He believes that while the trigger was indeed pulled by [Johann Nelboeck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Nelb%C3%B6ck), the real inspiration behind the killing was another academic, [Leo Gabriel](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Gabriel_(Philosoph) who believed Schlick had unfairly hindered his career advancement. Gabriel allegedly fed stories to Nelboeck, already known to be unstable, about a (false) Schlick conspiracy to have Nelboeck dismissed from his teaching position at a Vienna school. The death threats Schlick had received from Nelboeck whose girlfriend he believed was having an affair with Schlick were widely known at the time.

Eckehart Koehler wrote a paper in 1968 supporting his theory about Schlick's assassination which he kindly gave me an English translation of. I was left utterly gobsmacked by the audacity of the claims, which due to largely political and legal reasons never saw light of day until 2000 at a History of Philosophy of Science conference. The paper includes written testimony of former students and academics about Gabriel and his involvement. It also includes a written denial by Gabriel himself.  As far as I know, the paper has never been published in a public journal so I asked Eckehart Koehler if I could make it available to readers of this subreddit, and he generously agreed.

**So, put down that textbook you're reading and take a fascinating walk into the not-so-distant history of mathematics, science and philosophy by reading Eckehart Koehler's thoroughly fascinating and highly charged account called [""Philosophy of Misdeed"" available here](http://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=17fw9kWBZKGsv16cu7MdoCkRaeItw-BI-W6CyRUiWAxY&amp;hl=en)**.

If you have any questions for Professor Koehler, let me know and I will try to persuade him to read his email in a timely fashion. ;) In the mean time, below are some photos I made while he was showing us around.

[Here is a plaque in the walkway]( http://imgur.com/ObALI.jpg) up to the philosophy department at the University of Vienna commemorating the spot where Schlick was shot. The plaque reads in English :

Logician [Harvey Friedman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Friedman) (who by the way is in the Guinness Book of Records for being the world's youngest professor) recently constructed a [set of somewhat ""tame"" arithmetic statements](http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/~friedman/pdf/UnprovThms052605.pdf) unprovable from Peano axioms that appear to be more consequential for everyday mathematicians. The solution to the unprovability is to add axioms positing the existence of ""[large cardinals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_cardinal)"".

In standard set theory, ever greater infinities are constructed by taking the power set (set of all subsets) of infinite sets of lesser cardinality. So-called large cardinals are postulated infinities whose size is beyond what can be constructed by this power set chain of infinities. 

The consequences for physicists, mathematicians and philosophers of Friedman's results? Mathematics writer Richard Elwes sums it up :

&gt; In the case of physics, probably not much. ""Friedman's work is beautiful stuff, and it is obviously an important step to find unprovable statements that refer to concrete structures rather than to logical abstractions,"" says theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, New Jersey. ""But mathematics and physics are both open systems with many uncertainties, and I do not see the uncertainties as being the same for both."" The clocks won't stop or apples cease to fall just because there are questions we cannot answer about numbers.

&gt; The most severe implications are philosophical. The result means that the rules we use to manipulate numbers cannot be assumed to represent the pure and perfect truth. Rather, they are something more akin to a scientific theory such as the ""standard model"" that particle physicists use to predict the workings of particles and forces: our best approximation to reality, well supported by experimental data, but at the same time manifestly incomplete and subject to continuous and possibly radical reappraisal as fresh information comes in. The rules we use to manipulate numbers might not be universal truths, but just our best approximation of reality.

Who is she? An author or something. Upon reading it, I knew I had to write up a good 'fisk' of the criticism, seeing as it provides a good opportunity to clear up some misconceptions.

**I. Some background**

First, I detest the word 'falsificationism': it carries too much baggage. People, even people I hold in high esteem, see the word and immediately link it to the Logical Positivist theory of meaning, verificationism. No. That simply won't do. It pigeonholes the entire enterprise from the beginning. This is why I think W.W. Bartley's work on Comprehensively Critical Rationalism is an improvement on falsificationism, in that it makes explicit the radical nature of the program: it extends Kant's own critical philosophy to epistemology. We do away with support entirely.

The criterion of falsifiability, then, can be taken two ways (1) as a *criticism* of theories that claim to give empirical predictions, and yet are compatible with any state of affairs, or (2) as a *criticism* of actions taken to surreptitiously *protect* theories from testing through increasingly *ad hoc* adjustments.

With that out of the way, let's continue to Goldstein's paper.

**II. Where I get increasingly angry**

&gt;But then I started to read Popper’s work carefully, to teach him in my philosophy of science classes, and to look to scientific practice to see whether his theory survives the test of falsifiability (at least as a description of how successful science gets done).

When I see this type of language, I grit my teeth and pray that I won't have an aneurysm. Then I breathe deeply and begin typing. First of all, the criterion of falsifiability is not itself falsifiable. That's one of the oldest (and most unfair) readings. I remember when I first read Popper that I immediately thought of this same pseudo-objection: if the Logical Positivists' criterion of meaning was itself meaningless by its own lights, then perhaps Popper's criterion of science is not scientific! 

... yes. That is true. It's *not* scientific. No one claims that the criterion of falsifiability is scientific, for *it makes no empirical predictions*. Yet, even though the criterion is not a scientific statement, it's a *meaningful* statement, which sets it apart from the Logical Positivists: it's a criticism of theories that claim to make predictions while in fact they make nothing of the sort. But if we want to talk about 'successful science', I don't know about you, but I immediately think of what inspired Popper in the first place: Einstein's revolutionary theories and their highly conjectural (and highly testable) nature. Are his theories not 'successful science'?

&gt;For one thing, Popper’s characterization of how science is practiced—as a cycle of conjecture and refutation—bears little relation to what goes on in the labs and journals.

In that case, either scientists are entrenched in 'normal science', or ... scientists are entrenched in 'normal science'. If Goldstein is correct, then I weep for the future: something has been lost along the way, something important, involving the constant criticism of competing hypotheses. Of course, I don't believe that for a minute. Criticism is rampant in science. Or, at least I *hope* it is.

**III. Here's a break for you to rest your eyes**

&gt;He describes science as if it was skeet-shooting, as if the only goal of science is to prove that one theory after another is false.

What? I fear that Goldstein has not ""read Popper's work carefully"", seeing as this is a mystifying understanding of Critical Rationalism: the goals in science may be innumerable. For some scientists, they may seek fame and fortune; others may just want tenure. As for science with a capital 'S', one goal might be to eliminate error, and the only way I know to eliminate error is to work as hard as we can to show ourselves wrong: you've got to be very critical of your ideas if you want to get them published. If you aren't critical, there's a scientist more than willing to criticize their failings for you and make you look like an ass. Another goal in science might be to approximate interesting truths. Again, I know of no other way of getting closer to the truth than looking for our mistakes. Or perhaps other goals may be to problem-solve, or to *learn* from our mistakes, or to see where exactly nature limits our imagination!

&gt;Scientists rarely write the way that Popper says they should, and a good Popperian should recognize that the Master may have over-simplified the logic of theory testing.

Long ago, Popper wrote a short article about journal reform, and how journal articles should be restructured so as to explain briefly the problem situation the scientists were in, provide details on their theory on how to solve the problem situation and how this theory could be tested, and the results of their experiments, *positive or negative*. 

If scientists have not adopted these reforms, which, I should note, came from other people within the philosophy of science for some time, then I see only a problem for scientists. 

And no, I don't remember where the paper was published. I'm getting crotchety reading Goldstein, and don't have the patience to wade through books right now.

**IV. Here's another break**

&gt;Also, scientists don’t, and shouldn’t, jettison a theory as soon as a disconfirming datum comes in.

Ok. Now we get to the point where I usually start tugging at my hair. Breathe, drunkentune, breathe. 

If a theory (T) *appears* to contradict an experiment (~E), what can we know? Well, if you've passed intro to logic, you'd know that either (1) T is false, (2) ~E is false, or (3) T and ~E are false. It's really, really, really, really basic. Really.

So? This means that when we encounter ~E, there is no *conclusive* refutation of T, but it indicates that something's rotten in the state of Denmark. Something could have gone wrong in the setup of the instruments, an auxiliary hypothesis could reconcile their differences, etc. This means that falsifications are *never conclusive*. Let me say that again: *never conclusive*. 

What stands out in the entire Critical Rationalist literature is that they stress this point repeatedly: all observation is theory-laden! In fact, they've been using this fact to undermine any sort of inductive inferences since the 40's. Goldstein's misreading smacks of having read only Lakatos' article on Popper as a naive falsificationist, and little more. Or, perhaps it comes from the term 'falsification' and all the misconceptions that stem from it. I'll leave it up to you to decide.

&gt;Another problem with the falsifiability criterion is that I have seen it  become a blunt instrument, unthinkingly applied.

Then bring it up with the idiots that think the criterion is supposed to end debate, rather than provide a helping hand to scientists.

**V. What?**

&gt;Popper tried to use it to discredit not only Marxism and Freudianism as scientific theories but also Darwin’s theory of natural selection—a position that only a creationist could hold today.

[Oh come on!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP_9zH9Q44o) This is just ... just ... flagrantly dishonest. Popper never attempted to 'discredit' evolution. He said it was one of the most valuable theory designed in the natural sciences: he thought at the time, and especially in the way it was formulated in some circles, that it provided *a useful* metaphysical research program on par with the early Greek atomism or Newton's determinism, but *it was not directly testable*. Popper wrote extensively on the importance of metaphysical research programs in science. Why does Goldstein say something so pigheaded? I'll put money on the term 'falsification'. 

Oh, and here's the lying by omission: years later he learned that the theory of evolution was in principle testable, and publicly said that he was *wrong*, saying ""I have in the past described the theory as 'almost tautological', and I have tried to explain how the theory of natural selection could be untestable ... and yet of great scientific interest. ... Nevertheless, I have changed my mind about the testability and the logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad to have an opportunity to make a recantation"".

&gt;I have seen scientists claim that major theories in contemporary cosmology and physics are not “science” because they can’t think of a simple test that would falsify them.

Bring it up with the scientists, Goldstein.

&gt;But such is the godlike authority of Popper that his is the one theory that can never be falsified!

What? She can't really? Huh?

&gt;Finally, I’ve come to think that identifying scientificality with falsifiability lets certain non-scientific theories off the hook, by saying that we should try to find good reasons to believe whether a theory is true or false only when that theory is called “science.”

OK. I'm done. I can't keep this up. Is she serious?

&gt;It allows believers to protect their pet theories by saying that they can’t be, and shouldn’t be, subject to falsification, just because they’re clearly not scientific theories. Take the theory that there’s an omnipotent, omniscient, beneficent God. It may not be a scientific hypothesis, but it seems to me to be eminently falsifiable; in fact, it seems to have been amply falsified.

[Lee Smolin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Smolin) wrote a book in 2006, [The Trouble with Physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Physics) which [upset](http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/all-strung-out) a lot of his physicist contemporaries at the time. The book lamented that the dominant theoretical model for the unification of gravity and quantum mechanics, [string theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) was unfalsifiable. What started off as an elegant idea devolved into a mathematical game where extra dimensions were introduced in the model to account for all anomalies, but at the same time, rendered it beyond experimental falsification. In Smolin's opinion, this can hardly be called science. (Some related falsifiability drama can be found [here](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=468)).

**I highly recommend listening to [this podcast](http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/thinkaboutscience_20080612_6202.mp3) of an interview with Smolin in Canada CBC's ""How to Think about Science"" series.** In addition, here is a [shorter video where he discusses](http://www.closertotruth.com/video-profile/What-is-a-Theory-of-Everything-Lee-Smolin-/1272) the status of the unification efforts.

Smolin himself is no mere academic philosopher. He is working on his own alternative to string theory called [loop quantum gravity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity) which posits that the space-time itself is divided into elemental quanta of volume. A big fan of Einstein, he believes this quantisation of space, free from the Newtonian background assumptions of string theory was Einstein's own view of space-time. From what I have read of his various different ideas, he is a hardcore Leibnizian denying the fundamentalism of symmetry in physics and advocating [the principle of sufficient reason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_sufficient_reason).

His book traces physics as an institution from the philosophical tradition of Einstein, Bohr, Schroedinger etc to the pragmatist professional problem-solver that he believes characterises the modern physicist. The way funding has been allocated since the 1970s discourages independent creative thinking and professionalises the role of the physicist in his view. He attributes the rise and continuing support of string theory to this background as well as the lack of any significant experiment-backed advancement in the area for three decades.

I have heard from enough modern physicists now (in the offline world) whose mathematical craftsmanship would easily put my rusty skills to shame, but who appear to have little knowledge of or interest in the history of their disciplines, do not understand why it is relevant, and do not question the theories which pay their salaries beyond to what extent they agree with experimental evidence.  Occasionally the theory bandwagon they are riding, combined with their individual problem solving genius bring them significant honours, but often owing in my opinion, to a massive dose of luck.  I know Smolin is bound to be controversial on here, but personally I am just thankful thinkers like him still dare to prod the assumptions behind the conventional wisdom and put the current foundations of physics in context for the rest of us.",,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,,True,t3_cgp7i,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/cgp7i/theoretical_physicist_lee_smolin_believes_physics/,

Scientifically examining the brain seems to make conceiving of free will difficult. All human behaviour is apparently reducible to more or less conscious brain processes.

My question, as a non specialist and believer in (a limited, but somewhat) free will, is this: What would a free willed brain look like? Which, I guess, is another way of asking: If human beings did have free will, would science be able to detect it? Because it seems to me - and this may reflect a not particularly sophisticated philosophy of science on my part - that science in principle can only detect objective, repeatable, law-like phenomena. If free will _does_ exist in some capacity, it seems reasonable to assume that it would to an significant degree be subjective, unique and non-repeatable in its manifestation. And therefore it would lie outside the reach of scientific investigation. Obviously, the execution of free will would require employing the mechanisms of the body, including the brain. But free will would be something more than and behind that.

Does this make any sense? I ask because there are people here much smarter than I and I'd like to learn more. 

So, if we had two brains on the lab table, one of which had belonged to a being with free will and one belonging to a being without it - what would be the anatomical difference?

(I know one of the problems of this whole discussion is that no one quite knows what ""free will"" is supposed to mean. I find the ""free"" part especially problematic, because it is assumed, maybe especially by the critics, that free will must be completely free and unconstrained in order to be coherent. I don't think that's necessary. My personal take is quite minimal and I prefer to use something like ""subjective agency"" instead of ""free will"".

""I study the strong force (or some other long explanation)"" ""What can you do with that?"" "".......?""

What I mean to say is that for the ~~bulk of the population~~^1, science is little more than a means of building new tools. Science gives us the computer and the airplane and roombas. They just simply don't understand that a lot of scientists just honestly want to know how the world works. I think it is this mindset that sets the stage for denying scientific concepts in our world.

If science is a means to a new tool, than every scientific discovery is immediately followed by the question of what new tool it is introducing and what it's replacing. When scientists find evidence of climate change and evidence that it's linked to human activities, people don't see it as some quest for truth, they see the scientists as trying to overthrow the old fossil fuel industry and replace it with industry of their own. When scientists find evidence of evolution, people don't think scientists just really want to know the history of life, people think scientists are out to overthrow the religions and sell humanism instead. 

This could be really easily tested, and I would love to see it done. See if there is a strong correlation between ""science is a quest for truth or a quest for tools"" and AGW and evolution denialism.

One of the central issues of the study of the philosophy of science concerns the problem of induction. Here are some useful introductions to what inductive reasoning is all about -

* The posts of our moderator, drunkentune ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/ajr4x/an_introduction_to_the_problem_of_induction/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/aw5b5/an_introduction_to_the_problem_of_induction/)) introducing the [problem of induction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning).

Philosophy of science is not a science itself (at least not yet!) - you won't find universal consensus or confirmation/rejection of hypotheses by observation here. Philosophy of science is concerned with how the results of science should shape our beliefs about the Universe. In fact, the philosophy of science is characterised by many schools of thoughts which in some sense compete for your subjective allegiance. Here are some of the key schools of thoughts and ways of thinking about different aspects of science.

* [Confirmation holism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_holism), [naturalism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-naturalized/) and [evolutionary epistemology](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-evolutionary/).

Finally the study of the history of science is closely related to the study of the philosophy of science. This acceptance of historical development as informing philosophy of science became widespread amongst philosophers after the shortcomings of the logical positivism movement in the first half of the 20th century to completely objectivify science, and following the work of Thomas Kuhn. The degree to which scientific pursuit reveals objective truth has been hotly debated ever since.

2373 readers of this subreddit now. Phew. Seemed just like yesterday when we were [thanking everyone and congratulating ourselves](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/related/am2cz/philosophyofscience_subreddit_reaches_1000_users/) on reaching 1000 subscribers. Thanks to everyone for your readership and continued support. Your readership and participation is what makes this subreddit work.

But with increased readership comes diversity and we thought it was about time we arranged the subreddit a little better for all readers. As you can see, we have rebuilt the subreddit description (on the right) to help people create ideas for posts on this subreddit. Please do consider posting. It's clear from your comments that many of you have very interesting ideas that other readers would really appreciate discussing. The worst that can happen is your post gets downvoted to oblivion. All of us who have experienced such unthinkable brutality can report we still have full use of our vital functions, [Mrs Brown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buqtdpuZxvk).

We have also discussed creating an introduction post for those readers who have never had any exposure to the study of the philosophy of science before and are wondering what it is all about.  We will then link to this post from the main subreddit description. The text of this post will (eventually) be that introduction post.

What other links and information did you find useful when you began to learn about what the philosophy of science is all about? Perhaps you still aren't really sure? What would you *like* to see in this case? Bear in mind our readers come from many educational and science backgrounds - many from mathematics, philosophy, the physical sciences and the social sciences.

All suggestions welcome. I will edit this text at the end of this discussion to reflect our collective thoughts and then link to it from the subreddit description. Please upvote this post if you think it's a good idea so we can keep it visible to others to share their thoughts.

Rutherford was questioned : 
&gt; I do not see why Einstein is accorded a greater public
acclaim than you. After all, you invented the nuclear model of the atom; and that model provides the basis for all of physical science today and it is even more universal in its applications than Newton's laws of gravitation.

Rutherford, in response, turned to Eddington and said, 'You are responsible for Einstein's fame'. And more seriously, he continued:
&gt; The war had just ended: and the complacency of the Victorian and the Edwardian times had been shattered. The people felt that all their values and all their ideals had lost their bearings. Now, suddenly they learnt that an astronomical prediction by a German scientist had been confirmed by expeditions to Brazil and West Africa and, indeed, prepared for already during the war, by British astronomers. Astronomy had always appealed to public imagination; and an astronomical discovery transcending worldly strife, struck a responsive chord. The meeting of the Royal Society, at which the results of the British expeditions were reported, was headlined in all the
British papers; and the typhoon of publicity crossed the Atlantic. From that point on, the American press played Einstein to the maximum.

Chandrasekhar goes on to illustrate how precarious Einstein's fame had been :

&gt; Suppose the war had not come and [Finlay-Freundlich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Finlay-Freundlich) had been able to observe the 1914 eclipse and had found a deflection of 1.7 seconds of arc at a time when Einstein was predicting a deflection of only 0.83 seconds of arc. Imagine how tame Einstein's 1915 calculation of 1.7 seconds of arc would have seemed.... He would have been belatedly changing the value after the event, having first been shown to have been wrong... and the deflection of light would have lost the tremendous impact that it had as a prediction.

The expedition of Finlay-Freundlich, who was a research associate of Einstein was confounded by the start of World War 1.

A comparison of belief.,77,8,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/aden3/philosophers_of_science_v_philosophers_of/,"*Originally posted in [/r/PhilosophyofScience](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience).*

On the Philosophy sub-reddit a few days ago, [a link to a survey](http://philpapers.org/surveys/) of 3226 philosophers inquiring of their philosophical beliefs was [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ach19/the_results_of_david_chalmers_survey_into/). 56% of the respondents were faculty members and 26% were graduate students. I thought it would be interesting to compare how the philosophical beliefs of Philosophers of Science (PoSs) compared with those of Philosophers of Mathematics (PoMs) and Philosophers of Biology and general philosophers (PGs) [EDIT: Note that by general philosophers, I mean ALL philosophers here]. I have to admit I wasn't familiar with all of the terms used in the survey but have provided links to relevant information. If anyone wants to provide one or two sentence descriptions of any of them, I would be happy to put them up in the results. Below I have highlighted only the results where there is a significant difference in response between the three groups.

1. [A priori knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori). PoSs (55%) believe in a priori knowledge significantly less than PoMs (69%) and PGs (71%) do. EDIT: Philosophers of Biology : 45%.

2. Abstract objects : [nominalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalism) v [platonism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism). PoSs (26%) were considerably less likely than PGs (39%) to be platonists and far less likely than PoMs (60%). EDIT: Only 13% of Philosophers of Biology are platonists. So this Philosopher of Mathematics and this Philosopher of Biology walk into a bar ....

3. [Aesthetic value: objective or subjective?](http://www.csulb.edu/~jvancamp/freedom4.html). Both PGs (41%) and PoMs (46%) favoured aesthetic value as being objective while only (34%) of PoSs did so.

4. [Epistemic justification: internalism or externalism?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalism#Justification). Increasingly favoured externalism from PGs (43%) -&gt; PoSs (49%) -&gt; PoMs (54%).

5. [Free will: compatibilism, libertarianism, or no free will?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will#In_Western_philosophy). No big differences. Compatibilism was dominant (~60%).

5. God: theism or atheism? All predominantly atheist (~74%) but the PoSs had far fewer theists (3%) than the other two groups. PoMs had 20% theists. EDIT: 89% of Philosophers of Biology are atheists. 

6. Knowledge: [empiricism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism) or [rationalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism)? Striking difference between PoMs who marginally favoured rationalism (37%) and PoSs who strongly favoured empiricism (56%). EDIT: Philosophers of Biology strongly favoured empiricism (79%). Those guys are seriously earthy.

7. [Laws of nature: Humean or non-Humean?](http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/l/lawofnat.htm#H2) Both PoSs and PoMs (40%) were substantially more Humean than PGs (25%). Edit : Philosophers of Biology (53%)

8. Meta-ethics: [moral realism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_realism) or [moral anti-realism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/)? Biggest difference here was between the PoSs who were predominantly moral anti-realists (47%) while only 28% PGs were.

9. EDIT: [Mind: physicalism or non-physicalism?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism) Pro physicalism: PoSs (74%), PoMs (43%) and PGs (56%). Philosophers of Biology : 87%. Serious business.

10. [Newcomb's problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_problem). PoMs (43%) favour two boxes more than the PGs (31%) do.

11. [Personal identity: biological view, psychological view, or further-fact view?](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-ethics/#ConAcc). Most striking difference was the favouring of the biological view by PoSs (27%) against the PoMs (9%).

12. Politics: communitarianism, egalitarianism, or libertarianism? Most notable result was that the PoMs were far less willing to offer any opinion on the whole topic than either PGs or PoS. 

13. Science: [scientific realism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/) or [scientific anti-realism?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-realism#Anti-realism_in_Science) The main result here is that PoSs were considerably more willing to accept an alternative to scientific realism (alternatives = 40%) than the other two groups (~25%) EDIT: Interestingly, the epistemologists were seriously realist (84%).

14. EDIT: [Teletransporter (new matter): survival or death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdxucpPq6Lc)? Huge differences here with the PoMs who overwhelmingly were either of no opinion or believed there were was no fact of the matter (43%) while PGs and PoSs who felt the same only constituted 17%. (Thanks to nebiz and drunkentune for explanations)

15. [Time: A-theory or B-theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-series_and_B-series)? The dominant answer for all groups was ""other"" but the POMs accepted B-theory (40%) significantly more than the PGs (26%).

16. [Zombies](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/): inconceivable, conceivable but not metaphysically possible, or metaphysically possible? PoMs want to believe in their metaphysical possibility (29%) somewhat more than PoSs (17%) do.

Humorous side-note : the percentage of Social and Political Philosophers who answered the Logic question as ""insufficiently familiar with the issue"" (31%) was more than 2.5 times the average.

Anyone who has studied any physics knows how important [conservation laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law) are. They seem to magically pop out of physicists minds to explain some process of physics. Consider [conservation of linear momentum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum#Conservation_of_linear_momentum), [conservation of energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy), [conservation of electric charge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_conservation), [conservation of quantum probability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_equation#Quantum_mechanics) for example. These conservation laws often go well beyond the experimental data when they are first conceived and seem to reflect some fundamental [symmetry of physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_physics).

Then in 1915, along comes this 33 year old German mathematician, [Emmy Noether](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether) who proves this *mathematical* theorem about theoretical physics which roughly states that certain mathematically well-behaved actions of physical systems which exhibit a kind of symmetry or invariance under some transformation, always have a corresponding conservation law. This is known is **[Noether's theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether's_theorem)**. All these terms are defined precisely in the theorem (which is kind of amazing in itself).

Here is what [Einstein had to say](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Obits2/Noether_Emmy_Einstein.html) about Emmy Noether. How many of us have even heard of her? I and some of my physics-educated friends hadn't. 

I still haven't fully gotten my head around the theorem or its epistemological consequences. The whole concept of conservation laws seem amazing to me. It's like very best physicists can somehow call on these mathematical structures that keep turning up over and over again in varied physical systems to explain and unify observation past and future. (Like where did Einstein pull the ""laws of physics must be invariant in all inertial reference frames"" hypothesis from? Seemed like a major epistemological leap beyond the data to me - no denying it has worked well though).

Check out [some of the applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether's_theorem#Applications) of the theorem -

* the invariance of physical systems with respect to spatial translation (in other words, that the laws of physics do not vary with locations in space) gives the law of conservation of linear momentum;
* invariance with respect to rotation gives the law of conservation of angular momentum;
* invariance with respect to time translation gives the well-known law of conservation of energy
* In quantum field theory, the analog to Noether's theorem, the Ward-Takahashi identities, yields further conservation laws, such as the conservation of electric charge from the invariance with respect to a change in the phase factor of the complex field of the charged particle and the associated gauge of the electric potential and vector potential.

Any current practising physicists or those with extensive related reading care to explain more about the theorem and how much practical use it has been in constructing new theories of physics? What does this suggest about the nature of science? It seems to re-open my own mind (at least somewhat) towards what I thought was a fairly wacky epistemology, [the Mathematical Universe hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis) of [Max Tegmark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Tegmark).

Is our experience of time as lapsing just an illusion?",78,11,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/c2lke/kurt_goedels_mathematically_plausible_time_travel/,"*Originally posted in [/r/PhilosophyofScience](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience).*

PREFACE : The idea for this post came from the book [Goedel: A Life of Logic](http://www.amazon.com/Gödel-Logic-John-L-Casti/dp/0738205184) which I can't recommend highly enough. I met one of the authors, Werner DePauli, while in Vienna. Werner (affectionately known to friends as Jimmy) is a former Professor of Mathematics at the University of Vienna who was incredibly generous to me despite just simply being a moderator of this humble subReddit. Jimmy is in a wheelchair living out his retirement with the help of a nurse. He is largely responsible for putting Goedel on the map in Austria. He is also very impressed by the interest in Goedel on Reddit.

[Kurt Goedel](http://kgs.logic.at/index.php?id=23) and Albert Einstein [frequently hooked up while at Princeton](http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;source=imghp&amp;q=godel+einstein). At one point, Goedel got interested in relativity theory and mathematically derived a solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity which demonstrated that time travel into the past was plausible in some physical configuration of the universe. Goedel subsequently reasoned that there could be no objective ""lapsing"" of time - time is an illusion derived from our special mode of perception. The solution is known as the [Goedel metric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel_metric). A copy of the original paper can [be found here](http://rmp.aps.org/abstract/RMP/v21/i3/p447_1).

Essentially, the solution requires the entire universe to be rotating. In this configuration each observer sees the entire universe as rotating around him. The solution however does not permit expansion as in the Universe we observe. Goedel reasons nevertheless that the mathematical possibility of a universe where travel back in time is plausible suggests that the absoluteness of time in our own universe must be an illusion.  He writes : 

&gt; The mere compatibility with the laws of nature of worlds in which there is no distinguished absolute time and in which, therefore, no objective lapse of time can exist, throws some light on the meaning of time also in those worlds in which an absolute can be defined. For, if someone asserts that this absolute time is lapsing, he accepts as a consequence that whether or not an objective lapse of time exists (i.e., whether or not a time in the ordinary sense of the word exists) depends on the particular way in which matter and its motion are arranged in the world. This is not a straightforward contradiction; nevertheless, a philosophical view leading to such consequences can hardly be considered as satisfactory. 

Time travel into the past raises obvious difficulties about causality - going back in time to kill your infant self for example. Goedel seemed to believe such absurdities would be overcome by principled impossibilities. He offers an analogy by way of the [uncertainty principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle) :

&gt; But the practical difficulties [in travelling into the past] would hardly seem to be trifling. Moreover, the boundary between difficulties in practice and difficulties in principle is not at all fixed. What was earlier a practical difficulty in atomic physics has today become an impossibility in principle, in consequence of the uncertainty principle: and the same could one day happen also for those difficulties that reside not in the domain of the “too small” but of the “too large.” 

Einstein considered the work an ""important contribution to the general theory of relativity..."" and was apparently very confused by the results but dismissed them as not plausible in our own universe. This is not the end of the story however. Time travel has apparently been shown to be compatible with David Deutsch's [""many worlds"" interpretation of quantum mechanics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabric_of_Reality#Time_travel). Goedel's solution probably poses more questions than it answers for the philosopher.

**[This Discover magazine article](http://discovermagazine.com/2002/mar/featgodel)** is a must-read for readable discussion about the Einstein-Goedel relationship and Goedel's time travel work. Another good article [here](http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/Time.pdf).

---

Incidentally, Jimmy produced a documentary of Goedel's life (more information to come in a later post) which notes Goedel started to develop a wacky interest in ghosts shortly after his work on the time travel solution (seriously). He raises the question of whether ghosts were Goedel's psychological explanation for time-travellers (trust me - from all reports - Goedel became increasingly unhinged).

What is clear is that a wide scientific consensus is forming that the big bang was *not* how the Universe began.

The program is particularly notable from a PoS standpoint for the niggling debate-between-the-lines between [Andrei Linde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Linde), the creator of the eternal chaotic inflation theory and [Neil Turok](http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/index.php?id=30&amp;task=view&amp;Itemid=72&amp;pi=3302&amp;option=com_content), the Director of the Perimeter Institute. As I understand it, Linde's theory appears to be the more robust but Turok believes its broad design gives it too many degrees of freedom to explain phenomenon. Linde claims Turok's theories are unstable and are ad-hoc responses to data.

Freakonomics versus the Tipping Point.,72,11,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/d5nni/why_did_crime_rates_plummet_in_new_york_city_in/,"Walking around a well-managed big city might leave you with the impression that humans are fundamentally well-behaved and self-organising. Past experience tells us otherwise. Crime waves, disease outbreaks, traffic congestion, electricity blackouts, water contamination. riots are constant threats to city order.

One such example of a city under threat of losing control to crime was New York City in the 1980s. The city had a worldwide reputation as a dangerous place to be. One of my earliest memories was watching a TV report about [this incident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_blackout_of_1977#Effects). (Check [this doco](http://vodpod.com/watch/2267789-streets-of-new-york-rise-fall-of-crime-in-new-york-since-1970s-76-min-documentary) out too). Yet in the 1990s, something abruptly changed and all categories of crime abruptly plummeted as [**seen here**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NYC_murders.PNG). Many ""on the ground"" attribute the reduction to the crime mapping system used in [Compstat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompStat) during Rudolph Giuliani's administration.

---

I recently read both Steven Levitt's [Freakonomics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freakonomics) and Malcolm Gladwell's [Tipping Point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point) which both provide explanations for the stunning crime decrease. They are presented in such simple and compelling ways - it's easy to be persuaded by both. Problem is - they pretty much have nothing in common as explanations.

Gladwell claims [**broken windows theory**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows) is responsible. Essentially, the perception that the authorities have lost control of the city by allowing widespread fare evasion, neighborhoods to look uncared for and other misdemeanours creates an atmosphere conducive to harder crimes. So, the theory goes, prosecuting more misdemeanours will stem the flow of harder crime. [**This graph**](http://imgur.com/rD0wo.jpg) is used to illustrate the connection. 

Levitt takes an entirely different approach. He claims the reduction of crime was due to the [**flow-through effects of legalised abortion**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impact_of_Legalized_Abortion_on_Crime) which took unwanted young adults off the streets. (Anyone remember the [Elvis lyrics ""he'll grow to be an angry young man some day""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n3ebuL1cPA)?). Here is a [**compelling table of data**](http://i.imgur.com/FRyDa.jpg) used to demonstrate the connection.

The two competing views were first elaborated in two papers in 2001, Levitt's [The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=174508) and Kelling and Sousa's [Do Police Matter: An Analysis of the Impact of New York City's Police Reforms (PDF)](http://www.manhattan-institute.org/pdf/cr_22.pdf). Levitt went on to publish [another paper in 2004](https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B9y5Ze4Mo8qlZjBjYWE3NTEtMTMyNS00MmMzLTlhZTctZGVkMTEwNzZlMDE0&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=COHPxNQF) which among other things, trashed broken windows theory. Shortly after, two government economists went on to [trash Levitt's theory](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113314261192407815-HLjarwtM95Erz45QPP0pDWul8rc_20061127.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top).

Most likely ""causes"" in my view based on my reading? Receding crack epidemic, increased police presence and broken windows theory. Abortion? Well maybe via one of these other avenues. Causality is a murky business.

Yet somehow, amidst all this academic posturing, statistical ambiguity and theory divergence, cities do stay clean, safe, uncongested and healthy. While the complexities and non-linearities will render the academic study of city management pseudo-scientific by any usual measure, a dynamic scientific outlook makes a measurable difference to the quality of our lives. It's too easy to measure all of science by the predictability of the physical sciences. Most of our daily lives are far more subject to highly complex, non-linear processes that by their inherent mathematical natures, will *never* yield to a robust predictability.",,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,,True,t3_d5nni,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/d5nni/why_did_crime_rates_plummet_in_new_york_city_in/,

I think I may be having something of a crisis of ""faith"" in the purpose of some science.  I love science.  I realize that I only get one shot at life, one shot to understand the world around me, and so by being a scientist, I can actively do my part to increase my own understanding and the overall sum of human understanding as to why our world works as it does.  But sometimes I wonder why that's important outside of the scientific community.
      Recently I was reading some papers on the origin of a type of rock called anorthosite.  Anorthosite is an igneous rock made of essentially only one mineral (plagioclase feldspar) and frequently occurs as a part of gigantic igneous bodies called layered intrusive complexes.  It can also occur as very large bodies (we're talking hundreds to thousands of cubic kilometers) outside of these complexes.  For example, the High Peaks in the Adirondack mountains are all made of a beautiful blue anorthosite.  The more papers I read, the more I realized that essentially *we have no freaking idea why anorthosites can even exist in the first place.*  This is something geologists have been trying to figure out since the early 1900's, maybe earlier, and we *still don't know.*  When that really sank in, I had to stop reading and sit for a moment.  There is some cryptic process that the earth performed for hundreds of millions of years (the earth can't seem to make anorthosites anymore) that resulted in these unfathomable masses of gorgeous rock that make up mountains.  That, to me, is beautiful.  That is why I'm a scientist.  Without even getting off this planet, without even tackling the startling complexity of life, we can find things, literally larger than mountains, that we just don't know.  And that's the sort of thing that drives me to learn more, to try to discover, to try and find out if we're even asking the right *kinds* of questions to go about solving problems like this.  But then I started thinking about what it looks like from an outsider perspective.  Here are these weird people who go outside banging on rocks with hammers, carrying rocks miles through the woods, filling their offices/labs/cars/homes with rocks...  Why?  Why should the National Science Foundation give grants, sometimes in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, to some weirdo with a beard who has a thing for rocks, just because he wants to know why the Adirondacks are made of a blue rock and not a gray rock.  Why does it matter?  Why don't they use that money to build a homeless shelter or something?
    Maybe anorthosites aren't the best example for this.  They occur in the layered intrusive complexes that are the worlds primary sources of metals such as platinum and palladium, so understanding part of that system may be economically beneficial.  But what about the other questions?  The ones that don't result in a dollar sign at the end of the road?  Because there are plenty of those that receive very large amounts of funding.  Why should it matter, for example, if we know the chemical composition of a magma that formed an igneous body that has no connection to natural resources? That information won't get us to Mars.  It won't make anyone's life better.  It won't change our understanding of how the universe works.  
      Finding the answers to these sorts of scientific questions fascinates me.  I love the science and the process; I love not understanding something and realizing that I can go ahead and try and do something about that.  But sometimes I also wonder if I should.  Why should I take these financial resources that could go to feeding a family and instead use the money to answer a question that no one will care about except some weirdos who like rocks a little too much?
    Maybe the question doesn't apply directly to me, since I'm an economic geologist (I figure out where and why we find things such as mineable gold deposits).  But at heart, I'm an academic who loves and sometimes studies the ""useless"" questions.  What do you folks think?

TL;DR Why should we spend money on science that will probably not be of any help or interest to anyone outside of science?

Gödel's results require that the axiomatic system in question is sufficiently powerful to allow counting to infinity (i.e. the natural numbers). It is difficult to even come up with a scientific theory that requires the existence of the natural numbers to generate meaningful hypotheses (maybe some aspects of applied chaos theory?). I have compiled a small collection of links to sources that debunk some of the common misconceptions about the implications of Gödel's theorems. I will add to this as I find more.

Guess where everything our world is based upon comes from? Planes,cars,radio,tv's,electricity. Nothing of it would be without those great people that made discoveries and pushed the boundaries of knowledge one day.


For what I've seen, keeping the above in mind, science isn't appreciated at all in our society and culture. People that have great minds are called geeks, with a negative image pasted on them. It almost seems like being ignorant is being promoted. Not everyone should admire it like I do for example, every person has his own views on life, but minds that are capable of attributing to the progress of mankind, being bullied/talked out of it because of our culture of ignorance is a step too far.


That's only the cultural aspect. I think the economic aspect is even worse. Barbie girls, shaking their asses in videoclips on tv, earn at least 10 times more than doctors saving lifes, and *really* contribute to what's important. In our society, carreers that matter less on the long run, are being rewarded better economically than carreers that do, or at least I think so.

Fundamental to the idea of the Singularity is the concept of 'Seed AI' or 'recursively self-improved AI'.

&gt;Seed AI is a hypothesized type of strong artificial intelligence capable of recursive self-improvement. If the AI was about as good at programming as the people that created it, it should be able to reprogram itself to be even more intelligent. Having improved itself it would then become better at improving itself, potentially leading to an exponential increase in intelligence.

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_AI

Computers are already better than human intelligence in many ways. Your calculators can calculate quicker than you do, Wikipedia stores more information than your brain, computers can beat the best humans at chess, etcetera. 

Humans still beat AI at things like pattern recognition and language. This isn't strange: the computational power of the human brain is only rivaled by the biggest and most expensive supercomputers. But if the exponential progress of computing power progresses like it has done for roughly the last century, affordable PCs will have the same power as the brain [before 2030](http://images.bit-tech.net/content_images/2009/04/the-future-of-artificial-intelligence/graph2.jpg).

It seems likely that we'll figure out how the brain works (and use this to construct human-like AI) roughly around that year. [Vernor Vinge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge) expects the Singularity to happen before 2030, [Kurzweil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil) suggests 2045. 

Human-like AI means that we can combine the best characteristics of human thinking and computers. You know in which ways you are 'superior' to computers, but there are many ways in which computers can improve upon human thinking...

&gt;**Speed.** Our axons carry signals at 75 meters per second or slower. A machine can pass signals along about **4 million times** more quickly.

&gt;**Computational resources.** The brain’s size and neuron count is restrained by skull size, metabolism, and other factors. AIs could be built **on the scale of buildings or cities** or larger. When we can make circuits no smaller, we can just add more of them.

&gt;**Rationality.** As we explored earlier, human brains do nothing like optimal belief formation or goal achievement. Machines can be built from the ground up using (computable approximations of) optimal Bayesian decision networks, and indeed this is already a leading paradigm in artificial agent design.

&gt;**Introspective access / editability.** We humans have almost no introspective access to our cognitive algorithms, and cannot easily edit and improve them. Machines can already do this (see Eurisko and metaheuristics). A limited hack like the method of loci greatly improves human memory; machines can do this kind of thing in spades.

&gt;There is no reason in principle why machines could not surpass our abilities at technology design or general reasoning by a similar margin. **The human level is a minor pit-stop on the way to the highest level of intelligence allowed by physics, and there is plenty of room above us.**

&gt;http://facingthesingularity.com/2011/plenty-of-room-above-us/

[""Facing the Singularity""](http://facingthesingularity.com/) explains the Singularity in an excellent way. There is also a subreddit dedicated to it: /r/singularity.

Bill Gates is a ['believer'](http://www.cryonet.org/cgi-bin/dsp.cgi?msg=27305). Google just [recruited Ray Kurzweil](http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/06/googles-director-of-engineering-ray-kurzweil-is-building-your-cybernetic-friend/). Google, Cisco and Nokia are [founders of Singularity University](http://singularityu.org/community/founders/).

Now if you are pretty strong mathematically, go [straight to the Wiki description](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_paradox#The_paradox) of the paradox. Otherwise see my own proof cartoon (so called, because it depicts even less reality than a proof sketch ... but it might help some people) of the apparent paradox at the end of this post.

So how do we get from paradoxes about English statements to Goedelian incompleteness? Here is a [very rough sketch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_paradox#Formal_analogues) on how the paradox is adapted to prove Goedel's key incompleteness theorem. 

But the ""proof"" I like most is by [Greg Chaitlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Chaitin), and if you are any sort of computer scientist, you might be able to follow along with some kind of justified confidence. [Here is his quite readable paper](http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/unm2.html) on the subject (his proof starts around half way down). Has quite an entertaining introduction describing his attempt at meeting Goedel himself in the 70s. Essentially, the proof adapts the word ""definable in X words"" in the Berry Paradox to ""cannot be specified by a computer program using Y bits"". 

Chaitlin himself like other well-known logicians is a bit errr ... ""fruity"". He has got himself into trouble before with his [over-reaching and some have said, megalomanicial  philosophical claims](http://www.ams.org/notices/200109/rev-panu.pdf) (see page 994 onwards). Here he is [discussing God](http://www.closertotruth.com/video-profile/What-Can-Science-Say-About-God-Gregory-Chaitin-/1627).

**Proof cartoon of the paradoxical nature of The Berry Paradox.**

Positive integers (numbers like 1,2,3... etc) can be feasibly expressed by a variety of English statements. Consider for example these statements. 

* The sum of the first ten primes.

* Two thousand one hundred and thirty seven.

* Ninety cubed plus forty three squared plus seventeen.

* The fifty seventh perfect number minus thirteen.

* The smallest prime larger than five trillion.

These all describe a unique positive integer. Now we know there are a finite number of English words in the dictionary. So there can only be a finite number of English phrases under twelve words. But there are an infinite number of positive integers, so there must exist some set of numbers which are not definable by English phrases under twelve words (there are an infinite number of such numbers in fact, so this set is infinite).  Ok cool.

Now every non-empty set of positive integers (infinite or finite) must have a least element. Why? Well by [mathematical induction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction). Assume there is no least element.  So the number 1 cant be in the set because if it were, it must be the least element - being the smallest positive integer. If n is not in the set, then n+1 can't be in the set, or n+1 would be the least element. So by induction, no positive integers are in the set. But we know this is false, so there must be a least element.

So there *is* a positive integer X which is ""the smallest positive integer not definable in under twelve English words"". But wait, the phrase ""the smallest positive integer not definable in under twelve English words"" has only eleven words and this phrase has just defined X, so X *is* definable in under twelve English words!  *Sounds of head explosion*.",,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,,True,t3_dgbgr,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/dgbgr/the_berry_paradox_and_simpler_more_recent_proofs/,

1328746812.0,60,self.PhilosophyofScience,ph1xn,How do we continue to grow intellectually while bridging the gap between the Knows and the Know-nots?,65,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/ph1xn/how_do_we_continue_to_grow_intellectually_while/,"I think I began to lose a tangible understanding of how “things” actually work right about the time that the carburetor was replaced by the electronic fuel injector.  I can look back now and realistically grasp just about every aspect of building a car, from the hand-drawn concepts, to the mining of iron ore, to the rag that polished the bumper as it rolled off the assembly line. But now, with 40+ years of life, a graduate degree, and literally the world of knowledge at my fingertips, I am surrounded by stuff that I couldn’t possibly begin to explain.

I am fascinated by so much of what I find (here) and I actually feel as if I’m learning more and more of what I don’t know, every day.  I feel like the circumference of my knowledge is expanding ever faster and I’m just barely able to hang on and keep up. It’s a fucking thrill ride for sure.

Yet, when I stop and think about it, I find myself having difficulty remembering that so much of what I think I know isn’t actually first hand knowledge, but rather a concrete “belief” that what I know to be true, is true, because I know others have first hand knowledge.  I’m not quite sure how to explain my conundrum, but maybe an example will help.  While watching The Universe the other night, the host talked about Quasars.  He explained that the core of this was spinning at about 1,500 revolutions per minute while a beautiful graphic was on screen.  Now, I fully understood all the words used to describe this.  I fully understood that the narrator clearly understood this, and the information was presented as “absolute” fact.  There was no speculation about the workings of this quasar, per se.

What really baked my noodle, however, is when the narrator and the litany of contributing scientists explain that although the actions of this quasar are fully understood, all of the information presented isn’t really verifiable from the naked eye, but rather by the application of more science (a la http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=486), which of course is even harder to understand than the original concept.  So, my point here is that there is so much “science” involved with each and every aspect of that explanation that I couldn’t possibly begin to fully understand that.  In a conversation with Someone Who Knows, they would likely punch me in my question for incessantly asking “But what does THAT mean?”

The more I try to grasp the complexity of topics like the size of the universe or the speed of light, or whatever, the more I realize that the gap between what I actually know (first hand knowledge) and what I believe someone else knows to be first hand knowledge, is growing exponentially.  (And I don’t mean to suggest that there’s a bunch of giddy space nerds viewing my Quasar up close and for real.  I mean, those same scientific rock stars have the capacity to understand the math, physics, mechanics and whatever else that enables one to assimilate and incorporate that type of information into their lives…and then figure out a way to dumb it down enough so that someone like me can barely understand.).

We are moving towards a future where the “foundational core concepts” of any given subject are going to be so enormous that I cannot fathom how we will have the time to teach those future generations, so that they will have the time to make the next exponential leaps.  The only way I can think this to be possible, is to raise the bar of “foundational” to a level ever higher.  Which would suggest that all those future scientists will be taking all that below-the-bar foundational material for granted….and that seems impossible (figuratively).

We are almost at the day when an astro-scientist can come on TV and explain that the scientific community knows, without a shadow of a doubt, that a planet exists a kabillion light years away because the star it is orbiting wobbles slightly...and nobody in the audience says…”Well, fuck me…how in the world do you know THAT?”.  The science needed to arrive at that conclusion is mind fuzzling and yet it will soon be as matter-of-fact as the science behind the workings of my boring old solar calculator.

I think the other side of this, however, is very concerning.  It seems to me that the larger the gap between the cutting edge of science and humanities ability to understand, the more likely that the science becomes doubted or minimized or labeled as magic.  I think we may see this now with some of the creationist arguments…it is quite possible that this is the only thing that makes sense to someone that cannot grasp the science involved with evolution.

So, I guess the question is....How do we continue to grow intellectually while bridging the gap between the Knows and the Know-nots?

Seems to support Kuhn's conclusions.,68,8,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/eq5z5/who_accepted_einsteins_theories_of_relativity/,"*This information is taken from Frank Sulloway's book, [Born to Rebel: Birth Order, Family Dynamics, and Creative Lives](http://www.amazon.com/Born-Rebel-Family-Dynamics-Creative/dp/0679758763) and a related paper.*

---

There were 308 scientists in his population for the relativity revolution, 222 worked in physics, 83 in mathematics and 45 in astronomy (some contributed to more than one ﬁeld). Their positions were detailed in Glick's [The Comparative Reception of Relativity](http://www.amazon.com/Comparative-Reception-Relativity-Studies-Philosophy/dp/9027724989/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1293063572&amp;sr=1-1).

For special relativity the sample size of 135. The best predictors for support were :

* age (correlation =  -0.44)

* social attitudes (correlation =  +0.39 with being more liberal)

* birth order (correlation = +0.30 with being later-born rather than ﬁrst-born)

* being Jewish (correlation = +0.13). 

The results are similar for support of special and general relativity by the larger
group of 308 scientists (correlations  -0.47, 0.38, 0.19 and 0.22 respectively). Physicists and mathematicians were somewhat more likely than astronomers to support relativity but the differences
are not signiﬁcant. The paper notes that Max Planck, a key advocate was a younger sibling in his family.

Seems to support [Thomas Kuhn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions)'s position that outmoded paradigms in science aren't overturned by a sudden change of consensus among scientists. Rather, the scientists of the old paradigm hang on to their beliefs and the new paradigm only becomes dominant when they die out - a persuasive argument against the existence of any reliable scientific ""method"". Would love to see a similar survey done for cold fusion.

Anyway, by way of set-up, this is a sketch of naturalistic epistemology, as best I understand it (please correct me if I'm way off base):


We can't know for certain whether there's a God or ""higher power"" of any sort (and the pertinent sort of God here is the kind that intervenes in the natural world), and even if we could, we couldn't predict His actions, or perhaps not even describe them.


Therefore, anything that falls under the rubric ""science"" needs to be observable (if indirectly) and repeatable.


The naturalistic^1 worldview then essentially says, We have no evidence for ""miracles"" as such, so we ought generally to accept (and live based upon?) the conclusions of science, rather than any claims to the miraculous.

My question is this: if there were an interventionist God, or really anything supernatural - i.e., a Being or beings able to act upon the universe without being subject to the reactions of the universe - wouldn't we expect unique, non-observable, non-repeatable outcomes?

Note that I'm not (at this point) positing an argument for a particular belief system, only floating the topic for discussion.

I can't help myself with one example, though: suppose Jesus did really rise from the dead. If we claim that's impossible, haven't we presupposed the knowledge that there isn't an interventionist God, and then essentially used that presupposition to assert that, no, Jesus couldn't be risen, when in fact He is?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

^1 I realize that's an imprecise term, but I want to encompass everything from atheists to agnostics to deists.

Edit 1:  formatting.

Edit 2:  Thanks for all the insightful answers!  There's another aspect I'm curious about, while we're at it:  wouldn't we expect the ""miraculous"" event to affect the matter nearby, and via the ""butterfly effect,"" eventually, much further out matter, too?

Seven months after the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of the Species, several prominent philosophers and scientists participated in a now famous 1860 [debate about evolution at Oxford University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_Oxford_evolution_debate). In attendance were the biologist [Thomas Huxley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley), a controversial and pugnacious early advocate of evolution, and [Samuel Wilberforce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Wilberforce), the Bishop of Oxford at the time (and son of William Wilberforce who tried to abolish the slave trade). Incidentally, Huxley famously [coined the term ""agnostic""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley_and_agnosticism#Thomas_Henry_Huxley) to describe his religious views. 

**Full details about the exchange and its background are described by Oxford philosopher John Lucas in this short essay [""Wilberforce and Huxley: A Legendary Encounter""](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/legend.html)**. A classic and highly consequential clash between science and religion.

1363721503.0,53,self.PhilosophyofScience,1am19h,What is Energy really?,70,17,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/1am19h/what_is_energy_really/,"I'm hoping to garner a better understanding of this.  On this surface, it seems obvious enough, at least insofar as myself and others understand what we've been told based on the information available today.  

My interest in Energy follows.  My understanding of it on a pragmatic level is that energy is the ability to do work.  In this capacity, its been perceived by me for a long time as more of the intangible ability that other things bear in them to accomplish tasks, (not necessarily by conscious intent, i.e. - gravity may cause an apple to fall from the tree as the apple has potential energy in it which is translated to kinetic energy once detached from the tree and in the free flow of gravity until it meets a barrier to stop its progress, often of an electromagnetic variety).  

Similarly though, Einstein's Mass–energy equivalence formula (E = mc^2) indicates that matter is a combination of its mass and the square of the speed of light such that this has its direct equivalent of Energy.  In this way, the intangible aspects of Energy are directly related with the tangible aspects of matter, and while I'm open-minded enough to embrace that we may embody these more intangible properties as our senses create the illusion of a tangible reality, (e.g. - the color of a seat comes from what isn't absorbed by the atoms of the seat and what stops us falling through it is founded in the electromagnetic principles), it's still difficult to answer then what is this intangible reality we seem to be existing within.  

Further, as we examine the subatomic, suppositions have proposed that there is a quantum world of on the smallest levels comprised of tightly packed bundles of energy.  But here again...what tangibly is Energy?

Even on the Wiki page for Energy, (*not a wonderful resource, I know, but one often reviewed and updated by a wide community*), the topic of ""what is energy?"" is stated as being ""difficult to answer in a simple, intuitive way.""  It then goes further to cite others such as Richard Feynman supporting this point.  

If Energy is (*possibly just*) a resource available to cause change over time, actions and reactions, what then is Energy in the tangible world independent from its ability to produce these effects. Particle, or waves.  Universal fields or multidimensional branes.  What then is the fundamental of what Energy is?  

**TL;DR** - What is Energy tangibly? What is a quanta of energy by itself?

**Additional** - I realize there may be no readily available answer to this question, though this attempt is one to encourage sharing, which in community may incentivise ideas to find the light of observation to stimulate and further develop the subject.  I welcome feedback to either improve or correct any of my suppositions, and promote the subject further!

**Edit** - Thank you all so much for sharing the knowledge and insight.  Between the information garnered here as well as my own research, I've been able to much better mold myself to understand this concept sufficient that I'm much more comfortable to embrace what it is and how it effects us.

The earth's age was so important to Darwin that he conducted his own geological studies to estimate it. Most geologists at the time concurred with Darwin's estimates.

In 1862, physicist, [Sir William Thomson (later, Lord Kelvin)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin) writes [this paper, ""On the Age of the Sun’s Heat""](http://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/on_the_age_of_the_suns_heat.html). In it he meticulously argues that the sun probably formed as a giant gas cloud collapsing under gravitation. The collapsing molecules would yield kinetic energy which would manifest as heat energy.  Lord Kelvin's best guess for the age of the sun based on thermodynamic principles known at the time was 30 million years, nowhere near enough time for evolution to occur. Darwin was deeply concerned by the analysis describing it as one of his ""sorest troubles"".

Lord Kelvin's estimate was the best answer science had available at the time. Yet his whole analysis was made obsolete when a new form of energy via radioactivity was [discovered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactivity#Discovery) at the end of the 19th Century. The sun, and consequently the earth, could be in fact, many billions of years old. 

The whole fascinating saga is detailed in **[this 1989 Scientific American article, ""The Age of the Earth Debate""](http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~pkoch/EART_206/09-0108/Badash%2089%20SciAmer.pdf)** by [Lawrence Badash](http://www.history.ucsb.edu/people/person.php?account_id=58). Badash wrote :
&gt; Above all, the age-of-the-earth controversy illustrates that emotion, intuition and vested interests can direct the course of science almost as much as logic and experimentation.

Evolution was well and truly on the back foot and it could provide no new novel predictions to trump the claims. How would the claim ""there must be some much more abundant energy source in the sun that we don't even know about"" have sounded to you at the time?

Disclaimer : First of all, let me be frank. Godelian-incompleteness is the least of your worries as a human being. We are all walking around with a bunch of inconsistent beliefs and nobody has yet disappeared in a logical puff of internal inconsistency, so I hope this doesn't inspire anybody to believe that Godel actually matters to their every day existence.

[Strict finitism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitism). That's the answer. Believe that there is a largest finite integer. You don't even have to specify that number. Just say something like ""Let H be the largest integer ever representable by any computer in the next [googol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol) years. I believe that there is no greater integer than H^(H^(H^(H^(H^(H^(H^H))))))"". Append this belief (carefully) to your rules of arithmetic. Congratulations, your rules of arithmetic are now consistent and complete and suffer none of the Godelian ailments. Why? Because any arithmetic statement can be decided true or false merely by testing every single possibility of integers for any of the variables in the statement. Finite decision procedure. No sneaky [Godel numbering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering) into some mystic realm beyond your numerical horizon possible. No more nights spent in bus shelters having discovered your [local Grand Hotel was actually finite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel). 
You can now stop having nightmares about zombie Austrian logicians undermining the confidence in your decisions. It's as simple as that. Ever wondered why computer manufacturers don't offer Godelian incompleteness virus detection? Your computer is a strict finitist. As such, it is probably the most consistent and complete mathematical reasoner you know (except for possibly the electricity switch next to your computer). 

Finitism in general is a mathematically anti-realist position - rejecting the independent existence of mathematical objects and believing they are nothing more than human constructions. Wittgenstein was certainly a mathematical anti-realist and [some say, strict finitist](http://www.scribd.com/doc/26583558/Wittgenstein-s-Remarks-on-the-Foundation-of-Mathematics). Aristotle was [somewhat on the fence](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-mathematics/#12). An interesting debate broke out in the 30s between Bertrand Russell in his [Limits of Empiricism](http://www.scribd.com/full/26582511?access_key=key-ireknn0xhjhew6bs0ry) and the finitist, Alice Ambrose (see her [Finitism and the Limits of Empiricism](http://www.docstoc.com/docs/24856280/finitism). The debate between finitists and non-finitists usually seems to revolve around whether mathematical objects ""exist"" independent of the human mind. Personally I think strict finitism is all humans will ever need to understand any real-world phenomenon, although using concepts of infinity sometimes makes the math easier. I just don't get hung up on questions of mathematical existence.

For a detailed discussion of strict finitism as a foundation of mathematics, I found the [PhD thesis of Jim Mawby](http://theses.gla.ac.uk/1344/01/2005mawbyphd.pdf) from the University of Glasgow quite illuminating.

So what say the philosophers, scientists and mathematicians? Is infinity ""real""? Do mathematical objects exist?

I was re-reading Nassim Taleb's book [""The Black Swan""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan_(Taleb_book\)) when I came across this passage describing where Islamic and Christian attitudes towards science diverged in the 12th Century :

*The eleventh-century Arabic-language skeptic Al-Ghazali, known in Latin as Algazel wrote a diatribe called Tahafut al falasifa, which I translate as ""The Incompetence of Philosophy."" It was directed at the school called falasifah — the Arabic intellectual establishment was the direct heir of the classical philosophy of the academy, and they managed to reconcile it with Islam through rational argument.*

*Algazel's attack on ""scientific"" knowledge started a debate with Averroës, the medieval philosopher who ended up having the most profound influence of any medieval thinker (on Jews and Christians, though not on Moslems). The debate between Algazel and Averroës was finally, but sadly, won by both. In its aftermath, many Arab religious thinkers integrated and exaggerated Algazel's skepticism of the scientific method, preferring to leave causal considerations to God (in fact it was a stretch of his idea). The West embraced Averroës's rationalism, built upon Aristotle's, which survived through Aquinas and the Jewish philosophers who called themselves Averroan for a long time. Many thinkers blame the Arabs' later abandonment of scientific method on Algazel's huge influence. He ended up fueling Sufi mysticism, in which the worshipper attempts to enter into communion with God, severing all connections with earthly matters.*

[Averroes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes) turns out to be a thinker of immense impact in astronomy, physics, philosophy, law, medicine, logic, politics, psychology and more.  His school of philosophy, [Averroism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroism) became the dominant school of thought in Western Europe right up until the 16th Century. 

Among [his numerous contributions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes#Contributions) to knowledge was his description of force and inertia which Galileo himself rejected but was ultimately adopted by Newton. Some consider him the first existentialist philosopher. [In one work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes#Significance), he provided a justification for the emancipation of science and philosophy from the official theology. 

The debate between Averroes and [Algazel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali) was captured in two books. Algazel's attack on philosophy [""The Incoherence of the Philosophers""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incoherence_of_the_Philosophers) can be read in full [here](http://www.ghazali.org/works/taf-eng.pdf). Averroes reply is called [""The Incoherence of the Incoherence""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incoherence_of_the_Incoherence) and is available in full [here](http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ir/tt/index.html). Islam embraced Algazel's teachings and rejected Averroes and has never recovered.

Essential influences are Hume, Mach and Poincare in that order. Draws extensively from Einstein's own autobiographical writings, essays, as well as his extensive interviews with [Max Wertheimer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wertheimer), a founder of [Gestalt psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology).

What is plainly clear is that Einstein's philosophical readings were essential to his eventual rejection of time as absolute. For example, this from his own words :
&gt; One sees that in this paradox the germ of the special relativity theory is
already contained. Today everyone knows, of course, that all attempts to
clarify this paradox satisfactorily were condemned to failure as long as the
axiom of the absolute character of time, viz., of simultaneity, unrecognisedly
was anchored in the unconscious. Clearly to recognise this axiom and its
arbitrary character really implies already the solution of the problem. The
type of critical reasoning which was required for the discovery of this central
point was decisively furthered, in my case, especially by the reading of
David Hume's and Ernst Mach's philosophical writings.

Albert Einstein. 1949.",60,8,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/1c4thu/the_reciprocal_relationship_of_epistemology_and/,"Full quote : 

""The reciprocal relationship of epistemology and science is of noteworthy kind. They are dependent upon each other. Epistemology without contact with science becomes an empty scheme. Science without epistemology is - insofar as it is thinkable at all - primitive and muddled. 

However, no sooner has the epistemologist, who is seeking a clear system, fought his way through to such a system, than he is inclined to interpret the thought-content of science in the sense of his system and to reject whatever does not fit into his system. The scientist, however, cannot afford to carry his striving for epistemological systematic that far. He accepts gratefully the epistemological conceptual analysis; but the external conditions, which are set for him by the facts of experience, do not permit him to let himself be too much restricted in the construction of his conceptual world by the adherence to an epistemological system. He therefore must appear to the systematic epistemologist as a type of unscrupulous opportunist: he appears as realist insofar as he seeks to describe a world independent of the acts of perception; as idealist insofar as he looks upon the concepts and theories as free inventions of the human spirit (not logically derivable from what is empirically given); as positivist insofar as he considers his concepts and theories justified only to the extent to which they furnish a logical representation of relations among sensory experiences. He may even appear as Platonist or Pythagorean insofar as he considers the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research.""

We had an overwhelmingly awesome response to [the survey questionnaire](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/dgrw6/please_participate_in_our_first_ever/) with 244 completed surveys (and still counting). If you want to look at some elementary analysis done on the results, [check here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/dgrw6/please_participate_in_our_first_ever/c104u0b).

The response really took us by surprise. Had anticipated more like 50 responses. I chose text box free-form answer form thinking it would be easy to collate the results manually. User Pas__ suggested to crowdsource the analysis using an implementation strategy [described here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/dgrw6/please_participate_in_our_first_ever/c1070qk).

What this would mean is that we would make public the entire spreadsheet of answers minus the answers to three questions - the where do you live question, the tell us about your personal philosophy question, and the comments and suggestions question. These questions would be removed to preserve privacy of some of the personal responses we received, and to protect remote chance of identification. (**EDIT: We have replaced all locality information by country only. We have removed all University and location details. We would like to keep the personal philosophy answers in, as well as the suggestions answers. But we will remove the question about profession/jobs.** They have been scanned for identifying information.) There would be no other identifying information such as username and IP address.

How do people feel about this? It would possibly give us a chance to see some analysis and results from different perspectives, rather than the limited summary we are able to provide manually. Maybe releasing **all** of the data including the three questions is ok with people too?

If you have any comments/suggestions/objections please raise them in this thread so we can all discuss.

Soft mindedness has often invaded the ranks of religion. This is why religion has sometimes rejected new truth with a dogmatic passion. Through edicts and bulls, inquisitions and excommunications, the church has attempted to prorogue truth and place an impenetrable stone wall in the path of the truth-seeker. The historical-philogical criticism of the Bible is considered by the softminded as blasphemous, and reason is often looked upon as the exercise of a corrupt faculty. Softminded persons have revised the Beatitudes to read, ""Blessed are the pure in ignorance: for they shall see God.""

All of this has lead to the widespread belief that there is a conflict between science and religion. But this is not true. There may be a conflict between softminded religionists and toughminded scientists, but not between science and religion. Their respective worlds are different and their methods are dissimilar. Science investigates; religion interprets. Science gives man knowledge which is power; religion deals mainly with values. The two are not rivals. They are complementary. Science keeps religion from sinking into the valley of crippling irrationalism and paralyzing obscurantism. Religion prevents science from falling into the marsh of obsolete materialism and moral nihilism.

In **[this 1983 BBC interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMFPe-DwULM)**, he was asked why two magnets repel each other. Feynman was initially dismissive in his response. When pushed, he launched into a philosophical discussion about how the appropriate answer to ""why"" questions depends on who is asking and the context of the question.

I saw the new [Sherlock Holmes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_\(2009_film\)) movie last night and thought the whole Holmes business was interesting as historical scientific fiction. Chuckled at a few gems of philosophy-of-science wisdom that Holmes educates Watson with. His strict adherence to the facts, eye for detail and rejection of [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) strikes you initially as a hardcore empiricist - a [Baconian scientist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baconian_method). Yet he routinely develops hypotheses which seem to go beyond the evidence (particularly in regards to Watson's girlfriend) in rationalist fashion. Wanting to see just what style of reasoning Holmes' was using in making inferences, I accepted the case and duly began the investigation.

[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle), who was himself a medical practioner described Holmes as not much more than a ""calculating machine"". Here are some [relevant classic quotes from Sherlock Holmes novels](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes) which typify his philosophical position on scientific questions. In [A Study in Scarlet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Study_in_Scarlet), Holmes clearly sounds like an empiricist stating  : *""it is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment""*.  In the same novel, perhaps the extent of his rationality is defined : *""when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbably, must be the truth""*.  In [The Boscombe Valley Mystery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boscombe_Valley_Mystery), he sounds very Kuhnian stating: *""Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing ... It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different.""""* Holmes seems to believe that observation needn't be theory-laden if the scientist has the right mindset. In [The Adventure of the Cardboard Box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_of_the_cardboard_box), he states *""We approached the case ... with an absolute blank mind, which is always an advantage. We formed no theories. We were simply there to observe""*. Yet in [The Five Orange Pips](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Orange_Pips), he reasons *""As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after.""*

**[The author of this paper](http://www.ifets.info/journals/10_1/16.pdf)** believes that Holmes uses a style of reasoning known as [abductive reasoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning). The canonical example of abductive reasoning is as follows:

&gt; Rule: All the beans from this bag are white.

&gt; Result: These beans are white.

&gt; Case: Therefore, these beans are from this bag.

While the inference is of course not logically valid, it is pragmatically very powerful and convincing in the right circumstances. A historically important example : the data that
Kepler had about the longitudes and latitudes of Mars’ revolutions around the sun suggested a finite number of
geometrical curves from which to choose. Kepler’s hypothesis was that the orbit is elliptical, which he then
corroborated against the available evidence. More on abduction [here](http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html).

**It's worth asking the questions - in what circumstances is abduction a legitimate form of reasoning? Why does deriving hypotheses from consequents often prove so pragmatically useful despite the logical fallacy of [deducing the antecedent from the consequent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent)?**



As Holmes once said :

*To let the brain work without sufficient material is like racing an engine. It racks itself to pieces.*

-----

Incidentally I also discovered a book called *[Fact and feeling: Baconian science and the nineteenth-Century literary](http://www.amazon.com/Fact-Feeling-19Th-Century-Imagination-Literature/dp/0299143503)* pretty much confirms that Sherlock Holmes was meant to be the epitome of the Baconian scientist. **[This passage at pages 215-216 is a must read for Holmes fans](http://books.google.com/books?id=hFn1Zx_desIC&amp;lpg=PP13&amp;ots=MCZuIGWL4P&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA215#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false)**. This book's basic theme is that several 19th Century literary figures paved the way in the public mind for scientific supremacy by bringing together reason and imagination. Will have more on the Baconian method in a followup post.

EDIT: Oh and by the way, for those who want to know whether the movie is worth seeing? Well I enjoyed the triumph of tough science over dogmatic manipulative mysticism. Robert Downey Jr was a more true-to-the-books Sherlock than the standard image of the guy with the funny hat and cape but the interplay with Watson wasn't entirely convincing.

In one part, van Fraassen responds to Grover Maxwell's assertion that there is no such thing as in principle unobservable entities (partially because the observation-theoretical dichotomy is so vague). van Fraassen says that, although *unobservable* is a ""vague predicate"", it's usable so long as it has a clear case and a clear counter-case. He then claims that it's obvious *observable* has a clear case, then gives the example of how we infer the existence of a particle in a cloud chamber even though we didn't directly observe it as a clear counter case. This example isn't entirely compelling for me. 

I've checked the Googles (and other places), and haven't been able to find examples of what van Fraassen considers an in principle unobservable object or event.

It seems sometimes that its the historians who are the ones who really know what science is all about. 

A few days ago, the journal ISIS released a special edition about the historiography of alchemy whose articles are all available for free. [They can be viewed and downloaded here](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/660127) (in the Focus section). 

The standout work is [Lawrence Principe](http://krieger.jhu.edu/singleton/faculty-directory/principe.html)'s ""Alchemy Restored"" which is well worth the read.  The concluding paragraph is, in my view, golden. 

&gt; Alchemy’s exclusion illustrates strategic redefinitions of science, while its rehabilitation points to the contextual nature of those definitions. One gift offered by the history of science is the recognition that science is a far messier process than simple models, wishful thinking, or programmatic philosophies will allow. It collects elements from unexpected sources and synthesizes them in unexpected and unpredictable ways. It is never a mechanical or impersonal process—nor would we want it to be. While the laws of nature exist independently of us, the ways we choose to conceive of them, to explore or not to explore them, to describe or not to describe them—that is to say, science—is a very human affair, filled with all the complexities and simplicities, errors and insights, pettiness and
nobility that customarily attend human activity. And, to be sure, alchemy forms an important part of that story.

Another historian, Will Thomas, describes the importance of this new work in alchemy to historiography in [this blog post](http://etherwave.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/how-to-run-a-historiography-or-chymistry-rides-high/).

It is probably a bit contentious putting this up but it *is* missing three parts. So if you want the whole series you will have to buy it from the Teaching Company.  The link to the Teaching Company course with full description of lectures is [here](http://www.teach12.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=1440) (try waiting for the very generous discounts they announce periodically). It is presented by [Professor Judith Grabiner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Grabiner) of Pitzer (edit) College. It's also hosted on a Russian site, so well, you know, take all necessary precautions.

If you're not that interested in probability and stats and want to explore more of the philosophy and history of mathematics, you could probably skip lectures 2 to 13. Lectures 14 onwards focus on geometry.

Other awesome courses from the Teaching Company include [Philosophy of Science](http://www.teach12.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=4100) and [Science Wars: What Scientists Know and How They Know It](http://www.teach12.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=1235).

Hello all, I just overhauled my subreddit subscriptions in the hope that I could begin engaging reddit for meaningful discourse that improves my life rather than mindless humor that distracts me from it. My goal is to create at least one meaningful discussion in each of the subreddits that interested me and Philosophy of Science was on the top of the list. I am familiar with the subject but not with the content of the subreddit so if this topic has been covered already, I did a quick search and found nothing, I apologize and hope to be directed to that discussion.

The topic at hand is the definition, or perhaps composition, of what is meant by “objective”. I have often heard science championed among the intellectual fields due to its “objective verifiability” and seen other fields that seemed just as important, say interpersonal communication, spirituality, and oh hell home economics, criticized for their lack of objective verifiability and basically treated as willy nilly opinions or outright hogwash despite their utility to me individually and others I know.

The foundation of science being in “objective verifiability” to me is in the extreme untenable or at least needing clarification and perhaps a name change. To me objectivity cannot exist, at least in a typical human consciousness, because at a very base level any human experience is undeniably subjective. A scientist looking through a telescope or a microscope is having an experience, even if that experience is the pursuit of scientific knowledge, and that experience is filtered through all of their past experiences, opinions, beliefs and all the other various elements that make up a human's uniqueness.

Now in science we verify each others claims by following the same procedure as others have and see if we find the same results. I don't deny verification, I believe it is essential. What I struggle with is the assertion that somehow through an arbitrary number of individual subjective experiences of following a process and finding the same results we are somehow able to universalize it and say it is objectively true (with perhaps some qualifications of parameters). 

Perhaps I can use an example to illustrate my dilemma. I can lift up an object and let go of it, and see it fall, thus observing the effects of gravity. I can ask other people to engage in this and they will verify my findings and I understand that people have been observing this phenomena for quite a long time and we have all come to a consensus that any object released will in fact fall towards the center of the earth. Yet to me this still is not “objectively true” at most it is a worldly consensus, but more accurately a consensus among those that have thought about it and tested it. Yet we still take that step and universalize and “objectify” what to me is really just a consensus among similar subjective experiences. 

Where it gets really tricky is when we apply science to technology. Technology works because science is valid, yet we cannot honestly say that our science is universally true as we do not have a universal perspective from which to base this assertion; we have subjective perspectives and the ability to communicate them and reach a working consensus. This becomes a snake eating its own tail for me because I cannot deny the concrete utility of technology, but I can also not deny my fundamental doubts about the “objectivity” of our scientific theories.

To me, for something to be “objectively verified” all possible perspectives would have to observe and verify it so as to transcend the individuality of each instance of verification, but then we run into problems of communication between each instance and how any communicative system has an inherent distortion upon what is being communicated. So for it to be truly “objective” all perspectives would have to be experienced within one consciousness and now we are on the brink of leaving this subreddits scope and entering into topics of consciousness, being and spirituality.

Since we deal with the intersection of philosophy and science, our threads here seem to be a magnet for the following argument:

1.  Everybody knows that the only rational form of inquiry is science.
2.  Science requires empirical reasoning from data.

In short, I'd like to be able to point people to a page of links, or a comment thread, or something, and be able to say ""Here.  If you aren't convinced by *any* of these arguments, then I just don't know what to tell you, enough said.""  I'd even be happy to host such a link collection on my professional website.

Quantum suicide, quantum casino and quantum immortality.",52,9,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/dunhy/to_the_many_worlds_quantum_theorists_place_your/,"[Max Tegmark](http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/), a student of famous quantum physicist [John Wheeler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler), proposed a thought experiment to test the [many worlds interpretation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) of quantum mechanics. You hook a gun up to a device which measures the spin value of a photon. Every few seconds, the spin value of a passing photon is measured. Depending on the orientation of the photon's spin, the gun is activated, otherwise it isn't. You hold the gun to your head and let it run. Since you would only ever be conscious of the times when the gun wasn't deployed, you could survive in a Universe where the gun never fires and where you therefore knew with a very high level of certainty that the many worlds interpretation was the correct one. More information on the experiment can be found on [this page](http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/quantum.html) on Tegmark's website a little way down in an article called ""Dying to Know"". Original paper available [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9709032/). Hear Max Tegmark talk about it in the second half of [this video interview](http://www.closertotruth.com/video-profile/Why-is-the-Quantum-so-Strange-Max-Tegmark-/893). Wikipedia page [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality). Presumably you could run the experiment under controlled experimental conditions and publish the results, and earn a Nobel Prize in the Universe in which you survive.

Now for my addition. From there, you could create a machine which measured the spin of five different passing photons. Converting the binary representation of the five spin measurements, you could come up with a number between 0 and 31. You call this number through to a friend sitting at a highrollers roulette wheel and he bets your life savings on that number. Your friend relays the number over the phone which activates a machine to fire a gun pointed at your head if and only if your number doesn't come up. Repeat the process. Eventually you and your friend would survive in a world where you have innumerable wealth and live happily ever after. (Ok you don't need the binary stuff - you could just bet odd or even - but you would have to endure more spins).

There is also the intriguing issue of quantum immortality. One variation of this concept (at least I think it's a variation) I thought of is that if you can never perceive your own death, isn't it likely that all of us will live forever in our own personal Universes? Wouldn't there exist a Universe in which atomic processes proceeded so as to reverse the aging process of our body and this is the only Universe we will ever be aware of?

Einstein was 41 years old. The [Eddington experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity#Deflection_of_light_by_the_Sun) had whipped up much public excitement about the apparent success of general relativity. Yet Einstein was now facing the fiercest criticism to date - some of it scientific, some of it personal. One of his early scientific heroes, [Phillip Lenard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Lenard) who had won the Nobel Prize for cathode ray research in 1905, had come out staunchly against relativity. Lenard had also associated himself with the notorious [Paul Weyland](http://www.physik.uni-halle.de/Fachgruppen/history/weyland.htm) a scientific nobody, whose public attacks against Einstein were clearly racially motivated. Einstein, to his friends' and mentors' dismay, countered the attacks with an astounding personal attack of his own, writing in a newspaper piece that Lenard *""had so far achieved nothing in theoretical physics and his objections to the general theory of relativity are of such superficiality that until now I had thought it unnecessary to answer them in detail"".* Relations had clearly fallen off a cliff since their [earlier mutually admiring communication](http://www.physik.uni-halle.de/Fachgruppen/history/9_sum.htm).

The stage was set for a showdown. Einstein scheduled a debate with Lenard on September 23, 1920 in Bad Nauheim in southwestern Germany. What ensued was a clash of incommensurable epistemologies and egos. **[The text of the debate and thoughts of observers can be read here](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Bad_Nauheim_Debate)**. There was no clear winner. As [Kuhn pointed out several decades later](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift#Kuhnian_paradigm_shifts), there is no experiment that can decisively break the shackles of an entrenched scientific mindset. The old guard must simply die out.

Einstein lost his cool towards the end of the debate, sharply snapping at Lenard while protesters in the audience chanted slogans. Max Planck quickly and tactfully brought the debate to an end, quipping *""Since the relativity theory unfortunately has not yet made it possible to extend the absolute time interval available for the meeting, our session must be adjourned.""*

Phillip Lenard went on to found the racially driven movement in Germany called [Deutsche Physik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Physik).

------------

**I. Luria's work on literacy**

This post is about the work of the Russian psychologist A. R. Luria on preliterate Uzbek communities and some radical theories about epistemology.

&gt;...once one has acquired descriptive language, one not only a subject but also an object for oneself - an object about which one can reflect, which one may criticize and change, and thus transcend. Self-transcendence, a familiar characteristic of human life, is attained largely by the reflective criticism and examination of the theories that hold the self together; by the destruction of some of those theories; and by the creation of new theories in their place. (p.63)

Luria noted in *[The Cognitive Development: Its Cultural and Social Foundations](http://books.google.com/books?id=ZQX2WmMJUMcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=a.r.+luria&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ncBdTIHSJoGClAfX56yZCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)* that literacy *changed the structure of the brain* in as much a revolutionary way as the change between pre-linguistic and linguistic communities.

Luria found that, on average, before an individual had gone through the  training to treat physical markings as abstractly symbolizing or representing an idea or concept (you know, *learning to read*), individuals were (1) concrete in their judgments, (2) magical in their thinking (asserted a mind was behind some course of events), and (3) use-based.

*After* only a year of training in literacy, the individual became (1') conceptual, abstract thinkers that objectified their knowledge, (2') non-magical (asserted that a mind did not necessarily direct an event), and (3') category-based. There were other changes, some just as drastic, but these three, along with one more change, are what interest me the most. 

**II. Hear me out ...**

I should explain. Luria noted that when providing deductive arguments tailored to a cultural setting, subjects would occasionally make the cognitive inference, but then immediately amend this inference by asserting that they had not *personally* observed such an event, and could provide no conclusions. 

Formal logic is a relatively modern invention, developed from the Greek culture’s internalization of reading. The illiterate subjects were given simple deductive statements, such as, ""Up North where there is snow, the bears are white. A city up North always has snow. What color are the bears"" A typical response was: “You find what color bears are by looking at him. Whoever heard of reasoning out of practical life the color of a polar bear? Besides, how am I sure that you know for sure that all bears are white in a snowy country?” This went on and on to such lengths that reading Luria's work, while quite interesting in their own right, sounds a bit repetitious, for after eight or nine examples of individuals repeatedly refusing to make the cognitive leap when dealing with places they have not directly experienced, Luria simply gives up in frustration.

These preliterate people treated the phenomenal state acquired through the use of sight, smell, taste, and touch, to be the only available option.

**III. Abstraction**

This concreteness extended to such things as sorting objects: the illiterate subjects tested by Luria refused to deal in abstractions. When shown drawings of four items, with three belonging to a logical category and the fourth not part of the category, *literate* subjects correctly removed the card that did not belong. However, the illiterate subjects thought of the groups not in categorical terms, but in practical terms. For instance, when a peasant was shown a log, hatchet, saw and hammer, he said, ""They're all alike. The saw will saw the log; the hatchet will chop it. If one of these has to go, I'd throw out the hatchet. It doesn't do as good a job as a saw."" This extended to sorting and providing names to colors and abstract shapes.

For instance, when shown figures that were abstract in shape - such as circles or squares - those that were illiterate gave them names of concrete objects found around the farm. To someone who was illiterate, a circle was described as a 'plate' or 'moon'; a square was described as a 'door' or 'window'. Colors were given names that related to the environment around them, and their use of abstract colors were limited. Something was up.

Thus, it’s clear that literacy leads to a significant change in the structure of the brain, which brings with it abstraction, new logical categories, and the ability to understand a deductive, rather than evidentiary, argument. The logic of preliterate culture is additive rather than causal; situational and concrete rather than abstract. If the method of grouping changes from practical to logical terms with literacy, the changes that take place in the brain through literacy sounds like an absolute requirement for the development of science. 

The objectification of our ideas is a recent invention that occurred at several points throughout history, but made the strongest through literacy. Literacy makes *objective* or *abstract* our subjective mental states and beliefs in symbol-form. Literate individuals experience conceptual or abstract ideas external to the mind, providing different categories and *ways* of categorization. They can *reflect on* and *criticize*, in much the same way that one can reflect on and criticize the ideas of others, an individual's previously-held ideas. In a sense, the literate individual can make their private language or inner-monologue *public*, even if it is only available to that same individual at a later time. Literacy makes the world of ideas, previously only having an indirect influence on our emotional or cognitive states, have a *direct* influence on our cognitive states by way of *understanding* the relationship between symbols -- scratchings on parchment or clay tablets -- and what is symbolized.

**IV. Symbols**

This is a gradual transformation, especially in the symbols used, and their historical transformation from literal or representational to nonliteral and phonetic. The word 'bird' does not look like a bird, but the first symbols used were pictorial representations of objects.

&gt; ...theoretical language provides man with an opportunity that permits him to dissociate from, to detach from, to objectify and to alienate himself from his own subjective states: to make them into objects, not identified with himself, which may then be examined. This process of examining such objects is one of renderings them strange, and of passing beyond a merely subjective relationship with them. This approach allows us to ""have done with"" some subjective states, to pass beyond them, to become free of them, to transcend them. (p.64)

Literacy begins a cascading series of events: we share 95% of our genetic material with chimpanzees, yet the differences between the two is immense. Why haven't some of the improvements occurred in chimpanzees?  The chimpanzee-level task of modeling others, which led in one species of hominid to increased modeling, which enabled language, which birthed a whole new level of competition between individuals, that of oratory, that led to sexual selection... or something like that.

**V. One more thing...**

Oh, and that other thing that changed in individuals that learned to read? This part just blows my mind: they were full of questions. Luria attempted one experiment where in casual conversation he would ask preliterate individuals to ask *him* questions about the world: where he came from, what cities were like, etc. However, these individuals were uninterested in asking these questions, saying things like 'We were just discussing crops. Could you tell me how to make our crops grow better?' *Literate* individuals were overflowing with questions about all manner of things: places, people, things, countries, politics, etc. A world was opened up to them through the written word and they wanted to know *more*.

Some commenters have found Luria's findings dubious. I've pulled up several recent studies on literacy changing the structure of thought. The last article is, I think, the most interesting, since it refers to a little-known study that replicated most of the findings of Luria's experiment in an African community.

Averroes again.",50,10,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/cca9a/when_muslims_christians_and_jews_worked_together/,"One of the places I visited on my recent trip to Europe was [Cordoba, Spain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3rdoba,_Spain#History) to see the stomping grounds of the great 12th Century Muslim philosopher/scientist/judge, [Averroes](http://kirjasto.sci.fi/averro.htm) (aka Ibn Rushd). ([Previously](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/aig46/today_i_learned_that_the_person_who_introduced/)).

This was an extraordinary period of time and place in history when [Muslims, Christians and Jews worked together](http://books.google.com/books?id=iDDhaR9btpcC) on philosophy and science and when philosophy had equal status as a path to the truth as religion did. Sadly, not long after, the Christians expelled the Muslims, converted [Averroes' mosque to a church](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rE2TxJiFqE), and a little while later instigated the Spanish Inquisition to weed out infidels. The only tribute in Cordoba to Averroes, a statue [(crap video I made here)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7nj7PF95M) was actually erected by Jews and is based in the Jewish quarter of Cordoba. Ultimately, Averroes was far more influential among Christians and Jews than he was with Muslims. Even to this day, his works are [banned in Syria](http://www.vivagranada.com/greatmoors/index.htm). 

I don't think Averroes was an atheist, but his views are so out of line with fundamentalist Islamic thinking, I can see why many Muslims considered him such, and why he was banished for a time during his lifetime. He believed that the truth could be reached via philosophical reflection (independently of revelation). This was not an uncommon view by the Islamic elite and powerful at that time. For him though,
the Qur'an was like a Discovery Channel documentary - a dumbed down, imagery-packed version of the truth for the masses who couldn't grasp the truth through philosophy. For him, the Universe had no beginning and no creator and God was a non-interfering observer (kind of like the laws of physics). When we die, our imaginations and our individual selves also die but our intellect lives on as part of the global collective intellect (one scholar in the **BBC podcast below** described this concept as being like ""the internet"").

Historically, I think Averroes was influential in Western Europe because of his enlightened commentaries of Aristotle which were translated into Latin and read by thinkers such as [Thomas Aquinas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz_iGGGMddw#t=30s). Aquinas also had the goal of reconciling Aristotlean thought with Christian thinking. Averroes' writings triggered a break-away group in Venice whose acceptance of Averroean ideas of death of the individual self, contradicted Christian teachings of mortal responsibility and post-death punishment. It was probably this sort of tension between theology and philosophy that eventually led to secularity.

We can only wonder at what stage science (and humanity) would be now if civilisation had chosen Averroes' science/philosophy path to truth back then.

These are just my own impressions of Averroes and his philosophy which I think find support in this **[BBC ""In Our Time"" episode](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0038x79) (recommended!)** and this [peer-review internet encyclopedia entry](http://www.iep.utm.edu/ibnrushd/).

A lesson from his passion for Mayan astronomy.,45,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/dpy6x/more_on_the_philosophy_of_science_of_richard/,"Richard Feynman during his time in Mexico became very interested in Mayan hieroglyphics and astronomy. He delivered a lecture at Caltech about it.  This excerpt of the lecture is from the biography of Feynman called [Genius](http://www.amazon.com/Genius-Life-Science-Richard-Feynman/dp/0679747044) by James Gleick. It seems to show Feynman wrestling with his operationalist view of science.

---

Consider a Mayan astronomer, he suggested. The Maya had a theory of astronomy that enabled them to explain their observations and to make predictions long into the future. It was a *theory* in the utilitarian modern spirit: a set of rules, quite mechanical, which when followed produced accurate results. Yet it seemed to lack a kind of understanding. ""They counted a certain number and subtracted some numbers, and so on,"" he said. ""There was no discussion of what the moon was. There was no discussion even of the idea that it went around.""

Now a ""young man"" approaches the astronomer with a new idea. What if there are balls of rock out there, far away, moving under the influences of forces just like the forces that pull rocks to the ground? Perhaps it would make possible a different way of calculating the motions of the heavenly bodies. (Feynman certainly had memories of a young man confronting his elders with new, half-formed physical intuitions.)

&gt; ""Yes."" says the astronomer, ""and how accurately can you predict eclipses?"" He says, ""I haven't developed the thing very far yet."" Then says the astronomer, ""Well, we can calculate eclipses more accurately than you can with your model, so you must not pay any attention to your idea because obviously the mathematical scheme is better.""

---

Contrast this with this  **[must-watch video of an earlier lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TI1M3abAM8)** where Feynman displays his earlier thinking on the Mayans. Feynman is making a philosophical point here about the role of philosophy in forming modern scientific theories - scientists don't ask ""why"".

Gleick suggests this later lecture is an indication of Feynman's discomfort later in life with the anti-philosophical, instrumentalist view of science that he carried with him most of his career - that the only thing that mattered about a scientific theory was its ability to produce numbers agreeing with experiment. This view and the rejection of philosophy was widespread among quantum physicists who believed that nothing beyond the [Copenhagen interpretation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation) of quantum mechanics could ever be known and that philosophising beyond the data was a waste of time.",,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,,True,t3_dpy6x,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/dpy6x/more_on_the_philosophy_of_science_of_richard/,

Einstein himself later stated that he had read them *""with breathless attention""*.

In one volume, Bernstein describes a thought experiment involving a speeding train and the constancy of the speed of light which likely influenced Einstein's [own thought experiment as a 16 year old](http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/Goodies/Chasing_the_light/index.html), and perhaps [those in his 1905 special relativity paper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity#Einstein.27s_train_thought_experiment). In another volume,  Bernstein speculated about the existence of gravity waves.  Like Einstein, Bernstein was also eager to tie together all of nature's forces. The philosophy of science underlying Bernstein's writings seemed to mirror Einstein's later scientific realism and trust in the power of rational thought over experiment. For example, Bernstein wrote of the discovery of Uranus: *""Praised be this science! Praised be the men who do it! And praised be the human mind, which sees more sharply than does the human eye.""*

**[Here is a passage (pp 18-19) from a recent biography of Einstein](http://books.google.com/books?id=cdxWNE7NY6QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)** which describes in more detail, the influence Bernstein's books had on his development.

&gt; What Eia had done, was to first interview the Norwegian social scientists on issues like sexual orientation, gender roles, violence, education and  race, which are heavily politicized in the Norwegian science community. Then he translated the interviews into English and took them to well-known British and American scientists like Robert Plomin, Steven Pinker, Anne Campbell, Simon Baron-Cohen, Richard Lippa, David Buss, and others, and got their comments. **To say that the American and British scientists were surprised by what they heard, is an understatement.**

[Norwegian brainwashing](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sv&amp;u=http://www.peterilli.se/2012/02/05/om-norsk-hjarntvatt/) 2/5/2012

&gt; I looked recently at the Norwegian popular science television series ""Brainwashing."" In seven sections the Norwegian comedian Harald Eia explores the degree to which various differences between people can be attributed to biological or social factors.

[Race Taboo on TV](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sv&amp;u=http://web.archive.org/web/00000000000000/http://www.dagsavisen.no/kultur/article480122.ece) 4/13/2010

&gt; We need to talk about taboo topics, without being branded as racists, say Shout editor Majoran Vivekananthan of ""Brainwashing"" fame.

[Gender research loses 56 million](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=no&amp;u=http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/Kjonnsforskningen-mister-56-millioner-6704899.html) 11/23/2011

&gt; For 17 years, gender research has been built up through its own research program in the Research Council. The last firårsperioden has been reduced by approx. 56 million for research in gender studies.

&gt; Last spring, Norwegian gender studied received massive criticism in connection with the NRK series Brainwashing. Trout believes part of the criticism has been real, and points out that there are many opinions about this even among sex researchers themselves. But the debate has damaged reputation of research.

[Great Interest in Brainwashing](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;u=http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/Kjempeinteresse-for-Hjernevask-5320246.html) 3/3/2010

&gt; Curious and enthusiastic TV viewers bombarded Harald Eia and Ole Martin Ihle with questions during the chat with Aftenposten.no readers.

[Ideological science](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=www.nt.se/nyheter/artikel.aspx?articleid=7462699) 2/4/2012

&gt; Are men more interested in sex than women? Some believe that this is true, some not. But what science says?

&gt; A person who has attempted to ascertain this is the Norwegian comedian and journalist Harald Eia. For more than a year since he took up this and several other sociological issues in a series of documentaries for NRK's ​​behalf. The series created a major debate about gender scientific culture. Now, during last autumn also put Norwegian counterpart to the Council closed its special focus on gender studies. Generally it is considered to be linked to EIAs TV programs.

##Update 2/23/2012

Today I Googled the host's name ""Harald eia"" and the word ""brainwash,"" and clicked ""Past month"" to see what had cropped up recently (the videos appeared with English subtitles two months ago).  The following results include a promising 4chan thread:

Alas, upon clicking [the link](http://boards.4chan.org/int/res/4835840), I am led to a 404:

&gt; It has often been said, and certainly not without justification, that the man of science is a poor philosopher. Why then should it not be the right thing for the physicist to let the philosopher do the philosophizing? Such might indeed be the right thing to do a time when the physicist believes he has at his disposal a rigid system of fundamental laws which are so well established that waves of doubt can't reach them; but it cannot be right at a time when the very foundations of physics itself have become problematic as they are now. At a time like the present, when experience forces us to seek a newer and more solid foundation, the physicist cannot simply surrender to the philosopher the critical contemplation of theoretical foundations; for he himself knows best and feels more surely where the shoe pinches. In looking for an new foundation, he must try to make clear in his own mind just how far the concepts which he uses are justified, and are necessities.

I realize that one can only hypothesize, but if there's anyone out there like me who enjoys thinking about these kinds of things, please contribute!
Here's what I've concluded so far: 1. They can most likely recognize that a concept of ""quantities"" exists. Quantities can be added to and subtracted from. If they are intelligent like us, they have probably concluded that concepts such as division and multiplication work as well.
Despite having these basic logic skills, they most certainly don't use an arabic number system like we do. Also, what is the chance they use base-10 like us? If you think about it, ""10 of something"" is completely arbitrary. Perhaps to this life form, a quantity of 13 is ""nice and even,"" just as 10 is an appealing number to us.
Now, with the basics covered, one can only begin to assume things... which brings up these questions:
Have they discovered algebra? Do they realize that they can figure out unknowns using basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division?
Have they discovered geometry? I have more confidence in this one, simply because the ability to recognize relationships between shapes seems easier to grasp than relationships between arbitrary quantities.
If no algebra / geometry, is there an alternative ""something"" that they've discovered that allow them to do and figure out advanced things using methods completely unknown to us? Is it possible that there are alternatives to algebra that we never even thought of? Algebra is so imbedded into our minds. Can we even wrap out minds around a different way of doing it?
Honestly, these questions can go on forever. If intelligent life exists that can do what we can do, if not more, then how are they making the ""calculations"" ? Again, it boggles my mind to think about this...

Video.,42,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/akfit/beyond_einstein_the_quest_for_unifying_theories/,"*Originally posted in [/r/PhilosophyofScience](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience).*

The [World Science Festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Science_Festival) is an annual event held in New York City which began in 2008. The event consists mostly of on-stage discussions and presentations by prominent scientists, philosophers and historians.

This discussion concerns ultimate unified explanations of physics. It's a little over an hour long. There is a large smattering of [string theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) (with one of the founders participating). The interesting philosophical discussion really gets going in Part 5. If you don't have the time for all parts, I recommend at least watching Part 8. 

The Youtube description of the discussion follows :

*Albert Einstein spent his last thirty years unsuccessfully searching for a 'unified theory' - a single master principle to describe everything in the universe, from tiny subatomic particles to immense clusters of galaxies. In the decades since, generations of researchers have continued working toward Einstein's dream.*

*Renowned physicists [Leonard Susskind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Susskind),
 [Janna Levin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janna_Levin),
 [Jim Gates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gates),
 and prominent historian [Peter Galison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Galison) discussed what's been achieved and tackled pivotal questions. Would a unified theory reveal why there is a universe at all? Would it tell us why mathematics is adept at unraveling nature's mysteries? Might it imply we are one universe of many, and what would that mean for our sense of how we fit into the cosmos? Moderated by Nobel Laureate [Paul Nurse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Nurse).*

of two successive queries posed by Leibniz in 1697 and 1714. He did so to lay the groundwork for
his explanatory theistic answer. But the present paper offers*

&gt; *(ii) My argument for the complete failure of his interrogative ontological challenge as a springboard for his and Richard Swinburne’s creationist theistic answer.*

&gt; *I argue under (i) that Leibniz’s explanatory demand is an ill-conceived non-starter which poses a pseudo issue. Thus, his and Swinburne’s case for divine creation miscarries altogether.

Recently I had a Internet Argument. At one point, the other person in the argument claimed that his proof was unassailable and certain, and that arguing *against* his proof constituted evidence for the proof. I find these kinds of argumentative tricks to be *prima facie* ridiculous and dangerous *if we are interested in learning from our mistakes*, but I think I ought to explain my feelings about them through use of a thought-experiment.

**I. The thought-experiment**

You are sitting next to a dogmatist on the train. After they get you with their religious hook (""Hey, did you know that you're going to burn forever in a lake of fire?""), you ask them how they know that they have the one true religion. They appeal to their holy book to justify the existence of their deity. You ask, *And how do you know that your holy book is right?* They respond by using the existence of their deity to justify the truth of their holy book. Their argument is unassailable!

Furthermore, by objecting to this proof, you implicitly support the existence of the deity, for *who* granted you the ability to reason? Their deity, that's who! Get down on your knees and *submit!*

**II. Dogmatist tactics**

If you step back and think for a moment, you'll see that the argument has internal and external objections: you might bring up apparent contradictions within the theory, or you might point out an apparent contradiction between the theory and some existential state of affairs.

In response, the dogmatist makes an *ad hoc* adjustment to some part of his or her system of theories. Science is *now* a conspiracy hiding the truth (modern creationists fit the bill), or a group of intertwined scientific theories are demonstrably false (but no one knows the truth but the dogmatist!), or one passage is allegorical while the other passage is literal, etc. If the dogmatist has the will and intelligence, it's easy for them to smooth over any bumps in the wallpaper.

Or, the dogmatist might take the criticism and interpret it as a personal affront, or redirect it back as an accusatory remark: *You just don't understand! You need to adopt my dogma in order to properly judge the dogma! You're not qualified! You just hate everything I say because you don't want to hear the truth!*

Sometimes, these steps involve changing the implicit meaning of commonly-used words as the conversation progresses (""It's absolutely true"" becomes ""It's true for me"") or claiming to know some secret rejoinder that they're unable to divulge to the uninitiated.

Or, the dogmatist might reject the criticism as heretical or blasphemous out of hand, preventing the criticism from being entertained by the dogmatist in the first place.

The dogmatist might unintentionally or intentionally misrepresent the criticisms, either through a lack of inquisitiveness or just plain maliciousness (trolls).

They might ask you to provide some reason for your criticism, and then a reason for *that* reason, and a reason for that ...

Of course, this list isn't exhaustive.

**III. A possible reason behind dogmatist tactics**

The dogmatist makes these maneuvers, I think, in order to insulate the core theory from criticism. The system of theories is changed in some way, usually by augmenting or striking out the theories on the periphery: the theories that are easily changed while still not threatening the core theory. Like an immunization shot, these surreptitious changes prevent infection from viruses that would weaken the core.

During the Cold War ""buffer zones"" prevented any full-frontal assault on either the US or the USSR. Yet, the *content* underlying these two countries were diametrically opposed when it came to ethics, politics, economics, and values. This tells us that *anyone* can use this argument to protect *any* core theory. Rather than dealing with the *content* of the core, this whole time you and the dogmatist are fighting over the ""buffer zones"" without ever getting a chance to address the core.

**IV. Methodological choices**

If the content of the core theory is irrelevant to its irrefutability, than the core is unassailable *because the arguer makes it unassailable*. 

The dogmatist makes some very specific methodological choices. For instance, they carefully remove any sort of empirical test from consideration. Or, they treat any sort of *a priori* criticism as misguided. Soon, the whole web is like a satellite that drifts out of orbit. It can't be reached by any empirical test. If it moves far enough, it becomes its own hermeneutic tradition, unwilling to listen to *any sort of criticism*.

A problem with this tactic, I think, is that any theory (true or false) can become closed. 

What does this behavior say about the relationship between the two people arguing (talking past one another) on the train? The dogmatist with the perfect argument thinks they are right and everyone else is wrong: they are like the parent lecturing children that just don't know any better. Since you are *not* a child, you might feel that your only option is to give up. 

**V. Treating people as equals**

I think this is a way to sabotage a conversation, for it treats people as unequal. There's no conversation to be had, even though it wears conversational garb. To make a biblical allusion, why is Satan thrown out of Heaven? Perhaps it is because he dared to treat God as an equal? Was it because he dared question God's plan? This example matters only in the sense that most dogmas state that criticism in-itself to be an act of heresy or treason. This says a great deal about Western culture with its affinity to violence.

Take the recent case of WikiLeaks and Cablegate (Why not? Everyone else is having a go!): releasing the documents is treason; WikiLinks questions the rightful authority of the State to go about its business; Julian Assange ought to be shot on sight; *so what* if the state has behaved unethically - or illegally - when the bogeyman is out *there*, not here; the members of WikiLeaks are rapists, anarchists and thieves; etc. In other words, governments around the world tell us to [pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZR64EF3OpA)

I think that there are two options available: as Assange has said in the recent *[Time](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2034040-1,00.html#ixzz17Fryw1HD)* interview,

&gt;""If their behavior is revealed to the public, [governments] have one of two choices: one is to reform in such a way that they can be proud of their endeavors, and proud to display them to the public. Or the other is to lock down internally and to balkanize, and as a result, of course, cease to be as efficient as they were. To me, that is a very good outcome, because organizations can either be efficient, open and honest, or they can be closed, conspiratorial and inefficient.""

**VI. Objection!**

There still is an objection (of sorts): I object on the grounds that the individual is making the theory unassailable. They block the assault by building ever more concentric walls around the city. Nothing can get in, but then nothing can get out. They're unwilling to change. There's no exchange of ideas anymore, since they're out to convert. When two dogmatists enter a conversation, this often leads to violence or subjugation. It becomes a matter of controlling others.

**VII. Why should anyone argue with someone that is unwilling to change?**

I think that by pointing out their stance they might realize their mistake in behavior and subsequently correct it. Oftentimes, people do not realize they have adopted these specific tactics; however, some people are unable to change. They enjoy the thought of holding dominion over others by sitting at the right hand of their God and State.

If someone isn't able to change, then the conversation on the train has, to some extent, been a waste; however, someone that is not dogmatic might learn new things, like where to donate their money in the future, or what policies to vote for, or who can be trusted. For instance, I've learned not to allow myself to get into arguments on trains, but in a more formal setting ... like a bar.

If the dogmatist corrects their behavior, it becomes a conversation between equals, where there is some give and take. This is both an ethical appeal and an epistemological imperative: *we make mistakes!* And *if* we make mistakes, I think the willingness to listen to others is far more conducive to error-correction than sticking to our guns. 

By and by, this is also the underlying ethical argument of Critical Rationalism, but you've probably come to expect as much coming from me. ;-)",,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,,True,t3_eh7e4,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/eh7e4/the_right_and_wrong_ways_to_argue/,

1313879721.0,35,self.PhilosophyofScience,jp6dx,What is the difference between a genuine counterexample to a theory and an anomaly which might later merit an explanation?,38,3,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/jp6dx/what_is_the_difference_between_a_genuine/,"/r/philofsci,

We are all familiar of the history of general relativity. The precession in the orbit of Mercury was viewed as a ""cloud on the horizon"" by the scientists of the 19th century. In other words, many thinkers expected that the precession was due to some as-yet-unexplained facet of the solar system which could be interpreted in the language of Newtonian physics. But as we all know, it turned out to be a genuine counterexample to Newtonian physics, which required that we build a new theory of gravity from the ground up.

However, the recently-solved Pioneer Anomaly was just that--an anomaly which is now finding its explanation in the mechanics of solar wind and the shape of the spacecraft. Rather than requiring a new theoretical framework, the Pioneer Anomaly has been successfully explained in the context of GR and existing knowledge of solar wind.

At what point does an anomaly become a true counterexample? Sorry if this is a naive question, but how could we possibly tell if the Pioneer Anomaly was an actual counterexample to GR which would require massive expansion, rather than a nitpicky mystery which merits a small explanation in the context of the existing theory?

It seems to me that there is no way to tell, and the only way to find out is by repeatedly trying new, non ad-hoc explanations, some of which may be groundbreaking theories (presumably only attempted after repeated failure of small explanations that don't disrupt the theoretical framework). Is that correct?

I can boil it down to one sentence, for simplicity's sake. When trying to solve a mystery that doesn't jive with our current understanding of the universe, at what point do scientists say ""we have to create a new theory"" instead of ""we have to interpret this anomaly in the framework of our existing theories?""",,False,,t5_2r7mh,False,,,True,t3_jp6dx,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/jp6dx/what_is_the_difference_between_a_genuine/,

This came about when Watson got onto Jeopardy. Everyone was amazed at this AI that could understand language and know things. As I understand it, although Watson is impressive, what's really happening is that a machine is following an incredible algorithm design. There is no sentient being that ""knows"" anything or that ""understands"" language. Just an algorithm that can work with some common language and initiate a query(google on steroids).

I think computers are easy to romanticize because they are abstract. Our algorithms are no longer programmed in tangible, mechanical systems. If it were, we might say ""oh, that's a neat trick."" Instead, our algorithms run on intangible(somewhat) electrical systems. They're a little more mysterious and magical that way.

What I see in Watson seems analogous to all AI. Computers process algorithms. We like to project meaning. We say the computer is thinking, understanding, etc. But are we unjustified? Since algorithms can be processed mechanically, I think it's highly justifiable to make an analogy: When a clock's hand reaches the next number, is the clock really counting? Of course not. It's a really neat trick people figured out that mechanically records time.

Copernicus clearly relied on much of the work of Islamic astronomers in formulating his new model of the solar system. The Islamic astronomers' distrust of the Ptolemaic model based on their observations, was perhaps the birth of modern scientific skepticism.

I also can't help but think Islamic contributions to science were deliberately written out of Western textbooks. 

By the way, throughout this last 12 months, we have had several popular posts and discussions about the contribution of Islamic scholars to modern science and thought. Were lucky enough to have some informed Islamic scholars participate as well. Here is a brief collection :

Usually when deciding to learn something new about (especially analytic) philosophy, I go for whatever appears to be closest to my own thoughts on the subject, and read that by way of introduction, and then pick up some of the books/papers that piece cites as being wrong -- my thoughts being that it is an easy way to hold my attention while I learn all the terms, arguments, and methods of discourse within the subtopic, and that the papers that the author spends the most time attacking are probably those worth spending time attacking, and thus will challenge my own thoughts on the matter.

With this and cost in mind, I bought Ronald N. Giere's [_Scientific Perspectivism_](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&amp;bookkey=4094708), and read the first few pages. So far it's good, the author seems well-read in fields outside of philosophy of science and has refrained from slandering anyone so far, rather building upon the works of even those he disagrees with. I'll be finishing _Infinite Jest_ before I begin on it in earnest, but that should happen within the next day or two.

I'm curious, though, of what those who have studied philosophy of science would recommend as general good introductions to the topic, as well as what they think of Giere or his book. Most of the philosophy that I've read has been of mind or language, so fairly analytic stuff and I have no problem reading and understanding works of analytic philosophy. In general I'm more interested in epistemology and ontology than methodology when it comes to phil. of sci. (that is, the more abstract stuff).

Thanks.

edit: I should probably say that while I have read much more analytic philosophy, I am by no means one who thinks analytic philosophy should be done to the exclusion of other methodologies, and so continental philosophy/phenomenology, or even literature, is welcome in recommendation.",,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,,True,t3_ep3nc,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/ep3nc/what_would_people_recommend_as_introductory_texts/,

Here is precisely *how it works* and that's all you need. Quit arguing about what it is"".

In the late 1700s, scientists were debating the nature of heat. The most popular theory at the time was the [caloric theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric_theory) of heat in which heat was a kind of fluid or weightless gas that flowed from hot objects to colder objects. The theory was introduced by [Antoine Lavoisier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier), one of the heros of Kuhn's, [""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions) and discoverer of oxygen. 

The theory was pretty much falsified by an [experiment involving a cannon and a horse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Experimental_Enquiry_Concerning_the_Source_of_the_Heat_which_is_Excited_by_Friction) in which a cannon barrel was immersed in water while a horse circled the setup which caused the cannon barrel to be bored. The water boiled after a few hours and continued to boil indefinitely. The experiment cast doubt on the theory that heat was a substance, because the supply of it appeared inexhaustible. The experiment's designers, Benjamin Thompson, and Count Rumford argued that heat was in fact, motion. Caloric theorists, unconstrained by a mathematical representation of their theory kind of absorbed the result into their own theory.

Along comes [Joseph Fourier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier), a French mathematician who wrote the paper ""Théorie analytique de la chaleur"" (Eng : An analytical theory of heat) which defined a whole new mathematical method to explain the properties of heat flow without even attempting to explain what heat *is*. You can read the paper in it's entirety [here](http://www.archive.org/details/analyticaltheory00fourrich). Essentially he modelled heat flow as a set of linear partial differential equations. To [calculate the conduction of heat through a body](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation#Solving_the_heat_equation_using_Fourier_series), supply the temperatures of the boundaries of the body and solve his heat diffusion equation by expressing it as a sum of simpler trigonometric components (known to any engineer as a [Fourier series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series)). 

Fourier fought for 15 years to get his paper published - his methods having been rejected by a committee that included the mathematician [Joseph Lagrange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Louis_Lagrange), himself a committed caloric theorist until he died.  He never postulated what heat was, in the same way that Newton never postulated what gravity was but he did say ""Heat, like gravity, penetrates every substance of the universe, its rays occupy all parts of space. The object of our work is to set forth the mathematical laws which this element obeys. The theory of heat will hereafter form one of the most important branches of general physics.""

Fourier's work raises the question posed by the [instrumentalist](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-progress/#3) - why do we even care whether a theory depicts an underlying reality or not provided it predicts correctly and leads to useful results? Who cares what gravity is? Who cares whether quarks are real or not? Who cares whether economic actors are *really* rational or not? Who cares how anti-depressants actually work? If the theory works, why worry?

Curious side note : Fourier's death was an example of the ironic ""theory killing the theorist"" (like Goedel's).

Description:

The Day the Universe Changed is a ten-part documentary television series presented by science historian James Burke. The series tells a series of stories of how specific scientific and technological advances have shaped the Western way of life. The series posits that when one's view of the universe changes, the universe itself effectively changes. The series' primary focus is on the effect of advances in science and technology on western philosophy. The title comes from the philosophical idea that the universe essentially only exists as you perceive it through what you know; therefore, if you change your perception of the universe with new knowledge, you have essentially changed the universe itself. To illustrate this concept, James Burke tells the various stories of important scientific discoveries and technological advances and how they fundamentally altered how western civilization perceives the world. The series runs in roughly chronological order, from around the beginning of the Middle Ages to the present.

Enjoy.",41,7,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/ac5om/the_most_lucid_discussion_of_the_background_proof/,"[*Originally posted at* **/r/PhilosophyofScience**](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience).

I was impressed when I came across this and wanted to share. In so far as you choose to trust my assessment of such matters, this is the most readable, best supported and comprehensive summary of Godel's theorems I have read (on the internet). A sparkling endorsement of internet learning in my humble view.

**The link [is here at a blog](http://rationalargumentator.com/issue195/godel.html) called the Rational Argumentator.**  The author appears to be a [mathematically trained independent scholar](http://www.quebecoislibre.org/apstolyarov.htm) now working as an actuary and philosophizing in his spare time.  

(For an even more readable, but less mathematically detailed read about Godel's contributions to logic and his personal life, [try here](http://plus.maths.org/issue39/features/dawson/).)

**TL;DR**  : A few memorable quotes from the article that might help put Godel in perspective for some people :

1. *The concepts of consistency and completeness are purely syntactical concepts, meaning that they are all about formal rules and formulas, and don't involve any notion of truth or falsity*


2. *Gödel's incompleteness theorems do not pertain to systems which are not framed in the language of mathematics – such as political, religious, esthetic, economic, biological, and literary systems and bodies of thought. Virtually every such system is incomplete in the formal mathematical sense*


3. *Theories to which Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem applies cannot be described via a finite body of axioms*


4. *Gödel’s proof of the existence of true but unprovable statements can be applied not only to Peano arithmetic itself but to any system which gives one the capacity to assign Gödel numbers to statements. Such a system must be “expressive enough to define the set of natural numbers or develop basic properties of the natural numbers,”*


5. *Gödel himself did not initially view his incompleteness theorems as defeating any of Hilbert’s program.... However, a few years of exchanges with John von Neumann (1903 – 1957), who held the view that “Peano Arithmetic already encompasses all that can be done finitistically,” eventually led Gödel to change his mind.*

6. *If von Neumann was right, then no finitistic proof of the consistency of the arithmetical axioms can be found – because the only such consistency proofs can be done outside the system of arithmetic itself. According to Feferman, most mathematicians today agree with von Neumann. Instead of pursuing a finitistic proof for the arithmetical axioms’ consistency, “much work has gone into extended (or relativized) forms of Hilbert’s program using constructive though non-finitistic means for consistency proofs.*


7. *Gödel’s second theorem showed that the consistency of a system cannot be proved within that system. It is a common mistake, however, to suppose that the system within which such consistency can be proved must be stronger than the original system.*


8. *In 1936, Gerhard Gentzen (1909-1945) proved the consistency of the arithmetical axioms from within a system that is not stronger than Peano arithmetic in all respects. Gentzen combined primitive recursive arithmetic, the “quantifier-free formalization of the natural numbers,”with quantifier-free transfinite induction, “an extension of mathematical induction to well-ordered sets,”up to the ordinal ε0.*  My note: Primitive recursive arithmetic is any many respects *weaker* than Peano arithmetic.


9. *Gödel’s last published paper in the journal Dialectica gave another proof of the consistency of the arithmetical axioms in 1958*


10. *Gödel’s theorems do not pertain to the issue of the existence of an objective reality*


11. *Gödel… saw his incompleteness theorems not as demonstrating the inadequacy of the axiomatic method but as showing that the derivation of theorems cannot be completely mechanized. He believed they justified the role of intuition in mathematical research.*


12. *By showing some fundamental limitations to how the consistency of mathematical systems can be proved, Gödel opened up an entirely new field of human endeavor [theoretical computer science] which has brought unprecedented benefits to billions of people.*",,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,,True,t3_ac5om,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/ac5om/the_most_lucid_discussion_of_the_background_proof/,

This effect has been put down to patients believing that they are taking active medication that will relieve their symptoms. [An article published in the Lancet](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B7EH8NEV9bzAOTcyMjYxNTktNzE1Yy00N2ZjLWIwMjYtNDlkYTkwZGI0Yjhh&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CN62l6cH) earlier this year discussed the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of the placebo effect. The authors discussed the role of expectation and conditioning (eg. from learned response, social observation and previous experience) that lead to placebo effects. The effects are shown to be real, for example, endogenous opioid release that leads to pain relief.

The use of placebos has raised ethical questions about the use of deception in placebo therapy. Prescribing a placebo intervention introduces issues of patient trust in the clinician and violates informed consent. Despite the known clinical effectiveness of placebo therapy, being less than forthright with a patient has long term implications for his or her healthcare.

A [small study published this week]( http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015591) has opened the door to the potential widespread use of placebo therapy without such ethical concern. In the study, patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were randomly assigned to receive either no medication or an inert sugar pill. Patients were openly told the placebo had no active effect, and the placebo bottle was labelled as such. Regardless, patients taking the placebo had greater reduction in symptoms than has been seen in trials where IBS patients are treated with active medications.

The study highlights the power of the psychological influence on disease. It demonstrates that the psychology of disease and its treatment goes beyond the power of belief, as it seems that the psychological impact of doing *something* is better than nothing, even when we *know* the something has no active effect in itself. If this effect is confirmed in larger studies, the impact on healthcare could be large – medications, alternative therapies and over-the-counter preparations that have been shown to have no effect above a placebo but are often still prescribed precisely “for the placebo effect” could become obsolete, and replaced with inert sugar/water pills (homeopathic preparations?) without ethical concerns or even without significant contact with formal mainstream or alternative healthcare.",,False,,t5_2r7mh,False,,,True,t3_eqct5,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/eqct5/placebos_without_deception/,

So please, voice your philosophical displeasure/ridicule/disgust below if you need to but don't deny others the opportunity to check their beliefs by downvoting this post into oblivion.*

The standard argument against teaching creationism in classrooms as an alternative scientific theory is that while it may or may not be ""true"", it is not ""scientific"" in the sense that it cannot be tested experimentally. Hence if it is to be taught, it should be taught separately from that of science.
 
[Frank Tipler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_J._Tipler) was a student of famous theoretical physicist [John Wheeler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler). Tipler, a non-conventional theist, was upset by a 1982 US Supreme Court opinion in [McLean v Arkansas Board of Education](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html) which dismissed creation science as essentially unscientific. It prompted him to write a paper in 1984 for the [Philosophy of Science Association](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html) which challenged the notion that [young earth creationism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism) was unfalsifiable and therefore not scientific. It was titled **[How to Construct a Falsifiable Theory in Which the Universe Came into Being Several
Thousand Years Ago](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B9y5Ze4Mo8qlYjYzMDI2MTEtYjA3Mi00ZDk1LWIwZmMtNDNlNjk0OGI3Y2E5&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CJq8iLsB)** and detailed a theoretical cosmology permitted by the principles of General Relativity and which accorded with all known empirical data at the time. It posited a series of co-ordinated black hole explosions intersecting the [world line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line) of the Earth which created barriers to [retrodiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrodiction) around several thousand years ago.  The paper is laden with physics and mathematics and if you can't be bothered reading it, [here](http://i.imgur.com/sYZgu.jpg) is a snapshot of his cosmology detailed on page 883.

Tipler, an accomplished physicist (who knows much more physics than I do and probably than many of us here do ) acknowledged the theory was highly unlikely and described it himself as ""wacky"" but he made what I think is an important and probably valid philosophical point which he details on page 1 as follows: 

&gt; It is universally thought that  it  is  impossible  to  construct  a  falsifiable  theory  which is  consistent  with  the  thousands  of  observations  indicating an  age  of  billions  of  years,  but  which  holds  that  the  Universe is  only  a  few  thousand  years  old. 

&gt; I  consider  such  a  view  a  slur  on  the  ingenuity  of  theoretical physicists:  we  can  construct  a  falsifiable  theory  with  any  characteristics  you  care  to  name.  To  prove  my point,  I  shall  construct in  this  paper  a  falsifiable  theory  in  which  the  entire  universe came  into  existence  a  mere  several  thousand  years  ago,  and  yet is  completely  consistent  with  the  enormously  large  number  of observations  indicating  a  much  larger  age. 


Are we as philosophers of science, and scientists, too quick to dismiss creation science as unscientific? Is there a more robust criterion for separating science from religion in the classroom? Perhaps science should be taught as ""naturalism"" and religion as ""extra-naturalism""?

Here are a few more I have come up with.


**Education**

* Here is a [pie chart](http://i.imgur.com/tkKVm.jpg) of the highest educational level completed across respondents.

* 5 respondents stated they were college professors. This constitutes about 2% of all respondents. 

* 6.1% of respondents state they already have a PhD,  10.2% of respondents state they are presently doing a PhD, 4.5% of respondents plan to do a PhD in the future. That's a whopping 21% of readers with PhD potential. (I don't mean to appear elitist here -some of the most interesting comments came from college dropouts for example).



**Current Activities**

* Here is a [pie chart](http://i.imgur.com/xv1Y8.jpg) of current activity of readers

* Most common professional areas were software/IT (by a long, long way), then music/art (yep!), academe, teaching, science, retail.

* most popular areas of current undergrad study are philosophy, computing/IT, biology, physics in that order

* most popular areas of current PhD study are psychology, neuroscience, economics and physics.


**Atheist/Theist**

* There was a definite trend across age groups of respondents that the amount of people who did not offer an opinion on the subject increased across age. 20 and under : 4%, 21-25 : 14%,  26-30: 15%, 31-40: 26%, Over 40: 37%

* Percentages of stated atheists dropped across age. 72% of 20 and under down to 53% of over 40s.

Thanks all around and some philosophy subreddit shoutouts.,35,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/am2cz/philosophyofscience_subreddit_reaches_1000_users/,"From sixbillionthsheep,

A little over 3 months ago, drunkentune and I started this subreddit. I was hopeful drunkentune would take the bait, after some crazy internet-style exchanges between us about the subject. drunkentune showed a great amount of courage and foresight to accept my invitation and contribute like a champion to make the subreddit work. So thanks to drunkentune (male or female - I still don't really know).

Both of us want to also thank all of our 1000+ subscribers who have got us to this point. Your feedback really helps us to refine our thoughts (and sometimes abandon them altogether!)

If this subreddit has sparked an interest in the philosophical aspects of knowledge and life, drunkentune and I both highly recommend [/r/PoliticalPhilosophy](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalPhilosophy/) and [/r/AcademicPhilosophy](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy).

We welcome your contributions - whether you have philosophy training or not (I don't for example). All posts are of course subject to the preferences of the users but if you have something interesting or thoughtful to offer, our users are generally very generous with their support (even when they disagree with you ;)). So feel welcome to submit something related to the philosophy of science that grabs your interest. If you have some suggestions, or would like to see something posted on the subreddit, feel free to pipe up and let us know.

From drunkentune, 

Hi, this is drunkentune speaking. How's everything going? While sixbillionthsheep has said nearly everything I wished to say after reaching 1,000 subscribers (and, might I add, in a far clearer style than I), I do wish to add/extend two small points:

(1) I am willing and able to track down all sorts of papers on the philosophy of science. Send me a message and I will do my best to find a .pdf copy.

(2) I too want to stress the point that this subreddit can only thrive with an open, critical, and diverse community. A closed, uncritical and uniform community is stagnant; progress comes only through conflict.

We will hear ideas that we may see as prima facie false. In these cases, we must always remember the motto of Karl Popper: ""I may be wrong and you may be right, and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth.""
We have the ethical imperative to be critical of ideas we think are wrong, not the individual, and we must always do our best to understand the ideas we seek to criticize.",,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,,True,t3_am2cz,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/am2cz/philosophyofscience_subreddit_reaches_1000_users/,

1358117377.0,33,self.PhilosophyofScience,16ijox,Some Thoughts on Popper and the Duhem-Quine Thesis,40,7,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/16ijox/some_thoughts_on_popper_and_the_duhemquine_thesis/,"The Duhem-Quine thesis is that it's impossible to test a scientific hypothesis in isolation, because any empirical test requires implicit auxiliary hypotheses. Such auxiliary hypotheses may include assumptions about initial conditions, other scientific hypotheses concerning the function of experimental apparatus, or even metaphysical presuppositions on the nature of observation.

The Duhem-Quine thesis is often referred to as the Duhem-Quine *problem*, because it appears to undermine the authority of science to reveal general facts about the universe. That is, it implies that we can never pin the blame for a failed prediction on any particular hypothesis--all we know, so to speak, is that something is rotten in the state of Denmark. In particular, the Duhem-Quine thesis is often held up as a refutation of Karl Popper's criterion of falsifiability, and it's this claim I wish to address here.

Normally, the logic of falsification is presented as a case of *modus tollens*, but it's perhaps more helpful to consider it in as the retransmission of falsity in a valid argument. That is, just as truth is transmitted from premises to conclusion in a valid argument, so falsity is retransmitted from conclusion to premises, i.e. if the conclusion is false, then at least one of the premises must be false.

Where 'H' is a scientific hypothesis and 'E' is some evidence, we might say that 'not-E' falsifies the hypothesis if, and only if,

    H ⊨ E

However, this is a naive understanding of falsification. As the Duhem-Quine thesis reminds us, such a deduction implicitly depends on many auxiliary hypotheses, e.g. initial conditions. We'll label these auxiliary hypotheses 'A^1' to 'A^n'.

    H &amp; (A^1 &amp; ... A^n) ⊨ E

Now we have a rather explicit representation of the Duhem-Quine problem: 'not-E' no longer entails 'not-H'. In this case, 'not-E' falsifies the entire conjunction of 'H' and 'A^1' through 'A^n '--at least one member of that conjunction must be false. However, there is no logical procedure to determine which premise(s) is responsible for the falsification, and there are multiple logically permissible moves to restore consistency. Perhaps 'H' is just false, or maybe 'H' is true and 'A^7' is the problem; maybe they're all false.

However, I want to suggest this formulation of the logic of falsification is inappropriate, especially given Popper's own views on the nature of observation. In particular, Popper stressed that all observation is theory-laden. He argued that even a simple statement like 'there is a cup of water here on the table' is theoretically-loaded. Things like tables, water, and cups are defined by their general behaviour; even the idea of something being *here* involves rather complex assumptions about space and time. For Popper, then, there was nothing infallible or epistemologically foundational about observation; rather, reports of observation are highly conjectural attempts to capture discrete facts.

My claim, then, is that from a Popperian perspective, rather than lumping the auxiliary hypotheses with our premises, we should instead place them in the conclusion, because it's the auxiliary hypotheses that actually impregnate our observations with the theory necessary to make them possible at all. To preserve the validity of the argument, then, we append the auxiliary hypotheses to 'E' as the antecedent of a material implication.

    H ⊨ (A^1 &amp; ... A^n) → E

In this case, a falsifying observation is characterised as the negation of a material implication. 'Not-E' alone is not something which can be observed, because an observation-report is a complex theoretical entity that incorporates the auxiliary hypotheses. The observation, for example, 'there is a cup of water here on the table', can be false in many different ways, but each way that it might be false changes the meaning of the observation in some way.

For example, suppose 'not-E' is true. This does not necessarily falsify 'H', because the argument remains valid if we assume that 'A^1 &amp; ... A^n' is false. This is another manifestation of the Duhem-Quine thesis. However, in this new formulation of the argument, assuming the auxiliary hypotheses are false is tantamount to claiming the observation itself is false, because it's the auxiliary hypotheses that are doing the theoretical-ladening--they are what make the observation possible in the first place.

So constructed, the target of a falsifying observation is no longer ambiguous. If the conclusion is false then 'H' must also be false. To evade falsification, one instead has to deny that the observation is true. This is, of course, a logically permissible move, but it isolates disagreement in the theoretical interpretation of an observation.",,False,,t5_2r7mh,1358143389.0,,,True,t3_16ijox,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/16ijox/some_thoughts_on_popper_and_the_duhemquine_thesis/,

**0. Why the fuck?**

It's important. That's why. Note: I know just as much as you about the classic tragedies, but after posting some old notes, I decided to re-read a dime-store copy of a collection of Euripides. My thoughts on the revelation scene are as follows.

**I.**

In Euripides' *Electra*, Electra receives evidence of the secret arrival of Orestes, offering three signs that correspond to the three signs offered to Electra in the earlier *Libation Bearers*. The old man rejects the possibility that the hair could be anyone’s but Orestes’s (520 - 23), but Euripides’s Electra is unwilling to make such a leap of faith, methodically rejecting the *very same arguments* given by Aeschylus’s Electra when placed in the old man's mouth. She rejects the possibility of her brother would return in secret, for she assumes that he would return openly (524-26) and then she goes on (527-29) to note the inherent differences between the lock of hair from a woman and a man and the irrelevance of foot-size in determining relatives. To finish the syllogism, she notes that many people who are unrelated also have similar hair. *This is the new faith in the capabilities of reason.*

**II.**

Euripides paints a world full of confusion and error, for the objects-in-themselves tell Electra nothing about things she does not know. Euripides’s Electra embraces faith, too, but it is a faith in the nobility of Orestus, the nobility of humankind. This is the faith of modern science, where reason is taken to have triumphed over superstition, and yet it claims far more epistemic warrant than it deserves. It *is* a type of faith. All the evidence is rejected (and rightly so!) as demonstrating nothing, and yet Orestes is present, and has been speaking with his sister for some time. 

Electra is wrong *just as she is making the most reasonable assessment of the evidence at hand*. And yet her earlier incarnation makes the correct inferences for all the wrong reasons (credulity). Euripides mocks the very *pretensions* of human reasoning, to know more than one knows, revealing that Electra, too, has a deep faith in rationality, and by extension, that evidence and truth are often worlds apart: Electra is right in her reasoning, *and yet she is wrong*.

No one is a hero; no one is noble; there is no happy ending; everyone, even the shrewdest and most rational, is ignorant of the certain-truth.

I have been in discussion recently with a person who holds the somewhat Platonic notion that mathematics inhabits its own plane of reality. In other words, he holds that the physical world is merely a ""clue"" as to the self-contained world that is mathematics, and that mathematics does not require the physical world's existence in order to be true.

I am 99% certain that Godel's Theorem proves this untrue--the body of mathematical truth is not axiomatic, and neither is physics--and so I posited with confidence that the universe pre-exists mathematical truth, even though mathematical truth exists independently of the opinion of human beings. In other words, math depends on the universe for its truth, and is inextricably tied to it. It is not the free-floating, self-contained plane of reality that Plato thought it was.

Was I right in making this assertion? Is this an abuse of Godel?",,False,,t5_2r7mh,False,,,True,t3_dq70p,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/dq70p/another_question_about_godels_theorem/,

Thanks all 'round. ,36,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/d8xxa/philosophyofscience_reddit_reaches_5000_users_in/,"Well it's that time again where we take stock of where we are and how far we've come. Kind of hard for us to believe but we recently surpassed 5000 readers. That puts us in the top 1.5% of all reddits by subscriptions. The [first 1000 of you](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/am2cz/philosophyofscience_subreddit_reaches_1000_users/) were the toughest to attract but [since then](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/bbs8k/introduction_to_the_philosophy_of_science_for_new/) our growth has seemed to accelerate. Seems there are a whole lot of like-minded thinkers out there interested in questioning their beliefs about science and mathematics. We'd like to thank you all for coming along for the ride and keeping the standards of discussions high and valuable. Now in case you hadn't heard, this reddit evolved from an argument between drunkentune and myself (an ongoing thread of which pervades our discussions!). I doubt either of us had great expectations for the channel - we were just following our love of, and perhaps sometimes competing for, knowledge of an observable flavour!

What we do want to continue to encourage here is your posting of links. We haven't reached a point yet where we are getting sufficient numbers of links to be a self-sustaining community. There are so many great links posted in the comments - why not consider posting them directly to the channel and letting others share in your find? Chances are, if you find it interesting, and it is getting upvotes, it will do well on the main page as well. Don't be afraid that others will have already read the link or think it primitive - there are many many others who probably haven't but would like to. First and foremost we are a channel of learners and sharers with a smattering of experts in a variety of fields. 

What would make a good post? Anything that makes us think about science itself and questions our beliefs about matters of scientific significance. Post popularity also is not the final measure of goodness - there may be a small niche group of subscribers who would be excited to read your topic.

So what's next? Well drunkentune and I are intending to run [another contest ](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/acgvi/phil_of_sci_subreddit_the_free_book_contest_dec_8/)- the details of which should be available soon in another post. In the meantime your ideas for this contest are very welcome. 

Shortly we will also announce a survey of you all. We're sure it will be quite fascinating for all of us to find out who we all are. In case you haven't noticed, in amongst the many students (like us) here, we have practicing physicists, biologists, philosophers, historians, engineers, mathematicians contributing their insights to this forum. Make a note of them when you find them - they can add some real gems of insight to your understanding. 

Finally, there are plenty of other reddits out there that might interest you and need your support to get going. For a brief list of them that we enjoy, be sure to check out [our front page link](http://bit.ly/d36W3J) to them.

America has always been (relatively) very adamant about doing everything the right way. Everything requires proper procedure, permits, registration, licenses, etc. But it seems that corruption has become clearly rampant not only in the political spectrum but that it's clearly spilled over into science and research.

I'm sorry everybody but I am feeling very depressed and at a loss right now. My main concern in general is human health. A corporations best interests are to make money and massive corporations have more lobbying and financial power than any group of doctors or researchers ever will. And if the truth is squelched or modified or hidden by those in power, then what is to become of science? (Why would I trust a single thing the FDA/USDA has to say if former head-honchos from Monsanto are running the show?)

Even universities seem to have evolved into corporations, where money and profits and future funding are the primary concerns rather than actual pursuit of knowledge.

**tl;dr: Corruption seems to eventually permeate all human endeavors such as government, politics, and law enforcement but I think the worst case is when it happens in the realm of science. How will the truth prevail with everything revolving around money?**

But suppose the Earth were, like Venus, enclosed perpetually in thick clouds. The very existence of an external universe would be unknown for a long time, and to develop the laws of mechanics we would be dependent on the observations we can make locally. Since tossing of small objects is nearly the first activity of every child, it would be observed very early that they do not always fall with the same side up, and that all one's efforts to control the outcome are in vain. The natural hypothesis would be that it is the volition of the object tossed, not the volition of the tosser, that determines the outcome; indeed, that is the hypothesis that small children make when questioned about this. Then it would be a major discovery, once coins had been fabricated, that they tend to show both sides about equally often; and the equality appears to get better as the number of tosses increases.  The equality of heads and tails would be seen as a fundamental law of physics; symmetric objects have a symmetric volition in falling.  With this beginning, we could develop the mathematical theory of object tossing, discovering the binomial distribution, the absence of time correlations, the limit theorems, the combinatorial frequency laws for tossing of several coins at once, the extension to more complicated symmetric objects like dice, etc. All the experimental confirmations of the theory would consist of more and more tossing experiments, measuring the frequencies in more and more elaborate scenarios. From such experiments, nothing would ever be found that called into question the existence of that volition of the object tossed; they only enable one to confirm that volition and measure it more and more accurately.  Then suppose that someone was so foolish as to suggest that the motion of a tossed object is determined, not by its own volition, but by laws like those of Newtonian mechanics, governed by its initial position and velocity. He would be met with scorn and derision; for in all the existing experiments there is not the slightest evidence for any such influence. The Establishment would proclaim that, since all the observable facts are accounted for by the volition theory, it is philosophically naive and a sign of professional incompetence to assume or search for anything deeper.  In this respect, the elementary physics textbooks would read just like our present quantum theory textbooks...""

Some background to the incident [here](http://dorigo.wordpress.com/2008/01/14/storm-over-rome-physicists-against-pope-ratzinger/). The title of the piece is misleading - Ratzinger did not defend Galileo - instead saying ""It would be foolish to construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views."" Here is [more on the modern Catholic views](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair#Modern_Catholic_Church_views) about the Galileo affair.

However, for the record, I agree with both Feyerabend and Ratzinger, that the Church acted both more rationally and in a more scientifically disciplined manner than Galileo did in the historical context, contrary to popular scientistic mythology. I would go even further to say that the Pope at the time of Galileo (a former close friend of his before he became Pope) most likely even accepted Galileo's heliocentrism but circumstance ([ongoing war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years'_War)), the availability of an empirically adequate alternative ([Tycho's Brahe's model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonic_system)) and Galileo's obnoxiousness (depicting him as a [simpleton in the Dialogue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_Concerning_the_Two_Chief_World_Systems), defying Church order to keep an open mind) prevented him from tolerating the view publicly.

Finally, I would say that Galileo's heliocentric views were what many of us would deem ""pseudo-scientific"". His [theory of tides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei#Galileo.2C_Kepler_and_theories_of_tides) which was designed to address the ""if the earth is travelling around the sun, why don't we experience the effects of the movement? "" argument was indefensible (and wrong), and flew in the face of available observational evidence that the tides coincided with phases of the moon. He described the lunar theory of tides as ""useless fiction"".

Fire away! ;) (but, please if you don't like this reasoning, I would appreciate it if you would take the time to explain why...)

It was aimed at making accessible to a wider scientific audience, the recent discovery of two statements that appeared quite ""natural"" and ""tame"" mathematically but were shown to be undecidable in Peano arithmetic leading mathematicians to believe that Goedel incompleteness wasn't only a problem of highly contrived logic problems.

One of the statements was the [Paris-Harrington Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris%E2%80%93Harrington_theorem). The theorem is described as a ""finite"" version of [Ramsey's Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey's_theorem#Infinite_Ramsey_theorem) which posits infinite sets.  The other was Harvey Friedman's finite variation of [Kruskal's tree theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal's_tree_theorem).

To give you some flavour about what kind of mathematical problems these theorems address, here is a description of the party problem. The party problem is a special case of [Ramsey's theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey's_theorem#Infinite_Ramsey_theorem), of which the Paris-Harrington theorem is a slight variant.

&gt; How many guests must you have at your
party to be assured that a certain number
of them either all know each other or all
are strangers to each other? If you want
to be sure that at least three guests are
mutual acquaintances or mutual strangers, you must have at least six people at
your party. If you want four guests all to
know each other or all to be strangers
you need at least 18 people at the party.
But no one knows the minimum number
of guests you need at the party to guarantee a similar group of five. The number is
somewhere between 42 and 55. Says
Graham, ""It is hopeless to try and compute the exact number. It is way beyond
our present computing power.""

*(Note : As of 2010, the [problem has still not been solved (R(5,5))](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RamseyNumber.html) but the solution is somewhere between 42 and 50.)*

I think it is important to note that while these theorems cannot be proved in Peano arithmetic (first order), they can be proved in [second-order arithmetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_arithmetic) which permits the construction of sets of natural numbers. To me, these results simply reinforce the view that Goedel's theorem is not some deep limitation on our ability to grasp mathematical ""truths"". It is an inescapable limitation on efforts to capture all that is important in mathematics with simple self-evident truths (or as Descartes would have put it, [""clear and distinct ideas""](http://www.philosophyonline.co.uk/tok/rationalism7.htm)) that are most familiar to us. I think this growing schism of our understanding of truth via concepts which are intuitively familiar to us as humans [is also nothing new to modern physicists](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMFPe-DwULM#t=5m55s).

As discussed in a [recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/egia2/goedel_incompleteness_results_gets_real_our/), even more ""natural"" theorems have been recently proved.

On the one hand, I think it says something positive about the [context of discovery](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/dhfwl/a_very_brief_overview_of_the_scientific_method/). Imagination is the positive aspect of Keeping an Open Mind: new discoveries often are birthed in madness. Yet, I think it is a despicable idea when we apply it to the context of justification. Once we Keep an Open Mind, we'll soon see that Chi, dowsing, homeopathy, creationism, astrology, ghosts, *The Secret*, or miracles -- name your poison -- are manifestly true. These pseudoscientifc ideas refuse to enter the context of justification, yet hitch a ride inside your mind when you 'Keep an Open Mind'.

I think Keeping an Open Mind is pernicious at best:

(1) If we were to *attempt* to remove our biases, we would never be able to know that we have been successful, and the conversation would then be sidetracked with discussions directed at the man, rather than at the *idea*.

(2) Humans always view new ideas in relation to their background knowledge. No one can remove all of their 'biases' without wiping the mind. We wouldn't follow the habit to stay clear of three-card Monty or dark alleys late at night. We would have to abandon the preference for truth over falsity. These are also 'biases', you know.

(3) Credulity would replace criticism.

Credulous individuals, by Keeping an Open Mind, open the gates to new ideas, and once they are within the castle, they never *confront* these new ideas to see if they're carrying contraband. I think this is the insidious problem of Keeping an Open Mind: it's best when dealing with the imaginative creation of possible situations (there might be a bear in the back of the cave!), but it would be mistaken to *act* on these imaginative creations without critically evaluating them on their merits (if there might be a bear in the back of the cave, there *must* be a bear in the back of the cave!). 

In short, I think it best to Keep an Open Mind when coming up with something new. However, please Keep a *Critical* Mind when encountering a new idea: does A stand up to criticism B? Does B stand up to criticism C? And so on.

**tl;dr**: The expression to 'keep an open mind' is used today to preemptively counter possible criticisms of an idea.

-----

Addendum: To extend my analogy further, someone with the 'ideal closed mind' would not allow any new ideas into the castle, even after they have been vetted. The logical reconstruction of their thought, I think, would be as follows: *is A justified by B, where B are our vetting procedures?* B is ever-fluid depending on the context of admissions. It's never addressed, even though it doesn't let anything new inside the walls.",,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,,True,t3_djj69,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/djj69/dont_keep_an_open_mind_some_ideas_after_coffee/,

1263030703.0,33,self.PhilosophyofScience,anhhe,The Traveller's Dilemma : a dilemma for the foundations of game theory?,41,8,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/anhhe/the_travellers_dilemma_a_dilemma_for_the/,"*Originally posted in [/r/PhilosophyofScience](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/)*.

[Game theory](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/) has had some [limited success as a descriptive theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory#Application_and_challenges) in economics, biology, computer science and even philosophy. One of the cornerstones of game theory analysis is the [Nash equilibrium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium), a state of the game where no player can improve his/her outcome by changing his/her strategy without causing an opportunity for a better outcome for other players by changing strategy. (Yes Nash was that guy that the movie [A Beautiful Mind](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/) was based on).

Games may have multiple Nash equilibria and it is generally agreed by theorists that the best outcome for all players, if one exists, must be a Nash equilibrium. Nash himself believed that even though in practice, equilibria of games might not be achieved, they will always tend toward an equilibrium point as games are repeated.  Conditions for this to occur include the requirement that all players are ""rational"" and that all players have perfect information about payoffs and possible moves. 

**This assumption/definition of rationality is where the trouble for game theory begins.**

One of the problems with these assumptions lies in human psychology. Consider what is known as the [ultimatum game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game) between two players. A fixed amount of money is to be shared among two players. One player is selected to make an offer about how much he will keep and how much he will give to the other player. The other player then has the option to accept or reject the offer. If he rejects the offer, both players get nothing. If he accepts the offer, the players get the agreed amount. In a one-off application of the game, it is ""Nash-optimal"" for the second player to accept any non-zero amount the other player offers. However this is [not what happens in practice](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=286428). The average offer is 40% of the total and 16% of all offers are rejected. 

**But disagreement with experiment is only the start of the problems for the Nash equilibrium concept**. 

Consider the game called the **[traveller's dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveler's_dilemma)**. A referee asks two players to write down any dollar integer between 2 and 100 without conferring with each other. If both write the same number the referee will pay each of them that amount. But if they write different numbers, he will pay both of them the lower number along with a bonus and a penalty. The person who wrote the lower number will get $2 more and the one who wrote the higher number will get $2 less. For instance, if Player 1 writes 46 and Player 2 writes 89, Player 1 will get $48 and Player 2 will get $44. (For a more extensive and informal discussion of the game and its consequences see [this blog post](http://blog.adamnash.com/2007/11/13/the-travelers-dilemma-irrational-choices-altriuism-or-implicit-collusion/). To try a simulation of the game yourself [go here](http://veconlab.econ.virginia.edu/tddemo.htm)).

There is one unique Nash equilibrium for this game - both players write down $2. Yet this seems to defy all common sense. They could have both offered much larger numbers and both have been much better off. In fact this is **[what happens in live experiments](http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B5in3UhbNXiJNmM5MTg1NWEtMjc2Ny00NDRjLTk2NDAtNjNmYmIyODg3MWZk&amp;hl=en)**. According to the theorists, this implies that humans are simply *not rational*. (For a detailed description of the problem and proposed resolutions, see **[this seminal paper on the problem](http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B5in3UhbNXiJNjVkMWUyZjQtOWE4Ni00MmRiLTlmN2YtMmRhOGU2YzFhNDEz&amp;hl=en)**). 

[Douglas Hofstadter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter) (author of *[Godel, Escher, Bach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach)*) proposed a new definition of rationality he called [superrationality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality) whereby each player knows not only that his behavior is rational, but that the behavior of all players is rational, and all players know that all players are rational, and all players know that all players know that all players are rational, and so on. Hofstadter reasons based on this assumption, that superrational players would for example, agree to collude and keep silent in the [Prisoner's Dilemma](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/) game (in which the unique Nash equilibrium suggests that both players should confess). 

In my mind, if game theory analysis can yield results so plainly counter-intutive as that of the traveller's dilemma, what confidence can be had in equilibria analysis of more complicated games? Is the game theory definition of *rational* - naively and selfishly trying to best an opponent to improve one's own localised outcome - in any sense valid?

1371580306.0,30,self.PhilosophyofScience,1glmfp,Scott Aaronson's recent paper on free will has a sorta-formalized model of the interplay between philosophy and science,41,11,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/1glmfp/scott_aaronsons_recent_paper_on_free_will_has_a/,"Here's one of the most relevant parts, quoted from [the original](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0159) by lukeprog on LW:

Whenever it’s been possible to make definite progress on ancient philosophical problems, such progress has almost always involved a [kind of] “bait-and-switch.” In other words: one replaces an unanswerable philosophical riddle Q by a “merely” scientific or mathematical question Q′, which captures part of what people have wanted to know when they’ve asked Q. Then, with luck, one solves Q′.

Of course, even if Q′ is solved, centuries later philosophers might still be debating the exact relation between Q and Q′! And further exploration might lead to other scientific or mathematical questions — Q′′, Q′′′, and so on — which capture aspects of Q that Q′ left untouched. But from my perspective, this process of “breaking oﬀ” answerable parts of unanswerable riddles, then trying to answer those parts, is the closest thing to philosophical progress that there is.

Successful examples of this breaking-oﬀ process fill intellectual history. The use of calculus to treat infinite series, the link between mental activity and nerve impulses, natural selection, set theory and first-order logic, special relativity, Gödel’s theorem, game theory, information theory, computability and complexity theory, the Bell inequality, the theory of common knowledge, Bayesian causal networks — each of these advances addressed questions that could rightly have been called “philosophical” before the advance was made. And after each advance, there was still plenty for philosophers to debate about truth and provability and infinity, space and time and causality, probability and information and life and mind. But crucially, it seems to me that the technical advances transformed the philosophical discussion as philosophical discussion itself rarely transforms it! And therefore, if such advances don’t count as “philosophical progress,” then it’s not clear that anything should.

Appropriately for this essay, perhaps the best precedent for my bait-and-switch is the Turing Test... with legendary abruptness, Turing simply replaced the original question by a different one: “Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?”...

 ...The claim is not that the new question, about the imitation game, is identical to the original question about machine intelligence. The claim, rather, is that the new question is a worthy candidate for what we should have asked or meant to have asked, if our goal was to learn something new rather than endlessly debating definitions. [Luke adds: I'm reminded of Dennett's quip that ""Philosophy... is what you have to do until you figure out what questions you should have been asking in the first place.""] In math and science, the process of revising one’s original question is often the core of a research project, with the actual answering of the revised question being the relatively easy part!

A good replacement question Q′ should satisfy two properties:

 (a) Q′ should capture some aspect of the original question Q — so that an answer to Q′ would be hard to ignore in any subsequent discussion of Q.

 (b) Q′ should be precise enough that one can see what it would mean to make progress on Q′: what experiments one would need to do, what theorems one would need to prove, etc.

The Turing Test, I think, captured people’s imaginations precisely because it succeeded so well at (a) and (b). Let me put it this way: if a digital computer were built that aced the imitation game, then it’s hard to see what more science could possibly say in support of machine intelligence being possible. Conversely, if digital computers were proved unable to win the imitation game, then it’s hard to see what more science could say in support of machine intelligence not being possible. Either way, though, we’re no longer “slashing air,” trying to pin down the true meanings of words like “machine” and “think”: we’ve hit the relatively-solid ground of a science and engineering problem. Now if we want to go further we need to dig (that is, do research in cognitive science, machine learning, etc). This digging might take centuries of backbreaking work; we have no idea if we’ll ever reach the bottom. But at least it’s something humans know how to do and have done before. Just as important, diggers (unlike air-slashers) tend to uncover countless treasures besides the ones they were looking for.",,False,,t5_2r7mh,False,,,True,t3_1glmfp,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/1glmfp/scott_aaronsons_recent_paper_on_free_will_has_a/,

By that I mean a sceptical position where any framework or conclusion we arrive at can be called into doubt. Any absolute knowledge is impossible for a human to obtain, so it COULD turn out that everything we think we know is entirely wrong. How do you continue in spite of this fact? Are the conclusions you reach still satisfying? Do you still feel like you're working towards real knowledge?

I'm not really sure what I'm trying to say.  For example, we feel good about understanding what causes wind, we feel like we know something about the world.  But it could be that we are completely wrong and that from a more informed point of view, knowing about things we are oblivious to, our explanation of wind is as simple as explaining the movement of the sun by way of a chariot in the sky.  Doesn't that make any knowledge we have empty, unsure and insufficient?

Another worry I have is if we only know the universe by way of human inventions (mathematical quantifications, rationalism, even something like colour vision) can we ever say that we are  getting to know the universe itself?

Edit:  Maybe it's more of an emotional problem that I'm having. I all of a sudden can't feel happy or confident in anything that we've come to ""know"". The possibility exists that we're completely wrong so how can we justify feeling good about it? I know one response is to say that we followed the best method available, a method that leads to probbly true conclusions (sorry if I'm putting words in your mouth here), but even then, how can we calculate the probability of being right if we have such a narrow bit of knowledge? Isnt it only probably true from out limited field of vision? It might be very probably not true given a wealth of knowledge we don't have access to. I know the fact that we arrived at our conclusion using the best method available should soothe us, but given the possibility that we're completely wrong, why bother or feel good about our conclusions?

1284065670.0,29,self.PhilosophyofScience,dbrrz,The connection between ethics and epistemology,36,7,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/dbrrz/the_connection_between_ethics_and_epistemology/,"**Edit**: I'm surprised in the synchronicity of this post and [this other post](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/dbrcb/the_science_of_morality/). I was out smoking a cigarette when I decided to start writing on the connection between ethics and epistemology and settled on an exposition of Popper and Jarvie's critical approach to ethics.

**I.**

Some people think that there are no grounds on which to judge different cultures. The cultural practice of ['honor' killing](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/the-crimewave-that-shames-the-world-2072201.html) is as equally justified as cultural practices that ensure freedom of speech, for instance. That's how the argument goes.

In a (qualified) sense, I agree. There are no foundations one can appeal to, no (so far as I can tell) justification for human rights or human dignity that extend beyond culture. What I'm getting at is that we ought to remain agnostic over the existence of any ethical code that is inherent to the universe.

**II.**

This same claim is directed towards different cultural theories of knowledge (Feyerabend, *et al*.): who am I to say that, since all theories of knowledge are cultural constructs, reading the entrails of goats is any better than the Western process of scientific discovery?

Again, I would have to agree (with some qualification): yes, there are no foundations to knowledge; all theories of knowledge are cultural constructs.

**III.**

A justificationist is then in a bind: she has no way to justify the preference of some cultures over overs. However, I think that even though cultures differ, some cultures are better (as far as I can tell) than others, both ethically and epistemically, without resorting to any sort of justification for this preference.

Instead of asserting that there exists externally to culture some kind of ephemeral justification for ethics or epistemology, I can say that some forms of behavior produce some results while other forms of behavior produce other results. This is noncontroversial.

**IV.**

Take the next step: Which kinds of results do I want? I make a choice to prefer freedom over slavery, or nonviolence over violence. I prefer an admittedly fallible cultural system that convicts violent criminals based on argument and evidence over a dogmatic culture that sees it proper to burn the face off of children that want to learn how to read.

I make the meta-theoretical *choice* to prefer what Popper calls 'Open' societies or cultures over 'Closed' societies or cultures. This applies equally to ethics *and* epistemology. I choose to prefer nonviolence; I choose to prefer science. *Why do I choose them?* Initially, my choice is made as follows: Both of these positions embrace the fallible attitude. *We don't know if we're right*.

**V.**

If I don't know if I'm right in my proposals for ethical action or conjectures, *perhaps* silencing someone that disagrees with me would be a mistake. Therefore, *if* I want to correct my mistaken ideas, it is not productive to squash all competing ideas. *If* I want to fix my mistakes, I want to hear productive criticism from all different sorts of viewpoints. Furthermore, if I stone a woman to death because her actions go against my ideas of what is right, my idea of what is right could could be in error. *If* I am mistaken, I do not want blood on my hands.

Thus, fallibilism provides two reasons (but not justifications) for choosing my behavior: (1) if I could be epistemically wrong, I could remain wrong if I refrain from listening to competing ideas; (2) if I could be ethically wrong, acting so as to harm another person I think deserves harm may in fact be an *unethical* action.

If someone thinks my choices to prefer nonviolence and science are wrong, they're more than welcome to argue against 'Open' societies and in favor of 'Closed' societies. They're also more than welcome to argue that my preferences will not produce the desired results. I may be wrong and they may be right, but they won't convince me with a gun.",,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,,True,t3_dbrrz,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/dbrrz/the_connection_between_ethics_and_epistemology/,

I joined this subreddit somewhere around a year and half ago, and some change. Back then there were less than 5,000 readers and users were rarely online. Posts moved slowly and the comment sections had maybe one or two dozen comments at the most. This subreddit was specific, methodical, arcane, and above all else knowledgeable about the specific study of the field the Philosophy of Science. To be fair it was also slow and at times boring or rather scholastic in its discourse. 

Now I enjoy the more lively debates and faster paced boards that have come along with the great influx of readers, but I am no longer sure how many people here know or read the, at times, rather arcane, but still amazing, technical philosophers of science. I would guess most have read about or some Karl Popper, hopefully a bit of Kuhn, and certainly know of Hume, but I would like to know how many people have bothered reading any of the logical positivists, such as Ayer, Hempel, Quine, Reichenbach, Grelling, or Tarski, or the causal philosophers, such as Lewis, Kvart, or Mackie. Additionally I'll throw in a few oddballs that some will know, but are still fun, like Feyerabend and Fraassen. However, my larger question is: does this community still focus on and take seriously the past and contemporary debates in the field of Scientific Philosophy? Or is the board more about the contemporary usage and debates surrounding the methodology and implementation of science, such as the reproducibility of studies, publication bias, and the mismanagement of things like big science or big Pharma. I find that these issues that are often posted about in here, while dealing with some philosophy of science, hardly due the field of study justice. All those debates I just mentioned essentially take an initial position about the nature of science and the scientific community for granted. Science already has a distinct and achievable purpose in most of these posts, and mandates a certain methodology that can be easily understood, deviated from, or corrected to the 'true' methodology. It seems that a good number of people on here are all too certain as to what counts as science, and what is that notion of science's aims and purpose. Is this change something that we should welcome? The least I can say is that we seem to have too few or any foundational debates, about which the subject is truly centered on, and so much more uninformed posturing than in days of old. 

I would like to have a consensual opinion on this matter. If those who comment could indicate whether or not they are glad of the direction this board has taken, while still criticizing most of my post, I would be quite content.

Detailed question inside.,31,2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/ev80c/wait_do_people_really_believe_that_the_concept_of/,"I was reading a paper recently posted to SSRN, written by a law professor. The source is [here](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1731665).

Is this really how people think about science these days?

&gt;Falsification sounds like a good bedrock principle for a science, but it was a failure. As Thagard points out, the falsification principle either ruled out most of science as unscientific or ruled out nothing.^58

&gt;The falsification principle has been battered into the ground across time, so I will only describe a few of the refutations here.59 First, it is simply not the case that any theories agree with all of the observable facts.^60 As the Nobel Prize recipient Francis Crick noted, ""[a]ny theory that fits all the facts is bound to be wrong, since some of the facts will be misleading or just wrong in themselves.""^61 One cannot abandon a theory whenever it makes a false prediction because science is a complicated undertaking and one cannot know if the falsification itself is correct.^62

&gt;In addition, everything that we think of as science could be falsified yet still be true. For example, if we re-enact Newton‘s apple scenario and the apple drifts away instead, the observation does not necessarily refute the laws of gravity. Some other force may have been in operation at the time.^63

&gt;Most important, although Popper‘s falsification principle was intended to distinguish between science and pseudo-science, falsification does not describe the way scientists actually operate. If science is about what we perceive and what we can verify, the definition seems to leave out a lot of how science has actually operated and what scientists do. As Lakatos pointed out, ""[h]ad Popper ever asked a Newtonian scientist under what experimental conditions he would abandon Newtonian theory, some Newtonian scientists would have been exactly as nonplussed as are some Marxists.""^64

I had heard of [Paul Davies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Davies) before and had associated him with a [theological perspective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mind_of_God), although it definitely looks like if he ever was of that inclination, he has since changed his mind.  He now believes it is possible to explain the laws of physics as an evolving and emergent phenomenon which need not have a cause preceding the existence of the Universe.

---

Descartes' explanation today sounds so embarassingly fanciful it's difficult to comprehend what such a brilliant mind, the same guy who doubted everything but his own existence, was thinking. His contemporary [Christiaan Huygens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens) said of it :
&gt; But indeed all the whole story of Comets and Planets and the Production of the World, is founded upon such poor and trifling grounds, that I have often wonder'd how an ingenious man could spend all that pains in making such fancies hang together.

In a nutshell, Descartes' Universe is populated by these bubble-like systems bustling around like [so](http://www.aip.org/history/cosmology/ideas/images-ideas/mech-svortices-lg.jpg). Inside these bubbles exist solar systems like ours completely full of matter of three kinds swirling around the system in bands. In each band there is a planet. At the centre of the system is the sun. Sunspots are kind of like scabs on a wound which leak matter and might cause the sun to be encroached upon by surrounding matter, and cause the now crusty sun to become a planet in an outer swirling band, or a comet weaving its way through other bubble systems. 

Believe it or not, this theory was quite popular among French thinkers well after Newton's gravity because it required no mysterious action-at-a-distance, was Copernican but still compatible with a biblical stationarity of the Earth (within its band). The presenters at the conference proposed that thinkers of this Baroque science era were radical realists playing a game among themselves of self-consistency and apparent complete explanability. Revising the theory or failing to explain a phenomenon was a sign of a serious weakness. **Fuller description of Descartes' theory available [here](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-physics/#7)**.

---

Alan Guth delivered the 2009 Isaac Newton Lecture for the Institute of Physics (Great Britain) **which you can watch in full [here](http://www.iop.org/news/archive/november/page_42348.html)**. In it he attempted to explain how the Universe formed and became what it is now using all known tools and theories available to him. In this model, he abandons conservation of energy but retains constancy of the speed of light. String theory is invoked for its highly flexible ability to assign unique vacuum theories complete with its own standard model to each pocket universe. Then the necessity of a very finely tuned cosmological constant for galaxies to form (and for us to exist) is explained away by applying the [anthropic principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle) to the multiverse. (Go ahead, shoot me, but the concept of a grand design is *almost* sounding more plausible to me by now). Guth himself is clearly atheist or agnostic stating in his post talk interview (available [here](http://www.iop.org/resources/videos/people-and-events/page_42749.html)) :
&gt; I've never found it useful to believe in an omniscient and omnipotent God who controls things.

---

Mr Descartes, Mr Guth, I deeply admire your superior powers of mathematical wizardry but please, consider - what is the chance that all the theoretical tools to build the perfect explanation of the Universe all just happen to be lying around your theory tool shed simultaneously as of 1647 or 2009? Is it so essential to patch together an ultrarealist picture of the Universe with whatever comes to hand just to keep God in or out of the picture? What is wrong with the perhaps more plausible ""we just don't really know yet"" explanation for the theory of the Universe?

&gt; The pages of the history of science record thousands of instances
of similar discoveries having been made by scientists working
independently of one another. Sometimes the discoveries are
simultaneous or almost so ; sometimes a scientist will make anew
a discovery which, unknown to him, somebody else had made years
before. Such occurrences suggest that discoveries become virtually
inevitable when prerequisite kinds of knowledge and tools accumulate in man's cultural store and when the attention of an appreciable number of investigators becomes focussed on a problem,
by emerging social needs, by developments internal to the science,
or by both. 

This view culminated in the [multiple discovery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery) theory of scientific discovery which rejects the [heroic theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroic_theory_of_invention_and_scientific_development) which claims science is written by a series of one-of-a-kind geniuses. 

An extensive list of multiple discoveries is posited [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiple_discoveries).

Merton's original paper ""Resistance to the Systematic Study of Multiple
Discoveries in Science"" can be downloaded [here](http://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B9y5Ze4Mo8qlYzk0MDFjYjItMWVjMS00NTNjLWI2NDItMjhhMzZmMGYzNDEy&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CJKw0IwE).

This is closely related to [Stigler's ""law""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler's_law) which posits that ""No scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer"" (which Stigler ironically attributes to Robert Merton).

I have a whole heap of sympathy for this view. To me, it is a great shame that genius must be delivered upon a platform of social constructs before it even has any hope of being recognised.

influence on my efforts and indeed E. Mach and still much more Hume, whose

Try multiplication-free Presburger arithmetic.,42,13,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/b4zfm/still_got_the_godelianincompleteness_blues_dont/,"*Originally posted in [/r/PhilosophyofScience](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience)*.

One of the fascinating things about the Godel incompleteness results is that infinity itself is not the problem. In some systems of arithmetic you can believe you can count to infinity and still be complete and consistent. Some even include the [infinite set of induction axioms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction).

One such decidable arithmetic system is known as **[Presburger arithmetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic)**. Presburger arithmetic is essentially the [Peano axioms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms) without multiplication defined. Actually, multiplication is allowed in this system, just not between two variables - multiplication by constants is allowed. So statements like this are allowed 
    Exists x Forall y,z (10*x + 56*y - 28*z &lt; 1873 AND (12*y - 86*x + 32*z) &gt; 3298 
whereas Fermat's last theorem is not 
    Exists X, Y, N (X^N + Y^N = Z^N AND N&gt;2).
[Presburger showed his arithmetic was decidable](http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a776183056&amp;db=all) before Godel's incompleteness results were even published. **[This page has an applet](http://www.stefan-baur.de/cs.web.mashup.presburger.html) which lets you define your own Presburger statements and illustrates how they are solved** (Note : only in German but still interesting to play with).

Yet the incompleteness problem is not even due to multiplication alone. A system with all of Peano's axioms apart from addition, but inclusive of multiplication [was shown by Thorlaf Skolem to be complete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoralf_Skolem#Mathematics). The completeness problem derives from the combination of addition and multiplication on variables. These operations together provide the ability to construct the [Godel numbering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godel_numbering) by allowing the definition of the unique prime factorisation of every integer and the mechanism by which Godel's unprovable statement can be constructed. 

So we have yet more demonstration of how easy it is to skirt Godelian incompleteness. The Godelian incompleteness results are really about carefully choosing the formal language concepts we use to describe systems we wish to use. The real problem faced by humans is not even Godelian-incompleteness, its [computational complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity). Even solving relatively small problems of Presburger arithmetic takes [impossibly large amounts of time](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PresburgerArithmetic.html).

Incidentally, [Presburger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger) was a student of [Alfred Tarski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski). Tarski was considerably more prolific than Godel, extending the Godelian results in many directions. Presburger unfortunately died in a Nazi concentration camp.",,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,,True,t3_b4zfm,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/b4zfm/still_got_the_godelianincompleteness_blues_dont/,

Unlike the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment which used poison gas and a radioactive decay trigger, this version involves a life-terminating device and a device that measures the spin value of protons. Every 10 seconds, the spin value of a fresh proton is measured. Conditioned upon that quantum bit, the weapon is either deployed, killing the experimenter, or it makes an audible ""click"" and the experimenter survives.

The theories are distinctive from the point of view of the experimenter only; their predictions are otherwise identical.

The probability of surviving the first iteration of the experiment is 50%, under both interpretations, as given by the squared norm of the wavefunction. At the start of the second iteration, if the Copenhagen interpretation is true, the wavefunction has already collapsed, so if the experimenter is already dead, there's a 0% chance of survival. However, if the many-worlds interpretation is true, a superposition of the live experimenter necessarily exists, regardless of how many iterations or how improbable the outcome. Barring life after death, it is not possible for the experimenter to experience having been killed, thus the only possible experience is one of having survived every iteration.",,False,,t5_2r7mh,False,,,True,t3_1j88ia,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/1j88ia/can_someone_help_me_understand_this_quantum/,

Critics of ID point out numerous features in nature that suggest if ID were real, the Creator would've fixed it. For instance, humans are one of few mammals that choke on their food.

But is ID a scientific claim? Assuming Methological Naturalism:
1) Scientific claims must be testable
2) Supernatural claims are not testable
--&gt; claims about supernatural causes are not scientific

Regardless if the theory's wrong or not, proponents of ID say it's a scientific claim. However, in ""Science and Religion,"" Asher claims that ID does not emphasize the ""distinction between agency and cause."" While it explains the why and who, it does not explain the how. Therefore, ID is not a scientific claim.

As an aside, I don't like to hide my libertarian tilt and when I hear of a private group accomplishing in 2-3 years and for ~ $300 mln (which would have been a bit higher as some of the genome was sequenced when Celera started) something it took a public approach 10 years (which could have been longer had Celera not forced the project to accelerate) and $3 bln, I usually side with the private approach. I've also worked in the public sector with medical genetics and have attempted to obtain a few gene patents so I understand a bit of the good and bad behind them. Yet in all of my travels, rarely do I see anyone praise Dr. Venter.

(pdf)](http://www.math.utah.edu/~palais/pi.pdf)**. He believes Pi is confusing and contrived and should be replaced by the constant , 2xPi which he calls [Tau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_\(2\%CF\%80\)). 

The argument seems to appeal to tenets of clarity and elegance. It's 2xPi radians that make up a full circle. e^i*pi = -1 but e^i*tau = 1. A slew of mathematical formulae (Cauchy's integral equation,  Fourier transforms, sin/cos periodicity) all explicitly involve the constant 2xPi as do equations in physics (Maxwell's equations, Guass' law, Ampere's law, Planck's constant, Dirac's constant). 

So Palais has joined with others to create a website for what they call  [The Tau Manifesto](http://tauday.com/) and intend to celebrate [anti-Pi day](http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-06-math-wars-debate-anti-pi-day.html).

Did we screw up somewhere [historically](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#History) or is elegance in mathematics purely aesthetic, and in physics, inconsequential to likely validity? Or is pi elegant enough as it is?

I was dismayed to see an original post to science where redditors were giving answers like ""logic"" and ""reason"" to this answer.


To be sure, there are concepts derived from scientific investigation but logic is not one of them.

Logic and reason are extra-scientific concepts. Logic is a branch of mathematics ( a non science). Reason predates science by aeons. The edge question itself is ill-conceived sloppy thinking. They even try to define ""scientific"" as ""the most reliable way to gain knowledge"" about anything. In logic this would be an example of a tautology. 

I was surprised to see how many of the answers on the edge site were non-scientifically derived concepts. Am I missing something here?",,False,,t5_2r7mh,False,,,True,t3_f38cn,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/f38cn/problem_with_2011_edge_question_what_scientific/,

Just kidding, /r/science doesn't allow self text posts.

The question is: why is everything here? I'm not concerned with when it began, or if it's always been here, or how it works (not right here anyway), but rather... why is anything here at all? Does science even attempt to explain this? If so, could you guys direct me to some relevant reading material?

I can imagine how life evolved from matter (well, not even that really, about which I'm very curious) but where did matter (or energy, or what have you) come from? And if it didn't come from anywhere, what the hell is it doing here?

TL;DR Seriously, I want to know, why is there stuff? Does science attempt to provide an answer to this question?

EDIT: I feel like I've gotten a lot of flak on here for asking ""why"" as opposed to a ""how"" or a ""what"" question. I was never intending to imply a purpose to the universe, although some on here are arguing that you can't ask a ""why"" question without implying a purpose. I respectfully disagree, but, regardless of that fact, I guess I should have worded the question better.

Next time around I think I'll be asking people the question ""how is it possible"" that the universe exists. And from the few people on here who played along with my ""why"" question and interpreted it as a ""how"", it seems like science, at this time, does not have a uniform opinion regarding this.

I computed a correlation matrix for the fields of interests, only used significant correlations (p &lt; 0.05) and used the correlation between two fields as the weight between those two nodes of the graph. Additionally, the size of a node is proportional to the square root of how represented that interest is. Physics is more popular than medicine, and therefore the physics node is larger. I hope the abbreviations used are transparent.

After a few hours with OpenOfficeCalc, Rkward, and Neato, [here's what the map looks like](http://imgur.com/Mk4fe.png).

Math is actually more highly correlated with physics than computer science, but due to the compromises necessary to get a 2d-graph representation ends up slightly further away. A work around might be to specify edge lengths rather than weights, but this would lead to a less aesthetically pleasing graph.

Teaching Company.,30,5,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/d8jpt/kants_theory_of_space_and_time_video_teaching/,"This is a lecture from the Teaching Company's course called Mathematics, Philosophy and the ""Real World"". Details available [here](http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=1440). Information on Professor Grabiner [here](http://www.teach12.com/storex/professor.aspx?id=373). She is an historian of mathematics. 

By way of background, as I recall, Kant was so disturbed by Hume's challenge to the absoluteness of scientific knowledge by the limitations of the senses (and the problem of induction), that Kant proposed that Newtonian concepts of space and time must be built into the human mind itself, i.e. that they are [synthetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic-synthetic_distinction), [a priori truths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori), thereby separating them from the fallibility of the senses. **Kant was trying to put physics on the same epistemological foundations as mathematics itself.** As Professor Grabiner points out, many great thinkers believed physics and mathematics to be intimately intertwined. At the time, the axiomatic status of [Euclid's fifth postulate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate) was hotly debated - could it be derived from the other four postulates or not?

I recommend the course if you are interested in the philosophy of mathematics at all. Professor Grabiner is a terrific teacher (notwithstanding what some may say is her occasionally annoying voice) in my opinion. But I would recommend holding off buying it until they pull one of their 70% discounts. Alternatively, find it from ...ahem... other sources.

",31,6,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/f5hmb/utter_damned_rot_continental_drift_and_an/,"*There is no idea however ancient and absurd that is not capable of improving our knowledge. The whole history of thought is absorbed into science and is used for improving every single theory. Nor is political interference rejected. It may be needed to overcome the chauvinism of science that resists alternatives to the status quo.*

This is the opening quote of chapter 4 of Paul Feyerabend's book [Against Method](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feyerabend/#2.13). We've discussed the book [in the past](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/catcy/feyerabend_against_method/) from time to time and I think it adds a lot to the methodology debate. Feyerabend himself near the end of his life went on to say how much he despised the book. I suspect though he had just come to regret his occasional flirting with relativism. 

But this quote highlights to me, not only the logical futility of trying to demarcate science from pseudo-science, but the practical futility of it as well. Consider [Alfred Wegener](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/wegener.html)'s theory of [continental drift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift). By looking at the map of the world, Wegener, a ""mere"" German meteorologist, was convinced the continents once formed part of a great whole which had since drifted apart. A prominent physicist at the time, Adrian Schiedegger, published a paper [""Examination of the physics of theories of orogenesis""](http://bulletin.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/64/2/127) which provided several physical arguments why the continental drift hypothesis was impossible, just a few years before it was legitimised by the study of [plate tectonics](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/geology/tectonics.html). See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift#Rejection_of_Wegener.27s_theory.2C_and_subsequent_vindication).

Wegener was attacked profusely from all academic sides. Wegener was considered an interloper and continental drift threatened the status quo in many disciplines. 

&gt; ""Utter damned rot!""

 wrote the president of the prestigious American Philosophical Society.

&gt; Anyone who ""valued his reputation for scientific sanity"" would never dare support such a theory,

wrote one British geologist.


Chief antagonist, geologist R. Thomas Chamberlain wrote : 

&gt; ""If we are to believe in Wegener's hypothesis we must forget everything which has been learned in the past 70 years and start all over again.""

Well, at least they got that right.

How would you address Descartes' argument?,29,3,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/bdrjy/a_question_to_the_physicalists_what_is/,"Note : This is quite a metaphysical question for me but Rene Descartes really did demonstrate some serious brilliance in mathematics as well as in the sciences, so it's hard for me to be completely apathetic towards his more pure philosophical musings.  By the way, for those wtf-ing, [Wikipedia on physicalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism).

---

I was reading (actually listening to) Rene Descartes' [""Discourse on Method for Reasoning Well and for Seeking Truth in the Sciences""](http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/descartes/descartes1.htm). This is the famous essay where he comes up with ""I think therefore I am"" (Part 4). As I understand the argument, he reasons we cannot be sure of our senses nor the sciences :

&gt; *considering that all the same thoughts which we have when awake can also come to us when we are asleep, without there being truth in any of them at the time, I determined to pretend that everything which had ever entered my mind was no more true than the illusions of my dreams.*

so is there anything we (actually ""I"" - it's a very personal argument - if you read all of it, he clearly doesn't want to tell anyone what they should believe) can be sure of? He says well I can be sure that I am doubting everything so the fact that I am thinking about these things means I, at least, must exist :

&gt; *But immediately afterwards I noticed that, while I wished in this way to think everything was false, it was necessary that I—who was doing the thinking—had to be something. Noticing that this truth—I think; therefore, I am—was so firm and so sure that all the most extravagant assumptions of the sceptics would not be able to weaken it, I judged that I could accept it without scruple as the first principle of the philosophy I was looking for.*

What I didn't know though, was that this was all couched in a ""proof"" for the existence of God. Now Rene was a very accomplished mathematician - having developed an [algebraic axiomatisation of Euclidean geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#History) for example. What he then goes on to do is to liken the existence of mathematics with the existence of God in the following passage : 

&gt; *After that I wanted to look for other truths, and I proposed to myself the subject matter of geometricians, which I understood as a continuous body or a space extended indefinitely in length, width, and height or depth, divisible into various parts, which could have various figures and sizes and be moved or transposed in all sorts of ways, for the geometricians assume all that in their subject matter. I glanced through some of their simplest proofs, and having observed that this grand certainty which all the world attributes to them is founded only on the fact that they plan these proofs clearly, following the rule which I have so often stated, I notice also that there is nothing at all in their proofs which assures me of the existence of their objects. So, for example, I do see that, if we assume a triangle, it must the case that its three angles are equal to two right angles, but, in spite of that, I don't see anything which assures me that there is a triangle in the world. But, by contrast, once I returned to an examination of the idea which I had of a perfect being, I found that that being contains the idea of existence in the same way as the fact the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles is contained in the idea of a triangle, or that in a sphere all the parts are equidistant from the centre, or something even more evident, and that, as a result, it is at just as certain that God, this perfect being, is or exists as any geometric proof can be.*

Now I don't want to get into a religious debate on the existence of God here. But Rene makes a valid point about mathematics doesn't he? Mathematics doesn't exist anywhere in the physical world (e.g. we can't see a mathematical triangle), it exists only in our minds, yet it exposes truths that everybody who ever exists must agree on, some of the results are astounding elegant and amazing, it is incredibly useful for many physical pursuits, yet try to point to any physical evidence of it and it's nowhere to be seen.

So what *is* mathematics? Is it just a human construction? Then why is it so perfect and universally indisputable, practically useful and [often beautiful](http://www.cut-the-knot.org/manifesto/beauty.shtml)?

Having recently read *God Delusion* and *Greatest Show* and in discussing them with fellow evolution enthusiasts and proponents, I think relegating morality to an evolutionary development a bit misguided.

That's not to say I misunderstand evolution and think it can only evolve selfish species, non-social species, not at all. It's glaringly obvious to me that weaker animals (relatively speaking) have greater payoffs (to speak in game theory terms), particularly when coordination can give greater results per individual than would the sum of individual efforts (in collecting food in the form of large prey, say).

What Dawkins has taught me when he talks about beneficial cooperative interactions *isn't* that evolution has provided us with morality of any sort but rather a set of heuristic strategies for living in a certain environment. Think about how two troops of apes will interact when they come into contact. In spite of being capable of quite moving gentleness and affection towards one another, the interaction of whole troops can be very aggressive and even dangerous. An ape will not automatically feel affection for an out-group individual like he or she will for an in-group member. That affection for other apes is selective; it's purely racist.

The reasons for this, speaking strategically, aren't hard to see. Obviously self-preservation through cooperation make banding together into groups quite beneficial. Once in a group, you will develop a reputation and the others will get to know how generous or selfish you are and treat you in kind. If you are kind, other apes will treat you fondly, more likely to look after you if you are ill, etc.. If you are selfish, others will not think much of letting you have a harder time of it.

Now when it comes to members of other groups, you only have to worry about how your own group will treat you so there is potentially plenty to gain and little to lose (your friends will presumably come to your defence) from trying to, for example, steal from individuals of other troops. 

Given that, treating familiar individuals positively and unfamiliar individuals negatively is the equilibrium here, the most stable strategy.

So it's very easy to see where this racism comes from, or any kind of demonising by difference (sexism, nationalism, etc.). But since we're a global society with billions of members now instead of our classic hunter-gatherer groups, suddenly in-group/out-group thinking *isn't* very advantageous any more.

Here is where I think real morality comes in. I have come to think that morality is when we use our intellect and our reason to think about relationships and take into account everything about the interactions and come to the decision to *over rule* our natural propensities. When we decide to treat all humans equally is when we're deciding to disregard our native heuristic because it is no longer advantageous any more.

So in short, I don't think evolution produces morality in behaviours (directly) but these kind of un-reasoned situational strategies, and that it takes a rational mind to produce morality. I see that this is a kind of a judgement call on the definition of morality, but at the very least I'm hoping to show that the development of evolved behaviour strategies and reasoned morality are categorically different things.

I had a disagreement with a psychology instructor today.

My instructor was explaining the scientific method and said that the first step in science was to think of a theory, then test it, then observe it and then create a hypothesis that explains your results.

I said that she had it completely backwards and convoluted, and that science first starts with observation &gt; hypothesis &gt; testing a hypothesis &gt; falsifying or supporting the hypothesis &gt; then a theory can be developed.

She stated that that might be correct with ""hard science"", but in social science, you start with a theory in your head, and then find out how to test it, and the end result is a hypothesis.

Am I wrong? If so, why?

Whenever I hear someone pulling out a God-of-the gaps arguments, I have to squint my eyes a wee bit more and ask if they can tie their own shoes in the morning. The problem with the God of the gaps is that it's so flimsy:

(1) I don't know the answer to X

(2) God did X

You see that kind of underhanded bullshit from the Discovery Institute so much that their press releases look like Mad Libs: ""----- doesn't have a current Naturalist Scientific explanation, therefore ------."" No one with any intellectual honesty could print that without suffering a brain aneurysm. The problem *isn't* that by the time the ink is dry scientists have found an explanation/fossil/genetic link that patches up the hole, it's that you can plug whatever bullshit you want in to the DI press release and their solution still doesn't tell us anything new.

I call that the *non-answer*: don't you dare provide some kind of explanatory content to your answer, just make it a big-enough muddle that everyone loses interest. If blood clotting turns out to have an explanation, then move on to the evolution of the eye. If that doesn't work, don't ever admit you've made any past mistakes; press on, Hannibal! It's the empty response of a child or Senator caught with his hand in the cookie jar or paramour: the child or Senator just divert attention long enough for everyone else to move on to the latest panty-flash photo of a starlet.

**II.**

The current problem in the debate over Methodological Naturalism, at least as I see it, is that the natural/supernatural distinction-game is played backwards, probably as a result of taking words to mean the Essence of the word. Science adopts Methodological Naturalism, of course, because Science is Essentially Applied Naturalism. And Naturalism? It's the study of whatever is Natural, of course. And Natural? It's whatever is Testable. By the way, whatever is Supernatural is whatever is untestable. Game over. 

Sorry if I sound a bit peeved, but that's a complete cop-out. Phillip Johnson, the founder of ID, *does* have a legitimate objection: by *a priori* defining science as unable to test supernatural claims, there's no explanation as to *why* 'supernatural' solutions don't cut the mustard. They've just defined it by fiat. So let's turn it around for a sec and try it this way:

Scientists are interested in solving problems. If your solution has no explanatory content *besides* a name, it cannot be checked by criticism. You're not giving a solution; you're giving a name, and the solution should be damned for its inability to be criticized. *There's nothing there!* If you're going to be taken seriously by scientists, you need to explain how you think it works. You know, provide some explanatory content, some meat other scientists can chew on, something scientists can *criticize*.

And as it so happens, most traditionally supernatural claims offer no explanatory content. Some supernatural claims *do* have a great deal of explanatory content, but they haven't survived any sort of rigorous examination. However, these non-answer traditionally supernatural claims are just *a small subset* of all the non-answers available. The distinction between 'supernatural' and 'natural' answers is *at most* misleading labels for saying ""I'll call it Gary the Monster. Don't ask me how Gary does it, or why, because who the fuck knows?"" and ""Here's how I think it works. Bonus: here's how it can be tested.""

&gt;Private truth is even more important.  As a scientist interacting with your experiments, you receive an education in the implacability of truth and in your own capacity to be deceived by your expectations, your hopes, or just your stupidity, that is unlike any other experience I know.  And you may find the worst deceit in what religious people might call inspiration or revelation.  We all know the euphoria that comes from suddenly seeing something in a new light, and the more elements that seem to take part in the new pattern, the stronger the feeling.  But as every scientist finds out, the feeling is not less strong for mistaken visions than for those that will survive a cold examination. You must lean over backwards, as Feynman put it, to resist belief.  All this is very different from the attitude in other professions.

&gt;  For a politician, truth is something to hide and twist, and to tell only when it is entirely favourable.  For the media, truth is of secondary importance except sometimes as a defence to an action for libel or slander. 

&gt; For advertising people, truth is like the pinch of baking powder in a muffin—it puffs up a mass of misdirection into something that the public will swallow.

&gt;  For lawyers, decisions have to be reached on incomplete and at times artificially restricted data.  The legal profession insists on making witnesses swear an impossible oath about the truth, but its members do not take that oath, and its judges are less interested in the discovery of truth than in the observation of legal form.

Einstein was a big fan of Moritz Schlick, one of the founders, and even helped him obtain the position at the University of Vienna, that his mentor, Ernst Mach had previously occupied. Einstein and Schlick agreed that the challenge facing philosophers of physics was to devise a new empiricism capable of defending Einstein's new physics against the neo-Kantian ""a-priorists"". More info [here](http://philosopedia.org/index.php/Moritz_Schlick#Einstein).

He grew increasingly disillusioned with the movement over the years. In 1953, Einstein was asked to write a forward to a collection of Rudolph Carnap's essays. [He declined saying](http://books.google.com/books?id=Wta7qyP9agYC&amp;lpg=PA9020work&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) -

**I.**

Most everyone knows the story of Oedipus meeting the Sphinx -- how he bests it by solving its riddle, goes off to Thebes, nails his mom, and ruins his life. So what?

The Sphinx is four things in one: the body of a lioness, the torso of a woman, the wings of an eagle, and the tail of a serpent -- she is part of the primordial world of chaos, full of monsters and those dark scary things that are hiding just behind you when you're in the dark, born before the first gods came. *Ooga booga!*

Oedipus's story is similar to its historical precedents: Achilles beats down a river god, Gilgamesh kills Humbaba, Perseus decapitates Medusa, Odysseus defeats the cyclops -- and its antecedents: St. George defeats the dragon, [all those kids confronting It](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_%28novel%29), etc. [These are very popular stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_%28cosmogony%29). It's part of the story of the culture hero versus the chaos monster, where the hero fights, then subdues the chaos monster and returns to the village or city-state, where he is showered with praise, women, and money, and if lucky, might ascend to god-hood. Everyone is safe forever. Cue credits.

**II.**

However, there is something different about Oedipus's story: his besting of the Sphinx is not through brawn, but through his cleverness. He doesn't strike down the Sphinx; he reveals its secrets, unravels the riddle.

And what of Oedipus? His power the extent to which he can extend or express his Will. This is a trap that will snare Oedipus: he begins to feel that he can control his own life solely from the influence of his Will; he produces order or a paradigm from which to view/influence the world; he places limits on the world around him, makes boundaries. Yeah, the guy's a smart mother fucker. But that's not enough. No matter how smart Oedipus is, no matter how strongly he exerts his Will onto others, the world pushes back. That's why even though he tried to change the course of history, he unwittingly kills his dad, nails his mom, and generally screws up the lives of everyone in Thebes. His mental map of the world is inconsequential to the unknowable forces that influence his life.

We can give meaning to our lives by acting out into the world, solving our problems, making maps and sorting our world into boxes. We can explain everything we encounter if we just impose our Will. Therefore, *culturally, solving the riddles of the universe is the same as killing the chaos-monster.*

**III.**

The problem is that *we* are dealing with a chaos-monster that will not die. The chaos that bubbles underneath the surface doesn't follow this traditional narrative. It's not The Hero With a Thousand Faces or a Positivist understanding of approaching certainty. It is the many-headed Hydra, and each time we cut off one head, another two grow to take its place. Science is a never-ending *chaoskampf* against the chaos that is so far beyond our comprehension. If we were to discover the way things truly were, we would be unable to cope with such a shift in understanding, for the world is vast, dark, and indifferent.

Newton? He thought he could explain away the mystery and failed. Bohr's model of the atom couldn't stand up.

**IV.**

Think of the world's reaction to Einstein: he was hailed as a hero, as (edit) Prometheus bringing down fire. Women fainted at his lectures, he received ticker-tape parades, and so on. 

He was Time's Person of the 20th Century, for goodness sake! Later in life he was treated like a saint, practically the right hand of the dice-throwing god. 

And yet, his theories were not the final blow; the monster, the destruction of our paradigms, keeps coming back, and yet we see it only as a small patch-job for the foundations of science.

Do you honestly think the human mind, as fallible as it is,  can defeat such a chaos monster?

The Duhem problem can be expressed as follows: 

&gt;A physicist disputes a certain law; he calls into doubt a certain theoretical point. How will be justify these doubts?  From the proposition under indictment he will derive the prediction of an experimental fact; he will bring into existence the conditions under which this fact should be produced; if the predicted fact is not produced, the proposition which served as the basis of the prediction will be irremediably condemned. (Duhem,  The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory, Princeton University Press. Translated from the French by Philip P. Wiener.1954, p. 184)

&gt;By means of this mode of inference we falsify the whole system (the theory as well as the initial conditions) which was required for the deduction of the statement p, i.e. of the falsified statement. Thus it cannot be asserted of any one statement of the system that it is, or is not, specifically upset by the falsification. Only if p is independent of some part of the system can we say that this part is not involved in the falsification. (Popper, *The Logic of Scientific Discovery*, 76)

A naive theory of science might say that when testing a theory T, if an observation-statement O is found to agree or disagree with the logical consequences of T, O either supports or refutes T. This can be expressed as follows:

1. If T is true, then O is true.

2. Not-O.

3. T is false.

However, theories do not exist in a vacuum. Scientists adopt unproblematical auxiliary hypotheses or theories, along with metaphysical assumptions, which I will refer to as 'background knowledge' (K). Since the scientist accepts a great deal of background knowledge, *including conjectures about the validity of the observation report*, the status of the modus tollens argument looks something like this:

1. If T and K1 and K1 ... and Kn is true, then O is true.

2. Not-O.

3. Either T or K1 or K2 ... or Kn is false.

A 'critical experiment', by which I mean a supposed decisive, justified falsification of a theory by appealing to an observation-report, is never as decisive as one would wish. Either the theory under examination is false, or a piece of the background knowledge, including how the test was prepared, is false. Thus, there are three possible choices the scientist can make: either they (1) protect the fundamental theory by suggesting an error in the experimental setup, (2) challenge one piece of the background knowledge, or (3) challenge the theory.

**II. A methodological response to the logical problem**

No matter the choice made by the scientist, there is no guarantee of success. The Duhem problem is the way things are, and is insurmountable to every and all philosophy of science that takes the link between testing and theory into account. Thus, criticizing any particular philosophy of science by resorting to the Duhem problem does not discredit the theory, since there are, and can be, no other approaches that eliminate the theory-dependence, even if these theories are implicit, of observation-reports. Duhem, though, provided an early methodological or heuristic to follow: he hoped that the theory, along with the background knowledge, would develop in such a way as to account for a wider range of phenomena, to 'adhere more closely to reality'. This methodological rule -- increase the range of predicted phenomena -- is one of several proposed rules that, while not justifying the truth of any theory (for no justification can be found), keeps scientific practice from becoming insular or hermeneutic.

There is no logic or automatic method for determining if the theory, background knowledge, or observation-report is mistaken. There is only more work to be done. Scientists when confronted with a falsifying observation-report can adopt several very different strategies, ranging from revision or rejection of the theory, modification of background knowledge, or denial of the observation-report. Both Popper and Duhem proposed similar principles for the scientist, namely that criticism should first be directed towards the competing theories rather than background knowledge, and a check of the observation-report to determine if it is the result of experimental error.

(As an aside, I should note that while I think Popper's demarcation criteria of falsifiability of statements -- that there must exist, at least in principle, a possible conflict between a universal statement and an existential statement -- has been superseded by Bartley's demarcation criteria of the *criticizability* of statements -- a proposal is rationally adopted if there are some significant criticisms that it has overcome, the Duhem problem does not invalidate Popper's solution to the demarcation problem. Popper stressed in his *Logic* that the assumed background knowledge, along with initial conditions, are necessary in order to test a theory. The Duhem problem is only directed at any singular attempt at falsifying a theory: it's much harder than you'd think.)

**III. Clarifying the response**

&gt;... if we take each of the two theories (between which the crucial experiment is to decide) together with all this background knowledge, as indeed we must, then we decide between two systems *which differ only over the two theories which are at stake*.  It further overlooks the fact that we do not assert the refutation of the theory as such, but of the theory together with that background knowledge; parts of which, if other crucial experiments can be designed, may indeed one day be rejected as responsible for the failure. (Popper, *Conjectures and Refutations*, 1963, 112, italics mine)

Popper is on to something of importance here: there may be many cases in the history of science where two different systems differ only in the two competing theories in question. In this case, after putting aside any experimental error (this is why theories must be in principle interpersonally and repeatedly testable), it may be possible to prefer the surviving theory over the refuted theory after a crucial experiment. However, there do exist other cases where the two rival systems are divided by many assumptions. This is the kind of revolutionary science described by Kuhn's paradigm theory. 

These situations are somewhat rare and not as revolutionary as one would think, since a great amount of knowledge, even in close proximity to the revolution, remain intact. However, these are the kind of situations where a great amount of time may be needed to parse out the implications of the rival systems until one system appears to be superior to the other. This may take decades. It may be better to keep two competing theories that are presently equally corroborated by the present data than jumping the gun and choosing one over the other. Between these two extreme situations, there exist a spectrum of time and energy necessary, along with a spectrum of crucial to not-so-crucial tests that can be conducted, to resolve the problem of which rival theory is to be preferred.

**IV. The distinction between '*ad hoc*' and 'auxiliary hypotheses'**

An *ad hoc* adjustment or 'saving throw' is an addition or change to background knowledge that weaken the chances to put it to the test. As I note in [*The problem with ad hoc adjustments to thoeries*](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/cy8o9/the_problem_with_ad_hoc_adjustments_to_theories/), any sort of *ad hoc* adjustment immunizes the theory from criticism and reduces it content. There can be no change if the 'hard core' of a theory is allowed to be protected from criticism. Since it is always possible to modify theories so as to 'save' them from refutation, Popper appealed to the methodological decision *not to avoid refutations*.

Auxiliary hypotheses may be introduced, as Popper and Duhem point out, if they can be tested independently of the theory they are intended to 'save'. For instance, the auxiliary hypothesis of the existence of the planet Neptune was introduced to account for the irregularities in the orbit of Uranus. This addition to the background knowledge is not *ad hoc* in nature, since the location of the hypothetical planet was predicted with great precision. Thus, Neptune was located rapidly by two independent observers, making a significant problem for Newtonian theory into a vindication for the theory when an exactly predicted unobserved planet was put to the test. In short, the introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis *strengthens* the theoretical system only if it increases the chances to put it to the test.

Popper adopts this preference for auxiliary hypotheses over *ad hoc* adjustments not due to any sort of justification (this path isn't open to anyone due to the failures of justificationism; see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/d1gwj/a_short_review_of_the_long_history_of_the_problem/)), but as a *tentative proposal*. It very well may be the case that in some instances, *ad hoc* adjustments may save a *true* theory; however, there would be no way to determine whether or not the theory is true or false in this case, since it has made it *verboten* to test it in some way. If scientists want each progressive theory to explain more about the world than the theories they supersede, any sort of adjustment to a theory must explain more about the world, that is, be as testable as possible.

The author of the paper [Why Scientists Gather Evidence](https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B7EH8NEV9bzAMTMxOTIyMjUtMGY3OC00N2MxLTllNmMtMzlmYTJjNjRkMTJl&amp;hl=en) argues that a satisfactory philosophy of science must therefore be able to adequately explain why scientist do gather evidence.

The author, Patrick Maher, argues that neither Popperian nor Kuhnian  philosophies adequately answer this question. Analyzing the Popperian philosophical framework, he argues that the gathering of evidence is counterproductive due to its potential to move scientists away from the truth, and any explanation of its usefulness would require acceptance of an inductive reasoning.

Kuhn's ability to answer the question is also discarded. The gathering of evidence has potential to reduce accuracy of a theory, should the evidence be anomalous. It also has the potential to lead to the acceptance of a theory that is not the most simple. Either of these may occur through the gathering of evidence without necessarily increasing other scientific value of the theory (eg consistency), thus gathering evidence cannot be considered a rational way to advance science.

The author proposes that Bayesian theory provides numerous acceptable explanations as to why scientists gather evidence. Gathering evidence logically modifies the Bayesian probability given to a theory. The author argues that if even when there is a cost to gathering evidence, it increases [Savage's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._J._Savage) subjective expected utility of the choice made after the action and is therefore a rational act. He also presents argument based on [Good's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._J._Good) decision theory to support a Bayesian explanation. This wiki on [decision theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory) was also helpful.

I found the article educational and would be interested in your opinions, particularly if you have a preference for a Popperian philosophy.

(Must-listen MP3 of his 1974 lecture).,24,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/c7vej/falsificationism_20_imre_lakatoss_concepts_of/,"[Imre Lakatos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imre_Lakatos) was a Hungarian philosopher of mathematics and science who studied under Popper at the London School of Economics. Some influential philosophers believe the Lakatosian approach to the philosophy of science is still unsuperceded.

Lakatos, in my reading, tried to reconcile Popper's falsificationism with the actual practice of science as expounded by [Thomas Kuhn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions). Lakatos rejected Kuhn's notions of scientific revolutions as unrealistic and Popper's falsificationism as naive. Instead, Lakatos argued that theories are couched in a ""protective belt"" of auxiliary hypotheses which can be modified to rescue the core theory when empirical evidence appears to run contrary to the theory's predictions. He called the combination of this core theory with the protective belt of assumptions a ""research program"". 

He divides these research programs into ""progressive"" and ""degenerating"" research programs. Progressive research programs all predict novel facts - either undreampt of, or contradicted by rival programs. In degenerating research programs, theories are modified only in order to accommodate known facts. He then argues that scientific revolutions rarely occur as dramatically as Kuhn describes - research programs degenerate over time and are replaced by progressive research programs.

In some sense then you could view Lakatos' philosophy as a historiographical upgrade to Popperian falsificationism to reflect the way that science occurs in practice.

Anyway don't take my word for it - you can hear him speak about it. If this interests you at all, you absolutely must listen to the **[recording of his ""Science and Pseudoscience"" lecture at LSE (mp3)](http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/lakatos/scienceAndPseudoscience48.mp3)** in 1974 shortly before he died suddenly at age 51. It is only 20 minutes long and succinctly captures his entire philosophy of science. Lakatos reputedly was an entertaining speaker, much respected and liked by his academic adversaries (like Paul Feyerabend). You might find his voice a little difficult to understand but I really appreciated his dramatic, very Hungarian style of speaking.  More information on the talk [can be found here](http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/lakatos/scienceAndPseudoscience.htm).

-----------------

One of the aims of science, perhaps its most fundamental aim, is knowledge — not of past events — but of future events. Scientists want to 'read the book of nature', to borrow a phrase from Bacon. &lt;Bacon? Why, I *love* bacon!&gt; Think of the laws of nature as being general truths, or as they're known in predicate logic, *universal statements* (""for all x, y""). So the question, to rephrase [David Byrne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiEpH4mQRMQ) is, *how do I get there?* How can scientists grasp hold of the laws of nature?

The popular answer is by 'inductive inference', called by Aristotle ""the passage from individuals to universals"" [1]. Inductive inference usually takes the following form:

     This bacon is crispy.
     That bacon is crispy.
     ...
     Therefore, all bacon is crispy. 

&lt;[Hope it's bacon for me!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nT9P8MMpsE)&gt;

Scientists may infer that a universal statement holds when they have observed a sufficient number of instances of the law. Corroborating scientific theories through repeated testing is the key. And then there was Sextu-

And then there was Hume. [2]

Hume's problem of induction is quite simple: you can't get there from here. His argument is the following:

     (1) General laws are attained by inductive inference.
     (2) Inductive inference is unjustified.
     (3) If an inference is unjustified, it cannot count as knowledge.
     Therefore, we cannot have knowledge of general laws.

A common characteristic of all deductive logics is that the conclusion of a valid inference is implicit in the premises; or, the conclusion cannot have a greater logical content than the conjunction of the premises. Since there is no content-increasing inferences in logic, *the problem of logical inference from existential statements to universal statements is unsolvable*.

The proof runs as follows. Let the statements ""This is a piece of bacon and it is crispy"" (B*a*), ""This is a second piece of bacon and it is crispy"" (B*b*) ... up to B*r* be true. Assume that *s* has not yet been tested for the property of crispiness.

If B*a*⋀B*c*⋀B*d*⋀ ... ⋀B*r* ⇒ B*s* were analytic, then B*s* could not be false, should B*a*, B*c*, B*d*, ... B*r* all be true. This logical inference would provide all the inductive inference scientists need. But should B*a*, B*c*, B*d*, ... B*r* be all true, B*s* may still be false, so the if-then statement would also be false. Hence it is not an analytic truth, for counterexamples are conceivable. *There is no logical inference to be made from past experience to future experiences.*

As Karl Popper said, ""...any conclusion drawn in this way may always turn out to be false: no matter how many instances of white swans we have observed, this does not justify the conclusion that *all* swans are white."" [3] No finite number of existential statements — such as ""This is a piece of bacon and it is crispy"" — implies a universal statement such as ""All bacon is crispy"".

Popper again: 

&gt;I formulate Hume's logical problem of induction as follows: 

&gt;(L1) Can the claim that an explanatory universal theory is true be justified by 'empirical reasons'; that is, by assuming the truth of certain test statements or observation statements (which, it may be said, are 'based on experience')? 

&gt;My answer to the problem is the same as Hume's: No, it cannot; no number of true statements would justify the claim that an explanatory universal theory is true. 

&gt;There is a second logical problem, L2, which is a generalization of L1. It is obtained from L1 merely by replacing the words 'is true' by the words 'is true or that it is false':

&gt;(L2) Can the claim that an explanatory universal theory is true or that it is false be justified by 'empirical reasons'; that is, by assuming the truth of certain test statements or observation statements (which, it may be said, are 'based on experience')? 

&gt;To this problem, my answer is positive: Yes, *the assumption of the truth of test statements sometimes allows us to justify the claim that an explanatory universal theory is false.* [3]

A false test statement, thanks to the *modus tollens* rule of inference, reveals the falsity of the universal theory. However, his use of the word ""justified"" needs to be rejected. Popper was so close, yet so far. But that's for a future post. Instead, I'll give induction the strongest defense I can by covering the most common proposed solutions to the problem of induction.

-----------------------

**I.** The naive solution is to *posit a uniformity of nature*. That is, assert a priori that the future will be like the past. This looks like a perfectly valid solution. However, this argument employs the very inference we're trying to justify: on all previous occasions the future has resembled the past. Therefore, the future will always resemble the past. Statements about the present and past are predictive statements about the future if nature is uniform in respect to this scientific theory, but scientists do not know whether or not nature is uniform in respect to this scientific theory. 

This solution moves the problem of induction 'one step back'. Since the principle of induction is not synthetic, and since there remains no method of producing predictions from past evidence that will guarantee their truth, inductive *use* or *success* justifies induction. This leads directly to an infinite regress through further and further principles of induction.

&lt;Where did all the funny bacon references go? I'm narwhaling to bacon an upvote  — I mean, I'm going to make a BLT.&gt;

**II.** A second solution is to retreat to assigning a probability about future events. Inductive inferences don't always work, but they're very likely to lead to true conclusions. ""All x are y"" should be replaced with ""Probably, all x are y"".This leads to the tens of thousands of modern forms of Bayesianism. &lt;Hold on a minute. Did I just hear someone say 'bacon'? No? Back to the BLT again.&gt; 

First, it must be understood that universal statements refer to an open class of instances: it covers an *infinite* number of possible cases. No matter the finite number of inductive inferences collected, such as the statement ""all bacon that up to this time have been observed are crispy"" &lt;Haha! I *knew* you'd say bacon! I'll take a second layer right here on top of the tomato, please.&gt;, the universal statement will always have a greater logical content.

Even if it was valid to retreat to probability, reasoning from a finite number of observed cases would lead to a zero probability of universal statements. Increasing the content of a theory *decreases* its probability: due to the infinite number of test cases, a universal statement is far less probable than any finite number of existential statements. 

If we were to weaken inductive inference to the point where induction gives only ""Probably, the next x will be y"", Hume's argument still stands. For instance, if Popper's formulation of the problem of induction were instead ""Can the claim that a [predictive statement] is true be justified by 'empirical reasons'; that is, by assuming the truth of certain test statements or observation statements (which, it may be said, are 'based on experience')?"", again the answer is 'No'; Hume's problem of induction is not restricted to conclusions about the truth of predictions, nor is it restricted to universal statements. As demonstrated previously, the real power of Hume's argument is that *it extends to any claim that transcends present experience*.

**III.** A third solution is to give up on inductive inference while still agreeing with Hume's skeptical conclusion: we cannot have knowledge of general laws the same way as in a priori disciplines, thus we can have no knowledge of any general laws. This was detailed previously in [Why I Am A Critical Rationalist, Part I](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/ahyzo/why_i_am_a_critical_rationalist_part_i/). The problem of induction is in fact a speical case of the general *problem of justification*. Any attempt to give a sufficient reason to justify a statement or value judgement leads us for logical reasons into a trilemma that Sextus Empiricus saw thousands of years ago.

If we *dogmatically* break off the justification, all foundationalist systems as put forward by Kuhn, Wittgenstein and Carnap leads to the hermeneutic tradition of Habermas, Derrida, Foucault, &amp;c.

'Reality' is only accessible to us in terms of how we understand and interpret it. If there is no foundation to construct a system of knowledge,then  the best we can do is the therapeutic task of 'deconstructing' our purported systems of knowledge by showing the arbitrary interpretations upon they are based.

As part of the evaluation process for allowing his cadets to participate in the study, the president of Norwich University learned T.M. a year or two before the study started, and the preliminary results inspired him to write an op-ed in politico.com and to narrate a publicity-generating video for the David Lynch Foundation:

.

To my layman's eye, the methodology of the study described in the first video appears sound, but I'm not a professional. Assuming the study is sound, does the T.M. practice of the commissioner of the study (the president of the university) as well as the participation of one prominent researcher affiliated with the T.M. organization (Grosswald), invalidate the study? Note: I don't know if any of the other researchers practice TM or not.

.


All the recent independent meta-analysis that conclude that no existing research on meditation (especially on T.M.) is acceptable would eliminate the above study because of the affiliations and lack of blinding of the subjects. Do /reddit readers agree or disagree with this general attitude that such research is automatically tainted and not worthy of consideration?  Do /reddit readers agree or disagree with applying the meta-analysis criteria to the above study?

.

warning: if you disagree then you are invalidating the consensus of the scientific community that T.M. has no real effect beyond relaxation or other meditation practices, since that consensus can only be supported by accepting the meta-analysis criteria I mention above because there are numerous similar studies on T.M. that the current crop of meta-analyses reject due to the above issues that, if included, would put T.M. solidly in front on nearly every measure:

Are they words with competing definitions in the field of philosophy of science, or it's just that people keep confusing these concepts?

For example, people compare ""theory of evolution"" with ""theory of gravity"", usually implying that it's common knowledge that gravity is real, so evolution can be just as real. But, to me, a ""theory of gravity"" means an answer to a ""how come"" question, not merely a description of a phenomenon - and these theories is not so everyday. So, I would differentiate between:

* *Fact* (a trusted observation): a specific object fell toward Earth.
* *Law of gravity* (a generalisation formed from a set of facts): physical bodies attract each other with a force proportional to their mass.
* *Theory of gravity* (an explanation of specific facts and laws): general theory of relativity.

Someone may say that there is a ""Newton's Theory of Gravity"", because it explains how planets move. I would agree, but also propose that a more appropriate name would be something like ""Newton's Gravitational Theory of Celestial Mechanics"", because the phrase ""theory of X"" should carry a meaning of ""explanation of X"". Therefore, Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation and Newton's Gravitational Theory of Celestial Mechanics would be two connected but distinct constructs.

When the inflationary stage of expansion first slows to a more mundane rate, a ridiculously, mind-numbingly vast quantity of energy is released, huge quantities of which immediately begin condensing into matter.  Initially that matter is just a frothing soup of hot particles zipping around, bouncing off each other -- sometimes 'annihilating,' new particles continuously being 'created' to take their place.  It's basically chaos^infinity.

As the universe continues to expand, however, it cools and doesn't have enough energy to continue creating new particles.  As it cools further, those particles don't have enough energy maintain the intensely chaotic nature of their interaction.

First, all the free quarks either annihilate or combine into protons and neutrons.  Then, for a brief time, protons and neutrons begin combining into deuterium and helium nuclei, along with a smattering of other light elements.

Eventually, as the universe continues to expand and cool, free electrons combine with these free nuclei and form stable atoms.  The diffuse gas of these stable atoms goes on to condense gravitationally to form stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, superclusters of clusters...

And through it all, within these stars temperatures become high enough to reignite fusion processes, creating heavy elements in the process.  Because of this, future generations of stars form orbited by planetary systems containing solid, rocky planets.

The presence of those rocky planets, asteroids, etc. offered a gravitational stage where various elements could come together to form complex, highly ordered electronic systems.  In at least one instance, and likely more, this resulted in the development of an organic chemistry so complex that life as we define it emerged and evolved into increasingly complex molecular structures, systems of molecular structures, cells, multicellular organisms, collectives of multicellular organisms, and on and on.

Despite all this, one of the fundamental laws of physics is the second law of thermodynamics -- the law of increasing entropy.  Any spontaneous, naturally occurring process, it says, will tend to increase the overall disorder of the universe.  As far as we know, this law holds.  This evolutionary progression I've outlined cannot have violated it: all of the individual processes must have somehow increase the overall disorder.

Yet, from the broadest perspective, this has occurred through stages which always seem to create more and more highly ordered states and systems of states and complexly organized systems of subsystems.  Every overall stage seems, counter intuitively, to increase order in some way, rather than decrease it.

Thoughts from a clueless foreigner. ,24,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/c4xdd/science_as_a_foreign_language_and_quines/,"*Originally posted in [.r/PhilosophyofScience](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience).*

A thought struck me while I was in a [restaurant in Budapest](http://www.gerloczy.hu/) feeling like a complete tourist. I had ordered a stick of bread and the (non-English speaking) waiter later came to tell me something about ""half"". I wasn't sure what he meant. They only have half sticks left? They are half price? They're closing in half an hour? For a brief period we gesticulated and tried to explain ourselves in our own languages to no avail. How can I ever be sure what he means if his explanations can only be achieved by using other words that are equally uncertain to my ears? How can meaning ever truly be pinned down without a qualified translator?

The highly influential 20th Century philosopher of science and logician [Williard Van Orman Quine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine) discussed this in his **[indeterminacy of translation thesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminacy_of_translation)** of languages in his book [Word and Object](http://www.angelfire.com/md2/timewarp/quine.html). This extract from the wikipedia page captures it well :

&gt; Consider Quine's example of the word ""gavagai"" uttered by a native upon seeing a rabbit. The linguist could do what seems natural and translate this as ""Lo, a rabbit."" But other translations would be compatible with all the evidence he has: ""Lo, food""; ""Let's go hunting""; ""There will be a storm tonight"" (these natives may be superstitious); ""Lo, a momentary rabbit-stage""; ""Lo, an undetached rabbit-part."" Some of these might become less likely – that is, become more unwieldy hypotheses – in the light of subsequent observation. Others can only be ruled out by querying the natives: An affirmative answer to ""Is this the same gavagai as that earlier one?"" will rule out ""momentary rabbit stage,"" and so forth. But these questions can only be asked once the linguist has mastered much of the natives' grammar and abstract vocabulary; that in turn can only be done on the basis of hypotheses derived from simpler, observation-connected bits of language; and those sentences, on their own, admit of multiple interpretations, as we have seen.

(Sounds like Quine was a heck gavagai no? :P)

At this time I started to understand more clearly what Quine was on about in his famous [Two Dogmas of Empiricism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Dogmas_of_Empiricism) paper when he was attacking both the notions of [verificationism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verificationism) and [falsificationism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Falsificationism). The laws of nature are like the grammar and vocab of a foreign language. When we try to pin down the truth of some law of nature by experiment, we make so many background assumptions about the experiment and the grammar that, for the purpose of establishing truth, require experimentation themselves. If I test a substance for the presence of gold, am I sure my equipment is working? Am I sure there the test isn't affected by the magnet that is in the next room? Am I sure some daily solar event has no influence? Remember the [loss of the scurvy cure](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/bazh0/in_the_second_half_of_the_nineteenth_century_the/)? They had made an erroneous background assumption that lemons and limes had the same curative properties. 

Here is what Quine says in Two Dogmas :
&gt; The totality of our so-called knowledge or beliefs… is a man-made fabric which impinges on experiences only along the edges… A conflict with experience at the periphery occasions readjustments over some of our statements. Reevaluations of some statements entails reevaluation of others, because of their logical interconnections -- the logical laws being in turn simply certain further statements of the system, certain further elements of the field… But the total field is so underdetermined by its boundary conditions, experience, that there is much latitude of choice as to what statements to reevaluate in the light of any single contrary experience

So basically no experiment will definitively validate or falsify a hypothesis - we can always adjust our other background beliefs to accommodate.

So what do people think of Quine's explanation of science as a hidden language? (Some might be tempted to say the 
language of the god/s?) Are we bound to be naive foreigners who can find their way around but never understand the familial nuances of the scientific language?

---

End note: By the way, why are translation programs still so crappy? I sincerely hope our current scientific understanding is better than a [Babelfish](http://babelfish.yahoo.com/) translation of reality.

&gt; How can observation be systematically integrated into knowledge?

I very much encourage you to find the time to carefully read [this long article](http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes) on Bayes' theorem. The author attempts to fully explain the (simple) math behind the theorem, and *what it represents*. He will later introduce the concept of evidence (it's measured in decibels!) and explain the relation to scientific methodology near the end. Here's a short (compared to the article) quote:

&gt; Similarly, Popper's dictum that an idea must be falsifiable can be interpreted as a manifestation of the Bayesian conservation-of-probability rule; if a result X is positive evidence for the theory, then the result ~X would have disconfirmed the theory to some extent.  If you try to interpret both X and ~X as ""confirming"" the theory, the Bayesian rules say this is impossible!  To increase the probability of a theory you must expose it to tests that can potentially decrease its probability; this is not just a rule for detecting would-be cheaters in the social process of science, but a consequence of Bayesian probability theory.  On the other hand, Popper's idea that there is only falsification and no such thing as confirmation turns out to be incorrect.  Bayes' Theorem shows that falsification is very strong evidence compared to confirmation, but falsification is still probabilistic in nature; it is not governed by fundamentally different rules from confirmation, as Popper argued.

Did I mention how long the article was? But it's worth it. To spark your interest, I will list a few cases of applied Bayesian inference in other domains:

* Engineering: Debugging.
* Medicine: Diagnostic process (special case of debugging).

Best-selling, (somewhat haughty) hardcore scientific anti-realism.",26,1,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/ajckd/nassim_taleb_and_the_black_swan_bestselling/,"[Nassim Taleb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) is the best-selling author of [The Black Swan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan_\(Taleb_book\)). He is a former Wall Street trader and a current University Professor of risk engineering whose grandfather and great-grandfather were former deputy prime ministers of Lebanon.

Taleb describes himself as a skeptical empiricist. Philosophers of science would probably describe him as an extreme [scientific anti-realist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-realism). He attacks modern intellectuals for what he calls their platonicity - a tendency to create underlying pictures of reality that go well beyond the data. His gripe is primarily with the social sciences, historical studies, the media and every day thinking. He is particularly savage towards finance, attacking Nobel Prize winners such as [Robert C Merton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Merton) (including to his face) for devising and promoting economic models which assume that market price movements behave in a log-normal fashion. It is the widespread belief in these models which he believes are the cause of financial market crashes.

The problem is, he says, we inhabit two worlds of probability which are often confused. He labels these two worlds - mediocristan and extremistan. Mediocristan governs much of the human physical world - it can be described neatly by the [Gaussian (bell) curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) where no single observation can affect the properties of a large sample much - height, weight, IQ, mortality rates. Extremistan describes the more random nature of human constructions and some natural processes - wealth, book sales, inflation, deaths from terrorist incidents, population of cities, size of planets. Western intellectuals have tried to fit normal curves to Extremistan processes. 

His book is frequently punctuated by descriptions of common fallacies, some of which I list below.

*[Ludic fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludic_fallacy) : Trying to fit probability distributions to data without enough information and reasoning based on these false assumptions. Sometimes we have to reason without even knowing anything about the underlying distribution.*

*[Problem of silent evidence (better known as survivorship bias)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias): Deriving causality from an analysis of the winners e.g. assessing the traits (such as risk-tasking appetite) in common of millionaires to explain their success without examining the many more people with those same traits that failed to be millionaires.*

*[Narrative fallacy](http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/abdallah/2009/0209.html): Fitting a story or pattern to a series of facts such as what happens in historical explanation and ignoring the many counterfactuals.*

For a video lecture detailing his thoughts in The Black Swan, [see here](http://fora.tv/2008/02/04/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb_A_Crazier_Future) (thanks to rjefferson). His (rather unconventional) website can be found [here](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com). Long podcast interviews with Taleb about the financial crisis found [here](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/_featuring/nassim_taleb/). One of his great heroes is [Benoit Mandelbrot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoît_Mandelbrot).

Taleb's influence has been substantial. He is credited with predicting the present financial crisis (and profitting from it substantially as a result). He recently [testified in Congress](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X7pNFbGjz0). He draws crowds that have Bill Gates and Michael Dell waiting in line. At times he is a pompous and haughty read - unquestionably controversial - but as of 2009, he is probably the most influential and widely read philosopher of science alive.

Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/x1kcw/alan_watts_on_scientific_naturalism/  

This is an excerpt from ""The Way of Zen"" (Vintage, p. 12): [his emphasis, not mine]  

&gt; Biology and physiology, for example, are types of knowledge which represent the real world in terms of their own special abstract categories. They measure and classify that world in ways appropriate to the particular uses they want to make of it, somewhat as a surveyor deals with earth in terms of acres, a contractor in truckloads or tons, and a soil analyst in types of chemical structures. To say that the concrete reality of the human organism *is* physiological is like saying that the earth is so many tons or acres. And to say that this reality is natural is accurate enough if we mean spontaneous (*tzu-jan*) or *natura naturans* (“nature naturing”). But it is quite inaccurate if we mean *natura naturata* (“nature natured”), that is to say, nature classified, sorted into “natures” as when we ask, “What is the *nature* of this thing?” It is in this sense of the word that we must think of “scientific naturalism,” a doctrine which has nothing in common with the naturalism of Taoism.  

This is slightly out of context, but I suppose his argument would apply as well in the debate whether or not materialism corresponds to reality. The play on words is typical Watts, but I think this is exactly part of his argument: that natural sciences employ languages that are often confused with the phenomena they should represent, thus leaving no room for other types of knowledge.

I would have been inclined to be clinical about something like that but, as always, I'm battling myself about the appropriate level of respect to the dead in light of what they where, alive.

I run into conflict with my own philosophies about mortality, like; *""When I am dead I will no longer have the capacity to care about being dead, much less anything else, therefor it is redundant to care about my death beyond trying to prolong my life.""* which devalues the importance of death to the point where my corpse is just a piece of meat, and other philosophies such as those which seek to value the death of others by the loss that is the potential of good that a person could have otherwise had in life.

This relates because in signing your organs away for scientific research, you're allowing people to do just about anything to your organs for scientific purposes. One can be clinical while researching, but what about things that fall outside of research that don't damage the organ? It would be unprofessional in a lab to wear a brain like a hat and pretend you're Davey Crockett but what about when you're doing an educational presentation? Is instigating laughter important enough to offset the irreverence? SHOULD we even consider the organ a portion of our social dept to the person that was once alive? Or perhaps we should value, instead, the altruisms of the person of when they were alive?
