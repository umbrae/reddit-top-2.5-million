About 10 years ago my best friend called me up. He'd graduated from an expensive private school with ~$100k in student loan debt, and had been admitted to law school at the same place. Turned out he was having a wee bit of trouble financing it. He wanted to know if I'd co-sign on a law school loan or two.

At the time, I didn't even know what that meant (I got through college with no debt, thank the Old Gods). Called up my dad who strenuously advised me to under NO circumstances co-sign on anyone else's loan, ever. So I told my buddy sorry, but no. 

Unfortunately, our friendship was never the same after that. I'm sure he resented me for not being a true bud and signing. But somehow or other he managed to get financing for God knows how many more tens of thousands in loans for law school.

Fast forward 10 years. Found out recently that, like many with law degrees in the current economy, his income hasn't kept pace with his loans, and he's defaulted on his student loans and the debt collectors are pounding on his door, taking his car, garnishing wages, taking out liens, etc. 

And if I had agreed to co-sign those years ago, those debt collectors would be coming after **me**. 

Thank the Old Gods for my dad's wise advice, and the lesson is: never, ever co-sign. Ever.  

EDIT: Interesting minority of folks here chiming in to say they co-signed X loan with no problems. Some get lucky, I guess. Also, I suppose that in a **very** few limited number of situations - parents helping children - co-signing *might* make sense. I still wouldn't do it if it could at all be avoided, though.

EDIT 2: So many horror stories. Anyone considering co-signing a loan should be required to read through these comments first. ",,False,,t5_2qstm,1369950290.0,,,True,t3_1fc6dm,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1fc6dm/never_ever_cosign_a_loan/,

Long story short: I am $240000 in debt for my undergrad. I made some horrible decisions and choices, and am through trying to justify them and convincing myself that its not my fault. 

I completed a 5-Year Business degree at a university that is known only for their Engineering program. It is, more or less, renowned for being one of the most expensive schools at the worst value. I paid book price for it. 

I graduated 2 years ago and bounced around jobs ever since. I landed in a government agency with little-to-no upward mobility. I am still seeking a higher paying job with the fleeting hope that some day I may be able to pay this thing off.  

90%+ of this debt is privately held, and co-signed by my parents. All of my deferment has expired, and none are eligible for income based repayment. I have made only a couple ""good faith payments"" at the request of my mother.  It is all in default, and I ignore 15+ collection calls per day.  I

I'd rather this not become a conversation about my horrible choices to accrue this debt, but a discussion to perhaps resolve the situation. I have posted this several times in other subreddits seeking the latter, but only got the former.

Not everyone is the same! Not everyone lives the same life that you do. They don't have the same goals; the same interests. Not everyone cares about saving 15%+ for their retirement at age 23. Not everyone wants that advice. They came here for a reason, and it wasn't to get lectured. This subreddit gives hundreds of opportunities to give advice catered to an individuals needs. You have the chance of really clearing out some of the confusion that they have in their lives. Instead, they are met with the same cookie-cutter answers that are of no help to anyone, especially the OP. I'll be the first to admit that I sometimes do the same thing, but I'm definitely trying to get it out of my system (both on here and in real life).

My point is that not everyone cares about saving $57 over the course of 2 years by paying the highest interest loan off before the others. Not everyone cares that their car in hemorrhaging money. Not everyone is willing to cut cable, get a prepaid phone, and take the bus to work to free up $200/mo. That's 100% their choice! Sure, you can give them the option they come here asking for help on their budget, but it definitely doesn't need to be in the majority of the threads. 

The most recent example that led me to this post:

* [Refinancing car? Also student loan questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/180ueo/refinancing_car_also_student_loan_questions/)   

He has a couple pretty simple questions about refinancing and his student loan situation. A simple, ""Yes, it is a good idea to refinance as long as there aren't a lot of hidden fees involved. Blah, blah, student loans, blah.""  Maybe throw in something about maybe trading the car for something else.

What does he get? Bombarded with comments that offer nothing more than to criticize him buying a car. He gets almost no help with the questions that he actually had. Who are we to tell someone how to live their lives? His car may be the only thing that he enjoys to do. He spends $600 a month on it, big deal. A lot of people waste a helluva lot more than that and have absolutely nothing to show for it. At least he has a car... 

This was just the most recent one, there are plenty of others even just on the front page.

Total brag and some advice for you younger folks.",1035,310,519,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1doopt/at_35_my_401k_just_hit401k_total_brag_and_some/,"Okay, my 401(k) hit $401K in terms of money in there.  I am totally bragging, because, fuck, I find it funny and awesome at the same time.  Now I'm done bragging - I jut wanted to give some advice for you out there:

* Just automatically give the max.  I started in 2000.  My salary was $62,000.  The max you could contribute then was $10,500 (I think).  So, I never considered myself having a salary of $62,000.  It was a salary of $51,500.  Note though that if you are in a low tax state or in a low tax bracket, a 401(K) Roth may be a better answer.

* Be aggressive but diverse.  For the first 10 years, I invested half in large caps- an S&amp;P 500 Index that didn't do too well, and the rest in a small cap fund to balance it out. The small cap actually rode the early 2000's recession really well, and after 10 years, it was 60% of my portfolio.  When my company got acquired, I later switched to an even more diverse portfolio, with more emerging stocks, world stocks, Russell indexes, etc.  Basically 5 indexes instead of 2.

* Take advantage of company matching.  This is a no-brainer.

* And here is the most important thing - Don't listen to loser poor people!  Loser poor people are people who maintain a poor mentality that will keep them perpetually poor.  Not to be confused with broke people, who may temporarily be out of money (as I was once in a while)  Yes, there will be some fucker who think the world is going to end, that this latest recession is the downfall of American society.  I'm 35 - and I've heard it all from the loser poor people.  In the early 90s recession, the Japanese were going to buy us out and we would all be slaves to them, Mexicans would take ALL the jobs, and Generation X was full of slackers would be the first generation that is poorer than their parents.  Then, in the early 2000s, terrorists would create a world where we could all die, and the Chinese would own us all.  Then there is this recession, where America will magically fall apart again, and this time, Generation Y was full of entitled losers who would be the first generation that is poorer than their parents.  These people are the ones, even though made a similar salary to me with similar experience, have maybe 1/10th the wealth, but 20 times the confidence that they are always right.

* Trust in the economy.  I mean do the math.  Personally, I contributed, what, $160K from my pocket - but it is now worth $401(K).  And since January 2000, when I started, the S&amp;P is up, what, 8%?  How does that work?  Well, company matching, which average around $4K a year helped boost it.  But obviously that is not enough.  As mentioned earlier - I was aggressive and constantly investing.  During the two recessions that I went through, the market went down, and dollar cost averaging in aggressive stocks helped tremendously.  I didn't panic, I didn't withdraw, I stuck to the long, drawn out plan.  Fuck, I think in March 2009, my 401(K) was something like $150(K).  Down from $250(K) just a year and a half ago.  But that didn't matter - cause this is the long haul.  

So - hopefully some 22 year old is reading this and in 13 years, like me, will already be set for retirement.

EDIT:

So this has been great post - and I hope I got everyone thinking about the future by showing that continued contributions, even in a flat, ""lost"" decade that we just had - through two major recessions - can contribute significant growth.  I know there's always these assumptions about getting rich that are based on 12% continuous return on investment from many books and advisors.  I wanted to show that even in times like these, that is not the case.  

I was 22, broke, and in debt with a bit of school loans when I first started.  Like a lot of people here.  Now, unlike me, you guys will probably not go through a lost decade, and I'm pretty damn confident that when you turn 35, a few of you will be worth way more (even inflation adjusted) than I am at age 35.  

I'm sure I will see many of you years later in our retirement homes in tropical wonderlands.

And to those Negative Nellies out there.  Excuses are easy.  It's easy to say, ""well, I don't make as much, so I'm not going to save!""  Or, the ""stock market boom is over and I am going to lose everything"".  Or ""I got lucky"".  These are the Loser Poor People I was talking about.  You can be broke, and you can set off to accumulate wealth, or you can be like these guys not just be broke, but be poor.  Make special note of these people - cause hanging out with these people, listening to them, will cause you to be poor.  The ones that start off with an insult, and then claim to know more than the rest of us are great at masking their own deficiencies.  Fuck - my dad was one of these Loser Poor People - he made a good salary for 30 years, and for most of his life, had almost nothing to show for it.  

If you are broke, and want to be poor - listen to them.  If you are broke, and want to do better, listen to ALL the success stories out there, and learn and adapt to your own circumstances.

I started a throwaway account because I'd like to share a little bit more personal detail about my situation.  Here it goes:

29 years old.  Married.  Two kids born in '08 and '10.  Graduated in 2011 in Construction Management with $27k in student loans.  I was working in an internship that rolled into a full-time job at $45k/year after I graduated.  

My wife and I both fell into the trap of thinking ""We deserve some sort of reward for all the hard work we've done"" and went out and got two cars totaling $20k in loans.

A few months later we saw the light after sitting down and putting a budget together to see when we could realistically have a good down payment for a home.  We were saving ~$300 while making the minimum payments on all of our debt.  A down payment seemed impossibly far away.

One thing led to another and over the next 19-20 months we sold both cars and replaced them with a beater that I bought for $1 from my father-in-law, and a $3000 car that we bought from my wife's grandmother.

After a year at my job I got a promotion and a raise to $55k/year and by then we were aggressively paying off our debt.  Just this past March I got another raise to $62k/year and a $6k bonus that helped push us to make our last lump sum payment towards our [student loan debt](http://i.imgur.com/AVDk6Ql.jpg). 

What I'm actually most proud of is that we've cut our monthly expenses down from ~$3200/mo to $2100/mo while our income has increased dramatically.

We're now saving ~$1800/mo towards an emergency fund and a down payment on a house as our two bedroom/two bath apartment is feeling a little small as our kids get older (and bigger).

Sorry for the wall o' text.  Like I sad at the beginning, I hope my experience can help and inspire someone else to keep pushing.

I noticed that my Wells Fargo credit card had monthly charges for ""Credit Defense."" Upon Googling what that was, I found that many people online complained about getting these unwanted charges, and that Wells Fargo repeatedly charges people for it without their permission. 

I found the page on the bank's website for the [plan](https://www.wellsfargo.com/credit_cards/services/protect/defense), which is supposed to erase your debt when you die and pay you in the event of hospitalization or car repairs, etc. Of course I've never received any of these benefits even when I qualified, because *I didn't know about the program*. After reading the description, I knew I never would have willingly signed up for such a thing.

I called WF and explained my situation, asking for a refund. The first person I spoke to said he could cancel the plan and that he had the authority to refund me about $160, though the charges since 2006 totalled $1678.45. I asked to speak to someone with more authority, but he told me if I wanted a full refund he would send a dispute form on my behalf. If they found evidence that I had signed up, they would show it to me. Otherwise, I should be eligible for a refund.

I expected this to go nowhere. Most of the discussion I'd seen on the internet said WF ignored them and kept charging them for the protection plan. But almost 2 weeks after the phone call, I saw the $1678 credit to my account! That was this morning, and I'm so happy!

Tips to avoid Lifestyle Inflation:


Pay Yourself First:

Set an automatic amount to come off your paycheck directly into a savings account. Use this money for an emergency fund, down payment on a house, buying a car with cash, or early financial independence. Start with a simple budget and learn how to control your expenses. You’d be surprised how a few $’s here and there add up to over +10% of your net income. Aim for a 20-25% savings rate at first and increase that over time with future raises.


Bank those Salary Increases:

Put a large portion of any salary increase automatically into your savings account. Putting away 75% of your net increase is a good guide. Leave yourself with 25% as a reward for your hard work but put the rest into savings each month. This will help you increase your savings rate from 25% to 50-60% over time.


Choose Friends Wisely:

It’s not hard to spend $150 on a fun night out at the bars, but it’s also not hard to spend $20 and have the same amount of fun. The difference is who you’re with and where you go. Friends whose social pressure causes you to spend more will cost you dearly, both in the short term and in the long term. Focus on friends who value relationships over material possessions and flashy spending.


Pick the right Status Symbols:

Status symbols are easy ways to waste money. Typical status symbols include a fancy car, designer clothes, expensive meals/bar tabs, high tech toys etc. Purchasing these items typically result two negative effects. Number one, they suck up a lot of your disposable income. Number two they result in a form of self-segmentation, you’ll find yourself in a new high spending social group who values this type of consumer lifestyle. Less expensive status symbols include personal health/fitness, life experiences, travel and your personal attitude, optimism and confidence. These things also affect your social status but are far less expensive. These social groups also put less value on money and consumption.


Buy things Slightly Used:

One of the great things about lifestyle inflation is that everyone else is doing it! Take advantage and get great items for a fraction of the cost by buying slightly used from Craigslist. Decide on what you need and start browsing Craigslist periodically. Guaranteed, you’ll find exactly what you need and it will cost you pennies on the dollar.


Invest in Quality:

No one said you can’t spend your hard earned money, just make sure you invest in quality items, not impulse buys. As a general rule of thumb you should spend 1hr on research for every $100 spent. Need a new bed? Invest in one that is high quality and will last for +10yrs and provide a restful sleep. Spending $2000 on a high quality bed means at least 20hrs of research. This rule will help you avoid impulse purchases and instead make high quality consumer investments that will definitely outlast cheaper items.",,False,,t5_2qstm,1371172043.0,,,True,t3_1ga7hv,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ga7hv/tips_for_college_graduates_avoid_lifestyle/,

I update it once it a quarter, and doing so today, discovered that I have crossed the one million dollar mark!

I know $1M isn't the same as it used to be, but it's a goal I set 10+ years ago for myself, so it's nice to finally reach it.  Nor was this overnight.  It's been a long, slow grind.  

I didn't come from money.  Quite the opposite, as only one parent graduated high school and we sometimes lived paycheck to paycheck.  (I remember a few drives with my mom to pay the electrify bill &amp; get the lights turned back on.)  I graduated college with &gt;60-70k in debt.  (I'm older than the typical redditor -- in today's dollars, adjusted for inflation, it would be ~90k.)

I've learned a lot about money the hard way and a made lot of mistakes over the years.  But I stuck with it, and figured each time, it was simply the price of learning each lesson.  One of the great things is that I'll be able to pass those lessons on to my kids (hopefully).

I also find that I'm motivated by others success stories, so I thought I'd share mine.  

Even if you're in the hole, hang in there.  You may not get rich over night, but with persistance, you'll get there!

Now, as for me,  I'm on to $2M.  I sure hope it's easier.

EDIT:  Apologies to the people I've offended.  My intention wasn't to brag.  I'm currently trying to lose ~30 pounds &amp; every time someone posts on /r/loseit the progress they've made, I find it encouraging.  If they can do it, I can too!   That was my intent in sharing.  I'm willing to answer most questions people have (as I've tried to below).  Like weight loss, the ideas aren't particularly magical.  You need a plan &amp; have to stick to it.

The people I work with are nice and good people but the cost of living in the area is too high compared to what my company pays.

Those higher up get paid well but lower employees that do a lot of work for the higher up don't get recognized. I have my annual review coming up and although I've accomplished a lot in the past year, I'm not expecting much because of a minimal raise last year.

This year, I decided to learn more about my money and where it was going. After learning about wasteful front-loading fees and the high costs of keeling the advisor each year from this forum and Vanguard, I decided to make some changes.  

I asked my ""advisor"" to evaluate my account and recommend a new allocation.  She came back with some recommendations that looked fine on paper for the moneys already in mutual funds.  However, when I asked about he money market cash, she said that any new funds invested into the plan would get hit with the 5.75 percent front load fee.  (That totaled about 700 plus dollars.) 

I wrote back and said ""Oh ok.  Well, I am going to do this in stages.  Let's keep everything in my account the same right now while I research the proposal, but I am going ahead and transferring out the money market cash to Vanguard.  While I understand advisors  need to make money, I cannot in good conscious pay 700 dollars upfront in front load fees when that money could be siting in my account for 30 years.""

I never heard back from her and when I wrote back the other day to say ""Ok...let's go ahead and go with the proposals you sent up for the money already in mutual funds"", I get a message saying essentially: 

""Hi.  Since you mentioned moving money out and I didn't hear back from you on the proposals, your account has been transferred to our home office in St Louis. You should have gotten a letter about a week ago. Here is a number.""  (It is essentially a all center I believe, the same thing I'd get at Vanguard.) 

I just wrote them back because I am PISSED.  

I said: ""Okaaaaaaaaay…..I *did* say I was going to be doing this in stages and that I was interested in the funds you listed etc, but I just needed some time to look into it.  I'm not sure how that translates into ""Well, let's dump this guy on another team because he doesn't want to pay front load fees on new monies invested."" 

After 13 years they transfer me to a call center?! I also just asked them in my email ""Have my yearly fees been reduced or am I paying the same thing as I am for your group's personal attention?""  

I'll be interested in their response.  Anyway, I do believe now I am transferring EVERYTHING out of there and into vanguard because I'm so mad and I really feel slighted. They could have just sat there on my account and collected the yearly 100 dollars from me, but they couldn't even be bothered to do THAT...they just shuffled me away.  

Anyway, this was just a rant to a group I think can appreciate it....thanks for listening.  :( 

**EDIT: It's done.  After calling the new wells fargo group I've been transferred to and realizing everything was the same fee wise, I said thank you and got off the phone.  I immediately called vanguard and transferred EVERYTHING over.  :)  Feelsgoodman.jpg**

**EDIT 2: After having read some of the responses in this thread, I see the basic issue is this: They weren't making money off me, so they transferred me...that's it. It doesn't matter long I've been with them.  I suppose at the end of the day, that's really all there is to it.  The truth is, after becoming wary of fees, a relationship like this benefits neither of us and it is best to part ways.

For a more comprehensive retirement spreadsheet, please [**check out this one**](http://calcitout.com/2012/12/forecasting-by-year/) posted by /u/mvnman. He did not make it, but was kind enough to share the link with us. It's incredibly detailed.

_____

*As someone pointed out, the font is kinda big. I didn't realize that I was editing it at 85% zoom, hence why it's so big when you open it at 100%. I would recommend zooming out a bit (use the slider at the bottom right or Ctrl + Scrollwheel Down).*

*Also, don't miss the Car Loan Amortization schedule sheet at the bottom. It's currently only for 60 month loans, but if yours is longer, just highlight the bottom row and stretch it down from the bottom left corner. It'll fill in the formulas for you.*

_____

The state, county, medicare, social security, and federal tax percentages in the upper left are specific to my locale and salary --  I would recommend using one of your pay stubs to get the right federal percentage for your salary. I just didn't want to have to figure out the huge formula for federal withholding.

_____

The **Benefits** section is bi-weekly. Not monthly.
_____

**As it says at the top, ONLY EDIT INFORMATION IN PINK CELLS.** Everything else will calculate for you automagically. (You can actually edit anything on the sheet if you want to...but it's full of formulas, so I wouldn't want you to mess things up for yourself. Just be careful!)

_____

You **can** edit Renter's Insurance, even though it's in the blue section. This amount is *not* split between roommates.
_____

The box for pay bonuses is specific to my particular bonus distribution formula at work. Feel free to customize this to yours if you get an annual bonus. The total gets put into the ""Credits"" table right above it. This is where you'll find the bonus formula.

_____

Feel free to add your own expenses (or delete current rows) to the Expense Type table. I left a bunch of blanks for you guys...the formulas are already linked to the cells, so just edit the Expense Type and Monthly Payment.

_____

The retirement estimates in the center of the spreadsheet are based on a 10% lifetime return. To change this, just edit the ""Estimated Retirement Acct. Return"" percentage.

_____

Keep in mind that this assumes you always contribute the same amount, and you always remain on the same salary. This is obviously not the case, but you can at least see where you’re headed. If we’re lucky (we as in other 20-somethings...I'm 23), we’ll receive about 70% of our SS contributions by the time we retire. This has been taken into account in the **Retirement Estimates** section.

_____

Lastly, Roth IRA and 401k have contribution caps per year. The max you can contribute to your 401k is $17.5k, and the max you can contribute to a Roth IRA is $5.5k. Keep this in mind when you’re playing with the percentages. The row called 401k Contribution is your personal contribution…the row called **401k Contribution + Match** is **Your contribution + Your company's match**. Don’t get these confused. The **New Net Pay** is the money left over after taxes and 401k/Roth/ESPP contributions, but does NOT subtract out for the company match – it doesn’t because it’s free money! WOO!

If you have other IRAs or retirement accounts, just add/edit accordingly. PM me if you need help!

For years I carried around a maxed credit card of 25k! How awful that feeling was. Sleepless nights, stress, worry, and my self esteem took a big hit. A year ago my wife left me, and I decided to make a change about who I am: physically, emotionally, spiritually and financially. I stumbled across Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University, and took to it. I started the class in May of last year, and you can see the affect it had on my debt in the attached graph. http://imgur.com/fKa66iV

And though I stick to the steps Dave Ramsey laid out for getting out of debt, it's my daily visit to /r/personalfinance that kept me excited and motivated! Now I'm looking forward to building my emergency fund, and investing. What a wonderful foundation this is to start out this next stage of my life. Thank you, all! This is a wonderful community!

**Biggest lessons I've learned:**

*Have a good offense*. I switched jobs and got a pay increase of about ~~250%~~ 150% (i can't math). I went from 35k to 85k. Due to some hard times, I had to accept a job as a graphic designer paying 35k while I tried to sort out my marriage. I'm now an Art Director in the video game industry making 85k in the Southern California area.

*Have a good defense*. I made my budget and I stuck to it. Overall I placed around 60% of my take home towards debt. When my budget got a little wonky around September, I switched to the envelope system for food/entertainment. The envelope system works!

*Always be learning*. 'The Total Money Makeover' was my first financial book. Since then I've read 'The Millionaire Next Door' and 'The Boglehead's Guide to Investing'. I see how the knowledge I gain at this moment can drastically change my future for the positive! I'm soaking it up!

The hospital is now sending me the bills saying that I have to pay.

---

My wife and I have stable jobs and live in a very conservative community. We are relatively conservative and simple folks. We have no student loans, no credit card debt, no medical bills... our only real debt is our mortgage and car payment. We never had a car payment until last month and always paid our cars in full but we wanted to sell one of our cars to purchase larger vehicle since we plan to start a family in the next year or two.

**Emergency Fund**
---
My wife was experiencing severe abdominal pain and required an emergency appendectomy (removal of appendix) surgery out of the blue! I have good health insurance through my employer but we are still required to pay a minimum annual deductible (we are relatively healthy and have not paid any of the deductible to this point in the year) and 20% co-insurance.

Long story short, after health insurance and money in my HSA we still owe a decent chunk in medical bills. The emergency fund will take a little hit... but that is the point! I am glad we set aside money in an emergency fund to plan ahead for emergency situations.

I know this post does not provide any advice or information for /r/personalfinance but I just wanted to stress the importance of an Emergency Fund!

**EDIT** 

Let me make a clarifying statement/caveat: I made this thread to offer higher-income households an alternative view of how to think about wealth creation.

First, I know that many of you will disagree with this but let's try to keep the conversation civil. The following involves the purposeful use of exaggerations. 

Second, If you're poor, this isn't going to help you. I'm not going to draw a bright-line rule on what ""poor"" is, but I acknowledge my advice is of limited value. You need money to make money.  


**Conservatism to a fault.** Everyone wants to be conservative, but it's possible to be too prudent and miss out on an great opportunities. We can call this the prudence trap or loss aversion. Simply put, people on here  suffer more anxiety losing $1000 than they would be experience joy making $1000. Let's make one thing clear: this is a mental mistake. Instead, there should be a discussion of risk vs. reward. As a example, I often see this:

OP:  Should I buy a house as an investment property? I have NO experience as a landlord.

Reddit: This is a bad idea. Tenants could be troublesome, maintenance experiences can be higher than you expected. Worst of all, you could one day wake up and see your house 50% underwater! 

Bankster1: Great- thanks for listing the bear case. What about the bull case? What about a base case? Tenants could be great, maintenance expenses could be minimal and the home can appreciate! Is this house being sold below market value? Below replacement costs?  If yes, why would the house continue to lose value? This could be a real winner.  

Since you have no experience, I would look for a wider margin of safety. A 5% cap rate is probably too risky but at 15% you'd be crazy not too! A lot of things would have to go wrong for you not to make money in such a scenario. Saying things like ""you could lose 50% of your equity ""just because it happened in the past is silly.   


**Debt elimination vs. wealth creation.** It seems to be that people on here have a skewed sense of what debt is and what interest is. I think the best way to describe my view would be through an example: I still have ~$15,000 in loans at an average rate of 4.0% and $50K in cash in my bank account earnings 0.1% interest. 1) Most people on here would advise paying it off to ""lock-in"" the return. 2) Others would want to pay if off just to eliminate a ""fixed-cost"" and a 3) few just simply view interest as throwing money away. Each of the example above moves further away from reality. 

1)	Yea, you do lock a return but 4% is a pathetic rate and the optionality I get from having $50K is worth more than 4% to me. You never know when you'll see a great investment opportunity and a focus on minimizing your debt can eliminate your optionality. 

2)	Again, think about what optionality (opportunity cost) the extra cash gives you. If you can invest the money at a 8%-10% return you're making money with other people's money. An 8%-10% cap rate on real estate is pretty realistic is many different parts of the country. Or it's at least enough of a buffer to hire a property manager while you learn the ropes.

3)	Interest is the cost of borrowing. Decomposing the total cost of a mortgage into principal and interest over a 30-year period is comparing apples and oranges since it ignores inflation, opportunity costs, interest rate risk, etc...  


**Lifestyle inflation is not a sin, it's a reward.** I believe that rewarding yourself is a healthy part of life. For instance, I love to go to restaurants and I've dropped $500 on dinner for two more than once. I'm not saying go buy a new BMW (because new cars are often the worst financial decisions someone can make), but to chastise people because they're only saving 20% of their income when they have the potential to save 50% is ridiculous. It's all about balance and no one should confuse responsible personal finance with the goal of minimizing one's living expense. Mr.MoneyMustache says some pretty stupid things about this, imo. Some of the greatest experience in life are free, but more often than not, a great experience comes with a big bill. Sometimes it's worth the expense.  


**Early retirement is the dream!** I want to use this bullet point to expand on the above. I often see someone who just got a new job making ~$100K a year and the first things Redditers advise is ""keep living like you're still earnings $25K and you can retire in 10-years!"" I couldn't disagree more. First of all, this would usually require someone retiring when they're in their peak earning years (or sooner!). Second, I also think it's a waste for a healthy person to retire, especially if they like their job. I think work can be a great way to spend the day. Plus, even if I did retire all my friends and family would still be working. Third, the early retirement math implies no lifestyle inflation. I think it's a bad trade off to commit yourself to continue to live like a college student (which gets boring real quick) just so you can retire early when you're healthy enough and smart enough to continue building your wealth and improving your quality of life.   


**What about others?** No one on here talk about the cost of a friend's wedding or a parent's birthday. I love being able to buy my friends a bottle of Johnny Blue or my dad an iPad. Sure it kills my savings rate for the month but being able to give back feels good.

First of all, I still have siblings that live at home and rely on my parents for everything. What would happen to them if one of my parents had to go to federal prison for X amount of years for tax fraud? Or what would happen to them if my parents were racked with this massive fine? My sibling's lives could literally be ruined. Having a parent in prison has all sorts of consequences. Is my stolen $2,000 really worth all of that if the IRS and state gave me the money back? I do think that there should be more severe consequences for my parents. And I will never give them any trust again. But, it's not worth the risk of hurting the wellbeing of my siblings. However; if this ever happens again, I will press charges. Once is the limit here. I know it might be hard to understand, but it's easy to speak in hypotheticals, it's not as easy to actually act.

We all know that high-interest loans should be paid down first, but beyond that I think many of us are clueless (myself included for the most part). What other tactics and strategies exist for paying down student loans? What resources are out there for determining the optimal amount that should be paid on a monthly basis. 

Ideally, I'd like to compile a side-bar quality guide to this process. In lieu of that, simply listing resources in this thread would suffice. Hopefully it will be helpful for me and my many loan-battling comrades. 

**Edit for clarification:** What I'm proposing isn't laying out an ABC plan that applies to everyone, but rather collecting all of the resources, commonly applicable plans, etc. in one place as a pick-and-choose/awareness raising tool box for people paying down student loans.

* [Income based Repayment](http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-based)

* A guide on how to break down and pay individual sub-loans on Nelnet. (Which I'd love to create right now, but I'm at work)

&gt;Does the earnings return from a diploma with the name of an elite institution stamped on it justify the higher expense, or is the reputation of the college aristocracy vastly overblown, at least when it comes to subsequent income?

* This is usually a hard question to answer, because, 
""students who attend selective schools are likely to have higher earnings potential regardless of where they attend college for the very same reasons that they were admitted to the more selective schools in the first place.""

So what the researchers did, was find a comparable group of students who had similar SAT scores and were accepted &amp; rejected from the same schools in 1972, and then followed-up with them in 1995 to see how they 'turned out'...

* They find that **school selectivity**, measured by the average SAT score of the students at a school, **doesn't pay off in a higher income over time**.
* the average **SAT score of the schools students applied to** but did not attend **is a much stronger predictor of students' subsequent income** than the average SAT score of the school students actually attended.
* They do find that **some aspects of colleges are related to students' subsequent economic success** ... students who attend colleges with higher average tuition costs or spending per student tend to earn higher incomes later on.  The authors speculate that tuition may affect future earnings because **schools with higher tuitions offer more resources or higher quality products to their students**. But with college costs up sharply since then, returns have probably come down to a more normal range. 
* No matter what measurement of college quality is used, the **income gains from attending an elite college are highest for students from a disadvantaged background.**

So the manager gave me two options, either prove the income (which makes no sense... I had a cosigner) or give it back and relieve me of all financial responsibility. I could have kept the car and fought them and refinanced through a credit union or something I'm sure also.

I remembered the response I got on here and I am happy to say the car is no longer in my possession. With $0 lost (except for a week of increased insurance). I'm back in my paid off car and I'm driving my brother's car while he's in the navy so I can set aside enough money to fix my car (needs ~$500 of work to be drivable again ... a bit less than $16.5k).

I've always tried to be smart with my own money, but I'm just about living month-to-month and have never even had a significant amount in my savings account. I definitely don't want to be like one of the cases you always hear about where someone comes into a significant amount of money and is destitute within a few years.

I'm meeting with a lawyer to go over the specifics and I plan on giving some of the money to family and potentially donating a significant portion of it.
But, are there are other steps I should take?

**UPDATE**:

This post got much more attention than I could have imagined, so thank you to everyone who gave advice. As a quick update, I wanted to let people know that while most people in my life understand I have inherited a house and some funds, they are completely unaware of the total amount, and I have no plans to tell them, at least not yet. Even the lawyer I met with, who has been a long-time friend of our family, was in complete shock over the amount (he was thinking more like $250,000).

I should also note, since many people had to make assumptions because I gave no background info, that I own my own car (paid in full), have no children, and aside from credit card balances, have no debt to speak of. The estate I am inheriting also has no debt. I also have a steady job that I enjoy and make roughly $80,000 annually.

After the Thanksgiving holiday, once a lot of this has sunk in, I will try to update everyone on the situation and some of the decisions I've made.

I love collecting data, so I thought I'd share some of my own as additional info for all of you thinking about buying a home.

For what it's worth, IMO, renting is not throwing away money. If you don't have all your personal finances in order, don't look at your home as the key to starting your investment portfolio. Save and emergency fund, start saving for retirement, get rid of your high interest debt. If you can do those things while renting - then you are still ""investing"" and you are just paying for your shelter.

So in addition to running the numbers on your mortgage, make sure you include taxes, insurance, and closing costs (which can be anywhere from a few thousand to up to $10k).

Then, if the size of your home is bigger than what you are renting, a conservative estimate I used was to double the utilities at my apartment. Then also don't forget maybe additional utilities you didn't have to pay when you rented, for us it was water.

Now here is some data I've been collecting and thought I'd share. We've owned our home three years now. Here is a breakdown of expenses by year for the home in three key categories -- Needs (ex: fix the roof), Wants (ex: paint the living room), and Furniture (the silent killer when upgrading to a bigger place. Oh, and this is a home built in 1950 in the northeast.

2011
Needs: $11k
Wants: $5k
Furniture: $6k
Total: $22k

2012
Needs: $8k
Wants: $500
Furniture: $1500
Total: $10k

2013 (6 months in)
Needs: $1200
Wants: $200
Furniture: $0
Total: $1400

3 year total
Needs: $20k
Wants: $5,700
Furniture: $7,500
Total: $33,200

You can see how expensive the first year was and even year two. But now year three has been a lot less expensive. We are more settled on furniture, painting, etc. But there are still a lot of maintenance projects and the needs find a way to pop up (leak in the basement a few weeks ago). 

When we bought our home we knew there was work that needed to be done, some of it wants, some of it needs. There is plenty of room in this list of spending to cut wants and furniture for your own needs, I'm just sharing what we did. And in the first year, most of the needs we knew about going in (make sure if you know work needs to be done, get an estimate BEFORE you sign the P&amp;S), so you know what the needs are.

I loved reading this type of real world stuff before I bought, so I hope this helps any of you who are planning.

My wife just quit her job to stay home with our 3 month old daughter, so I'm not sure how the new money situation is going to be.  She only made $30k a year, so it's not going to hit us hard.  We have been living on my salary only since September of last year, and it hasn't been difficult at all.

I have been saving up to pay off the $26k student loan.  I didn't want to pay it off in pieces, due to having the baby recently, and I didn't know how those costs were going to be.  Now that we've maxed out our deductible, I'm comfortable with paying this loan off, but that would put our emergency fund down to 0.  Last year, I paid off $27k in student loans and would love to blow this one away as well.  I don't feel comfortable doing that just yet.

My question is, what should I do with the $27k until I have enough built up to have a $10k-15K safety net?  i.e. I don't want to pay it off til November or so.  Or do I just wait til I have saved enough to pay off the $37k loan plus emergency fund (another year or so from now)?

My wife makes significantly more than me (she's an RN, I'm working on a second degree) and she manages all of our bills, until recently (about a year after our wedding) we didn't even have a joint checking account.

We've been talking about making some financial leaps recently (financing a car we can depend on, preparing to buy a house in the next two years). Thing is, every time I started to get into specific time frames and strategies for getting us there, I'm met with ""I don't know, my credit is pretty bad"". She had been telling me about owing on medical bills, and she just didn't seem to have much faith that we could turn her credit around and get on track to being able to put on our financial big-boy-pants.

So, I did our taxes, and I figured a good next step would be to review our credit reports to see if there was anything on hers that we could close out and put behind us. It's way worse than I thought. She has one medical bill on her report that is in collections, but it's not a huge amount; however, it turns out she has 3 student loans I never knew about, all 3 of which are C/O. Also, her last semester of school was never paid for and is in collections. 

To make matters worse, her student loan debt has been channeled through 3 different offices, on each of 3 different loans, resulting in a total of 9 defaults listed on her report.

Now, my score is in the mid 600s because I still carry about $50k in student loans that are currently deferred. Hers is in the low 400s. I think I can literally hear my plans for home ownership fizzling away into the air. So, what happens now? Should we try to consolidate? Declare bankruptcy? Should we just give up? I'm at a loss.

I should note, I haven't talked to my wife about this. I really think it would benefit me to have some idea what I think we should do before we have this talk. Also, I'm a little shaken and I don't want it to turn into an argument. Please help?

**TL;DR: I checked my wife's credit report and it turns out we are in way worse shape than I thought. We really wanted to buy a home in the next 2-3 years, but I don't know how to broach the subject with her, much less where to start picking up the pieces.**

1359578774.0,286,self.personalfinance,17kzgp,My unsolicited by fairly solid personal finance advice for you 20 something redditors posting questions in r/personalfinance.  ,349,63,131,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/17kzgp/my_unsolicited_by_fairly_solid_personal_finance/,"There seems to be a lot of questions here especially regarding debt and investing that keep coming in the 20 something age range so I wanted to share a bit of advice general advice.  Think of it coming from your 10 year future self ;)  

DEBT
If you are 20 something and in CC or student loan debt your main focus should be paying off your loans even if they have a manageable monthly fee.  CC debit is terrible.  If you have CC debt stop what you are doing and cut expenses and get that paid off.  Student loan debt should also be paid off as soon as you can even if the interest rate is lowish.  If you are in debt and see others posting about investing and start feeling like ""maybe i should start investing too!"" please realize that PAYING OFF YOUR DEBT IS INVESTING IN YOUR FUTURE.  Paying off your debt means guaranteed return on your money and you'll be getting out of paying some company tens of thousands of dollars. This is money that is coming straight out of your future self's bank account.

Once you get out of debt be very wary of debt.  Remember that nobody gets anything for free.  Debt just means someone else is making money off of your shortsighted vision of the future.  The easier the debt is the more money they are making off of you.  

INVESTING
Once you are out of debt investing is important so if you are 20 something and asking questions about investing you are in great shape.  Take a deep breath and know that the most valuable investment you can make is to learn about the basics of investing and building up the habit of investing.  Knowledge gathering and habit forming are way more important than what specific mutual fund you invest in.  It takes time so be patient and learn before you invest.  Over time knowing what you are investing will be much more important than an extra month or two in the stock market.  Ask questions like ""what should i look for in a mutual fund?"", ""what is an expense ratio?"", ""what is an index?"" instead of ""where should i put my hard earned money"".

LIVE BELOW YOUR MEANS
This is by far the most important bit of information I can pass on to you.  We live in a culture that does not encourage this but please please please live below your means.  Avoid the temptation of lifestyle inflation.  Keep track of your expenses and know where your money is going.  Remember it isn't how much you make that counts but how much you keep.

That is all.  Be well fellow denizens of the internet.

Until I turned 18, I lived paycheck to paycheck on about $1400 a month (I was a math tutor). Now I'm an exotic dancer (got the job three months ago) and I make about $5,000 per month, and I've been told by my coworkers that my hourly income will double during the summer and be fairly consistent the other 8-9 months (I live in a beachy tourist town). I also plan to work about twice as much during the summer because I won't be in school. So I'll probably be making anywhere from $60k-$110k this year and every year I dance. 

I grew up poor but educated, so while I'm not dumb, I know NOTHING about money. I am planning to do all of my taxes legally, but I will get an accountant to do it so I only pay what I have to (I'm an independent contractor). 

I'm currently finishing up community college with no debt, and just got accepted to a University of California campus to finish my BS in Mathematics. Tuition is ~$13k/yr, and I'm going to take 3 more years to work on my undergrad. After that I plan to pursue a PhD in Mathematics, but I obviously won't be paying tuition then. I plan to keep dancing until I'm too old for it to be lucrative (I enjoy the job!) so I probably have about 10-15 years of this kind of income. I'll be working in my real field after that, obviously, so I will still have an income of unknown size. 


I need help figuring out how to invest. All I have now is a checking account and credit card with BofA and four savings accounts with Ally - one for taxes (which I put 26% of my income in every month), one for tuition (I have a strict plan to make sure I can afford the payments as they're due), one for emergencies (typically put about $600-800 a month in that) and one for travel/fun (that one gets whatever's left when I feel like it, maybe $200-700 a month). I currently only have like $5,000 to my name, mostly in those Ally savings accounts, but it's growing fast. 

Should I open an IRA now? Everyone says Roth is ideal for people who start young, but I think this doesn't apply to me because I am actually in a higher tax bracket now then I ever will be again in my life! Am I right? Should I open a traditional IRA? 

As far as other investments go, I'm clueless. I know what CDs are and I've been thinking about investing in the stock market but I don't know where to start. I'm also toying with the idea of investing in real estate because prices are low and I could have rental income, but I don't know if that's a good idea or if it's realistic. 

Any tips on how to not let the money go to my head?

Once the loan was sold I got the paperwork and was able to sign in online and see the debt, I made my payment and went on my way.

Three weeks later and I try to sign in to make another payment and my username is rejected.  I couldn't have had the wrong username / password since I have that information stored safely away.  Plus when I use the wrong password it gives me a different notification.

So I call them. Lo and behold their phone plays the automated message: ""the subscriber you have reached is out of the service area.""

I've been trying for over a week and a half to get through and my bill is due on the last of the month, I'm completely confounded.  

I'm not alone, in my googling of KSA Servicing I found this mint.com topic:  https://satisfaction.mint.com/mint/topics/fed_student_loan_sold_to_ksa_servicing

The topic is supposed to address mint support of KSA, but has turned more into group therapy about how we are all fucked.

So I guess my question is, other than keep trying because I am, what do I do?  Is this going to affect my credit if I don't pay until I can talk to someone?


EDIT:

I finally got through to their phone system, but after over an hour of waiting and no one picking up I decided to use their automated system which I really didn't want to do since there isn't any paper trail about the payment other than the withdraw posting to my bank account.  Hopefully they will get their shit together and I can use the online system next month.  In the mean time I'm going to contact every single person mentioned in this thread and complain.

Its absurd to me that my loans would be sold to some company that cannot handle the increase in traffic.  

Thank you all for your advice!  

**EDIT 2**

The mint forum received this post from a KSA employee for anyone interested:


*Dear mint.com users,* 


*I do want you to know that I have been monitoring all of your comments and passing them on to management. Please believe me when I say that they are not falling on deaf ears. And, quite frankly, we do not begrudge you the right to voice and file your complaints. While we certainly do not excuse the inconveniences that you have been experiencing, for all of the planning, preparation, and training we at KSA have undergone, several things have occurred both inside and outside of our control that have drastically affected our ability to provide the quality customer service we are so determined to deliver. Those issues are being worked on as expediently as humanly possible, including the problems with the phone line licenses (why you are receiving a fast busy or call back later message or not getting through at all). However, these issues will not be resolved overnight. We are also requiring mandatory overtime for staff, utilizing back-up staff to assist with the call volume, and performing additional document processing and e-mail queue work on the weekend. This will continue until all issues are resolved and servicing reaches an acceptable level.*


*If you submitted payments to your previous servicer, it will take 60 to 90 days post-conversion for the payments to be posted to your account and will reflect the date the payment was made. Likewise for forms and paperwork. If your paperwork was submitted to KSA and has been received by us, it is being worked in the order in which it was received and processing will reflect that date. Specifically, the correspondence queue currently being worked is on Feb. 1st; the repayment plan queue (e.x. IBR processing) is on February 2nd; the e-mail queue is on February 8th; and the deferment/forbearance queue is on Feb. 18th. Call wait time is still very high, due in part to this problem with phone line licenses, but if you do get through - I *strongly* encourage you to select the option to receive a call back to the number from which you dialed. It may take 24 hours to receive a call back.* 


*Finally, please note that KSA does NOT charge late fees and has no plans to do so unless mandated by the Department of Ed.* 


*If I can be of any other general assistance, I am happy to do so. And again, I apologize for our failure to deliver high quality customer service from the start.*


*Sincerely,* 


*Erin*

She has QUITE a bit of medical bills. She fought vulvar and then lung cancer for two and a half years with no insurance. A lot of the care was donated through charities, but there's still a lot that wasn't. I know she's at least tens of thousands in medical debt (there's probably $10k alone owed to EMS + ER visits) but I don't think anyone knows exactly how much (I never expected her to get approved for Medicare honestly, neither did the social worker from hospice, and I was under the impression I'd never be accountable for her medical debt, so when she was on her death bed I didn't bother keeping track of the medical bills that came... but trying to figure it out now, with there being so many different people she owes all over the place and some in different collections, is hard).

But since Medicare was approved I've been trying to get in contact with the people billing her to let them know, but a lot of it has gone to collections, and I haven't received any of the info I actually need in the mail yet (or I should say she hasn't), like the Medicare claim number.

Is this money mine? Will bill collectors try to claim it? Will the government just keep it?

1367087639.0,254,self.personalfinance,1d87pq,"I work at a bank, and my manager is destroying customer's IRAs/retirement accts [need advice, complicated]",325,71,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1d87pq/i_work_at_a_bank_and_my_manager_is_destroying/,"Background: I just started working at a small bank [less than 30 branches] in the Northwest, I'm looking forward to working towards a career in commercial banking, but I've started as a teller to learn operations and this bank has good training programs. My mom has been in commercial banking for 38 years, she's helping me on my career track.

My boss is a woman who doesn't listen well, doesn't take correction, and makes sure you know she doesn't appreciate feeling stupid. If I ask her a question she doesn't know the answer to, she stares at me while smiling and just blinks a few times, she'll hold the gaze too [intimidation tactic? it's so weird]. She also bad mouths everyone she works with in upper management, a lot of gossip too.

The situation: My mom had an IRA at a different bank and wanted to move it, and also wanting to support me she asked about my bank's IRA accounts. My boss put together a proposal and sent it home with me. As my mom and I looked over her proposal we found she was trying to sell a 10 year Annuity (which she's being very pushy about), and honestly, it's a terrible deal just as an Annuity but here's the worst party: It's not an IRA but my boss thinks it is. She told us in writing it's a tax sheltered account, and it's not.

If we went through with it, this is what would have happened:
1. it wouldn't have been a transfer IRA, it would have been a full withdrawal of her IRA funds, meaning there's all taxes immediately due on 66k USD. My mom is in the 28% tax bracket. There's also a 10% penalty with withdrawing funds before age 59 and 1/2, and she's 58 years old. So due that first year in taxes would have been ~25k USD.
2. If she didn't have 25k lying around to pay the taxes, she would have to withdraw funds from the annuity she just purchased, which has an 8% penalty on principal for early withdrawal in the first year. 
3. If the above happened, due to my mom's extensive banking knowledge she would have contacted the bank president and sued the bank, and they probably would have settled because no bank wants that egregious of an error to mar their reputation and banks have insurance accounts that cover errors like this. My boss would probably be fired as a result as well. 

This puts me in a precarious position. My mom simply told my boss she decided to go with charles schwabb, which is fine, lucky she's smart and crisis is averted.

The pickle I'm in now: she's continuing to push customers into annuities that are not tax sheltered but telling them they are. She's telling small business owners they can open 401ks for themselves then making them sign annuities made with untaxed profits from their businesses, or that they can roll their 401k or IRA into an annuity that's tax sheltered, which it isn't and they can't. The business owners likely won't get F'd until they're audited, so it could be a few years. I think my boss has been doing this for 2 years so far without fallout, while receiving the bonus she gets for annuity investment sales. 

If I say anything to upper management, politically it could ruin me (it's complicated, I can't go into detail). I don't think my boss would be receptive to correction from an entry level teller, and there's also the chance that she knows what she's doing. I can't figure out a way to tell the customers without implicating myself in a massive violation of bank policy. 

My mom's career advice is to stand by, don't say anything and let the fallout come without involving myself. She says managers like mine -always- get bitten by doing things like this. She gives it 3-4 years maximum before my boss is fired or promoted to a place of total ineptitude, then fired. 

Meanwhile I have a moral dilemma, I care for the customers. I don't want them to get audited and F'd, I want their retirement accounts to give them good returns and a long happy retirement. I don't want their businesses to suffer. Many are first generation immigrants and wouldn't know to sue the bank and be irate anyway. Is there anyway to stop this without implicating myself? I also don't know how far up it goes, what if our regional director knows about it? Or what if it's an honest mistake and my manager really is just that stupid?

The bright side is it's a small bank and she really isn't that successful.


TLDR; my manager is lying (either knowingly or unknowingly) to sell annuities with a high penalty for early withdrawal for a bonus.

P.S. Ideas I've already had: apply to other banks and expose everything. 2, send out an email about 'helpful differences between IRAs 401ks and Annuities' to try to tip off other employees too

EDIT - I've been asked what my background in finance and investing is. None. I read the Wall Street Journal and several business news wires every day as part of my job. One of my majors in undergrad was economics, which qualifies me for jack shit. And I've learned from the enormous mistakes that I have made trading stocks. That's it. 

I do not short stocks, I do not trade on margin and I do not enter into futures contracts. Too risky and too time consuming for my tastes. I do not have the stomach for that kind of speculation.

Explained,295,57,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/12mry8/your_credit_score_explained/,"I wrote an article [here](http://liteforecast.com/2012/11/4/credit-score-explained-fico-300-850), but am pasting the entirety of it below:

If you're in your early 20's, chances are that you haven't paid that much attention to your credit score. You're probably living in an apartment or with your parents and are just starting a new job. Your credit score is last thing on your mind.

Problem is, when you plan on getting a mortgage on a new home or get a loan for that car you've been eyeing, that pesky credit score become increasingly important. In this article, I'll explain what a credit (FICO) score is, what it's made up of, and why you need to worry about it.

What Exactly is a Credit Score?

In simple terms, a credit (FICO) score reflects how good you are with borrowing money and paying it back. TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian are the three FICO score reporters in the United States. Whether it's a credit card, a mortgage or a utility payment, a credit score brings together all of your financial borrowings from institutions like Discover, Chase or Wells Fargo, crunches the numbers, and spits out a numerical value determining how likely you are to pay back your loan. It ranges from 300-850 and, you guessed it, the higher the score, the better the chances of you getting a credit card with a higher credit limit and/or an auto or mortgage loan with a lower interest rate.

The Five Components

A credit score is made up 5 components: Payment History, Amount Owed, Length of Credit History, Inquiries, and Types of Credit Used.

* Payment History: The bulk of your score is made up of your payment history. Always paid your credit card on time, without carrying a balance? Good. 35% of your entire credit score is determined by how timely you are on paying your bills. Whether it's utility bills or auto loan bills or even mortgage payments, as long as you're making payments on time, your credit score will strengthen.

* Credit Utilization: The second biggest chunk, weighing in at 30% is your utilization. Credit utilization refers to how much of your available credit your actually using. If you have over $100k of credit available, but are only using $10k, you'll have a utilization of 10%. Generally speaking, the lower the utilization the better because if you have high utilization, you're relying on credit to keep you afloat too much. Financial institutions are usually wary of customers who tend to utilize too much of their available credit.

* Length of Credit History: If you're just turning 18, you probably don't have any credit to report. That's good. But now, you have to start working on building up your credit history. The age of your open accounts determines 15% of your credit score. The longer you have a credit card open, or the longer you have a mortgage under your name (with TIMELY payments), the better your credit history.

* Inquiries: Opening a large amount of credit cards in a short period won't help your score. Just because you're pre-approved with 0% APR for 6 months doesn't mean you should go ahead and apply for that card. New credit, or opening new loans in a short period of time has a negative impact on your credit history because companies will issue inquiries on your credit report to determine if you're eligible to receive credit. It also determines 10% of your total history, so stay away from opening 4-5 cards too quick just because you started working.

* Types of Credit Used: So you have a couple credit cards open. You're making timely payments but your credit score won't budge past the 750-775 mark. Why? Because your credit isn't diversified. You need a wide diversity of credit to make your credit score rise. That wide diversity includes auto loans, mortgage loans, utility payments, and credit cards. 

Your Job in Maintaining and Increasing Your Credit Score

Now that you have an idea of what actually makes up your credit score, it's time to delve into what you can do to strengthen it. You don't automatically start with a score of 850 and get hit every time you miss a payment. When you have nothing to report. you're credit score will actually be towards the lower end of the spectrum. Just like there are five components of what makes up your credit score, there are five, simple things you can do to strengthen that credit score:


* Whether your 18 or 28 and are starting out building your credit, open ONE credit card account and try maintaining a good payment history on that account. Check out NerdWallet for help on which credit card to open. For me, it was my bank credit card. You won't be getting high rewards for your first credit card, but don't sweat it. As long as there are no annual or hidden fees, you're golden. 

* Once you know you can manage ONE credit card and have a good amount of TIMELY payments (a 12-24 monthly payments is a good start) you can try opening a second card that has a good rewards program. The ones I've found are the American Express Preferred Card and the Chase Freedom Card. Again, check out NerdWallet for their detailed reviews.

* MAKE TIMELY PAYMENTS. I can't stress this enough. Even if you've been able to open many credit cards over the length of your credit history, make sure you're making your payments in a timely fashion. Not only will you improve your credit score tremendously (Remember, your payment history consists of 35% of your entire credit score), but you'll also avoid late fees and interest charges.

* NEVER carry a balance. Pay off the Statement Balance EVERY MONTH. Wanna know an easy way to do that? If you can't afford something, don't buy it. Simple. Just because Apple released a new iPad and you have the one released last year, doesn't mean you have to above your means to buy the new one. There's absolutely no reason to carry a balance on your card. The amount owed on your entire credit line determines 30% of your credit score and if you end up carrying a balance that increases your amount owed, your credit history will take a detrimental hit.

* Monitor your credit. I use CreditKarma to monitor my credit report. You don't need to pay $15/month to get the exact scores if you're not planning on buying a new home through financing or getting an auto loan. CreditKarma monitors your credit report and gives you a conservative guess on what your credit score probably is. For me, it's usually lower than what my score actually is, but that's good. It keeps me grounded.

TL;DR

If you can only take away a couple things from this article, remember this: make timely payments to pay off your statement balance every month and never carry a balance. These two actions will make sure that you will never end up with a credit score that isn't optimal for your needs.

1368114932.0,237,self.personalfinance,1e09lp,"""Why Invest in Bonds At All?"" Answer:",289,52,154,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1e09lp/why_invest_in_bonds_at_all_answer/,"[First, some charts showing historical returns based on stock/bond ratio](http://lazytraders.com/insights/stocks-vs-bonds-diminishing-returns-of-100-risk-allocations/) - note that as you approach 100% stocks, the magnitude of your bad years starts to spiral ever more steeply toward the abyss. 

Second, bonds reduce volatility, and [less volatility can mean more wealth](http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=116038&amp;newpost=1690871) (edit: [See Clarification by kurds_way below](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1e09lp/why_invest_in_bonds_at_all_answer/c9vk4il?context=3)), all else being equal - lowering volatility is not just downside protection, though that is part of it.

Third, bonds also hedge permanent equity-market meltdowns and long recovery periods, which often coincide with personal unemployment (e.g. the economy tanks, taking your portfolio balance and steady job along with it). Don't take my word for it - check out the risk-adjusted results via a [backtesting spreadsheet](http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=2520).

Fourth, most of the [Trinity Study](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study) data and wise industry figures advocate at least some cash (basically a zero-duration bond) if not some bonds at all times. I realize this is a bit of 'appeal to authority' but if you read books by Benjamin Graham, Jack Bogle and the like, you'll find they can back up their arguments well.

Finally, though all-stock active traders seem to forget this, bonds may provide an opportunity to [rebalance during the downturn](http://lazytraders.com/insights/market-myths-5-active-trader-mistakes-about-down-markets/) - if the market tanks but your job is intact, your (safe) bonds are likely flat or up, and rebalancing will naturally allow you to get equities at relatively cheap prices. This is not a riskless strategy (stocks could go down further) but can work to a long-term accumulator's advantage.

**tl;dr Benjamin Graham has a good rule of thumb - never be less than 25% or more than 75% either stocks or bonds** - push the limits of that range and you expose yourself to risks (be it equity volatility on the one hand, or inflation and interest rates on the other).",,False,,t5_2qstm,1368118679.0,,,True,t3_1e09lp,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1e09lp/why_invest_in_bonds_at_all_answer/,
1362665913.0,233,self.personalfinance,19ufrn,Ex girlfriend plans to just walk away from her debts and drop off the radar.  What can she expect?,306,73,261,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/19ufrn/ex_girlfriend_plans_to_just_walk_away_from_her/,"TL;DR - she has a mortgage, student loan, and credit card balance, and has quit paying on them, with plans to go AWOL in a couple or three months.  What will happen regarding the debts and how long will she be a hot target by her creditors?

Long version:

My ex girlfriend has become mentally ill over the last year and just isn't relating to the world any more.  She has been unemployed for 2 years, and we split up over the course of the last 6 months as she refuses to recognize her illness, much less seek treatment, with me ultimately moving out in late November.  Since then I've been trying to steer her back on course but she refuses and is just nosediving into a financial pit.

She has a condo to the tune of $9xx/month mortgage and another $250/month in condo fees.  She is severely upside-down on the place, owing about $130K but she'd be lucky to sell it for half that.  Between my rent and her ex-husband's child support, she was able to cover this, but she is just about to miss her 3rd mortgage payment at this point.  Her condo fees are an additional month or 2 behind.  

She has some old student loan debt remaining, I don't recall the exact number but I'm pretty sure it's under $20K at this point.

The mortgage/condo and student loan payments were set up on a auto-payment plan to deduct funds from her bank account, but once they drained it dry and caused overdraft charges, she just closed the account rather than deal with her lender and condo board to stop the auto-debits.

And as I recall she has a $3xxx balance on a single credit card with her bank (that she closed her checking/savings with), and she has recently stopped making the minimum payments on that so that she can keep her phone/data plan going.

She is on state/federal assistance for medical and food stamps, and her only income at this point is child support which covers utilities, auto expenses, phone, and incidentals.

At one point not that long ago she was determined to just let everything lapse including her car insurance (and therefore tags/registration) and utilities (she had a shut-off notice) and she was just going to pack what she could into her Corolla and drive to the midwest and leave her 8 year old son with his father with no notice, and she had no plan beyond that.  I've managed to convince her to stay on top of the utilities and car stuff, but her home is a lost cause and foreclosure is looming.  No idea where in the process it is, probably just getting formally started with the third payment being missed any day now.  I know she's not opening the mail from her lender.

Hopefully she'll be able to stay in the house until the school year ends in June.  Her son is 8 by the way.

I tried to encourage her to file chapter 7 bankruptcy to get her debts formally released, but she's not interested.


Anyway, assuming she does make it until June without being evicted, her son spend summers with family in the midwest and she will definitely be abandoning her house at that point, and will likely find herself somewhere in the midwest as well.  Knowing her, she won't forward mail (she'd ignore it anyway) and will essentially just go AWOL.  What's going to happen with her debts?

I'm assuming the foreclosure will just happen as usual, and the bank will just have to eat it.  Mortgage is backed by Freddie Mac, so the bank isn't going to be too upset.  
The condo board will turn her account over to their collections attorney, but given that she has no money and no assets other than her vehicle, that's not likely to go anywhere.  
Her student loan will also likely go to a collection agency, yes?  
Her credit card balance, I'm not sure how that will be handled.  Collections as well?

I suppose the root of the question is, there's nothing to go after to recover her debts, so the creditors will likely just eat it all, but is she going to be in any legal trouble afterwards?   I think she plans to just go off the radar and either live a quiet life in the rural midwest, or she may just end up homeless.  

Either way, how is this going to haunt her, and for how long?  Is there any criminal risk here that could bite her in the ass, or is it all just civil as far as the legal system is concerned?

1356636656.0,232,self.personalfinance,15j5wz,PSA: Please Do Not Panic About the 'Fiscal Cliff' (US),296,64,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/15j5wz/psa_please_do_not_panic_about_the_fiscal_cliff_us/,"As the end of the year approaches, I have seen an increasing number of threads with concerns about the fiscal cliff. While anything is always possible, either via action or inaction on the part of the government, I believe the media has been unfortunately successful in scaring people about the implications of what is likely to be a non-event.

First, please keep in mind that neither political party wants to raise taxes on the lower or middle classes. Both parties will go to great lengths to avoid being responsible for a tax increase on ordinary Americans. Second, not much actually happens right at the end of the year, and those things that do take effect soon can easily be reversed in whatever compromise legislation is established.

No one can predict the future, but the media has made the term 'fiscal cliff' sound like an end-of-the-world scenario. It isn't. Moreover, it is also very unlikely to take shape in the worst-case-scenario-fashion they seem to prefer discussing. Tax rates are always at risk of going up, but, if I may speculate, with so many eyes on the matter right now more than ever, well, no politician wants to let this happen.

I am not suggesting you do not post questions (or answers) about pending tax changes, just keep in mind that there is little most people can do about this anyway - jumping into or out of the market, or trying to reorganize your income for preferable taxation, are unlikely to help the situation. Further, many of the changes will mostly impact higher-earning individuals and people with large taxable investments, who have financial cushions.

Instead of a tl;dr from me, another r/PF contributor [Khal_Goodman](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/15ioz2/us_what_will_happen_to_my_paycheck_when_we_go_ove/c7mt9hx) summarizes the situation well:

&gt; Can I just point out that if there isn't a deal before the 1st, anything passed will be retroactive to protect the over whelming majority of tax payers? And I don't believe there is anyone in either the Senate/House/White House that wants income taxes to go up for every tax payer.

-----

One more quote. I realize their focus is on the impact to the equity markets, but I think [Morningstar](http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=578602) has done a good job of summarizing the issue in this case: 

&gt; Despite the media's penchant for touting the fiscal cliff as a major crisis, we think it will end up being a non-event. It has to get resolved one way or another ... We have tried to avoid the topic everyone else can't seem to stop talking about--the dreaded fiscal cliff--but alas, here we are.

&gt; First, we expect the fiscal cliff will get resolved, if not by the end of the year, then shortly into the new year. Nothing actually falls off a cliff on Jan. 1; most of the changes would start to have impacts over the course of the year. Second, if our politicians actually do refuse to compromise, we may face a recession but at least our fiscal situation will be much improved.",,False,,t5_2qstm,1356646338.0,,,True,t3_15j5wz,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/15j5wz/psa_please_do_not_panic_about_the_fiscal_cliff_us/,

1363275831.0,228,self.personalfinance,1aaf7b,"Resisted the urge to spend tax refund frivolously. Instead, paid off cars and student loans.",285,57,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1aaf7b/resisted_the_urge_to_spend_tax_refund_frivolously/,"I'll preface by saying that I'm not super tight with my money. I have automatic savings each month, but tend to spend whatever is left over. I obsessively keep track of where every dollar goes, and have a multi-account system that works great for me. I tend to spend in large chunks (vacations, electronics, etc.), but I manage to stick to my monthly savings plan and never touch that money. If I have ""extra"" money, I tend to spend it (still working on that). 

My wife and I got a large tax refund this year (nearly $8,000 - mortgage interest deductions do provide a nice treat at the end of the year). For a couple of weeks I kept wondering what I was going to gift myself. A new TV? A gaming PC? New carpet in the house? Or just a whole bunch of crap that I won't use in 6 months?


Finally I had to scratch that itch. We had one $6,000 car loan (4.75% - two years remaining); another $2,000 car loan (5.25% - 5 months remaining); and, a $4,000 student loan (6.5% - five years remaining). With $8,000 from our tax refund, and $3,000 in our ""vacation"" account, and some extra cash in our normal checking account, I decided to bite the bullet and go sans loans.



It doesn't feel as good as it did when I had to scratch and claw my way out of a $10,000 credit card balance six years ago. That was 12 excruciating months of saving &amp; paying off that loan. That was major relief and that period of repayment taught me a lot - like the fact that I can save money. Paying off these debts (which amounted to more than that $10k credit card) feels more like I'm finally being responsible - looking at the big picture. 


Instead of $750 each month towards those loans, now that $750 can reduce the impact of the $1200/month daycare expense we're about to have (wife is having our first child on Monday). 


No real lesson here; just wanted to share the joy of feeling responsible with someone other than my wife. Only 5 years ago I was atrociously bad with money. I'd bring home $20k in a year and spend $25k (on nothing of value). I fought my way back after being 6 months past due on multiple accounts. 5 years later, I own a house (it owns me), but I am still working on repairing my credit to refi to a better rate (~650 rating right now). Fortunately, my wife and I make a decent living, but we are both good at not going crazy with vacations, or really nice cars, or the other debts people can easily find themselves going into.

I had some money and decided to try and make some more using P2P lending, specifically lendingclub.

I invested in 31 loans originally, plus putting some money back in (either $700 or $800 capital, I can't remember).  To date, I have received $63 in interest.  One of my loans was paid off in the first payment.  Three loans are 31-120 days late, and the rest are still paying regularly.  One of those three has filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, and the other two have not been contacted yet.

The 1099-OID was sent to me electronically, and was easily entered into my tax return.

For the past couple of months I have been pulling my money out because it simply takes too long, and I don't have enough money in to really make money, nor am I willing to do so.

Instead, now I'm making more money, and I opened up a Barclays Online Savings account where I receive 1% annualized interest.




Edit: If you want my opinion, it's only worth it to invest if you put a lot of money in, but it's too risky to put a lot of money in.  With these online savings accounts giving between .5 and 1%, you're better doing that.

1354212903.0,217,self.personalfinance,1406ck,How Do Credit Cards Work?,270,53,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1406ck/how_do_credit_cards_work/,"I see so many misconceptions and fears about credit cards every day (especially on [r/personalfinance](www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance)) that I feel like I have to set the record straight. This information is based on my 5+ years experience with using credit cards, information taken from credit card company websites, and “terms of use” credit card documents. Most of this information is based on credit cards issued by financial institutions (banks, companies) in the United States. However, I’ve used cards all over the world and have found the experience to be very standardized.

**My First Credit Card**

I applied for my first credit card in 2007 as a sophomore in college. Up until that point, I had used my debit card for all my online and many in person transactions. I read online about getting reward points for purchases and I thought that could be a good way to make some extra cash.

I applied for an American Express Blue card, mostly because I thought AMEX was the most bad ass of cards. My grandfather, one of my heroes, is always rocking the AMEX Platinum. I wanted to be as cool as him.

Because I was still living as a dependent of my parents, when it the application asked for “annual household income,” I just guessed and said my parents made $120,000 a year. I had no problem getting approved for the AMEX Blue.

I eventually got a USAA credit card as well in 2008, because they use the MasterCard network, which was accepted more places than the American Express. Since 2008 I’ve opened and closed several credit card accounts with Citi, Chase, and USAA.

**My Experience**

I’ve used Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. I haven’t experimented with the Discover network, but I heard good things about it. I closed the original AMEX I got because the reward program wasn’t the best on the market. I’ve kept my USAA card account open, but cut up the card and don’t use it for anything but paying my USAA automobile insurance. Because the USAA card is now my oldest credit line, I’ll probably keep it open until the end of time, so that it increases the average age of my accounts. (Average age of accounts is 15% of your credit score.) I’ve played the credit card sign up bonus game and made hundreds of dollars that way. I’ve made $1000s in credit card reward points.

Most importantly though, I have never accumulated any credit card debt. The credit card companies and banks that issue me my cards have never received a dime in interest, late fees, finance charges, or any other fee from me. It’s really easy to do, I’ll show you how:

**Credit Cards Are Not Rocket Science**

I think a lot of people make credit cards harder than they have to be. Credit cards are a way for you to easily pay for goods and services, online, over the phone, or in person. (I guess by mail too, if that’s still a thing.) They are known in the industry as a “revolving line of credit.”

Every credit card (except a very few) have a credit limit. This is the amount of money the card issuer trusts you with. For some students starting out, the limit may be as low as $500. For Wall Street bankers, they might have access to $100,000. At one point, as an unemployed college student, my American Express limit was $18,000. Pretty crazy when I only had $800 to my name.

Credit cards also come with interest rates attached to them. This scares a lot of people, but you have to realize: if you do it right, you’ll never even know what your interest rate is. Keep reading to find out why.

**Credit Cards vs. Debit Cards**

Debit cards deduct money from your checking account. They are almost the same as cash. That’s it. Simple. No bills, no statements, no delayed payments. You can only spend what is in the account linked to your debit card.

Credit cards are only limited by the credit limit. So I could have spent $18,000 on a ski trip to Whistler if I had been real dumb in college. Fortunately for me, I wasn’t.

**Minimum due vs Statement Balance vs Current Balance**

Credit cards have a predetermined length of time until a statement or bill is generated. Usually this is four weeks or a month. At this point, all of the transactions that occurred from, say, Jan 1-Feb 2 are tallied up and presented to the card holder (you). You usually have 21 or so days from the time the bill is sent to you to pay the bill. You’ll generally be presented with three payment options: minimum due, statement balance, and current balance.

**Minimum Due**

This is the dangerous one. Remember that interest rate I mentioned earlier? If you pay this amount, anything that you leave unpaid will start accumulating interest. This is how people get into trouble with credit cards. They only make the minimum payments, which can be as low as $25 per month, while ignoring the fact that they have $1000s of unpaid balance that is now accumulating the insanely high interest rates credit cards come with. If you’re smart and don’t want to pay the credit card companies anything: DO NOT JUST MAKE MINIMUM PAYMENTS.

**Statement Balance**

This is the sum of all of your transactions during your billing cycle. So for instance, your billing cycle may run from the 15th of January to the 15th of February. If you had 10 transactions totaling $100 during that time, your minimum payment would probably be $15, and your statement balance would be $100.

You’ll receive your bill usually a few days after your billing cycle closes, so let’s say you get it on 18 February. Now, you’ll usually have 3 weeks to make your payment, so it will be due around 11 March. All of this information will be on your statement. In order to pay off your card and accumulate no interest charges, simply pay your statement balance before the due date. Easy. Done. This will pay for all of your transactions on that bill. Since you’ll probably still be using your card though, you may sill have a balance, which brings us to…

**Current Balance**

This is the sum total of all transactions that haven’t been paid yet. It’s usually equal to or greater than your statement balance. So for instance, if you had the $100 for 15 Jan to 15 Feb, and then you spent another $50 on 16 Feb, your current balance would be $150. To be extra cautious, you can simply pay your current balance at any time and you will be so far removed from interest charges you’ll never even think about them. I always pay my current balance. It’s just easier.

**Pending Charges on Credit Card**

Possibly the most annoying thing about credit cards is the pending charges. Because of the way the processing network is setup, credit card transactions often take 2-3 business days to process. That means that you could look at your current balance and see $0, while there’s $1000 in pending charges waiting to be processed. Annoying!

One way to get around this is to look at your pending charges, which will be listed online for most credit cards. Another way is to look at your available credit limit. This is updated almost instantaneously to reflect pending charges. So if your current balance is $0, your limit is $1000, but your available limit is $800, you probably have $200 in pending charges. Remember that so you don’t go spending money you don’t have!

This is how I get around this problem: Any time I make a credit card transaction, I move that amount of money from my main checking account to my “bills” account. That way when I look at my main checking account, I’ve already deducted the pending credit card charges. Then, every week or so, I pay off my current balance on all my credit cards from my bills account. My credit card balance goes to $0, I know I have the money to pay them in my bills account, my credit card reward points keep increasing, the credit card companies get their little slice of profits, and everyone is happy.

**How to Get Your First Credit Card**

Getting your first credit card is often too easy. As a student or military servicemember, you’re often a target demographic of the credit card companies.

I like using [NerdWallet.com](http://www.nerdwallet.com), because you can search for exactly the type of card you want and compare offers. I’d recommend a student card if you are in college or a secured card if you’re not. Only charge a few things to it a month and pay it in full every month. You will build yourself a great credit history and thank yourself later for not going into heaps of credit card debt.

While she's sleeping so many hours a day now, I've been trying to keep my mind off of her dying any way possible. I've got the memorial slideshow done, we've gone to the funeral home so her wishes are not in question, etc. etc.  Today while she sleeps I want to start making sure all our affairs are in order. She wants to make sure I'll be ok financially once she passes away.

I have made a throwaway account so I can use figures.

We've never really had any money to invest or anything - just our required payments to our municipal pensions. We just got out of credit card debt for the first time in November 2011.

Here's what is outstanding in debt:

* Mortgage (5.25%, ~$179K)
* HE Loan (currently 4.25%, $35K)

*(House value is probably down to about $165K now)*

* Auto Loan (1.9%, 36 months remaining @ $435/mo, outstanding balance $15K)

That's it.

When she passes, there is a 

* $200,000 term life insurance policy
* $100,000 group term life insurance through her work
* $20,000 group term life insurance through my work (spouse amount)
* approx $85,000 lump payout from pension with an optional surviving spouse pension instead (if I'm reading this correctly it would be about $475 a month for the remainder of my life, taxable, and I think it would start now even though I am not 55 - I'm in my early 40s)

Salary info:

* I make ~$57K before taxes
* Before she went on disability last month she was making ~$60K before taxes

* We have about $10K in liquid savings for emergencies.

I think I should be paying off the house for sure, and I think I'll pay off or sell the car (I don't really need two, but mine is paid off and hers has far fewer miles). 

Paying off the three debts frees up $1600 a month. I'll have about $150K left over. I'll be able to fully fund a roth IRA for myself every year. There is also a 457b option at my work.

My worries are finding the right person to make sure I am making the right choices and investments to keep me going, while not getting beaten up in fees.

As I said before, I don't even know where to start. Everyone I know is pretty much blue collar paycheck-to-paycheck type people that at **most** have a small retirement contribution and an emergency savings account. The majority of people I know have neither and are buried in CC debt.

I'm just rambling now but thanks for reading and any tips you can offer.


**edited to add at a suggestion of a fellow redditor. This was a separate post I made down below:


A few more things in comments I had not read while typing -

Funeral expenses are $8K immediate and $5-$7K for her final wish (eternalreef.com)
There (should be) no outstanding medical expenses. We are HMO and everything has been paid.
Some people are saying here I shouldn't do anything for 6-12 months...would it be ok to pay off the house at least? I'd hate to piss away $4-$9K in interest if I don't need to. I really don't think I could walk away. We prided ourselves on our 770+ FICO scores and never being even a day late on anything. It would just seem wrong. We made an investment and it didn't pan out - I shouldn't get bailed out or ""cheat the system"" because of it. Just my opinion of course.

another separate post:

First off I'd like to thank everyone for your thoughts and well wishes. It has not been easy, but we are somehow keeping our shit together - I thought I would have lost it by now. 17 years in total, the last 13 almost non-stop chemo, radiation, surgeries, etc.
I'm sad I'm losing her but happy we got 17 years after diagnosis. Some people get diagnosed and don't even get 17 weeks.
Now to answer some questions that I've seen here (and maybe to ask some more):
I called our pension offices...the $85K is indeed taxable unless rolled over into a traditional IRA. The optional surviving spouse option is $3,000 lump sum (taxable unless rolled into traditional IRA) plus $487 a month (increasing 3% of the original $487 every January 1st, or $14.61 per month every year). That is taxable as well but since I'm the spouse they say there's no 10% penalty on top of it.
So it seems like a nobrainer to go monthly... well, as long as I live about 13-14 more years. I figure this amount will almost fully fund my yearly roth IRA - and am I reading I should go with Vanguard target date funds?
So that takes care of the Roth IRA every year.
Next... the house. Will I be able to live here even when she's going to die here? I think I'll be able to. Besides, we are quite upside down on it. It's already too big for the two of us at 1650 sq ft plus unfinished basement so if I went anywhere it would be smaller. Could I figure out a way to hide all this money and walk away - short sale or foreclosure and buy another place cash? I have no idea, but I'm still mostly morally opposed to it (even though a GMAC rep laughed at me when I asked if we could refinance under HARP last year - we re-fi'd a few months after the 5/31/09. Yes. Laughed.)
My 457b option seems to be a tax-deferred option only. It is ICMA. Apparently roth is allowable but only if my employer approves.
All that being said, leftover expenses for everything else are about $1700 a month, so I think it's doable. Plus, I'll have about $80K left from insurance. I'm thinking two years living expenses ($40K) and the other $40K...where? Just a CD, or I-bonds or something else?
Thanks again for the opinions and options. I have lots to think about. I also know (thanks to you all) how not to get rolled by someone.

Hello everyone! I've been reading this subreddit religiously for a little over a year. It was about that time I decided I didn't want to be saddled with car debt for the rest of my life. The monthly payment on my car was $375 at an interest rate of 15.49% (yikes!).

I tried refinancing but the car was a little too old with too many miles so I paid off my small college loans and rolled that payment into my car payment. On a given month I paid $200 to $300 above the minimum. The timing couldn't have been more perfect as my tax refund and work bonus came through at the same time. I had to pull a little from my emergency fund but now, I'm 100% debt free.

I'm lucky enough to be able to still live at home, so my next goals are to get the emergency fund to $4,000 then save aggressively ($1000 per month) for the foreseeable future. I am unsure of whether this will be for a house or to pay for a car in cash. It feels amazing to have that option!

I wrote a ~20 page document for him, outlining some plans for his goal of becoming debt-free.  Because it's my brother and I know him, I tried to make it as easy-to-read and entertaining as possible.

He called me the day he got it in the mail and said, ""Oh my god, that was awesome!  That was the funniest thing I've ever read.  I'm going out tonight, and now I feel a little guilty.  But I only have to save up $100 for the rest of this month, right?""

It was the first time he'd actually really talked about saving money, hah!  My mom called me the next day and said she had started reading it, and was halfway through and cracking up.

I doubt he'll follow the aggressive scenario, but I'm sure he won't just default to the base scenario, which is fine with me.

Just wanted to share!

Parents were heavily in debt and had to declare some sort of bankruptcy and they are considering putting me on the mortgage and having me take over payments and taking one or both of their names off. They are going to schedule an appointment with someone from the bank to discuss this sometime soon.

edit: the debt and bankruptcy  were declared in 2009, and my parents would assist me in the mortgage payments

edit2: 

I'd like to thank everyone. This was a very eye opening thread and it has more or less knocked some sense into me. My course of action will be to firmly deny any official-responsibility of my parents' finances. 

What I will do is help them with payments as needed and help them along the way to see if there are any other ways to ease their financial burdens - without putting myself at any risk. Thanks Reddit!

Hi, thanks for reading.  I recently finished grad school in May, and am still searching for jobs.   After delaying reviewing and understanding the totals of my student loans, I have finally faced the facts-  I have 7 private loans with Wells Fargo that total around $100,000 (Interest rates around 6-7%. I know these can be consolidated together..).  One private loan with Chase for $6,000 (10.52%), and finally I have $138,000 in Federal loans (Stafford, Graduate PLUS).  

All of these are in grace period until November/December, and I plan on applying for income-based repayment for the federal loans once I'm employed.

I know I made some bonehead decisions borrowing this much and letting it add up to an insane amount.  I just want to know if it's possible to dig my way out of this mess?  I'm on the job hunt right now and I'm trying not to be discouraged, which is why I'm turning to PF for help.

I put half to 75% of the paycheck in each time I got it. By 18, I had a job making $10/hour for 20 hours/week. I continued this until a few months into the year (around April of last year) when I needed tires for my car and went to get money from my savings account for this. 

The bank informed me that my parents changed the conditions on the account to not switch ownership to me on my 18th birthday. I stopped putting as much money in (cut down to 25-50%) and started just stashing cash under my bed. Now I'm 19 and make $15/hour working 30-40 hours a week and continue the bed method but with about $100 a week. 

I did ask my parents about this change the day of getting the new tires and my father insisted he pay for them and not to try to withdraw from the account. I asked why it was not in my name and he said that I need to prove to him that I can be responsible with it. At the time there wasn't much else I could do (given this was during college decisions time and there was already enough tension from my parents about this matter)

Recently, my father opened one of the bank statements and saw I haven't deposited into it. I got a lecture saying that I was not proving myself to be responsible with my money because I wasn't saving it. I told them that I didn't feel comfortable saving in an account that was taken out of my name (but didn't mention the bed stash). This turned into an argument about my lack of trust in them. He basically told me I either start saving and he will give the account to me **when he think's I'm ready** or he'd give it to me now and I'd have to pay upwards of $500 a month in rent.

I currently still live with my parents for.. many reasons unrelated to this issue (including but not limited to them refusing to let me go to any school but a terrible local university despite full scholarships to multiple highly ranked schools and acceptance into an ivy league). 

My only real expenses are car insurance which is $450 a month (a plan which my parents picked out for me.. without giving me a say in the matter [had multiple quotes picked out, was looking into them and my father just decided to go with the most absurdly expensive one for me, payed with his own money and said I owed him monthly for it]) for a car in my name.

How would you handle this situation. I realize this isn't just a matter of personal finance but also family politics/other crap. I apologize for the shoddy organization of this post.

Note: The savings account has ~$10000 in it. My bed stash has a few thousand.

tl;dr Parents changed savings account conditions to prevent it from going into my name and now are threatening me for not saving in it

EDIT: Wow this thread exploded. Let me clarify a few things. My parents make rather good money (over 200k/year combined). I have seen the statements for the account and the money is there. The $450 a month is $350 for insurance and $100 to repay the $600 title change which happened recently).",,False,,t5_2qstm,1376181678.0,,,True,t3_1k26r4,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1k26r4/19_yo_i_recently_stopped_putting_money_in_my/,

http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/17q59b/help_finances_destroyed_only_recently_found_out_us/

First off, I confronted my wife about the state of our finances and what is going on with her business. I showed her the spreadsheets I had made that were showing how much money I was making every month and how our debt hadn't been decreasing. She showed me all of her accounts, from the store cards to the business account and then we planned out a budget that we could actually follow.

Personal expenses were reduced to $50 each. This includes everything from buying new clothes to eating out. Entertainment budget was $100, food budget was $300. We stopped driving to any little side trips to save on gas. She called around for insurance and we switched to Geico and dropped our monthly bill by $130. She admitted she had been buying a lot of stuff for herself, but she agreed to taper it off, and anything over the $50 personal budget needed to be agreed to by both of us.

So, after all of that here's how we did in Feb:

Me: $35  
Her: $68 (Still over $50, but significantly better than $400, the last $20 that pushed her over the limit was for her to get her eyebrows down)  
Entertainment: $90 (Under budget! Woo!)  
Gas: $150  
Food: $290 (Downside to this is we've practically emptied out our freezer... So this is partially just hiding costs whenever we get around to restocking all the frozen stuff we ate...)  
House: $23 (Bought some light bulbs)  
Misc: $30 (mostly dog stuff)  
Insurance: $77

I made about $6k this month, and she paid herself $2300 for the month from her business account (which is a couple thousand in the black still, and no credit cards by the way). It turns out she's been ""paying herself"" a few thousand from her business every month, but in the past she was basically just paying straight into credit cards or ""reinvesting it in the company"" by buying more stuff (that she doesn't actually need, but that's another issue that we got sorted, and you guys probably don't want to hear about that here). So it wasn't nearly as bad as I has thought it was when looking through our finances last month. She also ordered business checks for the account so that she can pay people straight from there instead of using personal checks and moving the money afterwards.

We saw an accountant near the beginning of the month, and we ended up getting close to $1k back on our taxes.

Thanks to the greatly reduced monthly expenses ($3600 this month compared to over $5k last month) and greatly increased income (over $9k) we were able to put almost $6k towards credit card debt. She had about $2400 on cards between various stores (That were all at a whopping 24.99% interest) that we paid off as quickly as we could, and then we totally paid off the $3500 on the 20.99% card and started chipping away at the $3400 at 16.24%.

We locked up all of the cards except for the 20.99% one, which we're now using for all the day to day purchases (gas, food, entertainment, etc.) because it has the best points. We'll be paying that off monthly so that it doesn't earn another cent of interest.

I made up a spreadsheet to track all the individual credit lines and found that even if I don't make any bonuses for the rest of the year, and my wife only brings in $1k a month (roughly $5k per month), we can still have all of our debts except for the car and the student loans paid off before January 2014.

If we make as much as we made this month, and spend as little as we did (unlikely, this was a really good month) we'll have all the CCs paid off before August, and the car paid off before Jan 2014.

From the suggestions we got:

We have an emergency fund of $1000 set up in a savings account (Not much, I know, it won't even cover the mortgage for a month, but it's better than nothing).

We're keeping the SUV because she really does need a nice car for work. Showing up in a shitty 20 year old truck like some of you were suggesting just wouldn't cut it with her clients and she would probably lose some of them on that fact alone. And finding out that she's bringing in more than 3x the cost of the car plus gas helps lessen the pain as well.

I kept our budget the same for this month as it was for Feb, but I'm expecting food will be back over $300 as we restock the freezer, we also need to do some stuff for the back yard, so that will be a couple hundred, but it's all budgeted for.

Like so many young people, I got into credit trouble while in college.  I got a revolving store charge card at 18 (my first job was at a department store, so as soon as I legally could I got their card) which led to another store charge, and another, and another.  Then the credit card applications started coming in the mail.  Of course I had to get one.

Soon, I was spending completely irresponsibly, racking up thousands in debt, paying only minimum amounts on everything - that is, when I was paying.  I was a severely underemployed university student and had absolutely no right spending that kind of money.  I avoided answering my phone for the  collection calls, dreaded opening the mailbox, you know the drill.  I got to the point where I could recognize an overdraft notice from the bank at a thousand paces.  It was a miserable existence that went on for far longer than it should have.  I admit it - I was stupid.  I didn't get into debt because something bad happened to me.  I made spectacularly awful choices without thinking of the long-term consequences.

My turning point came when my boyfriend got out of me just what kind of situation I was in, and told me that he wouldn't marry someone who was in credit-card debt.  Period.  I knew I had to take some action.

I suppose it would have been easy to declare bankruptcy or beg him to subsidize my recovery.  I knew, however, that there was no reason I couldn't or shouldn't do it myself - I was reasonably employed.   So I used all the common-sense principles - ""Spend less than you make"" - ""Pay off your highest interest debt first"" - stuff like that.  I started living really frugally, and cut up all my store charge cards and all but one of my credit cards.  I dumped all I could into my highest-interest card (which was almost out of control because of all my late payments) and after that was paid off, I moved on to the next one.  Every raise I got, the additional money went to the pile of debt.

In all, it took me four and a half years to pay everything off.  Some days it felt like I would never climb out of the pit I'd dug for myself, but I kept at it.  Finally, two months after I sent off my last payment to my last card, my boyfriend took me to Disneyland to celebrate and proposed in front of the Sleeping Beauty castle.

We've been married for five years now.  All the bad history is finally off my credit report.  I have a savings account, retirement funds, and a small collection of T-bills.  My husband and I should be moving into our new house in a few weeks.  We have enough cash on hand to put down 20% on the house, plus pay the mortgage for six months.  My $23,000+ debt is long gone - the old-fashioned way, through perseverance and sacrifice.

My 800 feels like a trophy I've earned at the end of a very long, very hard race.  Looking back I remember when I thought it was hopeless - things feel so much better now.

For anyone out there struggling with the same thing (crushing debt, not knowing where to start but realizing that you could get yourself out if you apply yourself) - you can do it too.  It takes time and work and all that, but you can do it.",,False,,t5_2qstm,False,,,True,t3_wee99,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/wee99/got_validation_in_the_mail_today_for_me_symbolic/,
1333482952.0,202,self.personalfinance,rrnjk,Can we please stop hating on people with high student loan debt?,292,90,344,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/rrnjk/can_we_please_stop_hating_on_people_with_high/,"It is true that a lot of recent college graduates took out unwisely large student loans for non-lucrative degrees. We all know that. But can we please stop telling them they are stupid?

Yes, we were generally actual adults when we took out these loans, even if just barely, and we therefore have to take adult responsibility for those choices. Yes, many of us chose majors based on what we wanted to do rather than what the market is willing to pay us for. Yes, many of us went to more expensive private schools instead of the less expensive state schools. 

Yes, we were taken in by the prevailing attitude that jobs are abundant, there are plenty of jobs for every major, and even a relatively low paying job will still allow us to comfortably pay back out student loan debt. We got swept up in that attitude, but the idea was not originally ours. Yes, as college-bound high schoolers, perhaps we should have been smart enough to see how wrong that idea was. But we didn't buy into this without the advice of our elders. Many of us asked the adults we respected for advice; we asked our parents, school guidance counselors, teachers, and others for advice on school and major choices. As young adults, many of us did the most responsible thing we could have done in that situation: we recognized that we didn't have sufficient wisdom to make a sound decision on our own, so we got advice from others to help fill in the gaps in our knowledge. If we chose to be very conservative, going to a cheaper school for a career-ready degree, some of the adults around us even tried to dissuade us, suggesting we follow our passions rather than the money. 

Now, once having graduated college into a very different economic landscape than I graduated high school in, I have to face the consequences of borrowing so much money for such useless degree. I made the decision, so, yes, I should pay the consequence. But there were a lot of people around me cheering me on in those decisions I made. Many of those same people now tell me how wrong I was to take out those loans and study that topic. They forget that they were also wrong to advise me the way that they did, but they don't have to live with the consequences of that advice, I do. They also don't have such huge evidence of their overly optimistic view of the economy, whereas my enormous debt serves as very obvious evidence. It is easy for them to forget and deny that they were overly optimistic and blame those stupid pretentious college kids who live so far beyond their means while studying for useless degrees. 

I'm not going to say that I shouldn't have to live with the consequences of my decisions. Still, that doesn't make it okay to insult me for making unwise decisions or to imply that all those college kids made these terrible choices en masse while everyone else knew how bad those choices were. Some people might have seen what so many of us chose to do as risky, and a very few people may have saw these consequences coming, but just like with the housing bubble, most people had an optimistic view of the economic future and our choices seemed more or less sensible in that context.

As for me: I graduated high school at the height of 10 year stint of severe mental illness. My parents advised me to pay for college with 100% private student loans. Illness meant it took me 6 years to graduate. I majored in Humanities because that was what I enjoyed. I attended an academically challenging school, working harder than necessary, for real learning rather than jumping through hoops. I borrowed $86,000. By the time I graduated, in 2008, I owed $106,000. My first job out of college paid $25,000.

**Here's the breakdown....**

Income: $1,834 Per Month Total

Expenses: $1,975 Per Month Total

Credit Cards - $210/month - 15 cards, almost all are 29.99%, all maxed out, $20k in debt, and I had to quit paying six of them last year to keep up with medications and doctor visits. I get about 10 calls a day from collection agencies.

Dr payments - $20/month  - I desperately need to pay them more as I still need followups and they won't see me until I catch up. It would be roughly $100/m, 5k in debt to four doctors, two labs, and three clinics. I've worked with them a lot and had my bills greatly reduced, I really feel like a total dick not paying but a few dollars every month.

Mortgage - $670/month - $84k loan, been here 6 years, owe $74,000. I'm three payments behind and about 2 weeks away from possible foreclosure. It will be $690/month in march because of rising property taxes. I pay almost $50 extra each month in late payments.

Utilities - $353/month - lights ($183, 2 months behind but we keep rolling it over at $2 a month fee), water ($45, again, two months behind), cable &amp; internet ($125, two months behind, our only entertainment budgeted). I have magicjack, so no phone payments. 

Cell phones - $7/month - we use prepay, they are mostly for emergency and it's about $20 every 3 months.

Car payments - $0 - 1999 Ford Ranger, paid off long ago but falling apart. Still runs, but needs $1k in work soon.

Car insurance - $90/month - full coverage.

Gas - $240/month - not pinto beans, for the truck.

Food - $300/month - we coupon almost everything and usually shop at Kroger or Wal-Mart. we don't buy in bulk much, even though we got a deep freezer as a gift last year.

Entertainment - $0/month planned - We do find $10 every couple of months to go grab some cheap burgers or sometimes we'll rent a redbox and watch it together. Overall though we don't spend anything here on a monthly basis.

Life Insurance - $7/month - $50k on me, $25k on wife, $12.5k on son. All accidental.

MISC - $ 78/month -bank fees ($10/m), money for lunch ($10/week), mother's Hulu ($8), mother's Netflix ($8), shampoo, toilet paper, etc. I would like to cut out hulu and netflix, but it would be a war...suggested it before and it did not go well.....


**EDIT: Wow, thank you everyone for the guidance! Words cannot express my gratitude.**

For everyone asking for more info.....

For those asking about my high gas bill, my wife works 6 days a week but she cannot drive (sometimes her legs stop working randomly so it's too dangerous for her to drive). I drive her to and from work, which is four trips per day. On Friday she has to go twice, which is 8 trips total. It adds up quick. Also my mother has a 1992 Chevy APV van that gets pretty bad gas mileage that she drives around town too. All in all we spend about $60 a week on gas. 

I forgot to mention said van, which is also included in the car insurance. It's liability only.

I agree with cutting the cable out, it seems like the best first step. I'll see what I can do, it's another one of those things my mom does not want to give up but we need to do something. We're rural and we only have one provider here and they run a dirtbag monopoly with paid off county officials so I have not been able to switch (except direct tv or dish....which actually cost more than I pay now after the first year). We have the most basic analog cable package they offer and 6mb internet. DSL doesn't come out this far yet, but may in 3-5 more years. I'm praying for Google fiber.

I use Wells Fargo for my banking. It was their free checking package, but now they charge multiple fees...$5 or $6 for something or other, and $3 to $4 for ATM usage (which is usually the only way I bank. I have not even seen a teller in years). 

I looked into our local credit union (we have three around here), but the one I went to (five star credit union I think?) wanted me to have a direct deposit every week and told me all the credit unions around here require a direct deposit. I have nothing to deposit lol.

As far as the electricity, I've always wondered why in the heck our bill was so dang high. We cut stuff off, we run CFL bulbs in everything, we make an effort to keep the power down but it's still so expensive (over $200 in the summer).  We used 1,200kWh last month for a total of $142.69. That seems like a lot. We're on budget billing though, so it's $180-$185 pretty much every month.",,False,,t5_2qstm,1358367396.0,,,True,t3_16owmr,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/16owmr/im_broke_unemployedparttime_for_4_years_25k_in/,

Need Help,249,52,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1fwb2t/81yr_old_grandma_has_135k_in_savings_40kyear/,"So my grandma is 81yrs old and she has about $35k an IRA and she just sold her house which will give her $100k in cash.  We are wondering where to put the 100k.  Her financial consultant recommended 3 dif American Fund Shares

The 'best option' invests in a few different funds such as; American Balanced Fund A, Capital World Growth and Income Fund A, New Perspective Fund A, The Bond Fund of America A, Washington Mutual Investors Fund A.  All these funds charge a flat 5.75% initial investment fee and an operating fee from .6% to .82%.   It seems like me the 5.75% fee is a huge ripoff and should be avoided at all costs. 

 I was talking to my mom and they need this money for my grandma to live off of for as long as possible, and we cant really afford to lose much of it.  Otherwise she goes on government help much sooner than expected and the kids will have to start paying grandma's bills.  

I recomended my mom ask the financial consultant to see what she can offer from vanguard.  But at the same time Im thinking if they cant really afford to lose any of it maybe we are just better off sticking it in a bank account, instead of risking losing some principle for a ~5% gain.

I would very interested to hear what people think about this, or if anyone has been in a situation.

What he basically said was:

* It is better to keep cash long term and wait for the market to have good opportunities than to invest immediately in the best deal you can find.
* Always have cash available for when one of those good deals comes along instead of having your money tied up in something else
* Don't invest ""intrinsically"" in stocks because the stock market is not built for that anymore
* Diversification is for ""suckers"" because you can't be an expert at everything to get a great return on everything. Do your homework on one thing (in his case he bought bonds in Australia) and invest
* You're not going to ""beat"" the stock market because you cannot compete with hedge fund managers/day traders etc.
* Cash in the bank = buy bulk goods for things you know you will need (example given was toiletries) and you have gotten a return on your cash by reducing your budget instead of losing it to interest

I'm finishing up school with a few job offers on the table, and in the process of negotiating salaries I thought it would be good to estimate expenses/desired savings and have a way to visualize what I should be aiming for in terms of salary in order to meet these goals.

1) Put in a base salary and in what % increments you see yourself being able to change this

2) Put in estimated expenses, the spreadsheet will automatically weight these. Put in your savings you with to have per month, as you can see with mine by default I've added some different monthly goals.

3) Output: The spreadsheet will then automatically look at your expenses and in the first table, show you what percentage of your money will be going to each expense and how much of your total salary is going towards expenses.

4) Output #2: The second table includes your desired savings goals. So it will look and immediately take these away from your salary, and then using the weights for expenses it will show you how much you CAN afford for those expenses given your salary and savings goals. 

I hope this will be useful to some of you in figuring out how much you really should be making in order to achieve certain goals while maintaining a certain lifestyle. The only difference between the XLS version and the Gdocs version, is the XLS version will give you green salaries if you are within the ""affordable"" range.

I was able to do it simply because I've been lucky enough to have a decent salary so far. I do not consider myself particularly thrifty/frugal.

Instead, I just wanted to give my personal anecdote about how much better I feel about a potential layoff because of: 1) the emergency fund I've forced myself to maintain and 2) the amount of time and effort I've dedicated to building a detailed forecast *that can be re-forecast easily*. 

Because of this time and effort, I've taken a lot of uncertainty out of the question: ""how long will my emergency fund last?

Here are some screenshots of my Excel forecast's ""Summary Chart"" (dollars redacted but the bottom line = $0) assuming:

1. Continued employment: http://i.imgur.com/D6ykyed.jpg
2. A layoff tomorrow: http://i.imgur.com/kcTDYBW.jpg

I was able to create scenario 2 by simply deleting my salary and replacing it with expected unemployment benefits and adding estimated costs of COBRA.

I didn't do it yet, but I know I could make further adjustments for cutting cable/cell phones, selling my car, buying cheaper groceries, etc. 

While a layoff will still really suck, I at least know I should be able to comfortably make it until next summer without changing any of my spending/savings habits.

For those interested, my Excel budget consists of:

1. a tab tracking historical liquid/non-retirement monetary assets every half-month

2. a tab tracking future income/expenses by half-month including the regulars (like my and spouse's income, bills, gas, groceries, gifts, dog food, doctors appointments, etc) as well as the unusual items (like bonuses, tuition payments, etc).

I also maintain a tab tracking historical accuracy and true up my future estimates from time to time.

I conducted a survey on personal finance on five different subreddits a couple of weeks ago, but personal finance was the only subreddit to get the post to the front page so the vast majority of my respondents were from here. Big shocker, right? Sorry it took so long to get this out—I just bought a house and all of my free time has been fixing leaks and painting walls, but here are the results. This is the second big survey I’ve done on reddit, so while I’m much better at this than I was for the first survey, I’m still learning about the best way to go about things, and about statistics in general. I don’t proclaim to be some amazing statistician, I’m just a student. I know reddit loves to tear people’s methods down, and while I’d love to hear your suggestions do try to be nice! 

I did a lot of statistical analysis using SAS, most of the data manipulation and graph-making were done in Excel. I started the write-up discussing the methodology and the exact tests used to come up with my conclusions, but it ended up being 5 pages before I was even half way done so I decided to take a lot of the statistical mumbo jumbo out. If you have any questions on how I got the results I did I will be more than happy to supply you with everything you need

First, [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmB6E2D1lngXdFNZNVotenJDWkYzSjVkdnlrbVhjS0E) is a link to a GDoc of the raw data. All of the data is there. For questions about income and net worth, I took out 4σ outliers (Basically, the top and bottom 4 or so). If you want me to do any analysis for questions, maybe if one is correlated with another for example, let me know here and I’ll try to do it. If you want to edit the data, file -&gt; download as. If the file is all weird because of the GDocs conversion, let me know and I'll upload the original excel file. 

Descriptive statistics:

The average age of the respondent was 26.09, with a standard deviation of 5.34. The oldest person to respond was 60 years old. The youngest among us? 13. Compare this to my last big reddit survey (Surveyed AskReddit mostly) where the age mean and stdev were 22.22 and 8.1 respectively. Statistically speaking, the difference between the two samples is not significant.  

[There were over 40 majors recorded](http://i.imgur.com/JBzvj.png). 20 majors had at least five people in them. The five most popular majors are:   
5) Computer Engineering – 16  
4) Finance – 19  
3) Engineering – 20  
2) Electrical Engineering – 21  
1) Computer science – 53  

Yes, I am aware that “Engineering” is an umbrella term, but not including it would skew the data. If you’re curious for the next highest, not including engineering, it is Economics with 14 people. 

The proportion of males who answered this survey is 75.2%. The average net worth of the respondent was $92,346, but answers ranged from $-500,000 to $2,000,000. Interesting note, the $-500,000 respondent would have bought the brand new car of the three options: The same response as the $2,000,000 net worth respondent (Not so surprising). The proportion of people who had taken a personal finance class is 21.9%. 

The majority (81%) of respondents found the survey on personalfinance. The average respondent was subscribed to 2 of the following finance related subreddits. The following is also the percentage of respondents who said they subscribed to the respective subreddits:

    personalfinance 81%
    frugal          55%
    thrifty          6%
    tax              4%
    realestate      10%
    investing       33%
    economy         12%

More than 51% of respondents spend less than 20% of their income on housing. Unfortunately, I believe a large portion of these people either live with their parents or have their housing subsidized, thus making any analysis done with the household expense data incredibly biased. 

If they had to keep one luxury and cut back your lifestyle in other places, 28% of respondents would keep their smart phones. 20% of people would keep on eating out. 7% for cable TV. 10 people said they’d keep Netflix, but no one said they’d keep Hulu! 

The average response to “How savvy with your finances are you?” was a 7. 

Here are some more graphs I created but did not use for any tests:

[Income range histogram](http://i.imgur.com/O2Mp0.png)  
[Net worth range histogram](http://i.imgur.com/NwKJP.png)  
[Net worth vs age according to ""Emergency fund"" response](http://i.imgur.com/2u57vh.png)

Analysis:

**Is a high income correlated linearly with net worth?**

The income ranges were broken into 11 categories and numbered from 1 to 11. These are *not* interval markings, because the difference between any two numbers may not be the same-- but they are ordinal. Because of this, net worth was able to be modelled with a generalized linear regression model. For the data, 1 = the $0-$6,999 income range. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/QQhOg.png) is a graph of the data. The problem is that there is a ton of noise in the data, even with such a large sample size. While income range is statistically significant in determining net worth, only 12% of the variability in the data can be explained by this model. Really, any numerical analysis I can get out of this model will largely be guesswork. However, for those curious: with no income, the model estimates your net worth will be $-63,369 and for every income range jump, the estimated net worth increases by $18,168.

**Is it more acceptable to attempt higher degrees in one field than the others?**

At the 99% significance level, the proportions of people who agree or strongly agree to the statement “Higher degrees in X make no financial sense” are different, for all X (Liberal arts, business, and sciences). 54% of people agree or strongly agree that higher degrees in liberal arts make no financial sense, as opposed to just 8.8% of people who say the same about business degrees and 3.7% of people who say the same about science degrees.

**Is there statistical dependence on the use of a budget and money being a major factor of stress in one’s life?**

These two questions were asked using a Likert scale, with responses from strongly disagrees to strongly agree. Respondents giving no opinion were discarded from the sample. The remaining responses were stratified into binary results, with strongly disagree and disagree being condensed to one answer: “No”, and likewise for agree and strongly agree into “Yes”. After stratification, we had a sample size of 356. A contingency table was created as follows: [Click!](http://i.imgur.com/tuTiY.png). A test of association was conducted, and it is concluded that no association exists between “I use and stick to a budget”, and “Money is a large factor of stress in my life.” 

This one is actually very interesting-- I really thought they'd be a high correlation between these two. I took the original question and placed answerers into one of four groups:

1.	People who stick to a budget and don’t believe money is a major factor of stress in their lives  
2.	People who stick to a budget and do believe money is a major factor of stress in their lives  
3.	People who don’t stick to a budget and don’t believe money is a major factor of stress in their lives.  
4.	People who don’t stick to a budget and do believe money is a major factor of stress in their lives.  

I believed, and hoped to prove through analysis, that people who create budgets would have less stress about money than people who don’t create budgets. Just looking at the raw data, we see some interesting things. 

First, the proportion of people who budget is consistent across stress levels. Putting numbers to it, 63% of people who don’t have stress budget, and 69% of people who do have stress budget. With the sample size we had, this is not a statistically significant difference in proportion.  

Second, my theory was that there would be the vast majority of people in either the “I do budget and don’t stress” or the “I don’t budget and do stress” categories. However, those two categories combined only make up 52% of the total sample, and a large portion of that is due to larger percentage of all people who budget. 

Third, my original hypothesis seems to be debunked. Looking at the percentage of people who have stress across the budget groups, we see that 26% of people who don’t budget have stress, but 32% of people who do budget have stress. Like in the first point, at a significant level of 95% this is not a statistically significant. 

tl;dr: Everything about this data screams independence of the two questions. Budgeting plays no role in money being a large factor of stress in one’s life. 

**Let’s model the choice of cars as a function of all possible variables, and use stepwise techniques to eliminate insignificant variables.**

A logistic model was set up using the variables: Choice of car = Income, net worth, “I consider myself generally frugal”, age, housetype, finance savviness, and “I have taken a personal finance class”. Using stepwise regression, it is found that all of the variables are statistically insignificant except for age and frugality. 

It is found, unsurprisingly, that as a person agrees more to “I consider myself generally frugal,” they are more likely to pay for a car in cash. In fact, a person who strongly disagrees with this statement is more than three times less likely to choose the cash-only 2006 car than someone who strongly agrees with this statement. The relatively surprising thing is that as age increases, people are more likely to buy a car with cash. In fact, a person age 30 is 60% more likely to pay cash for a car than a person age 20.

1375284201.0,185,self.personalfinance,1jfbtb,Wife's friend who is terrible with money wants to add my wife to a bank account. Give me reasons why not...,266,81,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1jfbtb/wifes_friend_who_is_terrible_with_money_wants_to/,"Ok, so my wife has a friend who is Bi-Polar. One of the common traits of a bi-polar is going on overspending binges. She's been in lots of trouble financially and her husband has now effectively cut her off from dealing with pretty much any of the household finances. She works just a little bit and he's ""letting"" her open up her own separate bank account to keep her money and mange it how she needs for groceries and stuff for the kids. (we won't get into how fucked up their relationship is). So....she asked my wife to be put onto this new account she's opening up. I'm not sure exactly what their logic behind this is. As I understand it, it's mostly because the two of them constantly owe each other money for one thing or another. Just little bits here and there. One of them might have picked up the tab for lunch, one might have picked up something at the store for the other, whatever. Personally, I don't see why they even bother keeping tabs on who owes what since they seem to pretty much go back and forth so much they probably break even enough to not care about the difference between friends...but that's irrelevant. Anyways...I think she also sort of wants my wife to ""help"" her keep her shit straight with this account, but I'm not really sure. Oh, and I think she's keeping the account (or at least the fact that my wife would be on it) a secret from her husband. She's had credit cards in secret since he cut her off too. (He doesn't let her have any CCs either) None of our money would be going into this account, it would all be strictly from her, and would give her a way to ""pay back"" my wife easier...supposedly. But I'm having a hard time accepting this. I'm having trouble envisioning exactly HOW this could go bad, but I know there is something that doesn't sit right with me about this. Can any of you wise folks help me get some good reason to tell her not to do this aside from ""this doesn't feel right""?

**TLDR;** My wife's friend wants to put my wife on her account. I don't feel comfortable with it, but I have no solid reason that I can explain. Can you guys give me a good reason?

Edit: For the sake of clarity, the stated plan was that this account would have no overdraft ability, so if the money ain't there, then the card gets declined. No way that I'm aware of for the bank to come after her for anything or otherwise affect her/our credit if there is no overdraft, right?

Edit2: Another point of clarification as mentioned below. I'm almost positive that I'll veto this idea, I'm just looking for a good solid reason to present logically other than just ""This sounds like a terrible idea""...which it does...

Edit 3: Ok. I'm think I'm a little more rationally armed to disarm this whole concept. I knew it was a terrible idea, but was having trouble verbalizing it when it was presented last night. Probably because I had too many other things on my mind at the time. Most of the things pointed out here were pretty obvious and were sort of in my head but needed you guys to pull them all the way out. :)

Edit 4: OK OK...I got it. It's a terrible idea and I was an idiot for even thinking of not saying no to this. I knew there was really no upside, but for some reason I was having mental breakdowns and couldn't articulate why this was so terrible. 

Edit 5: **UPDATE**: Ok. Last edit. I've already talked with the wife. It's not happening. I gave her just a few examples of reasons why not and she didn't argue with any of them. She simply hadn't thought of it that way. We can try to find other ways to help her. Wife wants to do lunch with the friend so we can talk to her about it...basically, so I can be the bad guy and tell her no. I'm ok with that. Bottom line: I don't need you guys to keep telling me not to do it. I already got it. I knew that going in...I just needed help with some reasons. Thanks for all the input. I know you guys are just looking out for me.

A while back, [I asked r/personalfinance](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/10gfk3/im_a_nonsales_cfp_considering_setting_up_a_free/) if there was any value in creating a personal finance podcast geared towards this community and others who are new to personal finance.

[momoru](http://www.reddit.com/u/momoru) and I have spent the last few weeks recording, editing, and submitting our podcast for consideration on iTunes, and it was accepted!  [You can find it here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/we-make-money-easy/id580834716).  Or search the iTunes podcast directory for ""We Make Money Easy."" 

Again, the purpose was to answer some of the more common questions that get asked in this subreddit, from the perspective of two financial wonks that aren't trying to sell people funds or insurance.  Also, to pull back the curtain on some of the industry practices we disagree with.

We want to be supportive of the personal finance community, and keep this podcast going.  If you're down with that, we'd ask for a few things:

1) Send us your questions!  You can reach us via @wemakemoneyeasy on Twitter or by e-mail  - wemakemoneyeasy@gmail.com. Please be as specific as you can. We're always happy to answer, and we'll make sure to respond and let you know when your question will be addressed in future recordings.

2) Give us your feedback.  Our goal was to keep the tone light and conversational, and to try to stay away from industry jargon and concepts that can turn laypeople off.  But we can only know how good a job we're doing if you tell us.  Also, we're bound to make mistakes, so we're happy to accept corrections and address them right away.

3) Tell people.  If you have friends/family/colleagues that could use this info, ask them to listen.  Our long-term goal is to shift power away from the financial industry and towards the consumer.  We're not here to give advice, but we DO want to make sure people have a more equal balance of information when dealing with banks, investment companies, and insurance companies.

4) Tell us what you want to hear. If you need to know more about automating your personal finances, for example, or buying your first home, or consolidating debt, then tell us.  The only way for us to know what we should be researching and talking about on the podcast is for you to give your suggestions.

5) Rate us.  A 5-star rating is great and raises our profile.  If your rating is lower, we'd appreciate knowing what we could do better.

Thanks for your suggestions and support so far. We're pretty psyched about the whole thing, and look forward to working with the r/personalfinance community.

Longer version - we save a crap-load of money towards retirement, low-cost index funds. That is, our assets are highly diversified.

Owning doesn't strike relevant chords with me, but FI does. That is, the point of saving for retirement is to have an earlier date when we no longer have to work for a wage.

We've been renters, but I wonder if owning could be wiser. Here are the pluses and minuses as I understand them:

* Renting gives flexibility -- we could move to portland tomorrow.
* Renting is lower-risk - if the house burns down, we get a new place.

* Buying makes our total portfolio greatly non-diversified. Instead of having most of our money in index funds, most of our money would be in a single piece of real-estate.
* Buying means in 15-30 years, no more rent. We can sell it and buy another one, and maintain our established equity.
* Buying has tax deduction implications.

Seems like for the short-run bet, its always rent. But for a long-term bet and for FI, buying becomes optimal. What'm I missing? Does buying allow a leverage superpower?",,False,,t5_2qstm,False,,,True,t3_1kcidd,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1kcidd/eli5_renting_versus_buying/,

After a huge blow up about finances by my husband, he finally revealed just how bad it is.

**$75, 600**

My hands are shaking typing that.

After pulling up our credit report, I saw we have 5 credit cards which were all opened between 2009-2011 and  we have *never* been late with a payment.

However, due to many circumstances, the most recent being an 8 month period of being unemployed and now being underemployed, we are now living paycheck to paycheck and have resorted to using credit cards to pay for things like gas so we can pay our monthly bills.  This is the first time in years we have added to the debt.


Our mortgage is $1,144/month.
Revolving credit minimum payment of $1,396/month.

Interest on cards:
AE 13.24%
Upromise 12.4%
Capital One 7.15%
Chase 13.24%
Citicard 13.24% (on $7,856)
and 28.4% (on $3,174)- don't understand why it would be 2 rates?

The cards are maxed out and we cannot keep this up and I don't know what our alternatives are.

There were times over the years I was unemployed due to two difficult pregnancies- both with preemies.  The last pregnancy was with unexpected twins requiring me to be on bed rest and the babies in NICU for 2 months.

We have been on a vacation once in our 16 year marriage and hardly ever eat out, or even go out, for that matter.

We have used money for home remodeling and send our children to private school due to the horrific conditions of our public school.
This is the last year for our oldest- who will be going to public high school next year. The twins have 2 more years until they go to public high school.

After a tearful conversation with my husband, I now realize we are sinking and can't live with this debt any longer.
I am now seeking a second job.

I have set up an appointment to speak with a non-profit debt counselor, and have tried calling the CC companies myself- they won't go any lower with the interest rates, because to them we are ""good customers"" since we have always made our payments on time.

Reviewing our statements- we have paid most of the principal on this debt and are now being crushed by compounding interest.

This is not my husband's fault and I am not blaming him.  Due to issues with postpartum depression and lingering depression, he has tried bringing this up over the years- but I would shut him down due to my mental state and inability to cope.

**What can we do now?**
I am now fully awake to this situation. While I can't change the past, I want to move forward without this monster over our heads.
Please, any advice is very appreciated.

**TL;DR- $75,600 of credit card debt and now can't keep paying our monthly living expenses without being late on the credit card payments**

**edit to add:**
**Total monthly income (net)=  $6,300**

Monthly Expenses:
*Mortgage- $1,144;
*Revolving credit- $1,396;
*School- $800 (3 more months only, then will resume at 550 in September); 
*Bills (oil, water, electric,...)-$400; 
*gasoline- at least $100; 
*Internet and 2 phones (we have cancelled cable a year ago)- $150;
*Food- not sure (we always eat in) ;
*Property tax- $680
*Car Tax- not sure
*Car insurance- not sure
*Home insurance- not sure
*other- not sure.
*Life insurance- $60

My wife's family is just as bad with spending money as soon as the get it, but they are not in debt. They are just always broke. So a bit better.

I am 22. I have no debt. I paid off a loan of 15k for a car at the beginning of the year. I have a decent job making ~50k.

We are planning on purchasing a house at the end of the year.

I have a budget that I try to stick to mostly, but I am in debt to myself about $1000 (my over spending on my personal spending category...).

Now here is why I am posting. My wife and I are about to come into, let's call it an early unexpected inheritance, of the low 7 figures.

I am lost. I have no earthly idea what to do. I am afraid it will screw us up instead of help us financially. I don't know anything about investing, or anyone who does. I am somewhat happy, but I am mostly freaking out.

How do I even start? Do I buy the house outright? Do I get that new couch and bed we have been saving for? Do I lock it all away and don't touch it?

No one knows about this except my wife and her parents. (Her parents will also be getting lots of money).

I am lost. I have no guidance, and frankly I don't even know if this is the place to post this.

I have been sitting on this information for a week and I am just scared. My wife is happy and excited and that is freaking me out even more.

Help?

I have itemized my roommates and my receipts for the six months, January through June of this year, by category. We are three single guys in our 20s. We consider we eat pretty healthy and probably do eat healthier than almost all single guys in their 20's.

Some observations:

 - Average of $90/person, per month
 - We have guests over frequently
 - We have fruit/vegetables often
 - We shop most of the time based on, ""what's a good deal?"" especially fresh produce
 - We live in the midwest
 - We feel we eat quite luxuriously and normally cook our own meals
 - We make our own bread often
 - We buy in bulk at Sam's Club and when items are on sale (meat especially is almost always bought on sale). We bought 30 boxes of brownie mix @ $0.99 a box because it's normally $2.50 and we use this somewhat often...
 - Chicken/pork are considerably cheaper than beef
 - Discounted ""about to ~~go bad~~ be used"" bread/vegetables can be great deals -- especially bread, since you can freeze it

Here is a [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjZpOZeHcTWPdHB5LWF0Z3gzRU5IV2pEeE9oMzBiTFE&amp;usp=sharing) to a google doc. There are also two levels of categories, one more detailed than the other. Almost all the frozen food we buy is frozen vegetables.

Feel free to ask questions. Hopefully this is helpful to someone trying to save money on food.


**EDIT**
I am fully aware location affects food cost. Most cost of living calculators put where I'm at about 20-25% cheaper for groceries than NYC/SF/DC. Apparently Texas is almost 10% cheaper than here, somehow.

The key factors however for low food costs are the above list. Simply being very aware of your food cost when eating/purchasing food and consistently finding solid sales can make a large difference.

This isn't to suggest this sort of budget will allow you to keep your current eating style and just magically reduce your food costs.

I come from a really, really low income background. Raised by a single mom who worked a min wage job. No higher ed in our family, everyone I knew ended up in the factory or the military or mostly in jail. Somehow, I escaped this crazy life, worked my ass off in college for 6 years, and just yesterday got offered a job at my dream company with a salary of around 90k. (maybe some of you won't consider this ""riches"" but it is unfathomable to me). The most I have ever made was $1100 a month (what I'm making right now), and when I started this current job I felt I was rolling in cash. No complaints. I love my life and I""m completely comfortable. I have 0 debt and still save.


I am very private about my finances. I live a simple life and I""m very frugal and I feel I make wise decisions. For example, college. I never paid a single dime for college. Through PELL grants, scholarships, and assistanceships, I got out of 6 years of college with 0 debt. The opposite actually. I started working at 15 and now I""m 25 and over those years I've managed to save 30k. No one knows I have this money and it's away in a CD that I started at age 18 that matures every year and I just let it roll over. I've never touched that money and I act like it's not there. I have one credit card which I pay off in full each month. I've never once carried a balance on it. I've never paid my bills late. I've been able to do this because I just don't buy things. There's not a lot I want.


Once I start this job, I don't want to go out and buy a car or a smart phone or things like that. I have an old beater that I paid for in cash years ago that I plan to drive until the wheels fall off. I'm happy with my ghetto $20 /month old flipphone. I don't own a television cus I don't watch TV, and I don't think that'll change. I just don't want stuff like that. But I do have two things I'm interested in doing and I am looking for advice on those


1) My mom is about 60k in debt right now and I want to pay it off for her. SHe's just slave to this debt, she makes so little at her job that she can only make minimum payments and the interest is so much it just never goes away. I haven't told her i""m gonna pay it off yet (I haven't even told her I got offered the job). Is it best to just pay it all at once? How do I do it? Luckily for me I set her up on all online accounts recently so I have access to all her accounts and could do it in secrecy.


2) I am wondering if I should buy a condo. The one big money dream I guess I always had was owning a piece of property, but I don't want a house. If I buy a condo I could either live in it myself or rent it out I suppose. I'm just trying to figure out if that's something that's feasible with a 90k salary in California, or if it's wise because the real estate market is so shitty and what not. My other option is I can just rent an apartment. Here's the thing though, I have lived in the hood pretty much my whole life. I just don't even want to live in some big fancy apartment. So if I rent an apartment, I'm just gonna look for another cheap place in a crappy neighborhood. I don't know why. Maybe that's what I know and that's where I feel comfortable. So given that this is my alternative, is it wiser to invest, or just stick with a shitty apt in a shitty neighborhood?


Other than that does anyone have any advice? SHould I hire a financial consultant (do those exist for individuals, are they worth it?) Or an accountant of some sort? I grew up below the poverty line, I'm still under it now, and pretty much everyone I know is. So I Just can't ask them for advice. I just don't know what to do with that much money. There are only 8 pairs of clothes in my closet, I only have two pairs of shoes. I can't comprehend this yet. Do you know any good books that can help me out? Are there any common mistakes people make when they first make money? I feel I know the basics - when I got my CD years ago I read about IRAs and 401k and stuff like that. SHould I Just go crazy and get it all - or should I Just keep adding to my CD?

No seriously, a BEGINNER-beginner.",218,40,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/117lsw/where_does_a_beginner_start_no_seriously_a/,"I grew up in poverty.  Not because my parents weren't good with money, mind you.  My parents are amazingly frugal and do amazingly well with what they have.  But they weren't born into money by any means; and both had a string of misfortune (parents dying at young ages, businesses they worked for failing, injuries, etc) that basically left us at the bottom of the middle class, at our best times.

Now, growing up this way, I definitely learned how to stretch a dollar.  I am frugal to the point of being a cheapskate; I know how to get good deals and use coupons and anything else I can do to save a buck.  I never spend money on anything that's not absolutely necessary.  I'm not in debt, even though I did have to pay off a lot of medical bills due to not having insurance.  I'm damn good with money - I can stretch my meager 21k salary further than most anyone else can with three times that.  (Yes only 21k - thanks to the economy collapsing right as I got out of college, there are no jobs in my field and my skillset was limited aside from that.  I'm working on it.)

So I've got that part down.  My problem is that growing up the way I did, I never had any sort of education about things like 401ks and retirement plans.  My parents will never be able to retire; they don't have a 401k or any of that, so they never bothered to tell me about it.  I don't even know how much I should shoot to save for retirement, when I could think about possibly retiring, or where to put the money when I start saving it.

I try to Google this stuff and I get lost in the terminology and finance-speak that I was never educated on.  I feel like all of these websites are targeted towards upper-class businessmen who have worked in such things already, and already know all the terms and what-not.  I don't know any of it.  I feel very backwoods hillbilly blue collar at this point, I'm embarrassed to be so ignorant.

So I'm asking you guys.  Does anyone know of a good place to start?  I mean for someone that really knows NOTHING about this stuff.  Seriously, remember that I don't even know how a 401k works; I was taught that it was something meant for those white-collar folk in their big wig jobs, so I shouldn't bother knowing.  Seriously, I'm the beginner-est of the beginners.  So I need a verrry basic tutorial.

I got an email from a buddy yesterday.  He has a bunch of accounts in collections and has been dealing with a collection agency in our home town.  He wanted to check with me before he went and paid the settlement they offered.  I’m glad he did.  He’s kind of dumb and I honestly think he was going to just walk in to their office and pay with cash.  Since I see questions here on PF about “dealing with debt collectors” just about every day, I thought I’d copy and paste a redacted version of my response for all to enjoy. 

*Side Note: I told my friend I was going to post this to reddit.  His responses were; a) What is reddit? b) Well surprise surprise Mr. Ego.  Nobody asked but you’re still going to explain how you know everything.* 

*Fuck him…  I do know everything…  I’m sending him a link to lemonparty.org at work tomorrow.*

Anyway…  My response

While, in theory, you should be able to just pay the collector in cash and be done with this forever, it’s probably better to take a few extra steps to protect yourself.  Since you mentioned that you’ve got other debts to settle, here are three very simple steps even you can remember:

1-	Get it in writing (the terms),

2-	Get confirmation of payment,

3-	Keep copies of everything.

It sounds like they sent you an offer letter, that’s good.  You want an offer letter w/ proof of payment or a confirmation letter.  A confirmation letter is more convenient because it has everything you need in one document (statement of payment/settlement in full plus a confirmation of payment received), but you don’t usually get one of those until AFTER you’ve paid and you’re kind of screwed if they forget to send one.  Regardless, as long as you have terms and confirmation of payment, it’s all good.   

**Terms:**

Some debts get around (like your sister).  They get sold from one creditor to another.  You something to prove that you paid this in case another collector shows up later trying to collect the same debt.  When a debtor tells me that the debt I’m trying to collect has already been paid or settled, here is what I ask for and what I think you need in your writing to prove the debt has been paid.

1-	Amount &amp;amp;amp;amp; Settlement Language (Pay in full, settle in full, etc…) 

Something telling me you made a payment isn’t good enough.  If your account had a $5000 balance and you paid $2500, all I know is that you paid $2500.  I don’t know that the creditor agreed to accept $2500 as a settlement.  You’re looking for something that says they want $2500 “as settlement in full,” “to settle your account,” “to pay your account in full,” etc…

2-	Identification of the Debt.

Telling me you paid “your account” or “your [bank] account” doesn’t help me.  You might have 3 accounts with that creditor.  How do I know which one was paid?  The two big things to look for are the name of the creditor and the original account number.  (*Note: They told him they only have an internal reference number.*) I don’t buy that bullshit that they don’t have the account number.  If it came from a bank, (credit cards, checking overdraft accounts, auto loans, student loans, etc…) it has an account number.  How the fuck were they planning to sue you if you didn’t pay?

Even if a collector bought the debt, they should still be able to identify the original creditor and the account number.  If it’s not a bank account, you can get something descriptive.   Look for something that identifies the creditor and the goods or service(s) provided.  You mentioned you have some medical debt.  In those cases you can have them attach the account statement to the letter and include something like “the attached statement” or something like that in the letter.

Here are some examples that might apply to you:

* American Express Card No. xxxxxxxxxx1234, 
* [Auto Body Shop], parts/labor to make you look like an even bigger douche in your POS Hundai, VIN XXXXX2121.
* Porn Warehouse Significant Spanker Account No. xxxxxxxxxx1234,  
* Hundai Motor Credit Account No. xxxxxx12345, 
* Office Visit, April 1, 2011, Dr. Feelgood,
* Office Visit, April 2, 2011, Dr. Jellyfinger,
* Facility Charge, Our Lady of Perpetual Rehab, Date(s) of Service April 1 through 10, 2000.
  
3-	The Settlement Deadline (if any).

The letter you got should have a due date or say something like “within 30 days.”  Most offers are only good for a limited period of time and if you fail to pay before a certain date, the offer is void.  People call me all the time saying they paid (or settled) a debt.  Then they send me a copy of their settlement letter something showing that they paid about 6 months late.  A payment of $2500 on May 1, 2013 does not settle an account if the offer was to settle for $2500 on or before December 1, 2012.  If they got it a day late or didn’t cash it fast enough, we could argue with them but if you’re way off, you’re SOL.  

4-	Identification of the Collector/Creditor.

The offer or confirmation letter has to be from the collector.  I had a guy claim that he had already paid one of my [major bank] accounts and he sent me letter from his accountant.  That’s like getting a letter from the dry cleaner saying you paid your milk man (which you should do because you don’t want your milk man pissed off).  The easy way to deal with this is to make sure the letter is on the collector’s letterhead (if it isn’t, let me know because something is VERY suspicious).
  
5-	Other Terms/Promises

I don’t know what specifics you’ve worked out but if it’s important to you, get it in the writing.  It doesn’t matter if they promised to delete the item from your credit report, dismiss a lawsuit, buy you that pony you’ve always wanted or stop dating your mom; if it’s not in the letter, it isn’t going to happen. 

**Confirmation of Payment:**

I know you struggle with all things financial but this is simple; Get a letter from the collector confirming that you paid (confirmation letter) or pay in a way that allows you to prove that you paid.  Ya…  Just in case you are wondering, cash is almost never traceable.  On the other hand, checks, debit cards, money orders, and credit card charges typically are traceable.  It doesn’t matter how you can trace the payment, you just need to make sure you’ve got proof of: 

1-	When payment was made (See: *Settlement Deadline* above),
2-	How much was paid (See: *Amount* above), 
3-	To whom the payment was made (See: *Identification of the Collector/Creditor* above).

I’d pay with a check and then get a copy of the cashed check (front AND back) from your bank.  A bank or credit card statement will work too if it shows who got paid (because the date and amount are already on there).  If you’re going to do a money order or a cashier’s check, ask how you get confirmation of payment and follow the instructions.  

*Note for Reddit: I can tell you what DOES NOT work.  A copy of a letter sent via certified mail claiming to have made payment.  Even if I assume there was a check in the envelope, there is nothing showing that my client got paid.  You could have canceled the check, the check could have bounced or my client could have rejected the payment.  People on here make a lot of noise about certified mail.  Remember, all certified mail proves is that you sent something.  It doesn’t prove what you sent or what happened before or after you sent it.* 

**Keep Records:**

I don’t know how to elaborate on this.  Keep copies.  You have an entire fucking room full of comic books; you can keep a couple of folders with this shit in them.  If you’re opposed to keeping paper copies, scan them and save them in the same place you keep all of your porn.  If that’s too much, get a sky drive account or a USB thing.  

You mentioned that you “think” you paid one of the accounts off.  I have some bad news.  If you don’t have a record of it, you’re SOL.    

**EDIT:** My buddy said that the collector told him he HAD to pay cash so I called to talk to the collector for him this morning. 

In this case I told him it's probably ok to pay cash. The collector has to have certified funds before the 27th so it HAS to be cash or a cashier's check AND they will have a Paid in Full letter waiting for him when he gets there. He had them fax me a copy of the paid in full letter and it has everything he needs.

So I have an app that I have been using since 2008 where I am able to meticulously follow my expenditures, and sort by types, etc. You hand input everything, but I like it because it becomes like a game of sorts where you are trying to minimize expenditures, etc. It has really helped me save a ton. 


Anyway, I have enough time, (~4 years now), and I basically spend about $500-$600 / month on food. 'Food' here means food I buy from restaurants, subway, whatever. It does not include groceries since I almost never buy them. (Single dude here living in a bach pad).


I am curious as to what everyone spends on food, including groceries etc. My plan for this year is to really learn how to cook because I believe that I can cut down this amount by a good chunk if I cook at home.

Previous thread: http://redd.it/1ax3lc (2nd)

This thread is an update to an update to an update, if that make sense. Just a quick re-cap of the previous threads is that I was in $34,000 debt as of December 31, 2012. I got in that much debt due to paying for my sisters wedding, student loan, spending money on my sisters wedding. When I posted the first thread, I had reduced my debt down to $22,500. By the second update, my total debt was $21,191.38. Which brings us today and this thread. I'm happy to announce that my total debt is now **$18,000**, down from **$34000** at the beginning of the year. 

This is not quite the halfway mark of the original debt of $34K but I'm very, very close. My by-weekly salary is $2000 and I got some money on tax return. I've have been living like a poor sap for the last 4 months to pay off as much of the debt as I can before my first child, a son is born, in mid-July. Between now and mid-July, I'll earn $12,000. I'm hoping to pay $8000 toward debt and keep the $4000 on hand to do all the baby-shopping, food, family, etc. I know I'm cutting it close, especially without an emergency fund. I have a 401K I can cash out if I *really, really* have to do it.

I felt trapped and just told them to ship the item rather than just throwing $400 away and not getting anything in return. The item was being shipped via FedEx Freight and I called them this morning to schedule an appointment. I explained the situation to them and asked them how much it actually cost to ship. They said they couldn't tell me the exact number because of their pricing contract but could say that $450 was more than double the actual shipping amount. I called my cr cd company to see if it was possible to dispute the shipping charge since they advertised it as free shipping and then essentially lied about the shipping cost. I ordered an item that was $708 so $450 was more than half of the item itself! They said I don't have a case since I told them to continue with the order. Is there any other way I can fight this or dispute it? Company has 19 complaints with BBB and horrible reviews online. I know it was my mistake for ordering with them in the first place but since that can't be changed, just looking for ideas to rectify the situation, if possible. 

I also contacted the company today to tell them I had a copy of the FedEx receipt that shows the shipping charges were significantly less than $450 and in fact was &lt;$200...customer service rep said ""it could have been a simple mistake, I will e-mail my supervisor and get back to you"" of course no response yet.

I got my learner's permit at age 16. For a variety of reasons, I didn't have a car regularly. I decided to get my license at age 20 (had some availability of a car, although I wasn't the primary driver by far). I wasn't insured individually because I was covered under incidental use under my family policy (i.e. quick trips to the supermarket once a week).

I'm 21, going on 22, graduating, and now I'm shopping for car insurance (need to drive to work).

**And my rates suck.** Every insurer asks when you were first licensed (learner's permit doesn't count), some ask the month and day you got the license too. They don't care how much driving experience you've had, this is just a factor. It's more than double (closer than triple at most insurers!) per year for the same coverage.

It's tough to get a break already as a young male under 25 (risky bracket). My credit score has helped cut my rates as is having no violations, college grad, etc...  but licensing late has killed me. 

By the way, shop around - in my case GEICO is ~$900/6mo (albeit I bumped up some coverage). Same coverage at State Farm? $2400/6mo Allstate? $1700/6mo. Progressive? $950/6mo (potentially more if I opt for the snapshot discount, although I have reservations about that). Other insurers are all over the map.

However, this changes ENTIRELY when the car changes from something considered a sedan (Camry) to a *sports sedan* (Maxima). Prices increase at least 40% all around, and GEICO becomes far from the cheapest.

I've been told to shop again in a year and if my insurer comes ahead ask them to run my credit (soft inquiry) if it's improving (it should due to age).

&gt;I think this is a dangerous idea for several reason. For one, the long-term real return of stocks is no longer 7%. Thanks to two giant market crashes in less than a decade, the long-term number has fallen to 6.67% (that’s since 1925). Furthermore, much of that gained comes from the post-war boom. Over that last 50 years, that real return has been a much more reasonable 5.45%.

I think the takeaway is that many assumptions we have about expected returns may be way off, and it's important to save as much as you can, as early as you can. Plugging in an 8% expected return into a ""How much should you save every year for retirement"" calculator, and then thinking you're doing enough,  could leave you in a world of hurt.

I have no idea what to do, so I'll just get right into explaining my situation. Please, *please*, refrain from reminding me of how bad I messed up. I know. I'm just trying to figure out what to do now, and I'm terrified.

I'm 26 years old, about $110,000 in student loan debt, working three jobs to make payments (barely), and living with my parents because I can't afford to move out. I went to college for music performance. I went to grad school (for free) and got a Masters in music performance, as well. The undergraduate degree, however, I pretty much paid for 100% in loans. After college, I tried to find a job using my degrees, but due to the nature of the field, I wasn't able to find anything steady. I therefore had to take a factory job working an assembly line for about minimum wage. On top of that, I had to drive an hour just to get there. I've since gotten another job in a call center to which I only drive 9 miles one way. It pays $11/hour. I am also the music director at a local church that pays about $350 a month. I also teach voice lessons to a few students. That brings in about $45 a week.

Up until now, I've at least been sort of keeping my head above water. I was able to make monthly payments and still get by. But just this week, I found out that my payment schedule to my loan company went up. I now owe them TWICE what I used to owe them in a month, plus the payment due to the other loan company. All this, and I can still really only afford to pay the interest on the payment. As of right now, I have to pay about $920 PER MONTH. Add in the additional misc. expenses for a month (food, gas, etc) and I'm well beyond screwed. 

Working these three jobs, I basically leave the house for work in the morning and don't get home until 10 or 11 at night. The weekends are usually the same. I have no idea what to do. I know there is no way I can pay any of this off and that I'll be in debt for the rest of my life. I'm stuck in a house with my parents who resent me for still living there. They live paycheck to paycheck as well. I basically have no family to help me with my situation and I have no idea if I even have any options other than basically just working 16 hours a day, 7 days a week, for the rest of my life. I've pretty much given up all hopes and dreams of getting married, having a family some day, having my own place to live, or pretty much anything. I'm so depressed and panicked and I have no idea what to do.

Please. I need advice.

tl;dr: No.

&gt;""Beating the market"" is an obviously zero-sum proposition: every dollar of above-average returns needs to be balanced by a dollar of below-average returns; that's just what an average means. Except that in practice if you're trying to get the average return, you pretty much just buy All The Stocks — in the form of a low-cost index fund — and wait until you retire, while if you're trying to get an above-average return you're either paying some swami to manage your money or day-trading frantically or both. Swami fees, and trading commissions, subtract from your return. So everyone looking for average results gets average results; everyone looking for above-average results on average gets below-average results.

...


&gt;One simple measure of this is that, beyond the fact that the average mutual fund is bad, there's the even more disturbing fact that this year's good mutual funds are unlikely to be good next year. Which strongly implies that the above-average funds just got lucky this year...

23, 76k-80k (bonus dependent), 202k home (brand new), live in the south, 6 year girl friend at 40k soon to be over 50k. I can easily afford the house even if we were to split, also I bought the house myself, she will not be on the mortgage until we are married in about a year. Also any money she pays towards to extra principle outside of her “rent” payments would be refunded to her in the event of a break up. I have do debt outside of a car loan that has payments of $280/month. My mortgage payments are $1199 a month including about $112 in PMI (I will be out of PMI in 2 years).


**Can I afford a home?**


This is the most important first question any potential home buyer should think about. Generally a good rule is about 3x your yearly income before taxes is a good way of finding what you can afford, if you are more conservative I would advise 2x-2.5x.  Now you might think you can afford a lot more because you have been approved for loans of 4x your income or maybe your dad told you 4x. My 3x would be about 240k which I am nowhere near. The reason being is first time ownership costs a SHIT TON of money. Let me say that again, A SHIT TON. All those great perks and freebies of living in an apartment are now on you. I will now go into these costs below.


**Now I have an idea of what I can afford in terms of a mortgage, how do I know a house is for me?**


First off, if this thought has entered your mind “I am just throwing away money by renting!! I need to buy a home now!!” please smack yourself until it disappears and you forget it altogether.  Before even thinking about the additional costs of owning the home you have to think of the additional costs of acquiring the home. Use this calculator to help get an idea of what I am talking about:


http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=0


**So now I am convinced that I should buy a home, I can afford the kind of house I want and it is beneficial on the rent vs. buy calculator. What is next?**


Now you need to think about some very important questions:

-	Do I see myself wanting to live in this area for the foreseeable future?
-	Is my job stable enough to be sure I can live in this area for the foreseeable future?
-	Are there any short sighted things effecting my decision? (Girlfriend, parents, comparing yourself to others)
-	Will you be buying this home with a girlfriend? How will things work out if you break up? Can you afford it without her? What are the laws regarding these situations?
-	Do I have an emergency fund that can cover all the expenses listed below as well as the expense listed in the rent vs. buy calculator regarding closing costs?
-	Again, do you have an emergency fund? DO NOT LIE! If you lose your job 1 month after closing, you better be safe for at least 6 months of mortgage payments as well as bills.
-	Do I have a large enough down payment to avoid PMI?
-	Will I get out of PMI quickly if I want to buy now?
-	Can I take care of a home? A lawn? Leaks? Painting the house?
-       How big of a house do I want VS. how big of a house do I need? Really think about this as the bigger the home the bigger the costs on a monthly and yearly basis. Everything is multiplied: heating/cooling, repairs, roofing, electric etc. Try to buy the smallest house that will accommodate your needs. You may wonder why I bought such a large house while giving out this advice. The reason being that I see great value in the extra space, one example is one room is now my personal gym which saves me and my girlfriend at least $80/month.

I am not going to go into detail about how you should answer those questions or what is right or wrong because it should be obvious, if you don’t plan on living somewhere for more than a year why the hell would you buy a house?


**I answered all the questions. I am ready for a house. It makes sense on the rent vs. buy calculator and I see no issues with your questions. What else do I need to do?**


Now we are at the part that will make some of you run off crying and I apologize for that. I bought a brand new house so my costs will be A LOT lower than if you were to buy a 5 year or 10 year old house. Think about major repairs like: roof, appliances, plumbing etc. I don’t have to worry about that right now.


Here is a breakdown of my costs of home ownership along with estimates of their costs:


**I do not include insurance/pmi/taxes as they are in escrow for me or built in the mortgage payments, also did not include internet/tv etc**


My house specs: ~2800 sq ft / 5br **!! Also very important, I live in the south so these numbers will be extremely cheaper than if you were to live in say SoCal/NYC/Boston/DC. These are facts you should obviously know and account for. When I wrote this guide it was for friends who live near me so I did not have to add this disclaimer!!**


-	General saving in case of major repair = $2000/year
-       General upgrades and decorations = $50/month
-	Fenced my 1/3 acre lawn with a wood privacy fence = $2200/1 time
-	Fence care = $350/year
-	Water = $40/month
-	Electric = $110/month
-	Natural gas (not required)  = $24/month
-	Security (not required) = $30/month
-	Fully furnish the house = $600 ** I was given furniture from my grandparents and parents so my cost here is EXTREMELY low, to furnish my house the way I would like to would cost about $6200 from what I have gathered.**
-	Pest services (not required) = $100 /year
-	Lawn mower (not required) = $200
-	Weed whacker (not required) = $50
-	If you do not have them blinds are EXTREMELY expensive I am talking around $2000 for a house my size, I did not buy them however as they are almost always worked into the house price as well as appliances. Appliances could be another $2000 if the house doesn’t come with them.
-	Ceiling fans (not required) = $500


**This all I can think of right now but I will be sure to update this if I think of more.**



**If you have successfully read through everything above and you are 100% sure you understand everything, you are ready to buy a home in my personal (NOT PROFESSIONAL) opinion. My advice on home buying is below:**


-	Find an area you like first, as always location is the most important thing.
-	Check websites for crime in the area, looks at the schools if you plan on having kids or if you have them.
-	See how your commute would be, actually drive to the house in the morning and drive to work as if you woke up in your new home. Do the same thing when you leave work. DO NOT SKIP THIS.
-	Drive the area at night and see what it is like, make sure it is still suburbia when the lights go off.
-	See what general traffic you’ll have to deal with for years will be like.
-	See if there is an HOA and be sure to read their guidelines and understand all the rules before buying a home.
-	Find a real estate agent based on referral from people much older than you and from someone you trust. This will help greatly.
-	Figure out EVERYTHING you want. This will help in buying your home. Here is the actual list I sent my real estate agent, she called me because she couldn’t believe a 23 year old could possibly be so prepared and knowledgeable. 

**Important:**


- 3-5 bedrooms (Optimal 4+)
- 2+ baths
- 1750+ square feet (Optimal 2400+)
- Garage
- 2006+
- No need for very soon repair of: A/C, roofing, similar

**Great Pluses:**


- Gas range
- Granite counters or island
- Fenced in backyard
- 2 car garage
- Stainless steel appliances
- Prefer black cabinets/counters
- Prefer that appliances stay as well as ceiling fans
- Patio area
- No need for repainting

**Negatives:**


- Most expensive / Least expensive house on street
- Has cut out for where TV should go (hole in wall)

Key thing to remember about a realtor -- they work for you. Ask them questions, have them show you as many houses as you want, ask them for information on recently sold homes, ask them to send you newly listed houses etc. They make more money based on how much more you spend so keep that in mind as well. I ""trusted"" my realtor for finding me the locations and getting me comp information. At the end of the day though you also need to do your own research and ALWAYS be ready to walk from a house if the price isn't right. Some times the sellers just won't be reasonable.

Now that you have been very thorough your agent should find you a great place and you should be ready to go! There are definitely more things to the process and it’s a shit ton of paper work, but I won’t get into that right now as I just typed more than I have since college writing this up. I may edit later if people find this useful.

It's balance was $25,000 at the time of graduation. I also had $2,000 in credit card debt as well. 

As of Friday, I am officially debt free. Not only that, but I've learned a few things from this subreddit along the way. I have close to $5k in my rrsp, and $2k in an ING direct account for emergency purposes. 

Looking forward, I will be investing into my future. I will be attending college in September and looking forward to starting a new career in the IT field after graduation. Between now and then, I will be saving for tuition and investing more heavily in both my RSP and TFSA.

1363609277.0,162,self.personalfinance,1aiqta,"Broke my lease, got a ""bill"", asked for explanation, got silence. What do?",213,51,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1aiqta/broke_my_lease_got_a_bill_asked_for_explanation/,"Background- I moved from Indiana to New York last year, which required me breaking my lease at my apartment. I gave them my new address before I left, and they said they'd send me my final statement. I expected about $2000 (it wasn't a very clean move, I had pressing reasons, and I could handle it.).

A month went by, no mail. They had my phone number, but no calls. I called them to check on it and they said ""I'm glad you called, we were about to send your file to collections"". I explained that I was under the impression I was waiting for their bill. They said they'd send it to me asap. The following week I get a one page payment agreement to pay over $3500 in $250 monthly installments for me to sign. I didn't sign it. I called them asking them to explain my bill, and they balked. Something along the lines of ""Well, you only gave us 45 days notice instead of the 60 days in your contract, so we charged you for 2 months rent, plus these cleaning charges."" I, knowing that I needed communication in paper, asked them to send me an itemized bill explaining each charge, and they assured me they would.

Another month. No mail, no calls. At this point I was getting worried, because I was willing to pay the amount I owed them, I just wanted a record of charges to verify my obligation (The same property management company tried to charge us a $2000 breaking fee until I pointed out that they only added it to their revised lease, which we had never signed). I called them again and got told ""It's a good thing you called, your file was going to collections on monday"". Hrm. I explained to them again my situation, and they said they'd mail my bill the following week.

That was months ago. I'm nervous and irritated. I haven't been the subject of any collections activity. My credit isn't great as it is thanks to some irresponsible living in my early years, and I don't want this to impact my record. What are my options?

For more background, the property management company that we signed our lease with was very prompt and pleasant and never gave us trouble. They got replaced by a different PMC about 3 months before we gave notice, sent out a new lease to everyone without any explanation beyond ""If you could just sign this new lease, that'd be great."", which I read carefully and determined it changed nothing except added the lease breaking charge. They also suffered from some severe disorganization in the fileroom, and two of the times that I called, they had to call me back because ""I can't seem to find your file"".

It's pretty easy to understand. Enter your salary, number of roommates, and your state/county tax rates. Adjust your rent, water, and electric (or general utilities amount) bills and these will propagate into the large expense table. Feel free to add/subtract lines from here. It's obviously customized to my budget, but it's pretty close to what most people would have in theirs.

Contributions and retirement estimates are all automatic and will respond to changes in your salary/number of roommates and your 401K/savings/stocks/giving percentages. Feel free to play around with it. Any values in (red) are negative. The important positive values are in green.

Enjoy, and let me know if there is anything I should change! I'll be updating it and re-uploading it for you guys.

I then started looking at scholarships/grants or whatever that helped me pay my tuition.  Luckily, I managed to get a full-ride during at the end of my sophomore year (and good thing too because I was literally a week away from dropping out of college before I got my scholarship letter).

1362848108.0,156,self.personalfinance,19z5ro,Study Abroad - Yes or No?,203,47,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/19z5ro/study_abroad_yes_or_no/,"I've seen a few posts on here recently asking if they should study abroad, is it financially responsible, etc., so I thought I'd share my opinion as someone who is very careful about saving and being (at least trying to be) financially responsible.

First, I'll admit, with the exception of a bit of traveling I did after my study abroad and the flight to get there, the costs were the same as my normal tuition, so I didn't have a huge increase in tuition to study abroad. Anyway, here are my thoughts on the subject as a 30 year old who studied abroad in Rome when I was 20 (sort of depressing it has been 10 years).

Studying abroad is a truly once and a lifetime experience. You get to live in a country for months. This is incredibly different than taking a vacation. When you are on vacation for a week you cram everything in. When you are living there you can wander the streets, go to attractions more than once, get a feel for how the people there really live. I can't recommend it enough, even if it might be hard financially, try to make it work IMO.

When you are there, you can still save money. Most of my meals in Italy were from grocery stores.

Take full advantage of each day you are there. You don't need to fill each day with museums, but don't waste your time there. If you think of the cost and how much value you get per day, it is an incredible value. But find things to do all the time. I didn't watch TV when I was there, but knew of kids in my program who would watch DVD's in their apartment hungover on a Saturday. If you are going to do that, don't waste your time or money.

Go somewhere that allows you to travel during or after your program (yes this costs additional money, but again, this might be one of your only chances in life, so find ways to save or earn extra money and make it work). I backpacked for a few weeks after my program across Europe on very little per day -- and my only regret now is not backpacking for longer.

Some might disagree with this, but I say, go somewhere they don't speak English. Going to Australia, England, or New Zealand might be fun, but personally I don't think you are getting the same value and experience. I doubt going to any of these places will really change your world view all that much.

If you are considering this, you are young. So you likely have a commodity in my mind nearly as valuable as money -- you have time and not a ton of responsibilities (no mortgage, no wife, no kids, maybe just your student loans). Time will allow you to enjoy the experience more, but time also allows you to find cheaper ways to travel, maybe you will take that really slow bus that only costs a few dollars because you aren't in a rush to get to the next place. As I plan vacations now, I find myself paying 100x for a flight somewhere that is an hour flight vs. an 8 hour bus ride because I only have so many days now to travel.

To be clear -- I wouldn't advocate going into enormous debt for the experience, but I wouldn't say don't do it because it will cost you a lot of money or you might need to go into a little debt for it. Work an extra job before you go, work extra when you get home. It will be worth it, I promise. Unless you have to take one tens of thousands of dollars of additional debt, I'd bet you'd find it to be worth it.

One additional benefit I've also found is since I had the program on my resume under education is that it has come up in almost every job interview I have ever had. Not being grilled on the subject, but almost always as a nice ice breaker and small talk. ""I love Italy"" or ""I've always wanted to visit Rome."" The career benefit here is probably a stretch, but in general, whether it is Italy, Japan, or Argentina, people like talking about it.

tl;dr Studying abroad is one of the best experiences of my entire life, hands down. If you are considering it, I'd say do whatever you can to make it happen. When you are old you won't look back on any material thing you might have bought that will even compare to the enjoyment you will get looking back on this experience.

1369516911.0,154,self.personalfinance,1f1r9s,Personal Finance If You're Under 18,206,52,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1f1r9s/personal_finance_if_youre_under_18/,"There have been some questions here lately about the best way to maximize income or earning potential if you're 16, 17, 18 years old. Here's my general advice for anyone under 18 looking to make good choices from a personal finance perspective, gathered from my own experience and the advice of others on PF.

Here are some things you don't have to worry about at age 18 or under:

- **Living expenses.** Hopefully. 

- **Investing.** You may have heard that your money can make money. You don't want it to just sit in your savings account, being useless! The problem with investing is that it takes a fairly large amount of money and a looooong period of time to be worthwhile. That's why most folks invest primarily in retirement accounts, giving their money plenty of time to make a return. 

The problem as a teen is that, while time is on your side, cash flow is not. Minimum investment in most longterm mutual funds is in the thousands. Your money is probably from a part-time minimum wage job, an allowance, or occasional gifts from family, which means it probably isn't worth it for you to invest. 

The other problem is that you will need to spend some money to get yourself started in the world. Once you put money in a retirement account, it's hard to get it out. Liquidity, or the ability to get at your money when you need it, is important right now. What if you need the money to go to college, travel, get a car/apartment/nice suit so you can find a good job? 

- **Credit.** Once you're 18, you can apply for a credit card, but more people are screwed over than helped by credit cards, especially if they're not used to using them yet. Do your research on the best card for you, don't get won over by a fancy sales pitch, and never spend more than you have in your bank account.

A debit card is different. That's just a way to access the money you have in your bank account, so it will be decline if you don't have the money. If you have a bank account, you can have a debit card. It won't build your credit score, and it doesn't hurt to have one. 

There's still a lot to be said for paying exclusively in cash, though. When you deal in cash, you always know how much you have left.


Ok, that was what you didn't need to know about. Here are some things you can do now to maximize current and future income potential:

- **Indulge your natural curiosity.** Whether in school or out, learn. Try new things. Hone your skills. When I was in high school, I fooled around with webdesign, making my own websites for fun. This gave me a marketable skill in the future and was way more useful than anything I learned in school. 

Whatever it is you like to do, do it, especially if it's constructive (making or building something) or useful to others (taking care of kids or animals, cooking, volunteering, etc.) If it's something you truly like, you'll spend more time on it, be better at it, and enjoy yourself too!

Avoid spending too much time on things that aren't useful, such as watching TV or playing video games. Everyone needs to unwind and you can't be doing something educational or constructive all the time, but make it a treat, not a way of life. Or do what I did, and draw or build WHILE watching TV.

- **Get good grades.** If you're in eighth grade or younger, this doesn't matter so much, but try every so often so you know you CAN study and make good grades if you need to. (It was a rude awakening getting to high school and realizing I didn't even know how to study.) In high school, though, grades are key. A good high school GPA can translate into more colleges wanting you more, hopefully enough to offer you a scholarship. Graduating from college with little or no debt gives you a huge financial advantage over your peers.

- **Get good test scores.** Same deal. If you're planning on going to a U.S. college, you probably need to take the SAT or ACT. (You can choose which one. They're not too different, but you may find you do better on one or the other.) You CAN study for these tests, and test scores CAN have a huge impact on your college acceptance/scholarship rates for something so silly. So go ahead and study that a few weeks or months before the test. You don't need a fancy class. A study book with practice tests will do. If you don't like your score, you can re-take the test. 

EDIT: Doing well on the PSAT can also help you - the National Merit Scholarship looks at PSAT scores. 

- **Get a job.** Obviously, this will get you money in the short-term, but starting work in your teens also has some long-term benefits.

The job you get now will probably be part-time and minimum wage. It won't rake in the big bucks, but that's okay; you don't have to worry about making enough to live on or starting a retirement account right now. What a job now will do for you is get you used to the wild, wild world of understanding your income, professional expectations, and balancing work and life. It will also provide some work experience for your resume, and, hopefully, a glowing reference from your boss. (Hold onto your boss's contact info.) 

Caveat: If your grades drop, quit or scale back on your job. A college scholarship is a way better return on your investment of time than the money you'll make at your job. 

- **Make a budget.** Now's a great time to get used to budgeting your income so you know where your money is going. Your budget can be a handwritten list of expenses, a spreadsheet, or even a series of envelopes that you put your cash into.

Make sure the things you spend your money on are worth it. Most of your expenses, if not all, are ""wants,"" not ""needs,"" so make sure they make you really happy. Or, spend money to improve your skills or increase your earning potential (e.g. bike or car to get to a better job, computer parts to build your own computer, Spanish lessons to increase your client base, flyers to advertise your baby-sitting business). 

- **Save up.** You don't have to save a huge percentage of your income, but if you lose your income, or suddenly realize your life's dream hinges on travel or camp or owning something expensive, you'll be glad you scraped by a little for your future self.

Caveat: If you realize your life's dream hinges on owning something expensive, even if you have the money, wait at least a month before buying it. 

- **Become financially literate.** If you're here, you've probably already mastered this somewhat, so congrats! People who are good at ballparking addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fraction, and percent problems in their head are going to have an edge when it comes to managing their personal finances. And you won't get caught with your pants down when it's time to take out a student loan or get a credit card if you understand what is meant by terms like compound interest, principle, balance, term, period, APR, etc.

- **Plan on going to college.** Unless you're 100% sure you want to go into a field that only requires a high school diploma, and you have a plan, going to college will increase your income potential over NOT going to college. But it doesn't matter so much WHICH college you go to. So...

- **Keep cost in mind when choosing a college.** Choosing a college is rough because the amounts they charge are just unfathomable for people who have only earned $8 an hour until now, and the adults in your life may or may not be helpful. 

From a personal finance perspective, your best bet is pick a place you can afford without going into debt (or without going into, say, more than $10,000 worth of debt), OR to go into a specialized field where an eventual high income is pretty much guaranteed (such as law or medicine). 

If you're in the U.S., the state school for your state is usually a great bet. Or if you (and your parents) don't mind your living at home for another 2 years, go to community college for your associate's, then transfer to a 4-year school for your bachelor's.

Remember, the more places you apply, the greater chance you'll end up with a good option.

- **Don't beat yourself up for making mistakes.** That's how you learn. 

To me, one of the biggest lessons of /r/personalfinance, oddly enough, is about redemption. People who dug themselves into massive credit debt can dig themselves out again. People who never saved can start.

So whatever bad thing you did, learn your lesson, and start over the next day. Got bad grades in grades 9 and 10? Getting good grades now will show improvement and you'll have something to write about in your college essay. Mouthed off at your job and got fired? Your next job doesn't need to know that. Start with a blank resume and make sure you don't do it again.

- **Realize there are more important things than money.** All of these tips have been focused on helping you reach a high income potential while minimizing future debt. But that's not all there is to life. 

College choice is a great example of this. Some students may feel passionately about a field that doesn't have a high earning potential (such as art or music) but does require a particular school or set of schools. Some students feel strongly about the atmosphere or philosophy of certain colleges. Any amount of money may be worth it to be at your dream school for four years. Choosing a college based on money only makes sense if you don't have strong feelings about other factors.

Career choice is an even more stark example. Don't commit to spending  your 40-50 working years doing something you hate just because the income potential is high. You should at least like or be okay with what you do. As long as you spend less than you make, you'll be fine, no matter how much you make in actual dollars.

In general, stuff is worth less than you think, and experiences are worth more than you think. Blowing twenty bucks to go to the amusement park with your friends? Worth it. It's just one day, but the memories will be with you forever.

**tl;dr** Learn useful skills, stay in school, get a job, live your life. Forget about investing or credit for now.

1366939891.0,150,self.personalfinance,1d4iak,Your home is not an investment! The plague of home ownership in America.,232,82,178,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1d4iak/your_home_is_not_an_investment_the_plague_of_home/,"I would like to take a moment to post on how high housing prices and mini-mansions in America are contributing to the abscence of weath building in the American middle class.  Some of what I say may be contreversial to those who refuse to do (or reject) the research, I understand that and welcome their opinions :).

Housing prices in America adjusted for inflation have been essentially flat for 100 years!  [source](http://observationsandnotes.blogspot.com/2011/07/housing-prices-inflation-since-1900.html) and [source2](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/business/why-home-prices-change-or-dont.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0)  To quote the NYTimes article from source 2

&gt;Over the 100 years ending in 1990 — before the recent housing boom — real home prices rose only 0.2 percent a year, on average.

That means when you factor in inflation your home is essentially returning (OVER A VERY LONG TIME) the inflation rate.  There are of course exceptions like selling your home in 2006 before the bubble busted, but face it most American's don't buy waiting on a bubble and in fact most bought in the bubble!

So my home keeps up with inflation that's good right?  WRONG, in addition to keeping up with inflation it also has property taxes that go along with it, of around 1% or 2%, so when you factor those in you actually lose a small amount on the investment per year in taxes. 

In addition a home has upkeep.  A modern roof will last 20 years and cost $3000+ to put on.  That's over $100/yr just for the roof, and you can work out the plumbing/electrical/siding/decking/windows/insulation and the rest for yourself.  The rule of thumb I found says figure on 1%-4% of the houses value per year [source](http://www.mortgageloan.com/planning-for-maintenance-costs-when-buying-a-home-3522).

That means if you bought a house IN CASH you are losing between 2-7% per year after inflation on that ""investment"".

***But what about the power of leverage?***

Note: I am not talking here about rental properties.  With a rental property the amount lost in maintence and taxes is worked into the rent price and you make money on those properties.  I'm talking about people treating thier primary residence like an investment.

***So what should we do live in RENT?!***

No, obviously home ownership is much better than the alternative of renting where you can't build any equity and lose 100%.  Let me give a scenario to illustrate.

**EXTREME CASE TO ILLUSTRATE POINT**

Back in 2012 a woman won $1,000,000 in the Michigan lottery and subsequently went out and bought two houses.  It was found out later that just a few months after winning the lottery she was on food stamps because she couldn't afford the tax payments and bills on the houses she just bought [source](http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/sideshow/michigan-woman-still-collecting-food-stamps-winning-1-201751693.html)

Clearly this woman is a financial idiot, but she illustrates a point very well, which is **many people buy a house well above what they should simply because they can afford it, but the costs of that house in turn make them poor.**

Picture this:

**BETTER ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE #1**

Joe Dirt makes $75K / yr and has $20K saved up.  He decides to buy a house, and settles on a $100,000 home where he has the 20% down payment.  He gets a good mortgage at 3.5% over 30 years and pays off the house in 30 years.

In that 30 years his home has doubled in value to $200,000

Jane Doe makes $75K / yr also and has $50K saved up.  She puts 20% down on a $250,000 home.  She also pays 3.5% over 30 years and pays off the house in 30 years with the terms of the mortgage.  Her home also doubles to $500,000 in that time.


Lets run the numbers shall we:

***JOE DIRT***

$80,000 mortgage @ 3.5% over 30 years with a 1.5% property tax and no PMI

**Total of Principal + Interest + Taxes:** $174,324.87

**Expected maintenance of $3000 (3%/year):** $90,000

**Total cost:** ~$264,000

**Net Profit: NEGATIVE $64,000**

***JANE DOE***

$200,000 mortgage @ 3.5% over 30 years with a 1.5% property tax and no PMI

**Total of Principal + Interest + Taxes:** $435,812.18

**Expected maintenance of $7,500 (3%/year):** $225,000

**Total cost:** ~$660,000

**Net Profit: NEGATIVE $160,000**

***LETS NOT FORGET***

Jane Doe also has higher heating/electic and other utility costs associated with that larger house.

In addition the monthly payments are:

Joe Dirt: $484.24
Jane Doe: $1,210.59

Meaning that Joe Dirt could in theory sink an extra $725 a month into the mortgage to pay it off faster, saving him $46,000 in interest and 21 years on his loan.

***SO WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN!?***

What this means is that you should spend the least on a house you can call home!  Home is where the heart is, not necessisarily where the extra 2000 square feet are.

The average home is 600 square feet bigger than it was in the 1970's [source](http://www.census.gov/const/C25Ann/sftotalmedavgsqft.pdf) and they only keep getting bigger.  So if you are thinking of buying a home, and you think it's a great investment, ask yourself:  ""Do I really need all of that?!""

**Disclaimer:** For some people ""The American Dream"" is owning the home of their dreams.  To these people owning the home is enough for them to say ""I've made it, I don't care about the money I would have saved.""  To them I say congrats on living the dream, none of the above applies to you.

For the rest of us who think ""our home is an investment so I'm gunna buy one thats big and comfy.""  Ask yourself how much money could you really save giving up some of that quality of life?  By my estimates it's around ***7.5% a year*** on every dollar you don't spend on a house.

I'm panicking because I don't know how long it's going to take for me to get a new job, and I don't know what to do next.  I'm wondering what I can do to stay afloat until I get another paycheck while not screwing myself over for years to come.

Here are some details:

1.  I'm mid-twenties, single, living in the DC area, and have been working in software development since college (as an analyst, not a programmer.)

2.  I bought a condo back in February, and (pretty dumb) wiped out my savings and took a $25K loan to pay for it.  My personal savings are very low from buying the condo (barely $1K), and I have about $23K left on the loan.  EDIT: The cost of condo association fees, utilities, and the loan together are about $1400/month.

3.  My 401(k) has about $21K in it.

4.  I have $4K left of credit card debt at 9%.  The card has a $25K max.

5.  I have a couple of student loans totalling $7K, at rates ranging from 1.8% to 6.8%.

6.  My car is paid off and worth about $10K.

I'll be hitting the classifieds pretty heavily over the next couple of days, but what should I do if I don't get anything for a month?  Two months?  Six months?  My co-workers and I have been talking about it, and here are some of the ideas they've had.

1.  Cash out the 401(k) and use it to cover the next few loan payments.

2.  Cover everything on credit card until the next job comes, and then make paying the credit card the top priority.

3.  Sell the car.

4.  Sell the condo. (I really, really don't want to do this, because I love the location, and it would take me a couple months to get it sold - thanks, condo association rules!)

5.  Enlist in the military.

6.  All of the above.

However, the problem is about to get a lot worse.

April 2013: All Visa merchant acquirers (get credit card data, send it to Visa) must support EMV (chipped credit cards - the chip cannot be cloned like the magswipe).

October 2015: If only one party doesn't supports a chip (e.g. card is chipped but merchant doesn't check it, or the merchant can check chips but the card doesn't have one), Visa will immediately side with the party that did support chips on any dispute. This means almost every card out there and every merchant is going to upgrade. This excludes ATMs and gas pumps. Issuers &amp; stores will start replacing with compliant gear in the meantime (chipped cards, readers that can read chips).

October 2017: Gas pumps have the same rules as other points of payments regarding liability.

-----

**What do we still not have a date for?** ATMs. Australia just rolled out EMV and [they're delaying compliance for ATMs too](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/260421/massive_payment_card_upgrade_has_mixed_results_in_australia.html). This means ATMs are now the ""soft target""; where criminals can use the easily cloned magnetic strips and still drain money from bank accounts. When EMV was implemented in Britain, card-not-present fraud (e.g. online and phone) rose as card present fraud plummeted. 

So what'll happen? Crooks used to doing fraud at retail will start doing it at ATMs more. Criminals look for the weakest link - and ATMs are going to become them because upgrading them to support chips is a highly manual process. 


-------

- Try to use ATMs you are familiar with. If something looks odd, don't use the ATM.

- Feel free to tug at the card reader and PIN pad to see if they move. If anyone asks what you're doing, explain.

- Try to use ATMs within bank vestibules if possible, although they are not immune from attack, they tend to be under more surveillance. 

- Always cover the PIN pad with the hand you are not using to enter your PIN in case there is a camera mounted somewhere on the body of the ATM.

•I am a fifty-seven-year-old male, married with three children. About 70 percent of us earn 80 percent or more of our household's income. 

•About one in five of us is retired. About two-thirds of us who are working are self-employed. Interestingly, self-employed people make up less than 20 percent of the workers in America but account for two-thirds of the millionaires. Also, three out of four of us who are self-employed consider ourselves to be entrepreneurs. Most of the others are self-employed professionals, such as doctors and accountants. 

•Many of the types of businesses we are in could be classified as dullnormal. We are welding contractors, auctioneers, rice farmers, owners of mobile-home parks, pest controllers, coin and stamp dealers, and paving contractors. 

•About half of our wives do not work outside the home. The number-one occupation for those wives who do work is teacher. 

•Our household's total annual realized (taxable) income is $131,000 (median, or 50th percentile), while our average income is $247,000. Note that those of us who have incomes in the $500,000 to $999,999 category (8 percent) and the $1 million or more category (5 percent) skew the average upward. 

•We have an average household net worth of $3.7 million. Of course, some of our cohorts have accumulated much more. Nearly 6 percent have a net worth of over $10 million. Again, these people skew our average upward. The typical (median, or 50th percentile) millionaire household has a net worth of $1.6 million. 

•On average, our total annual realized income is less than 7 percent of our wealth. In other words, we live on less than 7 percent of our wealth. 

•Most of us (97 percent) are homeowners. We live in homes currently valued at an average of $320,000. About half of us have occupied the same home for more than twenty years. Thus, we have enjoyed significant increases in the value of our homes. 

•Most of us have never felt at a disadvantage because we did not receive any inheritance. About 80 percent of us are first-generation affluent. 

•We live well below our means. We wear inexpensive suits and drive American-made cars. Only a minority of us drive the current-model-year automobile. Only a minority ever lease our motor vehicles. 

•Most of our wives are planners and meticulous budgeters. In fact, only 18 percent of us disagreed with the statement ""Charity begins at home."" Most of us will tell you that our wives are a lot more conservative with money than we are. 

•We have a ""go-to-hell fund."" In other words, we have accumulated enough wealth to live without working for ten or more years. Thus, those of us with a net worth of $1.6 million could live comfortably for more than twelve years. Actually, we could live longer than that, since we save at least 15 percent of our earned income. 

•We have more than six and one-half times the level of wealth of our nonmillionaire neighbors, but, in our neighborhood, these nonmillionaires outnumber us better than three to one. Could it be that they have chosen to trade wealth for acquiring high-status material possessions? 

•As a group, we are fairly well educated. Only about one in five are not college graduates. Many of us hold advanced degrees. Eighteen percent have master's degrees, 8 percent law degrees, 6 percent medical degrees, and 6 percent Ph.D.s. 

•Only 17 percent of us or our spouses ever attended a private elementary or private high school. But 55 percent of our children are currently attending or have attended private schools. 

•As a group, we believe that education is extremely important for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren. We spend heavily for the educations of our offspring. 

•About two-thirds of us work between forty-five and fifty-five hours per week. 

•We are fastidious investors. On average, we invest nearly 20 percent of our household realized income each year. Most of us invest at least 15 percent. Seventy-nine percent of us have at least one account with a brokerage company. But we make our own investment decisions. 

•We hold nearly 20 percent of our household's wealth in transaction securities such as publicly traded stocks and mutual funds. But we rarely sell our equity investments. We hold even more in our pension plans. On average, 21 percent of our household's wealth is in our private businesses. 

•As a group, we feel that our daughters are financially handicapped in comparison to our sons. Men seem to make much more money even within the same occupational categories. That is why most of us would not hesitate to share some of our wealth with our daughters. Our sons, and men in general, have the deck of economic cards stacked in their favor. They should not need subsidies from their parents. 

•What would be the ideal occupations for our sons and daughters? There are about 3.5 millionaire households like ours. Our numbers are growing much faster than the general population. Our kids should consider providing affluent people with some valuable service. Overall, our most trusted financial advisors are our accountants. Our attorneys are also very important. So we recommend accounting and law to our children. Tax advisors and estate-planning experts will be in big demand over the next fifteen years. 

•I am a tightwad. That's one of the main reasons I completed a long questionnaire for a crispy $1 bill. Why else would I spend two or three hours being personally interviewed by these authors? They paid me $100, $200, or $250. Oh, they made me another offer--to donate in my name the money I earned for my interview to my favorite charity. But I told them, ""I am my favorite charity.""

My dad needs a job that helps my family..",217,64,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1a1nzk/i_need_serious_advice_i_am_22_recent_college_grad/,"Hi everyone. I wrote about this in my community thread (Maryland) and they recommended I post it here, to experts on this topic.  My problem deals with me being so young and trying to get a loan to pay off my parents debt.  Read the situation below if you would like, or the questions are at the bottom. I appreciate your time reading my post and any help or assistance  you can provide.  

-----

It pains me to have to write about something like this on a forum, but we live in this day &amp; age where I guess it is more acceptable. So here it goes...

My family has suffered a lot of turmoil over the years because one of my siblings had to get serious surgery as a baby to survive (and a few more surgeries continuing into his youth). Medical bills were astronomical.. actually, astronomical is an understatement. Since my mother had the better insurance, my father has had to quit his jobs many times to care for my sibling; take him to all his appointments, etc. I'm sure you all heard of ""pre-existing condition"" in insurance, well.. my mom could then never quit HER job, because no insurance companies would cover my sibling because of all of his medical problems. Talk about a dilemma. Other family crises occurred and my dad always had to be the one to help out, because my mother couldn't quit her job, she had the benefits. My dad finally had a great job in home improvement but when 9/11 happened he was laid off. He does not have a college degree, even though I personally think he is a brilliant man, kind, and reliable, so it was hard for my old man to find a job. Since 9/11 he has been a self-employed handyman, doing everything from paint jobs to other home improvement. The problem is, my father isn't the most organized and he is also very old school. He has people he needs to bill from over 4-6 months ago, and doesn't have the time to compile and send out his bills while doing current work. It is very hard for my parents to make ends meet bill-wise. Now that I and my siblings are older, my dad has more free time because I can help take my sibling to his doctor appointments. My dad would be a perfect candidate for a 9-5 job now.

As a 22 year old, I just recently graduated college (I'm a first generation college student) and was never informed of all of their problems. They hid it from me, ashamed. But now it is nipping us in the butt. They have so many bills backed up that they are behind on, I am afraid we are going to lose our house. This scares the living crap out of me.

I've tried really hard to help them as much as I could. I have been working on my own company out of my basement and I am now making more than I ever had in a real job. On top of trying to pay off my $100,000+ in college debt I am giving every single penny back to them to pay for all their bills and try to get them caught up.

I finally was able to get in touch with some debt collectors today, and it turns out they are over $50,000 in debt and may lose the house. It's only a matter of time. Because of my good credit score from running my own company (I checked it online, its a 725.. is this good?)  I am hoping to take out a loan for them to get them situated but I know this will not fix the problem. I know my dad cannot handle being a handyman anymore. He needs something where he doesn't need 1,000 tools and personally hand write all his bills. 

Literally, any job where he is paid a wage and issued a paycheck is better at this point. He just needs some uniformity in his life. I think that will alleviate their financial distress and I also plan on working with some financial advisers to get them set up on a monthly affordable budget. It also makes me want to cry to think that my parents are nearing retirement age and are about to lose their only home. They are good people that just are too in over their head. I'm sure many other people are in the same crisis right now, and I feel for you and am right there with you. But I have no idea what to do. I am calling a foreclosure lawyer tomorrow and also meeting with a bank to try and get a loan to help them, but I am just so scared about this uncertainty.

So a few things to close this up: 
1. If ANYONE out there is hiring (in Maryland - Baltimore County preferred), please let me know! My dad is SUPER AWESOME! He's shy, but he's a very humble bald-headed man who is very intelligent.

2. If any of you could help me figure out where to get a loan, I have no idea where to start. Do I have to get multiple small ones? Or one big one? Does it even work that way? 

3. Has anyone been foreclosed upon? What are some things I should do? Should I call the attorney?

-- UPDATE -- 4. After speaking with the bank, they tell me that I should try to get a remodification on the loan,  but if that doesn't work I will probably have to ""Buy the house"" from my parents to get rid of the debt.  They weren't sure if I would be able to get a loan for that amount.  

I am just asking for any assistance or advice. Thank you in advance, I really appreciate it.

**Now onto brass tacks. What did I do today? What happened?**

I thought carefully about what Reddit said. Today I forged a path using what I determined to be the most intelligent and relevant pieces of advice in the thread. I began this morning by asking my boss for a private meeting. We met later that afternoon. In this meeting I began by telling him I was

1. Unhappy with my compensation.
2. That because of my contributions to the company, X revenue was generated.
3. That because of 2\., he could expect me to bring in Y revenue in the future.
4. That a 25% raise was eminently fair based on 2\. and 3\.
5. At this point, I knew that I was *in for a dime, in for a dollar*, so I asked for a bonus equal to 50% of my annual salary.

He told me that a 25% raise would make me the highest paid employee with my title, and that it was more in line with what managers were making. This invalidated what my coworker said (I always knew that was a possibility!), but I'd crossed the path of no return. I stood my ground.

He tried to fish for reasons why I came to him all of a sudden with such a huge compensation request. I told him I'd been putting off this conversation for a long time. I told him that I wasn't there to compare myself with other employees, that I was there to focus on what I could bring to the company, and what the company could justifiably pay me in return. I told him I knew the number was a bit arbitrary but I had to ask for something concrete.

He told me he would get back to me at the end of the day. 5:30 rolls around, and he pulls me into an office. He tells me that his boss and him carefully reviewed my request. He offers me the following:

* 20% raise
* 50% of my annual salary as a bonus

I accepted, and we shook hands. Inside I was bubbling with glee but trying to keep my business face on. I thanked him and got up to leave. 

As I left, he asked me not to share my compensation.",,False,,t5_2qstm,False,,,True,t3_qu0p6,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/qu0p6/followup_i_just_found_out_a_coworker_is_making/,

* 90k in debt between 3 private lenders ($700/month min)
* 30k in debt in direct federal loans ($300/month min)
* Rent and utilities every month runs me ~$860
* I make about 24k a year waiting tables, but will likely in the next 6 months be able to find a job making in the neighborhood of 40-50k.

Anyway, I had been squeaking by, making minimum payments on my private loans ($700/mo) with the intention of aggressively paying off my loans as soon as I came into a better employment situation. Then, I got a call from Federal Loan Servicing telling me my payments are 3 months behind ($1,200) on the four federal loans that up until that time I was unaware I had. Eek.

Obviously, since I was barely making it when I was unaware of my Federal loans ($300/mo), there is no way I can make it with them. So I ask you folks, what are my options?

What is the likelihood of being able to receive some sort of forgiveness/forbearance/deferment on some of my loans? And should I seek that forgiveness/forbearance/deferment from my private lenders or from my Federal lender?

There are also other repayment options (Graduated/Extended/Income-Contingent). Would any of these be a good idea?

What about loan consolidation?

Many questions, I know. There is just a lot going on with many lenders and I'm not even sure where to begin. Thanks in advance.

1355360954.0,149,self.personalfinance,14rbbl,[ProTip] You are probably calculating cost of living vs salary differences incorrectly.  ,192,43,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/14rbbl/protip_you_are_probably_calculating_cost_of/,"**TL;DR don't compare only salary differences and cost of living differences to give you comparisons for where you'll better stretch your dollar**

I've seen this a couple of times here, and pretty often in my personal life.  People often use this logic to compare job offers in different cities, and I just want to make sure they understand how to actually measure this difference. The logical fallacy is simplified as follows:

&gt; Making $100k a year in RichTown is like making $50k a year in RuralTown since the cost of living is twice as high in RichTown

You're not accurately comparing the two cities.  I'll explain with quick case study.  Let's compare my hometown, to a city with much cheaper costs of living.  

Let's say I live in San Jose, California and I make $100,000 a year.  My monthly living expenses (rent + bills + food) comes out to about $2,000 a month, or $24,000 a year.  San Jose has a cost of living index of 168.  You will owe approximately $18,000 in Federal taxes, leaving you with $58,000 a year.  

Buffalo, NY has a cost of living index of 78.  For a ballpark comparison we can probably assume that (78/168) * $24,000 gives us $11,000 a year for cost of living.  Here is where the fallacy comes into play, if you assume that because it is 1-(78/168)% (that's not right is it?) cheaper to live in Buffalo, your salary can be (78/168) as much.  This is where you would be wrong!  (78/168) * $100k gives you a salary of $46,400 a year.  After $11k in living expenses and $5k in taxes, you are left with $30,000.  

I've purposefully narrowed out the cost of living to rent + bills + food because these are the things most likely to be effected by regional price variations.  Here is a quick list of things that are not appreciably less expensive in Buffalo than San Jose

* Electronics
* Cars 
* Airfare (Likely more expensive from places far from regional hubs)
* Public University Tuition (Buff State $5570/yr vs San Jose State $7000/yr)

Some things will be less (labor for contractors/mechanics/plumbers etc), and some things will be more (Airfare), and some things will appear less but in reality end up about the same (gas may be cheaper, but you're probably not walking to the store in Buffalo).  

In summary that leftover $58,000 is going to feel like you have a lot more of a buffer, and give you a better ability to save for retirement, than the $30,000 a year.  Even if purchases in this category of ""non-living"" expensive were more expensive across the board, its extremely unlikely that it would be twice as expensive.  If we assumed an even cost of items in this category, you would need to earn $80,000 a year in Buffalo to feel like you were earning $100k a year in San Jose.  

**Conclusion**

Of course this is greatly effected by your spending habits; what you do with that leftover money will effect how much more expensive/cheaper a certain area would be to you.  If you guys could help me refine this a bit, we could come up with a spreadsheet that would help people compare job locations.  I'm sure I've made logical or mathematical errors somewhere here, so feel free to point these out and correct so people can get the best advice.

The story starts about 6 months ago when my motorcycle broke down. I needed about $200 for parts, and my wife told me we didn't really have the budget for it right then, and told me to just keep it garaged and she'll buy the stuff when it comes up. Didn't really think anything of it at the time. Last month I was on the phone with my wife, and said I was going to get some gas to fill up the tank, and she told me to hold on while she put some money on my card. This rose a bit of a red flag with me.

I've been married for nearly 4 years now, and since before we even got married my wife has been doing all of our finances. She's the one that budgets for everything, pays all the bills, everything. I'm just the guy that brings home the paycheck. Before December I hadn't even logged into my bank account in probably close to a year, my wife just handled everything.

So, in December I sat down with my wife and went over all of our finances. Here's where we're at:

* CC- $6500 at 16.99%  
* CC- $4400 at 11.00%  
* CC- $3500 at 20.99%  
* CC- $3400 at 16.24%  
* CC- $2700 at 15.99%  
* CC- $2700 at 9.90%  
* Several store specific cards (Target, Victoria Secret, Gap, etc..) not even sure... Monthly minimums are around $700.  
* Car loan - $450 per month  
* Mortgage - $1500 per month  
* Student loans - $40k or so, deferred until my wife stops taking classes  
* $5 in our savings account

Basically every credit card my wife has is maxed, and our joint card is really close to maxed. Seeing all those big debt numbers was really shocking to me because I make really good money, and I consider myself very frugal. I take my lunch to work everyday, I haven't bought any work clothes except for a couple button down shirts in the past 3 years and a new pair of dress shoes, I never eat out, I had been driving the same car for the past 11 years until we traded it in in June for a new SUV for my wife and now I drive her old car that's new to me.

For January I decided we would track all of our spending. I really couldn't see where our money was going other than to minimum payments to all the credit cards.

* I spent $30- ate out twice, bought a couple sodas from vending machines and bought a new bicycle pump  
* Wife spent $430- new shoes, haircut, eating out and other minor stuff  
* $100 on entertainment- went out on a date and saw a movie  
* $230 on gas  
* $480 on food (not counting the individual eating out or the date together)  
* $160 on stuff for the house  
* $44 on misc stuff from Walmart and Target  
* $400 on Utilities  
* $1500 on the Mortgage  
* $700 towards the miscellaneous cards
* $200 on Insurance  
* $200 towards the wife's business

That total comes out to about $5k, which is about 75% of my take-home paycheck. The other 25% ($1600 ish) went to paying towards the big credit cards. No savings other than what's going towards my 401k at work. My wife didn't earn much last month, so I'm not entirely sure where that money went since she has her own business accounts and stuff.

Using a spreadsheet I found that if I keep putting $1600 towards the big credit card debt I can reduce it from $23k down to about $8k by making minimum payments on everything except the highest interest cards and working my way down. Is that what I should be focusing on?

The biggest problem I have here is that my wife knows that we were supposed to be saving last month, I specifically told her that we need to focus on paying down this debt because the interest on the creditcards alone is killing us. Despite that she still spent over $600 on stuff for herself and her business just from our joint account, no idea what's going on in her business account. She brings in less than a few thousand each month, but she justifies all of her spending as necessary in order to keep her clients and her business. She needs fancy clothes, new shoes, and expensive haircuts etc.

Any advice? What should I do in this situation?

BTW: The motorcycle is still in the garage, and still needs the $200 worth of stuff. I think I could cut our gas bill nearly in half if I took my motorcycle to work instead of the SUV. Would that be a good ""investment""? The motorcycle itself is worth maybe a thousand bucks, it's nearly 20 years old, but is still very reliable.

I started the year with nearly $35,000 in debt. $10,000 of the debt was/is my student loan and rest of it due to me paying for my sister's wedding. $14,000 for airfare for 7 passenger from USA to Bangladesh during Christmas season and $11,000 for the actual wedding. If you're shocked and looking for explanation, feel free to browse the other update threads in my history. 

Situation now: I had a pregnant wife and out son was to be born on  mid-July. Boy decided to come a month early. Total medical cost was/is $3,600 due to c-section. If it was an normal birth, the cost would've been half of that. I make $2000 every two-weeks. That's my take-home pay. I went on debt elimination frenzy and knocked my pre-medical debt to $9500. I paid of $25000 in seven months thanks to a decent tax refund check and thanks to my parents for letting me stay at their duplex rent free. I have no recurring monthly bills because daddy pays for everything. He's paying for everything so I can be debt free soon and I've already paid for one of my sister's wedding and I'm going to pay for the next one also. 

I only have $9500 of student loan debt and $3600 of medical debt. I'm paying minimum to medical debt because it's interest free. I owe Sallie Mae $5000 at 9.25% interest.

Well recently my SO and I have gotten a bit more serious and I arose the idea of doing a mild form of a pre-nup. Let me preface this by saying neither of us are wealthy (we come from mid-upper class families), neither of us have debt, and we both make between 35-45k (both 23 years old).

The reason I bring up a Pre-Nup is that I've had family friends that have had messy divorces where the other person had a TON of hidden credit card debt, and then they were both responsible for the debt at the divorce. So basically someone in the marriage could live a secret life, or have a shopping addiction, and run up a ton of debt...then at the divorce both parties have to split it?

I'm playing a realist here that both of us will change over a few decades and who knows where we'll end up. So I bring up a Pre-Nup to protect each others Retirement Funds, and protect one another against (secret) debt that isn't shared in a joint account. Is this a good idea?

The lady on the phone asked me to hold on for a minute and when she got back on the line, told me that because I was unemployed when I signed up for it, the policy was invalid and that they would be refunding me the entire amount.

A week later I see an almost $300 credit on my account. Needless to say I am super impressed by Capital One's honesty and by my own stupidity.

* I have renter's insurance that covers theft, fire, etc. above $1000 worth of damage

**Do I really need to keep $13K in cash liquid at this point?** 

It seems like my insurance would cover any catastrophe.  If I kept maybe $5K in cash and put the rest in a bond fund to at least have it try and keep up with inflation, would that make sense?

Add or subtract rows only between 3 to 18 to add your own expenses. I keep my monthly bills I pay every month at the top and fill out the balances all the way across. The template I have is basically what my gf spends money on and I try to categorize miscellaneous purchases under household. 


I use this sheet in combination of an app called Balance for iOS as I don't keep paper receipts. I add my purchases immediately and when I get home I input them in my spreadsheet, mostly for ""dining out"" or ""groceries"". On my spreadsheet I have these columns filled out for $100 every paycheck which is my ""budget"" that way I can visually see my balance won't be affected too much if I go a little over. Every paycheck I enter all of my bills so my balance matches exactly what my spreadsheet will show and ""clear"" so they aren't visible. I only ""clear"" purchases after I've added them to my spreadsheet. Here is a screenshot: http://www.screencast.com/t/gbbyAj9JFKb


After every paycheck I hide the previous column that way I am only looking at what's current. I tried using other services such as Mint.com but I found that doing it manually this way was more instant and it allows me to see what I can have in my checking account a year from now based on any purchases I make in between. In my personal spreadsheet I already have plane tickets and some other travel expenses filled in leaving a nice balance. It helps me control a lot of my spending and I hope this could help someone who might prefer budgeting/saving this way. Once I get to a certain amount in my checking, I move everything into savings which sort of ""resets' my balance and I only know what I have in there when I log into my account. 


I only have one credit card so I manually just add up what I spend on the bottom and will add the same total onto the row around when my statement is sent out. Everything else is pretty automated.

I mean this will a sense of genuine curiosity. Every few weeks, we will get one of these posts: A very young person, working in very vague sounding “financial industry” making 6 figures plus.  What do they actually *do* for a job? What job in the “financial industry” pays someone so young so much money?  What kind of degree do they have? What did they learn in school?     

I don’t ask this out of jealousy or spite...I really don’t know the answer to this and I’m glad they are making so much at such a young age!  If they are smart, they can be set for life relatively young and that’s a wonderful thing.  I come from a family of teachers with absolutely *no* business savy, and I'm a computer animator so this entire ""financial industry as job"" world is a complete mystery to be.  

Most jobs, starting out I would think would have a much lower salary.  What is a 24 year old doing to earn this kind of salary? (I know the short answer is “earn money for their clients”, but I’m looking for more detail.)   Does the company basically “own” them with a  salary like that?  Do they work 100 hour weeks?  Is this type of job *extremely* difficult to get? Do you have to be brilliant or otherwise demonstrate superior skill set for the job, or is it mostly connections from school?  

BTW: They may be worth every penny, I do not know.  It just seems most lines of work take *years* to get to that salary (if ever) and I am wondering these very young folks *actually do* as a job to get these high salaries in that particular industry.  Doctor's salaries I can understand a bit more because I am more familiar with their schooling structure and what they do day in and day out, but doctors also take something like 10 years to earn a salary...they don't start doing it at 24, so I am just a bit confused as to how the ""financial industry"" works, and what it really means when people say they work there.

I pay off credit cards each month. I am married and my wife is a graduate student (some, but not a lot of income) who is starting work in May/won't be paid until June, and even then the job is only a small step up from her graduate student pay. We rent, as we are trying to be flexible about careers and trying to sell a house right now is a nightmare we don't want to deal with.

That being said, my pay is set to be reduced by more than 20% (withholdings for healthcare do not decrease proportionally despite the 20% reduction in hours) for quite some time, at least 22 weeks. (Bear in mind federal pay has been frozen for more than two years - no COLA, nothing. We were scheduled for an 0.5% raise which Congress is voting to throw out.)

Is it worth pursuing a part-time job? I am a civil engineer with a master's degree and I highly doubt anyone will hire me part time if they think I'll bolt after the furlough is over (which I will.)

* Take wage/business income, and invest as much as possible in passive income generating assets.
* Take passive income from those assets, and use it to cover as much cost of living as possible.

The goal is to get to a point of financial independence, defined as being in a position where you can live entirely off passive income (i.e. you don't need to work for a living).  The goal also encourages frugality because you have the incentive to push down your cost-of-living so that a larger proportion of it can be covered by your passive income.

I wonder how practical this is today?  It seems to me the obvious caveat is tax on the passive income, when you could be putting your money in tax-deferred investments.  My friend didn't have this problem because he got his business income in low tax zones abroad and isn't a US citizen (no tax on worldwide income) -- so effectively he was only taxed on his passive income in Canada.

I made this while I was weighing the option of going back to get a graduate degree in my field. I wanted to see if my future earning potential would justify the cost of going back to school. 

[**Salary Calculator**](http://www.manventist.com/tools/minimum_salary_calculator)


*A few notes* 

1. [This is based off of the student loan counseling everyone goes through](http://i.imgur.com/jg7DhUs.png). Recommendations from the government is that the student loan debt should be between 8-15% of one's income. I've seen other places recommend 8-12%, which determines the minimum and ideal amounts in my calculator respectively.

1. The interest rate is the same one used for the government student loan calculators you can find online, 6.8% which is the same as a the unsubsidized stafford loan. Ideally you're student loans are lower, but some may be higher private loans while others are much lower. I did this out of simplicity, but if there's enough demand I may change things so that you may add your individual loans and interest rates to calculate out the results.

1. I've also included the graduated repayment plans that can be offered, as well as ""minimum raises"" to keep up with the gradual yearly increases in these plans. 

1. Income-based repayments are not included in this since it's highly variable.
 
*Note that this shouldn't be taken as the the final say, but just to give a general idea.*

Part of my motivation is also to help some of my younger friends to understand the costs associated with their education. I remember not paying any attention to my entrance and exit loan counseling in school, until my first student loan payment came due.

If I could make every one of our customers sign something in capital letters that says ""IF I'M GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE MEETING A LOAN PAYMENT THEN I WILL CALL MY FINANCE COMPANY"" then I would do it. If your car is genuinely not affordable for you then I will politely ask you to face the music, but if you've temporarily had your hours cut or had some kind of medical emergency, then for god's sake don't wait until you're 58 days past due to call in and ask if we can help you. At that point you've been dodging calls for weeks and if we've put you out for repo then the only thing that will stop us picking up your car is a certified payment of *every cent* that's past due.

*The moment* you think you might not make a scheduled payment inside of your grace period, be proactive and call us. I know it can be a little embarrassing for some people to admit they can't meet one of their obligations, but it beats walking to work. Oftentimes if we catch something early enough we can even take action to prevent damage to your credit report. This might seem obvious to some of you but you would be surprised how many people I can hear shrug over the phone when I ask, ""Why didn't you call us six weeks ago when you knew you were in trouble?""

If you are dodging calls from us when you're past due and not making any effort to work with us to come up with a plan to get back on track, it is going to make a decision to repossess a vehicle that much easier for us. Generally speaking, everybody loses when a car gets repo'd.

I never used the card. It sat unactivated among all my financial papers for a year. I forgot it existed

Fast forward to summer 2012. I'm about to get my first grown-up job and I want to save up to buy a car and begin building my credit. I checked my credit score and it said 714, so I figured I'd get a decent rewards credit card.

WRONG. When I applied for a credit card, I was denied. So I applied for a Target card, thinking that would be easier to qualify for--also denied. Couldn't figure out why

My student loans were coming out of deferment about that time too, and as the loan counselor was going through my debts she told me about the AmEx card. Apparently, my mother has $10,000 in credit card debt on that one card.

This is why I couldn't get approved for any credit cards. So I called AmEx and got them to cancel my connection to the account and take it off my credit score. They told me my mom had to call and make another cancellation on her end (??). So my mom calls and they tell her she doesn't have to do anything because the card was already closed out (??). So I thought everything was settled. I got a secured credit card and I saved money and did all the good PF/frugal things.

Few months later, I take out a car loan (don't crucify me it was an emergency) and I get a shitty interest rate. The finance guy at the car dealership gives me a copy of my credit report and my score was in the 600s and the AmEx thing was still on there and had GROWN to nearly $12,000.

What the hell? What should I do? How do I remove this $12,000 dead weight that isn't even mine? (Sorry for the length)

**CLARIFICATION: The account is not closed, I ""closed"" my connection with the account. I cancelled the card that was in my name, but my mother still uses the AmEx account.

Finally, he said (again without me even mentioning it) that if I wanted to sell it he would just transfer the initial buy amount from his cash account back to me. I was totally expecting him to just blame me, but it seems he truly was sorry for loosing my money, and was willing to make it up to me. I almost feel a bit bad about excepting his offer, but I feel it is the best thing to do considering it was his idea, not mine. So now we both learn a great lesson, I get my money back, and our relationship is not affected. Truly fantastic, I never expected it to turn out this well. Thanks for your help!

At first, I chose to pay with my refund, got to the next page where there was one of those typical click-and-go service agreements that I've been conditioned not to read. 

However, I chose to actually read this one. If I understand correctly it states **that if you're paying your fee with your refund, Turbotax sets up a temporary bank account with one of their banks, referred to as ""BANK"" in the service agreement, which then takes out the turbotax fee, and then transmits it to you. Turbotax charges an additional $29.99 to open this temporary account and this fee is not listed in the initial charges you agree to on the previous page.** It wasn't until I pressed back at the bottom of the screen did it show me that they were charging my refund an additional $29.99, where I chose to then pay by credit card to avoid this. The service agreement states that one can avoid this fee by paying by credit card, but this fee is not mentioned at all on the previous page where you select how you'd like to pay your Turbotax refund.

[Here's the link](http://turbotax.intuit.com/support/iq/Tax-Refund/Using-Refund-Processing-Services-to-Pay-TurboTax-Fees/GEN12098.html) that details their Refund Processing Services which is where the $29.99 fee originates from.

I don't see a FAQ over at /r/insurance and I'm not ready to self-insure like [MMM](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/06/02/insurance-a-tax-on-people-who-are-bad-at-math/), at least not for certain liability coverage.  Since I can't find many recent thread on r/PF (possibly because I'm awful at searching reddit) I thought I'd just start a new one.

Here's what I currently have, which was selected 9 years ago when I started this job and I haven't ever really re-visited it, so feel free to make fun of it, critique it, or whatever:

* **Auto: $967/year**.  2 cars, &lt;10k miles per year combined, liability+collision+comprehensive with rental reimbursement to $30/day, towing to $75, no-deductible for glass.  $100k/$300k bodily injury, $25k property damage, Basic (50k) personal injury protection, $100k/$300k uninsured motorists bodily injury.  $1000 deductibles for both collision and comprehensive.  My cars are a '98 Pathfinder and '99 Corolla.  Clean driving record, but no defensive driving discount.
* **Homeowner's: $634/year**.  $308k replacement, $100k personal liability, $1k deductible.  Had hail damage on a previous home, but that is my only claim and supposedly doesn't affect the premium since it was an act of God.
* **PEL: $218/year**.  $3M coverage.  I don't know why I got this or whether it's a good thing, and it is this policy that prompted me to ask the question.

My wife and I are in our 30s, and have 3 young kids.  If there is other relevant data, tell me and I'll try to add it.

I also have life insurance and disability insurance through work.  There are tons of past threads about those, though, so I'd prefer to keep this focused on home and auto (and umbrella) policies.  

If you have specific advice for me, great.  If you have more general advice that could go into the FAQ, even better.  If you have recommendations about specific companies or agents, feel free to share, but I don't expect to find consensus on that.

EDIT 2013-06-07: Thanks everyone for the input (which is still trickling in a week and a half later!) and explanations of different insurance terms.  I ended up dropping Comprehensive and Collision and reducing the Umbrella policy to $1M, though I was tempted to keep it at $3M.  Several people mentioned the low liability coverages on auto and home, but all I need there are the minimums required by the umbrella policy, which is higher than any of you recommended.

Since my parents ""saved"" money on this they decided to graciously give me the money to start a ROTH IRA. Ever since then I've been contributing the maximum each year. It started out in a Merrill Edge account and I never actually invested any of it. At all. $20,000 made $11 in interest in 4 years. (I'm terrible at this, I know). My dad told me to set up a new ROTH IRA with Vanguard and transfer all of the money from Merrill Edge to the new account. I'm still in the process of doing the transferring, but I have the account set up with the option to choose investments when I want to.

So now I will have approximately $25K in Vanguard (once it all clears and goes through) and I know I need to invest it. Problem is I have no idea how to even begin choosing which stocks and bonds I want. There's a generic option where they do all the work for you, you just choose your projected retirement age and they adjust everything for you each year. I'm strongly leaning toward that but family and friends are telling me to choose my own investments.

If you go look up a list of top median salaries by profession, they typically range in the 80-120K for STEM workers and managers, 120-160K for senior executives, and about that or more for well paid lawyers, doctors, etc. 

Statistics like those, however, don't account for non-wage compensation like ownership profit shares, stock options, etc. which are a big part of compensation in more lucrative careers, nor for self-made income through investment or other methods.

Maybe there are books or better stats out there that I've missed, but here's my attempt to characterize pros and cons of different high income methods:

**Climbing the Corporate Ladder:** This probably the most straightforward, but because of that, there's plenty of competition which can get notoriously dirty and success with this method can depend more on politics and connections than simply being good at your job. It also has a relatively high cost of entry, likely requiring an MBA and/or other advanced degrees, but compensation can range from $200K-1MM+

**Going Out on Your Own:** Consultancies, partnerships, small businesses, etc. This seems to be a sweet spot for business savvy people in an industry that can support small-to-medium businesses. Most people successful in this arena have a background with a more established company where they developed contacts, familiarity with the industry they work in, and a work history to attract clients. Has a comparatively low cost of entry in terms of resume-style qualifications, but possibly higher in terms of actual skills, and compensation seems to concentrate in the $300-800K range.

**Being Able to Do What No One Else Can:** Athletes, rock stars, entrepreneurs, etc. Sort of an extreme version of the above, this doesn't seem to be something you can pursue predictably and so the cost of entry is arguably indeterminably high, but simply having skills that no one can match in a lucrative field leads to seemingly unbounded income. The big problems are possibly very short career either due to fast moving competition or difficult to predict setbacks, and difficulty finding work afterward, but can often lead into ""Going Out on Your Own"" in a related small business afterward.

**Income Investing:** Managed real estate, franchises or other investment methods. High capital cost of entry, typically $200K-300K+, but seems pretty reliable compared to other methods.

Obviously people mix and match, especially mixing income investing with above methods and ""Being Able to Do What No One Else Can"" is often the result of having a patent or distribution rights for some in demand product developed through a consultancy/partnership, but pursuing these four, overcoming their hurdles and pitfalls seem to be the way most people who make it above and beyond typical incomes manage to do it.

I take my personal investable assets (retirement accounts + emergency fund + investments + other cash savings) and divide it by the amount of income I would want if I were to stop working today.  This gives me a rough estimate of the # of years I could go without needing to work.  I plan to adjust my spending # with inflation.  I don't have any debt otherwise I would obviously subtract that from the assets.  I also don't currently have a mortgage but I may have to figure out how to include that in the future.

I'm 22 with a decent engineering salary and a bit confused on what to do.

**Background**: My employer matches up to 4% for my 401k. From reading this subreddit and online for a bit, I started a Roth 401k. I currently set my contributions at 4% so I can get the full match. I've also been saving a lot of my money before working for my current employer and have about $14,000 in a regular students savings account.

**Confusion**:The more I keep reading this subreddit and sources online the more confused I get so if anybody could answer these questions I have that would be great!!

1. What should I ""invest"" in for my 401k? My employer uses Fidelity and it has a decent selection. Right now I have split my contributions evenly between a Growth Fund and a Lifestyle 2050. This is what's confusing me the most, I'm worried because I just don't have any idea what I've invested into is good or not.

2. Exactly how do I get started on a Roth IRA? And how important is it to have compared just having a 401k?

3. What should I be doing with my $14,000 in savings? I know I should keep at least 6-month emergency fund in case something happens, but I feel like $14k is way to much to just be sitting in a savings account gather very little interest.

It's what I did this month with Huntington Bank, and moved all my money to Ally, where their anonymous website is more friendly and accommodating than the four real humans who failed to help me at Huntington. All over one $1.5k CD.

Here's the story:

Huntington sent me a letter in the mail telling me one of my CDs was up for renewal. After trying to close the CD online, only to be told I had to call to do that, I called their 1-800 number and waited 30 minutes to talk to someone. There, after verifying all my information and making me wait a further 5 minutes, they informed me that this couldn't be done on the phone either. I'd have to go to a branch.

Despite their claims of shattering ""bankers hours"" my branch closes at 5. So I leave work, get to the branch at 4:10. Two tellers with nothing to do, and a branch manager in his office with a client. Walk up to the tellers, say I want to close a CD. Nope, have to wait for the manager. 

So I have a seat. Time goes by - I get to listen to the tellers planning how they're going to close and go home. 4:30 - a customer comes in to deposit a check. Still waiting. 4:45 - tellers are starting to eye me angrily, as they can tell I'm going to hold them late. 5:00 and the manager is still in with a potential checking account client. 

5:20 and he leaves his office and comes over to me. The tellers are pissed, staring me down as I tell him why I'm here. AND THEN HE HAS THE NERVE TO SAY ""come back later tomorrow and we'll make an appointment.""

No. No, sir, I won't come back tomorrow. Or ever. 

So I closed all 6 CDs and withdrew my savings as well. Huntington, you've just lost a customer that you've had since I was in third grade, or about 1997.

All of that money (over $20,000) has gone to Ally now, where I'm going to earn more on my savings account than on Huntington's 5-year CD special. ",,False,,t5_2qstm,False,,,True,t3_11qpwa,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/11qpwa/can_a_website_give_better_banking_customer/,

I've never missed a payment and I've been putting a lot of extra money into the loans (every bonus last year plus more).  My loans were services by Direct loans until earlier this year when Mohela bought them out. 

The problem:
Yesterday I looked at my bank statement and found that Mohela, the company servicing my student loans, changed me an extra 132.22 dollars this month.  **I went onto their website and found my loan balance increased by over $9000.**

The two loans in question are the following:

1) $2625 distributed on 9/30/04

2) $3500 distributed on 8/31/05

These are subsidized loans and I graduated from this college in December of 2008 (government paid the interest until then).  I also deferred them for a year for grad school.

In April of 2013, the loans had the following balances:

1) $1944.20

2) $2591.14

Now on the July statement, the loan balances are:

1) **$6025.77**

2) **$8031.86**

The interest rates on these two loans were variable interest rates, but the average was about 2.3%

I called the company and they are taking their time figuring this out while I'm left here stressing over it.  They've mentioned keywords like capitalized interest.

I don't fully understand how capitalized interest works.  In my mind, there is an interest rate and that is the amount of money the bank makes off of your loan each year.  I received no notification of outstanding interest balances.  Heck they didn't even send me a notice when they increased my loan balance by over 9000... 

My old direct loans statement show $1784.47 in the capitalized interest field, but that was added into the principal balance. That number is the total for about 9 different student loans, not just these two.

Assuming an average of 2.3% interest for 8.5 years, that's a total interest of 1197.44 dollars over that period of time.  That isn't taking into account any payments being made so it should really be lower than this. (2625+3500) * 0.023 interest per year * 8.5 years = ~1200

**Can someone help explain this to me?  Am I missing something? Is there any kind of sure shot argument I can make to Mohela to get them to drop these charges?  *How is it even possible that these two loans are now 230% higher than their original balances?***




**Edit:** As much as I'd love to blame Mohela, I'm starting to think the root of the problem isn't with them.  If NSLDS.ed.gov shows the same numbers Mohela has in their systems, and Mohela pulls their data from the same source as NSLDS, it doesn't sound logical for Mohela to be the culprit. That is, unless Mohela can publish data to NSLDS.

**Edit2:** Someone here said Mohela can most likely publish data there...  So much for that theory :(

**Edit3:**  Mohela got back to me and they think it's an error.  They just don't have proof for their theory yet.

**Edit4:** Mohela believes the found and fixed the error, but it won't post on their systems for a few days and won't post on the website for about a week.  They don't know if the number will change or disappear...  Apparently some software program thought 1 months worth in interest while my loans were deferred in grad school was over 9000 dollars..

I am single, with three children (16, 15, 13) and I am 34 years old. Been divorced 3 years. Have 2.5 years of college under my belt, do NOT get child support... I make about 23K a year, and I do not have ANY debt.

The only thing I get from the state is free medical for the children. I tried to get my own, but it was incredibly expensive to get three kids covered. I pay my own medical bills. I could be covered by the state as well if I chose to go find my divorce cert (its in a box in my room) but I feel that I should pay for myself, at the very least.

Someone is going to ask so... I don't get child support because when I got divorced he had no job, so I just let it go for a bit while he got situated trying to be nice. He finally got a job, but because he is already paying child support to my sister (yes, you read that right) he basically says he is broke, lives with friends, and because I can not find his address and he lives in another state I can not serve him. He did send some money for the kids for Christmas for the first time this year... 

I manage to go to school by taking a full course load (usually 3 classes, twice a week plus my full time job) and getting the Pell Grant. That pays for all my expenses, and gives me a little extra to buy books, gas, etc. etc. I am about a year to 1.5 years from getting my transfer degree. 

I keep my expenses down by owning my car. I bought it a little over a year ago when my old car finally gave out, and paid cash for it with money I had saved up.

Every year when taxes come around I take 80% of my tax return and put it down on my rent for the year. This allows me to pay less each month, and not have to worry that rent wont be made. When I moved in they actually made me pay 7 months up front or I would not have been given the apartment. I actually do not make enough in Seattle area for anyone to want to rent me a 2 bedroom apartment. This was the only one that would do 7 months, everyone else wanted a year, and with deposits, and pet fees I could only afford 8 months.

Almost every stick of furniture in my house was bought at Goodwill or a gift from friends. Bellevue has the most amazing Goodwill where you can find some very nice furniture, and I have a good eye, so I am quite comfortable with my furniture. I spent about 2k on all of it (including three brand new beds) when I first moved into my apartment, and have only bought a few minor things since.

I got internet when I moved in, but I refuse to pay for cable, until about three months ago when they offered me the very basic cable channels for just $2 a month for life. I couldn't beat that. I also have netflix, and that is my TV viewing, plus whatever I find online. 

We go to free places when we go out usually. The park, a road trip, Pike Place, etc. etc. Though I do splurge a little and take the kids to a nice restaurant or attraction every three months when I get a bonus at work, if I get it. 

Oh, I also have a 401k which I pay into twice a month, and a savings account. ""Pay yourself first"", so like I said... I'm not broke. I actually do alright, and when my car breaks I'm not worried.

The only thing I do, sometimes, worry about is that my rent is going up faster then my pay at work. Hopefully it won't be that bad this year. I do keep saying I need a new job, lol.

So, I have been trying to piece together my financial situation and was asked to post an updated list of my income/expenses. 
 For bills that are due biannually or quarterly, I totaled them and divided by 12 so I can budget for them monthly. Listed are the absolutes that must be paid.

Here it is:



**Monthly Net Income	$6,300**
	
	
**Monthly Expenses**

Mortgage:	$1,144

Credit Cards (minimum):  $1,899

Property Taxes:	$692

Car Tax:	$30

Car Insurance:	$135

Gasoline:	$450  (I have an hour commute each way 4 x week and my husband has a 30 minute 5 x week)

Life Insurance:	$67

Home Owners Insurance:	$98

U-verse (home phone &amp; Internet):	$102

AT&amp;T Mobile (2 phones):  $130

Electric:	$150

Netflix:  $8

School Tuition:	$900

Oil:	$150 (averaged- this month the bill was $650! but in the summer it can be $0)

Water:	$150

Sewer:	$77

Food/ household:	$800

Monthly Prescriptions:	$30

Town Water Project:	$45
	
	
	
**Total Monthly Expenses:	$7,057**


I have been researching 24/7 on how best to approach this, but I've been getting no where on my own with the credit card companies since we have NEVER been late on a payment.

Even without the school tuition expense- that would leave us with less than $150/month extra.  I have not included car registration/ professional yearly license renewal/ emergency repairs...

I have an appointment next week to speak to an attorney for advice- he deals with debt negotiation...among *other* things.

Thank you all for your advice.

Sell now for a lose or wait? ,167,44,160,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/17oxyy/father_lost_about_half_of_my_savings_sell_now_for/,"Hello. I used to always let my father, who has been a ""day trader"" since he retired, manage my investments. That was until early last year when I took a class in personal finance and read some books and realized that his investing stratigy was incredibly risky and undiversified and his few years of success had probably just been luck. He invested in only one or two stocks at a time, as well as options and things like the VIX. obviously, he was opposed to me just investing in some broad market funds at vanguard, so we agreed go half and half. My half went to vanguard with both a basket of etfs and a good bit into the target retirement fund 2060 (not necessarily using it for retirement, just liked its current allocation and  lower minimum). With his half, he went 95% into the TVIX, which is violitility times two. It went up about 5 percent, and he asked me if I wanted to sell. I said its up to him since he's managing that half. He kept it, thinking it would like double when the whole fiscal cliff thing happened. Of course it didn't, and it proceeded to go from 20 a share to around 5. That's about half my life savings gone in a month. To add to that, my father has now gotten a job so can't manage that money anymore. So every day, I watch is go lower and lower, often dropping 5%+ a day. Meanwhile, I've gained a nice 15% or so at vanguard. My question is should I just tell him go sell it and accept the lose of 75% or just let it sit and hope it will at least go up to my purchase price in a few years when some other crisis is upon us. Please don't make this a thread of insulting my or my fathers discussions, we've certainly already learned out lesson. Thanks.




Edit: Thanks for all the help! Entirely convinced I should sell it asap. I'll ask my dad tonight if he would consider giving me some of the money that he lost me back, since he didn't even understand what he was investing in, and how terrible it is for anything over a day. Hope hes able to empathize with my situation. Never thought I would get this many comments, but I'll try to answer all the top ones.

Between my husband and I (both 27), we have over $400,000 in student loan debt which is accruing about $2000 a month in interest (most of it is at 7%).  The majority of the loans are my husbands and with income based repayment we pay about $400 a month, which basically means the loan will continue to grow.  

A few numbers:
$13K in emergency fund

$60K in my 401K (I am currently maxing out.. company matches up to 3%)

No Roth IRA as we file married filing separate so that only his income qualifies for income based repayment
We currently make about $7000 per month after tax.  In about 3 years, this amount will triple.  However, there is a good chance I will stop working once we have our first child, so we will only have this extra income for a year or two.

Our monthly rent is $1900 (which is low for our area)

We would like to have children in about 4 years.  We would also like to own our own place in 6-7 years.  Homes in our preferred neighborhoods start at about $400K. 

What should we do?  Do we aggressively pay down the student loans so they don't continue to grow, thus neglecting our retirement and future downpayment on a home?  Do we continue to do income based repayment? (after 25 years the loans are forgiven)  A mixture of both?  Thanks!

{EDIT}  Thank you for all of your advice!  To answer some of your questions:  My husband is currently in his residency, so the majority of the loans paid for his medical school. In two years he will be done with his residency, which is why our income will be so much higher at this point.  The $400 IBR won't be for 25 years.  Once he starts to make more money, our payments will increase.

*** *Edit 2: Two errors have been pointed out. One: The stocks qualify after two years from the beginning of the offering period. Two: I used the formula for compounding interest, when the return is inherently non-compounding. It doesn't change a whole lot: The returns are still huge.*

**** *Note: It makes sense to calculate annual return on an investment that can only be made for 1.5 months. This is so that you can compare it with other investments that can be made for the remaining part of the year. Think of it this way: a 66% annual return over a month and a half beats inflation by 63%. If I were to call it a 10% return, it would be extremely misleading. It would be assumed that it beat inflation by 7%. If you are not convinced, consider this: Is a 10% return over 1.5 months the same as a return of 10% over a year? Over 2 years? Over 100? No.*

**TL;DR at bottom**

An Employee Stock Purchasing Plan (**ESPP**) works as follows:

1. You designate payroll deductions to be held for stock purchasing. There is a **deduction limit**, which is usually based on your income.

2. At certain intervals, your company buys stock using the money from your paychecks. I am calling the length between stock purchases the **term**.

3. The price that you purchase the stock at is discounted by two means: The first is a standard percent reduction. I am calling this the **discount**. The second discount is that some companies may allow you to buy stock at a previous close price. Sometimes the price is the close price on the day you started making contributions to buying stock, sometimes it is a date at a fixed period before the stock is purchased; sometimes it is the day the stock is purchased. I am calling this the **lookback price**.

4. If the lookback price is lower than the **market price** on the day that the stock is purchased, stock is purchased at that price. The discount is applied to both prices.

5. You now have company stock. Congratulations. You can sell this stock immediately as a **Disqualified Disposition**. You will pay taxes on the proceeds from the sale just like normal income.

6. You may wait a certain amount of time (usually a year), and then sales of the stock become a **Qualified Disposition**. There are [TAX BENEFITS](http://fairmark.com/execcomp/espp/qualifying.htm) in doing so. It is hairy, and confusing, and even the IRS seems to be confused by the implications. Basically, part of the proceeds will be taxed as capital gains, not income.

First of all, the immediate sale of ESPP stock is a guaranteed return - And not a small one either. You might be tempted to say that there is a return equal to, or greater than your discount. This is not quite right:

---

**A Hypothetical Scenario**:

The *lookback* and *market price* of your company stock are both $100. The *term* is 3 months. Your *discount* is 10%. You chose to contribute $90 over 3 months. Your *tax rate* is 25%.

We first need to know how long your investment is tied up. You may be tempted to say 3 months, but only the initial contribution is going to be held for 3 months. The last contribution may only be held for a day. On average, the investment is tied up for **term / 2** months, or a month and a half.

You buy 1 stock for $90, then immediately sell it for $100. The $10 spread is taxed at 25%, and you end up with $7.50 profit, over an average of 1.5 months. Your return for a month and a half is 7.5/90, or 8.33%. 8% isn't a bad investment, right? Well hold on! That is not the yearly return. We calculate that using this formula:

    (End Value / Beginning Value) ^ (1 / # Years) - 1

This equates to a yearly return of 89.71%. WOW. Oh right, take off a few percent to adjust for inflation. No biggie.

And think! Your returns will be even higher if the lookback price was lower than the market price.

If the *lookback price* were 80, you'd buy $90 worth of shares, at $72 a piece, and sell them for $100 a piece, making $125 dollars. $53 dollars would be taxed, leaving you with $129.75. At an initial investment of $90 over and average of a month and a half, you had a 44.16% return, or a 1,766.03% yearly return WITH ZERO RISK. Still, we have to take a little off for inflation, oh well. There is still **no better place to put your money**.

---

It is a shame that you can't put your whole check in there. It is a damn shame that you can't put your entire wealth pool into an ESPP. You'd billionaire and retired in a few years. But sadly, you can only put a small amount of your pay into it. With a return like that, and no risk, you should be participating to the max.

Even though you can get a bit of money quickly by selling immediately, there are tax breaks for holding the stock. Now, you might think: Tax benefits? Sign me up! Let's take a look at what the gain might be, using a [CALCULATOR](http://twtitw.firebus.com/node/270). (I'm not smart enough to do the math on Qualifying Dispositions. It is a hairy mess, and even the IRS can't keep it straight).

---

**Another Hypothetical Set of Scenarios**:

The *market price* is $100. The *discount* is 10%. Taxes are 25% on income, and 15% on capital gains. The *term* is 3 months. You have $5,000 to invest. Sales become qualified after one year. Inflation is 3%.

I'm going to gloss over the math a bit here, relying on the calculator, and your ability to calculate yearly returns. Basically, the investment time for an immediate sale is 1.5 months, and 13.5 months if you wait for the sale to qualify.

**If the *lookback* price is 100, we can get an immediate profit of $416.67 (89.71% yearly return).**

If we wait until the sale qualifies, the closing price must be...

* 100 to match the profit.

* 100.2647 to match the buying power.

* 100.7941 to match a 9% return.

* 107.9156 to match the 89.71% return.

**If the *lookback* price is 80, our company grew, and we can get an immediate profit of $1,458.33 (674.82% yearly return).**

If we wait until the sale qualifies, the closing price must be...

* 97.6470 to match the profit.

* 98.3880 to match the buying power.

* 99.8705 to match a 9% return.

* Around 264 to match the 674.82% return.

I'm going to say that the investment isn't really worth it unless it beats inflation, and it also beats what else I could have done with that money in a year period (9%). Now, what we need to remember is that no one can predict stock prices a year from now.

---

Yes, your discounts and tax benefits do make it a bit easier to beat a similar investment. It might even make it beat the return of an S&amp;P 500 mutual fund. That's nothing to scoff at, right?

I'm going to go ahead and say WRONG. Dead wrong. The returns are not that much better, and the risk is [literally] infinitely higher.

The risk is not worth it. If you're contributing to an ESPP, you're likely putting 10-15% of your gross annual pay toward it. Would you ever want to gamble that much wealth on the success of one company? Why would you want to have your employee income, and investment income based on the success of one company?

Take the quick, guaranteed, huge return. Invest it in something safer and more diverse.

Don't try to beat the odds by waiting for qualification. The terms change based on previous company growth, and future company growth. There are too many unknowns.

$2,000,000 in brokerage accounts (index funds)

$500,000 in retirement accounts (mostly 401(k), also some Roth)

$215,000 in 529 plans for college for the kids

Home paid for/no mortgage (worth $500k, though I don't think that's too relevant)

No debts

I anticipate drawing about $80k/year to live on, though we could surely manage on less (and will if necessary).

I plan to deal with medical expenses by getting very high-deductible insurance to cover catastrophic illnesses (none anticipated; we're healthy); otherwise will basically just be paying for those.

We drive 5-10-year-old cars (van to transport the kids, who are in the 5-year-old ballpark, and a car); will continue to buy reliable used cars when needed, i.e. when those become too much of a pain and expense to maintain.

I know this post may strike some as obnoxious, since many aren't in as fortunate a position as we are. I feel very lucky and thankful. I've been saving since college but have also had plenty of good luck. Throwaway account.

Oh, retirement in a cost-of-living-index location in the 105-110% range.

I've been figuring this out entirely on my own and would love to error-test it against the collective wisdom here. What am I overlooking?

Thank you all for your counsel.

EDIT: Thank you all for your comments. Many of you have been raising questions that are at the margin between personal finance and philosophy; let me comment some more to address that.

I want to retire so that I can spend more time enjoying and raising my kids. They are little boys now, and they obviously won’t be forever. It does not seem to me that my career is likely to accommodate a 5- or 10-year leave of absence; when I came back I’d be much older than many who wanted my job, with more seniority and baggage, and in a career path (law) that is already quite thoroughly stocked with people, to say the least. So every day has a big opportunity cost, which either must be paid by financial security (if I choose my family over work) or by my family (if I choose work over my family). That is a little bit stark, and is an exaggeration, but I say it to help you understand my motivations.

Now my philosophy. In the big picture I believe that many of us in the privileged first-world West live in bondage to our own fear. We have been taught to be afraid, and so we are. We make decisions from fear, major life choices from fear, and we get up and go to work from fear.  It must not be true that five million, or ten million, is necessary to be safe; if so, then almost nobody is safe. And anyone who has worked to get that much money so that they will be safe won’t feel safe once they have it. The habit of working because of fear doesn’t make you safe, it makes you afraid.

Now, I know that that is a hell of a thing to say in the middle of a nasty recession that genuinely has shattered the plans of many people, and that has left many others struggling. There are real things to be afraid of in the world. That’s what makes it tricky. We have to figure out how to live in a way that enables us to enjoy the good things around us right now every day and also to prepare, in a sensible, calm, happy way, for tomorrow. The wiser practitioners of any major religion and a number of other philosophies can teach a path to this. Financial planning alone can’t begin to touch it. (And I agree with all of you who have said that I need to have something to do when I retire; that’s a piece of the puzzle that I just described.)

So yes, runaway inflation, government confiscation of private savings, a global depression caused by an oil crash, volcanoes, alien invasion, etc. could wreck my plans. And those of everyone else. We all need to keep our eyes open and make adjustments when necessary, but at some point I think that it is madness to continue spending a large portion of one’s time and energy storing away resources for the future. The universe is going to grind down and destroy us all, and what we ultimately fear is death, which money can’t help us avoid. And the future is arriving every moment, and if you spend all of it getting ready for it, you’re missing the point. And then one day you’ll find/ten years have got behind you, and all that.

This doesn’t mean that retirement is any Shangri-la of freedom from fear, or that work is just terror and drudgery. Both are clearly false. A person can be happy and content while working full time; a person can be miserable and wracked with fear while wealthy and retired. Living in fear is the error; it can be committed by anyone. 
So ultimately, I believe that most people will reach a point where their gathering of money has stopped being sensible preparation for the future and has become nothing but fearful hoarding. It’s always quite possible to construct a case for the point not yet having been reached. That doesn’t mean that it hasn’t been, though.

Not incurring debt, saving for emergency, living below my income, investing for retirement and of course living by a budget. I'm not crazy frugal but I've became more of a saver than a spender and it's been great.

However, it seems like great portion of modern economy hinges on the fact that the people over spend. At least from my narrow point of view, most of the things they advertise on TV and things that see at retail stores are mostly luxuries that no one needs.

This got me thinking. What would happen if EVERYONE (including the wealthy and the poor) in the world suddenly stopped over spending, lived under their means, saved and invested like we do here at r/personalfinance?

* Would the world be less or more productive (lower or higher GDP)?
* What industry will fall first and which industries will cease to exist?
* Would the wealthy and poverty gap narrow?
* Would the world economy crumble?
* If the world economy would crumble, are we here at r/personalfinance a secret society that need the rest of the world to be financially irresponsible in order for our savings and investments to thrive?

I thought about posting this to r/economy (maybe I will), but since the last question above is the one that I'm most curious about, I'm posting here first.

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks.

1368734344.0,117,self.personalfinance,1egyxf,"Retirement Calculations, or, How Much Should I Have Saved by Now?",150,33,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1egyxf/retirement_calculations_or_how_much_should_i_have/,"Hi, I'm RedRedditRabbit. You might remember me from previous posts such as ""Why Invest in Bonds at All?"" and ""Can a Middle Class Worker Really Retire in Their 50's?"". Today I'm here to tell you about my most recent calculations. Let's jump into them.

Like all of my posts, we're going to start with a set of assumptions. These are made to allow for these equations to apply to the broadest market possible: the median male US worker bee with a Bachelors degree.

First assumption: You will stop getting real raises in your early 40's. Lots of studies have been conducted on this, the conclusion is that eventually you'll get to a point where your raises each year are only barely keeping up with inflation. For some people it happens in their 30's for some it doesn't happen until their 50's, we're going to use a nice median age of 45.

Second assumption: You started working, and saving, in your early 20's. You don't have to be saving a lot, but hopefully you were saving something.

Third assumption: You won't be getting any social security. This will probably be the most debatable of the assumptions, but we're going to go ahead and plan ahead as if you won't be getting anything from SS. You can adjust these numbers if you feel like you'll be getting a certain amount, but what it boils down to is that it was a lot easier to assume you wouldn't get anything instead of doing a ton of complicated calculations to find how much you might get.

Final assumption: Your investments will return a solid 5% (real) APR over the entirety of your working career. Again, if you don't agree with this, feel free to adjust up (or down) your final numbers.

Lets lay out some math.

We're going to use a **s**afe **w**ithdrawal **r**ate of 4% to plan your retirement years. There are lots of good arguments for and against using a 4% SWR, but, like above, we're going to use this one because it has good data behind it, and it's simple.

A 4% SWR means that is you want to live on $80k per year, you would need 25x that saved up: $2,000k. Only need $30k per year? Multiply by 25 again and you get $750k.

Another good multiplier to keep in mind is 80%. *Generally speaking* retirees spend about 80% of what they would have spent during their working years. So, if you're 65 years old and making $100k and saving 20% of that for retirement, that means you're spending $80k, *that* means that in retirement you'll only need $64k.

So what does this all boil down to? Time for some tables!

If you work for 40 years you'll need to save about 17% of your salary every year. Here's an example of someone that starts working at age 26, and wants to retire at age 65. He should have the following amount saved:

Age	|	Salary Multiple
:--	|	--:
31	|	1x
37	|	2x
41	|	3x
44	|	4x
47	|	5x
51.5	|	7x
55	|	9x
58	|	11x
60.5	|	13x
65	|	17x

So if you're currently 45 years old, and planning on retiring by 65, you should be saving around 17% of your salary, and have about 4-4.5x your salary saved up. (If you make $100k, you should have $400-450k saved.) If you're under that, time to start contributing more!

What if we shorten that time period down? How much should you save if you want to retire in 30 years? You need to save an average of 30% of your income. Let's start at 22 this time and work until we're 51:

Age	|	Salary Multiple
:--	|	--:
25	|	1x
28	|	2x
31	|	3x
34	|	4x
37	|	5x
41	|	7x
45	|	9x
47.5	|	11x
50	|	13x
51	|	14x

At the age of 51, you'd be making $100k, but only spending $70k of that, meaning you'd only need $56k in retirement, which means you need $1400k saved up ($56k * 25 = 14 * $100k).

Here's the formulas you can drop into excel or google to run some simulations yourself (Just don't copy the header part where it says **A B C...**):

Simply drag those 4 right-most columns down to fill in the formulas up to age 65 or wherever you want to stop, and change the values in column B to whatever you want. You can adjust your saving schedule to increase in percentage every year as well.

A couple of things to keep in mind. If you're married, these calculations are for a single person. If your **family** only needs $60k a year in retirement, you don't need to save that all up yourself (unless your spouse doesn't work). If you're female, your salary is more likely to cap out when you're in your late 30s, instead of mid 40's. Sorry, that's just what the research shows happens. If you want to tailor this to your own real &amp; expected salary values instead of using the estimates go ahead, just change the numbers in the ""Salary Estimate"" column to whatever you want, just remember that this is in real values, so if you're going to use the salary you actually made 20 years ago don't forget the inflation.

Once you drop everything into excel, it should look something like this:

We put roughly $2,500 a month on the cards per month. This results in over $1000 in rewards per year.

A few months ago, I saw someone share their method for keeping track of rotating categories using a little paper matrix, which they keep in their wallet. I thought I'd share my method.

I label each card with the relevant rewards: [Back Image](http://i.imgur.com/V7c0qLB.jpg). I also label the front of each card so I can quickly tell which card I should use for each purchase: [Front Image](http://i.imgur.com/siKaFzn.jpg).


Other slightly-relevant details:

* I pay off the balance every month, I've never payed interest on any card.
* Citi ""Thank You Points"" are complicated. I actually get ~4% from the card if I redeem points for Amazon Gift Cards (3% is for cash).
* In the past I've signed up for cards to get a sign-up bonus &gt;$200 (e.g., Sapphire Preferred - $500 bonus), which also boosts my ""cash back."" I may turn the sapphire into a chase freedom instead of cancelling before the yearly fee, but am not a fan of rotating categories.
* All of these cards are easy to manage because I use USAA, which aggregates all of their balances and automates bills (also all other banking, investment accounts, and bills! GO USAA!).
* The bank of america card is seemingly shitty. However, it's an older account, provides free access to museums sometimes, and provides good cash-back through ""add it up"" (e.g., 10%-20% on components for my HTPC build).

I see a lot of threads on here about people who make decent to great salaries and basically recommend living like you make 30k/year.

Well, my SO and I actually make about 35k/year each. The advice most people recommend about being frugal is what we HAVE to do, except we can't save up to 70% of our salary like you'd read on early retirement blogs and stuff. 

I'd like to hear from fellow PFers in the same bracket or close to the same. How are things going? Any tips you could share for those of us who don't make 70k!

Basic advice I'd give is don't live above your means, plan ahead for EVERY expense, maintain a budget/use a budget tool, and contribute anything you can to retirement. You may not be able to max out everything like others, but something is better than nothing!

EDIT: I'm not looking for advice, just wanted to start some good conversations and see how we all handle this situation differently and from different backgrounds.

Turns out, I'm a spendthrift idiot.

I earn good(?) money, pushing $110k before tax. However, instead of saving and investing, I buy drinks and dinner for whomever, pay for ridiculous international travel with friends, and throw money at charities.

 Travel (flights, hotels, cars...) - $20k
 Charities - $5k

edit: thanks!!! you guys have all been really great.I understand that getting another job and working really hard to pay off my bills is what I need to do, I was just wondering if there were extra steps because they were all so past due! Trust me, I'm looking for another job. I have fortunately an excellent work history and am a hard worker. I know I can pay them off, I was just worried if something bad would happen if they were all really past due

to those telling me to go to school, I can't, my transcript is being held hostage for $900. I would like to apply to a different school in my area but need to pay the $900 to get them to release my transcript first. Also, I make money off of freelance art (doing prints, tattoo designs, band posters mostly) and have a following for my art. This is the career path I want and while school would help me a lot, just posting a lot on the internet and making connections with other artists is a route I can take. I've gone through periods of making 400-600/mo on my prints when I was most active (i am still unknown and not popular) so that is another thing I am working hard at

thank you everyone for your congrats on my recovery! thanks for the advice!

Personal Finance (and of course other amazing subreddits including /r/money, /r/Entrepreneur, /r/Frugal and others) have helped me create a safety net, deal with bills and invest better. But a lot of the time the subject of making money is not too heavily touched upon.

A higher income is something everyone desires, but most people assume it is out of their reach. A lot of people wait for things to come to them, and because they don't analyse the possibilities, they can't grasp the opportunities that have already arisen.

I am creating this topic in the hopes that it will be added upon by the great financially minded of reddit, the entrepreneurs and the creative that have succeeded in grasping the opportunities that are so far in your peripheral vision that they can be had to see.


Below is a small list of opportunities that I think are real ways to make money that aren't as conventional as going straight from school to a job and slowly rising the ranks (e.g. the conventional way).

**Money Making**

- *Royalties* - Often considered out of the box but very simple is the concept of royalties. If you can create something that will slowly trickle in money, however slow it might be, you've created an income that is not a one off payment. **Books** can be a great source of income and if you have a love for books, do not be afraid to try writing. ~~**Photography**, or more specifically stock photography, is great for those who are never without their camera and know how to take a nice picture. You can sell your stock photos and receive small payments from each use of the photo. Some people barely leave their camera alone and to make money all they have to do is select some of their nicer photos at the end of the week and sell them.~~ **Web design** is something a large percentage of people know the basics of, but not many people specialize in. Making a website that appeals to a niche community isn't all that hard, and the ads on your site will run you a nice small profit if you can get enough page views. Consider taking online tutorials to bump up your current knowledge of the programming codes and you can find yourself hosting a website dedicated to something you have a great passion for, while turning a decent profit. **Art/drawing**, whether it be drawn with a computer or on hand, can be sold in similar ways to stock photography, even simple logo design can sell for a large profit, as all businesses that start up will need to pay the fee for one. **Music** can be sold in a similar way using sites like [Sound exchange](http://www.soundexchange.com/).

- *Capturing Niche Markets* - Well developed markets can be difficult to enter with severe competition stifling any attempt to enter the business. Niche markets are sometimes difficult to find, and can vary from location to location, but are generally a good investment. It may be a funny thing to consider, but a decent few (in my anecdotal experience) business men have started out on sites such as Craigslist. They learn what the city they are in has a demand for but nearly no supply, and they advertise on Craigslist with huge interest. For example, someone with carpentry skills could easily find out that the location they're in has a lot of upper-middle class cat lovers and could create [cat castles](http://www.crazycatcondos.com/rocketcattree.jpg) with 30 dollar worth of material, which would sell rather easily on Craigslist for hundreds, depending on the quality. If you can't build one, buy bulk quantities and set them up then sell them for a decent, but smaller, profit.

- *Flipping* - Flipping is basically the same as before, but discludes making your own things. Basically the age old 'buy low; sell high' mindset is what you need here. This might include buying some special deal and selling it higher. It might include making deals with companies (e.g. to sell their televisions) when they request 300 dollars from each unit and you can sell each for 800 dollars.

- *High pay work* - This may sacrifice love of work for love of money. Simply put, some jobs are ridiculously easy and yet pay a ton of money. Working in mines or on oil rigs generally gets you a shitload of money for a very small amount of danger. Be prepared for intensive labor in some cases though. You may want to consider working in a high pay job for one or two years to set yourself up financially before you go for your dream job or increase your knowledge through education. If anyone knows any high paying jobs such as these I'd love to hear them.

A small majority of people use their spare time for things such as filling in surveys, which has a rough pay rate of 1 dollar or so an hour. I can't stress enough how much of a waste of time this is. Of course it is great to earn more money outside of work, and what is easier that sitting on your computer partially on Facebook? May I recommend something better? Gain skills in an area that could make you decent profit, research you city for what you could sell there, even going to your neighbors and asking if they'd like their lawn mowed for 10 bucks if a much higher pay rate.

*This is just my contribution to the thread, be a nice guy and contribute with your own knowledge or experience. There are many ways to skin a cat*

If I can stress one thing here, it is to not just think this is all interesting information, but to truly think about what I said and think outside of the box when it comes to making money.

Let me breakdown what has happened since I've been here:

* 2009 starting salary: $30,000
* 2010 annual performance review: $32,000
* 2011 annual performance review: $37,000
* 2012 annual performance review: $40,000
* 2012 Job promotion: $43,000

In 2012, I found out quite a few pieces of a puzzle that now perplexes me.  There was a former employee that was performing a similar job that had been with the company for ~15 years that was earning $67,000 (found a copy of a recent performance review while cleaning up her desk that I now sit at).  A new employee who joined my team who is directly under me landed a starting salary of $45,000 (he left a pay-stub on his desk, I looked but did not touch).  Another co-worker showed me that he is being paid $47,000 for a similar job.  Another co-worker told me that she is going for the same job I have and asked me if I'm making at least $55,000, because she wont do it for less.

* I arrive early every day, and stay later than I need to.
* I do all that is asked of me and more.
* I have taken on numerous extra responsibilities.
* I am always flexible when asked to be.
* Every person that previously held my position has left the company because the job is too stressful and very demanding.

I just feel like I'm doing something wrong.  Is my employer knowingly paying me so little because they feel like they can?  My next performance review is next month, but I feel like even if the raise is ""good"", all of my peers are so far ahead of me it's just upsetting and depressing.  I'm thankful to have a job, and I do enjoy the work I perform, I would just like to be fairly rewarded for doing it.

I'm thinking that I should bring this up during my performance review next month, but if the raise is decent I don't want to be seen as greedy and ask/demand for more.  I also don't want to jeopardize my job by doing anything crazy.  I'm thinking my salary will be adjusted to $45-47k, and that's okay but I think it should be closer to $50k.  Should I make a list of everything I'm doing and be prepared to ask for more during the review, or should I bring this up now? 

I did not give any specifics about the job because I don't want to give too much away.  All I'll say is that I live in an area that is not in a major city, hence why the salaries I'm discussing seem low, but the average household income where I live is $35k according to the 2012 Census.

I grew up really poor. My mom was on welfare, we lived in section 8 housing, the standard poor American set, basically. My senior year of high school, our house was foreclosed, I had a nervous breakdown, we were almost homeless and my mom moved away. I slumped through my senior year (I had been a 4.0 student), put off applying to college and sunk myself into a dead end job.

Fast-forward three years. I get laid off my job, and I am absolutely hopeless. Insanely broke, but keeping a roof above my head. My state releases a program for people on unemployment to go back to college for free. I get some weird streak of optimism, apply, get accepted and head back to school.
Fast-forward four more years. I have graduated from college, got a prestigious fellowship, get a great job. Success! I make a bunch of money, I love my life.

But you guys. My finances are totally out of control. I am 25, I have no kids, but I blow every last cent. I make about $60,000 a year (in my part of the country, that is about double the average income), and I have no savings.

I have about $40,000 in student loan debt and $7,000 on my car. Thankfully I've avoided credit-cards and have no debt, but alas, also very little credit.

I am a contractor, so I have to pay my taxes out of pocket. I spend so much that paying these is difficult. In fact, this month I got my account garnished by the IRS.

I just don't know what's wrong with me. I have went to therapy, which only resulting in another bill to pay. I buy...everything. Fancy dinners, stupid things from Anthropologie...vacations. Everything. I'm a smart girl, but I get nervous when I have money in the bank. It just feels...imaginary...insecure? I don't know.

It's like I am terrified of having a dollar to my name. I have never had money. I don't know how to have it or manage it. Why don't they teach these things in college? My parents are terrible influences, and also have no savings and very insecure finances.

I was recently offered a great job with a very generous company.  Full benefits, retirement match, etc., plus its just a great company to work for--everyone I've ever spoken with loves this business and what it stands for. Applying for this job was a bit of a long shot--I have experience doing everything the job requires, but little direct experience with the actual job.  But, I fit in with the company culture well, and they offered me the job!  Unfortunately they offered me the very bottom of their salary range.  Should I negotiate for a little more, or thank my lucky stars that I got this job and leave well enough alone?  I think some of my guilt over asking for more stems from the fact that I feel lucky to have gotten this job at all, and the company is generous in other ways.  But a little more would be nice, and I have reasons I can offer for why I deserve to start a little higher up--I'm just conflicted!  Please advise!

Now what?",137,28,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1a3y6i/just_made_last_student_loan_payment_paid_off/,"I am 23 years old and graduated in May 2011 with a bachelor's in IT Management.  I was lucky enough to get a job in my field of study starting at $51K.  I started the job in September 2011 and made my first loan payment in November 2011.  I was able to pay off $5K on my first payment, and then paid around $1050-$1300 each month for the following 15 months.  In Sept. 2012, my salary got bumped up to $53K.

My initial goal was to have everything paid off by the end of 2013, so it feels great to have exceeded that goal.  This was my only source of debt during this time.  I definitely could have paid everything off earlier, but thought it would be important to starting building up for retirement and my savings - even if not a lot.  During this time, I contributed 6% of each paycheck to my 401K - which is the max amount of what my company will match.  On top of that, I started a Roth IRA in which I made the minimum contribution of $100 a month.  I have also been able to build up around $20K in my savings account (I had around $3K when I started working).  I definitely could have put a lot of this towards my student loans, but was happy with my current monthly payment amounts and having that strong base in my savings is important to me.

My question to you is now what should be my next financial step/goal?  I drive a 2000 Toyota Camry which is still running good, but I would be lying if I said a new ride didn't sound nice.  I also plan on moving into a nicer place this summer.  I feel that the $20K in my savings account is a strong base that I will continually build, but I know I shouldn't be throwing all the money I didn't have before in it.  Should I increase my 401K/Roth IRA contributions?  If so, how much?  If I am considering a new car in the future, how much should I have saved up?  What else should I be considering?

Finally - a curveball question.  I have the opportunity to move to NYC this summer making $64K.  With all things considered, I think I would probably be in a better financial situation making $53K in my current city compared to $64K in NYC.  However, I wouldn't mind taking a slight hit for the chance to live there.  Is it even possible to live comfortably in NYC making $64K?  Keep in mind that I currently have no debt, but would be moving alone and looks like I would need to be making $1600-$1800 rent payments (from my understanding).

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help.

I decided to take a whack at a priority list on how to apply your regular or windfall income with an eye toward long-term wealth building. This list reflects how I would do things, but I figured I would throw this out to the forum for comment/discussion with an eye toward adding it to the FAQs (some of this has been addressed, but I’m trying to flesh out a more detailed step-by-step plan in terms of how excess income is applied).

Note that the goal is to complete each item before moving to the next. Most of us won't be able to do all of these things, but the further you can work down the list, the better in terms of wealth building.

One last thing:  I’m not sure how to factor in HSAs.  My gut feeling is that it should be tiered in some fashion much like the retirement savings goals I’ve outlined (e.g., save up to $2k in HSA after step 3, add $2k after step 6, max out after step 9).  Thoughts?

Proposed priority list:

**1. Keep all debts/accounts current**

Pay your monthly minimums on time. This is critical to ensure that your credit rating remains strong.

**2. Create a 1 month emergency fund (equal to one month of expenses)**

Life throws curve balls sometimes, be ready.

**3. Take advantage of employer retirement match**

Tax deferred saving + a guaranteed return (courtesy of your employer) is a major wealth builder.

**4. Pay down high interest debts (after tax interest &gt; 12%)**

High interest debt quickly erodes wealth building.

**5. Create a 2 month emergency fund**

More curve ball readiness.

**6. Pay down moderate interest debts (after tax interest &gt; 5%)**

Paying off debts is a guaranteed zero risk return, over 5% is far better than you can find elsewhere.

**7. Contribute to Roth IRA/401k up to $10k total.**

Building the nest egg. Generally speaking, if you are 40 years old and/or are in a lower tax bracket, focus upon Roth IRA after the company match has been reached. If you are 40 or over and/or are in a higher tax bracket, focus upon the 401k (or other pretax accounts like 403b or IRA).

**8. Create a 3 month emergency fund**

3 months of expenses is a reasonable long-term goal.

**9. Liquid savings up to $10k/year**

Good for special purchases (car, house, vacations, whatever)

**10. Max out retirement contributions.**

Nest egg-o-rama.

**11. Pay off low interest loans (after tax interest &lt; 5%).**

Debt free is the way to be!

**12. Add to liquid savings.**

Just because you can.

My wife and I bought our first house back in the spring of 2010 and got the $8,000 tax credit (thanks, Obama).  I've put about $10,000 into remodeling the house since I've owned it, and I refinanced it last fall to get a better rate ($117,000 @ 3.875%).  We're thinking about moving into something bigger and closer to work eventually, and now that mortgage rates are starting to creep back up I'm thinking it might be best to move sooner rather than later so I can lock in a good rate on a more ""permanent"" house.  The question is, should I rent our house out or sell it?

The mortgage on the house is a 7/1 ARM at 3.875%.  I am about six months into the seven years.  The total payment right now is $752/month; that includes P&amp;I, insurance, and taxes.  We don't pay PMI because of the bank's loan program we got our mortgage through.  (Note: I took the ARM option to get a half-point better rate and because I knew we wouldn't be in that house for anywhere near seven years.  If we decide to rent it out, I'll either sell it or refinance it before the seven years is up.)

If we sell, I expect to make about $15,000 on the sale before realtor fees.  The main advantages of selling are 1) money for a down payment on the next place, 2) that house won't be our problem anymore, and 3) no landlord headaches.  I didn't have to put any money down on this house, but I may have to on the next one.  Plus, the house was built in the mid-90s, so it may need a new AC unit, furnace, and/or roof soon.  By selling it, I pass those things on to the next owner.

If we rent it out, I can reasonably expect to get $1100-1200/month for it based on Zillow's estimate and my knowledge of the area.  It's a nice house in a safe part of the city with good schools.  There are several other houses with renters in them in my neighborhood, and the area seems to attract stable, long-term tenants.  If I am able to get $1150/month in rent, that's a gross profit of $4800 per year.  The best case scenario is that I don't have to make any major repairs to the property and can pocket most of that money every year.  That will help tremendously with paying down student loans and such, or I can just roll it into the mortgage on the rental property and rack up equity faster.  The worst case scenario is that I have to replace all three of the major systems I mentioned before: roof, AC, and furnace.  In that case, I'd be out at least $20k, so I'd have to rent it out for over five years just to break even.  However, even in that case, I'd have five extra years of equity under my belt and a house with all new major systems.  Even if I wanted to sell it at that point, I'd still have a year left on my 7/1 deal before the rate adjusts and the house would arguably be an easier sell with all new systems (to be clear, I'm not worried about selling the house now; it's in great shape and the local market is on the upswing).  

What do you guys think?  This is sort of in the baby-steps phase for us; my wife and I are thinking the best thing to do is wait until next spring either way.  I am just trying to get all the information I can between now and then.

**Edit: Thanks to everyone who commented here with advice and personal experience stories.  The two things that stick out to me the most from everyone's advice and/or questions are: if we go the rental route, we will need to bank whatever profit we take in as a rainy-day fund for the rental, to cover repairs, tenant turnover, and non-payment.  Also, since I don't have the income to qualify for a second house unless I can count the rental income toward my DTI ratio, I need to talk to some mortgage lenders and find out if this is even doable at this time.

I'm 27 years old and I work as a software developer in manhattan. I have been working at this software company for 3.5 years now and enjoy the people and the work.  I am living in my parents 4br house with my 3 younger siblings at the moment.  I lived in apartments around New York City for about 2 years when I first started this job but never was able to fit in with any community so I moved back in with my parents after feeling some homesickness.

I've saved $57k in a savings acct and an extra $14k in a traditional ira, I own a 2008 sedan, have $15k left in student loans (most below 2% interest, but $7k of it is at 5%), and my salary is $75k with a bonus of about $30k at the end of the year.  I'm also single and have never been in a serious relationship.

Given my current financial and living situations, I'd really appreciate if anyone could advise me on how to move on to the step of life.  Some ideas I have been thinking of are buying an apartment near NYC, buying a home, renting an apartment in NYC, pursue a graduate degree, look for a higher paying job, or traveling somewhere in or out of the country perhaps. But those are just some general ideas.

I come from ""lower-middle"" class parents and I'm doing my best to work hard and smart to come up from where I grew up. Now that I've earned and saved some money I'm not entirely clear on how to responsibly utilize it. My siblings are still very young (25,21,14) and thus, still poor and don't earn close to what I earn.  My mother is a minimum wage cashier and my father earns $70k/year as an IT guy but most of his money is spent paying his mortgage ($90k remaining) and paying a debt of $250k he owes from failed business ventures in his past (which I think he'll never be able to repay)

My two most serious goals are to 1) enter into a long term relationship with a girl, and 2) to not let my money sit around, collect dust, wondering what could've been.

There is the chance that this price would qualify me for federal financial aid (currently, my parents are in that dreaded make-too-much-to-receive-aid-yet-barely-make-enough-to-afford-tuition limbo), and scholarships are available (although my GPA disqualifies me from many merit-based scholarships). The overwhelming likelihood is that there will be a large amount that will have to come out of pocket.

Not going would definitely be regretful, but I'll live. The youth in me is screaming reminders that ""explore the world and make dumb mistakes while you can"" mentality, but the impending adult wants to make sure this can happen in a way that won't cause even more regret for years to come.

PF is right though, in that my subjective personal benefit must outweigh any objective financial cost. As of right now, it looks like my plan is:
&gt;
&gt;1. Take Semester at Sea only if I can make the longshot and become an RA for them, otherwise, it is far too expensive and not worth it.
&gt;2. Look into other study abroad opportunities through my university, as cost of living may end up reducing prices overall. A more manageable amount of debt is acceptable, but within reason.
&gt;3. Look into post-graduation teaching opportunities, as these can be paid stays abroad.
&gt;4. Save and set aside a portion for a travel fund, perhaps for a gap year if life permits.

We live very very modestly - tiny one bedroom apt. in a bad area (like, I saw a guy shooting heroin behind my apt. building a few days ago, bad) and don't have much debt (only my student loans).  We don't have any possessions of any value to sell (iphones and decent laptops, an oldish TV setup, but everything else in the apt. is used Ikea furniture and things from craigslist).

Debts:

Student Loan: 40k

I can max my 401k and Roth contributions every year going forward at bonus time.

We both come from very poor families, so getting a loan from family for a downpayment is not possible.

I'm reaching out to all of you today because the reality of my situation just hit me, and I'm on the verge of a full-blown panic attack. 

I'm 27, and I work as an intern architect. I make $20 an hour and just can't make ends meet anymore. Here's why:

When I was in college, I stupidly took on heaps of credit card debt on top of student loans. After two years of being unemployed, my finances spiraled out of control and now I can't keep my head above water. I had to rack up more debt to keep myself alive, and now I'm paying for it. I've had to borrow money from friends and family to pay rent/eat/seek medical care, and my inability to pay anyone back has alienated me and I can't get financial help anywhere.

I've been doing my best to track my expenses, and here's what I've got:

Rent: $965
Health Insurance: $215 + $183 for necessary meds
Private Loan: $202
Federal Loan: $165
Credit Cards: $320
Cell Phone: $94
Utilities: $133
Groceries: $200
Public Transportation: $86

Total Expenditures: $2563.00
Monthly Pay: $2432.00

I spend more than I make, and I don't know what to trim. Please help me figure this out.

EDIT: I'm completely floored by the response this has generated. Thank you all so much! 

Per your suggestions, I'm switching to Virgin Mobile for the $35 fee, calling today to get my student loans deferred, and looking into moving to reduce my living expenses! Thanks so much for all of your advice!

My parents are currently in their early 60's. They own a small business and are currently still spending most of their time running the business. They are considering possibly retiring soon in which case they will have a lot more free time and a lot more cash to invest. My parents have signed up for a course with this company to learn how to actively invest their savings. The course is run by: http://www.tradingacademy.com/

Does anyone have any experience with this company? I'm curious if anyone has had any good or bad experiences to share. I don't think its a scam necessarily but I for one think it is a really bad idea for them to sign up for this. The company charges 5 figures for their classes which I think is a LOT. The price of the course is almost 10% of what they would be investing so if they take this course, they are starting down 10%! On top of how pricey it is, I also don't think it is a good idea for them to actively invest their money. Neither of them come from finance backgrounds. My parents argue that they are currently paying a financial adviser to invest their money and he doesn't do a very good job so the course would pay for itself after a couple years. My opinion is that they should get rid of the financial adviser, read a couple books and passively invest their money in very conservative investments like index funds.

Here's some charts I use to track my finances, with some commentary: http://imgur.com/a/nj4qv

Obviously ""financial independence"" was the wrong word for ""debt free day"". I did reach my goal in 2011 of maxing my 401k (TSP) and Roth, and then did the same again in 2012. I picked a great time to jump into the market; my first 12 months return was 20.41% and I'm looking at another 20%+ return again this year (knock on wood). I know it won't always be like this.

I'm no longer debt free, as last summer I took the plunge and bought my dream car. 1996 Porsche 911 Carrera 4S, BLK/BLK, 76k miles. Ironically, this is what started me down my current financial path...about 5 years ago I wanted to buy one of these, and made a post stating as much on a Porsche fan site. I was immediately besieged with posts like ""Do you have a 6-month emergency fund? Have you maxed your 401k and Roth IRA's for the year?""...and my reaction was - what the hell are those?? So I started learning about investing, and slowly started to turn my financial life around.

1358802842.0,105,self.personalfinance,170f9f,Advice for someone who 'vanished' from creditors almost 7 years ago,142,37,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/170f9f/advice_for_someone_who_vanished_from_creditors/,"Now that it is 2013 I would like some advice from you guys as this is the year my debts I skipped out from hit 7 years old or older.

My story (if it matters) began 7 years ago (give or take a few months) when I had a great job making 75K+ a year in a small town with low cost of living so that 75k felt more like 125k. I was in a long term live together relationship with someone younger than myself who did not have much credit so the house, both cars, loans, credit cards, etc were all in my name but her pay of around $30k helped pay the bills. We lived beyond our means and racked up bills left and right trying to keep up with the Jones.

Then I lost my job due to the company merger/buyout, girlfriend left me around that same time leaving me with the debts that were all in my name anyway so she walked away clean, and the stress of it all led to my drug use and general self pity attitude. I got a job that paid nowhere near the same thanks to a fellow drug user and tried to pay what I could (after drug purchases) but was falling back further and further. This lasted maybe 6 months.

As the house was close to foreclosure with the mailbox full of bills, as I watched the tow trucks take my cars, and as my cell phone rang off the hook from bill collectors up until that was turned off for nonpayment...I called up my mother and explained my drug addiction and that I couldn't stay at the job I had as I needed to severe all ties to drug buddies.

So that's when I packed up, moved home, and 'fell off the grid' for the last 7 years. No change of address of course, just vanished from my obligations. I got clean quick and found work after about a year where I could but it never was a long term job so if debt collectors were trying to track me via employment I was probably gone by the time they sent any garnishment letter. I would say I had about 5-6 jobs during this time but there all part time short term things lasting a month or so then more unemployment. I used cash for everything including paying my mom each month for a car she gave me the cash to buy. My phone was a prepaid.

I moved into a apartment 2 years ago with a new girlfriend but we both use cash for everything and neither use credit. The apt, electric, cable is all in her name as I have been terrified that anything would flag me in some system somewhere and creditors would be all over me within a week wanting hundreds of thousands of dollars from a guy who makes $20k a year barely making it. I love my job - it just doesn't pay much. I've worked there for about 3 years now and never got any garnishment letter or anything. No letters at my mom's house neither which is what my driver's license shows as my residence.

So, the point of this long winded post is this is the year my debts hit that 7 year age that if I understand correctly must vanish off my credit reports. I did peak at my credit report once about a year ago and it's basically like a time capsule from 7 years ago with phone numbers and addresses from my old life. I've seen where debts have been sold and resold to various debt collector companies which seem to refresh the dates so they appear not to be 7 years old.

Do I simply sign up with all 3 credit report companies and start disputing everything down the page as 'over 7 years old' and watch it all vanish after a month or two or will it be more complicated than that? Or...are there some debts that do not go away after 7 years? For insight my debts consisted of a house foreclosure, 2 cars repossessed, several credit cards, utility bills, and a loan or two from local finance companies. Total debt in my name 7 years ago was if I had to guess maybe around $160k-$175K.

UPDATE: Thanks to some comments so far I looked up my state. Statute of limitations on loans and general debt is 6 years; credit cards is generally 4 years. Court judgements for my state have a 12% interest rate and they also have a statute of limitation of 7 years from the judgement date. This might explain why I haven't been contacted in the last year or so now that my life is easily track-able through tax returns and stable employment. So even though they are on my credit report some or possibly all of the debts have expired past their statute of limitations.",,False,,t5_2qstm,1358829019.0,,,True,t3_170f9f,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/170f9f/advice_for_someone_who_vanished_from_creditors/,

Full quote (responding to this point - ""Around 75 percent of the index tracks government securities or other types of government-backed bonds. Less than 25 percent is in corporate bonds.""): 
&gt; Because of this, says John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group, total bond indexes “are deeply flawed — and that’s coming from an indexer.”  He adds that individual investors should keep only about one-third of their bond stake in Treasuries and government debt, reflecting the market’s mix based on private investors such as pension and mutual funds.  

&gt; Investors might consider keeping half their money in a total bond market fund, he said, while shifting the other half to an intermediate corporate bond fund. By doing so, investors would end up with an overall strategy that’s about two-thirds in corporate debt and one-third in government securities.

I was looking into asset allocation strategies tonight, and this quote jumped out at me. I know /r/PF is full of Bogleheads, but I never see anyone recommending anything other than the Total Bond Market Fund (VBMFX), and occasionally the Total Int'l Bond Market Fund (VTABX). Why is that? If I want to follow his advice, can any of you recommend a good intermediate corporate bond fund for my portfolio? (I'm going to assume the answer is VCIT, but are there any non-ETFs Vanguard offers that I'm missing?)

**EDIT:** For those of you that are curious how you could achieve what Bogle is suggesting with Vanguard funds, you could do a 50/50 split of VBMFX &amp; VFICX and you'd end up with about 37% U.S. gov't debt and 63% investment grade corporate bonds.

About a year ago, I took out a payday loan (about 200) to help a quick fix. Now, jump ahead to today, I'm stuck with about 6 payday loans out that I can't pay off. All total around 2500. The one payday loan I first took out was fine, but when I saw I might miss a payment on that, I took out another to cover that. This is basically how I got the 6 and how this has gone out of hand. I blame myself for my lack of financial knowledge, but..  now I just need solutions.

I only make 600 a check, which is enough to cover one, but all 6 six hit my bank at once then I get slapped with return fees.

I looked into debt consolidation loans, but I have no idea where to look. Called a couple banks, and got turned down. Ideally, I'd like to turn these loans into one lump &amp; pay that down.

That doesn't even make sense. :/ I feel like such a fuck up.

I'm mid-twenties. Currently I'm subleasing my girlfriend's apartment while she's away. She's back and forth if she wants to move, I think it's a good idea as we aren't sure if her landlord would grant me a lease, too.  I've been looking at places with a friend, we found a couple in the 600-800 range. They're all two bedroom as his lease is ending in August, too and he needs a new place to live.

I have problems though. I have about 13k in debt -- half of that is my car and half of that is credit card. My rating is in the dumps (about 575 the last time I checked). The card debt is split over four accounts: one with 5100$, one with 1000$, one with 400$ (only one that isn't maxed out, limit is 1000$ and is strictly with a garage) and one with ~600$ that is in collections. I have another account in collections that I contested and it hasn't been acted on (it's for 600$ but only 300$ of the debt is valid*, I offered to settle with the phone company if they'd adjust it to what it should have been, but they wouldn't and sent me to collections). I don't have interest rates on hand right now, but I should be able to get them fairly easily. I know my car and biggest card have the highest interest.

My bills break down this way:
Car -- 240$
Phone -- 116$ (I know I should probably cancel my smart phone plan, but I don't have 300$ to do that)
Insurance -- 103$ (down from the 170$ I was paying like a dipshit)
CC1 - 150$
CC2 - 40$ (minimum is 30$)
CC3 - 20$ 
CC4 - 25$ (autodrafts from my account)
Rent for me is about 200$ (total rent is 400$, she's paying half of it)
Utilities are usually about 50$ for me.
________________________________
944$

Gas for me is about 20-30$ a week depending on how much I drive. Work is about 4 miles from where I live, if I only go to work and home (typical) I can stretch 30$ over about a week and a half. I recently fixed some issues with my car so hopefully this improves.
Food -- I spent 50$ yesterday and I'm hoping to stretch that a week and a half, maybe two. I don't eat much myself -- usually the equal of two meals a day.


I work about 38 hours a week (retail, so no set schedule). Currently, I make about 12.5$ an hour but I know I'm getting a pay cut (probably at the beginning of July) -- best case scenario is 10%, putting me at 11.25$ I can remain solvent in that case. Worst case? If I dip below 10.50$ I don't think I can. :/

I'm not going to make excuses, I've made plenty of mistakes and now I owe a lot of money. My choices were ultimately my own.

I love my girlfriend and I want to live with her. I realize that it may not be possible, however. Regardless of if we move, stay here or I have to move, I need to do two things: save some money (my savings is at 2.15$ right now) and come up with a plan to get rid of my debt. I realize neither will be easy.

Basically, I need advice. I don't have any assets to sell (I have books, but nothing worth of value). I have an old tower I use as a personal server that may be worth 50$, a laptop that is basically my life, a monitor and speaker set that might fetch 100$ together, 200$ if I'm lucky. I'd hate to see them go, but I could live with it.

I'm thinking of getting a second job overnight to earn extra money. The prospect of being even more exhausted all the time isn't enticing but I'd rather be tired than homeless. :/

This has turned into a dumping ground of all my insecurities. I'm sorry, I just really need advice on what I should be doing because I have no fucking idea.

After calling the DoE a second time, this operator named a different collections agency that was servicing the loans. This operator was also able to tell us more information about where the loan was dispersed, and it was the same university that my wife went to.

I was doing a lot of reflecting after that post yesterday about the person in $240,000 of debt. 

Take someone who made the decision to go to college ~5 years ago. They made their decision prior to the economic crash of 2008. The cultural zeitgeist at that moment in time did not include discussions about student loans, or at least, it did not to the extent it does today. Neither was there the shifting focus from ""go to the best college you can"" to ""go to the college you can afford"" or even ""have you considered not going to college.""

I am now realizing the perhaps society's message to young people is changing, or at least, should be changing. Now, I think the message is, if you are wealthy (can afford to pay for college) or exceptionally talented (can get full scholarships), then yes, pursue your dreams! 

However, if you are not either of those things, think hard about what you want to do. You may not be able to afford college. Even if you can afford college, you likely may not be able to afford to study what you're passionate about at the moment you enter college. 

I think it's time to be realistic given the cost of higher education. The message to high schoolers should be: unless you have funds available to you, are exceptionally talented or have a passion for something that dovetails with a profession that's lucrative (say engineering, for example), then chances are you cannot go to college and study what you're interested in. 

Your choices are then: (i) screw college and pursue what you're interested in with all your time and energy, with the understanding that you might be poor but you're at least not beholden to student loans, (ii) pick something more lucrative that you're less interested in, but that will provide for a debt free life within a reasonable period of time or (iii) mitigate the cost of college by going to community college first and then go to a cheap state college (though, even here, loans could be an issue depending on what is studied).

What do you think, PF? Should there be a more concerted effort to change social consciousness away from ""you can do whatever you want to!""?

Growing up, most of the family fights centered around money. I remember watching from the stairs as my mother cut up the credit cards with tears in her eyes. I don't want to go down that road. 

Now I've been thinking a lot about my personal finances lately thanks to Reddit. Although I always found the finance world fascinating, and held a subscription to the economist for a few years, it always seemed like finance was something the money-minded or big-boys did. But since I've been following r/personalfinance I know the sooner I develop a financial plan the better. 

It might have taken a little longer - but thanks to an employee education discount and transferring from community college; I managed to graduate from a respectable state school without any student loans. After graduation I took the first job offer I could find. Working as a secretary at a construction firm brings home about 30K a year. Although it might not sound like much to most of you - it's the most I've ever made. 

I've been working there for about 5 months. I have a 2,500 rainy-day fund in the bank. There are five years between me and the big 3 - 0. I want to build up passive income and start my own business eventually. Right now I just have two main concerns: 

* My biggest problem at the moment is my complete and total lack of credit. I've always been terrified of debt so I never signed up for a credit card. Everything has been paid for in cash. My phone is under a family plan still. The bills have always been in my roommates name. When I was 21 it seemed like everyone was throwing credit applications at me. Now that I'm 25 and in a much better position financially - **no one will give me a credit card** . I just don't get it! Help??


* I was hoping some more knowledgable members could offer tips on how to start an investment plan. Do I even make enough money to start investing? Some blogs advise high-risk strategies for twenty-somethings others point to long-term low-risk early retirement strategies. Isn't the college debt bubble coming soon anyway, so should I stay away from the market? Or should I save up more $$ and let it just sit in a savings account?

Recently, I’ve been binge reading financial help books and starting to get serious about getting my ducks in order.  My wife and I are 29 and 28, respectively.  We are both good about paying down debt, but are absolutely horrible savers.  This is an issue because we tend to accumulate literally nothing in the way of savings.

BASICS
1.  Combined income of $6800 / month (after pension contributions)
2.  We work the same job (Ontario teachers) and so have a very good pension plan that we have been paying into for 6 years or so.   We also have tremendous job security, which would explain the lack of emergency savings.
3.  I have ~$20,000 from an inheritance that is sitting in mutual funds/TFSA.  I was contributing about $150 / month to this, but have decided to stop to get rid of the debt and develop emergency savings.

DEBTS

1.  We have a LOC (5%) of $6000 for our honeymoon (traveling March 2014) that we need to clear.
2.  $7900 on my car left to pay (at 1.9% interest).  Wife’s car is paid in full.
3.  Our Credit Cards are paid in full each month.

MY CURRENT PLAN:

I developed a detailed budget and decided to apply the Ramsey method of aggressively paying down each debt and going from there.  My plan is to aggressively attack the Line of Credit, then the car, and then aggressively develop about $10,000 in emergency savings.  From there, I will continue to boost the emergency savings while kicking back into the mutual funds and aggressively pay down the only remaining debt at that point, the house.  It will take about 18 months, to reach the debt free zone (other than the mortgage).

My questions are:

-	I scare myself all the time that I’m so old and have screwed up my finances so bad I’m going to be broke when I ‘m older.  Are we doing horribly?
-	Is it wise to do things one at a time, or should I be contributing to investments/emergency fund at the same time as I pay down the honeymoon and the car?
-	If we have a good pension through work (people always tell us it’s gold plated), how much should we be realistically contributing to retirement savings on top of this?
-	Any other suggestions?

EDIT:  

1.  Thanks so much for all of the great advice!

2.  Sorry guys, I should have given a bit more information.  We haven’t been totally useless in the sense that we spent the last few years paying for/paying off/saving for the down payment on the house, furniture, closing costs, our wedding and a couple of house reno’s to increase the value.

(CA),128,33,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1dxg2u/my_credit_card_has_been_sitting_maxed_or/,"I'm a student. With my first credit card (from MBNA), I was responsible, I only made purchases I could pay for immediately or with my next paycheck, and always paid on time. My bank kept asking me if I wanted a Visa from them, I refused for about a year and then finally decided to take them up on it since my first credit card wasn't giving me anything, and this one was no fees and 1% cash back. 19.99% interest on purchases/22.99% on cash advance. Started with a $1000 limit on both.

As soon as I had two credit cards though, I quickly discovered that I couldn't handle them, and paid off the first one and let it expire. Last year I had a chunk of tuition left to pay at the end of the year, and my credit card was already sitting at about max. I got a summer job but I was barely able to pay rent and living costs and pay off the rest of my tuition with the hours they gave me, so I couldn't make any significant payments to my credit card.

I moved to France for exchange and there were far more initial expenses than I was told, so I had to call the bank and get a credit increase of $500 so I could pay my rent deposit. Ever since then, it has been sitting around max. I make payments of $100-200 every month or two, when I can, to get it under the maximum, but I have had to use it quite a bit, so it always creeps back up.

I am coming back to Canada and getting another summer job in a few weeks. I am in the same situation as last year, having to pay some tuition that I failed to pay this year. My rent will be cheaper, but I'm worried that I still won't be able to pay off my credit card.

How badly is this affecting me? Will it affect my ability to buy a house or a car 5-10 years down the road? Is there anything I can do to cut some of my payments in the meantime?

When we were living a little more paycheck to paycheck, we were having trouble with our monthly bills given our biweekly incomes. Our bills were not evenly spread out through the month. This caused our accounts to look pretty good when we got paid during the middle of the month, but pretty bad when we got paid around the first. We would have to worry not only about the cost of these bills, but when they were going to be paid as well.

What I did was set up another checking account with our bank to pay all of these bills. I seeded this account with $1000 of savings to prevent overdrafts due to timing. Then I calculated the biweekly cost of each of these bills. For varying bills like utilities, I used a conservative average, just to be safe. To find the biweekly cost given the monthly cost, you can multiple the monthly cost by 12 and divide by 26. Adding all of these together, I was able to determine the total biweekly cost of these bills. From there, I set up a biweekly automatic transfer for this amount from my direct deposit account to my new bill pay account. Alternatively, some companies will split a direct depost to multiple accounts, but the transfer is easier for me to change if some bill changes.

This made things much easier on us. We were able to stop worry about a few bills coming up together and really focus on fixing other budget categories. I am more able to check our main checking account to see how we are doing without worrying when some bill is going to autopay. This is probably common sense for many of you, but it really helped our budget click.",,False,,t5_2qstm,False,,,True,t3_187o0f,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/187o0f/tip_for_handling_monthly_bills_on_biweekly_incomes/,

Thank you for the responses so far. To clarify something:

Yes, he is definitely encouraging it. I have been pushing back, namely because of advice I've received from here and examination of my current situation. His goal is more to ""gift"" me, because he has helped my siblings in a similar manner. Because I've been pushing back, giving me the cash is his way ""being done with it"". If I decide eventually home ownership is not my thing he would not be opposed to me going down a different route with the money.

How should I diversify my savings?",130,35,144,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/19ohzd/22_years_old_and_putting_1000month_into_cds_how/,"Right now, I’m financially lost. I’m saving as much as I can, but recently, I got a feeling I’m not saving it wisely.

Personal details: I earn about $40,500 a year ($3380/month). I just started working a year ago, after I graduated college, and I’m 22 years old, going on 23 soon. No debt.


**Monthly expenditures:**

* Gas, food, entertainment: $240 to $350

* Rent: $820

* Direct deposit to savings account (CDs): $1,000 ($1,000 is the minimum at my Credit Union to make a CD; current rate is 1.5% -- just went down dramatically, which is why I’ve had to reexamine my investment strategy)
* Direct deposit to 401k (5% flat contributed by my employer &amp; currently 20% vested -- I don’t need to contribute to get the 5% from my employer): ~$1,100/month
* After this, I only have dollars left over from my wages, which I place in my savings.


**Current savings accounts, totalling $44,780:**

* CDs, with interest ranging from 1.05% to 2.9%: $31,000 (for possible down payment... in the next 5-10 years...)

* 401k: $8,000 (Lots of Redditors seem to talk about Vanguard Investment Funds through mutual funds, but my current 401k has Vanguard Target options, which I currently invest in.)
* Stocks: $1,780
* Emergency fund savings: $4,000 (I can also withdraw from my CDs if necessary.)

So the question is: How do I save wisely? Should I keep placing my money in CDs or should I try placing more in stocks or a mutual fund?

(I’ve been reading up on investments, such as the links posted in r/personalfinance, but would like a nudge in the right direction.)

**EDIT:** Another question -- my employer contributes 5% to my 401k without any contribution on my part. Should I decrease the amount I place into a 401k and go for an IRA instead? (GetMeowtaHere answered this, but feel free to contribute to his/her response.)

* 6 months. Is that 6 months of expenses or income? If expenses, is that current spending level or spending level in the event of an emergency? If I lost my job, for example, I would stop driving to work (car expenses), could stop going for meals/drinks etc.

* How liquid does it need to be? I've noticed some people have bond ladders set up where a bond matures every month so they will have a months expenses coming to them every month.

A delayed thanks - reading here made me take my finances more seriously, and I am already in a much better place. Thank you.

Onto the topic at hand: **student loans, employee/employer loyalty, and silly ideas from 24 year olds**:

This idea is one that has been kicking around in my head for a bit. It came out of a few thoughts:

* Employers are pissed that workers are becoming less loyal.
* The reasons that we were loyal often had to do with long-term benefits - namely, pensions
* It is hard to build loyalty around a 401(K)
* Employees don't feel that companies are loyal to them, and in turn, do not have the loyalty that Generation X/Boomers did.
* Student loans are a problem, both for individuals and on a macro level.

Then, it hit me - what if, rather than funding a 401(K), the employer had the opportunity to use that money to help with an employee's student loan debt. I admit that I have not fleshed out the logistics fully, but I feel that there is a way to do this in a fair way. 


Approaching this as someone with a bunch of student loans, having the ability to dump either pre-tax or defined contributions into my debt, rather than a 401(K), would help increase my loyalty. It might just be a personal thing, which is why I come to you. 


Idea's I have had on it (again, I know that this is not fleshed out, and may be totally stupid - but I have thought about this off and on for a few months now, and that usually means I need to write it down and have other people tear it to shreds):

* Perfect world: It is not unlike a 401(K), using either pre- or post- tax contributions, and matched. This is hard to implement.
* Defined contributions: This I see as easier to implement. Its basically just money from the employer to throw at student loans. Could be hard to enforce that the money is going to the right place.
* I believe that student loans are structured different enough that this can be implemented in a way that minimizes abuse. Between distributions and the fact that they are rarely able to be discharged, I don't think abuse would be a massive issue.

I am living paycheck to paycheck and I'm not able to pay my bills. I can't see any possible way to fix things except for slowing paying things off. I wanted to post here to see if anyone would think if anything that I cannot.

I make roughly $800 each check and I am paid bi weekly. Here are my monthly bills. 

$565 rent
$70 phone
$70 cable/Internet
$267 school 
$138 car insurance 
$70 electricity
$15 water
$90 Disney annual pass
$80 gas

As for my debt, I owe about $5000 in various credit cards. At this point I am not even paying the minimums on all of my cards.

Is this a good idea?",131,39,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ga0wy/my_parents_have_50000_for_their_entire_retirement/,"(These first two paragraphs are backstory - skip them if you feel like it) My dad is 57, and my mom is 48. Dad can't work work because of severe health problems (in a wheelchair, needs an oxygen tank) and some issues with depression and severe paranoia (the paranoia is why I'm posting this from a throwaway). Mom is also in bad shape (serious heart and blood pressure problems, chronic pain, etc), but still works part-time at a convenience store. They live in the Northeast, and their kids/grandkid live in the Southeast, about fifteen hours away.

They have around $50,000 left from a $100,000 workman's comp settlement he got 2-3 years ago. They have a total income of $1900/mo (1100 from his disability and 800 from Mom's job). Their mortgage is $900/mo, and after owning it for 20+ years they still owe about what the house is worth, due to refinancing the house several times for stupid reasons (such as buying a saxophone and a convertible). In addition to the usual expenses, they also have $1600/mo in health insurance, since neither of them has a job that gives it and Dad is apparently not eligible for Medicaid/Medicare/what-have-you for another year. 

So. Total income: $1900. Total expenses: $2500 + utilities/gas/groceries, so probably around $3000+. Cash on hand: $50,000. 

Their plan is to sell their house and move down south by me. I'm in a very cheap area, and there are a number of houses in reasonably good condition around here for around $30,000. They propose buying one of those with cash, which will eliminate their mortgage. Mom would get a job, probably something paying similarly to her current one, and Dad would soon be eligible for state health insurance benefits. Proposed ending situation: ~$1900/mo income, ~$1500/mo expenses, zero cash (assuming they'd need some of the surplus $20k to live on until they're moved, Mom has a job, Dad gets his state insurance, etc).

My brother-in-law thinks they're insane, but I'm inclined to think that this is sort of a good idea in their situation, since they'll at least have somewhere to live when they run out of cash if they own the home outright. Plus, having their money tied up in a house instead of sitting in the bank (well, in gold bars and stacks of 20s in my dad's underwear drawer, actually) can only be a good thing, since it'll prevent using it to buy stupid shit like new cars and expensive musical instruments. 

But I don't know. Is it smart for them to drop all of their available cash on this when they have so little to begin with at their age? Some input would be really helpful.

1363786268.0,96,self.personalfinance,1anta4,College savings for children that don't exist yet,135,39,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1anta4/college_savings_for_children_that_dont_exist_yet/,"I'm in the belated process of learning how to properly save and plan for the future, and have been setting up savings plans for all the medium and long term goals I can think of. In addition to emergency funds, future cars and homes, travel plans, and retirement funds, the thought of saving for my children's education occurred to me.

The thing is, I'm 29, single, and have no children as of yet. But I would hope to settle down and start a family sometime in the next five years.  After a few false starts, I found a [College Savings Calculator](http://members.cunamutual.com/calcs/calc.asp?nav_dest=calc:College&amp;site=01901629) that lets you put in negative numbers for the ages of your hypothetical children, so that's good.

My question is, **What is the best type of investment account to use for this purpose?** The obvious choice is the 529, but despite my planning on sending children to college eventually, I'm worried about what would happen if I put lots of money into one only to find myself unmarried or lacking children down the road. 529 money can _only_ be used for educational expenses, right?

A traditional IRA appears to allow disbursements for ""qualified higher education expenses of owner, children, and grandchildren,"" so that sounds like it might be the way to go. That way if I wind up with no one to send to school, I can just count it towards retirement.

Is a traditional IRA the best option for putting away money that might or might not be used for a child's education? Thanks!

**2013/03/20 10:51 EST - Answers so far:**

- A 529 account is probably a bad choice because the money would have to be used for education, and I might not need money for education. Also, 529s must be tied to a beneficiary, and I have no current beneficiary. However, you can open a 529 for whoever - yourself, even - and then transfer it over to a different 529 naming your child as the beneficiary when the child is born ([source](http://www.savingforcollege.com/grandparents/answer.php?grandparent_faq_id=5)).

- A traditional IRA might be a good choice, except that I'm already maxing a Roth, so no more IRA contributions for me.

- An ordinary investment account and/or taxable mutual funds might therefore be the way to go. 

**2013/03/20 14:43 EST:**

- Another option mentioned involves [Cash Value Life Insurance](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/college-finance/life-insurance-or-529-for-college-savings-1.aspx). I still don't fully get how it works, are you borrowing against it, or is it an account where you put money and can take money out? It sounds like the return on investment is relatively low but very safe, possibly even guaranteed. [**pmussoni**](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1anta4/college_savings_for_children_that_dont_exist_yet/c8z48jt) advocates this in this thread. I don't know. It sounds fancy. And potentially good. But also... immoral? It makes _sense_ that the government will offer me less financial aid if I've saved a lot of money for college. This loophole would seem to deprive more needy students of aid by making my child look poorer on paper than he really is.

- One suggestion that might be best right now is to not invest in my children's education. Yet. As of right now, I'm not maxing out my retirement accounts, and it won't be too late to start saving specifically for my kids' education when I actually start having kids.

Have been going back and forth with my small firm's Finance Director this morning and still can't believe what she's telling me.

She just got the ""Q1 401(k) package, and [my] deferral of 13.99% of my salary is throwing us out of compliance for ERISA purposes."" 

My base is $140k. I max out my 401(k). Never saw that as a problem, but now, as I was just told,

""Even though the 'max' for 2013 is $17,500; the Plan testing limits will cap you. The reason is that when Congress passed the laws, it didn’t want unlimited tax breaks for the Highly Compensated.

Even if you max out at $17,500 this year, it will put you at approx. 12.50% deferral which is well above the cap of 5.75% now.

The reason we have always passed is that the pool of 'non-highly' compensated is getting larger, thus dragging down the average.""

So, has anyone ever dealt with something like this? I am pushing back but the message I'm getting from my own Finance Director is ""Adjust it and get us back in compliance."" 

I just can't believe that it's somehow suddenly inappropriate for me to withhold up to the legal contribution limit.

BTW, there is no match at my firm, for what that's worth.

Edit: Update

So I went back to the Finance Director and asked her that, in addition to effectively restricting HCEs' contributions, we should also take some of the steps others have suggested (e.g. raise awareness of the program, offer a company match, or convert to a safe harbor plan).

Her response was that we're already a ""mandatory"" plan, so enrollment is automatic for new employees, and NHCEs' average deferral is 4%.

She says she's spoken with the CEO/owner, and we're not in a cash position to offer a match or switch to a safe harbor plan.

So, for now, it's essentially ""tough luck.""

I may go back and ask for a modest comp adjustment to offset the impact, but I guess my best bet is to open a taxable brokerage account and start funding that with the funds I was previously deferring into the 401(k).

1371822408.0,94,self.personalfinance,1gskny,(World) Protip when you're traveling abroad,120,26,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gskny/world_protip_when_youre_traveling_abroad/,"[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gscwd/dear_bank_of_americai_hope_you_die_in_a_fire/) has motivated me to write this list of simple tips will help you financially prepared when you're going abroad.

I've traveled to about 40 countries in six continents for academic, business, and personal reasons. Here's some tips that I think you'll find **very** useful. These tips are from the American perspective but are really for everyone:


----

**Get a Citibank or HSBC card**

* My buddies and I always joke that Citibank and HSBC are the unofficial embassies. Here's why: When you're abroad, you'll *rarely* see your bank's branch in your host city -- unless if you are a Citi or HSBC customer. Citibank and HSBC are in almost every developing and developed country in the world. HSBC even has a branch in **[Palestine!](http://www.pipa.gov.ps/view.asp?id=17)** If you'll be traveling frequently, get a Citi/HSBC card that charges zero foreign transaction fee.

**If your PIN is over 4 digits, go to a Citibank ATM.**

* Most of their ATMs accept over four digits. 

**Check branch locations of your bank's affiliated local bank (or Citi/HSBC)**

* If your bank has a contract with a local bank (e.g. China Construction Bank for Bank of America customers), check their branches before you leave the country. I've seen so many BofA people complaining after they withdrew money from Bank of China, etc. when the CCB was probably some blocks away.

**Have backup plans in case your cards get rejected.**

* If you swipe your debit or credit card at a flagged location, your bank may suspect fraud and suspend your card until you call them to verify that it's okay. I've seen that happening to a lot of people, and they usually came to me to borrow money. But this will become a problem if you don't have any friends in the area or need relatively large sums of money. Have backup plans.

**Or just get a Schwab card and use any ATM** (AngryConsultant &amp; hulk181)

* Use any ATM in the world, and Schwab will refund any ATM fees incurred. [hulk181's link to Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking Account](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account). There are some credit unions doing the same practice, so you might want to look into it.

**Notify your banks and credit card companies that you'll be traveling to what countries.** (lilfunky1)

&gt; That way they'll at least have a note on your file that will explain ""Yes, it's okay that there's suddenly charges from France on lilfunky1's Canadian credit card. She's supposed to be there between the 1st and the 15th"" (Haha. I wish!)

(Non-banking) **For cheap mobile service, unlock your phone and get a local SIM card** (NPPraxis)

&gt; In Europe, you can get data-only prepaid no-contract cell phone plans on a SIM card for very cheap. I got one month of unlimited data for $10 in Italy and 2 GB for $15 in the Netherlands.
&gt; Pop one of these in your unlocked cell phone (I use an iPhone) and you can use Google Voice (free) to make unlimited free phone calls and text messages anywhere in the US. Plus you have access to maps and Priceline and hostelworld and all of that. Perfect for travelling in Europe.

* You can unlock your phone by simply calling your carrier (e.g. T-Mobile) in most cases. Some carriers may be hesitant if you got your device very recently.

I have been paying rent (1600) for two years now. Ultimately I want to get a nice home in this area. Im 25, have a 660 credit score - working to improve it- and approximately 20k in savings and 401k. 

I would rather not touch this though. I was in the Marine Corps for 5 years and have access to VA loans - with 0 down I hear. 

If I went to school with my full time job I could get an additional 2k income.

If I bought a nice condo, or home, in the Glendale area do you think it would be a good idea to buy, and rent the property? 

Would I have trouble getting a second loan after this property is rolling with tenants, and loan is being paid on time? The second loan would be a condo/home for me to live in - because I despise rent... I feel like I die a little every time I have to pay money to temporarily live here. 

Or, I could go to Vegas, and put all my money on black. Let me know what you honestly think.

**Edit**: I would hire a property management company to handle everything.
 
**Edit 2**: I agree now that rent isn't as bad as I posted earlier; it is a service and is what I'm paying for. **Thanks everyone**. Also, does anyone think renting an apartment may be easier than a home? Due to just keeping up the property, and less to worry about.. I think.

I am an NCO in the US Air Force. I am looking to put together solid information that I can pass along to other enlisted members as they join the military. I believe that a solid financial situation can help alleviate a lot of the stress that these young men and women are subjected to upon entering the armed forces.

I recognize that there are some issues that are beyond my capability to address (such as Airmen arriving at their first base are almost required to purchase a vehicle to get anywhere) however I want to do my best to mentor them and set them on the right path.

I received no such help as I joined, and if it weren’t for me being a naturally sensible person with my own finances, I might find myself in quite a different situation today. Regardless of where I stand, I am a less than ideal teacher due to my inexperience in sharing information of this nature. That does not, however, diminish the importance of the subject.
____________________________________________

So my questions to you all: 

* How do I best approach these young men and women, and share with them the knowledge that will allow them to lead a stable and successful life (from a financial perspective)?

* What materials are the easiest to digest, yet impart the most crucial information? I’ll take videos, comics, or ANYTHING except power-point. Seriously, no death by PowerPoint.

* How can I use myself as a reference point to better construct a positive link between good (but maybe tough) choices and a stable future?

**Debts**

Student Loans: $63,451 (according to Mint this morning, interest rates vary between 2.1 and 8%, most are private loans - I went to an in-state school, worked part-time, and lived at home for undergrad and graduate school)

Credit Card Debt: $7,556 (current balance that I'm paying on, card has been cut up and tossed away, interest is 16.99%--I used this pretty heavily when I was unemployed for gas and groceries)


**Expenses**

Monthly rent: $430 (includes utilities, cannot go any lower without moving into the worst part of town)

Netflix: $9 (don't have cable so this is my 'entertainment' budget and I use it heavily)

Cell phone: $75 (stuck in a contract for at least another year but will be splitting a family plan w/ my partner as soon as it's up)

Bills (CC &amp; Loans): $925 (minimums only)

Total Expenses: $1439


Income: $1840/month (I work full time in a professional office setting, not in my field of study)


Which leaves $401 a month left over for essentials:  gas ($100/month on average just for getting to/from work, as the public transport in my city is crap and I don’t own a bike), food (~$200/month for two people, mostly fruits/veggies and lean protein) and $100 for incidentals (replacing worn out clothes, toiletries, other essentials). 

My partner makes quite a bit more than I do, but all our finances are separate as he's working on paying off his own debt (which is significantly less than mine) and he pays a larger share of the rent/utilities.

I have no emergency fund, no savings, and there’s no option for me to get a raise or more hours. I do have a 401k but since I've only been at my job a year, it's pretty tiny and my company only matches 4% (which is all I contribute anyway).

I’ve been looking for a new job for over a year now with no luck and I’m hesitant to try for a second job since most of my non-work time is taken up with cooking dinner/lunch for the next day, keeping the house clean, and actually spending time with my partner. 

Am I ever going to get out of this rut or am I just doomed to 12 years of never-ending interest and payments?

1341175468.0,91,self.personalfinance,vw4pe,I see a lot of people seeking advice on picking a credit card. I wanted to share a little write-up of my thought process.,102,11,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/vw4pe/i_see_a_lot_of_people_seeking_advice_on_picking_a/,"Before applying for my first credit card about two years ago, I spent several weeks browsing and comparing all the credit cards out there. There may be a different selection of credit cards offered today, but I hope that my thoughts on picking credit cards can help you choose your first card.

**Objective**

To maximize my rewards. I will never carry balance month-to-month.

**Where do I start?**

Check out some of the websites of the credit card companies you may already be familiar with and see what they have to offer. Remember those credit card ads you’ve seen on TV? Go see what they’re all about. You just want to get a feel for what’s out there to make an informed decision. You wouldn’t want to pick a credit card only to find out there was a much better one you could have gotten instead. To speed up your research efforts, check out websites such as CreditCards.com or nerdwallet.com. Both give you a comparison of many credit cards across different issuers. This frequently updated [forum post](http://www.fatwallet.com/forums/finance/711457/) also has a nice list of current offerings.

**What you’ll find**

Look at what the different credit cards offer and you’ll start to notice some trends. Some charge an annual fee (like some American Express cards) and others offer do not. I made sure to pick one with no fee. The length of your credit history matters. If in the future I find myself not using this credit card I’m about to apply for, I will want to hold onto this card and throw it in a drawer. If I were to cancel the card, I would immediately lose the history I have with the card, negatively affecting my credit score. Without a fee, I can safely put the card away, not use it, and not worry about paying just to keep it around.

Speaking of American Express, there are 4 major payment networks. Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. Just keep in mind that Visa and MasterCard are accepted in more locations than the other two. If you went with an American Express or Discover card, you may find that some retailers or restaurants do not accept your card.

Many cards offer bonuses for certain categories of purchases. For example, a card may give you more points or cash back for using your card on groceries. Some popular cards, including the Chase Freedom, have rotating bonus categories. Every 3 months, the card chooses 3 new categories that earn you bonus points.

**Narrowing it down**

When you start looking more closely at cards, you’ll notice some have credit requirements. Here’s how I would approach it with your first credit card when you may not know what sort of credit score you have. Pretend you have a good credit score and look at all credit cards. If you apply to one that requires an excellent credit score and you get denied, go down a level. If you get denied once or twice, you should be safe in applying for student credit cards. These are more slightly more lenient in their requirements.

I definitely preferred Visa and MasterCard to American Express and Discover. I only wanted to deal with one credit card that I could use almost anywhere while I was still learning.

**The Basic Strategy**

Find a couple of cards that seem like potential fits. Learn all about them, read the fine print of the card offerings, and check out what others have to say about it on the internet.

**An Example of My Thought Process**

Cash back cards were high up on my list. The idea of getting money for spending money I was going to spend one way or another was appealing. It seemed like the most you could get was a flat 2% cash back on every purchase. That’s pretty cool in my opinion. That’s like a getting a 2% off coupon on every purchase you make. Unfortunately, the king of all cash back cards, the Schwab 2% cash back card, was replaced recently to many people’s dismay.

I used the 2% cash back as my bench mark. If I could earn more money back with points, then I would go with a points credit card.

I found a couple of credit cards that seemed like they might give me the most rewards. I am not a big fan of the rotating categories. I don’t like the unpredictability of the points, and I think it incentivises people to make unnecessary purchases.

The Citi Forward piqued my interest. It offered bonus points on restaurants, bookstores, music stores, video rental stores and movie theaters. This fit my college lifestyle well because I mainly spent money on food and books (also it turns out all Amazon purchases are categorized as bookstore purchases!).

I did some digging around on one of my favorite credit card forums FatWallet’s Finance section. I looked up what sort of redemption rates Citi offers with its points. They didn’t offer a very good redemption rate for cash, but pretty good rates for gift cards. They offered popular $100 gift for 10,000 points. With the Citi Forward card, I receive 5 points on the aforementioned bonus categories and 1 point on every other purchase.

So I thought about a typical semester and made a conservative estimate of my expenses (3 months long).

* $300 in textbooks
* $300 in restaurants
* $400 in flights
* $200 miscellaneous

With the Citi Forward card, I accumulated 5 points for buying textbooks and restaurants. And 1 point for every dollar in flights and miscellaneous. This amounts to 3,600 points. If I used the rate of $100 gift card for 10,000 points (or $1 for every 100 points), I could theoretically cash my 3,600 points in for a $36 dollar gift card. So I spent $1,200 and received a reward of $36. That is a 3% reward rate. That is a whole percent better than the cash back! If my spending leaned even more towards just restaurants (fast food included) and textbooks (Amazon included), that rate would be even better.

**Don’t Worry**

Lastly, don’t worry too much about making your first credit card your perfect credit card. Find something that fits well and stick with it for a while as you learn the reins. Chances are your finances may change (especially when you make the transition from school to the “real world”) and you may find a different credit card that is better for your spending habits.

It’s actually advantageous for your to have a couple of credit cards open because your credit score takes into account the credit limit of all your credit cards and adds them together. At the same time, you don’t want to open so many credit cards you can’t keep track of them all.

Don’t worry if you’re denied from a credit card when applying for your first. You probably don’t have much of a credit history for credit card companies to work with. Also, be aware that each time you apply for a credit card, the company does a hard pull on your credit. It has a slight negative effect on your credit score temporarily, but when you’re trying to get your first credit card the effect is negligible. In summary, don’t worry about applying to a few credit cards if you get denied the first couple times. Just don’t apply for like 10 cards. Take it one a time.

Focus on building great credit history early and the benefits you receive from having a good credit score will outweigh a percentage point here or there.

I've noticed more and more people here in this forum blindly suggesting to people that they should max out a Roth account instead of contributing to a traditional retirement account. It seems that a lot of those that are suggesting Roth accounts don't understand the tax implications, and are assuming that a Roth IRA would be better.

In most cases, it isn't. This has a lot to do with the difference between marginal tax rate and the average tax rate. Every dollar put into your Roth IRA is taxed at your marginal tax rate (The highest tax bracket your salary puts you into). Whereas contributions to a traditional retirement account take dollars away from your marginal tax rate which reduces your average tax rate, and when you withdraw them, they are taxed at your average rate.

#Since your marginal rate is always higher than your average rate, in most cases a 401k contribution is the smarter choice.

###Let's do an example:

A single person is living on their own and making $50k salary. This person is trying to decide if he should contribute to a Roth IRA or contribute to his 401k. Fortunately this guy's 401k is managed by Vanguard, and has access to every fund.

He's considering saving 10% of his income yearly, or $5k. How do his accounts look after 40 years?

With the traditional 401k option, all $5000 is taken off of the top of his income, meaning that for tax purposes the IRS thinks that he made $5000 less that year. For 2012 that would mean his total taxes are $4855. **He has $40,145 available to him for the year** ($50k - $4855 tax - $5000 in 401k).

After 40 years of investments making 5% interest, his 401k account has $620,235. He wants this money to last him the next 30 years, so he calculates that he can withdraw $31,140 yearly, and with a 3% interest rate on his account, his account will hit $0 right at the 30 year mark.

#Now, because the money is in his 401k account, and it's not a Roth type of retirement account, the money is taxed. $31,140 of income from a 401k account would be taxed $2775, **leaving him with $28,365 of yearly income.**

**Now let's make Roth IRA contributions instead.**

We need to make things fair, so remember that above we had $40,145 available yearly. So, without the additional deduction from 401k contributions $50k of salary will be taxed $6095. This leaves us with $3760 to invest in the Roth IRA. You have the exact same income available to you ($40,145), but you can only contribute $3,760 per year.

#After 40 years of investments, with the exact same 5% interest rate, you will have $466,417 available in your retirement account. Again, we would like this money to last us the next 30 years invested at 3%, so with some simple calculations we find that we can withdraw $23,417 yearly. Obviously, because this is a Roth account, there are no taxes that need to be paid, **so your actual take home income is $23,417.**

#The difference between these 2 is fairly staggering. In one scenario, you get $28,365 yearly, which is $2363 a month. In the other you get $23,417 yearly, which is $1951 a month. **That's a difference of 20%! You'll have 20% more money available to you, every single year of your retirement, just by picking the correct retirement account to contribute into!**

##Taxes:

Another common topic that is brought up is the thought that taxes will rise in the future, thus it is imperative that you pay your taxes now by contributing to a Roth type account. This will shield you from advancing taxes in the future.

Fear of increased taxes is perfectly understandable, but consider how low your income is likely to be during retirement. In all of the examples above the working/contributing income is in the second or third brackets, and the retirement income is almost wholly in the very lowest tax bracket. It is incredibly unlikely that any political party would increase taxes on the Americans making the absolute lowest income.

Another possibility is that retirement could be taxed entirely differently. With a totally separate set of tax brackets for people that are withdrawing money from a retirement account instead of from paychecks, similar to how capital gains are taxed separately from normal income. In this case it is equally likely that both Roth and Traditional retirees will be screwed.

**The bottom line is that speculation on tax increases is exactly that. Speculation. You don't speculate with your retirement investments, why should you speculate with your tax rates?**

##Fees and penalties:

A common selling point of Roth plans instead of 401k plans is that you can withdraw every dollar that you contributed without any penalties.

This is an excellent benefit to Roth plans, as you can treat them almost like a high interest savings account. I wholeheartedly agree with this, and I believe they should be used in exactly that way.

###Here's an example:

You're making a $50k salary, and, like above, you're contributing to either a 401k or Roth IRA monthly ($5k and $3760 respectively). 3 years into your career your roof collapses, your car's engine seizes, and you trip and break your ankle. All on the same day.

You're going to be out of work for a while, and you need more money than your emergency savings contains. So we need to pull money from the retirement account.

Mr. 401k has $16,186 in his retirement account, and he needs $5000 right now in order to pay his bills. Now you must pay a 10% penalty, plus your full marginal tax rate on the money. Since we're out of work for 6 months we're only making $25k this year, so we're currently in the 15% marginal tax bracket. So we need to withdraw roughly $5k / 90% / 85% or $6535 in order to actually get $5000 in spending money. Now our retirement account is down to $9650.

Mr. Roth IRA has $12,172 in his account. And again, needs to withdraw $5k for this emergency. Thankfully he's contributed more than $5k to his account, so there are no taxes or fees assessed. He pulls $5k out and his retirement account dips to $7172.

**Both people pulled out $5000 in spending money from their accounts, the 401k owner has $9650 still in his account, and the IRA owner has $7172 in his account.**

This shouldn't be terribly surprising, we learned earlier that dollar for dollar the 401k owner will have a larger account balance at every check point along the way to retirement, now what we need to find out is if the extra $2400 he has in his account actually makes his taxable account worth more than Mr. IRA.

Let's work for another 37 years (40 years total) and see how the two compare.

Mr. 401k has $580,486 available at the end of year 40. Nearly $40k less than the guy that didn't have to withdraw $5k in year 3. He gets to retire on $29,140 per year, and is hit with $2475 in taxes, leading to a retirement income of $26,665 yearly or $2222 monthly.

Mr. IRA has $436,010 available at the end of year 40. This is $30k less than the first example where we never withdrew $5k in year 3. 30 years of retirement money would equate to $21,890 yearly, or $1824 monthly.

Yet again, **even with having taken a $5k hit with taxes and penalties, the 401k account still comes out ahead. And, again, we have a difference of nearly 20% in favor of the 401k over the IRA contributor.**

##You can stop reading here if you don't want to math.

All of the calculations in the above examples were calculated in the following ways.

Taxes are based on Standard + Personal deductions for a single person with no children. No additional deductions were applied. Married filing jointly would follow the same patterns exactly with all monetary values doubled for the couple (aka it would be the same math for individuals) for the salaries we are talking about. Tax responsibilities wouldn't shift unless the individual is making over $85k yearly, or the couple is making over $142k yearly. If you are making above that, it should be blatantly obvious to you that you should be contributing to a traditional type of account instead of a Roth account due to the huge disparity between your Marginal and Actual tax rates.

Interest was calculated with monthly contributions and interest compounded monthly (ie, a $100 contribution in January, with no additional contributions, that has a 5% APY was compounded monthly at 0.4074%, leading to an account balance of $105 in January the following year).

Retirement withdrawals were compounded monthly at a rate of 0.2466% (3% APY) with regular monthly withdrawals of the yearly rate/12. There were not calculated as having single large withdrawals followed by a full year of interest. (Basically the same calculations as above, but with negative monthly contributions and a lower interest rate). The withdrawal rate was adjusted by the dollar until the account had less than $100 at the end of year 30, but was still positive.

I'll provide any of these calculations that you may question to anyone interested. Just let me know.

##You can start reading again here

I am open for discussion on any of the assumptions I've made during this incredibly long post. Some of them may seem unintuitive, but I tried the best that I could. The biggest point of contention is probably going to be the low retirement income. After all, who could retire on less than $30k a year. If that's your thinking than you should already know that an IRA alone won't hold you over, and due to all of the above math and examples, you should see that ever dollar you contribute to an IRA instead of a 401k is less efficient than just contributing to a 401k.

Now, I've finished school and I'm making a very measly income, all things considered. I'm getting closer and closer to 30, and it's still weighing on me - but it's also troublesome to my longtime girlfriend. She doesn't make a big issue of it, but I know she's concerned. So am I.

So, short of looking for a better job (much easier said than done), what's my best step forward? For a while I was considering bankruptcy to clear out all of my unsecured [bad] debt which I've long since had charged off. But now it seems that it may be more beneficial to show good faith and try to pay off my creditors, no matter how small the payments (though some are only willing to accept settlements, I've found).

I've started paying on my current outstanding loans, and given my current budget, it's a beating. There's no way I could afford a reasonable monthly payment to all of my creditors without going hungry.

Is bankruptcy really all that bad? Would it behoove me more to pay off my debts, slowly but surely? I'm really not sure which way to go.

Thanks in advance

Okay so here is my situation:

**All the writing in italics is just background info which you can probably skip, I've just generalized things and made timelines/events very brief to give you an overall idea**

*Straight out of school, I went to TAFE where I studied a Diploma in IT (Networking). Things were not going so well for me, and my dad offered me a full time job at his construction company. I ended up deciding to leave TAFE and abandon my diploma, because I was not doing well and did not like it that much. From there I was made into a Health and Safety Officer, where I done a few courses (WHSO course, plus a cert 4 in Health and Safety).*

*It was my first job, but I was earning a LOT of money (~$800 a week), so being young and having loads of cash, I decided to take out a loan for $20k and bought a car.*

*Later on that year I met a girl and we started dating. Fast forward 1.5 years and I lose my job due to a conflict with a manager (I decided to leave because working for family was creating tension and not working to well and one of the mangers there was making my life very hard). By this point I had $3000 worth of credit card debt due to stupid decisions and generally being an idiot with money.*

*I then moved to another small construction company as a laborer (really not my thing). Fast forward another year and due to stupidity / unforeseen circumstances / accidents / bills, I am at $6500 credit card debt. A year later, present time, I've moved in with my sister.*

**My debt situation:**

* Car Loan: $15,600 left - Repayments: $120 a Week - 13.90% P.A, Variable Rate
* Credit Card: $6500 - Repayments: $130 a Month - 19.74% P.A
* TV Finance: $1000 to go - Repayments: $80 a Month
* Ipad bill: $700 to cancel and pay out, or $120 a month for 7 months

**My other expenses are:**

* Rent: $80 a Week
* Fuel: $80 a Week
* Food: $80 a Week
* Phone: $86 a Month
* Internet/Home phone: $65 a Month
* Loan Insurance: $30 a Month
* Entertainment / Misc spending: $90 a Month
* Car Services: $200 a Quarter 
* Rego: $345 every 6 Months
* Car Insurance: Either $110 a Month OR $1200 a year (Due next month)

**Where I want to be**

My main goal is, sometime this year I would like to start a course for a Cert 4 in Human Resources. I can start the course whenever I want, there are 10 units, each unit costs $480 and takes roughly a month to complete, however I can do it at my own pace and pay as I go, per unit.

I also really want to move out of my sisters house and move in with my girlfriend, however that would mean I have to pay $300 rent a week, plus all her bills which include:

* Cigarettes (Yuck I know): $50 a Week
* Extra Food: Total combined $100 a Week
* Her Phone: $50 a Month
* Electricity: $320 a Quarter
* Gas: $150 a Quarter

**My Income:**

I currently earn ~$800 a week. Sometimes its as low as $740, other times its as high as $1200, but MOST weeks its around $800. 

I do some work for friends family including mowing lawns, cleaning fish tanks, photography etc. which makes me around $100 - $150 a month. 

**My Plan Which May Be Terrible**

I currently have $4000 in the bank in savings. My plan is:

* Stay at my sisters another 3 months, which will save me hopefully $2000 by the third month
* Pay off Ipads in Full this week for $700
* Pay off TV in Full this week for $1000
* Re-finance my loan this week up to $24900, variable rate, 7 year period (Up from 3.5 years), repayments: $124 a Week
* Use money from loan to pay off and cancel credit card, leaving me $2000
* Use $2000 plus remaining savings ($2300) to pay for course
* Ask my parents / my girlfriends parents if they will help us pay for a bond on a new cheaper unit (Currently my girlfriend pays $340 a week, I want to find somewhere cheaper for $300 a week) and use the savings between now and 3 months time living at my sisters house, to pay for any other bills (possibly pay my insurance yearly, so I don't have to worry about paying it monthly)

So what do you guys think? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm actually heading off to bed now because I have work tomorrow, but I will try answer any and all questions straight away tomorrow morning.

About 8 months ago I got serious with money. I'm in the technology field and paid decently at 27 years old... but I had little to show for it. We moved to a different state and we're living comfortable, with a large entertainment/eat out budget and living life in a nice apartment, carrying a car loan, student loans, and credit debt. We made the decision after our first child to be a single income household... so any change in my employment would probably put us two missed paychecks away from homelessness without outside help. 


I started lurking in PersonalFinance and started reading the archive of posts as well as the linked blogs that you guys follow- MrMoneyMustache, 20somethingfinance, EarlyRetirementExtreme, etc. 


About 6 months ago I posted a question regarding a house purchase and as a collective group you guys told me that my finances were too precarious to be responsible about a home purchase. 


Since that post, we did find and buy a house in a fantastic area- 225K plus probably 15K spent on furnishings and other things to make it ours...


BUT, at the same time I paid off all credit card debt, paid off all of the student loans, paid off the car loan and added 10K to the Vanguard account.


Another 5K and we'll be up to 4 months of emergency fund- that's my focus at the moment. 6 months with cutting extraneous stuff ends up being about 20K which seems a bit wasteful to be in a low-interest account, but that's the price for peace of mind and liquid access

My SO saves ~1k per month
I save ~2.5k per month (currently all going towards loans. Will be done end of 2013)

How should I invest when my loans are taken care of (and how should my SO be investing now) if we want to retire early? I know the typical plan is 401k to company match, Roth IRA then back to 401k. This doesn't work too great if we want to retire early though because of early withdraw penalties.

I've heard that you can withdraw from a 401k early as long as you do it for several years in a row. Is this the best way to invest? Should we be passing over our Roth IRA and just throw all our money into a 401k? Would it be worth investing in a Roth IRA anyway since we can pull at least some of it out (for future expenses like a house/wedding)?

Any tips would be appreciated.

Currently 23. I'm making 75k, she's making 40k. In 5-10 years, i'll be making around 120k. She'll be making around 70k. We'd like to retire as early as possible (I think most would).

Additionally, I have about $32,000 in cash which I put in various accounts (Ally checking, Ally money market, bank of america checking, bank of america saving).

My question to you is, where should I put the money that will eventually grow to be $100,000 (20% downpayment)? Should I just keep it in Ally money market since it earns 0.9% interest? What did you do when you were saving for a house? What would you do differently?

(http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/12xe10/sanity_check_building_fund_paying_down_debt/)

I just finished paying off the outstanding balance on the credit card, just before the promotional rate was about to end.  As well, I've managed to get the Emergency Fund up to $2500, as well as a month's expenses in the chequing account.

Obviously I'm in a much more stable place now than I was a few months ago...

Several things have worked in my favour for this:

 * My wife actively helped.  In the past, my wife has enjoyed browsing thrift stores and would make lots of impulse purchases for things we didn't need.  She's worked hard at not doing that.
 * Budget:  I've been using Mint to track expenses and bills, and make sure I knew where the money was going.  With that, I've been able to try to more effectively manage the budget.
 * Better meal planning.  We made better use of our food and our leftovers and drastically cut down food waste.
 * Drastically cut back on eating out.
 * Overtime:  I've been able to accumulate some overtime, which went right into either EF or CC.
 * Contract renegotiation at work:  my union at work finally renegotiated our contract, and I received about $2500 back pay, as well as a cash settlement for a retirement benefit that was removed.  These completed the payment of the CC debt.

**Target 2**

 * Van: $12,000 @ 3% (2.5 years to go), payment $400 / month
 * House: $383,000 @ 3.69%, payment $1500 / month

I'd like to say that would be paying off the car.  I really would.  Because once the van is paid off, we can survive on just my income. 

But I think I should listen to the advice I was given, and work on increasing the EF now so that I have some more breathing room in case life throws another curveball. 

So, I'm going to work on continuing to grow the fund.  Its possible in Sept I may need to get a second car, and I want to have at least $5000 available in the fund by then so I can get a decent used car without needing financing.  

My wife has been able to resume working part tie, and is currently making around $800 - $1000 per month, and that money is being used to do the renovations / upgrades to the house that she wants.  The big thing is that we've realized that we need to make sure we've got the money up front rather than using credit....

The biggest question mark in our income right now is that we are hosting international students.  We receive a stipend for that, and we provide room and board for them.  The problem is that although the school board seems desperate for them every year, there isn't any guarantee that they will need any.

I thought well I guess that's not too terrible so I asked well you're at least paying the minimum right? (to me that's better than nothing at all) She says no, I was expecting some kind of joke about how she is paying more than that. I was wrong. She says she hasn't payed any of it. I freak out a bit because I've always been taught that you should always pay what you can even if it isn't the monthly payments. I've never been in debt more than my $17k car loan so I'm far from experienced. Her lawyer cousin said you will never pay it off just leave it and don't pay. Needless to say I was freaking out about this whole thing. I don't have a clue where I would even start looking for information on this, so I did what any redditor would do and came to ask my fellow redditors for help.  
More info on it.  
She has gotten letters from collection agencies.  
She's not sure how much it is exactly but said it can't be more than $20k.  
It's been about 5-6ish years.

Hopefully I can at least get some advice on where to start looking. Thanks in advance.

He's currently out of a job because he got fired, and apparently has not paid any bills at all for several months.  He lives with our parents, but has his own car (paid off but a piece of shit), his phone bill (which he stopped paying, and when they shut it off he just stopped using it) as well as a few credit cards and loans which he owes on.

Just a few minutes ago, a man came serving him an order to appear in court, Vantage Credit is bringing him to court over a $4,xxx loan which has gone unpaid.  It was one of those they send a $5,000 check in the mail, and if you deposit it you basically have the loan from them.  Interest is 11.9%, and like I said he has like $4,XXX outstanding.  

He has no money, no savings, no income, only his federal refund to his name.  He can't even go on unemployment because he was fired for workplace negligence.  My parents have maxed out everything they have (credit cards, home equity, etc etc) with other shit, and I'm only friggin 19 and trying to keep my head above water.  So we have absolutely nothing for a lawyer or anything.

So my question is, there's all these ""debt consolidation/ elimination"" whatever places you hear about, are any of them truly legitimate?  Are any of them cost-free?  Is there any way to actually settle all of his debt and for him to just pay a low monthly payment?  I'm talking like less than $50 a month.

Today I get a direct deposit from the treasury in the amount of $1,630.00

According to the IRS website, I may be receiving a letter that could explain the discrepancy but in the meantime....has this happened to anyone else?

I also see on the IRS website that it could be due to being behind on child payments, past obligations, compensation debts...I have none of that.  

My financial, tax and life situation is about as vanilla as they come.  Married filed jointly, 0 withholdings, 1 kid, no previous marriage, no other kids, 5th year of working since graduating from college.  I file my taxes every year on time, 1 house, no business ownership or 2nd house.  No debt to the government.  

I don't understand it.

EDIT - I just called the IRS and got an automated response that told me (paraphrasing here) ""that the Financial Management Service that handles the refund may have reduced the refund to pay any offsets, child support, debts, etc.  Please do not ask the IRS about the details because they are not told what the details are and cannot answer the question.  The letter you will get in the mail will explain any debts and to contact the financial management service that sends the letter.""

So basically I still have no idea why my refund would have been deducted and the letter may explain it.  

*EDIT 2 - Well, I feel a little foolish.  I completely forgot about my wife's issues with Social Security.  Turns out there was an over-payment many years ago due to her father (who is deaf) not reporting income.  SSI turned their target on my wife since she was still listed as a dependent under her father (even though her parents were divorced and they haven't been in contact for years) and said she owed. (its a really long story).   So she has been making his payments for a good while now.*

*I guess Social Security got tired of waiting and took the remainder of the balance out of ~~my~~ our tax refund, which is odd because she had a payment plan setup and was making payments every month.* 

*So that clears that up.  Obviously I'm not happy about it but I've been in the Social Security office more times than I care to, trying to fight this battle.

The first few years I worked I just put everything I had towards paying off all my student loan + credit card debt until I was debt free. Then I started stashing it all away in my savings accounts. 

I'm terrified of putting money in the stock market while it's at an all-time high. There's no way it doesn't go down sometime within the next two years, so if I buy now instead of when it goes down, I'm just losing money.  That has been my reasoning for the last year or so (and the stock market has just climbed and climbed). 

I almost invested in real estate, but I have no idea what I'm doing with  that and I pulled out at the last second for fear of losing all my money.  

I don't want to use a financial adviser because they will just take a cut of my money and throw it in the stock market. Fuck, I could do that without giving a cut to some middleman. 

Should I just wait until the stock market plummets and then put it all in a mutual fund?

I'm 30 years old. No debt. No kids.  I rent in a big expensive city ($3k/month). But I do support my girlfriend (younger beautiful model, totally worth it, don't judge :P ). 

Here's the rub: I am probably going to lose my job within the next 6 months and will have to take a job paying about 80k/year (quite a bit less than I've been making for the past few years).

1. Get my emergency fund up to $10,000.
1. Max out my Roth IRA at $5500 for the year.
1. Pay more towards my car.  (Payment is $240 a month, I started putting $400 towards it every month)

The reasons were many;  Me and my wife are trying to save up for a house, I feel more comfortable at the 10K level for the emergency fund, I want to get the car paid off ASAP so we can start saving to replace my wife's car.

But these first two months of 2013 have been a struggle.  I've seen my normal savings and checking accounts steadily going down in balance, while my credit card continues to go up.  It's nothing catastrophic, but I've come to the realization that I probably need to cut back on one of the above goals in order to maintain some sanity.  (I'm going back to normal car payments for a while)  By trying to be ""perfect"" I nearly got to the point of stopping everything to get back on the right side.

My advice to anyone out there trying to get your finances straightened out:  Do your best, but don't overdo it to the point where it's not sustainable.

Mutually, we took out a small payday advancement loan of 600 dollars over 8 payments which totalled out to be like 831 over the full length. She has the credit cards and her car under her credit, I have my car and some student loans, no credit cards. My student loans are deferred because I'm still in school, although the unsubsidized ones are gaining interest while I'm still in school. 

Right now, my car is our number one highest payment monthly of 356.60, but a planned refinance is scheduled for July of next year after one year of on-time payments through my local credit union. 

I've read several articles on financial debt-free solution websites that it's best to start with the lowest total amount that we have on credit and pay that off first, then begin ""snowballing"" it by working on the next highest and so on and so forth. Right now, my wife's credit cards are sitting maxed out at 500, 750, and 800 dollars, the five hundred dollar card is a basic capital one credit line, the 750 and 800 are both through retail stores. We owe roughly 350 left on the payday advance loan. 

My plan is to pay off the 350 dollar payday loan with 22.5% interest rate, then the visa at 17%. The retail store cards, both of which I had no idea about, are ""maxed"" from what my wife says, but I never see the statements because they go to her parents house still. 

I'm a full time student making roughly 1300 dollars a month, and she's full time making about the same. Our monthly expenses are:

365.60 - my car
220.00 - her car
130.00 - joint car insurance
~200 dollars a month in gas/car servicing.
50 dollars a month to her parents for paying for a set of tires for us.

It's worth noting that I was making about 2400 dollars a month until school and work began conflicting with each other.

So...now that the long story wasn't so short, can you give me any advice about how to take control of my wife's out of control spending and how to eliminate these debts from our life?

I've been reading personal finance for a while now and decided to register this (throw away) account to see if you guys had any advice for me.

Long story short: I am 24, live in the US (north carolina specifically), am self employed and have my own LLC for my business (but it is currently treated as a disregarded entity for tax purposes).  Starting this past June, my business took off.  As of September, I have averaged $750/day and I expect to maintain or increase that number by the end of the year.  Currently I live in an apartment and do not own a home.  So, we're looking at $20,000+ per month.

Since I've never had this kind of money before, I want to know if there is anything I should be doing to avoid paying more tax than I need to.  I plan on investing a good chunk of it back in my business, but what would be smart for me to do with the extras?  I have no problems saving money and don't go on crazy spending sprees ever, i.e., I plan on continuing to live like I have nothing, since that's what I'm used to).

Is it a still a good environment to invest in a home/land? What are some good, safe savings options (IRAs, etc.)?  Are there any useful tax credit opportunities out there for someone who will have ~100k saved up over the next 6 months or so?  Should I restructure my LLC to be more like an S-corporation?

Workers Comp dilemma.",105,19,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ownpb/185000_or_400_a_week_workers_comp_dilemma/,"Hi all. After 20 years with UPS humping packages over ice and snow in NY I destroyed my back. The doctors, lawyers and worker's comp board agreed that I can no longer do that type of work. Woo! I am currently receiving $400 per week or $20,000 per year from comp. They just offered to buy me out for $185,000.

That is definitely a boatload of money but simple math says at $20,000 per year and me being 44 years young, assuming that I will live 30 more years, they will have paid me $600,000. Sounds like a no brainer to keep the $400 per week but not so fast. Here's my dilemma. I can use the $185,000 to pay off my mortgage which is $175,000 saving me about $120,000 in interest over 26 years. That adds up to almost $300,000 which is still only half of what I will get ""if"" I live 30 years. If I choke on a beer pretzel and depart tomorrow my wife gets nothing from this settlement. 

Also, anything can happen to worker's comp. NY recently changed it so that anyone on comp now only gets it for 10 years and that's it! Fortunately for me I am grandfathered in so I get it for life. I still don't trust that it is a 100% guarantee that I'll always get those checks. If NY keeps heading in the direction that it is there may not be enough money to fund worker's comp...who knows?

I am not a gambling man so I like the ""sure thing"" with the 185k but is it ridiculous to give up a possible $400 a week forever??

And the business DID grow, off of my money.  Although we had a structured repayment plan it was absolute misery to get any of my money back.  The payments were due to end in 2010, but here it is 2013 and I get to enjoy watching someone be as flashy as they can possibly be, all while telling me they are broke and the business is failing and they can't pay me.  The amount owed is down to a trivial amount now that hiring a lawyer would cost more than recouping the remaining balance.  I am now left with either having to sue someone that was a friend (my travel costs would eat up most of any judgement alone), hound them until the day I die and give myself a stroke in the process, or making peace with the fact that someone grew their business into a multi-million dollar revenue machine off the back of my startup money and then told me to screw off.  

So the lesson is, never lend anyone a single cent that you aren't prepared to never see again.  I can live my life just fine without the remaining money, but I shouldn't have to.  The balance of that money would pay many months of living expenses, pay for my honeymoon, or any number of other bills that, while not a hardship, I shouldn't have to justify to anyone how I want to use my own money. 

I made a foolish decision to do business with someone who only is greedy and cares about transactions and not relationships, and I was lucky to get most of my money back.  I'll probably drop dead before seeing the rest of it.  It eats me up constantly.  I'm ALWAYS angry about it.  I'm forced into the unenviable position of either ignoring this person, or practically having to beg to get any amount.  It's embarassing frankly.  I am embarrassed to have to ask for my own money.  

Keep your money.  Don't risk it on other people.  It's a gamble and more often than not you will get burned.  Let me be your lesson of the day.  I consider the rest of the loan a total loss, unrecoverable.  If I ever see another dime of it it will be purely luck because the contract isn't worth wiping your ass with.

However, I was just researching the IRS definition of contractor vs employee work, and according to their standards it seems to fit the definition of employee. Does my contract agreeing that I'm an independent contractor invalidate that? 

Basically every aspect of my work fits the ""employee/employer"" definition. My job is phone-based working from home. 

-They set the pay rate and schedule
-I work at regular hours (set by company)
-They give me certain standards and requirements for how to conduct the calls
-Calls are frequently monitored and reviewed
-Performance is evaluated 
-Must file reports
-Advance notice and permission is required for absences 
-Certain number of 'days off' allowed in a year

If there are poor performance reviews or calls not meeting the company guidelines, they reduce schedules as a penalty/threat.

They also have a point-system where certain offenses (late for calls, no-show, requesting vacation days less than 1 week in advance) add points and a certain number of points leads to termination. 

As far as I can tell pretty much every standard determines that I'm an employee of the company, not a contractor. But they are hiring people as contractors, probably to avoid paying taxes. 

I did not receive a W2 or 1099. In previous years they gave a 1099-MISC but last year they changed the contract so we're contracted with their overseas parent company, rather than the American branch I initially was contracted with.  After changing, they've only sent a letter with a reported income amount, no legal forms at all. 

At first I was under the impression I had to file as a self-employed independent contractor, but from what I can tell I'm an employee. But I don't have any of the paperwork normally given to an employee. 

Main questions are, am I right that I legally qualify as an employee, not a contractor? Does my initial contract with the company signing as an ""independent contractor"" invalidate that, or is that contract invalidated by the company's treatment of contractors as employees? And how can I file my taxes without any forms if I'm an employee?

So my parents are in their mid 40s. They have no education further than a high school diploma. They've run a low paying in home daycare for the last 20 years. No savings at all. They don't even own the house they live in. My dad never moved out of his parents' home and now they're caring for my vegetative grandmother, using her pension checks to pay for the mortgage. I'm pretty sure once my grandmother dies (which won't be much longer) there will be some taxes to pay to transfer the house into my dad's name just to stay in the house that they are living in.

They are barely hanging on as it is. They live check to check, and get by by claiming me as a dependent on taxes, even though I haven't lived with them for two years. They are terrible with money. They put their paychecks on one of those WalMart prepaid cards which has a fee of $3 to load money on it because they don't trust themselves to balance their budget and not overdraft. They've always had to borrow money from me, but lately it's gotten worse. Their only car broke down for good recently (they need a car for their job), and they had to borrow $2200 from me to buy a used car, money that I'm not holding my breath on them being able to repay.

I'm fortunate enough to have a high-paying part time job and a live-in boyfriend who is also a working student, but this whole situation stresses me out almost daily. I can't afford health insurance, not even the student kind if they need my money, and I know one medical accident would put me in ruin. They could just get a better paying job, but my dad has scoliosis (barely not severe enough to claim disability benefits), and can't do any work that requires lifting or sitting for long amounts of time. Plus he's an asshole with huge untreated emotional issues, so there's no reasoning with him or getting him to change his lifestyle, financial or otherwise. The man doesn't even know the difference between a debit card and a credit card, and when I try to explain it to him, he gets all flustered and upset. 

My mom's looked into getting food stamps and other services, but said they don't qualify because they're self-employed. 

So basically, in the near future, it's likely that I'm going to have to support my parents, whether that's by providing them housing or something else. If nothing else, I will definitely be providing for them when they get too old to run a daycare. Is there anything that I can do to make this more comfortable for everyone? As much as I would love to just cut them off and tell them to deal with it themselves, I don't think I could live with myself. We live in California if that helps.

So we are considering buying something way below what we could afford. The goal would be to use this as a stepping stone.  Only stay in it for 5-8 years, and then move into a much more expensive permanent home that we will raise the family in.

I'm talking about buying a house that we could put 20% down on and pay off completely in under 10 years, without straining ourselves financially.  Or alternatively get a 30 year mortgage and have a reduction of about 40% less than what we currently pay in rent.

Is this a good idea? Is buying houses that are near the absolute bottom of the price range in the market a risky move? Is there a chance the house could significantly drop in value and I'm stuck with something I don't like very much for longer than I planned on?  Oh and I'm talking about an old single or a twin.

1341943353.0,82,self.personalfinance,wc78e,My student loans feel more like a psychological strain than a financial one. Does anyone else feel this way?,99,17,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/wc78e/my_student_loans_feel_more_like_a_psychological/,"I've searched and read through a lot of the student loan threads across multiple subs and wanted to point out something I think has been missing from the discussion, at least in my view: the psychological and emotional impact of student loan debt.

**Some background about me:** I graduated with a worthless degree from a state college. My mom had saved enough to pay for the first year of university, so that left me with the remaining three. I lived pretty fiscally responsible, I didn't really go to bars, I made all my own food, I took the bus. The usual.

I had a 25 hour-a-week job for the last two years of school, and I ended up taking out loans for the last three years. I've been left with about $60k in debt. I got a job about 6 months after school, solely because of my extracurricular activities in college and not because of my degree. I lucked out.

I make $35k a year and I live well, but frugal. I moved close to work to ease the commute, I live in a house with several other twenty-somethings for cheaper rent, etc. My school loans are around $600 a month, more than my rent or any other bills.

In all, I think I'm in the median for a lot of people who are repaying their loans - I'm just scraping by (after food, insurance, loans, rent, utilities and gas I'm left with about $150 a month extra, but that's on paper. Go to a movie, take a girl out for dinner and that's quickly gone. Basically, that's an entertainment budget.)

Before we go any further, I want to put in my two cents about the argument you **know** will appear below, and that's the one that ""You knew what you were doing before you took the loans, so don't complain about them."" (my own dad tells me this).

My parents told me I had to go to college. It wasn't an option. Even further, they promised jobs (they didn't know the economy would collapse, not their fault) but they had a critical flaw in logic: letting 18-year-old RDC2 make any financial decision that would affect him for two decades.

You see, 18-year-olds are idiots. I was an idiot at 18, and here, at 24, I don't know if I'm much better. I should not have been allowed to make that decision. My parents put the blame on me, but they raised me. They know how poorly I made choices. Taking life-altering loans out at that age is so awful, I can't believe normally rational people justified it so thoroughly.

The fact is, 18-year-olds do **not** understand what they are doing when they take out loans. They've never done it before, they don't understand credit. They understand how it works, but it doesn't have an appropriate weight in their brains. It's a fault in logic for all the naysayers. (Although that won't stop anyone from commenting as such, I'm sure.)

**Psychological weight of student debt:** For those of us saddled with student debt who happened to back their way into a job like me, it seems the biggest issue with student debt isn't the money we're losing by having to pay back loans, but it's the anvil hanging over our head.

If I lose my job, I'm screwed. If I have a major car or medical bill, I'm screwed. If I get demoted, I'm screwed. If the tax structure changes in any way, I'm screwed. If I get a moving violation and my insurance goes up, I'm screwed. If I get kicked out of my house for some reason and living expenses go up at all, I'm screwed. I'm teetering on the balance.

Mostly, this isn't sustainable. My loans last for 12 years, and I'm one year through. So for 11 years, I have to have a net positive income from where I sit now in order not to default on my loans. If I have one misstep, it's over. This is the biggest issue for me.

I'm missing out on $600 a month that could go in my pocket. But I'm young and poor. I've never had that kind of disposable income, so it doesn't have any tangible weight in my brain. I've never been able to spend, so the fact that I don't have doesn't seem to affect me.

Really, what keeps me awake at night is knowing that if one little thing goes wrong, even if I've been paying loans for years, I could be unequivocally screwed. No bankruptcy, no loans, higher deposits, no car, wage garnishment. My life would be miserable.

I realize that many people can't pay their student loans and have both financial and psychological stress about that. You are worse off, I am thankful to have a job. But it's a different kind of emotional toll, in that the anvil is teetering above us on the edge (yes, it would be worse if it already fell).

What kind of toll is this kind of psychological stress going to have on our generation? Does it force us to make decisions, to be decisive? Or to curl up in a ball and cry? Does pressure make diamonds? Or does pressure just make garbage more compact?

I didn't file my taxes for 2008, 2009 , 2010.  You see, you can file the current year's taxes with up to three previous years.  I am a parent, qualify for Head of Household and EIC.  I typically see a return of approx $3000 or more.

I did rehab those loans last year and qualified for a lovely program that will see all my fees and interest knocked off and a fix to my credit.  I walked my ass into a tax accountant's office last week and we talked. 

She called me last night and explained that not only did I play the system, but I was due 3% interest on my money.  Not stellar, but more than I would have earned otherwise.  And so, in the next 6-8 weeks I will receive a check for just under $18,000.

Issue:  Japan is primarily a cash society and places don't generally take credit cards.  I have a travel visa card that I've been using to take out cash.  When I opened the account and the guy was explaining everything to me, I left with the impression that I could take out up to $200 a day.  Cool.  

Well after my first week and a half here I ran out of cash and tried to take out some more.  Card declined. Hmmm.  So I call and they're like actually $200 is the maximum amount of cash you can EVER take out until you pay it off.  Which takes several days to process.  They said that I could apply to increase my limit, but since I'm under 21 they would have to mail a form to my parents.  Which would also take awhile.  Also it isn't guaranteed to be accepted.  They say I have $80 still available to take out in cash.  So I put my card in the ATM again aaaaaand it only gives cash in increments of 10,000 yen, which is more than that.  So that's not going to work.  

So I'm like well okay this sucks, good thing I have a debit card!  So I whip it out and try using that at the ATM and it says my PIN is wrong.  Which it isn't as far as I know?  I've used it in the states just fine.  So I call the international help number on the back of my debit card.  Aaaaand they're closed.  Great.  They operate on ET and I'm kind of in Japan.  So now I'm getting increasingly concerned.  

I go back to my apartment and attempt to pay off the credit card and do the online chat help thing.  She says that my card isn't restricted or anything so I must be entering my pin wrong.  Which I'm not.  She says well sometimes foreign atms only take the first four digits.  But my pin is only 4 digits...Well you should try another ATM.  Problem.  That was the closest ATM to my apartment that will accept foreign cards, which is already fairly far to walk.  I don't have a car or money for bus fare.  So I'd have to walk like 5 miles. And it's typhoon season so it's POURING.  Can't you just reset my pin?  Well I can mail a new one to you or you can go to the nearest bank of america branch.  But I can only mail it to the address you have on file, which is my parents' house in the states.  And oh wait you're in Japan so I guess there aren't any branches there... At this point I start crying and she says that there's nothing she can do.

So I don't get to eat tonight because I have no money.  I don't know when I'll be able to obtain money.

EDIT: Let me just say that I was VERY lucky. I go to a very prestigious university that is a top 5 engineering school in the nation. I got their premiere merit-based scholarship that pays all my tuition and fees. And with the other smaller scholarships that I've received, I actually make a profit off of college and I run a surplus. I know that isn't realistic for most people, which is why I say that I am extremely lucky to have received that. Also, I don't receive any financial aid.

This job is all of my ""saving money"" to put into my Roth and other accounts. During the summer I don't take classes and I work full time at the Fortune 500, and keep both of my other jobs. I also don't have a car. I don't want to pay for the rip-off of downtown parking. I ride my bike to work everyday, rain or shine.
I am proud to to that I'm three years in to college and my parents have yet to pay a dime for my education, but like I said, there is a lot of luck involved with the scholarships. But I'll tell you one thing, those jobs are straight 
up hard work. Lucky plays no part in that money.

EDIT2: I come from a very frugal middle class family. My dad is a mechanic and my mom is a nurse. They've worked very hard and saved their entire lives so that they I would be able to get a great education. It's nice that I can do this for myself and they can put that money towards themselves. They deserve it.

I started back in 1981, used actual data for stock and bond returns and inflation data up through 2012, and then projected expected values beyond 2012 using historical data.

In regards to the title question, it turns out that this person would live a very comfortable retirement.

My hypothetical person graduates college in 1980 at the age of 22 with no debt and no savings, he begins his career Jan 1 1981 with a salary of $15,350 ($38,000 in 2011 dollars, the national average salary for recent college graduates). He receives a raise every year of 2% above inflation, and retires December 31, 2011 at the age of 53 with a final salary of $67,591.

He begins his career by saving a modest 10% of his salary. Every year he increases his savings by 1% until 1986 when he stops at 15%. Then, in 2002, at the age of 44, he increases his savings to 25% for the last 10 years of work.

This person follows a very basic plan for his retirement accounts. Starting in 1981, he allocates 20% towards bonds (US Aggregate Bond Index), and 80% towards stocks (S&amp;P 500 Index). Every year, on Jan 1, he rebalances his portfolio (and adjusts his contributions) to have 1% more in bonds. Finally, in 2011, he holds a 50/50 split for the remainder of his retirement.

I averaged yearly returns into a monthly breakdown, and subtracted standard Vanguard fees (0.17% for S&amp;P 500, 0.10% for Aggregate Bonds). This should be an accurate approximation (without requiring a significantly more intensive month-by-month breakdown of returns), while allowing for natural monthly contributions like a normal worker would make.

Using the SSA retirement calculator, I entered all of our hypothetical person's wages in. In 2020 his SS benefits will kick in (age 62) and he will get $1607 (2020 dollars) per month. The monthly amount will continue to be adjusted each year to account for inflation. In 2033 the retirement benefits will be reduced by 25%.

In conclusion, our example can retire and live on 80% of his salary for the rest of his life, and, after dieing at the age of 100, leave an account to his children with $2,972,487 in it ($740,918 in 2012 money).

Standard disclaimers apply; future returns cannot be predicted by historical actuals, etc. etc.

I'll follow this post up with tables showing various calculations and data.

1375473468.0,80,self.personalfinance,1jl29b,Well. I'm fucked. Please help me?,121,41,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1jl29b/well_im_fucked_please_help_me/,"Hey. I'm living with my mother and brother. Money situation was always bad but this month e erything literally went to pot.            
             
My mom retired with no retirement fund that she can touch until April, and even then, its on 1,400$. She was forced into retirement because of a condition she has making her unable to work from her doctor. My brother is a veteran receiving disability until now... Today he told me he was no longer receiving it because he missed an important evaluation appt with a doctor. He will only receive money when he goes to college which will be in the fall and its not nearly where he was before.        
         
So basically in a matter of a month our family lost 4000$ a month. I am the only one working and on a good month I make 900$. I just got back from a second job interview but I think its minimum wage and only 20 hours a week.            
                
They won't talk to me about bills or even let me see them and they freak out when I get angry about the situation. This is all I know:            
              
* we have a phone plan for 240$ a month. I'd like to cut it but its a 2 year contract and its a fee to close the lines. We went into because we had the money st the time and the condition my mom has came on suddenly and hard.         
               
* we just cut off cable and only have internet now and its going to be about 70$ a month for it. We also have Netflix for 10$ a month.                
             
* my Mom is making an appt to see if we can get assistance with gas and electric bill because we obviously have limited income.     
            
* groceries for a month cost us about 200$. We have two dogs that run us about 50$ a month.                   
             
* my mom says she is going to talk to her credit union about back-taxes on the property because the property tax is 600$ some. I don't honestly know if that's monthly or yearly. That's ridiculous if its monthly. The credit union is holding payments on her house and car until she gets disability because she has disability insurance so I don't have to worry about that until she has her own income.         
              
Everything is a big secret in my household, I guess. There's a lot of bills that were never paid because my mother never told us they needed paid and would hide the bills or make online statements thru her email so we couldn't get them. I have no clue how much she might owe on anything but I did find out at one point last year, she was 70,000$ in debt.               
             
I have no money saved back. dumb, I know. I kept paying on bills and things we needed and then the stress would get me and I needed to buy something small for myself to help relax. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to talk about it if no one will hear me out over here. It turns into an argument. She flipped because I canceled cable but we can't afford it!

Today, the 401k manager came in for a lunch Q&amp;A. I let him give his whole speech first. Some things I noticed:

* He seemed like a nice guy.^I
* He hardly mentioned Target Date Funds which 90% of people in my company should be using.
* He spent half of his time explaining how to rebalance your portfolio and of course pushed the higher expense ratio funds^II
* He talked about specific stocks that have increased tenfold in the last 4 years (cherry picked data, oh my!) so if you put individual stocks in your portfolio you might make a lot of money off of them.

When he was done, I asked why their expense ratio + fees are 8x higher than my IRA's, and higher still than other people's 401k's (I didn't mention the other people were from /r/personalfinance). He replied that because it's a managed fund (pretty sure it's a simple index fund, but what do I know), it costs more. He also said that companies like Vanguard will sneak additional fees in, so their ratios are higher than they advertise. Newly Hired CFO seemed to deflect the question a little on 401k guy's behalf, so I didn't press any further. I figured I'd just show the CFO the numbers later--no point in getting confrontational.

But *then*, a couple hours later, Newly Hired CFO pulled me into his office and told me that he immediately noticed this too, and he didn't like the answers he got when he called him about it. He's already in the process of finding a replacement, so we'll be done with this company soon enough. Even our former CFO didn't catch this--let this be a warning!

So, thanks to everyone who helped. I might not have been brave enough to speak up and look smart for a day without your help!

* We are always trying to cut back on eating out...we don't do it a ton, but we really enjoy good food, and it's expensive. 
* We live across the street from an excellent coffee shop and enjoy some good espresso that you cant make at home occasionally. Probably 1-2 times a week.
* We have also had a lot of travel since we moved away from home. Friend's weddings, holidays back home, etc. add up. We are moving closer to home this summer so we should have far fewer $400 flights to buy (thank goodness).
* We have 3 animals: 2 cats and a 50 lb dog. They are fairly low maintenance but occasionally are expensive. They also require us to rent a house (currently $1295/mo instead of a $900 apt, probably going up when we move) since no apartments in their right mind will allow 3 animals. I cant say I blame them. We are stuck with them though, my wife wont hear about letting the cats go live with her parents. Oh well. Pick your battles, right?

So, I filed my taxes as independent for the 2012 tax year because legally, I am. I am 100% financially independent and have little contact with my parents. However, they had the scumbag who files their taxes amend MY tax return without my consent. In their amended return, they re-filed me as dependent AS WELL AS not a full time college student, so they could get more money from the federal government. Now, the IRS wants my education credit for $2,500 back, and I received a bill in the mail today. I'm trying to work with the IRS to prove that I did not file this amended return to take away my independent status and my education credits. Didn't my parents commit tax fraud? They cannot file my taxes for me without consent because I am a legal adult, correct? Obviously, they're trying to screw me over for their own gain. Can I take legal action against them? What do I tell the IRS? Thank you guys. I appreciate any advice.

EDIT: reading the IRS laws on education credits, a dependent student can't claim education expenses. Also, I spoke to my parents. They forged my signature and amended my tax return, claiming me as dependent. They did this so they could claim my college expenses for themselves, and receive the education tax credit. I'll let the IRS know this and get it cleared up. My parents are not willing to give my money back, or even admit they did anything wrong. I'll look into pressing some sort of charges.

I am 30 years old and I do not like where my life has stalled out at. I work as a collector, and I do not enjoy my job one bit. I happened upon it when I was a bit younger, and the bonus potential fueled my decadent 20s. However, money is not everything and since the recession the industry has really lost its luster.

Upon reading a post on here a few days ago, I started to think rather deeply. A redditor had a question about his aging mother not having a retirement, and the main response was that she'd likely work until her body would not allow her and live in poverty for the rest of her days unless the son would be able to take her in. This concept shook me to the core, as collections (at least where I work) does not have a retirement package for its workers. Every day it gets worse at my job, and I'm fairly close to snapping, because I feel like I've settled and not made any strides toward my real goals in life. 

So, here's my story: Through a technical fuck up in some paperwork over a decade ago, I was not allowed to finish my schooling until all of my loans were zeroed out, not after I graduated, but right then and there. I won't go into the specifics because it's quite boring, but suffice it to say that instead of doing what I wanted (or at least what I THOUGHT I wanted to do) at the time, I went right into the work force at 19 and have been there since, having paid absolutely zero on my loans because I've lived on my own, living check to check. I dated a girl who lived with me for four years, still didn't use any of that freedom to better my situation, one of the reasons she rightly left me. She moved out, I kept the expensive half of a house to rent on my own, which has only worsened my prospects for living the dream, so to speak. 

Well, after reading that post on here, I came to think that I'd do well in downgrading my living conditions to something more frugal, maybe a one bedroom. Today, while telling my mother this same thing, she asked me to come live her and pay everything off and go on to do big things like she's always known I would. She's also struggling as a divorcee taking on the mortgage by herself. I'd also be spending a lot of time fixing up her house, and providing my brother with much needed companionship, which he is very much lacking in a small town where all of his friends have gone on to college and moved away. 

The way I look at it, if I was very strict, I could zero everything out in one year's time, and then return to school to get a degree. 

Is this idea wrong? My pride tells me that 30 and living with Mom is a bad idea. However, I feel like it could also provide a big stepping stone to securing a future far less troubled than I envision it right now.

4% of $2 Million is $80,000. Between dividends, bond interest, and capital gains it is OK to withdraw 4% of your portfolio each year. Ideally you would live off the interest and not touch the principal. Withdrawing 4% won't guarantee that you won't touch principal but it is pretty damn likely you won't outlive your money either.

I didn't take into account that contribution limits will increase in the future, so it will be possible to put even more in these accounts.

[cross posted to r/RealEstate],120,41,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1jj28a/help_21_yo_prospective_first_time_buyer_45k_in/,"###This is such a great community, thank you in advance for all the insight and ideas. I respect your opinions and thank you for sharing them intelligently. I'll try to be concise, but here is the TL;DR: 21 years old/45k in savings/12k in car loan debt/ self-employed/ 200k 3BDR Condo - Offer accepted/  Should I buy a condo? What else could I do with 10-20k?

I am 21, self-employed and currently have just over 45k in savings. For the past 2.5 (nearing 3 in October) years, I have been renting below my means and working hard at starting my business (which I won't go too much into). This is what has allowed me to build up my savings. I am a naturally frugal person, and am much more disciplined than most Americans with my money(the main exception being food/eating out/groceries). 

I have always dreamed of being a ""business owner"" (that was my childhood word for self-employed) and it feels great to be my own boss and to not have conformed to the parts of the ""American dream"" I don't subscribe to (namely, a college education and a 9-5 job). My other long time wish has been home ownership.  One thing about renting that I do not like is the feeling that any improvements or alterations are at my cost and the landlords benefit (let alone the rent itself). I feel I would really love owning a my own place, and taking pride in caring for it. I also like real estate as an investment mode because it is fairly hands-free once the property is secured. Just sit on it and let it build equity,  while watching the market to sell at the RIGHT time. Overall I feel this is a lower-risk investment type, and it doubles as my housing. The third main benefit is that it would allow me more space to meal plan and keep leftovers (I currently have limited fridge/kitchen access). Plus, if I choose to re-locate I could just rent out the property. 

I know for sure I want to move out of the room I rent now. But, is this the right time in life for me to purchase? I prefer a Condo to a home because: 1) it has less maintenance, specifically the yard which I don't have much use for anyway. 2) It will make me feel a bit more secure as there are many neighbors to keep an eye on me and usually they are in gated communities. 3) they come with some amenities (pool, bbq, gym). 4) I generally prefer a smaller spaces (or, as small as is functional and cozy) and do not believe that biggest is the best in this case. I have to clean and maintain the thing after all, so as small as possible! 5) The property tax will help lessen my tax burden...my 1099 last year was 80k and being single with no dependents and few deductions.....that hurt!!! 

My main concerns are: 1) America's economy fails and I have to hold onto the property longer than planned (3-5 years, or longer as a rental-income) and/or struggle to find tolerable tenets. 2) my job situation changes, or my desires change and I want to move out of this area, but am locked in to living in the property for 2 years due to FHA financing. (in this case, I could sell, if the market is right..which, who's to say?) NOTE: I expect, should my situation change I would still easily be able to afford my mortgage so long as I could keep tenets at all times (20% vacancy is average in suburban areas, correct?) So it is not the cost that worries me as much as the lack of mobility/freedom. 3) I decide purchasing is the right move, but buy a property that itself (specifically) is not a good equity-earner and under-performs vs the surrounding community. Hence why I ask for advice in choosing the right property. 

Reddit, guide me!

-----------------------

###Do you think I am ready? What questions can I ask myself in reflection to help decide for myself whether or not this is the right move at the right time?

##IF YES: 
**What are good investment features to look for in a condo? So far I have:**
 Location (near schools, shopping, public transport, low crime rate); having a balcony or patio; community amenities; having access to parking (garaged is best, then covered then outdoor, with guest space availability being another factor); having laundry in-unit; the owner vs renter population of the complex; and lastly the CC&amp;R bylaws (how strict etc.)
**Are condos as good of investments as homes?** If this varies by area, how can I tell based on where I live?  
**Which is easier to rent out** in full (meaning the whole condo vs the whole home)? Which would be easier to sublease as a live-in landlord: 2 extra rooms  in a Condo, or 2 extra rooms in a home, generally? 

##IF NO: 
**What are other good alternatives to real estate, should I choose to continue renting?** I have 10-20k to play with (I like to keep 20-25k as liquid savings, as I am self-employed and do not own a disability policy) and  prefer something somewhat low-risk. I am young, so I ""have the time to risk"" I suppose, but I am not sure where life will take me and a Condo could be rented out should I choose to re-located etc.

I have a Bachelor's in English, but I went back to school to get a technical certificate in Video Production. I was lucky enough to get some video production gigs right out of school, but a freelancer's income was, and still is is, a roller coaster. I'm currently working with a live event production company and they barely call me.

My current income is not conducive to my student loan payments and planning for my future. I'm currently working gigs only to cover my loans. I have no savings, barely any money for any social activities, so I've recently reconfigured my spending habits. Because I want to work in production, I would like to save up money for a great camera while also putting money away for ""rent"". My loans top out at about $600 a month, so I need to save up a good chunk of change before I move out. I've decided to take 20% out of every check I get, put 10% toward a camera and 10% toward ""the future"". It's modest, but with my bills I need to start small.
My goal is to continue to work freelancing jobs (because the money is great) but also find a part time or full time job. My question is where do I start? Aside from production, my skills are based in customer service. I enjoy interacting with the public and need constant stimulation to feel satisfied.

Ideally, I'd like to aim high and apply to production companies in the area, but I find myself having a hard time letting them know that I will do ANYTHING. I would enjoy working as a receptionist or a production assistant. I don't want to seem desperate, but I don't want to take no for an answer either.

If that doesn't work out I'm OK with taking a non-production job. My question is what are some websites I can go through to find work? I'm on Monster, but I don't think I'm utilizing it correctly. The only other place I look is Craigslist, but I'm in the Baltimore area and I'm finding that there are a lot of fake jobs on there.

Hi r/personalfinance!  I've read so many posts where fantastic advice is overflowing and I need some help.

Here is a breakdown of my situation for context:

* 26 years old with an undergrad degree
* Income: I have a job where I work from home and make 40k/yr, which after taxes and other deductions my take home is just over $1,000 every 2 weeks
* Expense: Car payment is $300/month (2004 Ford Explorer XLT)
* Total Owed for Car: About $5000
* Car Value (Kelly Blue Book): About $4000
* Expense: Car insurance is $100/month
* Expense: Rent is $200/month (I live with mom)
* Expense: Student Loan (Sallie Mae) is $600/month
* Expense: Student Loan (Federal) is  $300/month
* Total Student Loans: About $50k
* Expense: Cell phone is $20/month
* Credit Card: Capital One is maxed at $500 (used it for an emergency car repair), minimum payment is $15/month
* Credit Card: Orchard Bank is maxed at $750 (mostly for a plane ticket (I volunteer coach a team and we're flying to nationals), plus assorted other expenses), minimum payment is $25/month

If you need any other information that might be relevant, I'm more than happy to share.  I just feel like every week I spend my whole paycheck.  I feel like I can never save money, and I'll never be able to move out unless my job gives me a promotion/raise.  Even then, it'll cover rent but I'd still be breaking even.

Three years ago I was in a similar situation to [this poster](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/16xyu9/im_22_and_just_got_a_full_time_job_and_need_some/)--out of college at 22, $20k in student loans, purchased a car on a 5 year loan, remained at home.  Now, three years later, I brought my car loan interest rate way down and the years down ($2100 with 5-6 payments left), all student loans paid off, and have remained at home this entire time.

So now I start to wonder--where do I go from here?  I make about $47k this year and about $49k starting in July, currently take home about $2300/mo, and I'm up to about $17.5k in the bank (low interest rate in savings) so I have plenty of ""emergency"" funds, and I do pay into a work retirement fund (public school district, in IT) that is a strange setup and I don't know the specifics of it, but may who I've talked to say unless I stay for the rest of my career, which I'm unlikely to do, then another retirement plan is probably a good idea and a better carryover to a potential new job.  I do also at some point want to finally look to buy a house, either with a friend or maybe even alone if possible.

I'm leaning into looking to start a Roth IRA, but I'm unsure just how much I want to pay into it--$1-2k a year or closer to the maximum.  

Just looking for advice while also keeping my options open.  I haven't gone on a vacation or the like for a little while but would love to be able to keep some funds floating around to some travel, rebuild my gaming desktop later this year, etc etc.

I run a smallish business (18 full time staff) and all the talk on here recently about retirement had me thinking about what we offer our employees. So I met with our retirement guy. He runs his own business and our retirement is through Oppenheimer. 

We currently offer a 2% match whether the employee chooses to invest or not and its vested after 90 days. I talked to him about possibly changing this to be a little more generous, but here is where it got weird:

I asked him about the expense ratio fees on our account and he got very nervous and sort of angry all of the sudden. He said that the fees depend on whether the employee chooses ""A Shares"" or ""C Shares"" and that they range from 1.35%(A) to 2.05% (C). Reading through the Vanguard info it sounds like we are getting ripped off pretty good by these people but I wanted to make sure I wasn't overreacting. 

When I asked him about Vanguard, his face got bright red and he said that I shouldn't just consider funds that aren't actively managed, because even though he couldn't offer returns like vanguard, there were other problems with them. He couldn't name any of the problems, but he said they were there. 

Any other small business owners out there want to weigh in? Did I miss something with this guy? Or should we consider switching retirement accounts? 

Also, how would a small business owner set up vanguard accounts for my business?

* Convert the house to apartments. Our state requires us to live apart to get a divorce, but we may be able to get by on this technicality.

The upside is we would not have to negotiate custody until our daughter is a few years older. 
* Rent the house until the market turns around. The downside is that a competitive rent would barely be our mortgage payment, so upkeep would be out of pocket. 
* Walk away. Downside, all houses, cars, and apartments would have to be cash or cosigned for years to come.

Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated.

My wife was married previously. They owned a home together and at some point took a second line of credit to support a business idea of his. Long story short, her 34 year husband cheated on and started dating a 17 year-old employee. 

The courts made the following ruling:

* The ex owes my wife $70k, but only when the house sells
* My wife continues to pay her half of the mortgage until the house sells
* Any changes or decisions about the house must be made together

Before I met my wife, she was obviously pissed and has never paid her half of the mortgage, which I think is/was a mistake.  The house was put on the market and has yet to sell, 5+ years later. We’ve driven by the house and it appears the ex-husband is either living in or renting the house. There has been some construction and improvements done on the home, all of which have been done without the consent of my wife; we don’t really care either way.

We called the bank and the loan is in good-standing, each month has been paid consistently over the past several years. We believe that through his guilt, he has been taking care of the payments to avoid any confrontations.

So here is my question; I’m currently finishing up a graduate school.  In less than a year will be making decent money. Until that point, we are living frugally and have little disposable income. What is the best way to approach this situation?  Should we call and try to have him carry the rest of the debt? Should we start paying our half of the mortgage? Should I wait until I am making money to confront this situation?

Thanks, any advice would be appreciated!

Edit: If it were me, I would want to be paying the mortgage as the courts ruled. She made the decision not to before we met, now we are in a position where we can not afford that, yet.

1360716721.0,73,self.personalfinance,18evo2,how bad will my credit be marked for totally stopping rent payments? more details to the situation inside. (long story),102,29,128,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/18evo2/how_bad_will_my_credit_be_marked_for_totally/,"skip to the bottom if you want to get straight to the point.

my friend and i signed the lease on an apartment a few months ago.  the lease is written so that we both are responsible for the total cost of rent, not that each of us are responsible for a specific portion. well, since day 2 we have had problems. her boyfriend has been living with us the entire time, starting on the second day we moved in. 

to my knowledge, he hadn't paid a cent. when i finally sat them down and told them he would have to start pitching in, my roommate told me  ""oh he has been helping with rent. he splits it with me"" 

so i was paying half while they each paid 1/4. i told them that would not fly and he needed to pay 1/3. he agreed. next month, rent is due, he said he couldn't come up with any of it so i had to shit out the extra that i hadn't been planning on (ended up having to borrow from a family member)

they haven't paid a single bill on time, i pay the ones in my name secretly so my credit doesn't get shit on, then just nag them acting like our utilities are going to get shut off if we don't pay soon.

they would both come home trashed 6 nights a week and just scream at the top of their lungs about whatever the hell made them angry that night ""FUCKING NIGGERS ACROSS THE STREET TALKING LOUD"" like, it is completely ridiculous.

she got her boyfriend a dog for christmas. the dog lives with us, obviously. the dog is not potty trained (nor do they try to train him, poor thing) and is completely destructive. he has torn the SHIT out of our carpet and bathroom door.

recently, my grandmother was hit by a car and needs a bunch of surgery, and doesn't have anyone living with her. i decided that this would be a perfect opportunity, i can move out and help my grandma with rent and drive her to and from the hospital and help her around the house while she recovers. then, i can get some peace and quiet so i am able to study and sleep.

she works 30 hours a week, he works 20 hours a week, they both have the option of adding on as many hours as they want, even going full time if they want. neither of them are in school, nor do they have hobbies that they spend time doing outside of work. they simply sit at home and watch tv all day and get drunk. they are unwilling to add more hours on to their schedule even though they struggle to come up with rent every month.

I moved in with my grandma a month ago, tried to get the roommates to resign the lease with my name off of it and the new boyfriends name on it. i paid 2 my 1/3 of rent for 2 months while i am not living there. She called me tonight saying that she wont resign the lease because shes too stressed, and that i need to go back to paying 1/2 of rent even though i'm not living there, and even though i should only be paying 1/3 if i was living there. 

**START READING HERE IF YOU WANT TO SKIP THE BACK STORY**

i have 3 options. 
1. i pay $1500 to break the lease. this would require her to agree, and at this point i think she is being difficult just for the hell of it.
2. i continue to pay rent and risk her not coming up with her part of it (VERY likely. i have had to save her ass several times on rent) and have my credit be shit on
3. i don't pay a cent more and have my credit shit on (because i think that will likely happen anyway)

i am 20 years old, hardly no credit. i don't intend on buying a car or house, or even leasing an apartment in the next 4 years while i'm still in college. my parents are wealthy and financially very supportive of me and could help if something unexpected happened like my car breaking down. i realize that option 2 and 3 would mean my credit would be fucked over. how terribly? has anyone gone through something like that and how hard was it to recover? i am honestly thinking option 3 would be the easiest for me at this point, are there other repercussions that i am not thinking about? will the leasing office sue us and force me to pay or just evict her?

STILL TL;DR
what happens when you quit paying rent?

EDIT: i already have my name off all of the utilities, so at least that part is taken care of. i'm off to bed for the night and will update tomorrow after trying to settle with the leasing office again.


**EDIT 2** thank you guys for all of your advice and support. i am leaving for work now and will be stopping in at the leasing office today after work to see what kind of deal i can try to strike with management. my dad said he is unable to help me get my appliances and silverware out until this weekend, but i will be out of town this weekend so we will probably do that on tuesday of next week. i'm sure i'll update before then, but if i don't get around to it then i will definitely update on tuesday to let you know how that went.

I just don't know the best route for that. I've looked into dividend stocks. But I would need an extremely large sum of money to live off just that. Tens of millions of dollars to generate a few tens of thousands of dollars a year. 

I've looked into owning my own business, but that may even be more time consuming and stressful than working for someone else. 

I've looked into owning rental property or passive income streams, still, there is a large amount of time spent keeping and maintaining both of those that they will eliminate the personal freedom I desire, even if they do liberate me from working for someone else.

His income is about $1200 twice a month, on the 1st and 15th (his housing is already taken out of this).

He is in over his head in credit card debt and car payments. I have been talking to him about creating a budget, and a debt snowball plan.

His plan reflected that pretty well.

He told me today during our talk that his wife wants plastic surgery (liposuction, etc), because she doesn't like her body since she had her baby. She has shopped around and found the surgery as low as $5000. I told him that he absolutely should not let her go through with this, but he says their relationship is on the mends and she says it's the only thing that will make her feel happy. I understand him wanting to please his wife, but I cannot understand going further into debt for this.

How do you strike a healthy balance between saving, and spending money?

I'm 29 and I'm in pretty good shape financially. No debt, good job, good savings and I'm well educated. I save about 1/3rd of my before-tax income. 

However, I've noticed a couple of things about myself that I don't think are nice:

1) I think I've started viewing my savings as if it were a high score in a video game. I have zero interest in showing off my ""success"" to the neighbor, but privately, I definitely get a bit of a high when I look at my savings. This just fuels my impulse to spend less and save more.

2) If I'm being very honest with myself, I privately enjoy a sense of smug satisfaction when I watch my peers, who're most definitely in debt, blow their money on expensive BMWs and clothes and just generally be quite irresponsible with money. There are loads of people with advanced engineering degrees who don't grasp the basics of personal finance. I often pat myself on the back when I see this. This can't be healthy. 

Because of all this, I have difficulty spending money. I am unable to make large purchases like cars because I can't justify buying a rapidly depreciating asset. The trouble is, I love cars. I spend 30 minutes everyday drooling over the new Subaru BRZ, a car that I think people would agree that I can easily afford. But I'm nowhere close to buying it.

I am afraid I will turn into Scrooge McDuck. I don't want to have an unhealthy, obsessive relationship with money. We all have a limited time on this earth, and we can't take our money with us when we die. I don't believe in dynastic wealth, so leaving behind money for my kids doesn't interest me. I need to find a healthy balance somewhere between Wesley Snipes and Uncle Scrooge. Please share your wisdom with me.

What, aside from saving, should I be doing to prepare for that?",91,18,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1608zt/my_goal_is_to_be_able_to_buy_a_house_at_the/,"I'm new to this subreddit so please forgive me if I forget some of the details. Here's what I'm working with:

I am almost 24, living at home with my parents, and working at a full-time job where I take home about $1,880 per month. Right now, my savings total $12,000. I have very few expenses as I don't pay rent, and my car is already paid for. Since starting work, I have comfortably been able to save $1,200 per month, which I am hoping to continue this year barring any major hiccups. At the end of this year, I hope to save at least another $12,000, but hopefully more, and then the ultimate goal would be to begin looking for a home next year. 

On top of my savings, I also contribute to a pension ($2,200 per year, which I cannot touch until I retire) and a ROTH IRA, which currently has $16,000 that I could access for a home purchase, but would rather not raid entirely. I also have $2,400 in savings bonds.

So, my biggest goals this year are to continue saving and to get a credit card, as I don't have one now. My first question is, will building up credit over the next year allow me to apply for a loan next year, or is that just not enough time to build credit? I am very new to this and have always been kind of scared of having a credit card, so I'm sorry if that question seems very naive. 

Secondly, I wonder if, given all this information, it is even realistic for me to be thinking about buying a home next year. I live in New England where home prices are not exactly cheap, but I've been trying to shop around and get an idea for what's out there, and there is a small but significant number of homes available for under $150,000, which is what I imagine would be the absolute peak of my budget, if that.

Thank you in advance for any advice you can offer! I love this subreddit and thank you guys for all your help. 
 

EDIT: I should also mention that apartments around where I live are pretty expensive, usually around 900-1200 per month, depending upon size. To me, it makes more sense to save my pennies and invest in something of my own rather than throw that money into someone else's property. Plus, that's more than half of my take-home pay, which would leave me totally strapped. I would rather save up for a down-payment and then have a more manageable mortgage payment, but believe me when I say that I am new to all of this and really have no idea what I'm doing, so feel free to tell me if that plan sounds completely idiotic. 

Thank you!

I'm a recent college grad and I've been working as an hourly employee for a large corporation since graduation. This past week I was offered to come on as a full-time salaried employee and I'm not sure if it is appropriate for try and negotiate my salary?


Details:

- I would gain vacation time, benefits, 401k, etc. I still get paid overtime

- The work I will be doing as a salaried employee isn't on the same level as that of what I was brought on to do when I was originally hired. I was hired to basically proofread documents, but I will be working in more of an analyst role (which I have started transitioning to the past couple weeks)

- My salary is noticeably lower than that of the low end salary for analysts (according to glassdoor)

- I have a really good working relationship with my manager

I guess my only hesitation is that in this market I don't particularly want to rock the boat at my place of employment. I am super excited to begin working as a real employee, but the salary does have me rather bummed.

What should I do? Should I address this to my manager?


**** UPDATE ****
I brought this up with my manager asking for $6,000 / yr increase in Salary. After a couple days she calls me into her office and agrees to increase it to that amount. No negotiation needed. Sadly, what I'm gathering is that I didn't ask for a high enough salary and I could have gotten more. None the less, I'm certainly happy with my noticeably larger paycheck!

A lot of people easily did this by buying not only their groceries at grocery stores, but got 6% cashback on a lot of other items too - by buying gift cards (Shell/Mobile/BP, Amazon/Best Buy, Gap/American Eagle, etc) at the grocery store (single retailer gift cards typically have no fee to buy beyond money loaded on them). 

This was always officially excluded per cashback policy, but Amex could never tell what you were buying because all they got was the total purchase amount and merchant category code - they could tell you spent $252.31 at a grocery store, not that $102.31 was groceries and you bought $150 in gift cards.

Unfortunately, **as of January 15th, 2013, you will only earn 6% cashback on the first $6,000 in grocery spending per calendar year.** This should be printed on your October statement.

The card should still be worthwhile if you break $2,500 in grocery spend as you'll outdo the rewards of the no annual fee card (including deducting the annual fee from those rewards), but for the highly dedicated people buying a lot of gift cards who would break $6K, this may be a big deal.

More importantly, **realize credit card rewards are never set in stone**. Sometimes the change is positive (e.g. Discover upped the 5% quarterlies to $1500 in eligible spending from a lower amount), but great rewards can always be capped (e.g. Sallie Mae recently capped the grocery and gas 5% cashback on one of their Visa Signature cards).

I requested future communication in writing and that I'll need the charges verified.

I’ve never handled this type of situation before. I had no knowledge of the balance and was never given notice of any outstanding fees until now, 7 months later. I was sure that I had paid everything in-office. I’ve always responded friendlily to customer service, telemarketers, and people in general, but I’m suspicious of this dentist and fear that a friendly response will be taken advantage of. What should be the tone of my response? By phone, email, or certified mail? In California, the Fair Debt Collection Practice applies to original creditors as well as debt collectors. Should I go legal on them in my response?



This is technically the 2nd ~~albeit identical (but for date)~~ letter. The first arrived 1-2 months ago [edit:and was for $800]. Dad, outraged, called them and they said it was an error and to ignore it.

I 'm somewhat suspicious of this lady because an ex-patient told me that some of her procedures are 2-3 times more expensive than neighboring dentists', my current dentist tells me the sealants she reccomended are useless on adults with normal teeth, and b/c they took 3 weeks (1 reminder after 2.9 weeks) to email my x-rays to my new dentist.


I'm confident that I payed my copay and the extra not covered by my insurance with my credit card.




Any input is welcome. Thank you for your perspectives. 

**edit:** checked my credit score (equarian?). Nothing negative reported.

**edit2**: from the 5 responses, it seems like it isn't as much an Armageddon as i had thought. I'm gonna hit the sack now, but will definitely check and reply to comments tomorrow. i'll contact them in person tomorrow to ask for an explanation. however, what are my options if worst case scenario occurs and they press for full payment?

I know that you open an account with a financial institution like Vanguard or Fidelity, who have index funds that track a financial average such as S&amp;P 500, you then contribute money and the maximum so far is $5,500 per year.  The key is that you pay taxes on your contribution when you are putting it into the account, and you pull the money out after retirement without paying taxes again.


You keep contributing for many many years and if the stock market does well for 40 or so years, you will have racked up a considerable amount of ROI on top of your contributions.  Then, you retire and can either keep paying into the account or start pulling money out.


The thing I don't understand is how it works, where your money goes and how it is used.  My guess is that, say you go for the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Class (MUTF) and decide to lay down the maximum at $5,500 into your account right now.  
    
    The current price is $154.26

    1. If you decide to put your money into this index fund, 
       all that means is that you will be buying about 35 shares?

    2. Say the stock market flourishes for 5 months and the price goes up to $160.  
       That means that your account has gained value and it is now $5,600 correct?

    3. So, since there are 2 parts in a Roth IRA account, the contribution and the earnings.  
       That means that your contribution stays at $5500, but your earnings bumps up to $100?

I mostly want to know if I am using the right numbers for the calculations:

My company matches $0.50 for every dollar up to 6% and I'm making $60k to start.

When I'm setting up my 401k I get some options to contribute on a pre-tax, roth, and after-tax basis.  I'm guessing pre-tax is the best so that I can take advantage of my employer's match (they don't offer matching on the other two).  

The next step asks me if I want to increase my contribution by a percentage every year.  Is this something that most people do?  Should I do it?

After that I'm asked if I want to invest in a Target Date Fund (all through Vanguard...2010, 2015, ect, ect, 2050) or if I want to manage my funds on my own.  If I choose the second option then I get a large list of blends, stock investments, and bonds.  Should I just pick a Target Date Fund and go from there?

This is the one of the best tips that work for me. Everyone is different, but a user suggested I post something more detailed than a comment I made earlier, so here it is.


**7.  Set Up a Waiting Period Rule for Non-Essential Purchases**

**Try waiting one day for every $50 you intend to spend on a non-necessity. When the waiting period is over, it’s likely that your impulse to buy will be curbed.  You’ll realize that the item is really not all that important to you.**


[Not the original article that I learned this tip from, but the only one I could find with a similar concept](http://thekrazycouponlady.com/finance/budget-on-the-brain-10-techniques-that-promote-financial-wellness/)

The basic idea and why this works for me is that I get time to think about the purchase logically. Buying a house with this model would obviously take an absurd amount of time, so even waiting a day is sometimes sufficient. For example, you could wait a day for anything over $100 or wait a day for every $100 after that.

We treat our combined net worth as one of those big thermostat-style gauges that we work to improve.

You'll both need to have gmail accounts and your bank accounts will need to be compatible with Mint.com ...

* Create a new Mint.com account using a ""plussed"" Gmail account (learn more about that [here](http://www.wikihow.com/Use-Plus-Addressing-in-Gmail)). For example, john.doe+jane@gmail.com
* Create a custom filter for emails that match this rule (more on that [here](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10957?hl=en)) and forward those emails to your spouse -- this obviously requires that you both approve the setup through gmail.
* Configure all of both of your accounts in Mint.com and setup alerts, budgets, etc., etc. from the perspective of your combined finances.

I worked as a programmer during and after college for a few years until I decided to join the military as an officer.  I have 11 years until I can retire with a 50% basic pay pension. That'll be about 45k/year indexed to inflation.  My spouse is also in the military with 12 years to go. That'll give us about 90k in retirement income starting the day we retire + medical benefits (although those might get taken away depending on what happens with the defense budget the next few years). 

We currently max out all our retirement accounts (11k towards Roth IRAs, 35k towards TSP). Started a coverdell account for our kid so 2k/year goes towards that. The kid's college education is already funded thanks to me transferring post 9/11 GI Bill benefits to the kid.  That will pay the kid a stipend plus cover tuition up to the tuition cost of the most expense state school in the state.  If we have a second kid, then my wife will transfer her benefit to that kid.  We both have our Masters and it's unlikely we'll ever go back to school.

We have 2 debt payments, a mortgage on a house we bought that's now a rental property (owe ~$125k @ 3.25%, house is worth $250k) and a car (owe $14k @ 1.79%). I've been torn about just paying off all the debt, but am glad I didn't since I've had that money in the market with awesome returns the past couple years. 

Net worth is currently $633k. My goal is to have $2m net worth 10 years from now. We're saving $80k/yr and living nicely. Both of us working stressful jobs can be difficult at times, particularly when you look at the amount of time one of us has been deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Qatar.  On the other hand, that has helped us save since your pay is tax free while in a combat zone + additional pay.   

I'm 32, she's 30... We should be retired by 45 and I'll use cash to buy that nice dream home at a location to be determined. The $90k in combined pensions should allow us to live comfortably and do pretty much whatever we want.

After the solar panels were installed we are now paying around $30 a month for our entire energy bill. Everything in total cost us just about $6300.

I have a question. Do you guys agree that it's worth it to take about $100k out of her 401(k) and pay off all her debt? She understand now that she needs to never go into debt again.

A little more info. Probably 3/4 of what she pays in bills every month is to debt repayment and it has left her with no money to enjoy her life at all. She's depressed and scared. She's pretty much one emergency away from bankruptcy. 

She has, however, done really well with her retirement savings and has about $800k in her 401(k). I know it's not good to withdraw funds from retirement accounts, but she will be 59 1/2 in a few months and can avoid the 10% penalty.

This is a woman who's literally in tears every time money comes up, because she's so scared and depressed. 

So, despite the fact that it's not idea to withdraw funds from retirement accounts, what do you guys think, given the circumstances? It would make her so much happier, and I've agreed to help her with her finances after all this so she never goes into debt again. She'll still have money for retirement and plans to withdraw from social security at 65. I, personally, think this is the right move for her. 

If she doesn't do something drastic like this she'll never be out of debt.

I am permanently disabled, and in a wheelchair. Work full time job 40/hours week. I live in Illinois. I've been dependent on my brother for years to get around, and now my ride to work. It works out fine currently because he is having trouble finding a job but when he is employed it will be difficult sharing the car. The car isn’t modified with hand controls for driving.

I really hate being dependent on people and finally just secured my driving license. I went through a state program to train on hand controlled vehicles and will soon start the process to get a modified vehicle. 

DRS/State will pay for the modifications to the vehicle, but I need to cover the cost of the van that is purchased. I am going with a grand caravan(For modifications I was told my choices were a Toyota, Honda or Dodge and Dodge is the cheapest) 

The van cannot be more than 5 years old. I could purchase used, but it must be certified to last at least 5 years and have the lowest mileage possible. For these reasons I’ve waited so long to go through the program since I could never afford a vehicle.

I’m not sure what I can afford now, if anything at all. I don’t want to dig myself in very deep debt but gaining a vehicle will really help with my situation. I could stop my savings of $400 a month, but shouldn’t I be saving at least something? Having a van adds a lot of extra costs too. (insurance, gas, maintenance) but I’m also worried what might happen with the process of getting a modified vehicle if I stop in the middle of it. Everyone knows how state bureaucracy can be. 





#Breakdown:

Income: $735 every 2 weeks.

This is after all my insurance is taken out. Plus $30 for Flex account for medical expenses, which is already depleted of the $750 amount.

Current Expenses:

Rent: $200 (Still live with my family)

Phone: $150 – I pay for my brother’s as well which is why it’s so high. I am working on getting him off. I can’t just shut it off because he is my ride everywhere and I need to be able to get a hold of him. I already downgraded his phone.

Car: $100 - (car bought from family member, shared with brother &amp; his fiance, payment split three ways. Almost paid off)

Student Loan: $350 monthly. 32K in total.

Savings account: $2707.61 - $200 is taken out biweekly.

Discover - $1,078.31  
Monthly Min: $50

Chase     - $2,574.76
Monthly Min: $42

Best Buy  - $233.32
Monthly Min: $35  

Retail - $1,486.44 - I purchased a new tempurpedic bed. I got an expensive one for my back, the foam mattress really helps. I still am within the 30 days so I can return it if I decide I don’t like it or I can’t really afford it. or if there are better, cheaper alternatives
Monthly Min: $65

Care Credit (Dentist) - $1,297.40
Monthly Min: $42

Netflix: $8 monthly

I cancelled Audible/Various Game Subscriptions. Except Netflix.




I am finding it hard to estimate my various medical bills that crop up. Originally I had a Flex spending account to help with them. I used the whole $750 up by April. They aren’t consistent and can range from $30 - $400 per bill. Starting in September I qualify for Medicare B. Which has a cost of 106 per month. I am hoping this will help with the burden of my medical bills but I’m not sure yet how much of the bills they will help with after my primary (Blue Cross/Blue Shield) covers. Is this a good option? I have Combined Insurance to cover ime n case I get  hospitalized, but I am thinking of cancelling it. ($25 monthly).Plus since I qualify for medicare it will cover hospital expenses on their free plan. 




Next year should I take out more for my Flex account? Since it is withdrawn before taxes are applied. Thankfully I am fairly stable medically, but of course things always come up. I’m sure insurance companies just love me.




I know I can apply for a reduced student loan payment based on income, but I’m not sure if it will make a difference. This might seem like a dumb question, but can the payment go up if your income is too high?




Summary of questions, since I wrote a lot:


• Can I afford a vehicle? Used? New? How can I make this happen?


• Should I apply for reduced student loan payments?

• How do I budget for my always changing medical bills?

• Should I take out more on the Flex account in 2014?

• Should I use all of my savings to pay off credit cards? If so which ones first?

• Any other good advice for reducing my overall bills?



I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this.


Edit: Thank you for the replies so far! To clear up confusion. The $735 is net take home. This is after my medical insurance/dental/ FSA and 401k are deducted. 

My degree is in graphic design/ animation. and I live in Northern Illinois, west of chicago.

1361142447.0,68,self.personalfinance,18psb9,I am hemorrhaging money,95,27,135,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/18psb9/i_am_hemorrhaging_money/,"First, let me apologize for another ""blah, blah, blah, what do I do?"" post.  I know this community gets a lot of these, but I am feeling rather frazzled and I just don't know how to handle things.  The women in my life are bleeding me dry!  

Quick back-story.  My fiancee (who I love very much) and I work the same jobs, currently bringing in a net of $40,000/yr each.  She is $45,000 in student loan and car debt, and I am $30,000 in student loan debt. We both work at the same job, a job that we both hate, and we currently work ~80hrs per week.

My fiancee is planning our wedding, and sticking to a (reasonable?) $10,000 budget.  Our honeymoon is planned at $6500, and our wedding rings were $3500, putting the total due at $20,000 by July.  I am putting in about $11500 of this, $2000 of it on an interest free credit card.  Frankly, the $20k is more than I wanted to spend, but after looking at the price of most weddings/honeymoons/rings around the country, it started looking more reasonable, and I didn't really feel I could say no to such a beautiful and important day for the love of my life.

A further large complication is my mother.  She is 48 years old, with $80,000 in student loan debt and $10,000 in defaulted credit cards.  She just graduated with her degree in Business Administration, but she has been unable to find employment.  She is getting kicked out of her home in the next few months.  I currently send her $300/mo, and she is begging me to take out a mortgage on a cheap home in my area (~$80,000) for her to live in.  I don't want to have to do this, but I also don't want my mother (who I love very much and raised me on her own) to be homeless.  I have no siblings that can help with the situation.  My fiancee is against me taking out a mortgage for my mother.  My fiance is also against living with my mother (we live in a small apartment and have no room for my mother and her pets, plus she is quite challenging to live with).

Perhaps this is just a long ramble and there really are no great choices to be made, but perhaps someone here can listen to my sob story and/or give me a friendly pat on the back.  I am just feeling more and more underwater here! :/

**EDIT:**
Thanks to everyone for the great comments.  My fiancee and I had a long talk, and there was some challenge involved, but we have decided to cut down on the honeymoon.  Ideally we will get the cost down to $4000 (flights alone are $2800).  We have also asked wedding guests to only donate money, no gifts.  We anticipate getting about $4000 in wedding money, of which we are putting 100% towards debt. We are also cutting down on personal spending leading up to the wedding, which should save $200/mo.  Lastly, we are going to try to cut $1000 out of our wedding expenses.  All of this will cut our new total down to $11500, which is an OK compromise to me.  
I am going to start paying my mothers rent ($375/mo) while she continues to look for a job, and my uncle is going to pitch in $250/mo towards her living expenses.  This situation isn't ideal, but it keeps her in a house and keeps me out of a mortgage, so I can live with that for now.  Thanks again for the thoughtful ideas!

Also I do have to clarify, we EACH work 80hrs/wk (oil field jobs), and we EACH net $40k/yr.  The lesson here is, don't get just a bachelors in physics! ",,False,,t5_2qstm,1361404836.0,,,True,t3_18psb9,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/18psb9/i_am_hemorrhaging_money/,
1361022136.0,72,self.personalfinance,18mxoq,Question about $1.45 late fee being submitted to collections without ever sending me a paper bill or email,93,21,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/18mxoq/question_about_145_late_fee_being_submitted_to/,"Last summer, I moved. I canceled my gas and electrical service and paid my last bill. Maybe because moving is a mess and I'm forgetful on my best day, I paid my last bill about 2 weeks late. I always pay the full amount shown and I'm not even sure how one would go about paying everything ($95) except the $1.45 late fee without explicitly typing the incorrect amount in -- which I hope I wouldn't do even on my spaciest day. However, based on the last bill that I have on record and the last payment posted, it looks like for whatever reason (a website error?) I payed the billing amount minus the late fee ($95 instead of $96.45). 

Fast forward 6 months: Last night I visited my old utility account online for some unrelated reason. And on the front page, scaring the shit out of me, is a message that says, ""data unavailable: this account is in collections."" Now, to reset my password I had to enter the email address associated with the account, so I know that they know how to reach me by email at least. They also certainly have my phone number, because to access my billing information via phone (they're out of office till Monday), I had to verify the cell number associated with my account. So even if there was some mail forwarding issue, I think I should have been notified of this mysterious overlooked late fee before they sold the debt to collections. But I spent 2 hours going through every bill or remotely official communication I've ever gotten at the new house (I save them all), and there's no bill. I checked my email archive too. Nothing.

I have also failed to receive any information from a collections agency yet. So I have no idea what's going on. Warren Buffett, if you're reading, can you shed any light on what's happening or to what degree this will ruin my life when I try to buy a house in 1-5 years? Thank you in advance to anyone who can offer help or advice. WB or otherwise.

EDIT: I wrote this in anger and wasn't clear. I am absolutely going to pay it as soon as I find out which agency has the debt and/or call the utilities company on Monday. In case it wasn't obvious. I'm not going to refuse to pay a $20-something debt ($1.45 + other fees, I'm assuming) on principle. I might write them a principled angry letter, but that's it.

",85,15,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/162oc8/in_your_opinion_what_features_or_fixes_would/,"I have been using Mint for over a year now, and here are some things I have personally noticed are lacking. I wish they would work on these features. I would pay or even donate to see these fixed:

Create budgets from tags: Currently you can only create budgets using the categories. While you can create your own categories, with tags, you can apply a transaction to multiple budgets or be able to combine tags.

Hide categories so they don't show up in the list: ability to trim the list of expenses. There are some things that never come up, I  should be able to hide the categories so I don't have to scroll forever (especially in the phone app) 

Create ""budgets"" for savings: Mint Canada doesn't have the goals feature, and even if it did, it is more for if you have the goal amount already in mind. What I want is to be able to track, inside mint, the amount of money I want to save in particular accounts as an incentive to do so (also the line should be red then yellow then green when you hit your monthly savings ""budget"")
 
Introduce the goals feature in Canada: as mentioned above, the goals feature doesn't work in Canada. Even if it just included the ability to set goals without the US version's ability to compare with others, that would be good enough for me.

(Another Canada thing) Add the ability to pull info from the NSLSC (National Student Loan Service Centre) website. This has been mentioned in Mint's forums for years now with not much explanation given why it isn't included. I still have my loan in under a manually entered as a ""property"" that I have to edit every time I make a payment but that should be unnecessary.  
  
Be able to categorize accounts manually: My TFSA account shows up as an ""investment"" account and it won't allow me to change it to a simple savings account.  

edit: ANother big one I just remembered: Being able to manually add loans! As mentioned above, I made my student loan a property because the NSLSC wasn't in their database.

* I have a good job that I plan to keep forever.

* I have about $17k saved up in my checking account.

* I don't have a savings account.

* I have no credit card debt. I only have one credit card.

* I have about $27k student loans debt total, which I'm paying off in minimum monthly payments. (10k in a SallieMae account, $17k in Federal Student loan account).

* 7.50%  of my monthly income is placed into a TRS 401(a) retirement account (mandatory).

* My average net income is about $1.2k/month.

I know nothing about how to handle my finances. Hell, I don't even know how to do my taxes (my dad does it for me). So I have a few questions.

How does a 401(a) work? Is this my best retirement option? Should I be looking into a Roth IRA or a 401k?

- **Cash ISA:** Tax-free savings limited to £5,640 a year. It's pretty easy to get 3% interest on these.
- **Stocks and shares ISA:** Tax-free investments, limited to (£11,280 minus your cash ISA) a year.
- **Savings accounts:** Normal taxed cash savings accounts, 2.5-3% interest.
- **Pensions:** No idea what's normal. I pay into one and my employer contributes more.

Here are a few questions I've got:

I pay £30/month interest on a £24k student loan and have no intention of paying off more than the minimum. Is that sensible?

I fill up a cash ISA every year at over 3%. Everything I earn that I don't spend currently goes in a 3% savings account, so I have an emergency fund and enough for next year's ISA. But that's where I'm stuck… should I follow the advice of [Martin Lewis on Stocks ISAs](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/isa-discounts) and open an account with someone like [Hargreaves Lansdown](http://www.hl.co.uk/) to invest £5k?

THAT CONDITION ONLY APPLIES TO AUTO INSURANCE.**

Secondly, yes local credit unions need the business and may offer better rates. That said...

Background: Currently I'm a Wells Fargo (previously Wachovia) customer who has been unhappy with the change over. In my case, it's the timing of payments when paying bills electronically - they pull the funds two days early. No less than 20 minutes ago my boss contacted Wells Fargo customer service wanting to know why they charged $125 annual fee for his CAP checking account when Wachovia did not. Short answer: they charge for brokerage services that he doesn't use. They refused a refund. The conversation did not go well. 

Pros: No minimum balance. USAA doesn't have branch locations per se (a few) but instead allows you to use a smartphone or scanner to deposit checks to your account [EDIT: Per BeaconSlash's comment below I called to double check and there are qualifications to use the deposit@home feature - you must already have insurance or loan through USAA] or if you want to make a physical deposit you can do so at any UPS store. Their online bill pay is awesome. They will issue physical checks for free (you pay $6 for shipping though). The account is interest bearing on balances above $1000 (not much but still). They allow you to use any ATM at no charge and will refund the reciprocal bank's ATM fees up to ten times a month. No flat service fees. 

Cons: No physical presence for branches. That's it. 

The kicker is their customer service. No other company I've dealt with (except maybe Thinkgeek.com) has the level of customer service these guys have for credit cards, auto insurance, mortgages, or banking. None.

Having not that much in savings (maybe a small emergency fund), I decided to have a portion of my paycheck automatically deposit into my savings account, to guard against firing/job change/zombie-pocalypse.

At first, given that I wasn't going to be making that much more than before, I though maybe $200 a month was all I could afford to bank.  Then, I thought, well maybe $500.  If I lived responsibly, I could probably bank $500 a month.  

When it came time to enter it online, I got impulsive and thought, why not go all out.  I set up to deposit $500 per paycheck ($1000 a month) into my savings account.  I knew I'd need some of that money each month, but I thought I'd try to stretch myself to save as much of it as possible.

Now, after two years, I've been able to pay for all of my trips (2 vacations, 2 X-mas trips home) with cash, buy some larger electronics (iPad, Wii, Flat Screen TV) with cash, and still have $12,000 more in savings than when I started.  

I probably have to transfer some over to checking every other month, but lord knows having to make that extra step have given me pause more than once.  If I had to transfer money INTO savings, I'd probably have less than half of what I have now, but something about it appearing there reminds me that it's where that money belongs.

**tl;dr - Set up automatic deposit into your savings account for more than you think you can handle.  Everything might go better than expected.**

I've learned a ton that no one ever learns about banking because I work at one. They don't teach you what I'm gonna provide in school. They won't teach you at the bank until you fuck up and they have to explain why you were charged a fee. They want your fees. Its how they pay for the 24/7 customer service most big banks receive.

Below I wrote to a different subreddit who asked for this type of information. Hopefully it helps many of you here and saves you a lot of money and peace of mind.

Keep a check register and here is why...

Please, never use the bank website to retrieve your exact available balance. As sad as it sounds write down your transactions as you spend/make them and use the website as a guide to write down what may have been missed.

We live in a very convenient electronic age and we are all very spoiled on our electronics and screens. Unfortunately, these websites can only show you transactions that have been presented to them. Not all of your transactions appear that you make because of the path ways they have to take to get to your bank.

Checks - non electronic items. Do not show up as pending. Checks post to your account the same business day they are deposited. Write down the check in your register, and update your balance, know what you have left to spend so the check clears.

Debit Card - PIN purchase - will post the same business day the transaction is made. Think of PIN as you are making your payment to that merchant right then and there. You are sending your money to them.

Debit Card - Credit - This pathway, when processed, is pulled from your account by the merchant when they consolidate their transactions. This does not come out until the merchant requests it to be paid. Big companies like Walmart process these transactions then your mom and pop shops. These types of transactions cost the merchant money. If you are at a mom and pop shop, use PIN and save them money.

The trick to credit transactions is if the merchant does not submit for payment the pending transaction will be removed by the website after a preset time. The reason it does this is because places like hotels will place a small hold on some funds, then never take the money. Since we dont want them to hold your money forever the bank releases the hold after three business days.

This does not mean they cannot collect. All it does is take it away from your history until either the merchant does collect or it never comes back if they never collect.

^ THIS is what fucks people up. Use PIN as much as possible unless you can't help it. I've seen it happen many times someone makes a ton of transactions, some are removed because the merchant hasn't requested money, so they forget what they have spent and end up spending more than what they have.

Please, don't give money to Overdraft Fees. Just write down as you spend or keep some kind of log on your phone. The website is not your everything. Do not rely on someone else's tools to manage your money. You are in control of your money, know what you have been paid, and know the transactions you are making because you are making them. The website can only show you what it has been given.

Last reason...what if the bank is showing a balance that you have no idea why it would be lower than you thought it was? How do you prove they have incorrect information? A claim can dispute a transaction but if it doesnt go in your favor then what? If you keep a record you can use that information to assist you in a claim against a merchant or dispute incorrect information with your bank.

Why rely on someone elses records when it is YOUR money. Protect it. Teach your kids how to bank. We get the most money off of teenagers to thirty year olds all because they think their website is always 100% accurate.

Although Norway will give me a reasonable pension when I retire, it might be nice to have a little extra.  Private pension accounts are taxed quite heavily here.

Is there a workaround for this issue?  Some sort of legal backdoor that allows me to contribute to an IRA/401k of some kind?  I looked into tax-exempt options like muni bond funds as a go-it-alone alternative, but I don't understand that market so well.

I’ve set a budget, and for the next 9 months, my income will outweigh my expenses by about $5k/month. That’s a lot of extra money to just stuff in a savings account, but to be honest, I’m not sure where to start. What would you do with that extra money?

Some things to consider: After the next 9 months is over, I will most likely not have any form of income for the following 6 months to a year while I travel internationally.  I’d like to have about $20k liquid at the end of 9 months for use during those travels and to get me back on my feet here in the US when I return. The other $25k that I hope to accumulate does not need to be immediately accessible.

Edit: I have NOT made any other retirement savings besides the Roth IRA. So maybe that's where I should start?

1372793906.0,67,self.personalfinance,1himne,PSA: Consider consolidating certain variable interest student loans now to lock in the low rate.,79,12,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1himne/psa_consider_consolidating_certain_variable/,"For Stafford and PLUS loans originated through 6/30/2006, the interest rates are variable and are tied to the rates of certain Treasury instruments.  Treasury yields are very low right now, so the corresponding variable rates are low.  The rates update on July 1, so they just updated for this year.

If you consolidate these loans, the consolidation loan will be fixed rate based on the loans consolidated and rounded up to the next 1/8 percent.  You can then get a discount of 1/4% for direct automatic payments.  What this means is that for variable loans that are now at 2.35%, the consolidation loan could be as  low as 2.125%, which is the lowest possible rate for a consolidation of these loans unless treasury yields go negative.  So, if you have any 2.35% loans, it may be good to consolidate now (unless you are going back to school and could get them consolidated at an even lower rate of 1.5%).

If you have loans at 3.15% or 3.39%, it's possible that you could get one more 1/8% off of the consolidation loan if Treasury yields drop more next year, but they could go up as well.  In any case, the rates are pretty close to the lowest possible without Treasury yields going negative, so it's probably a good time to consolidate and lock in the low rates.

See [here](http://www.finaid.org/loans/scripts/interest.cgi) for more info on how the variable rates are calculated, [here](http://loanconsolidation.ed.gov/help/rate.html) for how to calculate the consolidation loan rate, and [here](https://loanconsolidation.ed.gov/loancalc/servlet/Controller?controller_task=startCalculator) for a consolidation loan calculator.

**Edit:** [Here's](https://loanconsolidation.ed.gov/AppEntry/apply-online/appindex.jsp) the page to start working on your consolidation loan.

**Edit 2:** Since a lot of people are asking, this applies only to Stafford and PLUS loans originated on or before June 30, 2006.  If your loan was originated on or after July 1, 2006, this does not apply.  Also, private loans may have variable rates but are not eligible for federal consolidation.  It's really going to depend on your loan terms and what refinance/consolidation offerings private companies have to determine whether it would be worth if for private loans.

Given that the cutoff date for origination of these loans is 2006, most folks with these loans will be close to paying them off unless they had a long period of deferment, forbearance, or nonpayment or had them on an extended payment plan.  I don't want anybody to think that they'll be able to get their 6.8% loans down to 2.125%, but for people with these loans that won't pay them off by next July (when rates change again), consolidation may be a good option to lock in low rates.",,False,,t5_2qstm,1372876088.0,,,True,t3_1himne,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1himne/psa_consider_consolidating_certain_variable/,

I have $27K in debt.  $3000 in CC debt, $17.5K on student loans, and $9500 on a car that is worth maybe half of that.

I have $19K in a 403(b) from a previous employer that's just sitting around.

I am due to inherit a small amount from a dead grandparent, maybe about $15K or so in the next few months.

I have submitted an application to work in the field with Doctors Without Borders/MSF, and if they choo-choo-choose me, I'll leave the country (hopefully) within the next six months.

I am inclined to liquidate the 403(b) and use it and the inheritance to pay off all debts I owe.  That way, when I leave, I will leave zero debt and zero obligations behind, and can simply focus solely on my work overseas.

I turned 20 in October. I have a job that I absolutely despise earning $10/hr doing things that are legal, but incredibly unethical and just morally disturbing to me. I seriously feel queasy every time I clock in.

I work 25 hours a week and currently have $80 to my name.

My monthly expenses are as follows:

$250 for rent

$140 for car insurance

$200 for gas

$100 for food

$110-$180 for my phone


I currently owe $300 on my car insurance which will likely be cancelled if I don't pay and $300 on my phone which will likely be cancelled if I don't pay.

The reason I owe on those accounts is not because of *pure* irresponsibility, but rather because I was forced to relocate away from the family I had grown up with for years and live instead with my biological father whom I had had no interaction with in the past ten years. As it turns out, his wife was complete crazy and wound up kicking me out of the house for not talking to her enough. I was not given any kind of notice and hadn't taken the necessary precautions to be prepared for that sort of situation. I fell behind in bill-paying as a result of space-seeking and depression. This was at the beginning of fall term and I had to drop out as a result, thankfully without responsibility for the grades.


Here is what I want:

1. University.
2. Happiness.

I have neither right now. I have no idea what sort of financial situation I'll be in once I try to register for winter term in six days and frankly I don't care. I just need a way out of this community college and into a nearby University, where I *actually* have a support system, can earn enough money to pay all of my bills, and can be happy for once..



I don't know what to do. This is a ramble of a post but I think it adequately conveys how lost I am. I don't even know where to begin. I've never felt like giving up before in my life but it's frustrating as fuck to me that I have so much ambition to start businesses and non-profits and help this person and help that person and yet I have a family and friend system that basically says, ""Fuck you, just drop out of college and go work at McDonald's.""

I am very fortunate to have about $50,000 in savings.  About 5 years ago, I invested half in the market in very well balanced mutual funds and put the other half in 1-5 year CD ladders.  At the time, 5 year CDs on ING were getting almost 5% interest.  As they are maturing, I just can't take myself to renew at under 1%.  Although I am in my early 30s and common wisdom is to invest aggressively in the market, I just don't trust its stability and have a very strong fear of a catastrophic collapse within my lifetime.  Or at the very least, stagnation for decades to come.  Since interests rates are currently crazy low to encourage borrowing and spending in this slow economy, I feel like CDs and savings accounts are not an effective place to grow savings either.  Does anyone have a suggestion for a fairly secure place to keep my money where it can grow at least a little?  I realize it would have less potential return than the market and I’m fine with that, I’m willing to trade it for the peace of mind.  Thanks in advance!

EDIT:  A bit of confusion below.  Why I don't want half in the market is pretty irrelevant, shouldn't have gone into it.  Revised question could be - Was happy with CD ladder returns but interests dropped dramatically.  Any suggestions for a safe place with higher-than-current-CD returns?

1332811113.0,67,self.personalfinance,rf4zq,"I decided to look up how we are doing as a company today, and interestingly enough there seem to be a few misconceptions about credit repair.",81,14,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/rf4zq/i_decided_to_look_up_how_we_are_doing_as_a/,"First off, I'd like to let you know that there will obviously be some bias here since I work for Lexington Law.  I'm a college student that found a job there, and have worked there since I obtained my Associates from the University of Utah.

Out of curiosity, I've searched this subreddit and I keep seeing posts that cast any sort of company that does credit repair into a pile of garbage.  ""Don't do this, it is a scam"" or ""You can do it yourself for free"" or ""There are so many horror stories out there of people being scammed"".  To be honest, these concerns are absolutely valid.

Credit repair has a really shaky past.  Instead of legitimately helping people take control of their score, companies in the past have used EIN numbers to try and get a clean slate of credit.  They've promised amazing results overnight.  They've charged fees upfront and then ran off with the money.  With so many scams that have been out there in the past, it leads people to believe that there is no legal way to repair credit.  It also makes people think that anyone who offers to help you do so is there to steal from you.  In 2006, there was 'Project Credit Despair' http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2006/02/badcreditbgone.shtm which tackled 20 agencies and shut them down.  In 2008, there was 'Operation Clean Sweep', which took down 36 additional credit repair organizations.

This isn't to say that scams no longer exist, but it just illustrates the amount of skepticism about the legitimacy of the industry that I operate in is understandable.  People want to make responsible financial decisions and are protective with their money.

To give you some perspective, let me tell you what I do.  I speak to people every day who were just recently denied for homes, cars, and loans.  These people are generally surprised that they were denied for credit.  They've found the house that they've always wanted, and just had their dreams crushed by a denial.  I discuss with these people why they were denied, and I pull up a credit report with them to discuss their options.  On every call that I take, I clearly disclose that they have the right to do everything that we do for them on their own.  They are told of their legal right to challenge items on their credit reports that they feel are questionable or misleading.

However, for someone that either has no idea how credit works and what goes into credit scores, it can be really difficult to figure out how to do it.  Instead of leaving someone absolutely helpless and just telling them to pull up their reports for free through annualcreditreport.com and dispute the information by looking up form letters online, we end up doing that process for them if they want us to.

The majority of people that sign up for any credit repair service with us are people who either do not want to spend the time doing it on their own, or have no idea how to do it on their own.  They don't dispute items with credit bureaus or legally intervene with their creditors every day for their job.  They don't know that they need to send everything certified mail.  They don't know how to respond and change tactics to deal with some stubborn collection agency that refuses to uphold their rights as a consumer.

Anyone can do it on their own.  Anyone can dispute information on their own.  Anyone can challenge negative listings with their creditors on their own.  Anyone can try and remove inquiries on their own.  Anyone can drive down to the post office and certify every piece of mail that they send to the bureaus or creditors.  

You can also change the oil in your car on your own.  You can build your own computer.  You can fix a leaky faucet by yourself.  You can set up a new 5.1 surround stereo for your brand new HDTV by yourself.  For people who have no idea how to do those things, they either hire someone to do it for them, or they look up how to do it on their own.

Doing things on your own that you don't do every day can be tricky.  If you do things on your own, that's great, it is a good way to save money.  If you don't feel comfortable with doing something on your own, don't feel less capable as a person for hiring someone out.

Telling someone that something isn't a good idea because they can do it on their own is just bad logic.  Your subject to your opinion, but giving advice to someone should be more well thought out instead of saying ""google it"" or ""it is a scam"" or ""check the FTC"".  

This isn't an ad.  I'm not leaving you with my phone number to contact me, or with testimonials to try to convince you to do something that you can do on your own.  That isn't the point of this.  I just want this subreddit to be aware that there are perfectly valid reasons for rebuilding credit on your own, and perfectly valid reasons for hiring someone to help you do so.

Last ",80,10,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/knxl5/iama_lending_club_investor_earning_1172_on_my/,"Someone asked me to do this, so I thought I'd just post it here since you guys might find it more interesting.

Right now I'm earning a weight average of 11.72%.  I suspect it to be more around 14%.  The 11.72% takes into account I have close to 1/4th all my Lending Club money sitting in cash earning 0%

If you don't know about [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/), it's basically peer to peer lending.  The bank is just the middle man taking a cut of the loan percentage for doing all the leg work.  

Lending club has a fairly good review process.  Something around only 1/3rd of loans make it to the funding stage.  When the loan makes it to the funding stage.  It's up to the lendors to fund the loan.  Even if the loan gets 100% funded, Lending Club reviews the loan again.  I've had many loans become 100% funded and then rejected.

Lending Club will also assign a risk to the loans.  A through G.   A's have low interest rate, with a lower risk of defaulting.  G's are the more risky, but can offer greater than 20% a year return.  In each letter, there is also another grade of 1-5.  A1 being the safest and a G5 being the most risky.

They provide all the statistics for basically anything you would be interested in, such as 3% of all loans default.  I think A's have a history of around a 1% default, each letter progressivly get's riskier and G's are around 13% default rate.   See the stats [https://www.lendingclub.com/info/demand-and-credit-profile.action](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/demand-and-credit-profile.action)

As a lender, you invest in the loan by buying notes.  The minimum note you can buy on a loan is $25.  You are also given the option to let the system automatically decide which loans to invest in by selecting your risk preference or you can choose the loans yourself.

If you choose to browse the loans, you can filter the data however you like.  View by risk, amount, credit score, etc...   You basically look over the application and can even ask the borrower questions.  

I have fairly strict guidelines into what I invest.  I do a lot of debt consolidation.  I look for long history of credit, how long they've been at the same company, if they bothered to write a description of why they needed the loan, etc...   I also tend to only invest in loans around $5,000 and I only invest $25 in each loan.  Occasionally $50 if it looks really good.

Below is how I have my investments diversified.
[http://i.imgur.com/Cuw8x.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Cuw8x.jpg)

As I'm writing this there are 630 loans to chose from, I'd say that I can usually only find 5-6 loans that meet my criteria every day.  So that means I've been stretching my investment out for a while.  I moved $5,000 over a few months ago and I still have $1700 left to invest.

When I first started investing a year ago, I played around with $2,000.  I bought notes that met my same criteria and tried to recoup my money through their trading platform two months later.  I believe it took just under a month to sell all the notes and get my money back.

Lending club seems to be offering good returns for me.  I'm by no means an expert at this and I could possibly even be picking the crappiest loans.  Who knows?  But so far, I've had no defaults and possibly good luck.

Anyways, hopefully a few of you will find this useful.  If you have any questions just ask.  If you are thinking about trying it out, PM me and I will send you an invite.  The current promotion is both you and I will get a free $200 to invest if you start out with at least $5000.

It's been almost 6 months since I came into the money and everything is still not finalized. I've only recently gained access to the various money market accounts (this was my fault, dragging my heels) an still need to sell off a fair amount of property and a house (expect to fetch about $250K-$350K in total). The total windfall should be about $2 million, though I will need to pay estate taxes in a few months.

Between costs associated with handling the estate, taxes and the like, I expect to have about $1.75 million to use.

To date, no one other than my lawyers know the extent of the windfall. People are aware that I came into money (they're mostly considering the profit I will make from the sale of the house, which did not have a mortgage), but no one knows the full amount.

Over the last 5-6 months, I've paid off any debt I had, took a small trip (my first vacation in probably 6 years) and made some small purchases. In total I've spent approximately $10,000 of the total amount.

Although this was meant as an update, I do have a few questions for everyone here.

* First, a large percentage (probably ~&amp;750K) is in money market accounts with Wells Fargo. It seems that people on here don't think much of WF, so any suggestions?

* I currently rent, and have almost a full year left on my lease. I'm not 100% sure I want to stay in my area for any length of time, but should I invest a portion of the money in a home? If so, how should I go about figuring out what I should spend on property? If I purchase a $250K house and have the ability to pay for it in full, should I do so ( I would assume not)? **Edit:** I should note that my credit score isn't the greatest. I would imagine getting a loan and making on-time payments over a lengthy period would go a long way in fixing that?

* Lastly, while I do enjoy my current job, I'm considering potentially making a slight career shift and either doing some additional training (this would be related to programming/web design) or taking a pay cut to get experience working in an industry I may prefer - working for start ups is appealing to me and something I've done in the past. Does anyone have any thoughts on this.

Because of this, I've recognized that I have a few months where I'm going to have cash flow issues while things get organized.

I'm looking for an iOS or Mac app that will help me keep an eye on that. Something where I can key in pay days and expenses, and it will calculate remaining cash on a day by day basis, and alert me to any issues ahead of time so I can move things around would be ideal. For various reasons, setting up a spreadsheet is not ideal, and I'd like to be able to easily share it with my wife. 

The closest thing I've seen was the software that PNC Bank uses, but there's no PNC near us any more. We started learning You Need a Budget for our other budgeting concerns, but it just doesn't address our immediate needs, like making sure that paying Monday's bills doesn't screw us out of the cash for Wednesday's.

**Edit/Update:** To make it easier for others, here are the programs that look most promising:

* [PocketSmith](http://www.pocketsmith.com) - This one looks absolutely great. It's exactly what I was looking for, and it's straight forward and clear enough to not cause any confusion. It looks like there is a mobile app as well. One downside is the cost, which is a subscription fee paid monthly or quarterly. 

* [GNUCash](http://www.gnucash.org) - This seems to have more of a true business accounting feel, but it does focus on cash transactions. I worry a bit about ease of use, though I haven't even had time to download and try it yet. On the upside, it's completely free.

* [Balance Forecasting](https://www.balanceforecastingapp.me) - This was an early contended, but dropped behind thanks to the above. While there doesn't seem to be anything outright wrong with the software, it just didn't seem to be on par. Also, the website feels like it was cobbled together on a Thursday night, and since it's a web-only interface that's going to get my financial data, that made me a bit wary.

I'm 25 years old. I live in the USA and have a full time job and my financials are secure. I'm a Chinese citizen and have a green card (permanent resident) for US. I've been here for 10+ years. 

My grandparents recently passed away, they 'owned' a fairly large condo/apartment (unit, not the building) as they were relatively high ranking in the military in China. I put quotes around 'owned' because I don't think you can truly own real estate property in China, it's more like a indefinite lease from the government or something, but I believe for all practical purposes it's the same.  Anyways, my grandparents put my mom and one of her sisters in their will to inherit this property (they have other siblings, but only my mom and this aunt had a good relationship with my grandparents). 

Apparently the title is still under my dead grandma's name (or maybe her estate? I don't know) because they can't put both their names on the title, has to be a single person or something.  Anyways, my aunt doesn't have children, and I'm an only child, they wanted to put the title under my name instead of one of them. Their reasoning is that in case they pass away, they don't want their other siblings trying to take the property or something instead of me getting it. They also said because the property is ""provisioned out"" by the military (I'm not sure how exactly it works, but you can't just buy property straight up with money in China, at least for housing anyway, my grand parents were provisioned the right to purchase certain properties up to a certain size/location because of their military ranking or something). Anyways they say the rules are not favored for skip generation (my grandparents -&gt; me), so if they put my mom's name on the title, I might not necessarily get the house when she passes away because the military/government would try to take it back or something. 

Anyways, the point is, if I do this, I'll technically own a rather valuable property in China (It's a fairly big apartment close to downtown Beijing at a good location, they say it's probably worth ~$1million USD in the current market). It's already fully paid for, there's no mortgage, and apparently at least right now there are no taxes/fees that are required at all for owning it in China. My aunt will continue to live in the apartment, and me and my parents obviously whenever we visit china. Even if there are fees/costs coming up, my aunt and parents will handle it. I do trust them on that part, and they trust me to not turn around and kick my aunt out of the house and sell it. Both my parents and I live in the US and have no intention of going back to live in China. So basically I can pretend I don't have it until my Aunt passes away and then if the situation doesn't changes (aka my parents are still retiring and living comfortably in US and don't plan on moving back to China) and then I'll probably sell it. 

So, what do I need to worry about? Are there risks? I do trust my aunt and my parents completely. There's definitely no bad/hidden intentions here. They want to legally guarantee that I will own this condo when they pass away, and give me all the legal tools necessary should other members of my extended family tries to take it.

Will this affect anything at all for me, like dealing with taxes or anything like that? I'm not going to screw them over, so I just need go and sign the paperwork next time I head back to China and I'm not sure there is any downside I need to worry about.

1343915982.0,61,self.personalfinance,xk9sl,FYI: Google Wallet works with any US credit card. but there's so many catches it's not worth using.,99,38,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/xk9sl/fyi_google_wallet_works_with_any_us_credit_card/,"So Google Wallet works on any US credit/debit card. What's the catch?

They couldn't get US issuers on board except Citi on some cards (as they had at launch) - so everything is proxied through a ""virtual mastercard"" and your credit cards are stored in Google's cloud. The merchant charges Google, and Google charges the same amount to your credit/debit card.

Well, what's the catch?

* Contactless payments have extremely high interchange (cost to merchant). You don't pay it directly, but the merchant does. Now if the benefits exceed the cost (speed of transaction, amount people spend, number of people shopping) then great - but it's higher than many interchange rates, so what's the value proposition?

* ~~Many issuers lack the contactless terminals anyways, resulting in swiping a regular card.~~ **EDIT 2**: I've decided to strike this point since it isn't a point against using Google Wallet when it isn't available. That's a fair point made by some folks in the comments.

* Since Google proxies the transactions. This means it shows up as GOOGLE * MERCHANT NAME and under Google's merchant code (haven't tested in person, but [Google's article on it](http://support.google.com/wallet/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;topic=1349429&amp;answer=2688794) confirms it). Since it shows up as Google - and more importantly, under Google's merchant code - you're going to get the base cashback rate. If you get 5 points per dollar at restaurants, or 5% cashback on gas, or 3% at groceries - you're not going to get it if the transaction goes through Google Wallet.

* Since Google proxies the transactions, it'll show up as a ton of charges from the same merchant on your credit card. This may trigger fraud detection - purchases on the play store are regularly declined on one of my cards because it's a personal card and Google charges under an advertising services merchant code. So you may end up digging out the wallet anyways.

* This is if you have a phone with NFC that supports wallet. If you have to root the phone, it'll say unsupported device - because the PIN to unlock the wallet is not secured in the secure element and depends on file permissions. Therefore, any app with root access can access the PIN and unlock Wallet. 

Overall, it's looking like the time for NFC payments is not yet and Wallet is still kind of dead. ISIS looks more promising, even though the fees on issuers are insane, if merely because they're going to put NFC in the SIM card and therefore will be able to get it en masse into phones.

**EDIT**: Forgot to mention it's capped to $1,000/device/day and $10,00/all devices/day.

From what I understand, the best way to buy a house is to either be a first time homebuyer or to put down 20%. To put down 20% will take 5-7 years of saving because the median home in Hawaii is over 500k. I am not sure if I can live at home for that long, and I feel like renting is wasting money.

First of all, thank you all for the awesome advice, and exposing a lot of my options.  It's given me a lot of hope, and although I am still a bit anxious and stressed out, I have decided to take responsibility and man up on the situation I have caused myself.

Next, I'd like to give an overview of what I've done since the last post:  

* I spoke with a bankruptcy attorney (I only had time for 1 consultation due to work).  I was advised that I would qualify for Chapter 13 (possibly Chapter 7), although he did not look into the details of my finances during this consultation.  He suggested that bankruptcy is a protection provided by the law for people like me, and that I should take advantage of this.

* I spoke with a credit counselor (a member of NFCC), and was advised that I qualify for a DMP (Debt Management Program).  I'd be making ~$1900 monthly payments, and would be able to get interest rates on all of the qualifying credit cards/loans reduced, as well be able to pay off my debts completely in 47 months.

* I am still current on all my bills, due to recognizing my situation (barely in time), and cutting living expenses as much as I could.

Finally, I'd like to propose what I plan as next steps in improving my situation, and would love to hear your feedback.

I am going with Option #2 (DMP), and with this, my updated income/expenses would look like this.  (My income has changed due to overtime/on-call hours, and this should be the minimum for the next 2 months at least):

Income (Post-Tax): ~~$5400~~  $6300 (August/September)  
Supplemental Income (Roommates): $900  
**Total Income: $7200**  

Mortgage: $1560 @ 3.75% (includes Homeowners Insurance/Taxes)  
(Current value: ~$315,000, Loan Balance: ~$260,000)  
Water: $100  
Electricity: $350 (summertime, otherwise, around $150)  
Gas: $25  
HOA: $75  
**Total Housing Expenses: $2,110**  

Fuel: $200  
Food: $300  
Cell Phone: $80  
Gym: $50  
**Total Living Expenses: $630**  

Motorcycle Insurance: $110  
Auto Insurance: $100  
**Total Insurance Expenses: $220**  

*Note:  the strikethrough loans are the ones that qualify for my DMP, they are not paid off, just reconsolidated*
Motorcycle Loan: $190 @ 0% (Loan Balance: ~$9000, bike has some damage now, has a value of probably ~$7,000)  
Auto Title Loan: $345 @ 10% (120.3% APR) (Loan Balance: ~$3500)  
~~Payday Loan #1: $750 @ 89.68% APR (Loan Balance: ~$10000)~~  
Payday Loan #2: $120 @ 204% APR (Loan Balance: ~$750)  
Payday Loan #3: $300 @ 390% APR (Loan Balance: ~$830)  
Payday Loan #4: $550 @ 30% (Loan Balance: ~$1125)  
~~Credit Card #1: $75 @ 16.99% (Balance: ~$5600)~~  
~~Credit Card #2: $40 @ 19.24% (Balance: ~$2800)~~  
~~Credit Card #3: $370 @ 21.99% (Balance: ~$14800)~~  
~~Credit Card #4: $35 @ 16.74% (Balance: ~$950)~~  
~~Credit Card #5: $170 @ 16.24% (Balance: ~$6850)~~  
~~Credit Card #6: $171 @ 21.99% (Balance: ~$6200)~~  
~~Personal Loan #1: $280 @ 17.99% (Balance: ~$6300)~~  
~~Personal Loan #2: $320 @ 14.27% (Balance: ~$10100)~~  
Student Loan: $300 @ 4% (Balance: ~$51,200)  
DMP: $1900 (Balance: sum of the strikeout, but ~$90000;  will update this once I start the program)  
**Total Loan Expenses: ~~$4016~~ $3705**  
***
**Total Income: $7200**  
**Total Expenses: $6665**  

Now, I do realize (and was told by the counselor) that the DMP is only giving me ~$300 savings in terms of cash flow, and said he could not do anything with the online payday loans as they have no relationship with those lenders.  However, the interest rate on Payday Loan #1 would be reduced to ~12%, while the other cards would be dropped to ~6%-10%.  

My payday loan balances are only dropping slightly with the minimum payments (as expected), but I believe I can knock out 1 loan a month for the next 3 months.  

If I make it through the beginning of January, I will be able to have a better cash flow, with end of the year bonuses kicking in, as well as RSUs in my company vesting in May 2014.  

Right now, I'm in ""emergency mode"", and saving every penny I can, while looking at the bigger picture (future) with hope that things will be getting better if I can just suck it up in the short term.  (I am also looking at other subreddits that were suggested to try to bring in extra income/do consulting/and have successfully used ""comps"" at the casinos where I stopped gambling.  Furthermore, I am still receiving promotional mailers that I've used to walk in, get free cash (~$120 a month), and walk out.  I also have a lot of food comps, so I am using those as well...  

Given that, if for some reason the creditors cannot agree to the DMP proposed, and/or my income is not as expected, and/or some other emergency expense comes up (car repair, health expense not covered by insurance, roommate leaves), I believe my only option will be to file for bankruptcy.

If requested, I will update my progress (less verbose, but with a summary of income/loan balances).  I'd create a blog for this, but am not sure if I would be able to remain anonymous.  (One of the unfortunate implications of this is the stigma from my social circles if they were to find out my own stupidity/addictions got me into a financial mess...  They are already noticing that I have avoided going out with them for a while now...)

The article includes:

&gt;They concluded that 62.1 percent of the bankruptcies were medically related because the individuals either had more than $5,000 (or 10 percent of their pretax income) in medical bills, mortgaged their home to pay for medical bills, or *lost significant income due to an illness*.

So if you get sick and insurance pays 100% of your medical bills, but since you can't work, you're forced to declare bankruptcy, it's considered medically related.

I don't want to discuss politics here, but more about an individual's 'safety net' that they prepare for themselves. What does PF think about long term disability insurance? Personally, I think Long Term Disability Insurance is one of the most overlooked form of insurance out there. 

* By the time you reach age 30, you’re more likely to be disabled than to die before you reach age 60. 
* 70% of the private sector workforce (folks who don’t work for the government) have no long-term disability insurance.
* One in seven workers can expect to be disabled for five years or more before retirement.
* The average long-term disability absence lasts 2.5 years.
Loss of income due to disability was a major factor in 50% of all mortgage foreclosures.
* Only 38% of the 2.3 million workers who applied for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits in 2008 were approved.
* For those approved, the average monthly SSDI benefit was $1,064.
* Only 10% of disabling accidents or illnesses are work related—Workers’ Compensation doesn’t cover the remaining 90%.

If you save up an emergency fund that will cover 6 months of living expenses, and buy long term disability insurance, the emergency fund will last you until the LTD kicks in. It costs me $25/month for a long term policy (according to a quote I just got). I feel like it's a wise choice and it's rarely talked about.

I had to buy a car about 6 months ago because my husband joined the military and I needed a car to drive cross country in. Our old car was barely starting. We researched cars and found a few we liked. I found a car on a dealership's website and went to test drive it. I researched how to negotiate a car and felt somewhat confident (my parents bought my previous car so I had no experience buying). I followed advice to secure a loan through my bank, USAA. Well I loved the car so he sat me down to talk numbers. They said it was going to be very difficult to use the loan through usaa, but that they could offer the same terms through Toyota Financial.  I thought that was weird, but went along with it.

He had promised a lot of things during the test drive because the car was used and needed a few small cosmetic things. Well I was trying to negotiate a better price and the sales manager came out. He said the guy never would have promised me any of those fixes calling me a liar. I can be timid and I was exhausted at this point. We went back and forth for awhile, and finally I was sent to the finance department.

By this point they had berated me and I felt like crying and going home (I should have). Apparently the finance people try to sell you things too. I ended up with a $500 car alarm. I thought I looked over the paperwork carefully, but once I got home I realized they had charged me over $1,200 in finance charges. I can't believe they pulled that on me. I should have just stuck to my guns and used my usaa financing. I ended up paying about $12000 for a car that was worth maybe $8500.  

I feel like such an idiot. We work hard for our money (I'm a special education teacher) and I can't believe I just threw it all away. I had heard car salesmen can be sharks, but I didn't know it could be this bad. I feel sick to my stomach every month when I make a car payment.  Hopefully someone can learn something from my mistake.

Oh, and my husband and I both have good credit with scores over 750 so that makes me feel even worse about our crappy financing deal.

EDIT: Kirben pointed out that it wasn't a fee they charged me.  It was the amount of interest I will pay over the life of the loan.

Out of curiosity, how much higher could I possibly get my score?",92,29,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/176q4i/my_fico_score_is_814812811_i_dont_own_a_home_out/,"So the first question is A) **how can I get my FICO score higher in my current situation** and B) **is there any benefit to getting my FICO score higher at this point** (i.e. easier to get the best rates).

So here's the background...

 * According to Experian, my FICO score is 814.  Equifax is 812 and TransUnion is 811.  
 * The first item is my *""report doesn't show any usable/valid real estate loans, such as a mortgage""*.  I live in Boston, and the kind of a home I want is extraordinarily expensive (I want a home I love, not just a home).  I still rent, but am still saving aggressively towards a home (probably would put 40-50% down, so it's taking a very long time to save this).  So I can't address this any time soon.  
 * The second item is *""your report shows that the available credit across your open, recently reported revolving accounts, such as credit cards, is too low""*.  Recently I had three credit cards opened in 2002, 2003 and 2005.  The total available credit across them was ~$15,000.    I've since looked at how I could save more money via rewards programs and opened an AMEX Blue Cash Preferred which has a $15,000 limit itself, raising my total available credit to $30K.  
 * The third item is *""your report shows that the time since your oldest revolving account, such as a credit card, was opened is too short""*.  I had a Capital One card that I had opened in 2000, but during the financial crisis Capital One decided to close it on me for whatever reason.  I protested it, but I think it was to limit their potential exposure, even though at the time I think my FICO score was in the 750-760 range.  I told them that I wished their children died in a car fire.
 * The fourth item is *""your report shows that the ratio of balances-to-credit-limits across your open revolving accounts, such as a credit card. is too high""*.  This has been addressed, as everything is paid off.  Historically I would run expensive purchases through an Amazon card for points, then make a balance transfer (at 1% of the balance, which negated the 1% rewards) to another card to have it at 0% for the year, so I could pay it off over the year to keep cash flow smooth. Got no rewards in the end, but eliminated the interest.  Now all balances are $0 (or have a slight credit). I run everything through the AMEX for the rewards (6% for supermarket/prescriptions, 1-3% for everything else) and pay off the balance **weekly**.  I have some expensive purchases planned (still furnishing), but I plan to just use the card and pay 50% of the balance a week after the charge hits the card so keep the ratio low (I have 0% APR for another 11 months).  

No late payments ever.  No outstanding loans.  Curious if 820ish (""Super Prime""? I think I'm still ""Prime Plus"") is as high as it can get without a home a lender could try to take from me in the event of a problem, or if not, how much closer to 850 I could get.",,False,,t5_2qstm,1359031803.0,,,True,t3_176q4i,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/176q4i/my_fico_score_is_814812811_i_dont_own_a_home_out/,

Dad took early retirement in 2007, started his own business in small town Pennsylvania. Things went down the tubes in 2008, and ever since then things have been not so good for my folks.

Nowadays he still tries to plug away at the business and make it work, as any jobs that he's tried to get in his area aren't available to someone his age (late 50s). My mom babysits for neighbors. Honestly, I don't think they can make much more money than they're making already: my dad's too old to get any decent jobs back in corporate America, my mom's got too many health issues to physically function at a 9-5 retail job.

I love my parents, and I couldn't live knowing that their house was forclosed on or that they didn't go to a doctor for a serious problem simply because of medical costs. Yet, that's kinda where it's at.


The nitty-gritty details of my parents' finances, per month:

* Combined average income: $1200

* Money I give them: $1500

* Mortgage: -$1300

* Bare necessities cost of living (food, gas, water, electric, etc.): -$1000

* City Card min. payment (18% interest rate): -$150

* Chase min. payment (16.2% interest rate): -$225

* Bank of A. min. payment (9.9% interest rate): -$385

* Add that all up together and you get -$270. Lovely.

* Also, they have no health insurance. 

Ok, now for a little background on me:

I'm newly married, and basically my wife's fine with me helping out my parents as much as I want, as long as I pay my end of the bills and rent. She's able to save about $20,000 a year with her job, and currently she reports that she's saved $30,000 over the past couple years, so I figured that we have a good emergency fund. Also, she gets to save a substantial amount, so that makes her happy and it gives me a little comfort to know that we've got it in case everything goes to shit.

I worked out our budget for 2013, and this is what it's looking like for me:

* I have no debt.

* I can continue to give my parents $1500 a month.

* On top of that, I will have $5000 to start a Roth IRA, which is something I've been wanting for a while.

* On top of that, if I keep to my budget and live semi-frugally, I will have a solid $15,000 leftover to do what I will. My wife had said maybe we should combine it with her savings, but I think she'd be fine if I used some or all of it on my parents too.


So before I get to options, let me make a few things clear: 

1. I trust my parents. They're not gambling, they don't drink or do drugs, they're not financially irresponsible. They just took a gamble on a business, then the economy went bust. As for the $200k house, possibly a bad move, but again, they couldn't have predicted 2008.

2. My parents are very good at being frugal. They don't buy anything extravagant. They don't eat out. My mom cooks cheap, healthy food. Basically, I'm not looking to nitpick their finances.

3. The house is a tough one. They've got $148k left on it. The house has depreciated so much in value that me and my dad both think that if it sold right now, they'd have to end up paying $20k or so just to make up for the loss. They've tried to refinance, but because my dad's income is too low they won't let him refinance, which sucks, because we both thought he could get the payments down to $900ish.

4. They don't have health insurance, and they're not old enough for social security yet. They've tried to find state sponsored health care, but for some odd reason they can't get it.

5. Like I said before, I can't live knowing that they're not able to afford glasses or that they get foreclosure letters. So, for the past year and a half I've been supplementing their income, and will continue to do so until they get back on their feet. I'm in this for the long run, so that means our finances our linked, basically.


Ok, options I've thought of:

* Pay off the high interest credit cards, stat. Just a matter of me getting some 0% balance transfer offers from my credit cards (I've got like $35k credit limit, so once I get a transfer offer I'll probably knock off the City Card and Chase card).

* Ditch the house. Not sure that it's a good idea, seeing as how it could cost a lot to sell and move, and anyplace they move into would still be at least $600 a month.

* I've thought about just using the Roth IRA money to help pay off credit debt. I mean, this is the first year I've had any money to put towards a Roth (I'm 30 years old), so I figure why not just wait 1 more year. If our finances our linked (as in, I'm always going to be helping them out if they need it), then doesn't it make sense to treat their credit card debt as if it were mine, since I'll end up paying it one way or another eventually? Also, my wife's got some savings going on, so me waiting one more year won't make a big difference in the grand scheme of our savings.

* I live outside the US, but is it possible for me to combine my income with my dad's so that he can get the house refinanced? I have no clue, but it's something that just popped into my mind while I was writing this.

* Bankruptcy? I have no clue what it would entail. My dad has an accountant, so I guess he could discuss it with her. Either way, it's an option I guess.

* My mom had to go to the emergency room this past summer, and the hospital reduced her bill from $18,000 to $9,000. They would've just cleared it all, but they looked at my dad's bank account and saw that I'd given him $30k over the past couple years and they said it counted as income. Should I just buy them costco gift cards and stuff like that as a way to supplement their income in case this ever happens again?

* I could try and get a personal loan from one of the banks around where I live for hopefully 6.6 percent or so. If I can get it, how much should I get it for? Just enough to cover all the credit card debt?

Here are the debt totals:

mortgage $148,000, 6.5% fixed, 25 years left

City Card $8,500, 18% ($150 min. payment)

Chase $9,500, 16.2% ($225 min. payment)

Bank of America $20,900, 9.9% ($385 min. payment)

Hospital, $9,600,  0% ($350 for 36 months, but they're trying to still work this out to see if they can get it reduced)

First and foremost please don't need any judgement please. I'm just trying to get a bit of information to make sure I'm going in the right direction.

**background story**
I was in the Army for 5 years stationed over in Seoul, S. Korea in '06 for 3.5 yrs. I saved up a bit of money in TSP around 7k. I got 3 credit cards that I was paying off each month. I was doing very well building my credit. I had an additional 5k saved which I used to put down on a house back home. I then started renting the house for the amount of the mortgage while I was still in Korea. While in Korea I got a girlfriend who I started spending my money on and things got a bit out of hand. I started paying the minimum payments on those cards. I was then stationed in Kansas in '09 and had my girlfriend from Korea that I thought was going to come stay and we were gonna get married. That didn't work out and I was left holding all these bags. I spent around 10k on credit getting furniture and setting up an apartment for ""us"" and then she pretty much just left and went back to Korea. I was paying my debt for about 6 months when I just sank. The amount of money I was making wasn't enough to live on and pay my bills. I left the Army in 2010 (which I realize was not smart and my own damn fault).

I then went and started school in '11 and the military was paying for it through my GI bill, I was also receiving a monthly stipend for living expenses. It was around $1500 per month which was fine for me to scrape by but I couldn't pay any of my debts that were incurred. The debts started going into collections and I just said ""fuck it"" and threw my hands in the air and decided I wasn't going to pay any of them at all ever.

During the time I was in school I was motivated in the beginning...then about 6 months after I just got depressed. I have no clue what led to it but I just picked up my little bit of shit and left. Didn't withdraw or anything, I just went back home and stayed with my parents for a few months. I got a job that was paying around 2k per month, I got an apartment, and a roommate and we tried to do some small business stuff on the side that did not work well. I didn't pay any debts during this time ('11 - '12). I had a girlfriend as well that I kept totally out of the loop. All the while the school was charging me money that I didn't know about for not withdrawing before I left. During this time I racked up about 10k in tuition to the school before I finally was contacted about it. I immediately told them I obviously wasn't coming back and to withdraw me because I didn't want any more charges. The school didn't contact me to pay until later.

1. Can the school really charge me like that? If I didn't attend any class and I was obviously not attending any...they can just keep tacking on the tuition because my name was on the roster? (The school was FullSail in FL)

So this is the beginning of '12 and I decided to make a change. My girlfriend and I decided to move back to her hometown and start trying to save and get our finances in order. Well really she wanted to go back home and I wanted to get MY finances in order. So we did. I withdrew my 7k from the TSP that I saved and used that to move. I got a job and didn't save shit. We spent everything on getting our apartment somewhat furnished. After about 6 mos I quit the job, that I was making around $1,800 /mo at, and decided I'd go back to school. So going back to school I started getting the GI Bill stipend again and that was fine but it still wasn't cutting it. So now I have another job and i'm going to school.

1. How do I find out everyone I owe money to?
2. Which debts should I forget about and which debts should I pay? If the debt is X yrs old should I just forget about it like I have been?
3. Since some of the debts were incurred when I was in Kansas is the statute of limitations from that state or what?

**Goals**

1. Save up an emergency fund.
2. Save for a car.
3. Save for a home.
4. Save for retirement.

**Income**

* Paycheck = $1280 /mo

* GI Bill  = $380  /mo

* Rent     = $150  /mo

**Expenses**

* Rent         = $200 /mo

* Mobile Phone = $100 /mo

* Utilities    = $130 /mo

* Internet     = $55  /mo

* Groceries    = $200 /mo

* Gas          = $100 /mo

* Car Ins.    = $150 /mo

**Possible Expenses**

* Fast Food    = $90

* Restaurants  = $50

* Shopping     = $100

* Gaming       = $25

* Hair         = $35

With all this laid out I have started to get myself out of spending money going out, eating out, and most of the possible expenses are non expenses. They're just there if I impulse spend. Right now though, this is the first month that I've put this budget into effect and it reflects only my portion of the expenses. We split everything 50/50 almost exactly. 

So, in addition to the questions above about what to really do about finding out who I owe money to and who to pay; how should I start off saving? What should I really focus on first? My company offers to contribute 7.5% to the 401k plan. I really have no savings at all. The only thing I have is the house I own but it still has mortgage which is fully taken care of each month. The house is worth less than I paid for it though due to the market. I owe $149k and it's only worth $131k so I'm really not sure if I should just keep at that.

Just basically any advice you have PF I'm all ears.

**edit**
I just went over my credit reports and they're all pretty much the same. I created a list of all the debts where the account weren't labeled as closed. Just for ease of use I also put the date the account was created and went into collections.

**CC Debt**

* Amex (opened 4/10 status: CO) - 817
* Cap 1 (opened 8/08 status: CO)- 1551

**Util Debt**

* Westar (opened 7/10 status: C) - 394
* Cox cbl (opened 11/10 status: C) - 119
* Comcast (opened 7/11 status: C)- 192

**School Debt**

* FullSail    (opened 4/10 status: OK)- 10000 &lt;---- will begin paying
* Great Falls (opened 2/08 status: C)- 3000
* VA Debt     (opened 4/10 status: OK)- 8079 &lt;----paying

**Misc Debt**

* Ashley Furniture (opened 5/10 status: C)- 6982
* Apt              (opened 10/12 status: C)- 468
* Medical Bill     (opened 4/13 status: C)- 333

Total Debt = **31,935**

This is much more than I thought it was and a bit unnerving. Should I pay the Charge Off accounts or just pay the stuff in collections?

**edit**

After doing a small bit of simple math I've come up with the following. If I put all ""leftover money"" into paying my debts each month then I should be able to get **free** in 36 months.

Total Income - $1810 /mo

Total Expenses - $935 /mo

After Expenses - $875 /mo

Total Debt - $ 31.935

To pay off - $31,935 / $875 = **36 Months**

Here is a quick list of my questions, but I further explained the financial set-up we're working out below the fold.

1) For a joint checking account, does the bank really matter? We both have individual ING (now CapitalOne accounts), and I kind of want to switch to Ally or something just because of the strong negative associations we have with CapOne. Irrational?

2) Can we invest in a joint brokerage account, and if so, should we? My thoughts are that there could be tax complications as unmarried individuals.

3) If each individual receives $X money to spend on individual purchases (without judgment from the other), how do you incentive NOT spending it all? We both want to avoid a situation where we spend it because we have it, rather than just putting it back into savings.

4) Am I right in thinking that we could do better investing in funds in Vanguard versus using a financial adviser from Merrill Lynch? I looked through some of her plan documents and the fees she is being charged is difficult to find, and her funds' average expense ratio is 1.56%.

=====

The financial set-up my future-wife and I are setting up. 

- Joint checking account, to which we put in all our paychecks except for a certain amount of money. I think at our current incomes (which I do not count on lasting for much more than 2 years) we'd be putting in approximately $8000-$9000 a month combined.

- Money that isn't sent to the joint checking is ours to use. We are figuring out what that amount should be, her initial number is $2500 each... This is where question (2) comes in, I spend FAR less than $2500 a month on individual expenses. She *usually* does. My thought is that when our personal accounts have excess money we just put it back into the joint account, but will this actually work in practice? In spite of how much she spends relative to me I still consider her a ""saver,"" at least relative to many people in our shoes. 

- The joint account will be used for joint expenses (rent, cable, utilities), and whenever there is more than 10k we'll send the excess to an investment account OR use it towards student loans OR save for specific goals. We would discuss then when it occurs. I currently have approximately $110k in student debt, and we both agree that we'd largely tackle that first. She has never been in debt.

- Emergency fund - $30k already funded, in one of her individual savings accounts

- Maxed individual 401(k)s

How does this plan sound? We want a mix of individuality but I was pretty clear that when married I personally consider all income ""shared,"" and she agreed. There are purchases we each make that make the other roll their eyes.

I have paid it off about 3 years early with the majority of the money I earned while deployed since I wasn't paying for rent, food, gas, and other random costs. The knowledge that I no longer owe that much to my bank is incredible.    I also finished paying off my $10,000 car with the same deployment money. My monthly payments for these loans were ~$474 for the large loan and ~$306 a month for the car. That means I have an extra $780 for use in other areas. This is my plan for what to do with that money and please let me know if I have the right idea of what /r/personalfinance usually advises:

**Monthly income:** $4,400 in the bank

**Emergency Fund:** I have as of now $2,000 set aside as the usual base emergency fund that I see everyone posting about.

**Rent/Car costs:** These will be about $900 a month for the next year or so I project based on the living costs in my area. I plan on driving that car into the ground. I see no reason to get right back into car debt after just getting myself out.

**Last Student Loan:** I plan on upping my payments that were around $130 for my last student loan (Currently at $9,000. How did I manage to get myself into so much debt?) to about $500 a month to pay this off sooner.

**Roth IRA:** Currently I don't have one. The Army offers something similar called a *Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)* which I have been contributing 12% of my pre-tax income to since I joined. I really want to start a Roth though so i plan on putting ~$500 a month into one. I can search through /r/personalfinance for suggestions for the best one but if you have a clear favorite please let me know.

**Food/Bars:** I had a problem with eating out and buying a lot of expensive drinks throughout college and up till now. I don't have huge regrets about it because those were great times with close friends but I want to limit the spending at bars and plan on cooking my own food a lot more. I think about $400 should see me through each month in this area.

I am looking at this and seeing roughly $2,000 that I can spend in other areas. So what I plan on doing, unless people here have better advice, is make additional payments to the Student Loan and get my emergency fund well stocked. And yes I am going to go on a trip to Australia with the rest of my deployment money. There are few times I will have a better opportunity than in the next couple months and I have never looked back on one of my trips with regret for the costs. I plan on living in hostels if it makes a difference. 

So what are my glaring deficiencies that you all see? Am I looking at this too simplistically or do i have my priorities aligned semi-decently with your recommendations?

(US)",74,12,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/s6k47/200k_in_student_loans_graduating_and_will_be/,"I will be graduating from medical school in June with total debt of essentially $200,000 with the majority of it at 6.8% and a small portion of it at 5% ($6,000) and a small portion at 7.9% ($9,324). Our school gives us a free consultation with a physician financial planner, but I would also like to have some ideas beforehand. This will be my first salaried full-time job (have had many hourly jobs in the past), and will be working approximately 80 hours a week during residency.

**Income Background**

Here is a breakdown of my projected income. The income for the next three years during residency is estimated but at least that amount. The income for the 4th year is dependent on whether or not after I graduate I pursue a year of additional training or start working:

* Year 1: $44,000
* Year 2: $49,000
* Year 3: $54,000
* Year 4: either $250,000 (if no fellowship) or $60,000 (if fellowship)
* Year 5+: $250,000 recurring

My partner will be making slightly more than I will during residency (she is also graduating medical school and will be starting residency), but will be in training longer (six years) and make less money after those six years of training (approximately $180,000 a year). Her loans are approximately $80,000 and we plan to pay those off as soon as is feasible. My loans are more difficult, because since the amount is higher there are more options due to the possible advantage of income-based repayment.

**Question 1: Loan repayment options.**

My planned career path will leave me eligible for the public service loan forgiveness, where if I make 120 consecutive payments with income-based repayment, any outstanding debt will be forgiven. All of my loans are eligible for forgiveness under this plan. If I assume 3 years of training before the income jump, and make 120 consecutive payments (10 years) starting the first month of residency, I will be making 36 payments of about $400 and the rest of the payments after training will be about $2,500 a month. At the end of the 120 payments, I will have paid about $180,000 for my loans and the rest will be completely forgiven.

* Pros to IBR: able to live more comfortably in residency and have the opportunity to start investing early (Roth IRA in low income bracket) due to smaller monthly loan payments and allows me to pay overall less money than I took out in loans if I do forgiveness
* Cons to IBR: will need to ensure that my employment is eligible for the public service loan program so cannot work in the private setting, no security from the government that the program will not be canceled (if it is canceled after I made my 119th payment, I'd have no recourse)

The other option is income-based repayment during residency so I can at least keep the interest at bay and then just hammer down the loan as fast as I can after I graduate. The downside to this is I actually have to pay more money than if I did income-based repayment because I don't get any loans forgiven. The upside is that it's guaranteed to happen and I can work wherever I want.

**Question 2: Investments during residency.**

We have made a budget and found that we will take in about $7,700 pre-tax together monthly. We estimate that this will probably be about [edit: $6,500 post-tax]. What is the best way to estimate what our post-tax income might be for budgeting purposes? Interest payments are tax-deductible, we should qualify for educational credits, and hopefully we can maximize our deductions to minimize our taxable income. We will likely be filing separately, as I believe the income-based repayment uses tax filings to determine how much I am required to pay, and filing jointly would decrease my loan payments and therefore increase my loan forgiveness at the end of 120 payments.

Our location has a high cost of living and we are both commuting (but both our cars are paid in full). The numbers below also represent the total joint expenditures for the both of us.

* Fixed expenses: rent $1700. loan repayment $1000. utilities $100. phone $100. insurance [car, renter, disability] $250. gas from commuting $280.
* Variable expenses (groceries, restaurants, shopping, entertainment, health): $1000

This leaves us with just under $2,250 jointly every month extra (if the post-tax estimation is accurate). Although the fixed expenses seem high, the rent for the area is actually below average and the data plans on the smartphones are a requirement of our work (to access medical database information). In general, we are pretty frugal people, cook almost 100% of our meals, do a lot of bargain hunting (craigslist/slickdeals/fatwallet) and do not typically spend frivolously. Disability insurance is a must because there are plans that lock you into a rate based on health and current income and do not change rates -- therefore, getting a rate locked in at age 25 with no medical problems and an income of sub-50,000 is very advantageous.

Now ""what to do with it"" is the difficult question. If I decide to do income-based repayment, it would not be helpful at all to apply any of that money to the rest of the loans (it would never be beneficial to pay anything other than the minimum required). Therefore, savings and investment would make sense, and I would be at an income level where a Roth IRA would make sense and be beneficial, especially given the anticipated income jump. However, if I do not do income-based repayment, should I even bother putting a single cent in investment, or just put it toward my loans, since at least the first ten thousand I put towards them would be knocking down loans running at 7.9%.

Also, although I do read this forum regularly and also have read various books and such on the subject of investing, any other resources that may be of benefit to someone in my situation would be beneficial.

That also means rent is cheap, so I can get away with only dealing with about $325/month on rent and utilities. My groceries are also cheap, as well as car insurance, but I'm now making car payments of about $430/month (I have a decent APR and I have a short loan, so I'm not really here for loan advice since my interest is only going to be a few hundred bucks in the end).

So if you do the math, you can tell I'm putting quite a bit away for retirement each year. Something like $12k, I think it's actually a little more than that. So I've been getting by ""just fine"" taking home the small amount that I do, but other people are telling me to stop being so damn cheap and to live life. I'm not really sure how much I should be putting away into retirement if I want to retire comfortably. I'm putting away a lot of my paycheck because I want to retire at a higher standard of living than what I am living at right now. I don't know what amount that should be. I understand with my degree in engineering, I'll probably be making more money in the next few years if I go to a bigger city, but then I worry that cost of living will increase a ridiculous amount and that will negate the higher salary. On the other hand, even $45k is a low salary for this cheap town (edit: Ames, Iowa).

I'm not sure if that's enough information or not. Really, It's hard to ask a specific question. But does $12k/year sound reasonable for retirement at my salary? Would maybe only putting $9k/year into retirement, and then putting that extra $3k/year towards a week vacation on the opposite side of Earth be irresponsible? Everyone tells me I need to live life, and world-trips are the common suggestion I get from other people (I've only been to Mexico and Canada, live in the U.S.). I'll be honest, I would enjoy traveling and seeing places, but then again who wouldn't? I don't know what else to do with money. I don't want a fancy car, I don't want Italian designer suits, and I already have the usual emergency fund stocked up. But traveling, seeing the world, and exploring in general might be worth a few thousand dollars a year. Or is it? 

I really need to grow up, man up, and get an opinion of my own but I seriously don't trust myself to spend money on myself.

Also, if you happen to know what's similar/different between 401k plans and 403b, TSP, or whatever 401k-like stuff is out there, please share in the comments.

I'm a lazy index-investor who hopes to retire very early on a pretty frugal lifestyle of ~$50k.  I married, single income, with 3 kids.  I think a lot of this info applies to a lot of people, but if you're not exactly in my situation, you might have to adjust/adapt a bit.

**tl;dr - Sorry I'm so long-winded.  I've put all the important stuff in bold.**

**EDIT** - I have been corrected on a substantial point (that doesn't happen to affect me much, but completely alters some of what I originally stated below).  I haven't confirmed the correction, but it makes total sense, so I'm pretty sure I was indeed wrong about after-tax earnings being tax-free during a rollover.  Sorry about that.

What Makes a Good 401k?
-------------------------
There are two kinds of 401k's.  The first kind, which was by far the most common kind until recently, offers 10 or 20 mutual fund choices, none of which are index funds, and all of which have expense ratios in the .8% to 2.5% range.  The second kind, which is becoming more common every day, offers all those same lousy options, plus 4 or 5 index funds with expense ratios that are as good as you can get at Vanguard, and sometimes even better (because they are institutional shares).  **Low-cost index funds are a sign of a good 401k plan.**

The second factor to look at is your employer match.  It is not uncommon for employers to match 50% of contributions up to 7% of pay, or 100% of contributions up to 5% of pay, or some other arrangement like that.  **The employer match is free money, which is a sign of a good 401k plan.**  Even if your plan has lousy mutual funds with high expense ratios, the employer match might make it a better deal than investing in an IRA or a taxable brokerage account.  And remember, since you can roll the 401k funds into an IRA with low-cost index funds as soon as you leave the company (if not sooner), you won't be stuck with those high ERs forever.

Third, look at what kinds of contributions you can make to the 401k.  Every 401k plan offers ""Traditional"" contributions, which are tax deductible now, but are treated (along with their earnings) as ordinary income in retirement, just like a Traditional IRA.  Many 401k plans now allow Roth-style contributions, which are not tax-deductible, but are completely tax-free in retirement.  The question of whether **Roth or Traditional** is better depends on your particular situation, and is treated in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/faq#wiki_roth_or_traditional.3F).  Many online sites make blanket recommendations that young people should do Roth, but it's not such a simple decision.  RedRedditRabbit explained many of the advantages of Traditional in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/18zgci/us_lets_talk_retirement_taxes_fees_and_penalties/) a while back.

In addition to Traditional and Roth contributions, some plans also allow ""after-tax"" contributions.  While these are similar to Roth in the sense that they are not tax-deductible, they have different tax treatment.  The biggest difference between Roth and after-tax contributions is that while the total of your Traditional and Roth contributions cannot exceed $17,500 in 2013, after-tax contributions have a different limit.  Specifically, the total of all 401k contributions (Traditional, Roth, after-tax, *and* employer match) can be as high as $51,000 in 2013.  After-tax contributions can be rolled into a Roth IRA with no penalty or tax owed, and it is generally easier to withdraw after-tax contributions and their earnings before retirement.  **Plans that offer all three kinds of contributions offer flexibility that can help you optimize your taxes.**

Finally, look at whether your employer allows in-service withdrawals.  I have no sense of how common this is.  My employer offers it for certain kinds of contributions, but they don't make it obvious and I've never met another employee here who knew about it.  In-service withdrawals let you roll some of the money from your 401k plan into an IRA while you're still employed.  For example, I can't withdraw my Traditional or Roth contributions or their earnings, but I can withdraw my employer's contributions and earnings (on which I would owe tax unless I roll it into a Traditional IRA) and my after-tax contributions (on which I would owe no tax since I already paid tax) and their earnings (on which I would owe tax, unless I roll them into a Roth IRA).  **In-service withdrawals are especially nice if your plan has high ERs.**

Getting the Most from Your 401k Plan
------------------------------------
The first step to getting the most from your plan is to read your benefits information or call someone in HR and find out about your plan, and in particular the four areas described above.  Once you know the ERs, employer match, contribution options, and withdrawal options, you'll need to pick investment options.  Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* **Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match.** I've run numbers for 5 or 6 people who thought they had *really* bad options (ERs as high as 3.5%) but all of them came out better getting the match than investing in an IRA.  You might be the exception, but you probably aren't.
* **Low expense ratios are the single best predictor of fund performance.**  Resist the urge to compare funds based on past performance, especially if your plan offers many similar funds.  In any group of 10 random equity funds, one will have performed best over the last 5 or 10 years, but that doesn't mean the same one will perform best over the next 5 or 10 years.  Look for funds with low expense ratios.  Less than .2% is good, less than .1% is great.
* **Index funds are usually better than managed funds.**  Even if the ERs are the same (which is unlikely--index funds are usually much cheaper), index funds usually offer better diversification and a more disciplined strategy than actively managed funds.  You won't see as much growth during a bubble, but you also won't see as much of a loss when it bursts.
* **Apply your asset allocation to your whole portfolio, not each account individually.** What this really means is, if your 401k offers a US large-cap equity index fund with a good expense ratio, but all of its bond funds have high ERs, then you should hold all of your bonds in your IRAs and only large-cap US equities in your 401k.  If you are just starting out and don't have enough money in each account to do this perfectly, at least keep in mind that it's OK to be all-bonds in one account with a good bond fund and all-equity in another account with good equity funds.

Some Tricks for Early Retirement Planning
-----------------------------------------
This section might not be as generally applicable, but I thought I'd share my thoughts anyway.  Maybe you can tell me what I'm doing wrong, or maybe you'll realize early retirement isn't as hard as it sometimes seems.  

The main concern I have with early retirement is ensuring I have enough accessible money to last me from when I stop working for money until age 60 when I can get at my IRAs.  If you are retiring ""just a little early"" at age 55 or so, it's not too hard to keep enough money in taxable accounts to cover your expenses for a few years, and that's really the best option.  If you want to retire in your 30s or 40s though, you might consider giving up some employer match because that money would be ""locked up"" and you'll need as much as you can get in taxable accounts.  Fortunately, current tax law is full of ""loopholes"" that can make early retirement an option without giving up tax-advantages of IRAs and 401k.

The fundamental concept I plan on taking advantage of is that Roth *contributions* can be withdrawn penalty-free and tax-free at any time.  Only their earnings are locked up until age 60.  With a little planning, this can even be exploited by people for whom Traditional-style retirement accounts offer a greater tax advantage (which includes most frugal early retirees).

**Roth Conversions**

I live in upstate NY, so in addition to federal income taxes, I pay over 5% in state income taxes.  Once I stop working, I may move to a state with lower income tax.  Since I'll spend the first 20 or 25 years of ""retirement"" with no pension or Social Security income, the federal tax rate on $50k of Traditional distributions would be much less than my current marginal rate of 15%, since so much of it will be tax free (at least $10k of deductions and $19k of exemptions) and most of the rest will be taxed at 10% (currently around $17k).  But if I save in Traditional-style accounts, either 401k or Traditional IRAs, I can't get the money until age 60 (55 from the 401k if I don't roll it over).  The trick I plan on using is to convert about $50k of my Traditional savings to Roth each year, starting the year I retire.  I'll owe tax on that $50k, but the whole $50k will count as a Roth contribution, meaning I can pull it out of the Roth IRA before age 60.  Now, in the case of conversion, I have to wait 5 years after the conversion in order to pull out the contribution, so **I need enough accessible savings to last me 5 years.**  Until today, I thought this would be mostly taxable savings, but also some Roth IRA contributions.  It turns out, I have an even better option available to me.

**After-tax 401k Contributions**

**EDIT**- After-tax *contributions* can be rolled into a Roth tax-free, but not their earnings.  Since I have in-service withdrawals available to me, I can just rollover the contributions each month/year before there are any significant earnings.  However, this means only the actual contributions can be withdrawn before age 60, so I might go back to plan A with the traditional conversion to Roth.

This is the thing that I just found out about today, so forgive my enthusiasm and relative ignorance [surprise: I was wrong, see above].  But it's great, because it is a huge increase to the contribution limits for Roth-style retirement accounts.  Basically, you take all the money you would have saved in a taxable account, and instead you make after-tax contributions to the 401k plan.  When you retire, you rollover all of those contributions ~~and their earnings~~ into your Roth IRA.  There is no tax or penalty at this point, and the entire amount counts as a contribution to the Roth.  ~~So if you contribute $30k after-tax to the 401k, it grows to $50k, and you rollover the $50k, you can get the whole $50k immediately.  This is better than taxable investing because you don't owe tax on any interest or capital gains like you would in a taxable account.~~  [corrected: If you are in a low tax bracket in early retirement, rolling the earnings on after-tax contributions into a Roth IRA may cheaper than paying the eventual capital gains, but under current tax law, if you are in a low tax bracket, capital gains aren't taxed, so this section is not nearly as excited as I thought.]*

California Maritime Academy is the school I want to attend. I want to major in Marine Engineering (I'd work in the engine room on ships, etc.).

Anyways, at CMA it's typical for about 90% of the graduating class to be employed in their field within 3 months. Starting wages for people with the degree I'm seeking average about $75k a year. I've heard of many starting at over $100k-120k a year straight out of CMA. My worst case starting job would probably earn me ~$60k.

I need a credit score of 620 to be able to get approved with a cosigner and 670 without. I have a cosigner with good credit but obviously I'd like to apply alone if I could. If I can't get the loans by Winter then I'm highly considering enlisting in the Navy or Coast Guard so I can take advantage of the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill.

Throwaway, because this is very personal, and only one family member is aware of my situation.  I am a 31 year old, single male, working full-time as a software engineer, making a decent salary.  I have amassed debt throughout college and graduate school, and was foolish in how I spent/managed debt.  To further deepen the debt, I was a compulsive gambler for almost a year, and took out payday loans, title loans, and screwed myself that way as well.  I am currently seeking therapy for depression, and attend Gamblers Anonymous meetings weekly.  I have not gambled in over 3 months.

My credit is decent, but am taking hits on high revolving debt balances/high debt-to-credit utilization).  I have never missed a payment/been late with a payment, but am starting to worry that this debt is not really getting paid down.  I am somehow stopping the bleeding, but am not sure if this is sustainable long-term.

I've lurked on this subreddit for a while now, and was hoping for some help/advice, as you guys seem to be pretty awesome at this.  Please do not criticize my poor decisions.  I would like to look ahead, and focus on the best decisions from here on out, given my financial situation.  I am not looking for new loans/debt, and have not been able to qualify for any personal loans to consolidate.  I am also not at 80% LTV on my home, so equity loan/cash-out refinance is not really an option for me.

Another thing to note is that I am living paycheck-to-paycheck, with little savings, and very little in retirement.  For now, I'd like to focus on my monthly cash flow/getting out of debt.  At this point, I think my best option is credit counseling, but wanted to see what you all thought.  My parents are not able to support me financially as they are having their own financial problems at this time.  I am very embarassed, and feel so foolish about my degenerate past, and have kept this to myself before speaking to my parents.  They are suggesting Chapter 13.  Also, I do not have very many ""possessions"", out side of my bed, laptop (which I need for work/projects), and cell phone, so anything of value, I have already sold.

Here is the breakdown of my finances by *month* (rounded up to the nearest $5, min payments only):

Income (Post-Tax):  $5400

One thing I should note is that for a while (this will probably end next month), I was actually taking home ~$6000 post-tax, due to some on-call opportunities at work, which are ending soon.  I've also depending on some of these payday loans/cash advances to cover expenses when I fell short :(

Update here:

 http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1e7itf/so_happy_i_listened_to_you_guys/


So much has been happening its difficult to remember it all! Once again I just want to reiterate how glad I am that I listened to all of you and did not purchase a house and cut my expenses. Just wanted to recap all that myself and my gf have done in the past month or so. 

Housing:

If you didnt read the original, I am currently renting a house with an in ground pool that is costing me too much money. We looked into buying and after advice from this forum and others I ultimately decided against it since I did not have 20% down....

My girlfriend and I have found a place to rent with some friends and heres the kicker.... Its a really nice couple that has included food and utilities into our rent! They have told us it is just as easy to cook for four of us that just the two of them as long as we pitch in some money. We get a whole floor of the house to ourselves! Our housing expenses (rent,food,utilities) will be at $800-$1000 (depending on the heating bill in the winter) from $2300 at the house we are renting right now.

Savings: $1300-$1500 / month

Job:

I was able to score the same job  I am doing now but on a different shift for roughly a $6 an hour raise! Also this new shift will allow me to go back to school full-time and my employer will pay for it.

Increased earning: ($10-12k gross)


Savings/Retirement/Debt free goals:

Nothing major has changed here yet from the last post but after the move I am auto depositing the savings for the housing into my savings until I have 6 months emergency fund and then savings for a down payment on a house. We should be able to complete this goal of a 20% down payment in 3-4 years with maxing out my Roth IRA and my company match. Also, As long as nothing unforseen happens I should be debt free by the end of September at the latest!!!!

 

I hope my updates are an encouragement to people who think they cannot change their current situation. Admittedly, some of my success can be attributed to me starting this new job but you have to get the correct mindset first. Without the mindset I could be making $1 million a year and still be broke. 

However, I would say the majority of it came from us really trimming back our budget and finding a new place to live. Sure it's not as nice as the house with a pool but at the end of the day I have a lot less stress and am a lot more happy about not living paycheck to paycheck. 

I'll post again in September with results! 

HURRAY r/PF!

1369574967.0,60,self.personalfinance,1f2w3f,"So I want to save 550.000 bucks, but it takes way to long. Any advice? (DE)",120,60,158,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1f2w3f/so_i_want_to_save_550000_bucks_but_it_takes_way/,"*Please excuse the throwaway, but this way I can provide more accurate information.*

First, let me introduce myself: I'm a 27 years old male software developer and living in an apartment in Germany. I'm currently making 33.600€ (~$43.500) per year, which means after taxes, insurance etc. I take home about 1800€ per month. Since I'm currently hunting for a new job, this will soon be around 2000€ per month.    
In my younger years I was a little stupid regarding expenses: Of course I needed a new computer, a high-end digital camera, an expensive analogue camera and so on. Investing? That's something for future me!
At least I didn't get into debt, never ran my account below zero and always paid cash. Apart from a small car - but I'll get to that.

Well, In the last 2-3 years I read books like ""The 4-hour work week"" or blogs as ""Mr. Money Mustach"", and of course lots of interesting things on reddit. I realized I don't fit into the usual ""you need lots of stuff"" mindset, since I already owned lots of expensive stuff in the past and it didn't make me happy. (Thanks to /r/buddhism here!) But it makes me very happy if I have free time and can do whatever I want, from reading a book up to doing good stuff for others without expecting anything.    
I'd rather solve tomorrow's problems than programming boring business software: It's not about ""doing nothing"", but ""doing stuff that matters"". I just don't like corporate culture and the usual mindset.

Which brings us to today. Since I know my finances quite well, I'll give you a quick rounded breakdown with numbers from this year:

* 1800€ income after tax and deductions
* 590€ apartment rent and related stuff
* 50€ internet and mobile phone plan

That leaves us with 1160€. Since I have to commute in my current job, I bought a small used car a while ago. I took up a credit for 5000€ which will be paid off in 2015 with the current plan. (Yeah, sounded like a great idea at that time.) So here are my expenses for the car, I broke down the yearly ones:

* 131€ car credit
* 8€ car tax
* 38€ insurance
* 90€ gas
* Repairs vary, the car has over 90.000 km (~56.000 miles) on its odometer and is still going strong. For my last inspection I ended up paying about 250€.

Without repairs we have now 893€ left. Next up is the miscellaneous stuff - you might wonder about my high grocery bill, but I often buy food for my girlfriend and her daughter on the weekends, too:

* 400€ groceries (more paleo-style than western-style)
* 90€ cash (haircuts, eating out etc.)
* 6€ personal liability insurance

Which leaves me with 397€. Currently I don't invest into anything, but at least I save some money:

* 175€ go to a ""Bausparvertrag"" (uh, something like ""building savings agreement""?)
* 25€ go to a shared savings account with my girlfriend for holidays and stuff, but it's still untouched
* 25€ go to a savings account with bonuses after the 4th year (up to 50% after 20 years)

So there are 172€ left per month. From this money I need to buy stuff like clothes, computer equipment, furniture etc. and have to keep some liquid money around for emergencies (broken stuff etc.). Yes, this isn't very much.

**Now to my problem:** My combined assets are in the ballpark of just 7.000€ (minus my car credit). Since my savings are going steadily up and I have no immediate emergencies, this is *okay*, but not *awesome*. I'll get a small rent, have medical security and so on, but there's just no way to become rich in the next years.    
If my calculations are right, I need about 550.000€ to become financially independent - which is my dream. As soon as possible, of course. As you might have guessed, this is hopelessly unrealistic in my current situation ...

I already thought of a few ways to get there:

* Since I already sold the expensive stuff of the past, there aren't much more useless things here. (Luckily, I like minimalism now.)
* As a software developer, I could program some great stuff in my spare time. But: I have not the slightest idea what to create! Any hints would be appreciated - ""ideas are free"", but I can't find good ones ...
* I could look for a new job to increase my income, which I'm already doing. But this won't affect my income dramatically.
* Decreasing my monthly payings is hard, apart from the grocery bills. I'll try to shave them down to 200€ per month.
* Currently I can't really ged rid of my car, but I already keep my mileage as low as possible. I'll hope to become one of those all-weather-everywhere-bicycle-riders in the future.
* Relocation is theoretically possible, but it would put me even further away from my girlfriend - we're not living together. Regarding that, we can't move together in the next time, too. A slightly cheaper apartment close by might be possible, but I haven't found a livable one yet ...
* Buying a house or apartment would be possible with my above mentioned fully stocked ""Bausparvertrag"". Those things are expensive - 100.000€ for a small house, plus some taxes and stuff. I'd do it (and maybe rent it), but it will take a few years to get there.
* I could get a bachelor's degree in a computer related field in my spare time. That would cost me about 15.000€, takes about 3-4 years and would increase my salary in the future - but of course, that increase has to ""pay back"" the degree first. Oh, and it would eat up my spare time to do any other side-projects (see ""developer with spare time and no ideas"").
* The only way to significantly increase my income seems to be self-employment. This would cut out the mandatory expenses (insurance etc.) and allow me to maximize my hourly rate. But I fear this step because of the high bureaucracy and insecure future (25% have to quit after just three years).

So ... what would you suggest to ramp up my savings? What would work, and what would have the most impact?    
Please keep in mind, I'm from Germany, some things work a little different here - I'm happy to eplain any differences.

Oh, and thanks for your time and reading my wall of text! :)

I use the word retiring, but partial retirement would probably be a better term for it. I intend to have some kind of low stress minimal time commitment job of some sort to supplement my income. 

I am 26 currently and I make 85k a year. I have 120k in stocks and cash right now with no debt. After everything I save around 35 to 40k a year which means I'll hit my target goal around 5 to 7 years barring some unseen expense.

I don't mind living in semi poverty.  I don't really care to get married or have kids. I don't have any expensive hobbies, and my material needs are minimal. I'm willing to move to anywhere in the world where the costs of living would be more affordable. My main income would be the interest on the 300k which would be around 2% which leaves me with 6k a year (more specifically, my plan is to be mostly in stocks and withdraw 6k from it every year. This leaves room for some growth and protection against inflation) . I will scrounge up another 6k to 12 k with some part time gigs.  How realistic would this be?

So I've been lurking in this Reddit a few months, and started commenting recently during my downtime. I'm a CFP, but I'm not client-facing, and don't solicit business (my job keeps me busy enough).

Anyway, I've noticed 2 posting trends that I wonder if we could do more to address in this subreddit:

1) Posts where OP has not a freaking clue where to start with any of this financial stuff, and fears making changes or decisions for fear of messing everything up

2) Posts where OP has got a beginner's knowledge on basic financial planning and instruments (e.g. How to set up an IRA, contribute to a 401(k), manage bank accounts), but needs help prioritizing

I'm considering creating a short podcast series that goes through the basics of financial planning (e.g. Managing money, getting/keeping a good credit score, investing), and setting up beginner strategies (e.g. Prioritizing money, automating the budget and bills, racking up loyalty points on credit cards without trying), but I'd hesitate to put all that work in for free, unless people are going to listen to and use it.

What do you guys think? Is that something you'd want?

Edit: What subjects/topics would you like to see addressed?

Edit 2: I do not take on clients. I work as a knowledge specialist for an insurance company that offers group investments. Given that I spend 3-5 hours a day researching provincial investment/tax legislation in Canada, I figured I could be of use to more than just our sales team.

-$48,000 in private student loans, ranging from 5%-14%, costs $300 per month in interest (deferred for 1 more month)

-$6,000 Federal Stafford

-$90 phone. Go to prepaid for $35, or skype for $8 per month

-$270 Rent (currently living with parents again)

-$80 entertainment

**Up to $2,050 leftover**

**How I got here:** I take complete responsibility for this. I already know I'm at the level of bankruptcy. Trying to stay above water and pay these bills for the last two years are what caused me to get deeper and deeper. I'm going to try and do bankruptcy to give me a chance to get pay my student loans. Since graduating high school I have slowly been going downhill. I did get a bachelor's degree but I lived off of credit cards at times, I spent several hundred more per month than I made with little regard for a budget. I was never taught how to manage finances, my parents both managed money poorly, I had easy access to credit, but most of all I was stupid for a long long time and refused to change.

Well now I am ready to change. I got rid of everything I own, I am ready to be frugal. If anybody reads this far down... I am thinking about staying with my slightly crazy mom for the next 5 years at which time I could be debt free. Should I do that? Or get my own place, possibly try and get more schooling within a few more years? My other plan was to join the military as an officer in a few years to help me get out of debt and finish educational goals. 

**Edit:**
I know about the standard:

1. Pay off debt

2. Emergency fund for 6 months

3. max out 401k/ira

I just need to know general advice, if I should contribute to 401k with 4% match, and if you think I should be focused on more school or living etc.

Although I try to follow that every time I get a paycheck, I honestly can't handle not giving myself guilty-pleasure/leisure money, even if it puts me behind (sometimes months behind!) on one of the above goals.

*by nonessentials, i mean everything that is not ""i need to pay this else people will knock down my door with a vengeance""

So major props to the frugal, but for those who can't constantly live like that: 

* What nonessentials do you dish out for?  What's your justification? 
* How do you decide how much to allow yourself to spend?    
* Is there anyone here who was initially very strict with their spending ways and then went, ""NOPE, NEVERMIND,"" and let themselves be more flexible?  
* How about the opposite: is there anyone who was somewhat chill with their money (not in a SPEND ALL THE MONEYS but just a ""i like treating myself a lot"") but then went ""FUCKKKKK, NOPE"" and became stricter?
* and related, etc. etc. 

For example: I used to be super strict with my spending - $200/month for food+transportation+pleasure*, but now I'm much looser because it sucked not being able to hang with friends because, ""hey, that's a little bit over my planned budget"" and I really didn't like that ""I'm financially stretched"" feeling at the end of the month which, while survivable, felt incredibly unnecessary for me.  Now, I eat out once a week because dammit, I like eating out.  I'll take the bus instead of walking to work because dammit, my feet are tired.

Cutting to the chase: I graduated in May 2012 from a state university in the U.S. where I had a full ride scholarship. Though I had a fully paid education, throughout college, I worked part time as a bartender, and managed to save about 20k over the course of 4 years.

I am generally frugal and save about 30% of my after tax income. I also opened a Roth IRA in 2012, and maxed it out for that year. I plan on continuing to max this yearly contribution.

I know, this all sounds like a big showcase of my good fortune and I hope I'm not coming off as some insensitive money ditz, but what I am trying to get at is: I really have no idea what to do with this savings to make it ""work for me"" as they say.

I feel like my savings is just sitting there... netting about $15 per month in my money market acct.; I'm supposing I could do better.

I'm writing on behalf of a friend of mine. He's not a Redditor, but I'm hoping you guys could pass along some sage advice that I might be able to pass along to him.

Long story short, my friend opened a Savings account with Wells Fargo and put his life savings in there (about $50K). He does his primary banking at BofA, but thought it would be a good idea to diversify, hence Wells Fargo for his savings. They talked him into some sort of combo account that gave him a savings and a checking account all umbrella'd together. He also specifically mentioned that he did not want or need ATM access, yet two weeks after opening the account, he received ATM cards, one of which he destroyed, the other he put into a safe. 

Fast forward a month, he receives a returned check in the mail that had bounced. The check had his name on it, with a forged signature (it didn't even resemble his). When he checked his account online, he discovered that someone had been writing fraudulent checks, transferring money from his savings to his checking account, and then running dozens of ATM, debit and check transactions against that checking account. Both accounts were now totally empty.

He called Wells Fargo and notified their fraud division, which conducted a 40 day investigation, and now they are refusing to refund any of the money, claiming that it must have been my friend or an authorized agent of his who engaged in the transactions.

In the course of the investigation, it was also discovered that the thief had changed the contact information in his account so that any fraud notices were now sent to a different phone number, likely a burner phone that would allow the thief to re-authorize the account.

My friend contacted the LAPD with his story as well, and was told by the detective that Wells Fargo is notorious for denying claims like this.

The obvious solution is to lawyer up. But he's not really in a financial position to be able to do that. Just curious if anyone has a similar experience or could point to a direction that I could advise him. 

We're also curious as to how the thieves got access to his accounts - Clearly they needed a tremendous amount of information about him.

Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated. I don't have a clue how to advise him, and he's pretty inconsolable right now, he's worked his entire life for that cash, and to have it just wiped out like that... man.

Thanks in advance.

- I'll be 'saving' the money on the new place, as it's price will have similarly fallen. 
- I don't need to make my money back the same way I lost it, meaning there is no difference in waiting for my current place to rise in value vs. buying a new place and having it rise in value.
- I wouldn't be underwater and could buy a bigger/nicer/newer place with my higher income and lower interest rates in 2012.

What should I do with it?",68,10,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/p5xuo/hello_i_recently_quit_starbucks_and_they_gave_me/,"First of all, thanks for anyone who offers advice.  If you aren't familiar with Starbucks, it's a great company. They give even their part time employees stock options every year, and I also contributed to a stock investment plan, where a percentage of each paycheck was put towards buying stock at a lower price.

I worked there for almost five years, and recently moved on to a full-time job.  What I am left with is as follows:

* 29 stock options with an exercise price of $22
* 63 stock options with an exercise price of $8.64
* 58 shares of SBUX stock

The stock options expire March 1.  SBUX is around $48 right now so obviously it is in my best interest to exercise my stock options. If you do the math, at $48/share, the total value of all of my shares+options (minus the total exercise cost for the options) is around **$6,000.**

A little about me: I'm 25, I have about $2k in credit card debt, my monthly expenses total about $1500, and I very recently started a job that pays about $3k monthly.  (Also, I have *very little* knowledge of investing, stock market, IRA's, etc.)

**Here's my question: I can do one of three things. Which one is smartest?**

* I can exercise and sell all of my options, *and* sell all of my shares, and take the money.  I would use the money to pay off my credit cards *and* open a Roth IRA.

* I can hold on to my shares, but exercise and sell my options.  This would net me about $3200, and I would still have 58 shares of SBUX.  I would use that money to pay off my debt, but I doubt there would be enough left over to start a Roth IRA with (correct me if I'm wrong.)

* I can hold on to my shares, and exercise and *hold* my options.  I would have to sell about 25 shares, to cover the exercise costs.  I would be left with 125 shares of SBUX, but no cash.  I would have to wait to pay off my credit cards for a few months.  Consider - SBUX has been rising steadily for a year straight, from less than $30 a year ago to almost $50 now.

Right now I'm leaning toward option 2: I want to get rid of my credit card debt ASAP, but I also want to keep at least a few shares of SBUX in case it keeps going up.

Would it be smarter to open a Roth IRA instead of keeping those shares? Would it be smarter to keep all the shares, and pay off my debt once I've received a few paychecks from my new job?

We're both professionals, which required many extra years in school as opposed to earning a wage. I'm 27 and am a lawyer; she's 26 and is a doctor. I've been working a few years now and she has a year left in her residency. 

Here's where we need some advice. We want to have at least three kids and are thinking about timing the birth of our first to correspond to when my wife will be done with residency. However, we want to make sure that this is a good time, financially. Obviously, she won't have started working yet, so there is some concern there. On the other hand, it would be much more difficult for her to take time off from work after a year or two of starting her career. We also don't want to have kids much later than 35 or 36, which only leaves about a seven-year window from now. 

So PF, what are your insights on the subject? Any advice? 

**Edit to add some info about our financial situation:**

* About $500k in student loan debt (I know, I know)

* Savings of about $5k, but will increase to at least $15k before the baby would be born 

* No mortgage, no credit card debt

* Will likely take about $500k more of debt within a year or two (business debt, so it will be positive cash flow immediately)

* Current income is about $90k/year, but should be anywhere from $200k - $300k/year after my wife starts working. That has the very realistic chance of increasing to up to $500k/year within 5 years of her starting her career. 

* We will put off buying a house for at least 3 years or more until we could build up about $50k or more for a down payment

* We live in a very low cost of living area of the country 

* During this whole time we plan to aggressively attack the student debt and business debt with a large portion of that income.

**It's not the best financial circumstance, but it is what it is. Obviously, in a perfect world we would wait at least 5 years to have our first child, but we're already 26 and 27. Waiting too much longer will take us out of our prime baby-making years, considering the 9-month manufacture delay.**

1369688592.0,61,self.personalfinance,1f5piq,I just landed the perfect second job to assist me in my PF goals: Resident Manager for my apartment building!,83,22,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1f5piq/i_just_landed_the_perfect_second_job_to_assist_me/,"I have a significant amount of consumer and student loan debt, so I was planning on buckling down this summer and getting a second job for the weekends tending bar or something.  Instead, I got hooked up when the previous resident manager of my apartment building asked me if I wanted him to recommend me for the job.  I got it!

I had never really thought about this kind of work before, but it's pretty ideal for my situation.

PROS: 

1. I live RENT FREE (originally was paying $1300+ for my apartment), and get a modest salary of $1100/month.  
1. The free rent aspect is not taxable as income
1. Workload is only ~10 hours a week, or ~20 hours if a lot of residents all of a sudden decide to vacate at the same time
1. I'm not a superintendent, just a manager, I don't really have to do any maintenance, I just make the phone call to get someone there to fix things.
1. I learn valuable new skills that I can one day utilize when I am financially secure enough and want to begin investing in real estate

CONS:

1. I'm basically on call all the time for emergencies etc.
2. I can't be spontaneous and get out of town for the weekend whenever I want. (although this is kind of a pro as well, since it's going to force me to not spend money on such getaways)


I'm really excited about this gig, and for the first time I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  As I'm still working another full time job, I'll basically get all of my consumer debt ($20,000+) paid off in 7 months, and then I'll start chiseling away at my student loans, while also saving up money for buying a home.  

**tl;dr**: Being a resident manager is a great part time job to get out of debt or save up money quickly, because you can live rent free.

This is only true on interest paid on said loans, but not on the loan principal itself. I'll try to explain simply below. But please, don't take my word for it. Here are plenty of sources that explain why 'double taxation' is a myth much better than I can:

* [myfinancialawareness.com](http://www.myfinancialawareness.com/Topics%20Financial/Myth%20-%20401(k\)%20Loans.htm)

My take on it?

**The Myth:**

401(k) loans are double taxed. First, when you pay back the loan with post-tax dollars. Second, after you retire all distributions are taxed as regular income. 

**The Explanation:**

It doesn't matter that you are paying back the loan with post-tax dollars. I think the pdf linked to on the federal reserve website puts it best. 

&gt; Since loan proceeds are not taxed when distributed, the tax on repayment is really just a delayed tax on the consumption of the loan proceeds"". 

Here are two examples, ignoring fees and interest for now.

*case 1:* I take out a 401(k) loan of $5000 and then immediately pay it back, I have not been taxed a single dollar. It doesn't matter if I pay it back using the pre-tax money I just pulled out of my 401(k), post-tax money out of my savings account, or free money I found in a safe I discovered in my deceased grandmother's home. I had a $5000 loan, and then I didn't. Isn't that simple?

*case 2:* I take out a $5000 401(k) loan and buy a used car on craigslist. I just bought a car with money that I didn't have to pay federal or state income taxes on. What sorcery is this!? Well, when I repay the loan with post-tax dollars, I am at that time paying income taxes on the money that I used to buy the car.

**But what about the interest?**

Again I think the federal reserve pdf puts it best:

&gt; Loan interest payments, on the other hand, can indeed be considered double-taxed undertraditional consumption tax principles—since interest payments are like new contributions,
they should be made with pre-tax dollars and then taxed upon withdrawal. In practice,
however, the double-taxation of loan interest relative to a consumption tax is oﬀset by the
break borrowers get on the timing of their tax payments: recall that rather than paying
taxes on loan proceeds when they are distributed (i.e., consumed), borrowers pay the taxes
gradually over the following ﬁve years as they repay the loan with after-tax dollars. The
time value of these delayed tax payments oﬀsets the double taxation of interest—perfectly
so, if the discount rate is the pre-tax rate of return; only partially if the discount rate is
lower.

I hope that helps clear up any misconceptions on the matter. There are certainly other reasons to not get a 401(k) [edit: loan], but you can take 'double taxation' off of your list.

Durring this year my husband and I had a complete ""oops"" baby ( I was on BC and we were using condoms. TOTAL accident). I'm just recovering from my C section and I want to get back into the workforce and get us out of this hole. 

Currently I have $3770 worth of medical bills in collections from when I didn't have insurance through my husbands work. I have $2268 in student loans and I'm working on getting another deferment. I have Around $1000 in misc. debt that's not on my credit report yet, and my daughters hospital bills haven't come in the mail. She was a preemie and spent about a week in the NICU. My insurance pays 90% of the medical expenses.

My husband has about $3500 give or take in student loans, and $7000 on a car that he voluntarily had repossessed. The leasing agency wants us to make weekly payments, he agreed to $30 a week because they started court proceedings.  He borrowed money from a friend to bail us out of a bad spot when I lost my job, so that's another $2500. He's got around $1000 (guessing wayy high because I'm not sure of the exact number) in misc debt as well. 

We're living paycheck to paycheck. Literally down to the dollar unless he works overtime. I've cut out everything I can and I can't get us out of this hole. I want to have an emergency fund, but I also want to pay this debt down. I know I need to get back to work. I'm in Michigan where the economy is shittier than most places, so it's very difficult to find work. 

Our friend is hounding us for this money and I want to give him the tax return. My husband filed single 0 all year and will get to claim married 2. So we should have a decent return.  

I need suggestions or ideas on which debts to pay first, and which to let go for a while. Any ideas. I'm going to get us on Food stamps, and I'm already on WIC for my daughter but it doesn't cover everything.


Our total monthly income is $1780

    $750 in rent

    $120 electric

    $170 cell bill. I've already reduced it as much as possible for my husbands work. We don't have ipones, but we have basic androids that came free.

    $400 groceries, this includes toiletries, formula, diapers and everything baby needs as well

    $50 in natural gas

    $50 car insurance (We only have 1 car and fill up every 2 weeks)

    $70 gasoline

    $30 water (billed every 3 months and just set $30 aside each month)

Overtime this time of year can vary from 10-20+ hour extra a week. It's available most weeks.

I've applied for at least 10 jobs daily since about 2 weeks after she was born.

I won't be spending any money on Christmas unless it's the money I get from my birthday, and I'll use that to buy things my 2month old needs. My 21st birthday is next week and I'm not even going out.

I have been out of college working a $60k/year (more like $45k year post taxes) job for about a year now and have no student loans to pay off.  Aside from rent and some intermittent luxury purchases (Macbook, plane tickets, etc.) I don't really have anything big for which I am saving up.   I currently have around $20k all in a checking account with Bank of America (taboo, I know).

I'm looking for a couple first steps I can take to wisely invest and save my money.  I've realized the first is to get my money out of a checking account, but I don't know where to move it.  So far my plan is:

1. Open up a Roth IRA with Vanguard ($5,000)
2. Max out my 401k contributions

After this, I really don't have any idea what to do.  I've read to switch to a Credit Union instead of a bank, but I don't understand why.  I've also read to put in a couple thousand dollars to an ING direct account, yet I don't fully understand what would happen to that money.  Any advice you could give me would be greatly appreciated.

Victory post!",75,16,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/10n5fa/paid_off_a_car_loan_12500_in_5_months_monthly/,"Hi all, been ~~trolling~~ lurking reddit for a while, recently decided to make an account.  I don't have many friends that understand the debt demon but I felt the need to tell people who would appreciate.

I have monthly expenses of ~$500, this includes rent / utilities (i have roommates) and car insurance.  I luckily have a fantastic employer that pays for my internet to supply work at home needs and my cell phone bill.  I was able to drop all of my excess pay, between $2,400-$2,800 depending on the month and other unexpected expenses (like popping a tire on a nail from road work).  Cut out all the luxuries except my Fuller's beers.  I love beer.

Best advice I can give to people who have debts and want them gone, is to cut down every expense you can and make a budget!!!  If you know what you can spend and what you are spending, you know how to make your money work for you.  My biggest cut was moving from dining out for lunch to bringing a bagged lunch.  I averaged a $10 meal a day, 5 days a week.  I squeezed my pennies at the grocer and ended up losing weight and eating healthier!  Plus I learned to cook a decent few meals, something I've never been good at!

If you have debts, and don't know where to start, I suggest listening to Dave Ramsey's radio show.  It is a great place to hear others with worse debt issues than you may have and the callers give you the confidence that you can reduce your personal debt and live a debt free lifestyle!

My mom, 60, is not doing well at all.

She's tried to sell her house for nearly 3 years and the market has been just terrible (she lives in NE Massachusetts). She didn't buy the best house, had to drop nearly $70k to fix it up, and despite that has continued to lose value on her home - and it won't sell. She's dragged it out so long that she's put herself into a serious financial pickle. She makes about $60k/year (nets around $3600/mo) and can't change jobs, because she doesn't have a college education and will have a tough time finding work, but is paying $3000/mo on just her mortgage, which she has refinanced multiple times. Her home equity is dry, has less than $20k in her 401k after liquidating it to pay bills, and is in mountains of debt - I'm not exactly sure how much, but my guess is in excess of $50k.

It's now so bad that she can't afford groceries and has basically stopped paying all of her bills except for the mortgage. It's been bad for a while - I gave her $5,000 to try and help back in May, but she's already used that up. I fully understand I'm not getting that money back ever.

I don't know what to do or how to help her - I feel like giving her more money won't really do anything, because the debt is just so bad. I don't know what advice I can give her so she can get out of this insane hole she put herself in. A big problem is she has serious pride issues - she won't file for bankruptcy or do anything that would cause her to not pay off her debts. She's being ultra stubborn about, even if she does sell her house, that she wants to own a place, even if it's a condo - she has too much pride to begin renting again.

The bureaus' answer? They think the account in question belongs to me and is my responsibility, despite the fact that the fraudulent account's billing address is *in a state I've never lived in*.

Next step: Get on the horn with AT&amp;T customer service and get the records of my previous exchanges with AT&amp;T customer service that confirm that the account in question was fraudulent.

I'm not sure if I should contact the collection agency myself, or ask AT&amp;T to contact them again (they said that everything was taken care of 8 months ago, but that clearly did not happen). 

I hope that AT&amp;T will get everything resolved and have this fraudulent account removed from my credit report.

I work 40 hours a week for school/internship? basically school requires us to work 1800 hours in our 4 year education at a company.

I pay all the bills i have myself. (Insurance,phone,gym,clothes,sports)

My income:

I have the small amount of money i get from the school working at a company (185 euros a month)

I work at a restaurant as a dishwasher. I dont really enjoy working more than once a week because its a boring job. But yet i do work 2/3 times per week at the restaurant from 6PM till 11PM/1AM.



I started my own small business at marktplaats which is like craigslist.
I build PC's for cash assist people at their home with building PC's or problems with their tablets/pc's/router etc. All the money i earn with this is cash.



So now how i divide my funds and will keep dividing it like this.

I took my moms big ol' wallet.(Multiple compartments)
Put in each compartment a note of what i want. (Tech,Hobby's,furniture,going out,luxuries)

Then i put all of my cash leftovers,earnings and tippings in there in the compartment of what i want.

With my bank account im saving up for a drivers license and a new pc.




Income for the bank account are. pocket money, Study finance ring, Care allowance,wages(work and internship).

The bills for gym,insurance,phone get depriaciated automatically. Then every month i put my leftover money on my savings account.

Thank you reddit and i hope this helps someone or gives someone an idea.


Edit: Things i did to save cash (Bringing bread and fruit to work, buying less small crappy things i don't really need and the biggest one of all taking 3 days before doing a big purchase to make up my mind about really needing it!)

They said I can essentially re-apply in April 2013 after I undergo a followup visit with a doctor. Apparently I have a symptom that does not have a specific cause and therefore they are postponing my application.  

Any advice? I have 200k through my current employer (does not require medical questionnaire), but this won't travel with me if I change jobs. Where do I start? Do I work with my doctor and obtain a copy of the records that the insurance company used to make this determination and try to appeal?

Living in a 2 bedroom unit(renting) with my girlfriend. GF did not have job for last 10-12 months, but she got a part time job from this week, so she earns around $1200 pm. She is going to help me pay the debt and day to day home expenditure.

The way I see, there is no way out of it without me getting another high paying job. But it might take a while, and everyday, just thinking about it is making me panic.

Please help me plan my way out of it, a plan to have my balance $0.

**Edit 1: **
Thank you for all the replies guys.
I posted the thread just before midnight(AU) and went to bed. Just woke up to a surprise that so many of you had good suggestions.
I'll try to answer all the queries a bit more:

* **Dhukuti situation:**
15 close friends make a group, decide an organiser who deals with collecting and paying, and start paying each month.
At the end of month, one person gets a maximum of 14,000.(there is more to it, if anyone is interested, I can explain further)
Like everyone would have imagined, everyone wants to get the money first.
But the organiser gets the money first, because he is the one calling the people if they are not paying(usually, with close friends, no one tries to screw over anyone else), organising tender to decide who wins and things alike.
I took the money on the second month and paid more than half of my personal loan. It was a $15k to start at 16% variable loan, and I paid almost $6k in excess(which I can withdraw if I need to). Currently, I need to pay $6660 on my loan.
The remaining $10k is the 10 instalments I need to pay for next 10 months for the dhukuti, because I took my share already. So, no backing out from here unless I betray my friends. They cannot make me pay if I choose not to, but I don't want to be a bad friend.
I knew it would be hard for me to involved in dhukuti, but getting the interest free money so early helped me cut down on my interest on the personal loan.

* **Studyroom situation:**
I'm a system admin at one university. This is my first job out of university, and this September, it will be three years in this place. I spend $7k on training for CCNP(course that will help me move on to Network Engineer role hopefully). The training finished at the end of July. So, in my study room, I have 10 cisco routers/switches, 6 HP servers, 5 workstations. This is my personal lab, where I test everything that I come across/read about.
I think what I'm getting from my current job is way too less for the skill I give them. That's the reason I am thinking of getting another job(which hopefully will be little high paying as I have enhanced my skills/expertise). Recently was offered a job in Amazon Web Services through LinkedIn, so I'm hopeful.
I understand there is a huge saving if I can rent out that study room, now I need to decide how to get rid of my home lab.

* **Girlfriend situation:**
Due to some visa reason, she was not able to work, now it is all good. One day I'm going to marry this girl. With my culture, it is little different than you guys think. She will help to pay the debt with everything she earns(what I earn and what she earns, we combine it. There is no such thing as my money or her money), and I can decide where to spend. I think paying for your GF for 10-12 months to help her at hard times is reasonable. She is looking to get another part time job, and also talking with the employer to make the current job a full time one. I just talked to her about renting another room, and she says lets see for 1-2 week if the employer gives her full time, or if she finds another part-time job.

 **Things I'm doing to cut cost:**


* I'm moving to $30pm no contract plan on my phone. I'll buy the SIM card today.
* I'll need Internet as I need to check server status and things from home. Also, need it for research and study. $30pm on phone gives me 6GB data...I want to see if that is enough for me. If it is, I'm going to cancel it. But the problem is, there will be huge cancellation fee.
* No eating outside or buying lunch. Bringing lunch made from home. That saves $240 per month.
* Be in the lookout for suitable person to rent other room. Ideally someone who is in IT field, so I don't have to get rid of my equipment. I'll let him use it as well, and I use it when I need to.
* I have paid $6k in excess to my personal loan. I'm keeping it there because, its rate is higher than my CC(11.9%) Don't think it makes sense to withdraw that and pay my CC.
* I'm working with a cabler/electrician during the weekend. He pays me $200 per day. If I quit my IT job, I actually will earn more ($1200-$1400 compared to current $800). But I cannot decide if I should quit IT and become a tradie. I think it is not a good long term goal. I've talked with him, and he says he will try to give me atleast 1 shift per week...so that is $800 extra income per month.

Thank you all again, and sorry I couldn't reply earlier.

* Mother opened a card tied to a joint account I have with her (from way back in ~~high school~~ *credit card was started while I was in college*) ""for emergencies"". She even gave me the ""Don't use it unless it's an emergency"" speech.

* I was an idiot and didn't actively monitor the damn thing. Turns out SHE was using it as a regular credit card and had maxed it out.

* This is/was affecting my credit, so I spoke to her about it. I went in today and *using my own money* paid off the card and requested it be killed. I'm now waiting for confirmation that it's gone.

* My mother has said she will pay me back, but I can not count on that.

My emergency fund is completely gone now.

I did my research before I paid this, by the way. I called the bank, credit agencies, and even looked through previous posts here. (See [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/paxxr/mom_put_teenme_on_an_account_and_then_stopped/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/q1cw1/21_years_old_mom_opened_a_credit_card_in_my_name/) for similar situations)

1. I WAS legally responsible for this debt, even though I never bought a damn thing with it.

2. There is a cash reserve associated with the joint account. I've asked her to shut down the joint account and move it to an account entirely in her name, but that won't be until all outstanding charges to the checking account go through (so at least a week or so).

3. She gets (in addition to her paycheck) child support payments, which will be ending soon. I'm really scared if she overdraws the account because she's still acting as if she has child-support money, I'll get stuck again: unable to remove myself from the situation because it's got a balance on the CASH RESERVE even though I took care of the credit card situation.


* **What is my next step re: getting her to pay me back?**

* **How do I protect myself and cut myself from the joint account safely and as soon as possible?**

(Xpost r/askreddit)",83,26,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/vboi2/my_stepdad_just_performed_his_best_fckup_and_now/,"This requires some background detail before I get to the actual f*ckup. My 'stepdad', here on out known as Pete, has a history of cheating on my mother and generally being stupid, it had reached the point where they no longer lived together as husband and wife, but as roommates sharing the bills due to financial strain on them both and the fact that neither can pay the mortgage without the other. He is the definition of an inconsiderate roommate and lives like a slob.

My mom has had a steady and very supportive boyfriend for the past 5 years (the relationship started post roommate status), but he is unable to move here to take Pete's place because the terms of his own divorce make him unable to move outside of a so many miles wide bubble with his 14 year old son. Due to this situation, he has his own rent to pay for and is only able to help us out so much.

This had all gone relatively well until last night Pete was caught stealing a $10 case of beer from a store to give to his girlfriend (I did not say he was a smart man). As a result, he is barred from entering this chain of stores; but, because his job requires him to do so, he now has a very high chance of being fired, or in the best case scenario he is put on a different route that requires him to drive further out of the area; we will know in the next couple of days.

No matter what he does my mother is done trying to live with him and is going to kick him out of the house. She plans to refinance the house if she can, and if not, file for bankruptcy. She does not want to have to sell the house or leave the area because of my two younger sisters in middle and high school, one of whom is a very SAP and will not do well having to make new friends in an unfamiliar group. I am 19 and in college, and through a bittersweet turn of events, this situation will actually leave me better off financially in the form of improved financial aid.

Assets/options we have:  
-Bankruptcy  
-Refinance  
-Sell the house and buy a smaller/cheaper one in the school district.
-Food stamps  
-Up to $30k veteran's loan  

tl;dr Fuckup of a 'stepdad''s final straw, now my mother is kicking him out and is looking for ways to take care of herself and my sisters financially and possibly keep the house.

My question for you, Reddit, is what other options does my mom have? Continuing to live with Pete is no longer an option as she does not want to have to rely on him to bring in a paycheck.

**Edit:** Thanks for the replies so far, I have to go to work. I will be back tonight to check in and answer any more questions.

**Edit2:** More information: We live in upstate NY, her boyfriend lives in NYC. We were walking a financial tightrope before this happened, so things are that much tougher now. My mother plans to get a lawyer to help weigh the options. To those saying it is a bad situation, thank you, but that is not news to me. And for those pointing out that my mother never should have put a mortgage on the house, I am not going to chastise her for poor decisions in the pst, I would much rather be able to provide her with sound advice to carry into the future.

**Edit3:** Thank you for all of the information, I will be writing up a list of all of the options with pros and cons to give to my mother. I am hoping to be a leveling factor for her, to help her rationalize what is best and what is possible.

**UPDATE:** My mom is currently waiting on Pete to decide whether he wants to sign his name off of the deed, or if he wants to keep the house. If he keeps the house my mom is going to try to make it a part of the legal separation that he has to refinance and give her half of the value and she will remove herself from the deed and mortgage. If he signs off then she will refinance with her boyfriend as he has been planning to move in with my mom once his son graduates highschool, or if his son decides he wants to go to school up here.

I recently moved to the US for a job. The last few weeks I've just used funds from my non-US bank, but with my paychecks coming in and the transaction/exchange fees it makes sense to start managing it locally.

I've read two books about managing personal finance in the US and have researched a good amount online and think I have a relatively good understanding of the system. However, before I start putting money into the wrong places, I'd like to have my assumptions confirmed and some details clarified.

This is what I'm currently planning to do:

1) Open savings account (200%-300% of monthly expenses in it - ""safety cushion"") and checking account (I'll have my paycheck deposited in here; at the end of each month the remaining money will go to my investment account) at a bank. Currently I'm favoring Bank of America simply because one of their branches is down the street and they have many locations/ATMs; any other recommendations? Online Banking is important to me.

2) Get a credit card. I don't care about rewards etc. I always pay 100% of my credit back in time. Now one question that I had was if it is possible to have the money I've spent on my credit card automatically withdrawn from my checkings account. The credit score is something I'm not worried about at the moment, but building it wouldn't hurt. Any tips?

3) Open a Roth IRA (I'll max out the allowed investment here) and an investment account (Mutual Bonds/Stock Funds) with Vanguard Group. I'll pursue a fairly aggressive investment strategy, but that's another topic. For the Roth IRA: If I was to leave the US, can I still keep the account and continue depositing money?

Ok and here are two more general questions:
- The reason Mutual Fund Companies are recommended is the lower expense ratio, correct? Any other reasons?
- I am considering using Mint.com (or any other application/service capable of automatically retrieving account information) for convenience. I'm concerned about this being a security risk. Does anyone know what steps the banks and software developers have taken to make sure nobody can get my information?

I ended up maxing it out within a year and then making the minimum payments while I was in school for several years. I lived in an apartment (never in the dorms) and worked part time to pay for my rent/food/car/credit card. I was making pretty good money for a part time position (14/hr), but during my third year of college I lost my job and ended up falling behind on everything. I got another credit card with a $2000 limit and used that to pay my bills while I looked for another job but could not find one making more than half what I was. I ended up maxing that card, adding another $1000 to my first one on the ""overdraft protection loan"", and then only making 7.50/hr I still could not afford my bills. My car was repossessed, I was almost evicted but managed to avoid that, and I stopped paying my credit cards completely. I managed to get back on track so that I could live, but I was still avoiding my credit cards which ended up in collections. During my final year of college I was sued by both of them, they both got judgements against me, and I ended up filing chapter 13 bankruptcy. The total debt written off was just over 20k after all of the fees and interest and the remaining balance on my car loan (and a few smaller debts that I haven't mentioned). My repayment plan terms were $200/mo for 5 years, which is ending at the end of this year.

I now work as a software developer and make around $50,000 (48k last year, more this year). My credit is awful, I haven't gotten the actual scores but I get the free reports every year and they look terrible. I am pretty much clueless about what I should do to help myself, I have filed some claims with the reporting agencies about bad marks on my reports that should have been included in the bankruptcy and all of them were actually changed in my favor so I am proud of doing that much at least. I need to know how to start rebuilding my credit at the end of this year once I am finally done with the bankruptcy repayment plan, because until then I cannot get any new lines of credit, and I haven't since I filed for it 4.5 years ago.

If you need any more info please ask, I am not even sure what anyone might need to give me some good advice, but that is my story, thanks for reading.

We have been struggling financially for a year or two, and it's getting worse.  I'm looking for your advice on a couple of specific subjects, but I'll list all of the pertinent details so that anyone can chime in on any other subjects.


Total net monthly income: $2425.00
We have 2 checking accounts, no savings.  We live hand-to-mouth, there is never any money left over to consider putting into a savings account or investing.

Monthly expenses:

My car - ~$300

Wife's car - ~$225

Mortgage - ~$350

Utilities (water, electric, internet) - ~$200

Gas expense (from long commute to work) - ~$340

Oil changes, other car expenses (estimated to include tires, rotations, alignments, etc. etc.) ~ $100

Estimated Monthly Medical expenses (incl. doctor's visits and prescription meds- ~ $120

Pet supplies/pet care - ~$50

Food/groceries/household items - ~$275

Credit card debt - ~$100


My wife also has student loans, but to be honest, we've defaulted on them, and aren't making any payments on them.  Things like house, car, and utilities had to take a priority.


The remaining balance get trickled away on food, convenience store stops, health &amp; beauty items, etc.  There's never actually any ""extra"" money at the end of the month.


My wife &amp; I have both quit smoking in an effort to save money, and that has helped.


I know that one of my biggest problems is my commute.  I am the part owner of a restaurant that my father and I opened up together, and I'm reluctant to give it up, but it's not doing well enough for me to pay myself any better.  I have been examining other options, but I really do not wish to work in another restaurant, and I have no other marketable skills other than a 12 year history of managing and owning restaurants.


One of my biggest problems is my car.  It is currently parked, and needs about $1500.00 worth of work to get it road-ready again (has a cracked cylinder, needs a full engine replacement.)  I still owe over $7000 on this car.  I have no idea how I could get out from under this debt.  No dealership is going to take it as a trade in for anything *remotely* close to what I owe on it, even if it *didn't* need so much work.  Should I just stop making payments on it and let it get repo'ed?  It has been repossessed once before, a few years ago, but I managed to get it back.  Wish now I had just let it go.


I haven't checked my credit score in a couple of years, but I imagine it's hideous, between my wife's defaulted student loans, and my previous repo of the car, and because of the way I'm constantly running late on pretty much everything.


What should I do?  Specifically about my junk PoS car, but generally in a broad sense.  Would one of those debt consolidation companies be able to help me?  Should I file bankruptcy?


This is a bit of a wildcard, but I have been considering joining the military, mainly for the education benefits, so that I can get out of this rut of being stuck in the restaurant industry.  However, as dumb as this sounds, the military actually looks at your credit history when considering if you are eligible to join or not.  My credit is BAD as it is, I'm afraid of ruining it further with something like a repo or a bankruptcy.  I'm not 100% dead set on going military, but I'd like for it to remain an option.

So I'm creating a gimmicky budget, and I need some help. 

Here's the plan: 17% of my net-pay (after taxes, and 10% towards my thrift savings account) goes towards savings, 4% towards long-term spending (clothings, electronics, etc.), 3% towards trips, and 2% towards car maintenance. The remaining portion, 74% of my net pay goes towards my living expenses: My defined expenses (bills), and my variable expenses ($40 per week for 'walking around' money). 

I have dedicated accounts with USAA for all of my categories (my employer has a 'financial allotment' feature that I can use to direct money to specific accounts), so a lot of my bi-weekly money will be diverted to their designated accounts before I even have a chance to access it. My end goal is to compartmentalize everything, so that what money I have left is the only thing I can 'overspend' on, and I don't deplete a dedicated account unless it's going to be used for that purpose (not going to take $100 out of my 'trips' account to buy a pair of shoes, for instance). 

Am I going about this the right way, or is there a simpler way? 

My long-term plan is to cut down on my 'overhead'/living expenses (~$1,850 for everything, in Atlanta; would like to get that below ~$1,200). But for right now, my main goal is to live within a budget, and stick to it. Any future pay raise will go towards my thrift savings account, or general savings account.

I got quite a lot of feedback, a portion of it positive, from that and I figure I might want to do something similar. I absolutely love statistics, and over the summer I learned a **lot** about the pitfalls I ran into doing the last survey and analysis. I really want this survey to be at least as large as the last one, and hopefully we can all learn a little about how redditors generally keep themselves financially. Unlike last thread, though, I won't be accepting answers from inside the thread because the survey is a little long for that.

I am doing this out of my own personal enjoyment, this isn't for homework and I'm not getting compensated at all. If anything, I'm doing this for personal education and getting better at using SAS for large data files. I have a few questions in mind  for the analysis but if you see two questions you'd like to see correlations on or anything like that please post here and let me know and I'll be sure to include it in my analysis post in a week or so.

So if you'd like to help, please go to the following link and answer all the questions. It's about 15 questions, then a agree/disagree grid of 15 statements. It should only take a few minutes and every response makes a world of difference to me, personally.

Also, my wife is traveling, so I quickly paid off the card and told her to use a backup.  I called the student loan servicer and they said there is nothing to do but dispute the item and then wait 5 days.

My Army retirement is roughly $2500 (net) per month.  I have no debt and no house.  I started a Roth IRA in '98 and it currently has around $60,000 in it.  My savings account has a little over 100k.  I have health insurance (from Military).

I would like to retire early -- maybe in 11 years.  I just took a job that seems steady and pays about 80K a year.  They offer a 401K and match 50% up to 6% annual.  But if I want to retire at 50 is this really the best option for me?

I'm confused about buying a house.  I live by myself and don't really need a house.

My take home is roughly 7K a month (includes Army pay) and I only need about 2K to cover my living expenses.

So what should I do with that other 5K per month? And should I buy a house if I don't need one or continue to rent?

I know some will say, well if your living expenses is only 2K and you get 2.5K from the Army -- why not retire now?

A: I don't know, I guess I'm not ready to stop working.  I would like a little more in savings so that when I retire again at 50 I can pull 80K per year without working, then I could travel more, etc.  Feasible?

I've been heavily lurking /r/personalfinance as well as reading a few books, trying to do everything I can to set up a savings plan with the newfound paycheck before it gets here.  Don't have the complete picture yet, but my job offers excellent 401k matching and a few relatively safe stock options (significant member of the S&amp;P index) so I'll probably start there once the emergency fund is complete.

The question isn't about that plan; it's about why do YOU invest?  There is so much talk of how to save, but not much with regard to WHY to save (other than the obvious emergency fund reasoning).  My personal plans are a bit shorter term and seem frivolous compared to the weighty all-encompassing ""retirement"" phrase that seems to be the common answer to this question.  

Put it this way..  As someone pretty into weightlifting/fitness, I am very goal oriented, and have so far been the same about savings.  For example, I *will* buy a luxury/sports car someday.  For me, putting a picture of a Porsche above my desk is a much better motivator than a vague ""comfortable retirement"" idea.  Is this the wrong way to go about it?

Edit: Thanks for all the fantastic responses!  For people who find this thread down the road, common answers seem to be ability to maintain a lifestyle, buy what you want when you want it, just generally not worry about paycheck-to-paycheck living or insurmountable debt.

I love reading PF. I think it's given me a bit more of a grasp on how personal finance works.... but as you can see I'm not doing so great.

I was lucky enough to have parents who paid my way through college. I spent the following year doing Americorps (earning $800/month, not allowed to have other employment. Any savings I did have went out the window ( :( ). But I did get an education stipend that I paid to my parents. Anyway, long story short, I've got no savings.

Now I'm working in the non-profit field (which has always been my plan). I'm making $15/hr with no overtime, which comes out to about 32k before taxes. After finishing Americorps, my salary essentially tripled, but I still haven't saved. Partially it was because I had some necessities I needed to buy, but mostly it's because I'm not budgeting as well as I could be.

Anyway, my plan now is to try and put $100/paycheck in savings. I know I need to build credit somehow-- is getting a credit card and just using it for gas a good idea?

My expenses are:

rent: 425/mo (includes utilities)


internet: 18/mo 


gym membership: 129/mo (I know)


gas: 100/mo


also pay $50-100/mo to my boyfriend for payments on furniture he bought for our apartment (so technically I guess this would be debt, though it's not in my name). This will be paid off in december.

I own a 2004 hyundai santa fe that is in good condition (and owned in full), but I have no funds available for repairs-- how much should I have put aside?

I know I can be doing better-- I know that I'm lucky to live in an inexpensive part of the country with no debt on this kind of salary, but I want to take advantage of that luck instead of spending frivolously.

I'm really bad at it. I don't pay attention to price, I just grab whatever is there and go. And when it comes to food, it's even worse. Not knowing how to cook makes it difficult, but I spend $50 in food (microwave meals, cereal, milk, things that don't take much to put together) and in three days it's all gone!! 

I work full-time at a grocery store. So, the mindset is always to get *out* as soon as my shift is over. I think this might be why I hate grocery shopping so much. It's really hurting my budget, I can't afford more than $200 a month in groceries and I can't afford to eat out either.

It terrified me because I realize I'm in an even worse situation than this guy.

My fiance and I will have a total of $140,000 in student loan debt by the time he graduates grad school ($110K for him, $30K for me from undergrad). I also have a car loan of $10,000 (needed to do it, our old beater broke a piston on the highway and I needed a reliable vehicle).

Combined, we make about $45,000/year right now. We're getting married in 2014.

Background: he's a musician, I'm a journalist. Right now he is a receptionist at his college and he hopes to get a full-time position there.

I work at a small-town paper, but I'm switching to public radio (better pay). I can foresee us moving up to combined income of $55,000/year by 2015.

We're both very early career (I'm 22, he's 24) and neither of us intends to stay in our current position for more than 18 months.

Both of our jobs offer 401ks, to which we both contribute very minimally (ie: chump change). Is it even worth thinking about retirement at this point? Is buying a home even in the picture within the next 20 years? Would a pre-nup even be worth it when neither of us makes any money?

Sorry this got long and maybe there's no way to help other than to be frugal, make payments on time, and inwardly wish for a giant pile of money to fall out of the sky. It's just depressing to see my net worth on Mint at -$40,000 and only know that it will triple next year.

1354043773.0,57,self.personalfinance,13vygo,[UPDATE] Suddenly inherited a significant amount of money (~$1.75 million) and have no idea what to do.

My initial calculations were incorrect (some accounts ended up being duplicates, some CDs had been cashed, etc.), but from what I can tell, the total will still be significant. After the house is sold (I'm assuming about a 20% decrease from the 2004 purchase price) I believe I should see somewhere between $1.3 million and $1.5 million before taxes.

I should first point out that, other than my lawyer, I have told no one about the financial situation. Some close family is aware that the house has no mortgage, and they can assume how much it's worth, they have no idea of the rest. The fact that I received about 10 PMs from people asking for money is a good indication that I should tell no one about this.

I've also been doing some research on fee-based financial advisors and plan to see if I can have a free initial consultation with a few of them to see who is the best fit for me since I assume I will have to deal with this person on a regular basis for quite some time (hopefully). I also will begin looking into an accountant, though I'm not sure how necessary that is at this point (advice on this is welcomed).

Since no one knows my situation, I have made promises to no one. However, before the end of the year, I plan to take advantage of the $13,000 gift-tax exemption for a few close family members (as I noted in my previous post, if I had not been around, the estate would have been left to these people, so I feel this is the right thing to do).

I plan on making no big purchases or decisions (other than some potential investing based on suggestions from my financial advisor) for about a year. Of the total inheritance, so far I have placed about 2% into a checking account that I will use to pay for costs that have accrued with the funeral and which will be used to pay bills related to the estate.

The only big ""purchase"" that I will make is a car. I already had a car and now was left another in the will. Both cars are less than 5 years old, but I have no need for two of them. My plan is to potentially trade-in both for a new vehicle that handles well in winter weather. I expect that I probably won't need to spend any money toward a new vehicle when combining both existing cars.

What do I do?,72,18,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zh5ss/ca_i_recently_discovered_that_a_bill_for_an_alarm/,"Details:  

I'm a young professional, 27 years old with impeccable credit history.  I have never been late on any bills or had anything sent to collections previously.  I recently went through a divorce resulting from my ex-wife cheating.  The ex-wife in the split kept the house and agreed to take on any joint liabilities.  However, there has been this long standing refusal for her to pay for monitoring of the alarm system.  It was locked into a contract until July 2012.  In January 2012, I cancelled the account, caught up any outstanding balances so they wouldn't go to collections and asked them to contact me if there was a payout penalty and I would pay it.  

After a few months I started getting calls from a number that I didn't recognize and I let it go to voice mail.  The voice mails that were left were very generic, and stated that ""you have an important message from [first word of company name], press one to speak to an agent.""  I assumed this was just telemarketing and as I was expecting my account was caught up, did not expect any kind of collection agency to try to contact me.  

In any case, I picked up a call at random on Monday to find out it was a collection agency and I was completely floored.  I had no idea that this was even an issue.  I paid the bill immediately, so it will move to ""paid in full"" on my credit report. 

How badly will a ""paid in full"" collections affect my credit rating and future prospects of lending?  Should I dispute the alarm system item on my credit report saying the debt was not mine (divorce) / I was never formally contacted by an agent?  Have I shot myself in the foot for the next 7 years?

I'm incredibly upset.  I had excellent credit before this stupid $180 and am now caught in what I wanted to avoid in the first place by paying the damn thing.

Let's call them BW, and the other partner SO. They have a long-term relationship (5+ years, unmarried), stable, living in the same home, one person (BW) runs a business, the other (SO) keeps house, deals with finances, groceries, cleaning, and makes a little bit of pocket money from helping out the business too. Looking for easy way to manage accounts/funds.

**Spending:** By default, BW currently pays for the big (shared) stuff, and most other stuff. No issue there. Neither party has significant spending issues - no big worries that one will be overspending versus the other. Finances are a it disorganized, though - would be nice to have 'regular bills' and maybe 'staples' paid from one account/card, and 'BW recreation' and/ or 'SO recreation' elsewhere.

**Question:** practically speaking, what is the best way to give equal access to necessary day-to-day funds? Create a single joint-checking account that remains 'topped off' enough to function continuously? Dump money into another account periodically for SO? Have BW simply auto-pay a credit card held in the name of SO to keep their credit separate, but have credit-like flexibility? [No debt on card, regardless - just card-as-tool]

**Concerns:** there is no big trust issue here per se, but of course the ideal solution stops slightly short of 'give everyone access to everything'. There is also, as mentioned, no real spending issue, though being able to track each person's purchases (as in: each checking their own, not nitpicking the other), roughly, would be nice (e.g. two accounts or two cards or something).

Strange then, that they would want to charge $200 a year for me to have a card, considering they spent so much time/money trying to force me to take one out.

Anyway, as the renewal approaches, a friend advised me to call up and cancel the card.

Since they are so, so desperate for me to have a card, they willt ry anything to make me keep it.

So I play the motions like i really want to cancel the card..

Result?

Fee waived for the year ($200ish) and an increased credit limit.

The alternative was to cancel the card, then have another salesperson chase me, set up meetings etc, then pay have the bank pay him/her comission once I choose to take out a card, plus the cost of generating a new card, and postage, etc...

Cancelling a card, then taking out a new one, would actually cost the bank money.

I have recently realized that my father has been utterly irresponsible financially. My parents immigrated from Korea 20 years ago, and my mother still has not been able to become fluent in English. Over these years, my father has managed to manipulate her in every fashion, including the creation of a mortgage under her name as well as thousands of dollars in credit card debt (without her consent). My mother only recently became aware of the situation because of the letters for foreclosure and visits from representatives of the bank. I have limited knowledge about our finances, but I am sure that we are most definitely losing our house.

Because of their limited English, the burden of the failing business has fallen upon the shoulders of me and my two brothers. There really is no hope for us financially. You might wonder how my mother has been so ignorant all of these years. Unfortunately, the answer to that would be the physical and verbal abuse on behalf of my father. It has all been very stressful, and the environment at home has definitely taken a toll on every member of my family. I personally have had so much emotional baggage and I have always felt responsible for my negligent parents. At this point, I don't know a thing about finance.

I know my father has already wrecked irreparable havoc on my mother's financial state, and I only see the circumstances getting worse as they are unable to keep up with the bleeding business, the bills, etc. My question is, what can I do? It all seems so hopeless. My father disabled the ringing on our phone because the credit card companies were incessantly calling.

I am 23 years old and always very conscience about retirement. I am always very concerned on making the right moves to be financially stable when I am older. I would definitely like to retire before the age of 60.

My Background:

Making about $70k a year.

Contributing 5k a year into a ROTH. Actively managing my investments. Currently all are in dividend stocks set up with DRIP's. 

Company match 401k is 6%. Dollar for dollar for the first 3% and 50 cents on the dollar for the next 3%. I am contributing 6% to take advantage of the full match.

I put about $200 a month into my trading account and do some swing/day trading when I have time.

I am saving about $500 a month into my savings account for emergencies.

I have some school loan debt and that's it.

I have been thinking about purchasing an investment property but I would need to find the right partner in my area.

Basically my question is, if you had to go back to being 20 years old and do it all again...what would you do?

Thanks for all your help!

**EDIT:**

I want to thank you all for a lot of great responses! Here's what I've gathered so far:

- Max out ROTH IRA at 5k a year
- Max out 401k
- Save 12-15k for emergency fund and place it in a savings account to hopefully earn some interest
- Take care of your teeth! Dental care is expensive
- Invest and take advantage of compound interest
- When you have kids, start a 529 plan for them for college

(Nearly 50K in all!) 

My lifestyle in SoCal was definitely **far beyond** what I was making at the time and it caught up to me quickly during late 2010. I've never missed a payment, but my CC utilization hit 100% during the early part of 2011; thus that was finally a wake up call to get my finances straight. Here are some of the steps I've taken so far:

* Moved from San Diego to Phoenix during June 2011, cut cost of living expenses down dramatically. Rent / utilities alone dropped from about $1200 a month down to $500 a month. (Roommates)
* Picked up a second part time job during September 2011. Bumps yearly salary from 42K to about 54K (pre-tax). 
* Shifted from State Farm Car Insurance to Progressive, dropped from $1200 a year to $700 a year. (Got my full 30% discount with Snapshot.)
* Cut the Cord and shifted only to Hulu Plus / Netflix ($16 a month). Internet included in apartment rent.
* Suffered an expensive setback during September with $3500 for short hospital stay (all better now), but paid off all bills related to that expense.
* Shifted about $12.5K of CC debt to 0% interest cards through January 2013. Paid off about $4K of CC debt, $5K of car debt and $1K of student loan debt over the year.

My goal for 2012 is to continue looking for new cuts in my budget and pay off more debt over the next twelve months in this order:

* CC 1: $2,800 (16% APR) 
* CC 2: $2,300 (10%) 
* Car loan: $8,200 (8%) 
* Student Loan: $5,000 (3.6%) 
* CC 3-5: $12,700 (0%)

* Total Current Debt **$31,000**

She had read an article about a women whose husband died and she didn't know what to do.

My wife wanted me to quiz her on our finances and we found out she had a lot to learn.  I've used Mint for years and always gave her to logon.  She is a joint account holder for all of our cards/accounts. I also prepare a financial summary sheet at the end of the year to review.

Despite that, we realized that if I died or became incapacitated she would have a difficult time figuring out which bill she needed to pay. Unfortunately, she doesn't deal with the bills on a daily basis so of course she will forget.  

So now I am making a summary cheat sheet.  I'm going to put each account, logon info, and summary of what we do with it.

It is time consuming and will need to be maintained but it is for the best.  I just hope the rest of you are keeping someone else in the loop.  I realized this document will also go with our will in case we both die and someone needs to take care of your estate or kids.

1352697295.0,51,self.personalfinance,131s10,"Help me Reddit - you're my only hope! Are my parents idiots? About to refinance a 2nd mortgage on THURSDAY, if they pay $12K cash (new loan will be for $28K over 7 years at a 5.5% fixed rate). 1st mortgage in good standing with a $35K balance at variable + 2%). Just found out and I'm freaking!",73,22,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/131s10/help_me_reddit_youre_my_only_hope_are_my_parents/,"Title is quick summary. I just got a cursory look at the contracts 20 minutes ago. My mind is reeling. I'm thinking they're about to hand over $12K for a horrible ROI - that it would be better to declare bankruptcy, which will delay the foreclosure (and being out on the street), close the business (it's unsuccessful), while they sell assets (this is tricky, but craigslist and cash sales are a way to do it?) and try and regroup and move on to a new life based on my dads salary alone. Cut the albatross loose! Here's the long:

Mom is bad with money and math. She has a small business and they live on site. It's a 3 unit building plus 1/2 acre land. 1 office, 2 apartments, she uses both 1bdrm apartments to ""live/work"" within. Rest of land is used in agriculture/greenhouse/nursery retail operation. Value $75-90K on a good day. We've tried to sell it via craigslist, but no one is buying the established business, or leasing it. Might be able to scrape $10K by selling off all the assets on land (greenhouse structures, plant inventory, drip system, computers, etc), it likely has a higher valuation but holding out for more $ isn't a gamble they can take considering the time line. They have $10K cash in hand. That's it. Dad has a decent paying job for the area ($50K/yr). His extra money floats her small business expenses. She has never made profit in 20 years of operation. Their AGI for IRS is $12K/yr, filing jointly. They live in poverty, but don't see it that way. I'm okay with living in poverty as long as they're happy, but I'm horrendously worried that they're about to get screwed by their banking institution and they're bad enough with their finances to let it happen again. Having $10K in hand is a rarity, and only due to a windfall inheritance. 

They have $60K in other debts from the business and personal combined, including tax liens on the property (at least $7K+ in liens). The paid the 1st mortgage on time, but the 2nd mortgage my mom just... didn't pay. -sighs- The 2nd mortgage term expired with a remaining sum of $36K balance on an original $50K loan. The 1st mortgage has a remaining balance of $35K on an original loan of $75K and is on track to be paid off on time. The other tax liens are at least $7K. Again, the value of the property is maybe $90K on a good day.

The 2nd mortgage was ""called"" and mom couldn't pay $36K. She didn't do anything. Didn't tell us for 3 months, while she looked for ""other financing options"". Then she get a notice that the bank will foreclose. Mom and dad went to the bank and said ""we have $10K we can give you if you give us 5 more years to pay off that 2nd mortgage."" The bank said ""okay"". However, not in writing. Then the banker they were working with ""quit"" and a new banker came on to the scene. This banker says ""okay, i'll give you 7 years to pay it, for 1% more interest."" Mom and dad say ""okay"". Then the banker says, ""wait. we see you have at least $7K in tax liens here. We need another $2K for fees and interest. Pay us $12K and we'll give you a new 2nd mortgage."" This new 2nd mortgage will take the original outstanding debt on the now 'called loan' from $36K to $28K (approximately) - even though they are paying $12K. They don't really have $12K to pay. They close this Thursday. I read through the lien and collateral notice, and it is a waaaay more complicated document then the original one they signed - it includes wording such as ""if a new lien is placed on the property you have 15 days to discharge it, or the lender can claim loss on their security"" or ""lender must be notified of any insurance payments (regarding damage from wind/fire/etc) within 15 days of causality, and has the right to intercede all payments and apply to indebtedness or to fix claim"". The deed also says the lender has the right of ""sale"" - which makes me think they can sell the property whether mom and dad are in default or not on the 2nd mortgage. The issue about paying off any new liens within 15 days also has me worried, knowing their tax history (mom likes to make payments and budgets her life around payments, vs indebtedness).

What would you do? What details can I share that make this complicated financial scenario easier to solve for the betterment of my parents? I'm lucky and frugal and not in a position to give them $ to solve their problems, but I'm on my way up - own my own business, and I don't take dumb risks. They're 60 years old each and their sacrifices and dumb financial decisions gave me the education that's helped me get where I am today (the $60K PLUS loan they took out is now at $110K... they didn't know what they were signing up for, I didn't either, I was just a kid.). I love them. They are kind, honest, and gullible people. If they are homeless, they will live with me, until they get on their feet again. But man, are they idiots, or what? Am I being too harsh? Do I let them loose the $10K they have in hand, to the bank, in this 'vain hope' (my current perception) that they get to keep their property and in 5 or 10 years sell it for $120K or sell the business for $250K and use that to retire, or in 7 years, when dad retires from his current job, they still have their land and mom's business, and he can work it as supplementary income to his social security check (this is something they've talked to me about as a hope)?

TL:DR Beloved parents have to pay $12K to get a NEW 2nd mortgage in the amount of $28K spread out over 7 years (fixed 5.5% APR) to keep their current home and small business going (after defaulting on the original 2nd mortgage of $50K w/variable 2% above prime - unpaid balance was $36K). The biz is a failure, the property is worth maybe $90K on a good day. The 1st mortgage has $35K balance with a variable interest rate (2% above prime) and 5 years left to pay it and is current. The 2nd mortgage has some crazy 'you're screwed' terms. I think parents should declare bankruptcy, which delays the foreclosure, get their shit together, sell what they can as quietly as they can, and start fresh on my dads salary of $50K/year (due to mom's failing biz, their AGI is $12K/yr). They close on the 2nd mortgage THURSDAY. I'm terrified. Just found out.
