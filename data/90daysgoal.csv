As usual the beginning of a round is a bit messy due to the amount of new users. We used to have one introduction post instead of many by every user but it feels good to have this kind of activity again (experience tells me that the beginning of a round is the time where most people are active and the drop out rate is still low). I will start an [official one](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/krltx/intro_official_introduction_post/) and we will see if we can clear up our frontpage again.

You will be able to find the important posts in the list on the right side. We have some plans to keep you all motivated which, like the last round, will include a group system, daily posts and this time a buddy system, but as it is with every round we will keep it slow and the first days are mostly about explaining what this is about, setting a goal, fitness, diet etc. So to those already asking for fitnessbuddies, workout routines, grouping, we will get there I'll have to ask you to be a bit patient by now.

So today we will be speaking about 90dg as well as setting goals. And for the rest of this post I will be shamelessly stealing from Katie's (hey there!) excellent round 4 introduction post.

**How does 90days work?**

90days is a tool for motivation and accountability. Every day, we'll start off with a daily goal post where you can check in with your plans and goals for the day, or your successes or setbacks from the day before. Some people have very quick goal posts, others are more detailed and structured. Write as much or as little as you want. Write daily, weekly, or just read other 90ers' updates for motivation.

Every week we'll have a check-in form. The link will be posted on Monday and it will be stickied to the sidebar. If you signed up for email reminders, I'll send you an email with the check-in link on Monday. Please let me know if you ever want me to stop sending emails. The information from the check-in form will be used to gather our group statistics. How much weight do we lose/gain as a group each week?

~~If you signed up for weekly emails and monthly or end-of-round PMs, the email will trump the PM. So if I have your email address, but you asked for a monthly PM reminder, by default I'll send the monthly reminder as an email, not a PM. Sending PMs takes way more time, so I'd like to limit it to the 90ers who didn't want to give out an email address. If you still want the monthly or end-of-round reminders as PM, let me know and I'll make sure you stay on the PM list.~~ [My mistake, no PM reminders this round]

**How should I get started?**

I think the single most important thing for everyone to do today is to write down a list of your short-term and long-term goals. You can start with the easy things, like what weight or body fat percentage you'd like to reach by the end of 90 days, a year, and in the long term. But a longer, more detailed and emotional list will give you more motivation to stick with this. If you aren't sure what your goals are, or if your only goal is to lose/gain weight, take today to put together a more complete list. [Here are two good posts to help your set your goals.](http://90daysgoal.com/getting-started/setting-goals)

We'll work on our diet and exercise routines tomorrow, but for today, let's just write down our goals. Feel free to post them here if you'd like, but since your goals may be emotionally charged, you won't necessarily want to share them with everyone on the internet. By the end of the day, I hope everyone will have a physical list of their goals somewhere. Keep it by your bed, on your fridge, locked in a journal, or right in your wallet. Write it down and look at it as often as you can.

Also, if you haven't already done so, make sure to [fill out the sign up form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFRfR0RTZUx4eUtkSWoxalNGOUxsWUE6MA#gid=10) and feel free [to introduce yourself and meet your fellow 90ers](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/krltx/intro_official_introduction_post/).

If you're not sure what to do, ask! You can ask here, start a thread, message the mods, or PM another 90er.

So let's get started! What are your plans and goals for today? for the round? long term?

I know that lots of people are probably just in this sub for health reasons, and don't really use reddit much otherwise. But, lately I've been browsing reddit, and suddenly remember that it's time to post goals for the day, check-in, or whatever. So, I was thinking it would be great if these /r/90daysgoal posts actually showed up on my front page, motivating us all (okay, maybe not those of you who don't reddit much) to be more active in this community!

So, I propose that we all **upvote** daily goal posts, or at least weekly recap threads, to boost them up closer to the front page.

**We should upvote /r/90daysgoal posts to get them to the front page, and motivate yourself/others to be active here!**

Seeing the pattern emerge over the last few days (plus probably even worse in those who didn't post!), made me think and write this, which I hope is useful to you.


If you're feeling dispirited, if you're bored of exercise, if you miss your old lifestyle or food, **you're not alone.  We all do.**  It's been 2 weeks now, the novelty has worn off, the excitement has gone, and some people have fallen off the wagon.  (With St Patricks Day on, I hope some of you did in spectacular fashion)


I'm here to say, that's okay, and you can recover.


Getting fit isn't about hitting a quota, or a schedule.  It's not something you can mess up so bad you can't recover.  It's a collection of small and large changes to your lifestyle, which have a gradual effect.  If you get sick for 3 days, or you cave in and eat cheeseburger smoothies and deepfried pizza, or just get lazy and miss your workouts, that does not stop you working out the next day.  Today.  Now.


Look at what you've done the last 2 weeks.  I've not heard of a single person who hasn't had an improvement, either in their strength, endurance, fitness or weight (up or down as you intend).  Messing up for a few days doesn't change that, you benefit from those improvements every day.  And most importantly, it doesn't make it harder to get back on and do it.


You CAN do it.  You can start again if you like.  Have another first 2 weeks.  The important thing to remember is when you do it, the changes will come.  When you don't, the changes won't come.  So after a bad day or week, you pick yourself up, and you keep going.  If you think ""Oh I may as well give up now"", you couldn't be more wrong - work out today, right now, and you'll be back where you were.


Every single day, you can make a difference and get closer to the goals you want.  It doesn't really matter how far away from them you are, just that you're heading in the right direction.  Keep that up by doing the lifestyle changes you committed to, and you'll see results.  


Good luck, and remember, your body has already shown you what it can do and the changes it can make.  It's like a dog straining on the leash waiting for you to let it run.  All you have to do is have the willpower to go along with that on good days, and pick yourself up on bad days.  You CAN do it.",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,,True,t3_g5yvn,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/g5yvn/motivation_if_youre_having_trouble_with_your/,

Keep in mind this shopping list is for 2 people for 2 weeks, so you could make it for 1 person for 4 weeks, or cut it in half and have 2 good weeks of groceries.

Also, there are some ingredients needed for recipes that we didn't buy, because we already had some at home, left over from previous shopping trips.  The amount we spend every 2 weeks on groceries varies, but it breaks down to between $3 and $6 per person, per day.  This week was $3.83!


Here's literally what we bought:

2lbs turkey, 97/3.  For:  pasta and manwich

1 grapefruit  For:  snack

1 bag yellow onions  For:  various cooking things.  You can never have too many onions!

1 mango  For:  snack

2 bananas  For:  snack

2 pineapples  For:  delicious awesome snacks, and I put some on fish while I bake the fillets

1 green onion  For:  veggie soup

1 pk romaine hearts  For:  salads

1 pk baby spinach  For:  salads

1 yellow bell pepper  For:  pita pizza

1 green bell pepper  For:  pita pizza

1 red onion  For:  pita pizza and salads

3 tangerines  For:  snack

1 pk cilantro  For:  veggie soup

1 pk celery  For:  veggie soup

1 pk whole carrots  For:  veggie soup

1 cucumber  For:  salads

3 zucchini  For:  veggie soup

3lbs grapes (we both LOVE grapes)  For:  snacks

1 pk cherry tomato  For:  salads

1lbs bag frozen peas  For:  stir fry

3 1lbs bag frozen Stir Fry vegetable mix  For:  stir fry

1 bag frozen broccoli  For:  stir fry

1 bag frozen blueberries  For:  morning protein shakes

1 bag frozen strawberries  For:  morning protein shakes

1 2cup bag shredded mozzarella  For:  pita pizza

1 pk cheese slices  For:  sandwiches

1 pk deli turkey  For:  sandwiches

1 carton silk milk  For:  morning protein shakes

1 pint ice cream  For:  Boyfriend's sweet tooth

1 pk sour cream  For:  chicken wraps

1 pk popcorn (100 cal packs)  For:  snacks

1 box whole wheat rotini  For:  pasta

1 jug diet cranberry juice  For:  snacks

6 cans chicken broth  For:  veggie soup

2 cans tomato sauce  For:  veggie soup

2 cans tomato paste  For:  manwich

1 can corn  For:  veggie soup

1 can green beans  For:  veggie soup

2 cans refried beans  For:  chicken wraps

1 loaf bread  For:  sandwiches

1 pack of whole wheat pita bread  For:  pita pizza, manwich



Here are our basic meals

**Breakfast**:  protein shake for me.  Boyfriend usually has breakfast at work

**Lunch**:  Sandwich OR salad WITH soup, and a cheese stick.  We already have enough cheese sticks at home, so they weren't on this list.  I make a different soup every 2 or 3 weeks.  This time it's Veggie Soup.

**Dinner**: 
Stir Fry twice a week (usually I make a double batch on Mondays, because I'm too busy on Tuesdays to cook)
Pita pizza

Manwich(note)

Chicken Wrap

Pasta (note)

[Cheat Meal]  Once a week we go out to dinner, which is why there are only 6 dinners listed.

**Snacks**:  we have fruit, baby carrots, popcorn, turkey jerky, and juice for snacks at work, after dinner, or on the weekends.  It's good, for me, to have fruit around for when I want something sweet.

&gt; (Note) My boyfriend has recently gotten bored of the SAME dinners over the last 3 months, so I changed up our options a bit.  I wanted to keep the easiest/healthiest meals, but I added Manwich (a friends recipe) and pasta (lean portion with a salad).  I subbed the new meals for the Big Three we used to have, which is:  A lean cut of meat (fish fillet, porkchop, chicken breast), veggies, and 1/2 cup rice.

Todays topic is diets but before we start a little history lesson about r/90daysgoal and the philosphy behind it. It all started with the premise of a single user that he can transform us in 90 days. It started promissing as that user posted a lot of information until someone pointed out that it looked awfully like another fitness programm. Someone said ""copyright"" and suddenly that user was deleted, never to be heard of again. What then happened was amazing. The community full of non-fitness persons stepped up and said ""screw this, we will do this anyway"". That was 4 rounds and more than a year ago. Not much has changed. This is not a set fitness programm, we don't tell you what to do. This is entirely community driven and self depended which means you decide how you diet and workout and we all as a community try to help you on your way. Community in this subreddit is a bit different than in other reddits, for once this is all time dependent (90 days) and completely based on how much you are willing to work. Inevitable that means we start with a large new userbase every 90 days that slowly shrinks until there is another userbase for the next 90 days (in the best case scenario people stay). The challenge for the mods is to make it work and to form a community. In general this means we want you to talk a lot here, rather more than less. Write about yourself, ask questions, but also answer questions, read other peoples experiences and help them out.

Yesterday we talked about the goals, if you had problems setting a goal, ask via comment here, post a new thread (if you get no answer here) or pm a mod, just avoid not talking about it. It would also be nice if people would read through the [introduction thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/krltx/intro_official_introduction_post/) again. Get to know each other and read some profiles (it doesn't hurt to hit on the ""New"" tab) after this week (and after assigning groups and buddies) you will work closer together.

Understand the first daily goals as discussion topics to send you on your journey (and to help other people on theirs). This week we will talk about workouts as well as assigning groups and buddies. If you ever feel we are moving too fast, or that you don't understand a topic, tell us.

There are 2 things I would have talked about on a later date, but as they are somehow official and help you on your way, we can get this out of the way now.

**1) Fitocracy**

[Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/) is a workout tracker that treads working out like a game, with points, challenges and achievements. It is addictive, teaches you something about different workouts, it has its own 90dg group and we will have our own challenges there. I highly recommend it. Fitocracy is still in its beta phase though, which means you need invitations to join. More in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/krb68/1000_fitocracy_invites/) thread. If you join, also join [our group](http://www.fitocracy.com/group/17/).

**2) IRC**

We have our own [IRC channel](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/g14gc/community_irc_chat_for_90daysgoal/), so if you want to chat with fellow 90dg members, feel free to join. If you have problems connecting, send me a PM.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Now on with the original topic, diets. Again stealing from #4 excellent introduction post:

We have people following all kinds of diets here, so I'll try to keep this reasonably general. Here are a couple things that I've picked up over the last few rounds:

* Don't diet, change your eating habits. Figure out your weaknesses and try to tackle those this round. Do you eat a whole bag of candy before you realize it's gone? Do you have big weekend binges after a week of healthy eating? Does drinking make you eat more? Do you tend to eat late at night? Do you eat when you're bored/stressed/alone/with friends? Do salty snacks make you crave more salty things? Do sugary snacks make you crave more sugary things? Figure out your triggers and try to recognize your old habits before you fall into them.

* Listen to your body. Lots of people end up eating too little when they're trying to lose weight. If you're feeling drained or moody, it might be because you aren't giving your body enough fuel. That doesn't mean you should blindly start eating more though. No matter what diet you're following, I think it's useful for everyone to calculate their BMR and target calories for the weight loss rate they'd like to reach. (There's more info about this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/e6zf6/90dg_day_2_what_should_i_eat/).)Then, without changing your diet, try tracking everything that you eat, every day, for a week or so. MyFitnessPal, LiveStrong, LoseIt, or other similar sites should be pretty useful here. How close do you get to your target calories? If you're way below, add in some fruits and veggies and other small snacks to round out your day. If you're way over, maybe look for some alternatives to some of the biggest contributors.

* Don't deprive yourself, strive for moderation. Swearing off french fries or ice cream for the rest of your life is... mind boggling. I don't think I could do it. Eating enormous portions of fries and ice cream on a splurge day because you haven't had them in forever isn't a great idea either though. Work toward a middle road. Maybe allow yourself a small splurge once a month. Try to stick to a single serving and really savor it.

* You can lose weight and still drink alcohol. You'll have to be pretty good about it. Make some food compromises, watch what you're eating the rest of the day, aim for moderation, and savor every sip. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on alcohol might be an easy way to push through it.

* You can lose weight and still eat bread/pasta/potatoes/rice/sweets. Again, you'll just have to be good about it. Small servings of starchy/carby foods aren't going to derail your progress. But if your day consists of a bagel, a sandwich with potato chips, and pasta with a baked potato and a piece of pie, you might want to consider scaling back on the carbs and adding a lot of fruits and veggies. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on carbs might be an easy way to push through it.

* A specific diet might work for lots of people, but that doesn't mean it will work for you. Try it out, see how you feel, see how your weight responds, gauge how hard it will be for you to keep it up long-term. If it doesn't seem to be working for you, try to figure out which part seems to be the problem.

* The end goal is a long-term, sustainable change to our eating habits. Quick weight loss has a pretty high relapse rate. If you're nearing your long-term weight goals, start setting out a maintenance plan for yourself. Don't let yourself slip back into old bad habits. Keep an eye on your weight. Set an alarm weight for yourself, probably 5-10 lbs above your long-term goal weight. If you ever go above that weight, it's time to re-examine your eating habits and make sure you're still following your maintenance plan.

Ok, so now for the daily goals!

What's your plan for your diet this round? Do you have any questions about which diet to follow? Any questions about the diet you're already following? Are you using any websites or apps to help you keep up with your plans?

Do you have any general dieting tips that you've picked up during your journey? Anything you've read or learned the hard way?

And finally, how did things go yesterday? What are your goals and plans for today?

Good luck with your goals today!

We’ve made it through the first week of our 90 days together, and it’s time for our first check-in!

Here’s all you have to do:

* [Fill out this form](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dGhJd05ZVEhZZVFZRm1FZ3VUZmpKS3c6MQ#gid=1) with as much information as you can. You are checking in for **WEEK 1**.

* You must check in with at least your weight. All other items are optional. Your weight is not the best indicator of your progress though, and you’re encouraged to keep track of your other measurements. Plus, the more information we gather from each person, the more fun stats we can post about us as a group. But if it’s overwhelming to take so many measurements every week, then at the very least keep checking in with your weight.

* If you choose to track your exercise and calories, count everything between Monday, Feb 28 and Sunday, Mar 6.

* Check back later this week to see our group stats.

If you don’t check in:

* Ooh, don’t make me kick your butt. [Check in now!](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dGhJd05ZVEhZZVFZRm1FZ3VUZmpKS3c6MQ#gid=1)

* If you signed up for a butt kicking and you don’t check in, Gingryu and I will have the honor of kicking your butt in the form of a PM reminder to fill out the form.

* Since more than 700 people signed up for this, [please go fill out the form now](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dGhJd05ZVEhZZVFZRm1FZ3VUZmpKS3c6MQ#gid=1)! Otherwise we’ll be devoting our entire day to kicking butts, and I know you don’t want to make us do that :)

* If you get a PM but you didn’t want one, let us know and we’ll take you off the list. If you didn’t get a PM but you did want one, let us know and we’ll add you to the list.

Other things to remember:

* It’s only been a week. Don’t get discouraged if you haven’t seen any changes yet. Keep up your hard work, keep checking in, and the changes will come.

* Take progress pictures every few weeks. If you haven’t taken your “before” pictures, now is as good a time as any. You might not want to take them now, but you will really, really appreciate having these “before” pictures when you’re further into your transformation.

* Update your calorie target. If your weight or body composition has changed already, make sure to recalculate your calorie goals. ",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,self1,True,t3_fywxv,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/fywxv/checkin_monday_07_mar_2011_first_weekly_checkin/,moderator

* If you haven't already done so, please subscribe to 90daysgoal by clicking the green ""+frontpage"" button on the sidebar. Also, fill out your stats in the [sign-up form](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&amp;formkey=dFFMMmhxem9SQ3ZXTjFBQ2lOdFYtM1E6MA#gid=2). If you aren't sure what to set for your weight goal, there are a couple suggestions in the ""Where do I want to be?"" section of [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/e6cp3/90dg_day_1_where_are_we_now_and_where_do_we_want/). If you aren't interested in gaining or losing weight, please put your current weight as your goal. If you still have questions, please ask! You can message the mods or start a thread or ask in the daily goal posts.

* There will be a ""Your Daily Goal"" thread (YDG) posted every morning. In these threads, you can talk about your goals, the things you're doing to meet your goals, your progress, setbacks, questions, breakthroughs, or anything else you want to talk about. This is a great place to get motivation, support, and feedback from other 90ers. Everyone is encouraged to read through the posts and comment to others. You might even want to find someone with similar goals to yours and add them as a friend so you can read each other's posts and help each other stay on track. Today's daily goal post is up on the sidebar for quick reference, but it will eventually be easy to pick them out on the front page. 

* Once per week, every Monday, there will be a weekly check-in post with a reminder to weigh yourself and take your other stats. There will be a link to a check-in form. The form will be similar to the sign-up form, but simpler. You can check in with lots of information, or you can check in with just your weight. If you feel yourself losing motivation because you don't want to have to take your body measurements every Monday, then you can skip them. At least check in with your weight though. We will be compiling group statistics and charts each week so we can see how well we're doing as a group. Please, please remember that weight fluctuates a lot. Don't get too caught up in the number. As long as you're working toward your goals, you can pretty much ignore the number. *Please still check in, even if your weight goes up one week.* An increase in weight is not a failure, it's noisy data. Keep working hard, keep coming back, keep checking in, and the results will come. 

* We will be having motivational posts and healthy food posts this round. If you would like to help contribute motivational posts on a semi-regular basis, please message the mods so we can all work together to keep these going! If you have any food tips or healthy recipes, please add them to the themed healthy food posts that pop up! I love getting new recipes, and I know I'm not the only one. :)

* If you have a big question that isn't getting answers in the YDG post, or if you think it might be helpful to others, please start a thread for it! A good example is ""How do I get rid of shin splints?"" Lots of people can benefit from the answer, and it will be easier to search for past advice if it gets its own dedicated thread. [Remember to tag your posts with [QUESTION] or [TIP], etc.](http://redd.it/fuarw)

* Finally, please don't hesitate to message the mods if you have any questions or concerns!

My name is Kerrz. I'm a low-level IT Slave and I'll be turning 29 during the challenge. The biggest thing I need is accountability. So I am trying to make my weight loss goals and progress as public as I can.

Excuses are easy to come by, but excuses don't get the job done. With a past in competitive wrestling, I'm all about meeting deadlines and goals by the most ridiculous means necessary. So having weekly weigh-ins is something that I've really missed since I hung up the boots.

I keep active by biking the 5.3km (3.2mi) to work and/or weight training/cardio at the gym on campus (I work at a college.) I use MyFitnessPal on my phone to track exercise.

I was going great-guns for a couple weeks already, but this past week has been a disaster involving an infected elbow and a trip to the hospital. I caved and went back to a 2500 calorie diet of comfort food. I'm trying to keep it under 2000, and mostly fruits/veggies.

The goal is really just to get that first little bump of ""living healthy"" over and done with, to get into the good habit of living well, but I'm also looking to get back to my competitive weight class (264lbs) as a medium-range goal.

Anyway, to steal a page from Mr_Nox:

I would tend to starve myself all day (with the idea of losing weight) and then gorge myself in whatever I could get at the end of the night. Often, the corner store was my solace.

But, in the last 4 weeks, I've only really gone in there to buy a newspaper, or get a bottle of water.

Tonight I had celebrated with some work friends and decided to go into the corner store to get some coconut water (my #1 tip for a hangover) to have in the morning. As one of the regular checkout guys was ringing me up he said, ""You look a little different."" I was kind of taken aback by his statement and asked him to repeat and indeed I heard him correctly, ""you look a little different.""

I said, ""how do you mean?"" and he said ""you've lost some weight.""

In reality I've lost about 5lbs in the last month but I've had a significant change in the weight I carry in my face over that time, which I guess is what the guy noticed. Since I look at myself each day I haven't noticed the big difference.

So, if you're just starting and don't feel you're making any progress, know that you are. Consider taking photos of yourself every week, or every other week to see your progression.

In the rest of this post, I’m hoping to answer the question *“Where do I start?”* A lot of the material today is summarized from Tom Venuto’s [Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle](http://www.burnthefat.com/) (highly recommended reading). The first section is mostly geared toward weight-loss goals, but if you have non-weight related goals, the goal setting tips in the second section are applicable to all types of goals.

###**Where am I now?**

Before you get started figuring out what you want to change, first figure out exactly where you are. Write down an initial measurement for as many things as you can. Some of the easy ones are your weight, body fat percentage, chest/hips/waist measurements (flexible measuring tapes are cheap, no excuses), max number of push-ups/pull-ups/sit-ups, jogging/biking/swimming distance/speed. Even if you’re not specifically aiming to improve one of these stats, measure it anyway. After 90 days, measure again to see what’s changed.

**Estimate your weight**

One of the *least* important stats to track is your weight. Weight fluctuates a lot, so don’t get too caught up in the number. As long as you’re working toward your goals, you can pretty much ignore the number and focus on your progress in other areas. *An increase in weight is not a failure*, it’s noisy data. Keep working hard, keep coming back, keep checking in, and the results will come. 

That said, weight is easy to measure and if it’s averaged over a large sample of people, it can be a meaningful measure of progress for a group. For those reasons, the weekly check in form will track weight. But again, don’t get too caught up in the number when you check in.

**Estimate your body fat percentage**

One of the *most* important stats to track is your body fat percentage. The weight that you want to work off should be mostly fat, not muscle mass, and the best way to find out if you’re losing fat or muscle is to estimate your body fat percentage. There are lots of ways to get this number. Here are a couple sites to help you find it:

* [Check with your doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage#Measurement_techniques) - these are the most accurate techniques, but they are more difficult to do regularly
* [Calipers or tape measure](http://www.linear-software.com/online.html) - calipers are your best bet for a more accurate home test, the tape measure method is cheap and easy to do on your own
* [Digital scales](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ff&amp;authuser=0#q=body+weight+percentage+scale&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;authuser=0&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=shop&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Gfm7UIKWNIO89QTVuIHoCw&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAA&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=8eaf7385bef36188&amp;bpcl=39314241&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=972) - these can give a wide range of values throughout the day and depending on room conditions, so try to measure in the same way each time
* [Visually](https://awasteofawaist.wordpress.com/2011/03/03/why-body-fat-day-53/) - an easy first approximation, but this might not be all that accurate 

**Keep records, take before shots**

For all of your initial stats, **write them down**. You don’t have to post them here, but have them written down somewhere they'll be easy to find again.
 
Final step: take pictures! If you’re anything like me, you *don’t* want to take before pictures. If you don’t take them now though, you will really regret it when you’ve made an amazing transformation. Here are some examples of the poses that the [P90X program](http://www.reddit.com/r/p90x) recommends: [NSFW] [1](http://screenflicker.com/mike/images/200902-before_after.jpg), [2](http://oi54.tinypic.com/w6ti86.jpg). 

###**Where do I want to be?**

Ok, now that we have very specific, numerical values for where we are now, we can move on to where we want to be. To figure out where we want to be, let’s start setting our goals. Setting goals has been the single most helpful thing that I got from Venuto’s book. Here’s a (long) tl;dr version:

* Make **specific, measurable** goals. Pinpoint the weight or waist size that you want to be. Use the visual body fat percentage site above to get an idea of what body fat percentage you’d like to end up at. 
* **Aim high.** You *can* do this. If you really want to make the change, you will accomplish it. Set your goals where you *want* them, not where you think you’ll be able to reach. (Disclaimer: I’m serious, if you *want* this, you *will* get it, so **make sure your goals are healthy** before you start. Try picking something in the middle of the [“healthy” BMI range](http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/). Although BMI isn’t the best measure of body composition, it gives an okay approximation for how low is too low for most people.
* Have **realistic deadlines**. A reasonable guideline for weight loss is about 1-2 lbs (0.5-1 kg) per week, or about 13-26 lbs (6-12 kg) in 90 days. If you need to lose more than this, great! I’ll be here for the next round, and I hope others will stick around with me! You can set your 90-day goals higher than this, but it will mean lots of hard work on your part and you might risk burning yourself out.
* Write **long-term and short-term** goals. Specifically, Venuto suggests the following six types of goals: **1) ultimate long-term goal, 2) one-year goal, 3) 90-days goal, 4) weekly goals, 5) daily goals, and 6) beating your personal best**. Right now, as you’re reading this, get out some paper or open up Notepad and write out those headers. Then start listing them out. Where do you want to be in 5 years? Next year? At the end of this round of 90days? Your weekly goals will help you to know if you’re on track, and your daily goals will help you to take things one step at a time while forming the habits that you’ll need to reach your goals and maintain your new lifestyle once you’ve reached them. 
* Make your goals emotionally charged. Why do you want to reach those goals? Why is it important that you meet them? If you’re trying to lose weight for external reasons, it might not motivate you as much as something that’s extremely personal to you. Make them *your* goals and know *why* those are your goals.
* If your goals conflict with each other, **prioritize** them. If you want to lose weight and gain muscle, you might need to do this in steps - working off the fat with moderate muscle gains, and then building up the muscle with some weight gain. 
* State your goals as **affirmations**. Specifically, Venuto suggests three things for your affirmations: make them **personal**, write them in the **present tense**, and make them **positive**. “At the end of this round, I am extremely happy that I weigh 150 lbs.” Avoid the future tense and negative statements (“By the end of this round, I will have lost 15 lbs”).
* **Read your goals often!** Write out your goals (for real, write them out now) and read over them often. Read your goals when you wake up or when you check your email. Keep them at the front of your mind. 
* **Believe your goals.** When you reread your goals, believe that they are going to happen. Don’t tell yourself you won’t get there, know that you *will* reach those goals. You *want* to get there, and it *will* happen.
* The last thing Venuto recommends is to **visualize** your goals when you read through them. See yourself at the weight you want to be. Make your pictures as vivid as you can. 

###**Where do I start? / TL;DR**

First step: Figure out where you stand now. Second step: Write down your goals for where you want to be. Third step: Fill out the [signup form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGNSWG9DZWc4Vm16ZF9FU19YaTdzNFE6MQ#gid=0). 

Your goals should get you fired up and ready to go. Once you’ve got your goals written down, keep them somewhere you can see them often. You *really* want these things to happen, you’ve explained *why* you want them to happen, you can *see* them happening, and you know that they *will* happen. That’s a significant first step. 

Once you’ve got them, tell us about your goals for today! Feel free to post your longer term goals too. Ask any questions you have. Answer any questions you’re knowledgeable about. Support and encourage your fellow 90ers!

Goal achievement is all about breaking down the goal into discrete actions with a specified result. Think of a goal as a brick wall. This goal is the result on many individual actions (laying a brick). The goal is also dependent on HOW those individual actions are executed. If you are trying to create a brick wall and you are lazy about the way those bricks are laid, you may end up with a result that is less than satisfactory. 

How do you break those goals down into discrete actions? For me, goal achievement is all about consistency. Consistency comes from daily action. What am I going to do today to achieve my goal? Again, the actions I take today are simply a single brick. I am only concerned about today’s brick. Looking at a huge wall can be intimidating and can make you lose focus. Focus on the brick - focus on today. What are you going to do today to achieve your goals? Let’s look at some examples of daily activities to achieve your goals. 

* Play Hotel California on the Guitar -&gt; Practice for 30 minutes between 7:30 and 8:00 pm. 
* Run a 5k -&gt; Walk for 20 minutes. 
* Lose 10 pounds -&gt; Hit my calorie goal on MyFitnessPal

Alright, we are down to the implementation. Let’s look at the full stack. 

* Physical - maintain a healthy weight, stay fit cardiovascularly, look good, be in the best shape of my life on my 40th birthday.
* Yearly Goal - For 2013, I will participate in 4 different races during the year.
* 90 Day Goal - I will run a 10 mile race on Feb 6, 2013 and finish. 
* Weekly Goal - I need to run three times, an easy run, a long run and a tempo run. 
* Today - I am going to run 3 miles at 10 min/mile. 

...and if I am still encountering mental resistance, I will simply decide that I am going to put on my running clothes and go stand in the driveway. A HUGE part of it is simply getting started and I know that 99.9999% of the time, if I get my running clothes on and stand in the driveway, I will go for a run. 

Some final thoughts on goal achievement. 

* Consistency feeds across your entire life. If you are not ready to commit to something, then don’t commit. It might sound weird, but even simple things - like deciding that I am going to drink a whole glass of water every single morning right when I wake up - REALLY DOES feed into my entire life. If I commit to something so trivial and fail, it affects my consistency across the board. Be diligent about all aspects of your life and be consistent. Hold the line.  

* 80% of success is showing up. If you are scheduled to go to the gym and you really don’t want to go and you think you’ll have a terrible workout, then that’s ok. Go anyway and have the crappiest workout ever. Crappy workouts and maintaining consistency is better than nothing. 

* Every Sunday, sit down and plan your week. Every day. Every activity. Plan out possible interruptions and how you are going to manage them. 

* Every day, look at your weekly plan and plan out your day. Down to the minute. 

* Finally, reread your goals every morning. Remember why you are doing what you are doing today. 

Good luck and see you tomorrow. ",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,,True,t3_143rpz,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/143rpz/goal_setting_goal_achievement_strategies/,

So, for those of you who are new to /r/90daysgoal, welcome! This is the post where you'll be finding your challenges for the week. These will consist of bodyweight exercises, so you can do them where ever, whenever.

In previous rounds, we've posted these challenges every weekday. This time, we're trying a slightly new approach. Instead of getting a new challenge everyday, I'll be posting the week's worth of challenges every Monday. I'm in Europe, so for most of you, this should be up bright and early, for you to check out the week's exercises. So, without further ado:

**Monday:** Push up Challenge! Mondays will be a constant throughout the 90 days. How many push ups can you do, with good form? They can be [wall push ups](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RtM3L00BUU), [knee push ups](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/PectoralSternal/BWPushupKnee.html), [standard push ups](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh00_rniF8E), [one handed](http://www.beastskills.com/one-arm-pushup/)... You get the idea. Do three sets to failure. Each week we'll track our numbers and see how we improve. When you've done your push ups, come and post your numbers.

**Tuesday:** Planks. Similar to the push up challenge, Tuesdays will be plank days. Going forward, we'll throw in plank variations, but this week we'll keep it simple with the [standard plank](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSHjTRCQxIw). How long can you hold it? We'll keep track and see our improvements every week.

**Wednesday:** This week it's [triceps dips](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Triceps/BWBenchDip.html) and [walk up planks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8qOQ85fWNM). Do three sets of each, and check in as you do them.

**Thursday:** [Lunges](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BWLunge.html) and [squats](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BWSquat.html), three sets of each. Check in as you do them, and let us know how many!

**Friday:** [Mountain climbers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyeZM-_VnRc) and [Bicycle crunches](http://www.fitnessfrog.com/exercises/abs/44-bicycle-crunch.html). Three sets of each and check in as you go.

----

There you go, the first week of challenges! Let us know going forward what you think of the new format. If the posts wind up buried by Friday, we can switch back to dailies.

In this post, I’m hoping to answer the question *“Where do I start?”* A lot of the material today is summarized from Tom Venuto’s [Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle](http://www.burnthefat.com/) (highly recommended reading). The first section is mostly geared toward weight-loss goals, but if you have non-weight related goals, the goal setting tips in the second section are applicable to all types of goals.

###**Where am I now?**

Before you get started figuring out what you want to change, first figure out exactly where you are. Write down an initial measurement for as many things as you can. Some of the easy ones are your weight, body fat percentage, chest/hips/waist measurements (flexible measuring tapes are cheap, no excuses), max number of push-ups/pull-ups/sit-ups, jogging/biking/swimming distance/speed. Even if you’re not specifically aiming to improve one of these stats, measure it anyway. After 90 days, measure again to see what’s changed.

**Estimate your weight**

One of the *least* important stats to track is your weight. Weight fluctuates a lot, so don’t get too caught up in the number. As long as you’re working toward your goals, you can pretty much ignore the number and focus on your progress in other areas. *An increase in weight is not a failure*, it’s noisy data. Keep working hard, keep coming back, keep checking in, and the results will come. 

That said, weight is easy to measure and if it’s averaged over a large sample of people, it can be a meaningful measure of progress for a group. For those reasons, the weekly check in form will track weight. But again, don’t get too caught up in the number when you check in.

**Estimate your body fat percentage**

The weight that you want to work off should be mostly fat, not muscle mass, and the best way to find out if you’re losing fat or muscle is to estimate your body fat percentage.

* [Visually](https://awasteofawaist.wordpress.com/2011/03/03/why-body-fat-day-53/) - an easy first approximation, but this might not be all that accurate 

**Keep records, take before shots**

For all of your initial stats, **write them down**. You don’t have to post them here, but have them written down somewhere they'll be easy to find again.
 
Final step: take pictures! If you’re anything like me, you *don’t* want to take before pictures.

I hope things are going well with you. So far we've talked about our [goals](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/krlrq/dailygoaltodo_day_1_september_26th_2011/), [diets](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/ksr2y/dailygoaltodo_day_2_september_27th_2011/), and [exercise plans](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/ktw5a/dailygoaltodo_day_3_september_28th_2011/). Today, let's talk groups.

In Round 4, we introduced teams to keep people motivated and help everyone get to know each other better. The general feedback at the end of the round was that the teams were not active enough to keep motivation high. There were too many teams, with too few people in each one. This round we're going to try to fix that. For starters, we'll have fewer teams with (hopefully) more members in each. We'll also have multiple team leaders for each group and a set posting schedule decided in advance.

Before you sign up for teams, here are the descriptions of the ones that are already planned so that you'll know what to expect:

###Women Losing Weight

&gt; Fun fact: 54% of 90ers are women this round. The women losing weight team provides a place for ladies to ask any woman-related questions, get female-specific advice, or just a place to hang out and talk to other women. The WLW team was very successful in Round 4. There were daily discussion posts and a strong set of members. Baiser has agreed to co-lead the WLW team again this round, but we're looking for one or two more ladies to help share the effort. If you're interested in helping out with the daily threads, please get in touch with baiser to work out the details of who will post and when.

###Runners (edit: [First team post is up!](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/kviia/runners_lets_get_moving/))

&gt; Fun fact: 78% of 90ers are planning to run, jog, or walk this round. We had several running-related teams in the last round. This time we're going to consolidate things. Mr_Nox and katiekatums will be co-leading the running team, which will include runners of all levels. There will be a weekly post on **Tuesdays** to talk about your progress for the past week, your plans for the current week, and any running-related questions that might come up. Hopefully there will be a large number of people starting the [Couch to 5K](http://www.c25k.com/) program around the same time this round and we will be able to talk about our progress as we move through the program. C25K graduates and long-time runners may be able to offer tips and feedback to help us on our way.

###Motivation (edit: [First team post is up!](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/kvccs/motivation_thursday_stats_updates_week_1/))

&gt; Fun fact: probably 100% of the 90ers want some motivation this round. The motivation team is a group for 90ers who are either looking for motivation or looking to motivate others. The group is designed to encourage people to open up and display their weaknesses and have the leaders and other members push each other to get rid of those weaknesses or work around them and make them into strengths.

&gt; JosephLeo will be leading this team. Daily posts will be as follows:

&gt; * **Monday:** Weekly Planner &amp; Challenge - Plan out your week and try out the weekly challenge
&gt; * **Tuesday:** Get Ready - Prepare yourself for the upcoming work week and learn how to avoid dietary traps
&gt; * **Wednesday:** Midweek Madness - Prepare for a quick work out challenge that's easy to do and just about anyone can do it.
&gt; * **Thursday:** Stats &amp; Updates - Post your weekly stats, updates or any photos you might have to share
&gt; * **Friday:** Almost There - Check in to see how you're doing and see how the rest of the community is doing too
&gt; * **Saturday:** Weekend Break - With the challenges for the week done it's now time to take a break until Monday. Check in for tips on how to enjoy your weekend without destroying your diet.

###Collegiate (edit: [First team post is up!](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/kva0z/collegiate_biweekly_post_1/))

&gt; Fun fact: about 30-60% of 90ers are college-aged, depending on your definition of ""college-aged."" The collegiate team is for any students who are dedicating what little time and energy they have to achieving their own weight loss and fitness goals. Between the trips to the library and the late nights writing papers, we are changing our lives one day at a time.

&gt; wolfbaden6 and absolutelovelie will be co-leading the collegiate team. They will post twice-weekly threads as follows:

&gt; * ~~Monday~~ **Sunday:** to get you through the drudgery of the start of the week
&gt; * **Thursday:** because that's when partying and bad decisions start

###Other groups

&gt; You are certainly more than welcome to form other teams. For example, 22% of 90ers are following keto or paleo this round and you may want to form a team that posts weekly recipe threads. If you have an idea for a team that you are willing to lead, you can add it as a column in the team spreadsheet.

&gt; If a team doesn't have a leader, it will likely not have regular weekly posts. But members of a group can still post threads for a group on their own. Continuing the example above, anybody can start a [keto] thread anytime, even if an official team is never formed.

&gt; (Edit: A **paleo** team will be led by vampire_kitty! [First team post is up!](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/kvem0/paleo_ive_started_a_team_for_those_following_or/))

&gt; (Edit: **P90/P90X** and **Bikers** teams have been proposed. Calling all leaders!)

###Just give me the signup sheet already!

&gt; Ok, ok, here it is: **[R5 team signup sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsOUFG-d9pcodDQwS1hOMXpRUHRtVDdGTXZxZFo2Q3c&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0)** (edit: Sorry for the problems this morning. The spreadsheet should be open for editing now.)

&gt; Just fill in your name under whichever team you'd like to join. Then participate in any team posts that come up. If you're willing to help co-lead any of the teams, please get in touch with one of the leaders that is already signed up for that team.

&gt; If you've got any questions, please ask here or message the mods!

**Monday:** Push up Challenge! Mondays will be a constant throughout the 90 days. How many push ups can you do, with good form? They can be [wall push ups](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RtM3L00BUU), [knee push ups](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/PectoralSternal/BWPushupKnee.html), [standard push ups](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh00_rniF8E), [one handed](http://www.beastskills.com/one-arm-pushup/)... You get the idea. Do three sets to failure. Each week we'll track our numbers and see how we improve. When you've done your push ups, come and post your numbers.

**Tuesday:** Planks. Similar to the push up challenge, Tuesdays will be plank days. Going forward, we'll throw in plank variations, but this week we'll keep it simple with the [standard plank](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSHjTRCQxIw). How long can you hold it? We'll keep track and see our improvements every week.

**Wednesday:** This week it's [triceps dips](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Triceps/BWBenchDip.html) and [walk up planks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8qOQ85fWNM). Do three sets of each, and check in as you do them.

**Thursday:** [Lunges](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BWLunge.html) and [squats](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BWSquat.html), three sets of each. Check in as you do them, and let us know how many!

**Friday:** [Mountain climbers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyeZM-_VnRc) and [Bicycle crunches](http://www.fitnessfrog.com/exercises/abs/44-bicycle-crunch.html). Three sets of each and check in as you go.

Eating disorders.,26,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/o5pje/over_exercise_extreme_dieting_eating_disorders/,"As we all at 90dg head towards Round 6, I want to take a moment to touch on a few things.  While we are all thrilled when we see desired results, I just want to give a cautionary word on doing things the wrong way.

**Over Exercise Addiction.**

 Yes, there is such a thing.  And no, it's isn't healthy.  Akin to an eating disorder, over exercise addiction is typically when an individual exercises too much--repeatedly, ignoring their body's signs of injury and extreme fatigue.  Our bodies are NOT designed to repeatedly exercise beyond what is considered safe.  Often, the person suffering through this will feel tremendous guilt if they do not exercise &amp; will often bargain with their conscience just so they can exercise (ie. I can't eat today unless I....).  This is counter productive to living a healthy lifestyle.  It's just another way to ""purge.""  I strongly encourage everyone to exercise safely &amp; also to give your body time to rest &amp; (in case of injury) repair.

**Eating disorders.**  

Now that I touched up on over exercising, I'd like to discuss eating disorders.  As someone who suffers through ED (though am in a winning battle...I hope!), I know first hand how easily it can be to slip into such dangerous habits.  I personally have suffered through the hell that is bulimia.  And I know how awful a person can feel when they eat something ""bad.""  Or how your mind can justify the idea of kneeling over a toilet after a meal.  I strongly encourage ANYONE who suffers from or is practicing unsafe eating habits to seek medical help.  Beyond that, I want you to sit down and undertake some deep introspection.  We want you here!  But we also want you here in a safe and healthy capacity.  So please think about WHY you are wanting to lose weight.

**Extreme dieting.**

I wanted to keep this seperate from my ED discussion with reason.  While yes, some who suffer through ED also dieting extremely, that isn't always the case.  Often, we have individuals who will sign up &amp; create unrealistic expectations of eating 800-1000 calorie a day.  Please reconsider this.  Your body is not designed to live off of only 800 calories a day.  You are starving yourself.  Your body needs fuel and that is FOOD.  Though you might lose a few lbs, soon your body will go into starvation mode &amp; you will NOT lose weight (this last statement is up for debate--&amp;am speaking through personal experience).  

While do not consider myself an ""expert"" in any of the topics I've discussed, I feel like I have a little experience in this area.  If you have any comments, suggestions please let me know!  Every member is more than welcome to PM me if they ever need to talk.  You are not alone!

***

In the rest of this post, I’m hoping to answer the question *“Where do I start?”* A lot of the material today is summarized from Tom Venuto’s [Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle](http://www.burnthefat.com/) (highly recommended reading). The first section is mostly geared toward weight-loss goals, but if you have non-weight related goals, the goal setting tips in the second section are applicable to all types of goals.

###**Where am I now?**

Before you get started figuring out what you want to change, first figure out exactly where you are. Write down an initial measurement for as many things as you can. Some of the easy ones are your weight, body fat percentage, chest/hips/waist measurements (flexible measuring tapes are cheap, no excuses), max number of push-ups/pull-ups/sit-ups, jogging/biking/swimming distance/speed. Even if you’re not specifically aiming to improve one of these stats, measure it anyway. After 90 days, measure again to see what’s changed.

**Estimate your weight**

One of the *least* important stats to track is your weight. Weight fluctuates a lot, so don’t get too caught up in the number. As long as you’re working toward your goals, you can pretty much ignore the number and focus on your progress in other areas. *An increase in weight is not a failure*, it’s noisy data. Keep working hard, keep coming back, keep checking in, and the results will come. 

That said, weight is easy to measure and if it’s averaged over a large sample of people, it can be a meaningful measure of progress for a group. For those reasons, the weekly check in form will track weight. But again, don’t get too caught up in the number when you check in.

**Estimate your body fat percentage**

One of the *most* important stats to track is your body fat percentage. The weight that you want to work off should be mostly fat, not muscle mass, and the best way to find out if you’re losing fat or muscle is to estimate your body fat percentage. There are lots of ways to get this number. Here are a couple sites to help you find it:

* [Check with your doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage#Measurement_techniques) - these are the most accurate techniques, but they are more difficult to do regularly
* [Calipers or tape measure](http://www.linear-software.com/online.html) - calipers are your best bet for a more accurate home test, the tape measure method is cheap and easy to do on your own
* [Digital scales](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ff&amp;authuser=0#q=body+weight+percentage+scale&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;authuser=0&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=shop&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Gfm7UIKWNIO89QTVuIHoCw&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAA&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=8eaf7385bef36188&amp;bpcl=39314241&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=972) - these can give a wide range of values throughout the day and depending on room conditions, so try to measure in the same way each time
* [Visually](https://awasteofawaist.wordpress.com/2011/03/03/why-body-fat-day-53/) - an easy first approximation, but this might not be all that accurate 

**Keep records, take before shots**

For all of your initial stats, **write them down**. You don’t have to post them here, but have them written down somewhere they'll be easy to find again.
 
Final step: take pictures! If you’re anything like me, you *don’t* want to take before pictures. If you don’t take them now though, you will really regret it when you’ve made an amazing transformation. Here are some examples of the poses that the [P90X program](http://www.reddit.com/r/p90x) recommends: [NSFW] [1](http://screenflicker.com/mike/images/200902-before_after.jpg), [2](http://oi54.tinypic.com/w6ti86.jpg). 

###**Where do I want to be?**

Ok, now that we have very specific, numerical values for where we are now, we can move on to where we want to be. To figure out where we want to be, let’s start setting our goals. Setting goals has been the single most helpful thing that I got from Venuto’s book. Here’s a (long) tl;dr version:

* Make **specific, measurable** goals. Pinpoint the weight or waist size that you want to be. Use the visual body fat percentage site above to get an idea of what body fat percentage you’d like to end up at. 
* **Aim high.** You *can* do this. If you really want to make the change, you will accomplish it. Set your goals where you *want* them, not where you think you’ll be able to reach. (Disclaimer: I’m serious, if you *want* this, you *will* get it, so **make sure your goals are healthy** before you start. Try picking something in the middle of the [“healthy” BMI range](http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/). Although BMI isn’t the best measure of body composition, it gives an okay approximation for how low is too low for most people.
* Have **realistic deadlines**. A reasonable guideline for weight loss is about 1-2 lbs (0.5-1 kg) per week, or about 13-26 lbs (6-12 kg) in 90 days. If you need to lose more than this, great! I’ll be here for the next round, and I hope others will stick around with me! You can set your 90-day goals higher than this, but it will mean lots of hard work on your part and you might risk burning yourself out.
* Write **long-term and short-term** goals. Specifically, Venuto suggests the following six types of goals: **1) ultimate long-term goal, 2) one-year goal, 3) 90-days goal, 4) weekly goals, 5) daily goals, and 6) beating your personal best**. Right now, as you’re reading this, get out some paper or open up Notepad and write out those headers. Then start listing them out. Where do you want to be in 5 years? Next year? At the end of this round of 90days? Your weekly goals will help you to know if you’re on track, and your daily goals will help you to take things one step at a time while forming the habits that you’ll need to reach your goals and maintain your new lifestyle once you’ve reached them. 
* Make your goals emotionally charged. Why do you want to reach those goals? Why is it important that you meet them? If you’re trying to lose weight for external reasons, it might not motivate you as much as something that’s extremely personal to you. Make them *your* goals and know *why* those are your goals.
* If your goals conflict with each other, **prioritize** them. If you want to lose weight and gain muscle, you might need to do this in steps - working off the fat with moderate muscle gains, and then building up the muscle with some weight gain. 
* State your goals as **affirmations**. Specifically, Venuto suggests three things for your affirmations: make them **personal**, write them in the **present tense**, and make them **positive**. “At the end of this round, I am extremely happy that I weigh 150 lbs.” Avoid the future tense and negative statements (“By the end of this round, I will have lost 15 lbs”).
* **Read your goals often!** Write out your goals (for real, write them out now) and read over them often. Read your goals when you wake up or when you check your email. Keep them at the front of your mind. 
* **Believe your goals.** When you reread your goals, believe that they are going to happen. Don’t tell yourself you won’t get there, know that you *will* reach those goals. You *want* to get there, and it *will* happen.
* The last thing Venuto recommends is to **visualize** your goals when you read through them. See yourself at the weight you want to be. Make your pictures as vivid as you can. 

###**Where do I start? / TL;DR**

First step: Figure out where you stand now. Second step: Write down your goals for where you want to be. Third step: Fill out the [signup form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDBCbWtGMkVJaWp6OFlzT1FuZHphaXc6MA#gid=0). 

Your goals should get you fired up and ready to go. Once you’ve got your goals written down, keep them somewhere you can see them often. You *really* want these things to happen, you’ve explained *why* you want them to happen, you can *see* them happening, and you know that they *will* happen. That’s a significant first step. 

Once you’ve got them, tell us about your goals for today! Feel free to post your longer term goals too. Ask any questions you have. Answer any questions you’re knowledgeable about. Support and encourage your fellow 90DGers!

What are the Daily Challenges?  Every week day, I'll be posting a set of body weight exercises.  You can join us by doing 1-3 sets, reporting in as you progress.  You may also choose to save up several days' exercises and do them all at once. 

These exercises will be doable just about anywhere - at home, in an empty conference or class room, at the end of a hallway, etc.  I'll sometimes give you a choice of alternative exercises, just in case you're not quite ready for the standard exercise (ex. knee pushups vs standard pushups).  

The idea is to do the exercises throughout the day, keeping your body and mind focused on your fitness goals.  You'll also learn some new exercises that you can incorporate into your standard routines.

***

Today is upper body day.  We'll be doing:

* [Push-ups](http://hundredpushups.com/what.html) (""proper"" or knee)
* [Bench dips](http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Triceps/BWBenchDip.html) (keep your heels on the floor if you want an easier alternative)

Try to do at least three sets of each and report on your progress as you go.  And if you can only do 1 or 2 reps, it's a great start!  You'll get better as you practice and build strength.

As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Have fun,

Nox

On a side note, because I think about this constantly, I talk about it a lot. It's interesting that in nearly every conversation I have, no matter where I'm at, the comment is almost always ""They say the first 5/10/15 pounds is the easiest"", or ""that first 5/10/15 pounds just falls off doesn't it?"".

###Buddies
For today's post, we're going to try adding another layer of accountability on top of dailygoals and teams. Several people have put up threads searching for a small group of buddies to keep in close contact with over the course of the round. The idea is that you will have someone that you will get to know fairly well over the next three months and the two of you will help each other stay on track. If you're interested in finding a buddy, there a couple routes you can take:

1. You can post here about what you're looking for in a buddy.

2. You can post a dedicated thread calling for buddies.

3. You can add your name to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsOUFG-d9pcodG15ZFozYXhabnptLXNzX3ZKU09BY2c&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0). In the first column, put your reddit name. Second column is anything that you'd like to have in common with your buddy. It could be your age, weight, height, gender, weight loss goal, weight gain goal, life goal, diet or exercise program that you'll be following, a hobby that you have, favorite color, or anything else you want. The more specific you make your criteria, the harder it might be to find a match, but you might also end up with a better match that way. After you've added yourself, read through the others and see if there's anyone you're interested in buddying with. If so, put your name in the third column and send them a PM. Chat it up, have some wine, light some candles, and see if you hit it off. If so, put their name next to your original post to let others know you're taken.

Hopefully, working back and forth, we can get everyone a buddy who wants a buddy. Once you have one, it's up to you and your buddy to keep each other in check however you want - PMs, emails, text messages, whatever. There are no rigid rules with buddies, just take it whichever direction works best for you.

Actually running.  I couldn't do that just several weeks ago.  I'd get a stitch.  My calves would splinter.  My throat would get sore.  Sweat would blind me.  My heart would pound like crazy.  All these are things I conquered - I control my body now, rather than the other way round.

Just like learning a skill, fitness is something you learn - your body learns what it is capable of, and you learn to really listen to your body - when it's just complaining, and when it has reached capacity.  As you push it a little further each time, it gives more each time.

While I have grown to enjoy training to some degree, that isn't why I do it.  I'm running on the treadmill, and looking in the mirror.  I can see muscles rippling under my tshirt, where there used to be only fat.  There is enough sweat on the front to have knocked me out before, but now it's just a sign I'm working hard enough.  I can't see my belly bounce with every step, as it used to.  In fact, it's only the size of a hamburger bun now, where it used to be half a football.  This is why I do it.  

For the comments at work that I'm looking great, that ""if you keep this up you'll fade away!"".  The raised eyebrows and ""Wow!"" my ex gave after she saw me after a couple of months.  Being able to fit into my old suits (which are now becoming loose - well, in the waist, the chest is getting tighter!).  The far more attention I seem to get from the opposite sex now.  Being able to enjoy things that involve exercise, like bike riding, without worrying about not being able to make it.  

I will continue to do it because this is a positive change to my life - I can do more, enjoy more and overall life is more fun this way.  The things I gave up, I don't miss much anymore.  They are still there, I can still do them whenever I do want to, I just don't do them simply because they're there.  And this is why you should do it too - your life will simply be better if you're not unfit anymore.

***

In this post, I’m hoping to answer the question *“Where do I start?”* A lot of the material today is summarized from Tom Venuto’s [Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle](http://www.burnthefat.com/) (highly recommended reading). If you have non-weight related goals, the goal setting tips in the second section are applicable to all types of goals.

###**Where am I now?**

Before you get started figuring out what you want to change, figure out exactly where you are. Write down an initial number for as many things as you can. Some of the easy ones are your weight, body fat percentage, chest/hips/waist measurements (flexible measuring tapes are cheap, no excuses), max number of push-ups/pull-ups/sit-ups, jogging/biking/swimming distance/speed. Even if you’re not specifically aiming to increase one of these stats, measure it anyway. After 90 days, measure again to see what’s changed.

**Estimate your weight**

One of the *least* important stats to track is your weight. Weight fluctuates a lot. Don’t get too caught up in the number. As long as you’re working toward your goals, you can pretty much ignore the number and focus on your progress in other areas. *An increase in weight is not a failure*, it’s noisy data. Keep working hard, keep coming back, keep checking in, and the results will come. 

That said, weight is easy to measure and if it’s averaged over a large sample, it can be a meaningful measure of progress for a group. For those reasons, the weekly check in form will track weight. But again, don’t get too caught up in the number when you check in.

**Estimate your body fat percentage**

One of the *most* important stats to track is your body fat percentage. The weight that you want to work off should be mostly fat, not muscle mass, and the best way to find out if you’re losing fat or muscle is to estimate your body fat percentage. There are lots of ways to get this number. Here are a couple sites to help you find it:

* [Check with your doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage#Measurement_techniques) - these are the most accurate techniques, but they are more difficult to do regularly
* [Calipers or tape measure](http://www.linear-software.com/online.html) - calipers are your best bet for a more accurate home test, the tape measure method is cheap and easy to do on your own
* [Digital scales](http://www.google.com/search?q=body+fat+percentage+scale&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=G&amp;biw=1408&amp;bih=671&amp;prmd=s&amp;source=univ&amp;tbs=shop:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;ei=YL7gTJ6CA4G0lQep79W7Aw&amp;oi=product_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEAQrQQwAg) - these can give a wide range of values throughout the day and depending on room conditions, so try to measure in the same way each time
* [Visually](https://awasteofawaist.wordpress.com/tag/body-fat-percentage/) - an easy first approximation, but this might not be all that accurate 

**Keep records, take before shots**

For all of your initial stats, **write them down**. You don’t have to post them here, but have them written down somewhere.
 
Final step: take pictures! If you’re anything like me, you *don’t* want to take before pictures. If you don’t take them now though, you will really regret it when you’ve made an amazing transformation. Here are some examples of the poses that the P90X program recommends: [NSFW] [1](http://screenflicker.com/mike/images/200902-before_after.jpg), [2](http://i54.tinypic.com/w6ti86.jpg). 

*** 

###**Where do I want to be?**

Ok, now that we have very specific, numerical values for where we are now, we can move on to where we want to be. To figure out where we want to be, let’s start setting our goals. Setting goals has been the single most helpful thing that I got from Venuto’s book. Here’s a (long) tl;dr version:

* Make **specific, measurable** goals. Pinpoint the weight or waist size that you want to be. Use the visual body fat percentage site above to get an idea of what body fat percentage you’d like to end up at. 
* **Aim high.** You *can* do this. If you really want to make the change, you will accomplish it. Set your goals where you *want* them, not where you think you’ll be able to reach. (Disclaimer: I’m serious, if you *want* this, you *will* get it, so **make sure your goals are healthy** before you start. Try picking something in the middle of the [“healthy” BMI range](http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/). Although BMI isn’t the best measure of body composition, it gives an okay approximation for how low is too low for most people.
* Have **realistic deadlines**. A reasonable guideline for weight loss is about 1-2 lbs (0.5-1 kg) per week, or about 13-26 lbs (6-12 kg) in 90 days. If you need to lose more than this, great! I’ll be here for the next round, and I hope others will stick around with me! You can set your 90-day goals higher than this, but it will mean lots of hard work on your part and you might risk burning yourself out.
* Write **long-term and short-term** goals. Specifically, Venuto suggests the following six types of goals: **1) ultimate long-term goal, 2) one-year goal, 3) 90-days goal, 4) weekly goals, 5) daily goals, and 6) beating your personal best**. Right now, as you’re reading this, get out some paper or open up Notepad and write out those headers. Then start listing them out. Where do you want to be in 5 years? Next year? At the end of this round of 90days? Your weekly goals will help you to know if you’re on track, and your daily goals will help you to take things one step at a time while forming the habits that you’ll need to reach your goals and maintain your new lifestyle once you’ve reached them. 
* Make your goals emotionally charged. Why do you want to reach those goals? Why is it important that you meet them? If you’re trying to lose weight for external reasons, it might not motivate you as much as something that’s extremely personal to you. Make them *your* goals and know *why* those are your goals.
* If your goals conflict with each other, **prioritize** them. If you want to lose weight and gain muscle, you might need to do this in steps - working off the fat with moderate muscle gains, and then building up the muscle with some weight gain. 
* State your goals as **affirmations**. Specifically, Venuto suggests three things for your affirmations: make them **personal**, write them in the **present tense**, and make them **positive**. “At the end of this round, I am extremely happy that I weigh 150 lbs.” Avoid the future tense and negative statements (“By the end of this round, I will have lost 15 lbs”).
* **Read your goals often!** Write out your goals (for real, write them out now) and read over them often. Read your goals when you wake up or when you check your email. Keep them at the front of your mind. 
* **Believe your goals.** When you reread your goals, believe that they are going to happen. Don’t tell yourself you won’t get there, know that you *will* reach those goals. You *want* to get there, and it *will* happen.
* The last thing Venuto recommends is to **visualize** your goals when you read through them. See yourself at the weight you want to be. Make your pictures as vivid as you can.

###**Where do I start? / TL;DR**

First step: Figure out where you stand now. Second step: Write down your goals for where you want to be. Third step: Fill out the [signup form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE9FT25TZFhlNXJwckZCbGJpYVY2YWc6MA#gid=10). 

Your goals should get you fired up and ready to go. Once you’ve got your goals written down, keep them somewhere you can see them often. You *really* want these things to happen, you’ve explained *why* you want them to happen, you can *see* them happening, and you know that they *will* happen. That’s a significant first step. 

Once you’ve got them, tell us about your goals for today! Feel free to post your longer term goals too. Ask any questions you have. Answer any questions you’re knowledgeable about. Support and encourage your fellow 90ers!

***

In the rest of this post, I’m hoping to answer the question *“Where do I start?”* A lot of the material today is summarized from Tom Venuto’s [Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle](http://www.burnthefat.com/) (highly recommended reading). The first section is mostly geared toward weight-loss goals, but if you have non-weight related goals, the goal setting tips in the second section are applicable to all types of goals.

###**Where am I now?**

Before you get started figuring out what you want to change, first figure out exactly where you are. Write down an initial measurement for as many things as you can. Some of the easy ones are your weight, body fat percentage, chest/hips/waist measurements (flexible measuring tapes are cheap, no excuses), max number of push-ups/pull-ups/sit-ups, jogging/biking/swimming distance/speed. Even if you’re not specifically aiming to improve one of these stats, measure it anyway. After 90 days, measure again to see what’s changed.

**Estimate your weight**

One of the *least* important stats to track is your weight. Weight fluctuates a lot, so don’t get too caught up in the number. As long as you’re working toward your goals, you can pretty much ignore the number and focus on your progress in other areas. *An increase in weight is not a failure*, it’s noisy data. Keep working hard, keep coming back, keep checking in, and the results will come. 

That said, weight is easy to measure and if it’s averaged over a large sample of people, it can be a meaningful measure of progress for a group. For those reasons, the weekly check in form will track weight. But again, don’t get too caught up in the number when you check in.

**Estimate your body fat percentage**

One of the *most* important stats to track is your body fat percentage. The weight that you want to work off should be mostly fat, not muscle mass, and the best way to find out if you’re losing fat or muscle is to estimate your body fat percentage. There are lots of ways to get this number. Here are a couple sites to help you find it:

* [Check with your doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage#Measurement_techniques) - these are the most accurate techniques, but they are more difficult to do regularly
* [Calipers or tape measure](http://www.linear-software.com/online.html) - calipers are your best bet for a more accurate home test, the tape measure method is cheap and easy to do on your own
* [Digital scales](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ff&amp;authuser=0#q=body+weight+percentage+scale&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;authuser=0&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=shop&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Gfm7UIKWNIO89QTVuIHoCw&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAA&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=8eaf7385bef36188&amp;bpcl=39314241&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=972) - these can give a wide range of values throughout the day and depending on room conditions, so try to measure in the same way each time
* [Visually](https://awasteofawaist.wordpress.com/2011/03/03/why-body-fat-day-53/) - an easy first approximation, but this might not be all that accurate 

**Keep records, take before shots**

For all of your initial stats, **write them down**. You don’t have to post them here, but have them written down somewhere they'll be easy to find again.
 
Final step: take pictures! If you’re anything like me, you *don’t* want to take before pictures. If you don’t take them now though, you will really regret it when you’ve made an amazing transformation. Here are some examples of the poses that the [P90X program](http://www.reddit.com/r/p90x) recommends: [NSFW] [1](http://screenflicker.com/mike/images/200902-before_after.jpg), [2](http://oi54.tinypic.com/w6ti86.jpg). 

###**Where do I want to be?**

Ok, now that we have very specific, numerical values for where we are now, we can move on to where we want to be. To figure out where we want to be, let’s start setting our goals. Setting goals has been the single most helpful thing that I got from Venuto’s book. Here’s a (long) tl;dr version:

* Make **specific, measurable** goals. Pinpoint the weight or waist size that you want to be. Use the visual body fat percentage site above to get an idea of what body fat percentage you’d like to end up at. 
* **Aim high.** You *can* do this. If you really want to make the change, you will accomplish it. Set your goals where you *want* them, not where you think you’ll be able to reach. (Disclaimer: I’m serious, if you *want* this, you *will* get it, so **make sure your goals are healthy** before you start. Try picking something in the middle of the [“healthy” BMI range](http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/). Although BMI isn’t the best measure of body composition, it gives an okay approximation for how low is too low for most people.
* Have **realistic deadlines**. A reasonable guideline for weight loss is about 1-2 lbs (0.5-1 kg) per week, or about 13-26 lbs (6-12 kg) in 90 days. If you need to lose more than this, great! I’ll be here for the next round, and I hope others will stick around with me! You can set your 90-day goals higher than this, but it will mean lots of hard work on your part and you might risk burning yourself out.
* Write **long-term and short-term** goals. Specifically, Venuto suggests the following six types of goals: **1) ultimate long-term goal, 2) one-year goal, 3) 90-days goal, 4) weekly goals, 5) daily goals, and 6) beating your personal best**. Right now, as you’re reading this, get out some paper or open up Notepad and write out those headers. Then start listing them out. Where do you want to be in 5 years? Next year? At the end of this round of 90days? Your weekly goals will help you to know if you’re on track, and your daily goals will help you to take things one step at a time while forming the habits that you’ll need to reach your goals and maintain your new lifestyle once you’ve reached them. 
* Make your goals emotionally charged. Why do you want to reach those goals? Why is it important that you meet them? If you’re trying to lose weight for external reasons, it might not motivate you as much as something that’s extremely personal to you. Make them *your* goals and know *why* those are your goals.
* If your goals conflict with each other, **prioritize** them. If you want to lose weight and gain muscle, you might need to do this in steps - working off the fat with moderate muscle gains, and then building up the muscle with some weight gain. 
* State your goals as **affirmations**. Specifically, Venuto suggests three things for your affirmations: make them **personal**, write them in the **present tense**, and make them **positive**. “At the end of this round, I am extremely happy that I weigh 150 lbs.” Avoid the future tense and negative statements (“By the end of this round, I will have lost 15 lbs”).
* **Read your goals often!** Write out your goals (for real, write them out now) and read over them often. Read your goals when you wake up or when you check your email. Keep them at the front of your mind. 
* **Believe your goals.** When you reread your goals, believe that they are going to happen. Don’t tell yourself you won’t get there, know that you *will* reach those goals. You *want* to get there, and it *will* happen.
* The last thing Venuto recommends is to **visualize** your goals when you read through them. See yourself at the weight you want to be. Make your pictures as vivid as you can. 

###**Where do I start? / TL;DR**

First step: Figure out where you stand now. Second step: Write down your goals for where you want to be. Third step: Fill out the [signup form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGFHemRiLVliQWgzR3ItOXJXQlI0YlE6MA#gid=0). 

Your goals should get you fired up and ready to go. Once you’ve got your goals written down, keep them somewhere you can see them often. You *really* want these things to happen, you’ve explained *why* you want them to happen, you can *see* them happening, and you know that they *will* happen. That’s a significant first step. 

Once you’ve got them, tell us about your goals for today! Feel free to post your longer term goals too. Ask any questions you have. Answer any questions you’re knowledgeable about. Support and encourage your fellow 90ers!

--------------------------------------

Some general tips:

* You can lose weight without exercise, but it's going to be more difficult, slower, and you'll likely end up losing muscle in addition to fat.

* The better route for weight loss is to incorporate activities into your daily routines to get you up and moving and using your muscles more than you did before. Whatever level of activity you're at now, try ramping it up a bit. That might mean taking the stairs instead of the elevator or adding a walk after dinner. Or it might mean lifting heavier weights at the gym or running a bit faster on your next jog.

* Track your progress. It's too easy to get bored with your routines if you don't have a way to measure your progress. Even just keeping a paper log of your lifts can help you here. If you're going to be jogging, running, swimming, biking, ellipticalling, or any other cardio, try measuring your speed, distance, duration, or whatever other metric you'd like to use. After a few weeks go by, flip back to the start of your log so you can see how far you've come.

* Push yourself. If your chosen activities don't get your heart rate up, then you should probably add in something that's a little more challenging to you.

* Cardio is great, but cardio plus weight lifting is better. There are lots of reasons to add weight lifting. The simplest is that you'll build or maintain muscle as you lose fat, which will prevent you from getting to a low weight with a high body fat percentage. Ladies: don't be afraid to lift heavy.

* Some programs that everyone seems to love: [Couch to 5K](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) (to move from no running experience to being able to run a 5K), [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_Strength_Wiki), [StrongLifts 5x5.](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/) and the [100 push up programm](http://www.hundredpushups.com/)

* Don't be afraid of the gym. Everybody had to start somewhere and everybody is focused on their own routines. Keep going back for more and you'll see some major transformations in your body.

* Do something fun. Go for a hike, play some basketball, go rafting.

* Tip from andyleclair: ""If you don't have any equipment, but want to check out body weight training, [this post](http://nerdfitness.com/blog/2009/12/09/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/) on nerd fitness is a great place to start.

I have my calorie allotment set to a goal of 1.5 lbs of loss per week.

But I'm SHOCKED by how quickly I ate up my calories today: 2 pieces of toast, 2 cups of coffee, granola bar, tomato soup, raisins, smoked oysters, fish, a potato, and a glass of milk.  

Now, I was relatively happy with my choices today.  I would've had fresh veggies in there had I planned better (I'll stock up tomorrow), but it's not like I'm packing away the McDonald's. I didn't expect to only have 69 calories (heh) left at the middle of the evening.

Is this going to backfire by just frustrating the hell out of me in the coming weeks?  Am I better off tracking something other than calories, like carbs?

Welcome to **Round 8**.  If this is your first round with 90dg, feel free to check out our [Introduction Thread](http://redd.it/xzrt5).

**Who we are**

Women Losing Weight (WLW) is a group within r/90daysgoal that is aimed specifically towards women.  We are a dedicated &amp; passionate group of ladies that are after the same goal: To better our lives.  Some of us are trying to lose weight.  Some of us are trying to gain.  But all of us are in need of support &amp; motivation and I hope you will find that here with us.  WLW is run by myself &amp; my lovely co-captain: [nanochic](http://www.reddit.com/user/nanochic).  Occassionally, our fellow mod [uninvitedthirteenth](http://www.reddit.com/user/uninvitedthirteenth) may help out in the absence of nanochic or I.

**What we do**

WLW does not have a set goal within our time.  Our initiative is to encourage &amp; help one another on our journey towards change.  We want to target gender specific issues that you could be dealing with during this round.  Ideally, we'd also love to get to know one another beyond just our weight &amp; exercise routine. We want to know more about you.

**You**

Day 01 is always, undoubtedly, one of the busiest days of the round.  So in an effort to minimize the odds of feeling overwhelmed, I want today to be a casual, welcoming &amp; open day of discussion.  Let us know **who you are**.  Have you decided on a plan of action/ end goal?  If so, what is it?  If you haven't thought about it, please take the time to do so today.  Let's kickstart this round off on the right foot.  If you have any questiions, feel free to ask them.

Today's topic is **exercise**.

---

Some general tips:

* You can lose weight without exercise, but it's going to be more difficult, slower, and you'll likely end up losing muscle in addition to fat.

* The better route for weight loss is to incorporate activities into your daily routines to *get you up and moving and using your muscles more than you did before*. Whatever level of activity you're at now, try ramping it up a bit. That might mean taking the stairs instead of the elevator or adding a walk after dinner. Or it might mean lifting heavier weights at the gym or running a bit faster on your next jog.

* *Track your progress*. It's too easy to get bored with your routines if you don't have a way to measure your progress. Even just keeping a paper log of your lifts can help you here. If you're going to be jogging, running, swimming, biking, ellipticalling, or any other cardio, try measuring your speed, distance, duration, or whatever other metric you'd like to use. After a few weeks go by, flip back to the start of your log so you can see how far you've come.

* *Push yourself*. If your chosen activities don't get your heart rate up, then you should probably add in something that's a little more challenging to you.

* Cardio is great, but *cardio plus weight lifting is* **much** *better*. There are lots of reasons to add weight lifting. The simplest is that you'll build or maintain muscle as you lose fat, which will prevent you from getting to a low weight with a high body fat percentage. Ladies: don't be afraid to lift heavy.

* Some programs that everyone seems to love: [Couch to 5K](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) (to move from no running experience to being able to run a 5K), [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_Strength_Wiki), [StrongLifts 5x5.](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/) and the [100 push up program](http://www.hundredpushups.com/).

* *Don't be afraid of the gym*. Everybody had to start somewhere and everybody is focused on their own routines. Keep going back for more and you'll see some major transformations in your body.  /r/Fitness's FAQ has [a good section on what to expect at the gym and proper etiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness#GymEtiquette).

* *Do something fun*. Go for a hike, play some basketball, go rafting.

* Tip from andyleclair: ""If you don't have any equipment, but want to check out body weight training, [this post](http://nerdfitness.com/blog/2009/12/09/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/) on nerd fitness is a great place to start. It's a full circuit workout, and the only equipment needed is a gallon jug filled with water. There's also a nice video explaining the exercises"".

* Some free resources that one should at least skim through is the [r/fitness faq](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness) and the [brain over brawn ebook](http://brainoverbrawn.com/get-the-book/).

* Good sites to look up exercises include [ExRx](http://exrx.net/), [Bodybuilding.com (with many videos)](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/) and [workout-routine](http://www.workout-routine.com/workout-routines.html).

* If you haven't done so already, join [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com). It gives you a good overview on what your fellow 90DGers are doing and will include our fitocracy [challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1i8x4y/fitocracy_round_11_challenge_information_and/) every sprint.

Today's topic is **Diets**:

We have people following all kinds of diets here, so I'll try to keep this reasonably general. Here are a couple things that I've picked up over the last few rounds:

* *Don't diet!  Instead, change your eating habits*. Figure out your weaknesses and try to tackle those this round. Do you eat a whole bag of candy before you realize it's gone? Do you have big weekend binges after a week of healthy eating? Does drinking make you eat more? Do you tend to eat late at night? Do you eat when you're bored/stressed/alone/with friends? Do salty snacks make you crave more salty things? Do sugary snacks make you crave more sugary things? Figure out your triggers and try to recognize your old habits before you fall into them.

* *Listen to your body*. Lots of people end up eating too little when they're trying to lose weight. If you're feeling drained or moody, it might be because you aren't giving your body enough fuel. That doesn't mean you should blindly start eating more though. No matter what diet you're following, I think it's useful for everyone to calculate their BMR and target calories for the weight loss rate they'd like to reach. (There's more info about this [here](http://90daysgoal.com/getting-started/food-and-diet) &amp; [here](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/).)Then, without changing your diet, try tracking everything that you eat, every day, for a week or so. MyFitnessPal, LiveStrong, LoseIt, or other similar sites should be pretty useful here. How close do you get to your target calories? If you're way below, add in some fruits and veggies and other small snacks to round out your day. If you're way over, maybe look for some alternatives to some of the biggest contributors.

* *Don't deprive yourself -- strive for moderation*. Swearing off french fries or ice cream for the rest of your life is... mind boggling. I don't think I could do it. Eating enormous portions of fries and ice cream on a splurge day because you haven't had them in forever isn't a great idea either though. Work toward a middle road. Maybe allow yourself a small splurge once a month. Try to stick to a single serving and really savor it.

* *You can lose weight and still drink alcohol*. You'll have to be pretty good about it. Make some food compromises, watch what you're eating the rest of the day, aim for moderation, and savor every sip. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on alcohol might be an easy way to push through it.

* *You can lose weight and still eat bread/pasta/potatoes/rice/sweets*. Again, you'll just have to be good about it. Small servings of starchy/carby foods aren't going to derail your progress. But if your day consists of a bagel, a sandwich with potato chips, and pasta with a baked potato and a piece of pie, you might want to consider scaling back on the carbs and adding a lot of fruits and veggies. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on carbs might be an easy way to push through it.

* *A specific diet might work for lots of people, but that doesn't mean it will work for you*. Try it out, see how you feel, see how your weight responds, gauge how hard it will be for you to keep it up long-term. If it doesn't seem to be working for you, try to figure out which part seems to be the problem.

* *The end goal is a long-term, sustainable change to your eating habits*. Quick weight loss has a pretty high relapse rate. If you're nearing your long-term weight goals, start setting out a maintenance plan for yourself. Don't let yourself slip back into old bad habits. Keep an eye on your weight. Set an alarm weight for yourself, probably 5-10 lbs above your long-term goal weight. If you ever go above that weight, it's time to re-examine your eating habits and make sure you're still following your maintenance plan.

* That being said, I would like to briefly touch on the topic of *Eating Disorders*.  This was discussed in a post last round, but I feel that it bears repeating.  What all of us want for you, as a a member of 90daysgoal, is to find your niche, to eat healthy.  Eating can cause anxiety and stress -- especially when doing something new.  Stay away from dangerous dieting that could become counter productive to your health and well-being.  As it says in the first bullet, try and figure out your triggers &amp; stay away from behavior that could spiral you back into old habits.  Please know that we are always here if you need a sounding board.  BUT please also know that we cannot replace the expertise of a trained professional like a couselor or therapist.

With that in mind, let's talk about you!  What is your diet/eating habit plans for this round?  Do you have any questions about any diet you are interested in?  Do you have any questions about a diet you are already following?  

And how did you do yesterday?  Did you meet your goals?  What do you have on your agenda for the day?  It's Day 2, people!  Let's keep the momentum alive!

Have fun!

Nox

* That being said, I would like to briefly touch on the topic of: *Eating Disorders*.  This was discussed in another post, but I feel that it bears repeating.  As a survivor &amp; struggler of an ED, I know first hand how difficult it is to transition into healthy eating habits.  What all of us want for you, as a a member of 90daysgoal, is to find your niche, to eat healthy.  I know that eating can cause anxiety and stress--especially when doing something new.  I urge to stray away from dangerous dieting that could become counter productive to your health and well-being.  As it says in the first bullet, try and figure out your triggers &amp; stay away from behavior that could spiral you back into old habits.  Please know that we are always here if you need a sounding board.  BUT please also know that we cannot replace the expertise of a trained professional like a couselor or therapist.

With that in mind, let's talk about you!  What is your diet/eating habit plans for this round?  Do you have any questions about any diet you are interested in?  Do you have any questions about a diet you are already following?  

Personally, I am doing Paleo (80/20) and have been since November.  I've lost about 23 lbs.  It can be a little tough at times but as time goes along, it gets easier.  I think what has kept me in this diet longer than any other is that I've done my research.  &amp;I encourage you to do the same.

Now...!  Do you have any general dieting tips that you've picked up during your journey? Anything you've read or learned the hard way?


And lastly, how did you do yesterday?  Did you meet your goals?  What do you have on your agenda for the day?  It's Day 2, people!  Let's keep the momentum alive!

Apparently the flu has been going around at my work and my most fantastic 2012 filled with sleep deprivation and all sorts of awesomeness that led to the sleep dep has left my immune system in the dumps and so I caught the germs. I've maintained eating my strict paleo diet throughout but I have taken a break from the exercising whilst I rest and recover. I have to say, though, despite being sick I am still quite enjoying my life and all of the wonderful things that have come along with 2012 so I have no complaints. :D

It's a new round for us all.  That means, lets start our engines &amp; get to kicking some ass.

Some of you are new, some of you are not.  Regardless, we are all in this together!  I'd like to take a brief moment to introduce myself.  My name is Roxanne &amp; I am 26 years old.

It's helping me so far!",20,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/kvboe/tips_if_youre_like_me_and_like_to_eat_everything/,"My problem: If I see/smell something, even though I've already eaten, I'll usually go eat some of it. 

My solution: Keeping to calorie limits, but instead of eating only one large meal making up my breakfast/lunch/dinner meal, I split it up into a very small portion of eggs/pasta/bagels/oatmeal, etc, and then add small amounts of other foods [usually 1 or 2 sides].

Example: Yesterday [and the days before] I'll have an ultra thin bagel with goat cheese [180cals], and then have turkey bites [taste exactly like pepperettes with 1/2 the calories][50cal/ea] and then something that takes a little bit to eat [apple sauce, apple, etc]. 

When I see something else that I want to eat, I tell myself that I'm done. I had my 2 extra foods, and can wait until the next time I need to eat to incorporate whatever foods I'm craving, so long as it's portioned and with another low-cal part of my meal.

Maybe it's all in my head, but previously I'd have a hefty meal, and then try to tell myself not to snack. It was brutal. I'd usually cave in and eat a whole bag of crispy minis [which I switched to after it was a bag of chips][450cals] or grab ""just one more"" s'more or cookie. 

If you incorporate the foods you know you're going to crave into your meal, you'll be less inclined to eat it later because you've already eaten it. 

Hopefully this helps. Food is such a struggle for me - i have to trick myself into not eating more and more and more. I'm trying to change my mindset from: DINNER = EPIC HEAVY MEAL! to DINNER = What my body NEEDS to feel satisfied. 

Previously I'd stuff myself to the point it would hurt [even if I was feeling full already, I'd keep eating]. Now I save the left overs, and look forward to incorporating it into my 1 of 4 small meal the next day.  :)",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,,True,t3_kvboe,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/kvboe/tips_if_youre_like_me_and_like_to_eat_everything/,

Today's topic is *exercise*.

Some general tips:

* You can lose weight without exercise, but it's going to be more difficult, slower, and you'll likely end up losing muscle in addition to fat.

* The better route for weight loss is to incorporate activities into your daily routines to *get you up and moving and using your muscles more than you did before*. Whatever level of activity you're at now, try ramping it up a bit. That might mean taking the stairs instead of the elevator or adding a walk after dinner. Or it might mean lifting heavier weights at the gym or running a bit faster on your next jog.
Our [Fitocracy Challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1axeeo/fitocracy_round_10_challenge_information_and/) are a great way to motivate yourself to get out there and be active.

* *Track your progress*. It's too easy to get bored with your routines if you don't have a way to measure your progress. Even just keeping a paper log of your lifts can help you here. If you're going to be jogging, running, swimming, biking, ellipticalling, or any other cardio, try measuring your speed, distance, duration, or whatever other metric you'd like to use. After a few weeks go by, flip back to the start of your log so you can see how far you've come.

* *Push yourself*. If your chosen activities don't get your heart rate up, then you should probably add in something that's a little more challenging to you.

* Cardio is great, but *cardio plus weight lifting is* **much** *better*. There are lots of reasons to add weight lifting. The simplest is that you'll build or maintain muscle as you lose fat, which will prevent you from getting to a low weight with a high body fat percentage. Ladies: don't be afraid to lift heavy.

* Some programs that everyone seems to love: [Couch to 5K](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) (to move from no running experience to being able to run a 5K), [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_Strength_Wiki), [StrongLifts 5x5.](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/) and the [100 push up program](http://www.hundredpushups.com/).

* *Don't be afraid of the gym*. Everybody had to start somewhere and everybody is focused on their own routines. Keep going back for more and you'll see some major transformations in your body.  /r/Fitness's FAQ has [a good section on what to expect at the gym and proper etiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness#GymEtiquette).

* *Do something fun*. Go for a hike, play some basketball, go rafting.

* Tip from andyleclair: ""If you don't have any equipment, but want to check out body weight training, [this post](http://nerdfitness.com/blog/2009/12/09/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/) on nerd fitness is a great place to start. It's a full circuit workout, and the only equipment needed is a gallon jug filled with water. There's also a nice video explaining the exercises"".

* Some free resources that one should at least skim through is the [r/fitness faq](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness) and the [brain over brawn ebook](http://brainoverbrawn.com/get-the-book/).

* Good sites to look up exercises include [ExRx](http://exrx.net/), [Bodybuilding.com (with many videos)](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/) and [workout-routine](http://www.workout-routine.com/workout-routines.html).

Today's topic is **Diets**:

We have people following all kinds of diets here, so I'll try to keep this reasonably general. Here are a couple things that I've picked up over the last few rounds:

* *Don't diet!  Instead, change your eating habits*. Figure out your weaknesses and try to tackle those this round. Do you eat a whole bag of candy before you realize it's gone? Do you have big weekend binges after a week of healthy eating? Does drinking make you eat more? Do you tend to eat late at night? Do you eat when you're bored/stressed/alone/with friends? Do salty snacks make you crave more salty things? Do sugary snacks make you crave more sugary things? Figure out your triggers and try to recognize your old habits before you fall into them.

* *Listen to your body*. Lots of people end up eating too little when they're trying to lose weight. If you're feeling drained or moody, it might be because you aren't giving your body enough fuel. That doesn't mean you should blindly start eating more though. No matter what diet you're following, I think it's useful for everyone to calculate their BMR and target calories for the weight loss rate they'd like to reach. (There's more info about this [here](http://90daysgoal.com/getting-started/food-and-diet) &amp; [here](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/).)Then, without changing your diet, try tracking everything that you eat, every day, for a week or so. MyFitnessPal, LiveStrong, LoseIt, or other similar sites should be pretty useful here. How close do you get to your target calories? If you're way below, add in some fruits and veggies and other small snacks to round out your day. If you're way over, maybe look for some alternatives to some of the biggest contributors.

* *Don't deprive yourself -- strive for moderation*. Swearing off french fries or ice cream for the rest of your life is... mind boggling. I don't think I could do it. Eating enormous portions of fries and ice cream on a splurge day because you haven't had them in forever isn't a great idea either though. Work toward a middle road. Maybe allow yourself a small splurge once a month. Try to stick to a single serving and really savor it.

* *You can lose weight and still drink alcohol*. You'll have to be pretty good about it. Make some food compromises, watch what you're eating the rest of the day, aim for moderation, and savor every sip. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on alcohol might be an easy way to push through it.

* *You can lose weight and still eat bread/pasta/potatoes/rice/sweets*. Again, you'll just have to be good about it. Small servings of starchy/carby foods aren't going to derail your progress. But if your day consists of a bagel, a sandwich with potato chips, and pasta with a baked potato and a piece of pie, you might want to consider scaling back on the carbs and adding a lot of fruits and veggies. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on carbs might be an easy way to push through it.

* *A specific diet might work for lots of people, but that doesn't mean it will work for you*. Try it out, see how you feel, see how your weight responds, gauge how hard it will be for you to keep it up long-term. If it doesn't seem to be working for you, try to figure out which part seems to be the problem.

* *The end goal is a long-term, sustainable change to your eating habits*. Quick weight loss has a pretty high relapse rate. If you're nearing your long-term weight goals, start setting out a maintenance plan for yourself. Don't let yourself slip back into old bad habits. Keep an eye on your weight. Set an alarm weight for yourself, probably 5-10 lbs above your long-term goal weight. If you ever go above that weight, it's time to re-examine your eating habits and make sure you're still following your maintenance plan.

* That being said, I would like to briefly touch on the topic of *Eating Disorders*.  This was discussed in a post last round, but I feel that it bears repeating.  What all of us want for you, as a a member of 90daysgoal, is to find your niche, to eat healthy.  Eating can cause anxiety and stress -- especially when doing something new.  Stay away from dangerous dieting that could become counter productive to your health and well-being.  As it says in the first bullet, try and figure out your triggers &amp; stay away from behavior that could spiral you back into old habits.  Please know that we are always here if you need a sounding board.  BUT please also know that we cannot replace the expertise of a trained professional like a couselor or therapist.

With that in mind, let's talk about you!  What is your diet/eating habit plans for this round?  Do you have any questions about any diet you are interested in?  Do you have any questions about a diet you are already following?  

And how did you do yesterday?  Did you meet your goals?  What do you have on your agenda for the day?  It's Day 2, people!  Let's keep the momentum alive!

Have fun!

Welcome to Round 9! If this is your first round with 90dg, feel free to check out our [Introduction thread](http://redd.it/142fey)

**Who we are** 

Women Losing Weight (WLW) is a group within /r/90daysgoal that is aimed specifically towards women. We are a dedicated &amp; passionate group of ladies that are after the same goal: To better our lives. Some of us are trying to lose weight. Some of us are trying to gain. But all of us are in need of support &amp; motivation and I hope you will find that here with us. WLW is run by myself &amp; my lovely co-captains: /u/nanochic and /u/dinosaurdinosrawr

**What we do**

WLW does not have a set goal within our time. Our initiative is to encourage &amp; help one another on our journey towards change. We want to target gender specific issues that you could be dealing with during this round. Ideally, we'd also love to get to know one another beyond just our weight &amp; exercise routine. We want to know more about you.

**You**

Day 01 is always, undoubtedly, one of the busiest days of the round. So in an effort to minimize the odds of feeling overwhelmed, I want today to be a casual, welcoming &amp; open day of discussion. Let us know who you are. Have you decided on a plan of action/ end goal? If so, what is it? If you haven't thought about it, please take the time to do so today. Let's kickstart this round off on the right foot. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.

**EDIT:**  You guys are awesome at participating by commenting on each other's posts and having discussions, I love it!  :)",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,1354567301.0,,self5,True,t3_14741k,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/14741k/women_losing_weight_introduction/,

Eating Disorders.,20,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/tb2mm/over_exercise_extreme_diets_eating_disorders/,"As we all at 90dg head towards Round 6, I want to take a moment to touch on a few things. While we are all thrilled when we see desired results, I just want to give a cautionary word on doing things the wrong way.

**Over Exercise Addiction.**

Yes, there is such a thing. And no, it's isn't healthy. Akin to an eating disorder, over exercise addiction is typically when an individual exercises too much--repeatedly, ignoring their body's signs of injury and extreme fatigue. Our bodies are NOT designed to repeatedly exercise beyond what is considered safe. Often, the person suffering through this will feel tremendous guilt if they do not exercise &amp; will often bargain with their conscience just so they can exercise (ie. I can't eat today unless I....). This is counter productive to living a healthy lifestyle. It's just another way to ""purge."" I strongly encourage everyone to exercise safely &amp; also to give your body time to rest &amp; (in case of injury) repair.

**Eating disorders.**
Now that I touched up on over exercising, I'd like to discuss eating disorders. As someone who suffers through ED (though am in a winning battle...I hope!), I know first hand how easily it can be to slip into such dangerous habits. I personally have suffered through the hell that is bulimia. And I know how awful a person can feel when they eat something ""bad."" Or how your mind can justify the idea of kneeling over a toilet after a meal. I strongly encourage ANYONE who suffers from or is practicing unsafe eating habits to seek medical help. Beyond that, I want you to sit down and undertake some deep introspection. We want you here! But we also want you here in a safe and healthy capacity. So please think about WHY you are wanting to lose weight.

**Extreme dieting.**
I wanted to keep this seperate from my ED discussion with reason. While yes, some who suffer through ED also dieting extremely, that isn't always the case. Often, we have individuals who will sign up &amp; create unrealistic calorie goals for themselves . Please consult with your physician before undertaking habits that could *possibly* be counterproductive to your health.

In this post, I’m hoping to answer the question *“Where do I start?”* A lot of the material today is summarized from Tom Venuto’s [Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle](http://www.burnthefat.com/) (highly recommended reading). 

**Where am I now?**

Before you get started figuring out what you want to change, figure out exactly where you are. Write down an initial number for as many things as you can. Some of the easy ones are your weight, body fat percentage, chest/hips/waist measurements (flexible measuring tapes are cheap, no excuses), max number of push-ups/pull-ups/sit-ups, jogging/biking/swimming distance/speed. Even if you’re not specifically aiming to increase one of these stats, measure it anyway. After 90 days, measure again to see what’s changed.

**Estimate your weight**

One of the *least* important stats to track is your weight. Weight fluctuates a lot. Don’t get too caught up in the number. As long as you’re working toward your goals, you can pretty much ignore the number and focus on your progress in other areas. *An increase in weight is not a failure*, it’s noisy data. Keep working hard, keep coming back, keep checking in, and the results will come. 

That said, weight is easy to measure and if it’s averaged over a large sample, it can be a meaningful measure of progress for a group. For those reasons, the weekly check in form will track weight. But again, don’t get too caught up in the number when you check in.

**Estimate your body fat percentage**

One of the *most* important stats to track is your body fat percentage. The weight that you want to work off should be mostly fat, not muscle mass, and the best way to find out if you’re losing fat or muscle is to estimate your body fat percentage. There are lots of ways to get this number. Here are a couple sites to help you find it:

* [Check with your doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage#Measurement_techniques) - these are the most accurate techniques, but they are more difficult to do regularly
* [Calipers or tape measure](http://www.linear-software.com/online.html) - calipers are your best bet for a more accurate home test, the tape measure method is cheap and easy to do on your own
* [Digital scales](http://www.google.com/search?q=body+fat+percentage+scale&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=G&amp;biw=1408&amp;bih=671&amp;prmd=s&amp;source=univ&amp;tbs=shop:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;ei=YL7gTJ6CA4G0lQep79W7Aw&amp;oi=product_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEAQrQQwAg) - these can give a wide range of values throughout the day and depending on room conditions, so try to measure in the same way each time
* [Visually](https://awasteofawaist.wordpress.com/tag/body-fat-percentage/) - an easy first approximation, but this might not be all that accurate 

**Keep records, take before shots**

For all of your initial stats, **write them down**. You don’t have to post them here, but have them written down somewhere.
 
Final step: take pictures! If you’re anything like me, you *don’t* want to take before pictures. If you don’t take them now though, you will really regret it when you’ve made an amazing transformation. Here are some examples of the poses that the P90X program recommends: [NSFW] [1](http://screenflicker.com/mike/images/200902-before_after.jpg), [2](http://i54.tinypic.com/w6ti86.jpg). 

**Where do I want to be?**

Ok, now that we have very specific, numerical values for where we are now, we can move on to where we want to be. To figure out where we want to be, let’s start setting our goals. Setting goals has been the single most helpful thing that I got from Venuto’s book. Here’s a (long) tl;dr version:

* Make **specific, measurable** goals. Pinpoint the weight or waist size that you want to be. Use the visual body fat percentage site above to get an idea of what body fat percentage you’d like to end up at. 
* **Aim high.** You *can* do this. If you really want to make the change, you will accomplish it. Set your goals where you *want* them, not where you think you’ll be able to reach. (Disclaimer: I’m serious, if you *want* this, you *will* get it, so **make sure your goals are healthy** before you start. Try picking something in the middle of the [“healthy” BMI range](http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/). Although BMI isn’t the best measure of body composition, it gives an okay approximation for how low is too low for most people. [Avoid over exercising and under eating to reach your goals.](http://redd.it/o5pje))
* Have **realistic deadlines**. A reasonable guideline for weight loss is about 1-2 lbs (0.5-1 kg) per week, or about 13-26 lbs (6-12 kg) in 90 days. If you need to lose more than this, great! I’ll be here for the next round, and I hope others will stick around with me! You can set your 90-day goals higher than this, but it will mean lots of hard work on your part and you might risk burning yourself out.
* Write **long-term and short-term** goals. Specifically, Venuto suggests the following six types of goals: **1) ultimate long-term goal, 2) one-year goal, 3) 90-days goal, 4) weekly goals, 5) daily goals, and 6) beating your personal best**. Right now, as you’re reading this, get out some paper or open up Notepad and write out those headers. Then start listing them out. Where do you want to be in 5 years? Next year? At the end of this round of 90days? Your weekly goals will help you to know if you’re on track, and your daily goals will help you to take things one step at a time while forming the habits that you’ll need to reach your goals and maintain your new lifestyle once you’ve reached them. 
* Make your goals emotionally charged. Why do you want to reach those goals? Why is it important that you meet them? If you’re trying to lose weight for external reasons, it might not motivate you as much as something that’s extremely personal to you. Make them *your* goals and know *why* those are your goals.
* If your goals conflict with each other, **prioritize** them. If you want to lose weight and gain muscle, you might need to do this in steps - working off the fat with moderate muscle gains, and then building up the muscle with some weight gain. 
* State your goals as **affirmations**. Specifically, Venuto suggests three things for your affirmations: make them **personal**, write them in the **present tense**, and make them **positive**. “At the end of this round, I am extremely happy that I weigh 150 lbs.” Avoid the future tense and negative statements (“By the end of this round, I will have lost 15 lbs”).
* **Read your goals often!** Write out your goals (for real, write them out now) and read over them often. Read your goals when you wake up or when you check your email. Keep them at the front of your mind. 
* **Believe your goals.** When you reread your goals, believe that they are going to happen. Don’t tell yourself you won’t get there, know that you *will* reach those goals. You *want* to get there, and it *will* happen.
* The last thing Venuto recommends is to **visualize** your goals when you read through them. See yourself at the weight you want to be. Make your pictures as vivid as you can. 

**Where do I start?**

I would suggest that you figure out where you stand now and write down your goals for where you want to be. Your goals should get you fired up and ready to go. Once you’ve got your goals written down, keep them somewhere you can see them often. You *really* want these things to happen, you’ve explained *why* you want them to happen, you can *see* them happening, and you know that they *will* happen. That’s a significant first step. 

Once you’ve got them, tell us about your goals for today! Feel free to post your longer term goals too. Ask any questions you have. Answer any questions you’re knowledgeable about. Support and encourage your fellow 90ers!

It's Monday, November 15, 2010 and this is **Day 1** of 90days Round 2!

Over the last couple of days, several of you have posted your reasons that you’re here or the goals that you have for the next three months. These comments have gotten me really excited and I hope they’re doing the same for you guys too. All of us are in this together. We’re all trying to be healthier, fitter, happier people and we’ll all be here when one of us needs help or encouragement.  

There will be another YDG post today for our daily goals, progress, questions, and anything else you might want to post about. In this post though, I’m hoping to answer the question *“Where do I start?”* As I mentioned in yesterday’s post, a lot of the material today is summarized from Tom Venuto’s [Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle](http://www.burnthefat.com/) (BFFM). I highly recommend that you get this book and start reading it as we go. Personally, I really enjoyed reading [The Body Fat Solution](http://www.thebodyfatsolution.com/) by Venuto (I found it at my library - if yours has it, get it now before another 90dger checks it out), and I’m going to be reading through BFFM during this 90days.

**Where am I now?**

Before you get started figuring out what you want to change, I suggest you figure out exactly where you are. Get an initial number for as many things as you can. Some of the easy ones are your weight, BMI, chest/hips/waist measurements (flexible measuring tapes are cheap, I got mine for about 50 cents at a hobby/fabric shop), max number of push-ups/pull-ups/sit-ups, jogging/biking/swimming distance/speed. All of these are on the [goal spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AsOUFG-d9pcodG9vb21TLXZFX3FEV200N2RFTV9tTXc&amp;hl=en). Even if you’re not specifically aiming to increase one of these stats, measure it now anyways. After 90 days, measure it again just to see if there’s a change.

One of the most important stats to track is your body fat percentage. The weight that you want to work off should be mostly fat, not muscle mass, and the best way to find out if you’re losing fat or muscle is to estimate your body fat percentage. There are lots of ways to get this number. Here are a couple sites to help you calculate it:

* [Check with your doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage#Measurement_techniques) - these are the most accurate techniques, but they are more difficult to do regularly

* [Calipers or tape measure](http://www.linear-software.com/online.html) - calipers are probably your best bet for a more accurate home test, the tape measure method is pretty easy to do on your own

* [Digital scales](http://www.google.com/search?q=body+fat+percentage+scale&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=G&amp;biw=1408&amp;bih=671&amp;prmd=s&amp;source=univ&amp;tbs=shop:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;ei=YL7gTJ6CA4G0lQep79W7Aw&amp;oi=product_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEAQrQQwAg) - these can give a wide range of values throughout the day and depending on room conditions, so try to measure in the same way each time

* [Visually](http://askthetrainer.com/fat-loss.html) - an easy first guess, but this probably won’t be very accurate

If you don’t have an estimate for your body fat percentage, estimate it now using whichever method you can. If you want something more accurate than that, then order calipers or schedule an appointment.

For all of your initial stats, **write them down**. They don’t need to be on the spreadsheet here, but have them written down somewhere for yourself and don’t lose them. If you want to use the [spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AsOUFG-d9pcodG9vb21TLXZFX3FEV200N2RFTV9tTXc&amp;hl=en) to write them down, go for it. Having them out there where everyone can see them has been very motivational for me.

Final step: take pictures! If you’re anything like me, you don’t want to take before pictures. If you don’t take them now though, you will really regret it when you’ve made an amazing transformation. Here are some examples of the poses that the P90X program recommends: [1](http://screenflicker.com/mike/images/200902-before_after.jpg), [2](http://i54.tinypic.com/w6ti86.jpg), [3](http://www.dennisgetsfit.com/before-after.jpg). Ask someone to take your pictures for you or set your camera on the table and use the self-timer. If neither of those options work, take some mirror shots.

**Where do I want to be?**

Ok, now that we have very specific, numerical values for where we are now, we can move on to where we want to be. To figure out where we want to be, let’s start setting our goals. Setting goals has been the single most helpful thing that I got from Venuto’s The Body Fat Solution.

* He suggests that you make **specific**, **measurable** goals - pinpoint the weight or waist size that you want to be. You can use the visual body fat percentage site above to get an idea of where you’d like to end up. For me, I set weight, body fat percentage, pants size, and jogging goals, with specific numbers for each. Not all of my goals were realistic (I had never jogged before, so my goal was kind of crazy), but I wrote them down and tracked my progress for them.

* **Aim high.** You *can* do this. If you really want to make the change, you will accomplish it. Set your goals where you *want* them, not where you think you’ll be able to reach.

* Have **realistic deadlines**. A reasonable guideline for weight loss is about 1-2 lbs per week, or about 13-26 lbs in 90 days. If you need to lose more than this, great! I’ll be here for Round 3, and I hope others will stick around with me! You can set your goals higher than this, but it will mean lots of hard work on your part and you might risk burning yourself out.

* Write **long-term and short-term** goals. Specifically, Venuto suggests the following six types of goals: **1) ultimate long-term goal, 2) one-year goal, 3) 90-days goal, 4) weekly goals, 5) daily goals, and 6) beating your personal best**. Right now, as you’re reading this, get out some paper or open up Notepad and write out those headers. Then start listing them out. Where do you want to be in 5 years? Next year? At the end of this round of 90days? Your weekly goals will help you to know if you’re on track, and your daily goals will help you to take things one step at a time while forming the habits that you’ll need to reach your goals and maintain your new lifestyle once you’ve reached them. This is absolutely my favorite quote from Venuto: “Tell yourself, ‘All I have is today. All I have is this moment, this workout, this meal, the next 30 minutes, the next hour. If I just do what I know I must do now, then I know I’ll reach my ultimate goal eventually.’” Seriously tell yourself this. It stopped me from pigging out on more than one occasion during the past 90 days.

* Your goals should be **emotionally charged**. Why do you want to reach those goals? Why is it important that you meet them?  If you’re trying to lose weight for external reasons, it might not motivate you as much as something that’s extremely personal to you. When I asked my mom about her goals at the start of Round 1, she told me they were a little too personal to tell me, which is awesome. Those goals, whatever they might be, are *hers*. She wants those things badly and they mean a lot to her, and because of them, she has stayed motivated and made great progress over the last three months. Make them *your* goals and know *why* those are your goals.

* If your goals conflict with each other, **prioritize** them. If you want to lose weight and gain muscle, you might need to do this in steps - working off the fat with  moderate muscle gains, and then building up the muscle with some weight gain.

* State your goals as **affirmations**. Specifically, Venuto suggests three things for your affirmations: make them **personal**, write them in the **present tense**, and make them **positive**. As an example, here’s one of mine: “On February 12, I am extremely happy that I weigh 150 lbs.” Avoid the future tense and negative statements (“By February 12, I will have lost 15 lbs”).

* **Read your goals often!** Write out your goals (for real, write them out now) and read over them often. Read your goals when you wake up or when you check your email. Keep them at the front of your mind. And better yet, Venuto writes: “If you want to amplify the effect of the affirmation technique even more, don’t just read your affirmations; *write them out by hand every single day*.”

* **Believe your goals.** When you reread your goals, believe that they are going to happen. Don’t tell yourself you won’t get there, know that you *will* reach those goals. You *want* to get there, and it *will* happen.

* The last thing Venuto recommends is to **visualize** your goals when you read through them. See yourself at the weight you want to be, with the toned muscles that you’ll have. Make your pictures as vivid as you can.


** Where do I start? **

If that’s the question on your mind, I would suggest that you figure out where you stand now and write down your goals for where you want to be. Your goals should get you fired up and ready to go. Once you’ve got your goals written down, keep them somewhere you can see them often. You *really* want these things to happen, you’ve explained *why* you want them to happen, you can see them happening, and you know that they will happen. That’s a significant first step.

Everything should be written down *somewhere*, whether it be on the spreadsheet here or on a spreadsheet for yourself or on a text file on your computer. Feel free to post your goals here or start your own thread or guard them closely (after all, they should be emotional!). If you’re not sure how to form your goals, take a look at some of the other goals that people post or ask questions here to get some ideas. Coming tomorrow, healthy eating!

How is everyone doing today?  If you haven't already [signed up for Round 11](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDBCbWtGMkVJaWp6OFlzT1FuZHphaXc6MA#gid=0), please take a moment to do so now.


Today's topic is **Diets**:

We have people following all kinds of diets here, so I'll try to keep this reasonably general. Here are a couple things that I've picked up over the last few rounds:

* *Don't diet!  Instead, change your eating habits*. Figure out your weaknesses and try to tackle those this round. Do you eat a whole bag of candy before you realize it's gone? Do you have big weekend binges after a week of healthy eating? Does drinking make you eat more? Do you tend to eat late at night? Do you eat when you're bored/stressed/alone/with friends? Do salty snacks make you crave more salty things? Do sugary snacks make you crave more sugary things? Figure out your triggers and try to recognize your old habits before you fall into them.

* *Listen to your body*. Lots of people end up eating too little when they're trying to lose weight. If you're feeling drained or moody, it might be because you aren't giving your body enough fuel. That doesn't mean you should blindly start eating more though. No matter what diet you're following, I think it's useful for everyone to calculate their BMR and target calories for the weight loss rate they'd like to reach. (There's more info about this [here](http://90daysgoal.com/getting-started/food-and-diet) &amp; [here](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/).) Then, without changing your diet, try tracking everything that you eat, every day, for a week or so. MyFitnessPal, LiveStrong, LoseIt, or other similar sites should be pretty useful here. How close do you get to your target calories? If you're way below, add in some fruits and veggies and other small snacks to round out your day. If you're way over, maybe look for some alternatives to some of the biggest contributors.

* *Don't deprive yourself -- strive for moderation*. Swearing off french fries or ice cream for the rest of your life is... mind boggling. I don't think I could do it. Eating enormous portions of fries and ice cream on a splurge day because you haven't had them in forever isn't a great idea either though. Work toward a middle road. Maybe allow yourself a small splurge once a month. Try to stick to a single serving and really savor it.

* *You can lose weight and still drink alcohol*. You'll have to be pretty good about it. Make some food compromises, watch what you're eating the rest of the day, aim for moderation, and savor every sip. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on alcohol might be an easy way to push through it.

* *You can lose weight and still eat bread/pasta/potatoes/rice/sweets*. Again, you'll just have to be good about it. Small servings of starchy/carby foods aren't going to derail your progress. But if your day consists of a bagel, a sandwich with potato chips, and pasta with a baked potato and a piece of pie, you might want to consider scaling back on the carbs and adding a lot of fruits and veggies. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on carbs might be an easy way to push through it.

* *A specific diet might work for lots of people, but that doesn't mean it will work for you*. Try it out, see how you feel, see how your weight responds, gauge how hard it will be for you to keep it up long-term. If it doesn't seem to be working for you, try to figure out which part seems to be the problem.

* *The end goal is a long-term, sustainable change to your eating habits*. Quick weight loss has a pretty high relapse rate. If you're nearing your long-term weight goals, start setting out a maintenance plan for yourself. Don't let yourself slip back into old bad habits. Keep an eye on your weight. Set an alarm weight for yourself, probably 5-10 lbs above your long-term goal weight. If you ever go above that weight, it's time to re-examine your eating habits and make sure you're still following your maintenance plan.

* That being said, I would like to briefly touch on the topic of *Eating Disorders*.  This was discussed in a post a few rounds ago, but I feel that it bears repeating.  What all of us want for you, as a member of 90daysgoal, is to find your niche, to eat healthy.  Eating can cause anxiety and stress -- especially when doing something new.  Stay away from dangerous dieting that could become counter productive to your health and well-being.  As it says in the first bullet, try and figure out your triggers &amp; stay away from behavior that could spiral you back into old habits.  Please know that we are always here if you need a sounding board.  BUT please also know that we cannot replace the expertise of a trained professional like a couselor or therapist.

With that in mind, let's talk about you!  What are your diet/eating habit plans for this round?  Do you have any questions about any diet you are interested in?  Do you have any questions about a diet you are already following?  

And how did you do yesterday?  Did you meet your goals?  What do you have on your agenda for the day?  It's Day 2, people!  Let's keep the momentum alive!

Have fun!

Today is day 4 of our journey and we have a few different things to make a note of today. First off how is your day today? Doing anything interesting in the name of fitness? What do you plan to do today to further yourself towards your goals? Let us know!

First things first is to sign up if you havent already! [**Round 10 signup form**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGFHemRiLVliQWgzR3ItOXJXQlI0YlE6MA#gid=0). If you have any questions about the form, feel free to ask them here.

We had toyed with some groups before in the past and it turns out to be a modding nightmare when we tried to split it up enough. We found that with a few larger groups though we are able to help more people by being more consistent. In these groups you will find posts for Runners, Fitocracy, and definitely Women Losing Weight. 

I may not be a woman but I am happy to see that so many are able to band together to work on bettering themselves. Anyone is allowed to participate in any group so hop right in and chat it up.
 

Now for some basic info we want to let you know about:

* Don't miss the start of the [Sprint 1 Fitocracy challenges](http://redd.it/1axeeo)! 

* Women Losing Weight posts will happen on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. 

Go forth and be fit!

It's very true! She said it in a normal, casual way, just like she would tell him he needed to wash his hands before eating or something. It just reminded me how important our attitude towards food is when we want to eat healthier, and I think most of us might forget that simple thing she said there. 

Another thing I've noticed while staying here is leftovers. They will leave tiny amount of foods as leftovers. In my family we rarely have leftovers at all, we'll always make an effort to empty the pots and pans, even if it means getting uncomfortably full. Here they'll put half a sausage and 3 slices of tomato in the fridge. That small amount of food isn't a lot, but if that means you eat a little bit less every day than over a year that might be what you need to do to maintain your weight, or even lose some.

So, the first week is almost over. We talked about and set goals, we discussed diets and workouts, organized groups and buddies, now is the time to reflect on how you are doing  in all of this. This is the time for feedback here. Do you need help setting goals? Have diet / exercise questions? Are we moving too fast / too slow? Tell us what is going on, talk with us. One think I'd like to state as well, even though it seems at times that only a mod submits a thread, feel free to do so if you feel you have a question that is not answered in the comments or something completely different to act. We rather want more content than we do worry about a cluttered front page. Before I forget, please upvote the threads here, so that we get mover visibility on our front-pages.

The most prominent change for 90daysgoal in this round is the introduction of sprints rather than having just 90 days. This is the schedule for this round:

--------------------------------------------------------

- Sprint 1: Days 1-30 (April 23 - May 22)

- Recovery: 5 days (May 23 - May 27)

- Sprint 2: Days 31-60 (May 28 – June 26)

- Recovery: 5 days (June 27 – July 1)

- Sprint 3: Days 61-90 (July 2 – July 31)

--------------------------------------------------------

Now why did we do that? Well as of most of the things here it is about keeping the people motivated. Experienced showed us that 90 days is a very long time and many people (me included) felt exhausted the closer we come to the end. In other words, it is very hard to give 110% for such a long time without having a short breather in between. That it encourages people to ""at least finish that sprint and see how I am after the break"" kind of way. Now we are not saying how you spent the recovery period. Practically this will be about goal setting, a time where we reflect how we are doing goal wise, if we need adjustments for the next period and in-between progress posts. Of course break periods can be beneficial as well, but as always here, you have to find your own flow, we just hope that this structure will help people staying on that road.

My last point, is bringing up [Fitocracy](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/sthv7/fitocracy_sprint_1_challenges/) again. Considering that we are having private challenges now and even cut down a bit on the challenges compared to last round the turnout is actually quite good. After roughly a day we are having about 84 people taking part in the challenges (includes duplicates, I added the people in the groups together) and at least, with the exception of one group, at least 10 members per group. I am sure we can still do better, so to beat the drum here again, [I encourage you to take part in our Fitocracy challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/sthv7/fitocracy_sprint_1_challenges/) as a means to keep you motivated. Please note that the deadline for the first set of challenges (we will be having one each sprint) is the **4th of May**. So join till then. And also as experience tells me, some people join the groups yet forget to join the challenge, so it does not hurt to check your group and **make sure that you clicked the ""JOIN CHALLENGE"" button**.

Before we end, please give us feedback. Thanks! Oh and have a nice weekend...

**PS:** The people conducting the survey need more participants. If you want to take part, take a look [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/sv1q0/dailygoal_day_5_april_27_2012/c4h8nmc).

**Now let's check in!**

How much weight did we lose as a group last week? How many people are still working toward their goals? Let's find out! [**Fill out the form here.**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDFHdVRlMEwzNHZ4UmgwN1NuZW9MSnc6MA#gid=0)

Please keep in mind that weight is a noisy number. You can stick to your calorie goals and exercise routines perfectly and still see your weight jump up some days, just to mess with your head. *Do not be discouraged if your weight went up this week.* All we really care about is the trend over time, and the only way to know the trend over time is to keep writing down that weight, even on days that it jumps up.

The check-ins will let us see our group progress, but it is also important to keep up with your individual progress. If you would like to see your individual progress, [physicsdiet.com](http://physicsdiet.com/) is an excellent tracker that will give you information about your weight trends. (edit: looks like physicsdiet might be a little buggy right now. If you already track your weight, let us know your favorite place to do so!) Most calorie trackers will also show you a plot of your weight over time.

I can still weigh myself everyday, so im keeping in check. But two weeks after the first time i measured myself, i had only lost 1lb on the scale, but entirely i had lost an entire inch off both my waist and my thighs.

This is a ""duh"" statement for me. But what I ACTUALLY want is to walk down the street and have someone think, ""damn, she's hot!"" when I'm wearing my normal clothes and standing with a normal posture.

A lot of Redditors have seen pictures that make me LOOK like I'm thin but... I'm not. Sure, I'm not what I'd call ""fat"" but my photos are all unrepresentative of the real me. I'm REALLY good at creative camera angles, sucking in my stomach, holding my arms up, bending in just a certain way...

The reality is that my clothes are digging in (and I don't quite have a budget to upgrade them all - so, let's downgrade me!), when I stand upright with a normal posture, from the back I have fat rolls. When I don't suck in my stomach, I kind of look like I'm well into pregnancy (and have had kids at my prior work come up to me and ask me just that, as well as one or two of the elders :/ ). I'm sleeping shitty. Really shitty. I get worn out faster than I'd like doing regular activities (including sex which is embarrassing at times). On the whole... I'm just not super pleased with my physique and I'd like to change that.

In the past I ate a paleo diet and found that unless I did it 100% all the time (usually people do the 80% on, 20% leeway) I would totally not keep up with it. ""Well, but one crescent for breakfast wont hurt... aw hell, since I'm eating that, might as well get the bagel sandwich for lunch... mmm... today is going to be my 20% day and I'm having ICE CREAM!"" and then, soon enough, the whole week went by like that just eating crap all the time. I LOVED how I felt, slept, and looked at the end of just a 6 week period of eating 100% paleo and I wish to get back into it.

My biggest problem is that, like someone else mentioned, I've stagnated in the recipes I make. I want more variety. I keep eating almost the exact same thing every time I try to go paleo and I can't do it like that. That's why I've been eating out nearly every day, sometimes a couple or more times per day, for months. This is not how I want it to be.

On top of that, I just barely went on two dates with someone who is REALLY in shape. Super duper sexy in shape and I feel like a ball of squish when I compare my fitness level to his. He has impressive stamina and I would like to have that for myself as well.

I tried doing this on facebook a while ago - where I'd post photos of myself weekly when I had started a walk-3-miles-a-day regimen and... yeah. That lasted all of... once. So... I'm going to throw myself out there into this forum (especially since I don't use facebook anymore) and post totally embarrassing photos of myself. I wont suck in my belly. I wont raise my arms or take 25 pictures just to get 1 that catches a great angle... and I'm going to allow you, dear Redditors, to hold me accountable.


Where I am now:

*I eat reasonable but inconsistently

*I eat out almost daily or more

*My bedtime and wake times are ALL over the place

*I don't know exactly what I weigh right now (don't have a scale) but will go to a friend's house tonight or tomorrow and get a measurement and have him take pics to post as a starting point - but last time I was at a doctor's office a month or so ago I was 163 or 165 or something in that range.


Where I would like to be:

*100% paleo diet (exception for my Halloween party, holidays meals with family, my birthday, and other RARE special occasions like someone's wedding which I don't anticipate to occur until next summer)

*Bringing my food to work daily, and when I am unable, to eat out at a paleo friendly restaurant such as Mongolian BBQ rather than what happens to be close by

*Pick a bedtime and stick to it Sunday through Thursday nights - keep Friday and Saturday nights not TOO far from that bedtime (this would probably be easier if I set a time to turn off the computer and maybe go read a book for 20 minutes to rest my brain)

*Eventually, I'd like to be 125 pounds and maintain that weight
-In the meantime, my 90 Days' Goal will be to get to 135 pounds


Commitments at this time for which you all can hold me accountable. By the end of tomorrow (Monday):

*I will post my actual weight once I get on a scale

*Anyone that is or is trying to get into eating a paleo diet as well, please feel free to connect up with me and let's encourage each other, share recipe ideas and so forth so our menus don't get so stagnant that we stop.

*Anyone that would like to create some co-accountability with me (I hold you accountable to what you say you will do, you hold me accountable to what I say I will do), please feel free to get in touch. I'm good at holding people accountable so long as they are willing to be held accountable (don't get all cranky at me if I follow up with you for what YOU said you would do when you ASKED me to do so lol) and I do really well with the occasional cattle prod to my own motivation and accountability as well.

Lastly, if you've read this far, you rock and thank you. :)

TL,DR: Let's motherfucking DO this! :D

Before we get into our normal daily goal post, I'd like to mention a few things about how 90days works and how you might want to get things started.

**How does 90days work?**

90days is a tool for motivation and accountability. Every day, we'll start off with a daily goal post where you can check in with your plans and goals for the day, or your successes or setbacks from the day before. Some people have very quick goal posts, others are more detailed and structured. Write as much or as little as you want. Write daily, weekly, or just read other 90ers' updates for motivation.

Every week we'll have a check-in form. The link will be posted on Monday and it will be stickied to the sidebar. If you signed up for email reminders, I'll send you an email with the check-in link on Monday. Please let me know if you ever want me to stop sending emails. The information from the check-in form will be used to gather our group statistics. How much weight do we lose/gain as a group each week? 

If you signed up for weekly emails *and* monthly or end-of-round PMs, the email will trump the PM. So if I have your email address, but you asked for a monthly PM reminder, by default I'll send the monthly reminder as an email, not a PM. Sending PMs takes way more time, so I'd like to limit it to the 90ers who didn't want to give out an email address. If you still want the monthly or end-of-round reminders as PM, let me know and I'll make sure you stay on the PM list.

**How should I get started?**

I think the single most important thing for everyone to do today is to *write down a list of your short-term and long-term goals*. You can start with the easy things, like what weight or body fat percentage you'd like to reach by the end of 90 days, a year, and in the long term. But a longer, more detailed and emotional list will give you more motivation to stick with this. If you aren't sure what your goals are, or if your only goal is to lose/gain weight, take today to put together a more complete list. There are two posts on the sidebar ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/fu9ll/todo_welcome_and_goalsetting/) and [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/e6cp3/90dg_day_1_where_are_we_now_and_where_do_we_want/)) to help you set your goals. 

We'll work on our diet and exercise routines tomorrow, but for today, let's just write down our goals. Feel free to post them here if you'd like, but since your goals may be emotionally charged, you won't necessarily want to share them with everyone on the internet. By the end of the day, I hope everyone will have a physical list of their goals somewhere. Keep it by your bed, on your fridge, locked in a journal, or right in your wallet. Write it down and look at it as often as you can. 

Also, if you haven't already done so, make sure to fill out the [sign up form](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&amp;formkey=dFFMMmhxem9SQ3ZXTjFBQ2lOdFYtM1E6MA#gid=2) and feel free to [introduce yourself and meet your fellow 90ers](http://redd.it/hwfdr). 

If you're not sure what to do, ask! You can ask here, start a thread, message the mods, or PM another 90er. 

So let's get started! What are your plans and goals for today? for the round? long term?

For the next three months, we will be embarking on a wild, crazy quest to gain a healthier, better you. Along the way, we will fight off laziness, find the willpower to workout (and later realize turn that into a habit), gain entry into the Mines of Moria (speak friend. . .), and have random encounters with every opposing factor that comes with making yourself better.   

(Okay, no more puns for now, I promise.)   

What is unique about this, if you are joining us for the first time, is that there is no one trainer, but we are all our own unique trainers and support. Here, and on the other subreddits, you will find like-minded individuals, either wanting to put on muscle or lose weight or something in between, that can help you in your journey. There is no paid service, no pro-level, no gimmicks, no secret handshake, and no fads—just personal investment in a future result. While we all have our own individual needs, please do use the resources available and, if you have something that works exceptionally well, do not hesitate to share it.   

This is an interactive community—no one individual is in charge, not even us moderators. While we might offer more contributions, most (if not all) of us are part of this journey as well, and we have our own successes and failures. It is our “job” to keep things running smoothly and to find new and exciting materials from various sources.  We did a survey after Round II, and we appreciate your input as it is the only way we can make any changes from the day-to-day operation. We noticed trends and suggestions, and we will deliver on what we can. We will try to give you more resources, more guideposts, and ultimately help provide the motivation to get you through to the next level. If you want to see something, send us a message—we do listen and we will always try our best to help you do your best.   

If you are looking for an environment that will tell you what to do, that is unfortunately not what we provide. While we will make resources available and offer any advice we can on a given subject, ultimately you make the calls for your own life. Not all of us have access to the same foods, materials, or equipment, and some of us have special requirements (physically, emotionally, or nutritionally) that must be met. So please, use us as a resource and a support rather than a guide.   

Now, before we begin, it is important to mention that none of us here are doctors or fitness experts (unless some of us are, in which case kudos!). As such, we are not a substitute for either—it is HIGHLY recommended that you do speak with a doctor before beginning any diet or exercise regimen. Additionally, while we can make suggestions as to what to focus on for exercising as well as provide resources on how to correct form, the best way to get personalized critique and live help is through the use of a fitness expert.   

With that out of the way, let us look at ourselves. Obviously, we all have our own motivations and desires to gain outside of being healthy. We all have our own goals, wishes, and plans to make this a reality. So, on this first day, let us take a page out of Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle (BFFM). You knew this talk was coming, but it really is important to make a personalized listing of your own goals and desires, because without an end destination, it is pointless to even set sail.  

Tom Venuto, the author of BFFM, actually makes a good point: “Nothing great was ever achieved by being realistic!”. So, for this, do not set goals that are easily achieved. Go big and go wild. While there certainly are genetic limitations, in the end you are the greatest limitation on your own self. So, if you want to have that movie star body as your end goal, do not put down that your end goal is to lose ten pounds!   

While I am borrowing rather extensively from BFFM for this exercise, rest assured that other materials will come into play, especially the further along that we go. So, I have a minor, written exercise that we all should do prior to beginning:   

1)  **Set Specific Goals.** Let us not be general and say things like “I want to lose weight” or “I want to gain muscle mass.” Let us use exact numbers and exact terms for what we want and how we want it.  

* Exactly how many pounds do you want to lose?  

* When do you want to complete your goal?  

* How much body fat do you want to lose?  

* How much do you want to weigh?  

* What measurements would you like to have?  

* What size clothes do you want to wear?  

Write all of this down and, at least once a day, read over it. Share it with friends or us if you want, but it is very important that we have these goals in mind and written down. Do note that wanting the completely illogical (losing 100 pounds in ninety days) may be unhealthy, so we should try to make our goals not only amazing, but healthy. You can certainly set a long-term goal of losing 100 pounds, but break this up into healthy, smaller goals of say 20-30 pounds in ninety days.   

2)  Once we have done this, let us **set even more goals**, ones that might be a bit more personal to you and that you do not necessarily have to share.  

* What is your ultimate long-term goal?  

* What is your 12 month goal?  

* What are your three month goals?  

* What are your weekly goals?  

* What are your daily goals?  

While you do not have to share any of these, it is important to not only know them, but to also know why these goals are important to you. While you can gather inspiration from others and their goals and reasoning, at the end of the day your own inspiration must come from within, and your own personal muse must be the betterment of your own self.  

Do you want to look like someone famous for their physique? Do you want to impress anyone? Do feel like you need to prove something? Do you want more energy? Do you want more self-confidence? Do you want to look your best? Do you want to feel your best?  

Any of these reasons, as well as any other ones, are completely valid. Take from that your motivation—if it is to look like someone, tape a picture of them next to your goals. Keep visual reminders of your goal so that every time you feel down, or that you are progressing slowly, or that it is just pointless, you can give yourself the kick you need to get back into it.  

Your own health is not something you can merely try to upkeep. It takes hard work, perseverance, and your own drive. I tend not to quote fictional characters, but Yoda said it best: “Do or do not; there is no try.” While we welcome everyone, do understand that this is not a commitment to us, but to your current and future self. So, even if all you can do is a little to begin with, give it your all. Stay healthy, stay safe, and stay strong.  

Yes, there will be difficult days, and there will be some who do not stick around for all 90 days. But, that is fine—the difficult days get better, and any attempt to better yourself is better than none. However, do not let yourself fall into thinking that you will join in next time around, or that you are just not ready for this. There is no time like now, and in matters of your health, now is the best time to make positive changes.  

Even if you are joining us late—day twenty, day fifty, or even day ninety, there is no better time than to begin making positive changes for yourself. Join in and participate whenever—there is always the next leg if you want to fully participate in this goal. In our minds, there is no such thing as a full member or a better member: the only possibility is a better you and a long, fulfilled life.  

So again, welcome to Round Three, everyone. We wish you the best of successes and are with you every step of the way. Whether this is your first time, or your third time, stay strong and stay moving.

1375151014.0,17,self.90daysgoal,1jbkzq,[Tasty Tuesday] Slow Cookers,19,2,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1jbkzq/tasty_tuesday_slow_cookers/,"This week we’ll talk about Slow Cookers.  Slow cookers can be a life saver for a person with a busy schedule -- and how many of us have one of those.  For those of you who aren’t familiar with one, a slow cooker is a special counter-top appliance which is designed to, well, cook food slowly - over the course of a day - and then keep the food warm.

They come in various sizes - from 1 ½ quarts to 6 or more.  Small ones are appropriate for dips, sauces, side dishes and sauces, while the larger ones also work great on soups, main courses and desserts.  The largest ones are great when you have a large cut of meat, pot roast, pork, or brisket.

For most of us, a medium sized one (4 quarts or so) would be an appropriate size for every day use.

Slow cookers normally have two settings - low and high.  Low is typically used for recipes that will be cooking all day (7 or 8 hours) while high is used for something that is done faster, or to give the recipe a ‘head start’ before cooking it on low.

When you’re cooking in a slow cooker, you want to use tougher cuts of meat like stewing beef, pot roasts, or pork shoulders.  Chicken thighs should be used instead of breasts.  Don’t even think of cooking premium cuts of meat or poultry - the results will be dry and unappealing.

If you’re adapting a stovetop recipe to a slow cooker, reduce any liquids (including canned tomatos) by about 50%.

Be generous with aromatic ingredients (celery, garlic, etc).  Long cooking dulls their flavour so you need to compensate with more.  You may want to finish the recipe with fresh herbs or citrus juice to give it a ‘pick-me-up’.

Use whole herbs and spices instead of ground ones if possible.  They will release their flavours slowly throughout the cooking process.

Milk products should be added near the end of the cooking process.

In general, your slow cooker should be no less than half full, and no more than three quarters full.  Leave at least 2 inches between the top of the food and the lid.

I’m relatively new to slow-cooking, but its something I’ve started to try to use, and something I want to use more of come September, when life starts returning to normal after summer.  I’ve been looking at the ‘Best of Bridge’ Slow Cooker cookbook, as well as /r/slowcooking. There are some excellent links to slow cooker recipe sites from there.

Do you use a slow cooker?  How do you like it?  Now, lets hear about a recipe that you like, or that you would like to try!

Can you believe we're at the end of week 2 already?!  How are you doing today?  What do you have planned?  What did you do yesterday?

Earlier, we touched upon motivation and why we're all doing what we're doing.  Now that we're at the end of the second week and the honeymoon is over, I want to discuss **accountability**.

How are you going to hold yourself accountable for what you need to do and what you have done?  Do you get other people involved?  Do you use that gym app where you have to put money into a pot and if you don't work out, you lose that money (I can't remember what it's called)?  Do you have any visual references to keep yourself accountable, like calendars or beads in a jar?  What do you do if you don't stick to your plan, especially for a long time?  Is there a consequence to not working out or not sticking to your diet?  

Hope everyone has an awesome weekend!

Sunday morning is a great time to reflect on your past week as well as plan your upcoming week. My week plan always starts with what I call my Optimal Week - what should my normal week look like if I want to accomplish the things I need to achieve my goals. 

Here’s an example of my Optimal Week. 

* Sunday - Weekly Plan, Lift
* Monday - Publish management blog, Easy Run
* Tuesday - Lift and/or Yoga
* Wednesday - Golf or Run, dependent on weather
* Thursday - Publish Technical Blog, Lift
* Friday - Tempo Run
* Saturday - Golf or Running, Technology free day

What does your optimal week look like?

More times than not, this is my week. But life doesn't always happen like this. So Sunday is my day to sit down, figure out what is not going to happen as planned and plan for it. Here's what my week looks like this week. 

* Sunday - Weekly Plan, Lift
* Monday - Publish management blog, Easy Run
* Tuesday - Lift and/or Yoga
* Wednesday - Run in morning, lunch with someone and a users group meeting at 6:30, with pizza involved. 
* Thursday - Publish Technical Blog, Lift
* Friday - Run in morning, Vacation day, work quarterly meeting
* Saturday - Daughter’s birthday party, afternoon walk to the park

Really quickly I can see three different things this week that I will need to address to ensure I stay within my calorie goals and make sure I get my workouts in. On Weds, since I have a late meeting I will get up and run in the morning to make sure I burn the calories I need to handle both lunch out as well as a possible run in with dreaded pizza. I will also make sure on Weds to bring a filling, healthy snack to eat around 4 or 5 to reduce my appetite prior to pizza. Friday I will get up and run early and Saturday, I will make sure just to eat prior to everyone getting there and limit myself to one cupcake. Saturday MIGHT put me over my calorie limit, but there is nothing stopping me from going out that afternoon or evening for a walk to burn the excess. 

So there’s my plan for the week. What does your week look like?

I may not be a woman but I am happy to see that so many are able to band together to work on bettering themselves. It is awesome to see. If you fit into one of these categories you are more than welcome to join into the discussions.

Also if you have not done so please check out the sidebar specifically to sign up for this new round of 90days or to look into the Questionnaire! These are important components of our round this time. 

Now for some basic info we want to let you know about:

* There will be three sets of month-long Fitocracy challenges this time. No weekly or 90-day challenges. The challenges will be private, so that only 90ers may participate. The signups [have started in Feckless's Post, check it out for more details](http://redd.it/sthv7).

* Paleo/vegetarian/vegan/keto posts are all going to be wrapped up into the food posts by princessbitchtits. She'll be posting every Saturday.

* Couch to 5K and Bridge to 10K - posted every Sunday, let's have a big group running through the Couch to 5K and Bridge to 10K programs together this round. All levels and running programs are welcome. There will be a post with details on Sunday.

Go forth and be fit!

[Yesterday](http://redd.it/oatkk) we discussed diet, and if there are any questions remaining, please feel free to ask.  We love questions and feedback.

Today's topic is *exercise*.

---

Some general tips:

* You can lose weight without exercise, but it's going to be more difficult, slower, and you'll likely end up losing muscle in addition to fat.

* The better route for weight loss is to incorporate activities into your daily routines to *get you up and moving and using your muscles more than you did before*. Whatever level of activity you're at now, try ramping it up a bit. That might mean taking the stairs instead of the elevator or adding a walk after dinner. Or it might mean lifting heavier weights at the gym or running a bit faster on your next jog.
Our [Daily Challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/obtba/daily_challenge_wednesday_january_11_2012/) are a great way to keep yourself moving throughout the day.

* *Track your progress*. It's too easy to get bored with your routines if you don't have a way to measure your progress. Even just keeping a paper log of your lifts can help you here. If you're going to be jogging, running, swimming, biking, ellipticalling, or any other cardio, try measuring your speed, distance, duration, or whatever other metric you'd like to use. After a few weeks go by, flip back to the start of your log so you can see how far you've come.

* *Push yourself*. If your chosen activities don't get your heart rate up, then you should probably add in something that's a little more challenging to you.

* Cardio is great, but *cardio plus weight lifting is* **much** *better*. There are lots of reasons to add weight lifting. The simplest is that you'll build or maintain muscle as you lose fat, which will prevent you from getting to a low weight with a high body fat percentage. Ladies: don't be afraid to lift heavy.

* Some programs that everyone seems to love: [Couch to 5K](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) (to move from no running experience to being able to run a 5K), [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_Strength_Wiki), [StrongLifts 5x5.](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/) and the [100 push up program](http://www.hundredpushups.com/).

* *Don't be afraid of the gym*. Everybody had to start somewhere and everybody is focused on their own routines. Keep going back for more and you'll see some major transformations in your body.  /r/Fitness's FAQ has [a good section on what to expect at the gym and proper etiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness#GymEtiquette).

* *Do something fun*. Go for a hike, play some basketball, go rafting.

* Tip from andyleclair: ""If you don't have any equipment, but want to check out body weight training, [this post](http://nerdfitness.com/blog/2009/12/09/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/) on nerd fitness is a great place to start. It's a full circuit workout, and the only equipment needed is a gallon jug filled with water. There's also a nice video explaining the exercises"".

* Some free resources that one should at least skim through is the [r/fitness faq](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness) and the [brain over brawn ebook](http://brainoverbrawn.com/get-the-book/).

* Good sites to look up exercises include [ExRx](http://exrx.net/), [Bodybuilding.com (with many videos)](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/) and [workout-routine](http://www.workout-routine.com/workout-routines.html).

* If you haven't done so already, join [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/register/?invite_code=XF3Y2). It gives you a good overview on what your fellow 90DGers are doing and will include [our new fitness challenges](http://redd.it/oba50).  Note that there are limited Fitocracy invites. If we run out, please tell the mods so we can get more.

For those of you that have just started with 90DaysGoal and/or have never participated in the Daily Challenge, every week day, a new challenge is posted.  The challenge will consist of several body weight exercises that can be done *anywhere* - at home, in an empty office at work, an empty classroom, etc.  I usually do mine at work, at the end of a hallway near an emergency exit.

During the course of the day, everyone should do multiple sets of the exercises, and post an update listing how many reps they did for each.

If any of the exercises are too difficult, or painful due to injury, respond back to me and I'll post an alternative exercise.

Today's challenge consists of my two favorite abdominal exercises:

* [Planks](http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abexercises_10.htm) (if you cannot do an extended plank, you can [use your knees](http://0.tqn.com/d/exercise/1/0/D/b/modifiedplank.jpg)) 
* [Crunches](http://www.fitstep.com/Library/Exercises/Crunches.htm)

Try to do at least 3 sets of each.

Remember - we're all at different fitness levels, so don't feel embarrassed if you can't do the same durations/# reps as others.  Use it as fuel for your fire to become more fit.  


As always, if anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask!

So, how are you guys doing? Any plans? Goals? Setbacks?

For me, well things are certainly not running smooth here. Had my holidays and gained some kilos (certainly not muscle mass), my leg is still injured so no cardio, had a spectacular huge fight with my wife (and the tension is not going to go away soon), my daughter is sick again (so no sleep for me) and on top of that, it seems to me I have fucked up at work as well.

There is a silver lining at the horizon though, with the routine back in place I believe I will lose some weight, therapy might help my leg and most of the time after a bad night Laura will be fit again. Oh and I stopped chewing nails since the round started.

Let me start by giving a little bit of a history of this group and then I’ll go into a brief outline of what we’re hoping to do for the next 90 days.

**Original r/90days**

As some of you might remember, there was a stir-up a few months ago on r/Fitness (or at least, that’s where I saw it happen). A man promised to commit 90 days of his life to any Redditor who wanted to completely transform his or her body, regardless of weight or fitness level. It was a pretty amazing promise, and nearly 2000 Redditors subscribed to the subreddit, eager to turn their lives around. When things fell through with the original r/90days, some people lost motivation or didn’t know how to get started on their own, but [not everyone stopped in their tracks](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/e21qr/90_days_is_up_results/). In the original Day 1 post at r/90days, the man wrote “Don’t underestimate the powerful benefits of having the support of a community who are sharing the same journey.” That is exactly what we have tried to create at r/90daysgoal, a place where everyone is trying to better themselves and help others. And here we are, 90 days later, and I think we have made some pretty significant changes to our bodies, habits, and lifestyles.

**The past 90 days at r/90daysgoal**

We’ve been using this subreddit as a place to tell each other about the breakthroughs and problems that we’ve been having with our eating habits and exercise routines. We’ve posted tips, questions, motivational materials, and lots of encouragement, and overall, I think the results have been pretty great. Although we lost a lot of our regular posters over time, we finished our three months with a nice sized crowd remaining. On our final day, we had 17 people (or about 8% of the people subscribed to the reddit) report their final stats, which can be seen [here](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AjcJ6GpNQiUKdDdXUE50WXdEUmJlNlpacGNsWjlRaFE&amp;hl=en). There are some more complete stats on [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p_Q0a1kTBGzKElk_AH9n4JaDmPW9jlCB2HOsexuiVBA/edit?hl=en). Many thanks to knioette for putting these together. :)

**90days Round 2**

Now that our first 90 days together are over, we’re all pretty excited to move on to our next 90 days and we would love to see more people join us in our attempt to transform ourselves into fitter, healthier, happier people. If you aren’t sure how to get started, or if you struggle to maintain your motivation, or if you work out and eat right but aren’t seeing any progress, hopefully joining this group will point you in the right direction, keep you on track, and help you to push through plateaus.

As we did in Round 1, we will be having Your Daily Goal (YDG) posts for everyone to check in with their daily goals, progress, setbacks, or whatever else they feel like talking about. In the beginning, these will most likely be filled with questions and suggestions, and hopefully they’ll be very informative for us all. As we get closer to the end of the 90 days, the YDG posts will start turn in to “More of the same today, still keeping on track” as most of us will be settled into our routines by then, making small changes here and there. Toward the end, it feels kind of weird to post something that essentially says you have nothing to say, but I think these posts were helpful to me. They kept me on track and in the habit of posting and checking in, which helped me to develop my eating and exercise habits. Please don’t ever feel like your daily check-in is insignificant. It’s encouraging to know that other people are still here, chugging along toward their goals just like I’m trying to do.

**Something New in Round 2**

The original r/90days included daily posts to help us skip over the diet and workout clutter to find the information that really matters. There were several posts and comments after the r/90days crash that indicated that people *want* to make changes, and they were very excited to have someone show them how to do it, but without a person to show them the way, they weren’t sure how to get started. To be clear, this isn’t the same as r/90days was. We don’t have a single leader guiding us to our new lives this time. For Round 1, we each followed different routines and had very different diets.

However, for this round, I’m going to make it one of my daily goals to post reading materials every morning to get us started on our 90 day transformations. Since I am by no means an expert on nutrition or fitness, these will mostly be *summaries* of Tom Venuto’s [The Body Fat Solution](http://www.thebodyfatsolution.com/) and/or [Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle](http://www.burnthefat.com/) (BFFM). I highly recommend reading either or both of these books. I listened to the Body Fat Solution while doing C25K in Round 1, and it was an extraordinary book. For Round 2, I’ll be working my way through BFFM, hopefully about a chapter or two a week. I hope that these daily reading materials will stir up a nice discussion and help us to make reasonable goals and healthy diet and exercise choices. If you aren’t sure where to start for picking out good meal plans or exercise routines, then hopefully these posts and discussions will help you find something that’s right for you. If nothing seems like a good fit, then feel free to ask for advice in these posts or in a new thread.

I know that a lot of people already have their own diets and exercise routines picked out. By all  means, continue doing what’s already working for you. The structured part will be for those who *want* structure. I ask that everyone (especially our more advanced fitness guys) please add to the daily reading posts with any information that might be helpful.

Another thing that will be kind of new this time will be weekly check-in posts. In Round 1, we had weekly status reports (sometimes) where we would summarize our progress to date. For this round, I will be posting a spreadsheet on the sidebar where we can each update our weight and body fat percentage every Monday. On Monday mornings, I will put up a status update post to remind us to fill in our stats. These posts will also be a great place for us to ask more questions or post our frustrations or breakthroughs.

**Final Note**

Please, please, check with your doctor before you start changing your diet or adding on exercise. When you start adding exercises, start off slow and do things safely. The last thing any of us want is to see anyone get injured. There’s no rush here, this is a slow and steady climb to your goals. All you have to do is take it one step at a time, and keep an eye on your progress as you go. The results will follow.",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,self1,True,t3_e5xit,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/e5xit/90dg_day_0_welcome_to_r90daysgoal/,

SO!  Today is Monday.  A fresh week.  If you were dragging your feet last week, today is the perfect day to get in gear.  And for those of us who are in the midst of our goals, we need to continue and keep the momentum.  

After work, Im going for a run instead of taking a beloved nap.  I might go to the gym this time because I think I want to get on a stationary bike as well.  I need to introduce myself to different exercise techniques.  Not sure on dinner yet but Im leaning towards tilapia, salad and brown rice.  We shall see!

Welcome back for Round 11, Fitocrats! Whether you're a Fitocracy veteran or a new user - Group Challenges are back and we're hoping you'll join us for the first sprint, as well as the rest of the round! 
------------------------------

**Q. What is Fitocracy?**

A. Fitocracy is a social site where you sign up and track your workouts. You 'level up' by completing workouts, quests, and challenges. These range from something fairly simple (Go for a jog of any length, perform a bench press) to the ridiculous (Squat twice your bodyweight for 20 reps, Run a 4 minute mile). 

**Q. Ok, got it! Now what are groups?**

A. Groups/Challenges are a way to get people together with similar interests, and compete against one another in specific activities. For example, the Running Distance challenge only keeps track of how much you've run, and ranks you against other group members. You're still allowed to log whatever you want daily, but only running will count.

**Q. You've got me excited - now how do I *WIN*?**

A. The primary intent of these challenges is to encourage everyone to be more active, but many of us enjoy the competition and you should take great pride in finishing high in (or even winning!) a specific challenge. The way the challenges are ranked is strictly by points. When you complete an activity, fitocracy will hand you out a certain amount of points. You get more points for 'harder' activities. Running 5 miles at a 8 minute pace will get you more points than a 10 minute pace, and running 10 miles will get you more points than running 5.

**Q. When does the first set of challenges start?**

A. Unlike past rounds where we delayed challenges a week, we're now lining up the first set of challenges exactly with our sprints. The first challenge will run for the entire length of Sprint 1.

Goals are simply a manifestation of the underlying questions are the root of humanity. Why am I here? What do I want? How do I want to live my life? We are all seeking answers to these fundamental questions. Goal setting is just a means of answering these questions. 

Whenever I think about goal setting, I usually start by thinking about my life in different ways. Everyone has different parts to their lives, with some parts staying distinct and some blending together. My life can be broken down into the following general divisions, ordered in what I consider to be important: 

* Physical - my physical health is my #1 priority. 
* Family - relationships with my wife, kid, immediate family and close friends
* Financial - financial stability, both near term and long term
* Professional - winning the rat race
* Projects - development projects in things I find interesting that have potential
* Hobbies - golf

So sit down and think about how your life breaks down. Students might only have three divisions: health, family and school. You might have more divisions than me. It doesn't matter how you break it down. Once you have your divisions, start thinking about the things that you like about those divisions of your life and what you would like to improve. Here’s a simple example of some of the things I want. 

* Physical - maintain a healthy weight, stay fit cardiovascularly, look good, be in the best shape of my life on my 40th birthday.
* Family - spend quality time with my wife, do plenty of family activities, make sure to talk with my friends regularly and schedule time to spend with them. 
* Financial - pay off all my debts, fully fund all retirement, maintain insurance for loved ones.
* Professional - make partner
* Projects - work on professional blog, create speaking engagements to conferences for technology
* Hobbies - shoot in the 70s.

Take some time. Write them down. Leave them alone for a day or so and come back to them. Once these generalized desires are documented, then you can begin to get what you want. 

So your first step is to think about the questions again in the context of the divisions of your life.

Reddit has a huge student community, and that is certainly also the case on /r/90daysgoal. Student life poses a few particularly difficult challenges to weight loss and fitness, which is why we've created this group. Our hope is that this can be a place where students at all levels can share ideas for improving their lives: 

* on a student budget. 
* in the midst of exam insanity. 
* while visiting home or on break from school. 
* despite weekly parties. 
* when you only have access to cafeteria food. 

I have a number of ideas for weekly topics to discuss, but I'd like to hear from everyone about what they'd like to see in this group. So let's hear from you! What level of school are you in? When do you (did you?) start school? What challenges do you foresee in the next few months? What are your goals?

I'm structuring this progress post similarly to my intro post.

This was my second round.  It feels really great to have completed TWO whole rounds, mostly because I'm really proud and pleasantly surprised with the progress I made, and the prospect of actually reaching my overall goals is both exciting and less and less intimidating!

**Round 6 Starting Stats:**

* Age 30
* Female
* Height: 5'6""
* Starting weight (this round): 194 lbs (Note: in Round 5 I went from 223-195, and had a peak non-pregnancy weight of 228 lbs., which I use as my overall ""high"" number)


**Goal vs. End of Round 6 Stats:**


* 90 days Weight Loss -  **Goal:** 24 lbs., **Actual:** 16.2 lbs., *(under goal by 7.8 lbs.)*
* Weekly Weight Loss Average -  **Goal:**  1.5-2 lbs, **Actual:** 1.26 lbs, *(under goal by 0.24 lbs.)*
* Weekly Exercise - **Goal:**  Cardio (Running) 3 times/week, Strength Training 1 time/week, **Actual:** Cardio (Running) 3-4 times/week, Strength Training 1 time/2 weeks, *(Over cardio goal by 1x/week, under strength training by 1x/week)*

**My Thoughts on This Round of 90 Days Goal**

So, as you can see, I met some of my goals, but not all.  When I participated in Round 5, I met all of my goals, so I definitely had to battle some disappointment and a lot of psychological road blocks this round.  

I don't know...it seemed like this last fall and during my first 3 months of real dieting the weight came off pretty easily, but once January hit (and into early February), I honestly felt like I was plateauing really hard and really struggled keeping my spirits up about my progress.  I just want to be open about that because now that more time has passed it would be easy to put on rose colored glasses and just focus on the outcome, but I do want others to know that I really struggled at times this round.

On to the results...well, after just over 50 lbs. of total weight loss, and considering I'm getting closer and closer to my goal weight, I'm really starting to feel like a different person.  I'm within 5 lbs of the thinnest I've been in over a decade, so that's pretty incredible.  I can wear normal/non-plus size clothes again, for the first time in probably 8 or 9 years.  I have been less self-conscious and finally enjoying shopping for (and wearing!) cute clothes again, although with about 20 lbs left to shed I'm very hesitant to buy too many new clothes right now.  First, it needs to be an incentive to continue losing weight, and also, I almost feel like if I bought too many clothes I'd get comfortable and not continue to drop more lbs.  

Anyway, even though I ""only"" lost about 16 lbs this round, it's really gotten to a point where people all around me are noticing and complimenting me, so that really feels great.  I wrestle with telling people how much I've lost, because on the one hand, saying ""I've lost 50 lbs"" really quantifies the hard work, but on the other, it makes me cringe to acknowledge I was carrying around that much extra weight on my frame.  I'm not proud of the fact that I was fat for so long, but I guess at least I can try and disengage from that and be happy with where I am now.

After (what felt like) stagnating through most of January and February (despite still counting calories and working out on schedule), I felt like I needed to revamp things, and so I changed one key bit of my mindset.  Instead of focusing on ""I don't want to be fat anymore"" (i.e. counting lbs lost), I started focusing on what I DID want to be (i.e. counting down to my goal weight).  I guess once I got closer to my goals I needed to re-envision what I wanted to ""end"" to look like.  

I also really started taking better care of myself, partially because now I didn't feel as silly for doing it.  There is something inherently ironic to me about larger people who put a lot of attention to detail into their appearance, because unfortunately it really communicates to others that you're kind of missing the point with your own self-care.  Now that I don't feel so blatantly overweight, I don't feel as...hypocritical, perhaps?...about taking care of those details.

Lastly...pretty thrilled to report I went from being obese (yikes!) to overweight for my BMI.  Whether or not I'll be considered healthy at my goal weight for my BMI is another matter, but I do plan on getting a full physical and some specific measurements taken at that time to better gauge my health.

Ooooh, and one final thing.  I got a [Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com)  for my anniverary present and it has totally rocked my world!!!  So much of your dieting, if you're a calorie counter like me, is based on numbers, and the FitBit provides them in spades.  Of most help has been the total daily calories burned measurement, and the most fascinating has been the sleep tracker.  I highly recommend it if you're a serious numbers dieter like me.

**About My Diet and Philosophy**

I use [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/karebearwsu) for calorie tracking (feel free to add me, my user name is karebearwsu), as well as [www.running-log.com](http://www.running-log.com/calendar?athleteid=17458), as well as [RunKeeper](http://runkeeper.com/user/karebearwsu/profile) to track my runs. 

I have been going for runs on my treadmill 2-4 days per week (muscle soreness and time permitting). I usually go for a total of about 45-75 minutes, alternating the goal of each workout on improving either my time, distance, or speed.  On days I work out, I usually eat back most of my calories.  I know not everyone does this, but I find the non-workout days I find to be much more challenging, so this helps me stay sane.

I lost a significant amount of weight about 8 years ago (around 35 lbs), but have gained it back and thensome during that time (also had my first kid as well which contributed to weight gain).  I am currently down just over 50 lbs. since my heaviest non-pregnant weight in July of this year, and 45 since I began officially dieting again in mid-September.

I'm a firm believer in moderation and not doing anything so drastic as to not be sustainable.  My biggest challenges are juggling my other responsibilities (full-time student, stay-at-home mom, part time work from home) during the trim down phase (although my stress level during this round will likely be lower due to decreased commitments...yay!), and then developing long-lasting healthy eating habits in maintenance.  I tend to struggle more with portion sizes than food choices.

These can be great when you can't make it to a studio(on vacation?) but you don't have to be a dancer to do these. Its good to know the basic positions but she goes through them. Ballet builds long and lean muscle with no bulk and focuses a lot on lengthening and stretching, much like Pilates.

If you are completely new to ballet, haven't worked out in a while or you are completely inflexible do not, I repeat DO NOT try these in one go. It hurts. A lot. I've made it to about 8 without dying.  Also sometimes its a bit awkward when you have to change videos while your lying down or something, I recommend making a playlist.

I am DEAD this morning.  I woke up at 5a to get to my 6am Crossfit Foundations classes.  Suffice to say I am so outta shape.  I was last in everything.  I threw up when I left.  BUT Im excited!  Im just looking forward to being *strong*, you know?  Im looking forward to being able to do a damn pull up without struggling.  So here is to being a tough cookie!

Today's topic is: **Diets**.  &amp;I am stealing from #4's intro post:

We have people following all kinds of diets here, so I'll try to keep this reasonably general. Here are a couple things that I've picked up over the last few rounds:

* Don't diet, change your eating habits. Figure out your weaknesses and try to tackle those this round. Do you eat a whole bag of candy before you realize it's gone? Do you have big weekend binges after a week of healthy eating? Does drinking make you eat more? Do you tend to eat late at night? Do you eat when you're bored/stressed/alone/with friends? Do salty snacks make you crave more salty things? Do sugary snacks make you crave more sugary things? Figure out your triggers and try to recognize your old habits before you fall into them.

* Listen to your body. Lots of people end up eating too little when they're trying to lose weight. If you're feeling drained or moody, it might be because you aren't giving your body enough fuel. That doesn't mean you should blindly start eating more though. No matter what diet you're following, I think it's useful for everyone to calculate their BMR and target calories for the weight loss rate they'd like to reach. (There's more info about this [here](http://90daysgoal.com/getting-started/food-and-diet) &amp; [here](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/).)Then, without changing your diet, try tracking everything that you eat, every day, for a week or so. MyFitnessPal, LiveStrong, LoseIt, or other similar sites should be pretty useful here. How close do you get to your target calories? If you're way below, add in some fruits and veggies and other small snacks to round out your day. If you're way over, maybe look for some alternatives to some of the biggest contributors.

* Don't deprive yourself, strive for moderation. Swearing off french fries or ice cream for the rest of your life is... mind boggling. I don't think I could do it. Eating enormous portions of fries and ice cream on a splurge day because you haven't had them in forever isn't a great idea either though. Work toward a middle road. Maybe allow yourself a small splurge once a month. Try to stick to a single serving and really savor it.

* You can lose weight and still drink alcohol. You'll have to be pretty good about it. Make some food compromises, watch what you're eating the rest of the day, aim for moderation, and savor every sip. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on alcohol might be an easy way to push through it.

* You can lose weight and still eat bread/pasta/potatoes/rice/sweets. Again, you'll just have to be good about it. Small servings of starchy/carby foods aren't going to derail your progress. But if your day consists of a bagel, a sandwich with potato chips, and pasta with a baked potato and a piece of pie, you might want to consider scaling back on the carbs and adding a lot of fruits and veggies. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on carbs might be an easy way to push through it.

* A specific diet might work for lots of people, but that doesn't mean it will work for you. Try it out, see how you feel, see how your weight responds, gauge how hard it will be for you to keep it up long-term. If it doesn't seem to be working for you, try to figure out which part seems to be the problem.

* The end goal is a long-term, sustainable change to our eating habits. Quick weight loss has a pretty high relapse rate. If you're nearing your long-term weight goals, start setting out a maintenance plan for yourself. Don't let yourself slip back into old bad habits. Keep an eye on your weight. Set an alarm weight for yourself, probably 5-10 lbs above your long-term goal weight. If you ever go above that weight, it's time to re-examine your eating habits and make sure you're still following your maintenance plan.

* That being said, I would like to briefly touch on the topic of: *Eating Disorders*.  This was discussed in another post, but I feel that it bears repeating.  As a survivor &amp; struggler of an ED, I know first hand how difficult it is to transition into healthy eating habits.  What all of us want for you, as a a member of 90daysgoal, is to find your niche, to eat healthy.  I know that eating can cause anxiety and stress--especially when doing something new.  I urge to stray away from dangerous dieting (such as a extremely low caloritic intake diets) that could become counter productive to your health and well-being.  As it says in the first bullet, try and figure out your triggers &amp; stay away from behavior that could spiral you back into old habits.  Please know that we are always here if you need a sounding board.  BUT please also know that we cannot replace the expertise of a trained professional like a couselor or therapist.

With that in mind, let's talk about you!  What is your diet/eating habit plans for this round?  Do you have any questions about any diet you are interested in?  Do you have any questions about a diet you are already following?  

Personally, I am doing Paleo (80/20) and have been since November.  I lost over 10lbs in a little over a month.  It can be a little tough at times but as time goes along, it gets easier.  I think what has kept me in this diet longer than any other is that I've done my research.  &amp;I encourage you to do the same.

Now...!  Do you have any general dieting tips that you've picked up during your journey? Anything you've read or learned the hard way?

And lastly, how did you do yesterday?  Did you meet your goals?  What do you have on your agenda for the day?  It's Day 2, people!  Let's keep the momentum alive!

1317305286.0,16,self.90daysgoal,kva0z,[COLLEGIATE] Bi-Weekly post #1,17,1,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/kva0z/collegiate_biweekly_post_1/,"Hello, collegiate team! I want to thank each and every one of you for joining this round of 90 days! This is my first time around, so many of you may have more experience than I do, but I'm hoping that I can help impart some wisdom on and motivate all of you to achieve your fitness and health-related goals!

A little bit about me first:

* 21 years old
* Senior criminal justice major
* 6' 2""
* 246 lbs.
* Runner in the making

I've always been overweight, but I've made a lot of better decisions in the past few months as to how to manage my weight and level of fitness, so I'm using this 90 days to keep myself on track and to stay motivated. I'm hoping that all of us together can make our own individual goals happen though, especially because we are all in similar situations.

Let's get down to brass tacks: it's Thursday. Cool. Yeah. So what? Let me rephrase like my mostly-alcoholic roommates would say it: ""**IT'S THIRSTYYYYYYYY THURSDAYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!** Woo, yeah bro! Time to get your drink on! Yo wolfbaden6, come crack a brewski with us and play some beer pong!""

My roommates are stereotypical college bros. I'm unfortunately *very* aware of that. Regardless, my situation is far from rare. Every Thursday, college campuses across the nation witness a massive spike in alcohol consumption, poor decisions, and general debauchery. Between the coeds partying in hot and dark basements, the fraternities forcing every last drop of alcohol down their new pledges' throats, and the underage kids sneaking in a bottle of cheap vodka into their dorms, many students are drinking. There are a handful of exceptions who may have Friday exams, work, or do not like to drink, but the fact of the matter is that it is difficult to avoid alcohol on a Thursday in college.

What many people fail to consider when it comes drinking is just how detrimental it is to your health and your 90 days progress. I'm not going to teach you all about blacking out, cirrhosis of the liver, alcohol poisoning, etc. I'm not here to do that. I am here; however, to illuminate just how bad alcohol is for you. Let's look at some numbers:

Drink|||||||||||||||||||kCalories
-------------------------------
Keystone light----------103 per 12 oz

Coors light--------------104 per 12 oz

Miller light---------------96 per 12 oz

Natural light-------------95 per 12 oz

Smirnoff vodka-----------97 per 1.5 oz shot

Jagermeister-------------154 per 1.5 oz shot

Jack Daniels-------------122 per 1.5 oz shot

Clearly, I could go on for days, but these are the drinks that I've seen to be consumed most whenever I've gone to a college party. It's staggering though to look at the calorie count of some of these drinks! A light beer at 95 calories? That doesn't sound too light. 154 calories for a shot of Jager? That's insane! Actually, no. I take that back. That *pales* in comparison to what might actually go in one night.

Let's take a look at what a typical thirsty Thursday may look like for a college student who likes to drink (using examples from the list I provided):

* 8 Natural Lights
* 1 Coors Light
* 2 shots of Jagermeister
* 1 Jack and Coke (1.5 oz Jack and 10 oz of Coca Cola)

::

* Natural Lights = 8 x 95
* Coors Light = 1 x 104
* Jagermeister = 2 x 154
* Jack and Coke = 122 + 121 (for the Coca Cola)

::

760 + 104 + 308 + 243

=

1415

1415 calories.

Let that sink in for a minute.

1415 calories in a night of drinking.

That does not even include the pizza, burger and fries, cheese steak, gyro, or whatever food many students like to get when they're trying to sober up a little.

One night of drinking may almost be or exceed the recommended daily caloric intake for an adult.

I'm not telling you to not go out and drink; I'm not your RA, I'm not your parents. I'm just hoping you'll make smart decisions when it comes to your health and sometimes numbers really open up your eyes. Don't sabotage a week of healthy dieting and exercise just so you can spend your whole weekend hammered and stumbling on the streets, but don't sit inside your room for a whole semester wishing you had gone out to that one party or that you went to the bar with your friends.

I'm looking to ultimately reach a solid 250lbs but I realize that takes time. I just moved to San Francisco and the food is amazing but the honeymoon is over and harsh reality has set in. Also when I moved I stopped playing tennis. I LOVE playing and it pains me to see my racquets gather dust. This first 90 days, I am looking to make a lifestyle change and really focus on the way that I eat and to get back into tennis. I have done weight watchers in the past and it worked out pretty good, (I lost 25lbs) and recently I was below 300... I am looking for motivation and brotherhood.

So on Monday we asked you to introduce yourselves and say who you are.  Today I'd like to discuss why you're here, as in your **Motivation.**

You may have mentioned your motivation in your introductions, but tell us again.  Are you here to lose weight?  Is this your first time, or have you tried and failed and need some support?  Are you trying to lose weight for something specific, wedding, vacation, etc?  Do you want more energy to play with the kids?  Want to look better naked (this is everyone's I think).  Knowing why you're here can help us figure out how we can help you.

My motivation when I joined was to lose weight, and I found this community immensely supportive.  So much so that I kept with it even after hitting my goal weight and running 2 half-marathons!  My motivation now is to be in the best shape possible when I run my full marathon in October right after this round ends.  Lately I have fallen into bad eating habits, which had been affecting my runs.  In order to properly train to run 26 miles, I need to not have bad training runs, or be overweight. 

So that's why I'm here, to get back on track.  What's your motivation for joining us here?  I hope everyone has a great Wednesday!",[WLW],False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,WLW,self5,True,t3_1ihah4,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1ihah4/women_losing_weight_july_17th/,

Hell it's a life changing transformation I am embarking on, it's very exciting and new to me! Being proud of what I have accomplished I post fitness related things on my Facebook and Twitter feed from time to time, sometimes progress photos sometimes just exclaiming how I deadlifted X amount. 

Since I have started doing this I have had people comment on these statuses telling me to stop posting things like this, I have even had friends approach me offline and tell me to stop doing it as people don't want to see things like that on their News Feed. I used the hashtag #GetSkipFit on Twitter (I post there a lot more than I do on Facebook) and I know people can mute the hashtag and my posts if they want to. I just want to know why people, who are supposed to be my friends, hate seeing me trying to better myself? 

People don't seem to mind posts like ""omg I drank so much vodka last night I am dying today lol"" yet I post about how hard that 5 mile run was and people lose their shit. I understand constant posts about anything can get irritating to see but I post maybe one fitness related post a week.

The only conclusion I come to each time I think about this is people hate being reminded that they are sat on their arses doing nothing and seeing you out there putting in VERY hard work to make yourself look better intimidates them and makes them feel bad.

sorry about this ranty post I am just sick of people telling me to stop posting things that I am very proud of.

EDIT: I've decided to stop posting on Facebook and keep all my fitness posts for places like this, I may even just start a blog. I was very open about my thoughts on this ended up being labelled 'a douche' by a few friends on Facebook. It's really not worth people hating me or falling out with me, plus I am really beginning to hate that site haha",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,1372179836.0,,self9,True,t3_1h19wg,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1h19wg/why_do_people_hate_when_you_try_and_better/,

So on Day 1 Monday we all introduced ourselves and said who we were.  Now I want to know why you're here.  As in **What's your Motivation?**  Your motivation to be here, to be healthy, or to accomplish whatever goals it is that you set for yourself.

Why do you want to be healthier? -- Do you want to be healthy for your family?  Do you want to lose weight for upcoming bikini season? (Don't we all?)  Do you want to gain strength to be able to complete Tough Mudder?  

Why do you want to be here? -- Have you tried to lose weight on your own and failed without a support system?  Do the real people in your life not support you?  Do you just like talking about fitness/running/yourself with other people online? 

***

Just to start things off, or to give you an example, I fell into this group over a year ago.  I had lost weight before and gained some of it back after a bad breakup and a move to a new place.  So my motivation was to lose the weight I had gained so my clothes fit again.  Seriously - I bought 2 pairs of stretchy work-type pants and wore them all the time because I wouldn't admit that I had grown out of all my old clothes.  

After losing 40 pounds over 2 rounds, my motivation for running is to continuously push myself to do better.  I love running a new personal record, either for time or distance.  I love pushing myself past where I thought I could go, because I think it makes me mentally tough.  My motivation for being here is to keep up that energy and to talk about my issues with a like-minded community.

Sorry if you are absolutely sick and tired of introducing yourself, but I tried to make this intro a little more running-specific rather than general - feel free to link to your post in the intro thread if it has any relevant info!

* How did you get into running?  How long have you been running?
* Do you have a running goal for Round 10 as a whole, and any for specifically Sprint 1?  What is it?
* Do you have a specific training plan you are going to follow?

* Do you have any upcoming races and any goal times?
* Any cool running accomplishments that you’d like to share?  It doesn’t have to be about races, it can just be anything you feel like was a big deal to you with running!
* Do you have any ideas for future running thread topics that you would like to see?
* Anything else you’d like to tell us about yourself, running-related or not?

I'll post my answers in the comments!  Your turn - **tell us about yourself!**  If you have any questions, comments, concerns, suggestions, input on anyone’s training plans, or whatever, feel free to comment on each other’s posts - any way we can help each other out in achieving our goals is awesome :D

It happened. I got over it. I moved on. I recognized it for what it was unfortunately it happened towards the end of the round and there wasn't any way to undo the damage. Oh...I'm good at this... :-)

Things I have learned...even a little bit of exercise helps to combat stress...this was my toughest semester (yet) but I didn't freak out on my family like I normally do...I wasn't consistent on the exercise...thank you injuries...but I did realize I enjoy running and am looking forward to being able to start C25K again...what else did I learn...OH!

I thought at the beginning of the round I was doing great with my eating and I was until real life stepped in and kicked my butt. Then life was stressful and my food intake went to crap. I'm working on getting out of the food crap downward spiral. 

I think I learned other things but I can't remember them right now. Oh...I am thankful for this subreddit.This was my first round.

So where do we start, weight I guess. I began with 84 kilos wanted to maybe breach under 80 again (77 would be more than nice), went down to 82 and after Easter back to 84. Eating also, I have a habit of eating too much I like, also emotional (feel good) eating. On the other hand, it is not that I was not having success this round. I had a new personal record for bench pressing and shoulder press. And my running time is, for me, lightning fast. I was injured before and started c25k again. My personal best in September was 26:33 (for 5200 m), right now I would consider it a slow time. Personal best now is 24:38. Since February 21th I did not run slower than my personal best back then, which is amazing to me. I beat my running time record 4 times this round.

The Fitocracy challenges tell me that I wasn't that bad compared to the others, too. First in Triathlon (though not much participation here), 2nd in the chin-up/pull-up (724 of these) challenge, 3rd in the push-up (4835 push-ups) and boot camp challenge, 5th when it comes to running distance (171.5 km), 6th for bench press (76 kg), 9th for deadlift (110 kg) and overall 9th which is, looking at the competition pretty good. What I learned from participation here and constant chest pain, sometimes Fitocracy does not help me. I optimized my workout to gain points, but will change it (as you need rest) to optimize my training results. So no more overtraining for me (and less Fito-points in the future).

I always saw 90dg as a way to improve myself and besides my back problems I was mostly here to improve my body imagine. With different results. And while I lost my overweight, stopped chewing nails, bought fancy clothes, have now a stylist with a name and do this and that to feel better about myself, I do not really feel that good about myself. Quite confusing actually if you think about it, because honestly I am sure I am now looking better than ever. This is something I do have to work on, for this round (7) particular to go out of my shell and meet people, be more social, and surely to improve the communication with my wife. The situation at home is, interesting, as I have a lively daughter and an exhausted wife. She is due at the end of August and we are expecting a boy. And I certainly need to figure out my emotions and well like I said, get out of my shell. It is getting redundant here. Having high hopes for the next round.

This was a great reset of my life in many ways.  Thank you for this subgroup.  

I ate paleo / low carb.  Avoided eating grains except for beer, avoided dairy and stomach issues nearly vanished.  I felt so good avoiding grains and eating a la Paleo / Caveman.  It was also such a relief to regain some of my health back in those regards.  Physically, Emotionally, and Mentally I felt so much better.  I got off my meds due to my change in diet, and resulted in greater self image and self confidence.

I lost weight, and started to jog which was awesome.  C25K works and works great.  I started it over to develop better running habits and to increase speed.  24 pounds were lost, and beyond that, my overall sense of self has improved.  

I fell off track a few times, but that was ok, 90 days is a great way to build upon lifestyle changes.  Now that weather is warming up, I will be outside more often, more active, and feeling more confident.

The next 90 days will incorporate original goals, plus new ones pertaining to overall quality of life.  Will incorporate more Primal Fitness, and with gardening coming up, will be eating more local fresh food!

Can't believe it's the end of round six already :D

This was my first round and I wanted to lose 20lbs and feel better about myself and maybe learn to run...

I managed to do all of that! I feel awesome, here's how I did it.

* DIET: I stopped eating like shit. I don't drink any soda or fizzy drinks or any fake juice. I largely stopped eating processed foods - basically if it's in a box, needs to be microwaved, has ingredients in it I can't understand then I don't eat it. I replaced those kinds of food with vegetables and fruit and it's actually incredibly easy to do that! You just have to get inventive and google recipes. It doesn't even take any longer to cook and despite what a lot of people think my shopping bills are still crazy-student-low (maybe like... £30 a week MAX) 

* EXERCISE: I took up jogging/walking in the beginning, following a C25K type plan of walking a bit and jogging a bit until finally I was just able to run for longer and longer periods of time. I also started getting more active generally - just got off my ass and made the switch to being an active person by telling myself (this sounds ridiculous but I did it) 'I am an active person' 'I am a athletic person' every day until it started to come to true :) 

* Life: I was unhappy, I fixed it. Moved house, surrounded myself with people I like, worked harder at Uni and spent time doing things I enjoy. This all made me happier. I also quit smoking because it didn't make me happy I was just addicted - it fucking sucked at first but now I have no interest in it. 

STATS: Before is in the brackets: 


*Weight: [166.6] 140.4 (26.2lb loss!) 

*Waist: [29.8inches] 26.5, (3.3 inch loss!)

*Hips: [39.5] 38, (1.5 inch loss!)

*Boobs: [36.6] 34, (2.6 inch loss!)

*Arms: [13] 11, (2 inch loss!)

*Thigh: [23] 21.5. (1.5 loss!)

*Total inch loss: 10.9 (irrelevant statistic but none the less! Yaay!)
 
Apologies if any of those are wrong, I did my best tired calculations.

Basic message here is if you are thinking about making the change, DO IT! I was very lazy and very inactive and completely miserable about that. I just made small changes each day and I have never felt happier or healthier - I still have 11lbs to go and a lot of improvements to make on my endurance and strength but I know with a steady approach it can be done,

Thanks r/90daysgoal - I couldn't have done it without your support! 

EDIT: Also I would highly recommend MyFitnessPal or whatever charting tool you like - count every damn calorie you put in your mouth and be real with yourself about it and the weight will come off in no time. Also I didn't realise how much of a difference I have made this far until I started looking back at my stats from the beginning - it really motivates you to have a visible chart showing you that your work has paid off.

On [Day 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/o974v/dailygoal_day_1_january_9_2012/) you thought about your goals and really visualized them. Right? If you didn't do that yet, take a moment to do that now. Get personal with your reasons for being a part of Round 6. Go ahead. I'll wait. *waits patiently*

Got your goals in your mind? Are they up close and personal? Do you REALLY **WANT** to acheive them? Good. :)

Now I want to focus on the fact that there WILL be so very many things that will come up and entice you away from acheiving those goals. There will be SO many reasons and excuses that will come between you and the ONLY thing that will keep you working toward them will be your word. I would like to invite all of you to both give AND honor your word toward your commitments and goals this round. :) If you are ready to do that give your word to your commitments in the comments below!

**Want to know what it looks like when you honor your word and just do it if for NO OTHER REASON than because you said that you would?**

It looks like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SbXgQqbOoU). And [this](http://bodyforlife.com/success-stories/#pg-1). And [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics).

I'll let you in on a little secret: there is no magical motivation fairy that will sprinkle motivation dust on you while you sleep. Motivation isn't some woo-woo thing that is somewhere OUT there, out in the ether, something you just need to locate or acquire. Motivation exists WITHIN you and it begins when you honor your word even if for NO OTHER REASON than because you said that you would. :)

1325026285.0,14,self.90daysgoal,nstek,[PROGRESS] 17lbs down in 90 days... I'll take it. ,16,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/nstek/progress_17lbs_down_in_90_days_ill_take_it/,"This was my first round of 90 days. I started at 193lbs ended at 176lbs. I started losing weight at 220+ lbs in June, so I've lost over 45lbs altogether.

These 90days saw my through some ups and downs. I started out at a plateau that felt like it lasted forever and a half. This seemed to be a theme over the past 3 months. 

I also started weight lifting which I have now fallen in love with. I am going to start Stronglifts this week now that I have gotten over my paralyzingly fear of the co ed weight room and I'm no longer restricted to 5lb dumbbells in the ladies section.

For cardio my plan was originally to train for a 10k over these 90 days but I was getting a lot of pain and decided to maintain my 5k running as I had just completed C25k right before the 90 days started. I will probably start training for a 10k run in February as there is a big run in my city that I would like to do in April. I did however successfully maintain my 5k runs! 

As my plateaus lasted longer so did my urges to sabotage myself. So I turned to keto in an effort to break my carb addiction. I lasted for just over 2 weeks. I have been doing low carb instead (under 100grams). Although I understand keto is awesome for some, for me I felt like a zombie and it was quite difficult to maintain a calorie deficit. Furthermore my weight lifting and cardio was suffering. It was also too strict for me, I had a constant fear of ingesting hidden carbs anytime I went out and it was just too much stress to run a calorie deficit and keep my carbs under 20g. At least I tried it and I have been happy maintaining low carb. 

For now, I am taking a break from calorie counting over these holidays for 10 days. Ive been at it since June so I needed a break for my sanity. I am starting again on January 1st (how cliche). 

My goals for the next 90 days will be to continue with my weight lifting. Start training for a 10k in April and hopefully lose 1lb/week. Looking forward to joining everyone again for the next round!

I've been doing my own version of a couch to 5K on my treadmill (my knees are a bit iffy so I don't run on anything that's not flat).  I have logged 22 runs since I started out.  

About a week ago I was in a lot of shin pain after upping the speed of my run by only 0.1 mph, so I gave myself a week off to rest and tried again on Tuesday.

Upon reviewing my running logs, I realized that maybe a good strategy would be to slow down my pace by a decent amount and see if that made a difference in how my shins felt.  So, instead of my normal 5.8 mph pace, I decided to try it at 5.5 mph when I began my run yesterday.

My previous record was 2.5 miles without stopping (with an additional 1.0 miles after a rest).  Yesterday I covered the treadmill screen with a towel and ran until I just couldn't contain my curiosity.  By the time I looked how far I'd gone, I was already almost at 3 miles.  I immediately knew I'd be able to finish a 5K.  I was further surprised to hit the 3.3 mile mark and realize I still wasn't tired enough to stop, so I kept going until I had run a total of 4 miles in 43 minutes and 39 seconds.  I believe my time when I hit 3.3 miles was 36 minutes flat.  Not too shabby!  I am excited to have found a pace that doesn't hurt me and I can see myself continuing long term.  Yay!

Mr_Nox here.  We're 30 days into round 5, and I thought I'd post a progress report.

I'm not down any weight at all.  In fact, as of my last weigh in, I'm up a pound from the start of the round.  But the good news is that:

* I've lost .25 inches off my stomach and thigh
* I've lost .70 inches from my hips
* I've gained almost an inch on my biceps

My pants are looser since the start of the round, and I'm definitely stronger.

Today's topic is shin splints, which is one of the most common problems that seems to come up for new runners.

***

**What are shin splints?**

Shin splints are pains in your legs below the knee. The pain usually develops on the front outside part (anterior shin splints) or lower inside part of the leg (medial or posterior shin splints). (Illustrated [here](http://www.kennethsdivecenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/shin-splints-treatement.jpg).)

Shin pain can occur when you start a new walking or running routine, increase your distance or speed, start wearing new shoes, or make changes to your stride. The pain is caused by small tears in your leg muscles that develop because of a muscle imbalance in your legs. If you feel shin pain while running, slow down or walk the rest of the way. Treat your pain before you continue your running routine. Shin splints will go away over time as you build up your leg muscles, but running through the pain will not help.


***

**Preventing shin splints**

Before running
&gt; * **Shoe type:** [Make sure you're wearing the right type of running shoes for your foot type.](http://running.about.com/od/shoesapparelandgear/ht/runningshoe.htm) Get your shoes professionally fitted at a running shoe store. General sporting goods stores will not usually be able to give you much help when picking out your shoes. You may need special shoes to help with [overpronation or underpronation/supination](http://media.summitmedicalgroup.com/media/db/relayhealth-images/pronatio.jpg).
&gt; * **Shoe age:** Replace your running shoes every 250-400 miles.
&gt; * **Heel walking:** Before running, walk on your heels, with your toes pointed as high as you can. Keep your stride slow and short (6 inches or less) and walk for about 25 yards at a time. If pain increases, stop and stretch your shins. (Source: [ehow](http://www.ehow.com/list_7262222_warm_up-exercises-shin-splints.html))
&gt; * **Toe walking:** Before running, walk on your tip-toes, toes pointing straight forward, for about 25 yards. Next, rotate your legs from the hip and walk 25 yards on your tip-toes with your toes pointed outward. And finally, rotate your legs inward and walk 25 yards with your toes pointed inwards. For each of these, take short, controlled steps. (Source: [ehow](http://www.ehow.com/list_7262222_warm_up-exercises-shin-splints.html))
&gt; * **Warm up:** Walk or jog at an easy pace for 5-10 minutes before you increase your speed.
&gt; * **Stretch:** [Stretch your legs](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_1/126.shtml) after you warm up.

During your run
&gt; * **Proper stride:** Pay careful attention to your stride. Do not overstride. Your foot should land under your body, not out in front of you. ([Read more on running stride and form.](http://www.runningplanet.com/training/running-form.html)). For pain in the back of the leg, make sure you are not leaning too far forward when running.
&gt; * **Avoid hills:** Avoid running on uneven surfaces and very hilly routes. If you plan to run in a hilly area, introduce hills to your routine gradually.
&gt; * **Avoid hard surfaces:** Avoid running on hard surfaces, such as concrete. If possible, run on grassy or dirt trails
&gt; * **Increase intensity slowly:** Increase your distance and speed slowly, no more than around 10% per week.
&gt; * **Mix up your intensity:** Include a mix of high intensity and low intensity training, with at least 1-2 rest days each week, giving your legs time to heal between runs.
&gt; * **Leg warmers:** During your run, keep your calves warm with long socks or leg wraps.

After running
&gt; * **Stretch:** [Stretch your legs](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_1/126.shtml) again after you finish your run.
&gt; * **Rest:** Make sure you're giving yourself enough rest in between runs. Your muscles need time to build and repair.
&gt; * **Ice:** After running, stretch and ice your shins to decrease swelling.
&gt; * **Foam roll:** Foam rolling is great for working out tension in your muscles. For some suggested rolls for calves and shins, see [this site](http://www.realjock.com/article/1218).
&gt; * **Exercise:** On your rest days, do shin and calf exercises and stretches (see below).


***

**Exercises and stretches to prevent shin splints**

Shin stretches
&gt; * **Standing shin stretch:** Stand with your feet together. Place the top of one foot on the floor slightly behind you and drag your foot forward until you feel a stretch in your shins. Hold for 15-30 sec. Repeat for other foot. (Like [this](http://professionalmassagetherapist.org/images/stretchimages/image_134.jpg).) (Source: [Craddock](http://professionalmassagetherapist.org/stretches/stretches_Results.php))
&gt; * **Kneeling shin stretch:** Kneel on the floor with your toes pointed straight out behind you, like [this](http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/gallery/jenny/shin_stretch.jpg).) Lean back slowly until you feel a stretch in your shins. Hold for 15-30 sec. (Source: [sportsinjuryclinic.net](http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/cybertherapist/stretching/shin_stretch.php))

Calf stretches (should help with anterior shin splints)
&gt; * **Toes-out toe raises:** Stand with heels together, toes pointed out. Slowly raise up onto your toes, then lower yourself back down. Repeat 10 times. (Source: [active.com](http://www.active.com/running/Articles/Try_these_exercises_to_prevent_shin_splints.htm))
&gt; * **Toes-in toe raises:** Stand with big toes together, heels far apart. Slowly raise up onto your toes, then lower yourself back down. Repeat 10 times. (Source: [active.com](http://www.active.com/running/Articles/Try_these_exercises_to_prevent_shin_splints.htm))
&gt; * **Toe flexes:** Place your heels on the edge of a step, toes hanging off the edge. Raise your toes up slowly, flexing them toward your shins. Hold for 1 sec, then slowly release. Repeat 10 times. (Source: [about.com](http://walking.about.com/od/exercises/a/shintoeraise.htm))
&gt; * **Standing toe-up calf stretch:** Stand with one knee bent and the other foot held straight out in front of you. Leaning on your bent knee for support, flex your toes toward your shins on your straightened leg, like [this](http://professionalmassagetherapist.org/images/stretchimages/image_119.jpg). Hold the stretch for 15-30 sec. Repeat for the other leg. (Source: [Craddock](http://professionalmassagetherapist.org/stretches/stretches_Results.php))
&gt; * **Standing heel-balk calf stretch:** Stand with your legs split as if you were going to do a lunge. Keeping both feet planted on the floor, lean forward on to your front leg until you feel a stretch in your rear-leg calf, like [this](http://professionalmassagetherapist.org/images/stretchimages/image_122.jpg). Hold the stretch for 15-30 sec. Repeat for the other leg. (Source: [Craddock](http://professionalmassagetherapist.org/stretches/stretches_Results.php))

Achilles stretches (should help with medial shin splints)
&gt; * **Standing Achilles stretch:** Stand with one leg forward and crouch forward like [this](http://professionalmassagetherapist.org/images/stretchimages/image_131.jpg) until you feel a gentle stretch in your Achilles. Hold for 15-30 sec. Repeat for the other leg. (Source: [Craddock](http://professionalmassagetherapist.org/stretches/stretches_Results.php))
&gt; * **Kneeling Achilles stretch:** Kneel on the ground, with one foot placed in front of you, like [this](http://professionalmassagetherapist.org/images/stretchimages/image_132.jpg). Gently lean forward to stretch your Achilles. Hold for 15-30 sec. Repeat for the other leg. (Source: [Craddock](http://professionalmassagetherapist.org/stretches/stretches_Results.php))

Foam rolling
&gt; * **[Foam roll all the things](http://www.realjock.com/article/1218)**

***

**Treating shin splints**

If you have shin splints, it's time decrease your running intensity, decrease your running frequency, or completely stop running for a few days, . Your muscles need time to rest and recover. By continuing to run with shin splints, your muscles will not be able to repair themselves and the shin splints won't get better. During your recovery break, ice your shins for 10-20 min at a time and perform light stretches. Consider swimming or biking to continue conditioning your body without placing too much stress on your legs. If you continue to run at a lower intensity, avoid running on hills and hard surfaces. When your legs are feeling better, you can gradually reintroduce hills and hard trails into your routine.

**Round 5 Check-in Data**

As you check in throughout Round 5, you can look at your weight and bf% data [**here**](http://goo.gl/j2OVY). The spreadsheet is also stickied to the sidebar as ""R5 Check-in data"".

All names have been removed and are replaced with a code. The form of the code is [Gender]/[Age]/[Height in inches]_[Signup#]. The signup # is used to make sure everyone has a unique code. You probably won't know your signup # unless you are an amazing guesser, but hopefully most people will be able to figure out their code by looking at the weight or body fat percentage tabs. If there's more than one code that could be you, and you aren't sure which is yours, send me a PM and I'll send you your code. The codes will be the same throughout the round, so once you know it, it should be easier to find your data.

***

**Notes about the spreadsheet:**

Check-ins tab
* Shows you the total number of times you checked in for a week
* An entry of ""0"" means there was an error with your check-in

Weight (lbs) and Weight (kg) tabs
* Shows your weight each week
* If you checked in more than once, your average weight is shown

BF%
* Shows your BF% each week
* If you checked in more than once, the sum of your percentages is shown (to avoid a large number of div/0 errors)
* If you left your body fat percentage blank, it shows up here as 0

Other stuff
* If you can't find your code, you might be one of the #N/A's at the bottom. #N/A means either you didn't fill out the [sign up form for round 5](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFRfR0RTZUx4eUtkSWoxalNGOUxsWUE6MA#gid=10) or there was a typo in your name. 
* If you see a typo in any of your data, please PM me or message the mods
* If you see any formatting issues or bugs, please PM me or message the mods

**Important note:** This sheet will not update immediately. Give it some time to refresh after you submit a check-in form. If you don't info doesn't update, send me a PM or message the moderators before you submit your form again.

I started about two months ago at 211 and I'm currently 190. I'm 5'4 so I'd ideally like to get down to 120, long term. For this 90 day goal I'm shooting for 170 and increased strength/lower bf%.

I like to mix up my cardio by doing classes, running, and HIIT. I try to get to the gym at least 5 times a week. I do general calorie counting and while I am not doing Keto or Paleo, I do try to keep my carbs more limited than the RDA.


edit: the long term tests of my strength of will are how I react to stress in my life. I've managed to pull myself through one funk during this period of time without resorting to old habits.

This post is intended for people who have signed up under 'Couch to 5K' on the groups spreadsheet. If you have not joined a group for these 90 days and would like to be part of C25K go and pop your name in on the spreadsheet over [here!](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsOUFG-d9pcodFZWRHZIXzUwTEhsdnBKYXdzeHAtUWc&amp;hl=en_US#gid=3) So far there are 25! people in this group so there will definitely be a big source of motivation and inspiration!


So who am I? I'm a 22 year old from Australia. I begun my weightloss journey (I hate calling it that, but that is really what it is) in February and joined Round 3 of 90 Days Goal around the same time. Since then I have done all sorts of crazy things I would never have imagined myself doing. One of them being completing the C25K program. I'm now training for a 10k (eeek!). I put my name down to be the team leader for C25K for this round because I think the program is amazing and that people beginning running is even MORE amazing. That being said, I feel like we are all in this together, so I am less leader and more knowledgeable(ish) friend. 


As you will have read, groups are a new thing this round, so I feel like it is all a lot of 'feeling as we go'. I thought we could use this post as an opportunity to:

- introduce who you are

- let us know where you are up to in the C25k program 

- *let me know if there is anything I can do to help you as your 'leader'/knowledgeable(ish) friend*

I'm happy to do things like: sending out PMs at the start of the week seeing how you're all going, posting a weekly(?) C25K post so everyone can share how their week of running went, share stories from my C25K experience so you know you're not alone. These are just my ideas though, so please share yours!


I was going back through my journal logs on my C25K app this morning and reading the comments I made after some of the runs. I thought that they appropriately conveyed some of the main sentiments expressed when starting running and thought I would share a few of them with you. Just to let you know that when you struggle running for 1minute, 3 minutes, 5 minutes or 20 minutes, you are **not** alone. 


*Week 1 - Day 1* - ""Vomit. Sweat. Blisters""

*Week 2 - Day 3* - ""Felt like vomiting end of last run. Sore muscles all over""

*Week 7 - Day 1* - ""Horrible calf pain whole run. This sucks""


Or if you just ran the most kick-ass run EVER, you have the right to feel like an absolute hero. 

*Week 4 - Day 1* - ""Two five minute runs!!!!! Wowee!! The second five minute was HARD, but I got there""

*Week 5 - Day 3* - ""TWENTY TWO MINUTES OF RUNNING. No problems. Wow.""


Can't wait for the next 88 days of amazing accomplishments and incredible running skills!

My New Years resolutions were to get healthy in 2011, physically and fiscally, and both goals are moving along well.

I hope to lose another 20lbs by June 3rd, when my friends and I are going on a tubing trip, and I'll need to fit my body into some contraption labeled ""bathing suit.""  The next goal is another 20lbs by August, which is when my and my sister's birthdays are, and we're going to the beach.


[Diet]
I'm lucky because I'm very strong willed.  I started a [Meal Plan](http://kthanx.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Meal-plan-1024x405.jpg) in January, and have been eating the same diverse foods for the last three months.  My boyfriend is starting to get bored of the food, so I'll be mixing it up soon, but still making it healthy and diet-friendly.  I haven't had any issues with temptation, and when we go out for happy hour or something, I DD, so I don't tack on added alcohol or snack calories (bar food FTL).  I'll have a few drinks a week, but I have a large calorie deficit due to my work outs, so one or even two beers in one day doesn't ruin me.

Also, we have a ""cheat"" meal once a week, when we can go to a restaurant and eat at will.  Interestingly enough, I can't eat as MUCH as I used to (yay portion control!), and I choose healthier options than my boyfriend does, but they are definitely still ""cheats"" on my diet.  I feel these cheat meals are important, so I don't get ""fed up"" with ONLY diet food and go off and eat something awful, then regret it later.  


[Exercise]
I go to the gym every morning and do the Elliptical.  I've played with length of time, resistance, and speed, and still feel a burn when I leave every morning.  I've noticed the back of my legs are looking nice and smooth, as opposed to the dimples they used to have... so yay for that.  

I do P90X 5 - 6 days a week (I often skip yoga because I hate it, and it doesn't burn a ton of calories).  I feel great after both of my workouts, and and I always have a protein shake or a snack with a lot of protein in it to help my muscles after a workout.


[LoseIt](http://loseit.com) has been a GREAT help in tracking my diet and exercise, and my FitIt buddy gives me someone to talk to about all the little details about getting fit that no one in RL cares about.  Of course, who can forget  r/90daysgoal?  This sub, and r/fitness have been helpful in keeping my motivated and THINKING THIN.  Thanks, y'all.

Fill in as much info as you can. If you track your weekly calories and exercise, include everything between Monday, Mar 07 and Sunday, Mar 13.

If your weight or body composition has changed, remember to update your calorie goals. This is also a good time to take progress pictures if it's been a couple weeks since your last set.

Please remember: Weight is noisy and can be discouraging. It might be up, it might be down. The number itself doesn't matter as much as your devotion to your new routines and habits. If you're picking up healthy habits, the changes will come over time. So check in, keep working toward your goals, and keep posting in the daily goal threads!

Feel free to post here about any progress, setbacks, breakthroughs, or questions that you've had over the past week! Good luck with your goals this week! :)

**edit:** Hmm, something's up with the check in sheet. If you get a blank page or an error after you submit, please try again a little later. If you're still not able to submit, please let me know! Sorry for any inconvenience.

**edit 2:** Still lots of google docs issues (and reddit issues, argh). I'm not able to even load the check-in spreadsheet right now, so I don't know whose check-ins have gone through. I'll add an update later today and repost when all the issues are cleared up (hopefully no later than tomorrow morning).

**edit 3:** Good news and bad news. I can finally load the spreadsheet (good news!), but only 4 people have successfully checked in (bad news). The form still isn't working for me, so I'm assuming it's still down for everyone (more bad news).

I'm so pleased with the community involvement this time around. I feel like the energy started strong and has stayed that way thus far, with non-mod-generated threads asking questions, lots of people offering advice and encouragement, and a variety of new topics and new ways of thinking.

How is the community working out for you so far? We're approaching the third week, and some say it takes about 3 weeks for new habits to form and become habits rather than stuff you just do. Week 3 is also the time when participation begins to wane a little, as habits fail to be formed, some get discouraged, and enthusiasm for self-improvement may be supplanted by a new enthusiasm. What's working for you so far? Do you enjoy the Women Losing Weight posts? Are you competing with the Bodyweight Challenges or in a fierce battle with a friend on Fitocracy? Are you finding solidarity with the Runners, or do you most enjoy the Tasty Tuesday threads thus far? How's your journey toward battling anxiety, recovering from an injury, learning a new language, or working on your personal life? Do you find the Daily Goal daily threads a source of accountability and positive reinforcement?

During Taekwondo last night we were doing our thing and I decided if I had a moment in between some forms and hapkidos that I would do just 5 pushups each time I had a second. Not a ton but over an hour they add up. The neat thing was that when some of my peers saw me they started to join in. 

Its just a quick story to kind of share two things about fitness. First, 5 pushups really added up! I did about 60 by the time 12 rounds of Hapkidos and forms came around. I am not good at doing a lot of pushups but when you stick with it and use this method of continually doing small amounts throughout a session called ""Greasing the groove"" you can get quite a few done!

Second, what we do with fitness and weight loss for ourselves makes us a positive influence to others. While those other people in my class didnt need to do some extra pushups they decided it was a good idea because I was doing them. They respect me because of the hard work I put into the art. Because I made a choice to be fit and strong. 

We are all working on those choices to become fit, strong, lean, or a bulkasaurus rex. I just wanted to remind you all that it is a good thing for you, it makes you a positive influence to others, and you can definitely do it!

I hope you all have a wonderful day today and let us know what you are doing in the name of fitness today.

While practicing last night for TKD and the other week ago for climbing I got a chance to work with 2 different great people. We did some pretty serious training together and it was such an amazingly positive experience. We were motivating each other and critiquing and just really working on the skills at hand. 

I realized it wasnt so much the people themselves but their attitude towards the work that made the absolute difference. They are dedicated and motivated to work hard and especially not afraid of hard work or failure. Their attitude affected me and hopefully vice versa. 

So my question to you this morning is how is your attitude during your workouts? Do you keep a posititve hard working attitude all of the time? Do you think it might be worth taking a few minutes to meditate to bring your attitude around to have a more positive workout and experience? Also, if you work with other people are you being a positive influence on them. If I am going to spend my time working hard and working with others I never want that to be a negative experience. Smile, laugh, and have a good time. Its just a workout. 

Tell us what you are up to today? Anything fun in the name of fitness? I got some yoga and some rock climbing but nothing exciting. Let us know!

How was your first week here with 90 days goal?  I LOVE all of the discussion that was going on in last week’s intro post :D  Any good runs this past week - races, PRs and accomplishments, cool new routes?  

It is getting to be race season, and it seems like quite of few of our runners here are planning to participate in a race in the upcoming weeks... so  today’s topic is **races**.  Do you have any races coming up?  If so, did you follow a specific training plan for it, or one of your own?  

One of the biggest things involved in a race is **race day prep.** This is something that might be of interest to runners who haven’t ever done a race before and aren’t sure what to expect, so I’d love for those of you who have raced before to contribute to the discussion and talk about your experiences!

Do you have a routine for the days following up to the race?  Everyone is different, so we’d love to hear what you do in order to prepare for a race that *isn’t* actually running!  Again, if you’re a newer runner who hasn’t yet done any races, don’t fret - here are some things to think about prior to your first race.  Just keep in mind that some of these tips depend on personal preference, and hopefully these steps toward general preparedness make the morning of your first race or two go smoothly and be less stressful.  

**Before the Race**

* Know the course:  look up a course map online, at the very least.  Are you familiar with the area?  If it’s nearby, you might want to take a drive there to check out the parking situation... if there’s not much parking available, you might want to get there extra early on the morning of the race.  Depending on where the course is, you might be able to drive it ahead of time - for my 10 miler a few weeks ago, I wasn’t familiar with the area so I drove the course (and immediately wanted to back out because I didn’t realize it would be so hilly......).  If it’s a shorter race, like a 5K, you might be able to incorporate the route onto one of your training runs.  Regardless of whether you check out the map, drive it, or run it, making yourself a little familiar with the area ahead of time can definitely quell some of your race-day jitters
* Outfit:  Do you know what you’ll be wearing the day of the race?  Have you worn it before?  Race day is definitely not the best time to test out a new pair of shoes or shorts or shirt - you want to make sure that you’re comfortable and that you know you won’t have to worry about chafing or loose elastic on shorts.  
* Diet and Hydration:  The morning of a race is also not a time to eat something different than usual - nobody likes a bellyache mid-run, and *definitely* not mid-race.  If you usually run right when you wake up and don’t eat anything first, you might end up needing to eat something that morning depending on the timing of your race (i.e. if you plan to get there early and have a long drive), but if that will be the case then I would suggest you try out eating food before some training runs.  I usually go on an empty stomach, but before long runs (and races) I usually have a tablespoon or two of peanut butter about an hour beforehand.  Same with what you eat during the week leading up to the race (or at least the night before) - the idea is to make race day just like any other day, but faster ;)  Also, be sure to be hydrated, but this kind of goes for all the time.
* Bibs:  Consider where you’ll pin your bib when figuring out your outfit - make sure that you’ll be able to have it in the right area that they want you to so that it works properly.  Also bring safety pins for it just in case they run out or don’t have any... most huge races have packet pick-ups in advance and you’ll be able to either get safety pins there or find out if you need your own, but for smaller races where you pick up the packet/bib that morning, it’s better safe than sorry!

**During the Race**

* Fuel:  This likely won’t come into play until you do longer races, but if you are planning to use fuel during a long race, keep it consistent with what you ate during training.  Training runs are a good time to try out different kinds of fuel - flavors, brands, types... on race day you know you don’t want something that will make you want to hurl, so it’s best to stick with what works!
* Hydration:  Some races offer both sports drinks and water - try to grab whatever you usually drink during runs... again, trying out new stuff on race day is a recipe for disaster.
* Pace:  You might be tempted to start off faster than your goal pace - don’t!  The energy of the crowd and adrenaline you’ll experience will give you a boost, but it’s better to start at your goal pace that you know you can maintain since you can always pick it up as you get closer to the end.  
* **Race how you train**:  this is the main take-home point for this... the point of your training up until this point was to build the skills you need to get through the race, and everything - what you eat, drink, wear, pace, etc. - plays a role in your training runs and then comes into play on race day.  Trust your training - that’s what it’s there for!  

**After the Race**

* Bask in glory:  Races are amazing experiences - you push yourself more than you ever thought possible and the energy of everyone there is amazing.  It’s absolutely fantastic.  I would absolutely suggest signing up for a race to anyone who hasn’t done one before - it doesn’t have to be a long race, it can be any distance you want :D

Alrighty, let’s hear from you guys and get some discussion going... here are some **questions for the day:**

* Races coming up?  If so, are you following a certain training plan or trying to get a certain time?
*  If you have one, what is your usual race routine - the days before?  Morning of?  During and after?
* Any tips for those who don’t have much race experience?
* Greatest race experience (could be a PR, could be just a general fun time... whatever was your favorite thing that happened during a race!)

Happy running :D

It's Friday!  And that means almost the end of the first week!  So let's talk for a minute about **WEEKENDS**.  For a lot of people weekends are a hard time to stay on track.  So what's your plan for weekends?  Will you use them as off/cheat time?  Or will you keep to your same weekly schedule?  Will you try to make up for bad decisions during the week? 

If you plan to use weekends as a cheat, or if you don't plan to, but often end up cheating on the weekends, try to make up for it somewhat with exercise.  I'm not saying you can out-exercise a bad diet, but if you aren't working, chances are that you have more time to get in your workouts.  So spend a few extra minutes this weekend burning calories so you can order that beer guilt-free or have a healthy dessert after dinner.

Good morning everyone!

Today is day 4 of our journey and we have a few different things to make a note of today. First off how is your day today? Doing anything interesting in the name of fitness? What do you plan to do today to further yourself towards your goals? Let us know!

We had toyed with some groups before in the past and it turns out to be a modding nightmare when we tried to split it up enough. We found that with a few larger groups though we are able to help more people by being more consistent. In these groups you will find posts for [Runners](http://redd.it/149bd3), [Students](http://redd.it/14b427), and definitely [Women Losing Weight](http://redd.it/14bpkr). 

I may not be a woman but I am happy to see that so many are able to band together to work on bettering themselves. It is awesome to see. If you fit into one of these categories you are more than welcome to join into the discussions.

Also if you have not done so please check out the sidebar specifically to sign up for this new round of 90days.

Now for some basic info we want to let you know about:

* If you are a member of Fitocracy or want a want a website to help you track your workouts join Fitocracy. We have some challenges going on this round and you can find the information [in this post.](http://redd.it/13z130)



* There are going to be some goal setting posts. Definitely look into these and see if you can get yourself setup with some obtainable simple goals. I highly recommend this. 

* Feel free to also participate in the [weekly challenge](http://redd.it/146k6h)! 

Go forth and be fit!

If you have any questions send us a modmail or post. We are always happy to help when we can.",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,gold1,True,t3_14dsoe,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/14dsoe/daily_goal_day_4_december_6th/,
1354285681.0,15,self.90daysgoal,141w5g,[Goal Setting] What goals will get you what you want?,16,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/141w5g/goal_setting_what_goals_will_get_you_what_you_want/,"“Failing to plan is planning to fail”

So now you have a [conceptual idea of what you want](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/13zz4f/goal_setting_what_do_i_want). It’s time to break that conceptual idea into an implementation plan. You want to break complexity down into small, achievable steps. The steps should be broken down as far as they need to go. If your goal is to run a marathon, then the first step may be as simple as going for a 5 minute walk every day next week. If you can’t walk for 5 minutes, walk for 1 minute. If you can’t walk for 1 minute, then stand in your driveway for 5 minutes. Everything should be broken down into steps that are impossible to fail at. The concept is very [Kaizen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen). The first step is to create goals. 

Goal achievement consists of three basic steps. 

1. Create and Document [SMART goals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
2. Break the goals down into detailed plans. Break them down as far as you need to ensure success. 
3. Execute the plans exactly as detailed. Hold the line. 

Create your goals using the SMART method. Make sure each goal has every element documented. 

* Specific - Be very specific about the goal. 
* Measurable - Have every goal be pass/fail with a distinct measurement to determine success.
* Attainable - Make the goal something that can be achieved. 
* Relevant - It’s gotta be something you WANT. Without desire, the chances of success are lessened. 
* Timely - Put a date on it. Heck, put an hour and a minute on it. 

Creating goals are all about timelines. A wise person once said “There are no unrealistic goals, only unrealistic deadlines”. The secret to goal achievement is to be realistic about timelines. When creating goals, I usually use 5 different timelines and have goals that are broken down from top to bottom. Not all of my goals hit every timeline. The timelines I use are: 

5 Years, 1 Year, 1 Quarter (90 days), 1 Week, 1 Day

Let’s do an example by looking at one of my life divisions. 

* Physical - maintain a healthy weight, stay fit cardiovascularly, look good, be in the best shape of my life on my 40th birthday.

So what goals can I set that would achieve these attributes? I believe that participating in races is a great way to ensure I am running enough, which is what I consider one of the keys to achieving what I want. So essentially, I need to run as many races as it takes to ensure that I am training for those races for most of the year. For me, that’s about 4 races per year, one per quarter. They don’t have to match up directly with my 90 day goal completion dates. 

For 2013, I have a new goal. I will participate in 4 different races during the year. This goal contains all the SMART elements, especially the Attainable one! I can do this. I will do this and it will make me happy. 

What are your goals? 

Tomorrow we will talk about implementing the plan to achieve the goals and breaking it down!",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,,True,t3_141w5g,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/141w5g/goal_setting_what_goals_will_get_you_what_you_want/,

First, let's start out with [this awesome directory](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/fugnw/food_archive_of_auntrhubarbs_helpful_food_posts/) that was started by [AuntRhubarb](http://www.reddit.com/user/AuntRhubarb) detailing many useful foods and their nutritional information as well as recipes and ideas for them provided by users. Feel free to add on here with more helpful foods and we'll get them added to the directory. I will also be taking over the weekly useful foods portion. We'll get more specific next week.

Now, [Nineinchskywalker](http://www.reddit.com/user/Nineinchskywalker) has graciously offered to help me out by handling the Vegetarianism/Vegan portion of my weekly food and diet posts.  I am posting the text on her behalf:

Vegatarian and it's varities are the most popular diet/lifestyle choices in the world. Health, religion, culture, and many more reasons are attributed to the diet. Inside the veg diet there are also [many different ways](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism#Varieties_of_vegetarianism), which makes it all the more interesting to me. I can go on and on about it, but it's all about you. So tell us, who are you, which veg diet do you follow, and anything else you'd like to share. - Nineinchskywalker

**My Goals**

- Get under 50% body fat **achieved** (according to my home scale. at the gym, I'm 10% lower on bf)

- Lose 25 lbs **not achieved** - 19.5 lbs lost

My setbacks included a back injury (healed now), being diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, having a tubal ligation surgery, and getting infections from the surgery. I am healed from the surgery and infections but my stamina and energy are gone right now.

I followed a ketogenic diet for most of it. The first time I was on it, I found it hard to stick to. Going off, the carbs gave me digestive issues and impeded my healing from surgery, once I figured that out and went back on, my issues went away and so did the pain. It's much easier to avoid the carbs when there's a pain principle associated!

For the next round I am going to work even harder towards my goals since I can see results now and I'm motivated. The Fibro could be an issue but it's not right now and I refuse to stress about something that I can't control right now. I'm also focusing more on sleeping because it's something I just can't seem to do these days. As well, getting my energy up so I can get back to where I was in weightlifing before everything went to crap with my health.

All in all, I'm fairly happy with my round results and I can't wait until we start the next round. Thank you all for the love and support!!",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,self4,True,t3_s6534,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/s6534/progress_my_90_days/,

Cool, unconventional advice like: stick notes everywhere in your home, saying things like: ""*come on, you can do it!*"" and ""*don't give up now*"" in order to keep you focused ALL THE TIME. I asked for more advice and motivation and he shared two inspirational stories about changes and focus, I'd like to share them with you too :)

""I was always fat from the age of about 12-13, started stealing money from my parents and friends to get as much food as I possibly can down my throat. It was getting to the point where I would be eating about 5000-6000 calories a day at 15 years old. Hit my peak weight of 300lbs at 18 years old and decided to do something about it. Started eating right and doing a lot of exercise; instantly life was better. I was able to focus on work, able to handle friendships/relationships better and life was all around much better. 

About 2 years after that I was looking a LOT better and my outlook on life had completely changed. I had little fat on me and my muscles were a LOT bigger. The summer 2 years after starting I decided to imitate a guy known online as ""[zyzz](http://images.smh.com.au/2011/08/13/2555915/art-353-pg5-zyzz-200x0.jpg)"", real name Aziz Shavershian (may he RIP). He was known by the online bodybuilding community as a joker who frequently went to festivals in [nothing but short shorts](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VRa8aFKUywM/Tab5gT7NspI/AAAAAAAAAKE/CDibQwC-tjg/s1600/zyzz+aesthetics.jpg), sactual and trainers. He was a legend and although he may seem like a pretentious dick, he was a damn nice guy. I had joked around with friends about doing this for a while but had never actually decided to go for it. So I went to a festival wearing some fairly long shorts and a slightly tight shirt and a friend decided to bring along some short shorts as a joke, didn't really want to go for the whole just short shorts thing but a load of girls decided that they wanted to see my body and as a result off came the shirt and on went some short shorts. For the rest of that festival (4 day event) I walked round in nothing but short shorts and trainers. I felt like god, my ego was massive and the attention was incredible. 

It was so very different to everyone making fat jokes behind my back, it was surreal. There were moments where I would be dancing to some house/trance style music and I would remember what I used to look like or how I used to act and I would laugh. It was a very comical experience. I'm happy with life now, happier than ever. I'm single and have been since I was 18. Saying that because many people think that instantly you'll get into a relationship when you lose the weight, but it doesn't work like that. 

One thing that I do dislike is the way many now see me. People assume I'm some uneducated meathead who obviously has done steroids. This isn't true, especially the steroid bit since I don't even take supplements, and although it's true I'm not all that smart, I'm not as blindly ignorant as many perceive me to be. Doesn't really bother me but it's the main source of my dislike for people with unaesthetical bodies who throw insults at me, since I assume that they're jealous of the hard work and dedication I've put in for my body. As a result it's made me dislike anyone who supports ""fat can be healthy"" campaigns since they're just damn wrong. This is the only real negative aspect of the whole weight loss.


Another story I can give you is about a very close friend of mine. She was in an abusive relationship with someone who called her fat on a daily basis and although it didn't get to the point of hitting it was damn close. She was overweight, yes, but not massively so. She came to me asking for some help and advice after she had a big argument with her boyfriend. I told her that I would guide her and give her PT for free. 

Every morning I would see her at 6am and we would exercise, we would eat VERY healthily and I would educate her about fitness and health. After only about 2 months she had already lost &gt;20 pounds and was starting to look really good. Her strength had increased massively and for her weight/sex/height she was doing damn well. She decided that she needed to break up with her boyfriend who she had been occasionally seeing during those 2 months. This guy was overweight himself and did literally no exercise so as a result had almost no muscle. It got to the point where he pushed her and she pushed him back. He tried to throw a punch but this girl dodged out of the way and could easily outrun him. Apparently he started crying and she laughed and left with her stuff. 

All the other stories are just about people losing weight and looking/feeling better with themselves and getting compliments but no real stories. So far I've helped I think it's about 15 people lose weight, from 10lbs to 120lbs. Some really good progress from some people.""

* 1 small box raisins
* 1T gluten free vanilla extract
* 1t of coconut oil
* 1 cinammon stick
* 1/2 a lemon or lime
* Cinammon powder
* Handful of crushed walnuts
* Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Basically, you take your apple core-er(?) and from the top, start the core your apple.  Instead of going all the way through, leave the bottom intact for stuffing--just make sure to take out core/seeds.  

Take your 1t of coconut oil and shove it inside of the apple.  Then, get about 1/2 the raisins from your box (I used Sun Maid) and toss them lightly in the vanilla extract.  After they have been coated, shove them into the apple along with the cinammon stick.  Now you have your stuffed apple.  Place it on a baking tray and sprinkle with your crushed walnuts &amp; cinammon.  Also, put a generous squeeze of lemon/lime juice over the apple.

Place in the oven for 20 minutes, then lower to about 300 for another 10 minutes.

1317412437.0,13,self.90daysgoal,kwt3v,As per request: Biking AMA.,14,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/kwt3v/as_per_request_biking_ama/,"I am a competitive cyclist and professional bike mechanic and enthusiast. I'm also involved in a local group of middle-aged folks who have just started biking, and I'm happy to say one of them has lost over 40 pounds in the last year.

Biking is my way to get cardio exercise; I hate running/jogging, it hurts, it takes a whole bunch of energy to not go fast, and unless you have awesome form it just looks awkward. Biking on the other hand is low to no impact, you get to sit down while exercising, you get to go fast, and it supports your weight so within an hour or so you can get to a point where you don't look awkward and can feel graceful on a bike.

Biking is particularly useful for those of you who are looking to lose weight. Within 60 days, physiological changes will start to happen, your liver will become much better at using glycogen so you will store less fat and be able to burn what you have much more easily. Biking is more effective than running for this because to train your liver you must be at what is called the ""Lactic acid threshold"" which is the point where you are producing as much lactic acid (the chemical that makes you sore) as your liver can eliminate. Lactic acid threshold is a function of your heart rate and because you are only using your legs and core when biking, it is easier to control your heart rate.

For weight loss you should train at your lactic acid threshold, which will be the point where you are breathing heavily, but still able to speak in full sentences. You should try to keep this level of exertion for an hour when your starting out. Track your speed or distance so you will be able to track your progress and not feel like you're not getting anywhere, but don't train with it, 5 miles into a 10mph will be a lot harder to do than 15 with a tailwind. Instead your training should focus on keeping yourself at that exertion level for as long as you can, if you can only manage to ride 5 miles your first week that's fine.

For best results pick up a heart-rate monitor at a bike/running shop, pick the cheapest model since you only need the current heart rate. Pay attention to your BPM at the lactic acid threshold and try to keep it pegged within 5 BPM of that point. Keep in mind that it could take up to 5 minutes for your HR to equalize to your exertion so don't make wild adjustments to your pace. You won't notice your heart rate improving with training because it isn't supposed to what will change is the speed and duration of your exertion. That is to say, what will change is your resting heart rate and the BPM it takes to do the same task. For instance, one of my riders was pushing 97 BPM just standing in his kitchen making dinner, yet after a month of biking his heart rate was 80 while doing the same task.

If you do train with a heart-rate monitor make sure that you don't compare your data with others. Everybody's heart works differently, one of my fellow competitive cyclists has a lactic acid threshold of 120, mine is 158, and another of our team-mates is at 165, but we reach those rates at the same speed.

The bike you use really doesn't matter when you are just starting out, what you need to worry about is the fit. When you are riding and you have a pedal at 6 o'clock your leg should be fully extended without being locked. A good rule of thumb is that if you put your heel on the pedal at 6 o'clock your leg should be locked. At this saddle height make sure the rest of the bike fits, if not you may need a different size. Bikes are like shoes, you can fit in a size too big or too small but if you walk around in it for too long it's going to suck. 
If you are noticing that you have knee pain before you are getting tired it is likely because your saddle is not the right height. 

So with that out of the way feel free to ask me anything.

Please, please don't think that you can mess up the group statistics with your information. The only way to mess up statistics is to ignore the data you don't like, to mold it into a result that you want to see. But it's unrealistic and unfair for us to only include big losses. For us to have meaningful group statistics, we really need as much information from as many people as possible, no matter what the information is. *All results are important.*

It's easy to check in if you liked your results, but it's much harder and more impressive to check in if you didn't. Checking in with your results tells me how many people are still here, thinking about their health and fitness. The number of people who don't check in should indicate how many people stopped paying attention to the subreddit over the past 90 days. Those who lost interest, unsubscribed, or forgot about it. So if you're still here, reading this, please take a minute to check in.

Also remember, *the number on the scale is not the most important indicator of your progress*. The best victories are smaller and harder to measure. Little changes in your mindset or habits.

I'm 22 years old and I'm a Network Administrator to pay the bills. 

I already started making changes near the end of 2010. I moved to a new state and I had a new environment to make things happen. I started eating better. I cut out soda, junk food, and microwavable meals which used to be my usual diet. I'd always use the excuse ""Oh I'm too tired/busy to cook."" Fuck that, not anymore. The house I'm living in only had healthy food so it was easy to jump into. Whole grains, veggies, and better portions started right off the bat. I lost about 10 pounds alone from that. 

Then January I started working out. I hate new years resolutions, but it was time to get serious. I go to Gold's Gym as much as I can. Some days I would be at work for 12 hours so I would fall out of the routine and feel crappy. But I just kept going. I had to try again the next day many times. I had a trainer that helped give me ideas for workouts and once I was on my own I felt confident. I lost another 10 pounds since then.

Well now it's April 5th. I told myself by July 4th I would be 130. I'm 146 today. Granted, my body fat went down from 33% to 28%. I feel much stronger. I look decent but I'm not happy with my body yet. Yesterday I signed up for the 100 pushups and 200 squats challenge. I talked to my boyfriend about P90X and I will be starting that soon. 

It's time to step it up. I have made progress, but I feel I could be much better by now. 

No more bullshit. 89 days and counting. By the time there is fireworks in the sky and we're celebrating Amurrikuh I'm going to wear a bikini and look super hot to celebrate my greatest personal accomplishment ever.

And I'm on day 4 of no alcohol. Which seems like nothing but I've had to turn down 2 happy hours already. I'm not having a delicious beer again until May 22nd when I complete the Maryland Warrior Dash. So I'll be attending Opening Day for baseball on March 31st...without beer. This is big.

The quinoa seeds are taken from the flower, and have a taste and consistency not dissimilar to wild rice.  Most large stores will carry quinoa in a world foods/health foods aisle.

The good thing about quinoa is its protein content is much higher than rice or wheat, up to 18%.  It also has a balanced set of essential amino acids, and plenty of fiber.  It is also gluten free (though derivatives, like quinoa flour, for instance, may not be).

Quinoa can be prepared just like white rice, and in rice cookers as well.  It swells on cooking similarly to rice.  It can be used as a substitute for rice, small pasta, even oats.  

Quinoa is great as a healthier alternative to rice in chillis, instead of couscous in pilafs or other dishes, it can be added to salads, or served as an extra vegetable in a regular ""meat and two veg"" kind of way, typically substituting for a potato.

You can also find foods made with quinoa derivatives, such as pasta made from quinoa flour.  I've not tried these myself.

Here's a decent alternative :),16,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/e7b0a/missing_rice_heres_a_decent_alternative/,"Ok, so, I usually get laughed at when I mention this to others, but thought I should give it a go here. As it's something that's really REALLY helped me in the past (and my dad too).

I find rice to be a really good buffer food in a meal, and don't really feel too full without it. So cutting it out is really quite hard and annoying. But when you look at the stats, [130 calories per 100 grams](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5712/2). Not cool.

My proposed alternative.

**Cauliflower Rice!**

Ok, so I know many people hate it, and it's not on the top of your list for side dishes, but it really works. According to [Nutrition Data](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2391/2), not only is Cauliflower way more filling than white rice, but it also has less than 20% of its equivalent of white rice in calories. That means 23 calories per 100 grams.

The taste may be the biggest contributor to the ""ew"" factor. But if you mix the cauliflower with a stew which you'd usually use rice with, then the smell and taste of the cauliflower goes away. *You're left with the same buffering effect that you get from rice*.

**Cooking Instructions**

Cooking is INCREDIBLY easy. Half a head of cauliflower is usually enough for two BIG servings.

* Cut the cauliflower head into florets that fit into a food processor
* Blend until you get the cauliflower to the desirable size
* Place in microwave safe dish, cover, and cook for 5 minutes on high

Feel free to season to taste as well

That's it. All of it done in less than 10 minutes.

What is Tasty Tuesday you ask?  Its an opportunity to discuss food, and food related topics. Its new this round, and I’m hoping that you will find it an interesting resource.  Some of the topics I plan to talk about this round are:


* Healthy cooking
* Slow cooker meals
* Cooking for larger groups
* Students (cooking for one, limited supplies / equipment)
* Kid friendly food
* Favourite recipes
* Relatively healthy cheat meals
* Cooking techniques
* Different diet themed recipes (keto, paleo, vegan)


Is there anything else you would like to see talked about during this round?


I know that you all have been doing lots of introductions so far, but I’d love it if you could take a moment to introduce yourself and tell me what you would want to get out of this thread.


My questions today for you are:
* What did  you have for dinner yesterday? 
* Was it something you planned ahead of time?
* How far ahead do you normally plan your meals?
* What percentage of your meals do you eat out vs. something you have prepared?

On a happier note, I did my first ever trail run yesterday.  I did a total of ~5 miles, running along some excellent trails at a nearby park.  What a great time!  I enjoyed it much better than slogging along local roads.  So much more to see, and the trails were much easier on my feet/legs.

How about you?  What are your goals for today?

Have fun!

Nox

How are you all doing this fine morning (or afternoon, depending on your geographical location)?  What's going on today?  How was your weekend?  Did you do anything awesome?

We've talked a bit about diets over in the Daily Goal posts, but I want to continue this conversation a bit.  Diet, after all, is a huge part of weight loss.  Exercise is important, no doubt, but you can't out exercise a bad diet.

The easiest part of a diet, I've found, is the stuff I eat for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  It's planned out and I know what I'm eating.  Snacking, however...

How do you guys deal with **snacking**?  It can be at work, where you have access to vending machines, or at home, where you have all your food at your finger tips.  It can also be at a party or someone else's house (family, etc), who might not have the best of food choices available.  What do you do?  How do you manage it?  Do you bring your own snacks all the time?  Do you bring your own snacks some times?  How do you deal with snacking at home?  Do you have any tips or tricks?

This topic might bleed a little into emotional eating, which is something else we will be discussing later, but if that comes up, then by all means, go ahead and talk about it.

I hope everyone has a great day!

Welcome to Round 10! If this is your first round with 90dg, feel free to check out our [Introduction Thread] (http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1ajlw3/mod_official_introduction_thread_for_round_10/) if you haven’t already :)

**Who we are**

Women Losing Weight (WLW) is a group within [/r/90daysgoal] (http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/) that is aimed specifically towards women. We are a dedicated &amp; passionate group of ladies that are after the same goal: to better our lives. Some of us are trying to lose weight. Some of us are trying to gain. But all of us are in need of support &amp; motivation and we hope you will find that here with us. WLW is run by the fantastic [/u/uninvitedthirteenth] (http://www.reddit.com/user/uninvitedthirteenth), the amazing [/u/nanochic] (http://www.reddit.com/user/nanochic), and myself, [/u/dinosaurdinosrawr] (http://www.reddit.com/user/dinosaurdinosrawr/).  We’ll be posting WLW threads on Mondays (nano, but I’m subbing for her this week while she is on vacation!), Wednesdays (unin), and Fridays (myself).

**What we do**

WLW does not have a set goal within our time. Our initiative is to encourage &amp; help one another on our journey towards change. We want to target gender specific issues that you could be dealing with during this round. Ideally, we'd also love to get to know one another beyond just our weight &amp; exercise routine. We want to know more about you.

**You**

Day 01 is always, undoubtedly, one of the busiest days of the round. So in an effort to minimize the odds of feeling overwhelmed, I want today to be a casual, welcoming &amp; open day of discussion. Let us know who you are. Have you decided on a plan of action/ end goal? If so, what is it? If you haven't thought about it, please take the time to do so today. Let's kickstart this round off on the right foot. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them :D

I hope you all are having a wonderful day. I personally don't have a valentine but by sheer luck I was on a date until late last night and decided to count that :P

How is everyone doing today? I know Valentine's Day is a lesser holiday but it can still be plagued by chocolate. Just remember to do what you think is necessary with it! If you dont need it then stray away or make sure to let the significant other know. On the other hand it is a small holiday and a nice dinner with honey bear might be in order! If you do just compensate a little with some extra activity. It will all work out in the end. 

I personally have a nice 3 hour climbing session planned for tonight haha I am more in love with the gym plastic than any women currently so I plan to spend it there. I figure anyone else there will be single too!

Anyways go forth and be lovey dovey.

I hope you are all having a fantastic start to your week.  I am about to head to the gym myself.  Getting a much later start than normal, but I've started scheduling doctor's appointments monday mornings at 9-10ish so I can ease into the week.  :)

Today's topic is **Go-To Meals**.  Now that we are a week into our new year, hopefully fully invested in our new year's resolutions, we might be realizing that weekdays are busy and it's hard to spend as much time cooking during the week as we might on the weekend.  So what are those meals you can throw together either for lunch or dinner?  What are your quick-meal secrets?

For me, one of my favorite go-to meals is chicken salad.  I borrowed from another person here the idea of mixing the chicken with mustard and greek yogurt instead of mayo.  One can makes a 200 calorie meal (or like 300-350 if you eat it with bread/crackers).  It's easy, delicious, and I can bring it with me to work for lunch if necessary.  One of my other secrets is to cook up a lot of chicken, cut it up, and then put it in the freezer in individual containers.  Then on a night I can grab one, toss it with some veggies and some sort of sauce (usually from a jar), and eat with rice.  Usually super quick/easy during the week, and I can get 2-3 meals out of one container of chicken.

So what about you all?  How are you all doing this fabulous Monday?",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,self5,True,t3_16483j,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/16483j/wlw_january_7_2013/,

How did yesterday go for you?  What did you do?  What do you have planned for today?  What about this weekend?

The holidays are fast approaching for many of us and with holidays come **temptations**.

How do you deal with temptations?  What sorts of things tempt you?  Is it food, drinks, and/or a nice warm fire to curl up in front of and not have to move all day?  Temptations don't have to be food or drink.  They can also be prospects of being lazy and taking time off.  How do you combat these temptations?

When surrounded by good food and family trying to feed you, what do you do?  Do you have a plan for how to tackle this situation?  What about when you go out with friends you may not have seen for a long time?

If you don't know how you're going to deal with these situations, sit down and come up with a plan.  Work through it and try to figure out what might trigger you to cheat on a diet or exercise.

I hope everyone has a great weekend, safe travels if you're going somewhere, and an awesome holiday!

Don't let your mind trick you. This is a 15 week endevour. 90 days, not 21. 

What happens is simple - this is the week where the excitement of doing something new wears off. Every one of your friends and family have seen the changes you made and it's become normal to them. It's no longer exciting to wake up every morning and do something new because it's not new anymore - it's your life now.

But that's where your mind tricks you. Let's get something straight. It's easier NOT to go to the gym. It's easier to NOT eat healthy. It's easier NOT to have the self discipline to do that daily work to achieve a long term goal. But to quote JFK, we do not do these things because they are easy - but because they are hard. We do these things because we know we are different and there is greatness within reach of each of us. 

Hold that line. 

Last week, I not only did my optimal week, but I actually ran an extra day and did an extra day of yoga. It offset some of the bad eating so I don't want to gloat too much. 

**This Week**

* Mon - Lunch meeting with pizza. Must make sure to run to hit my calorie goals and I am going to bring a protein bar to eat about 30 minutes before. 
* Tue - normal day, weights and yoga after work. 
* Wed - Lunch out with the wife and kid so I will need to run that afternoon. 
* Thu - Lunch with old colleague. Lift that day. 
* Fri - normal day + running.
* Sat - nothing exciting. Maybe some yoga.

We made it through the work week!  Give yourself a huge pat on the back!

Technically, I am posting a little early but since Im on the road right now, this is the best time for me to do it.  How is everyone feeling?  How do you feel that you did this week?  Is there anything you wish you would have done differently?  Let's hear it!  If anyone is struggling--feel free to let us know!  We are here to support you.

Alright ladies, welcome to **Food Friday**!  This is our time to share recipes, swap ideas, show off your culinary creations &amp; share recommendations. 

So my contribution to this edition of FF is [Sausage Stuffed Tomatoes](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m87jmiaD4k1qbuha4o1_500.jpg).For all you Paleo people out there, this is a Lacto-Paleo recipe that can *easily* be modified to a more strict Paleo diet.

**Ingredients**

* 1lb Mild Italian Sausage
* 1lb Ground Beef
* Mushrooms
* 1 Green Bellpepper
* 1/2 Onion
* Small can of tomato paste
* 6 *firm* tomatoes

Carefully hollow out the tomatoes.  Save the pulp (?)  from two tomatoes to use later.  Basically, you cook the sausage &amp; ground beef together (I add salt/pepper/rosemary/thyme/basil/marjoram).  Once its nearly browned, I add the the onion, mushrooms&amp; bellpepper until tender.  Then I toss in the tomato paste &amp; .  Basically--its like a pizza stuffed into a tomato.  Fill the tomatoes &amp; sprinkle a bit of cheese on top.  Pop into the oven 350 degrees for about 10 minutes.  Then you may consume without guilt! :D

So how about you?  Get in here &amp; share with the rest of us :) &amp;don't forget to support your fellow WLW'ers!

It's Day 03 &amp; lets get it started on a good note!  Yesterday, we all discussed our motivations for change:  Some of us are doing it for our health, others for their children, some of us are doing it to look good in a bathing suit, and some of us are doing it to add on muscle.  We all may have varying reasons for change but the important thing is that we are all here &amp; in this together.  And so, right now I'd like to share this quote that Ive used before.  I love it.  &amp;I feel like no matter what your situation, you can identify with it.

&gt; I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. - Michael Jordan

Success is not measured by only winning.  Success is had by the struggle, the endurance--the blood, sweat and tears to get to your goal.  Be proud of yourselves--even in your ""failures.""  Because more than anything, even in those moments can you find your strength.

&amp;that brings us to today's topic: **Social Situations**.  Oh, girl.  You know what Im talking about.  It's lunch time at work &amp; it's your co-workers birthday.  Cake for everyone!  Or...its girls night &amp; your best friend made this AMAZING pasta.  Or...maybe you're just driving down the street with your SO when they point to a diner and say, ""Hey Ive been wanting to try this place!""  How do you deal?  Do you cave to social pressure?  Do you look for something unoffensive on the menu?  Do you ask your friends to be supportive of your choices?  Alcohol and food can be a very tempting vice when we are trying to eat healthy.  So how do you deal?

So get in here!  Let us know what is going on in your world. How did you do on your goals yesterday?  &amp;as I mentioned in WLW comments yesterday, **Please remember to interact with your fellow gals**.  We want everyone to feel welcome &amp; to keep the momentum alive!

Yesterday, we talked about our game plan, our goals, and who we all are.  There's a lot of amazing women in this round, so let's stick together and help each other through it!  Don't be afraid to comment or ask questions - we're so varied, someone might have the answer or know exactly what you're going through.

**Today**

Some of you already touched upon this, but I want to hear from all of you: what's your motivation?  Why are you doing this round?  What is going to keep you going after a few weeks, when things get tough?  Do you have any good motivation sites to share with us?  I know there's some awesome tumblrs out there.  One of my personal favorite is [this](http://reasonstobefit.tumblr.com/) one.

Of course, it's easy to lose motivation and get frustrated when you don't see the scale move (or not move in the right direction).  You see yourself every day so you won't see the minute changes happening to your body.  Your friends and loved ones won't see it because it's so gradual.  So I have a challenge for all of you women - go to ""before"" pictures.  I know they're not going to be pretty and I know they're embarrassing, but if you don't take them, you won't see the differences until much, much later.  Plus, those pictures might help motivate someone else!

What do you have planned for today?

I make sure I do plenty of research before trying any supplement.  The first place I go is Silverhydra's [examine.com](http://examine.com), which is an excellent reference site for many supplements.  Another great reference is the [interactive Snake Oil infographic](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/play/snake-oil-supplements/).

When I'm ready to purchase a supplement, I use [ConsumerLab](https://www.consumerlab.com/) - which is kind of like Consumer Reports for supplements.  They do independent testing of many supplements and then publish their results online.  It costs a  little over $30/year, but well worth it in my mind.

How about you?  


Have fun today!

**Let's talk about your muscles today.**

Your body is a machine, your muscles are such a huge part of that machine and yet we are told, as women, that cardio is all we need. Well, it's simply not true. [7 Myths of Women's Weight Training](http://bodybuilding.about.com/od/womensfitnesstopics/a/womenmyths.htm)

How many of you work out? Bodyweight exercises, sports, lifting weights, etc? And how many of you look like a man because of it? None, right?

Losing fat is great, but having the muscle tone underneath once the fat comes off will not only make you look and feel great, you burn more calories over the course of the day.

I am going to give you ladies the best resource I have: [Exercise &amp; Muscle Directory](http://www.exrx.net/Lists/Directory.html). This is singularly the most helpful thing I've found since I started this journey last year. Just click the body part and it will take you to a list of exercises (weights and bodyweight) to target it. Awesome, right?

We'll talk more about our muscles in the coming weeks!

Sometimes when we see ourselves in the mirror every day, it can be difficult to realize that our bodies are changing.

We are graduate psychology students from University of Montreal and University of Quebec in Trois-Rivieres and we are interested in various subjects related to self-regulation of physical activity behaviour. One of us has been a participating member of 90daysgoal for the past 2 rounds and after seeing how 90days work, we came up with a few ideas that we would like to introduce to you.  
The main objective of the project for which we ask for your help is to gain a better understanding of how different attitudes toward physical activity interact together in the adoption and maintenance of a regular physical activity behaviour. A secondary objective is to confirm the validity of some measures in the questionnaires we use. More detailed information about the project is available at the start of the questionnaire to help you understand what your participation implies and to make an enlightened decision about it.  
  
Your task in this research project is to fill this questionnaire, of a duration of 10 to 15 minutes. At the end of each month for the 3 next months, you will be asked to fill a shorter version of this questionnaire, of a duration of 5 minutes. By helping us, you will help to improve the understanding of physical activity adoption and maintenance mechanism. By filling the questionnaires you might get a better insight on your physical activity practice and summary of findings and stats will be presented to the community at various moments in the round.  
  
Here is the [LINK](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/exerciseprofile) for the first questionnaire.  
  
We do hope this project caught your interest. Feel free to ask us if you have any questions, but we would appreciate that you don’t discuss the particular items of the questionnaires on the main posts since it could influence other participant’s answers.  
  
Thank you very much for your help in making this project work

1333829109.0,13,self.90daysgoal,ry92x,[PROGRESS] M/25/177 -&gt; 167.8/Weight Lifting,14,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/ry92x/progress_m25177_1678weight_lifting/,"Happy day 90! The last check in told us to post our own results/progress thread, so I'm giving it a shot. I didn't see any templates, so hopefully just winging this works.

My 90 days was roughly split into two parts - the first 9 weeks were mostly a ""cut"" where I was focused on losing weight as healthily and quickly as possible, with some minor exercise built in.

The last 3 weeks I finally bought a real weight set and started a modified version of the ""Starting Strength"" program and I'm currently working through that on a ""bulk"" program.

**Starting Stats/Goals**

Male/177 lbs/6'3""/25 years old

Unknown BF%, 34.5"" waist. No prior weight lifting/running/anything really experience.

* Lose 11 pounds, go from 177 to 166
* Start a consistent workout routine, 3x/week
* Get below 15% body fat
* Be able to do 55 crunches
* Be able to do 15 pushups

**Diet**

My plan for the 90 days was basic, but effective. Stop drinking soda, and instead of eating out at lunch 4-5 times a week at work, cut that down to no more than 1-2 times per week. 

I was extremely committed to both of these. This entire year I've actually had nothing to drink except water and milk (and the occasional beer/alcohol, but I'm not cutting that out!). It's definitely made a huge difference.

In terms of cutting fast food out at lunch, I dove right in. Bought a ton of tupperware, a ton of ziploc bags, and found out what I could make quickly and easily the night before. Not a whole lot of groundbreaking ideas here, but for completeness:

Breakfast: Whey protein/Milk, Oatmeal + Cinnamon

Lunch: Wraps (Chicken, Spinach, Cheese), Apples, Cottage Cheese, Oranges, Hard Boiled Eggs. Lots and lots of chicken varieties.

Dinner: Chicken. Chili. Pasta. Low carb ""pizzas"" (low carb tortilla + sauce + cheese). Rice. 

Snacks: Apples. Bananas. Lots and lots of whey shakes. 

Overall I think I was successful with my diet because it was really simple. I'd buy something like 20-25 ingredients and just mix and match them. Everything goes with chicken. 

The first 9 weeks was spent on a fairly strict 750-1000 kCal deficit. I was running a roughly 50% protein, 30% fat, 20% carb split. 

The last 3 weeks as I moved over to a more intense weight lifting program I basically reversed my diet, and moved to a +750-1000kCal surplus, which shifted me from eating around 1500Cals a day to around 3500. Same food, just started eating more of it.

**Exercise**

Started off slow - did some basic at home bodyweight exercises: jumping jacks, push-ups, leg raises, squats, crunches, etc. Spent the first 9 weeks doing this along with your basic dumbbell exercises. I don't truly believe it did much in terms of calories burned or muscle gained, but it proved to me that I could stick with a routine for 9 weeks, even if it was ""pointless"". 

Currently i'm in between my third and fourth weeks of the starting strength program. I'm weak as hell, but I'm loving it so far.

**Results**

No pictures, sorry! Maybe for R7...

* Weight: 177 -&gt; 167.8 lbs. My goal was 166. I actually hit the 164.4lb mark back in week 9, and since then I've been gaining slightly while trying to put on muscle.
* Waist: 34.5"" -&gt; 33""
* Pushups: 0 to 13
* Crunches: 0 to 25 unweighted, 10 decline/weighted @ 25 lbs
* Bench Press: 0 to 3x5 @ 81.8 lbs
* Press: 0 to 3x5 @ 55 lbs
* Squat: 0 to 3x5 @ 108.2 lbs
* Deadlift: 0 to 1x5 @ 182 lbs

**Overall**

Completely awesome 90 days. I think I've definitely made some changes that will stick, and I'm looking forward to going through another 90 days cycle with all of you!

Would be happy to answer any questions or comments, but for now I think I've typed far too much...

Hi everyone!  Let's wrap up this week with some abdominal exercises.  Today we are doing:

* Side planks 
* [Bicycle crunches](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqoD0Bdggto)

Do at least 3 sets and report in as you progress.

Your extra special challenge for the weekend is to focus on your water intake.  See if you can drink at least 1L of water per day.  Feel free to flavor it with lemon, lime, or my fave, [blue raspberry Xtend](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/sv/xtend.html) BCAAs.  Good stuff.

As always, if anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask.


Have fun,

Today was my ""off day"" from Crossfit so I got to sleep in late this morning.  Rejoice!  I have some boiled eggs &amp; fruit ready to be eaten for breakfast. &amp;leftovers for lunch.  I still am planning on getting in some cardio in after work.  I really need to improve on my running.

Lets talk: **Go-to recipes**.  You know what I mean--those days when you do NOT feel like cooking but you do regardless.  Most of those times, we have a quick meal that is our go-to recipe because its quick, easy &amp; yummy.  I want you to take a moment &amp; let us know what it is.  When we change our eating habits, sometimes ideas can get a bit stale &amp; we could use some inspiration.  So let's here it!

I am a college student junior (20 y/o) majoring in biology and chemistry. I have been a large kid mainly because my family is from bangladesh (lowest BMI in the world due to poverty) and my mom loved feeding me as a kid. I am very easy going and do what my parents tell me so that resulted in me being babied my whole life.

I was overweight and was made fun of in elementary and middle school. All that changed after I started playing football in highschool. I loved HS and it was ok for me to be fat (playing o-line) and had tons of good friends that I still keep in touch with. Here is where I was the heaviest being 224 (102 kg) and 5'10 (177.8 cm). I tore my ACL and couldn't play my last year. I went on a strict diet of 1000 calories and dropped to 180 (81.6 kg). Over my senior I gained it all back all the way back up to 224 (102 kg) mainly due to the introduction of alcohol. 

I want to be a physician. I cannot imagine telling someone to lose weight for their health while being fat. At the beginning of this year I started to change myself. No more parents doing my laundry, trying to get me to eat foods that I have no clue how many calories are in it, paying for my gas etc. 

I've managed to lose 30 lbs (13.6 kg). I have progress pics, but am not comfortable posting yet because I still feel reaallly fat. Last week I was 194 (87.9 kg). I want to get to a healthy 170. My diet consists of 1600 calories and lifting 3x a week with 2 cardio. 

Let's do it guys. I love and cherish any motherfucker in the gym that is overweight trying to make themselves better. I love seeing overweight people in the gym. One thing is that people DO NOT care if you're fat in the gym. I judge people who are fat sitting in McDonalds, not the gym. So please go there and work your ass off. Keep your workouts short and intense. Make yourself feel uncomfortable if you don't hit the gym the day you were supposed to. We can and will do amazingly. Let's extend our short lives to be with our loved ones for a couple more years.

Though I'm not a team leader (I don't think our group has one yet), I've decided to follow the idea of C25Kers post for us to get to know one another.  If you haven't yet joined our group, sign up over [here!](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsOUFG-d9pcodFZWRHZIXzUwTEhsdnBKYXdzeHAtUWc&amp;hl=en_US#gid=3)  So far there are ~~31~~ ~~35~~ ~~36~~ 40 wonderful women who have signed up to take an initiative and do something about their weight.  Congratulations to each and every one of you.

So who am I?  Well--for starters, lets disregard my username.  My *real* name is Roxanne.  I am a (freshly turned) 26 year old female from deep in the heart of Texas.  Or maybe it's more like, the leg of Texas ;)  In any case, I started my rocky relationship w/ weightloss since Round 1 of 90 Days Goal.  And let me tell you...weightloss and I?  We fight.  ALOT.  For 24 3/4 years of my life, I didn't have a weight problem.  My weight was consistent.  After losing someone very very dear to me, I suddenly started gaining weight...alot of weight due to binge eating, etc.  And here I am, a year later and about 20 lbs heavier.  And that is what I want to shed--maybe even a few pounds more.  I am now a firm believer that it is alot easier to gain than lose.  With previous rounds, I usually would fall off the wagon.  Not this time.  I am making a commitment to myself and a commitment to the team to stick this through.  And I hope you can do the same.  

Groups are a new idea to 90dg so we don't exactly have a format of how this goes.  But I'd like to start off with a few things:

* Introduce yourself.  Tell us who you are.  Tell us your goals.
* Let us know how you are planning on losing weight.
* Let us know if there is anything we can do to help you on your journey.

Above all, I think the point of having a group is that its more closed knit and that it may be easier to keep an eye on one another, as opposed to getting your post lost in a sea of daily goals.  Please remember that as a team, we struggle together.  We also triumph together.  We are here to support and offer advice as we go along.

So let's get the ball rolling today and tell us who you are!  Don't forget to support your fellow 90ers!

1308112320.0,12,self.90daysgoal,i01cq,"[Dailygoal] [To-do] Day 3 - June 15th, 2011",14,2,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/i01cq/dailygoal_todo_day_3_june_15th_2011/,"Day 3, middle of the first week! We've set our goals, we've picked our teams. I'd say it's about time to start working on our diet and exercise. Let's tackle diet today and exercise tomorrow.

We have people following all kinds of diets here, so I'll try to keep this reasonably general. Here are a couple things that I've picked up over the last few rounds:

* Don't diet, change your eating habits. Figure out your weaknesses and try to tackle those this round. Do you eat a whole bag of candy before you realize it's gone? Do you have big weekend binges after a week of healthy eating? Does drinking make you eat more? Do you tend to eat late at night? Do you eat when you're bored/stressed/alone/with friends? Do salty snacks make you crave more salty things? Do sugary snacks make you crave more sugary things? Figure out your triggers and try to recognize your old habits before you fall into them. 

* Listen to your body. Lots of people end up eating too little when they're trying to lose weight. If you're feeling drained or moody, it might be because you aren't giving your body enough fuel. That doesn't mean you should blindly start eating more though. No matter what diet you're following, I think it's useful for everyone to calculate their BMR and target calories for the weight loss rate they'd like to reach. (There's more info about this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/e6zf6/90dg_day_2_what_should_i_eat/).)Then, without changing your diet, try tracking *everything* that you eat, every day, for a week or so. MyFitnessPal, LiveStrong, LoseIt, or other similar sites should be pretty useful here. How close do you get to your target calories? If you're way below, add in some fruits and veggies and other small snacks to round out your day. If you're way over, maybe look for some alternatives to some of the biggest contributors.

* Don't deprive yourself, strive for moderation. Swearing off french fries or ice cream for the rest of your life is... mind boggling. I don't think I could do it. Eating enormous portions of fries and ice cream on a splurge day because you haven't had them in forever isn't a great idea either though. Work toward a middle road. Maybe allow yourself a small splurge once a month. Try to stick to a single serving and really savor it.

* You can lose weight and still drink alcohol. You'll have to be pretty good about it. Make some food compromises, watch what you're eating the rest of the day, aim for moderation, and savor every sip. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on alcohol might be an easy way to push through it.

* You can lose weight and still eat bread/pasta/potatoes/rice/sweets. Again, you'll just have to be good about it. Small servings of starchy/carby foods aren't going to derail your progress. But if your day consists of a bagel, a sandwich with potato chips, and pasta with a baked potato and a piece of pie, you might want to consider scaling back on the carbs and adding a lot of fruits and veggies.  If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on carbs might be an easy way to push through it.

* A specific diet might work for lots of people, but that doesn't mean it will work for you. Try it out, see how you feel, see how your weight responds, gauge how hard it will be for you to keep it up long-term. If it doesn't seem to be working for you, try to figure out which part seems to be the problem.

* The end goal is a long-term, sustainable change to our eating habits. Quick weight loss has a pretty high relapse rate. If you're nearing your long-term weight goals, start setting out a maintenance plan for yourself. Don't let yourself slip back into old bad habits. Keep an eye on your weight. Set an alarm weight for yourself, probably 5-10 lbs above your long-term goal weight. If you ever go above that weight, it's time to re-examine your eating habits and make sure you're still following your maintenance plan.

Ok, so now for the daily goals!

What's your plan for your diet this round? Do you have any questions about which diet to follow? Any questions about the diet you're already following? Are you using any websites or apps to help you keep up with your plans?

Do you have any general dieting tips that you've picked up during your journey? Anything you've read or learned the hard way?

And finally, how did things go yesterday? What are your goals and plans for today?

**Groups!**

So, in the past rounds, we've seen a pretty big drop off in participation after the initial week. There's a lot of excitement and energy at the start of the round. It's still fresh and new to read through the hundreds of daily goal posts. But as we move further into the round, it's going to get harder to keep up with everyone. You might lose track of who told you about this or that program or who it was that lives in your area. But it can be very motivating to know that others are reading your updates and following your progress, and it can even be a little discouraging as the orangereds start slowing down.

Having a smaller subset of people with similar goals might be an easier way for us to keep track of each other. Starting this round, we'd like to try out a buddy system. The idea is that you sign up for a group (or groups) that has similar interests to you. It might be a group for the diet you want to follow, or the exercise routine you're doing. It might be as general as a runners group or as specific as a runners-training-to-complete-a-5K-in-less-than-30-minutes group. Once you've joined some groups, get familiar with your teammates. Look for their posts in the daily goal threads. Help answer questions that pop up. PM them if you haven't heard from them in a while. And they'll do the same for you. You know that at the very least, this new group of friends is looking over your shoulder and cheering you on. Also, groups can put up posts intended for their teammates using a [TEAM] tag. (For instance, I'll be announcing upcoming fitocracy challenges with the [FITOCRACY] tag.) Depending on the group, you might exchange email addresses or set up an IRC channel. How each group is run is totally up to the group.

[Here is the sign-up sheet for teams.](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsOUFG-d9pcodFZWRHZIXzUwTEhsdnBKYXdzeHAtUWc&amp;hl=en_US#gid=8) The first page has a few anticipated FAQs, and I'll add more as we work through this together. This is totally new, so help us form it into a useful tool! If you have any questions, ask them here or message the mods. If you're not sure which groups to join yet, you can hold off until you've got a better idea of what your plans are. If you don't see a group that you want to join, feel free to add a new one.

Ok, so today's to-do: Take a look at the groups. Sign up for any that interest you. Add any that aren't already there.

After that, tell us what your plans and goals are for the day. Feel free to tell us which groups you joined in your goal post today. If you haven't already done so, remember to write down your short term and long term goals somewhere safe.

Anyhow, with nutrition I still need some more discipline so I have to watch closely what and how much I ate as well as hopping on the scale daily again. Not sure if I have to alter my diet a bit, but we will see once I know how my weight develops.

One thing that is fucking me up and where I have no control atm is sleep. My daughter has the habit of waking me and my wife up at about 2-4 am. This usually happens multiple times a night and takes a toll on us. Getting up early being motivated is something I just can't get done. I can't even remember the last time I slept without being disturbed by her. Hope this phase is over soon.

I've made them many times, and they're really tasty.

**Savory Breakfast Muffins**

* 2 cups whole wheat flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon pepper
* 2 eggs
* 1 1/4 cups 1% buttermilk
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 2 tablespoons butter, melted, slightly cooled
* 4 - 5 green onions, diced
* 3/4 cup diced seeded red bell pepper
* 3/4 cup diced cooked ham
* 3/4 cup cubed Jalapeno Havarti cheese

**Preparation Instructions:**

* Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 
* Spray a 12 cup muffin tin with non stick cooking spray. Set aside.
* In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and pepper.
* In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, buttermilk, oil and butter.
* Fold in green onions, bell pepper, ham and cheese.
* Make a well in the dry ingredients and add wet ingredients. Fold just until moistened. 
* Divide batter among 12 muffin tins. 
* Bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool for 5 minutes before removing muffins from tin. 

Muffins can be frozen and enjoyed at a later date.

Round 2 for me was a strange one. I remember when in #1 widdlywabbit stopped and we all went over here and kept going. Back then, we didn't even have moderators. As far as I remember, we as a community stepped forward and made that happen. At the end of #1 I really felt good we advertised and organised ourselves, ended up with a whole bunch of new people (even got our first troll) and somehow I got the feeling that that fire slowly went out...

What happened? I'd say we lost quite a few people over the holidays, but I also believe we lost a bit of the original spirit. Back in #1 it felt as if we all were pulling on one string, in #2 it felt as if I was pulling my own string and the person over there is also pulling his/her string only. I would like to see us move a bit closer as a group.

What I would like to see more of in the next round:

- More people talking in the comments and not only talking about workout / nutritiion but whatever is going on in your part of the world

- More people helping out other people

- More posts in general about our questions / experiences / movivation / whatever and those poste by everyone not just moderators. Here should be going on more than the YDG posts

Before we get started with today's post, I just wanted to say that I hope all of you (posters and lurkers, alike) are doing okay and that any of your family members/friends/teammates/etc. who were at the Boston Marathon are safe and doing alright - our thoughts are with all of those affected by this awful event :(

This week, I’d like to talk about **what you wear while running**... not just your outfit, but any gear you take with you, as well!  Sorry for what's about to be an information overload, but hopefully having a lot of this stuff in a centralized place can help those of you who might be newer to running figure out what you need and what you don't.

As spring and summer approaches, it’s starting to get warmer out and soon a lot of us might be experiencing sweltering heat and disgusting humidity, so first off let’s talk about **gearing up for the weather**.  I think that the most important way that you can gear up for the heat and humidity is by **BEING APPROPRIATELY HYDRATED**.  Dehydration and overhydration are both not good - be sure you drink *enough*, but not *too much*.

Let’s talk about **clothing** - what do you typically wear in the summer months in order to be appropriately covered but not overheated?  Keep in mind that your body will heat up when you start running, so even if you’re a little chilly before you get started you’ll likely get warmer once you start moving.  For the summer months, those moisture-wicking shirts made from synthetic materials are great for keeping you comfortable - cotton will absorb the moisture, getting heavier as you sweat more and making you more likely to overheat.  Do you wear any extra accessories, like sweat bands?  And how do you deal with funny weather, like rain and thunderstorms?  Summer is often notorious for bouts of thunder and lightning with no rain, so do you bail on your run at times like those or do you risk it?  

Now, this brings us to **extra gear**.  What do you wear or take with you in addition to your clothes?  There are a lot of supplies out there for runners, but not all of them are necessary.  Here are a few things that are pretty common, and you can decide if they are appropriate for you to have:

* GPS Watch - very useful if you are a serious runner and want a more accurate summary of your pace, distance, heart rate, or whatever else that different models offer... however, if you are just starting out and not sure if you really *love* running and want to drop a ton of cash, there are a ton of smartphone apps that you can use, provided you have one.  Some of these include Nike+ and runkeeper.  Alternatively, if you don’t have a smartphone, you can use mapmyrun.com to map out your route to see how far you are going and then just use a watch or whatever else to time yourself.  There are plenty of ways to track your distance without having to spring for a GPS watch!
* Pouch/fanny pack - there are companies that make belts that you can use to carry your stuff in, like [this] (http://www.spibelt.com).  However, before you go out and buy one, figure out if you really need it first.  These things are great for carrying your phone if you don’t wear it in an armband, they can carry your ID, car keys, gel packets, etc.  I would say that these are really practical and among the more “necessary” gear for all runners regardless of level, especially if you don’t have zipper pockets in your running clothes.  Sometimes if you have a certain kind of armband for your smartphone (the kind that fully holds the phone as opposed to one that just kind of goes around the outside like a case), you can use that as a similar pouch... for my 10mile race I forgot my Spibelt pouch at my apartment and the race was near my family’s house and I didn’t realize I was missing it until 10pm the night before the race, so in the morning I ran out to Target on the way to the race and bought an iphone armband so I could use it to hold my phone and ID during the race, and I gave my car keys to my parents but before getting my pouch I’ve knotted my headphones cord through it.
* Reflectors and Vest - these are incredibly important if you are running at certain times of day when lighting might make it tough to see, running in rough weather, or especially if you are running on routes with car traffic!  If you run on “real” roads, I would absolutely suggest getting something to make sure you are visible and wearing it regardless of weather - anything to make you stand out and as visible as possible so that oncoming cars will see you and give you a wide berth.  If you run on trails, in parks, and on pedestrian-only paths then reflective gear may not be necessarily *as* important.  It’s your call, but just remember that safety is very very important!
* Hydration belt - this really depends on personal preference and individual “ability”.  If you are running distances where you feel you need to drink during your run and you need maybe two bottles instead of just one that you can carry in your hand (or if you find it incredibly annoying to carry a bottle), then it might be a good idea.  However, before you go drop and bunch of money, try a few of these things to see if they’re suitable options:  running while carrying a water bottle in your hand, checking your route for water fountains, “hiding” water bottles along your route (especially if you run a loop).  Running with a hydration belt can be a weird feeling at first - I felt really bouncy during my first run with it, but after a few miles I didn’t even notice it anymore.
* Compression socks/calf sleeves - I haven’t ever used these and can’t really provide any anecdotal evidence about them, but I just know that they are supposed to help with circulation.  Any experienced runners out there able to provide more information?  If so, I’ll edit this main post to add the info!
* Headphones - I don’t know if this counts as gear or not, but you don’t necessarily need a pair of fancy headphones to wear while you run.  When I work out (running or lifting or anything, really) I wear a pair I got at 5 Below that wrap around my ears and keep them from falling out - I prefer to wear in-ear headphones whenever I wear headphones, and since these have the weird ear-arm thingy they’re great for activity.  They were 5 bucks, and I replace them every couple of months.  They’re also waterproof “sport” headphones, so sweat doesn’t mess them up.  
* [RoadID] (http://www.roadid.com/Common/default.aspx) - in case of an accident, it identifies you and either provides emergency contact info or directs someone to the company’s website where I think you upload everything and then they can make the proper contacts.  Again, it’s up to you whether you want to get one or not, just remember safety first!  Personally, I just take my insurance card and driver’s license and cell phone on all runs in case of emergency, but I might invest in a RoadID in the near future - better safe than sorry!
* Any other gear that I’m missing that you’re wondering about?

Hopefully those of you who are newer to running found this helpful - I know that I was really overwhelmed by what was out there in the beginning and had to ask around a lot to figure out what I actually needed and what I could wait until I had some more mileage under my belt :D  

**Now let’s hear from you, here are a few questions:**

* Feel free to share any fantastic running moments that you may have experienced over the past week - we would love to hear about them!  Alternatively, let us know if you’re experiencing any running struggles - we’re always here to help :D
* What do you wear?  Any add-ons that you don’t wear in winter?
* Weird summer weather:  how do you deal?
* What gear do you use on your runs?  
* Is there anything in particular that you think is necessary for all runners?

I'm finally back from the ski trip of awesome!  How is everyone doing today?  How did your first week go?  What do you have planned for today and the rest of the week?

As we get going into the second week, an important thing to start thinking about and cultivating is a good **support system**.  Things will get hard and you will get demotivated.  Having a good support system around you is crucial to success.  This can be in the form of your SO, your friends, your family, a personal trainer, or whatever you think will keep you going when times get tough.

What is your support system?  If you don't have one, what are you going to do?  Who are you going to recruit to keep pushing you?

Now, this isn't how are you going to keep pushing yourself; that's accountability and whatnot, which we will definitely talk about soon.  I want to know who (or what, if your pets or whatever help) is going to help you complete this round.

I hope everyone has a great day!

It’s possible that others may be noticing those changes, too, which brings us to today’s topic:  **compliments**. 

How do you (gracefully) handle any compliments you get from others?  If it’s from close friends and family, what do you usually say - do you reply with a simple “thanks” and change the subject, or do you tell them what you’ve been up to? If it’s from general acquaintances, do you usually reply the same way or do you go with something else?  **I’d love to hear how you ladies respond to compliments!**

Man what a weird week this has been. I had a real breakdown this weekend where I just could not get motivated to do anything but once the wallowing was over and I decided that I needed to move on with it I have been having a wonderful week.

If I keep working hard I will see results. And I have. Its been a great week for it. So tell us how your outlook is this week? Doing anything awesome in the name of fitness?

I have a hard time making friends and keeping them. I think it has a lot to do with my low self esteem. I know if I look better on the outside I will feel better on the inside. I will have the energy to better my life, get a job, get back on track with school etc... 
Sorry for the long sad story. I never really talk to anyone about these things and how i feel. Its so silly I even feel like crying right now. But i wont :) no more feeling sorry for myself! Let's hope this works!!

We are officially a week into Sprint 2 and the new year, so how are things going?  Did you meet your goals from yesterday?  What are you goals for today?

An important part of fitness is **sleep and recovery.**  We can't workout 3-4 hours a day and function on 3-4 hours of sleep (or, at least, I can't!).  It's super critical that you guys take some time to let your body recover, and that you get enough sleep to get rested.  Do you all get enough sleep?  Do you take days off to recover?

I *hate* taking days off.  It feels like I could be making progress but am not, so it's frustrating. I do often lift on my off-cardio days so that I'm switching it up and letting my body recover from cardio while lifting, and from lifting when I do cardio.  Is that cheating?  I also try to plan my rest days into my busy days when I'm not sure I could have gotten to the gym anyways, so that I'm not stressed trying to go to the gym, and I get my recovery time!  On that note, since I am going to see one of my favorite bands Friday night, that will be my rest day this week! 

Let us know what's going on in your world!

This week, we've talked about motivation. With this being the first week of the year, many people with new year's resolutions have been trying to make new healthy habits or reinforce old ones. Let's talk today about your changes that surprise you in some way.

What are you doing now for your health and fitness goals that you would have dismissed as impossible or unlike anything you'd ever try a year ago, 5 years ago, before you ever even started thinking about changing your lifestyle? Did you ever see yourself taking a dance class, cutting out wheat from your diet, drinking kale shakes, taking time for yourself for the first time in years to go to the gym, lifting a barbell?

How would you like to surprise yourself now? Think you'll make any changes this year that you wouldn't have dreamed of making just a few months ago?

Hope you all had an excellent New Year’s Eve and are ready to start 2013!  Any big running goals for the upcoming year?  I’d like to drop time from my half marathon and also do a full marathon!  Additionally, I’d like to improve my 5K time and get a bit speedier!  

Today’s topics are **stretching** and **crosstraining**.

**Stretching** is something that might affect your running performance - it really helps loosen you up and can help with preventing injuries.  I usually stretch a little bit before I run and for slightly longer after I run, and when I do a long run I try to foam roll ([foam rolling explained] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z0Jewgf5tI)) for a while afterwards, especially to prevent any IT Band issues.  I linger on the spots that feel the most sore or tight, and after a few painful minutes I’m usually feeling better!  I’m not sure about you guys, but I know that I feel like I can run a lot faster, and with better form and more fluid motion, when I stretch more often.

**Crosstraining** is another thing that can play a role in your running performance; it can help you build muscle, strengthen your core, condition your breathing, and increase your fitness overall.  Any form of aerobic exercise that has you using different muscles than running can be considered “crosstraining”, like cycling or swimming, or even walking.  Often times, training plans suggest you implement a day or so of crosstraining in your schedule, and they usually say that “continuous” exercises (like swimming) are best and put you at less risk for injury than “stopping-and-starting” exercises (like tennis or basketball, where you have to suddenly stop, start, or change direction).  I’m a huge fan of swimming, but I also like the elliptical and stationary bike.  

This brings us to you guys and our **questions for the day**:

* Do you stretch?  When and how??
* Do you crosstrain?  Or is running your crosstraining for something else?
* If you do, what sorts of crosstraining exercises do you usually stick with?  Do you ever switch it up at all, or do you tend to stick to the same exercise?

Hope everyone is having an awesome first day of the new year!

For many of us, it is the post-holiday season, with the final and often disappointing gasp of cheer to come with New Year's Eve next week. Then comes the new year's resolutions, and then, interminable January. It can be easy to get discouraged waiting for the season to change, whether it be bitter cold, rainy, terribly hot. It seems to be a month of ennui the later you get into it, especially coming on the heels of a busy holiday season.

Keep up with your routines - regular exercise, good food - and maybe try to get together with friends, whether in person or online, to fend off the blahs. Is there an event you'll be looking forward to at the end of next month? Maybe there should be a new holiday specific for people who start exercise and health improvements at the beginning of the year: January 23rd, Resolution Habit Day. I'd celebrate it!

Tell us how you get yourself out of the blahs. Build some support structures now so that you have something to rely on if your resolve begins to flag. Listen to your body, but don't let your brain chemicals talk you out of taking care of yourself to the best of your ability.

**Wednesday:** [Triceps dips](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Triceps/BWBenchDip.html) and [Renegade Rows](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGBYRk4j2AU). Again, three sets of each. For the triceps dips, make sure you find something sturdy to do them against. If you have a bathtub, that works great, or try the edge of the couch. If there's a park bench around, that's also a great option. If you feel like you need an extra challenge with the renegade rows, feel free to try them with [dumbbells or kettlebells](http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/renegade-row).

**Thursday:** [Wall sits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDjKeOCgisw) and [jump squats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ6KJintn70).

**Friday:** [Twisting crunch](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Obliques/BWTwistingCrunch.html) and [Supermans](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/ErectorSpinae/Superman.html)([supermen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc6UVRS7PW4)? Just do them!).

Earlier this week, we made our introductions and discussed our goals, diet, exercise, different groups within the community you can participate in, and how the Sprints function within each round. Today, let's discuss **motivation**.

Your Why: What has motivated you to get to where you are now in your food, fitness, and health journey? Did you have a health scare, an injury, a wake-up call? Did you feel it was just time, or did you come here from another subreddit after seeing an advertising thread?

Meeting the Pitfalls: If you're not making progress, if you get too busy, if you think you've outsmarted your diet just a little too much and what's the point of it all, it can be hard to be motivated to keep going. Especially during what is for many folks a holiday season - it's so easy to indulge in all the food and get caught up in planning and attending parties, working retail overtime, facing finals. I love that there has been so much participation this week, but we know that participation usually flags as the rounds progress. Keep going strong, if you can; we won't judge you if you have to drop out for a while. We'll be here to support you.

Weekend: The weekend, for many of us, is a chance to get caught up on things we meant to do earlier in the week, like go for a longer run, get in two workouts at the gym, sleep in and restore our energy, make a home-cooked meal instead of eating fast food or an armful of snacks. Are these in your plans? Are you just going to keep on keeping on?

Finally, if you've got anything that keeps your motivation high or that pulls you out of a downward spiral, let's hear about it, if you care to share. The more you think about it, the better you understand yourself and why you're doing what you're doing. We hope that enables you to continue doing it. Best of luck for the rest of your day!

I apologize for this late post - I usually tried to post on Tuesdays last round, but I forgot what day of the week it is while finishing my final paper today. And tomorrow I'm leaving town for a week! So next week's post will be late, too. Maybe I should just plan to post on Wednesdays...

In any event, welcome to Round 9! Some of you are veterans and some of you are just starting to figure things out around here, so every body introduce yourself to each other. Let us know if you're old or new, if you're trying to lose or gain, what kind of goals you've set for yourself, and what kind of challenges you expect to face! We're all coming in at a difficult time: the end of the semester is stressful, and then we're immediately confronted with home cooking, holiday parties, and weirder-than-usual hours. All of us are here to help each other, so post your difficulties, and you might get great advice from someone who's had the same problem. 

As for myself, I'm Val, humble moderator and graduate student. I'm one semester into my master's and trying to manage my weight and go back to school was surprisingly difficult (although I think I've got all As in school!). My success is that I mostly maintained my weight (with a few pounds of fluctuation) and stayed fairly active. My goal for this round is to try to reset some of my good habits from round 7 and go back to losing weight. I need to push myself to make better food choices and get at least 30 minutes of exercise every day. And I want to try to be more active on 90DG again, which was a huge help to me when I lost 12 pounds in round seven. 

Anyway, that's a lot about me and I want to hear about you. This group is still fairly new, and will only continue to exist if people are interested in it. Get in here and let me know what you think! Tell me what topics you want to talk about over the course of this round and help your fellow students achieve their goals.

[Yesterday](http://redd.it/148qwe) we discussed diet, and if there are any questions remaining, please feel free to ask.  We love questions and feedback.

Today's topic is *exercise*.

---

Some general tips:

* You can lose weight without exercise, but it's going to be more difficult, slower, and you'll likely end up losing muscle in addition to fat.

* The better route for weight loss is to incorporate activities into your daily routines to *get you up and moving and using your muscles more than you did before*. Whatever level of activity you're at now, try ramping it up a bit. That might mean taking the stairs instead of the elevator or adding a walk after dinner. Or it might mean lifting heavier weights at the gym or running a bit faster on your next jog.
Our [Weekly Challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/146k6h/weekly_challenge_week_1_dec_37_2012/) are a great way to keep yourself moving throughout the day.

* *Track your progress*. It's too easy to get bored with your routines if you don't have a way to measure your progress. Even just keeping a paper log of your lifts can help you here. If you're going to be jogging, running, swimming, biking, ellipticalling, or any other cardio, try measuring your speed, distance, duration, or whatever other metric you'd like to use. After a few weeks go by, flip back to the start of your log so you can see how far you've come.

* *Push yourself*. If your chosen activities don't get your heart rate up, then you should probably add in something that's a little more challenging to you.

* Cardio is great, but *cardio plus weight lifting is* **much** *better*. There are lots of reasons to add weight lifting. The simplest is that you'll build or maintain muscle as you lose fat, which will prevent you from getting to a low weight with a high body fat percentage. Ladies: don't be afraid to lift heavy.  

* Some programs that everyone seems to love: [Couch to 5K](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) (to move from no running experience to being able to run a 5K), [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_Strength_Wiki), [StrongLifts 5x5.](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/) and the [100 push up program](http://www.hundredpushups.com/).

* *Don't be afraid of the gym*. Everybody had to start somewhere and everybody is focused on their own routines. Keep going back for more and you'll see some major transformations in your body.

* *Do something fun*. Go for a hike, play some basketball, go rafting, play tennis.

* Tip from andyleclair: ""If you don't have any equipment, but want to check out body weight training, [this post](http://nerdfitness.com/blog/2009/12/09/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/) on nerd fitness is a great place to start. It's a full circuit workout, and the only equipment needed is a gallon jug filled with water. There's also a nice video explaining the exercises"".

* Some free resources that one should at least skim through is the [r/fitness faq](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness) and the [brain over brawn ebook](http://brainoverbrawn.com/get-the-book/).

* Good sites to look up exercises include [ExRx](http://exrx.net/), [Bodybuilding.com (with many videos)](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/) and [workout-routine](http://www.workout-routine.com/workout-routines.html).

* If you haven't done so already, join [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/register/?invite_code=XF3Y2). It gives you a good overview on what your fellow 90DGers are doing.

So what are you up to today in the name of fitness? Doing anything interesting? Do you have any rituals that you perform at certain times of the day to prepare for the rest of it? Maybe packing lunch or preparing dinner for the week? Maybe you should start some of these habits. Can you think of any that would benefit you? Let us know!

It's a good day to be alive--that is my mantra right now.  Yesterday, my little brother was in a roll over accident but managed to escape with only scratches &amp; bruises.  Wear your seatbelts, people!  I don't even wanna think about what could have happened if he wasn't wearing his.  So basically...my family &amp; I are just thankful and relieved that everything is okay.

So..!  Let's talk about you.  We are Day 10, gals!  We have finally moved on into the double digits ;)  Give yourself a pat on the back!  How did you do yesterday on your goals?  Did you meet them?  Why or why not?

In an attempt to get off of the couch (bed?), boyfriend &amp; I have decided to do a few short workouts in the morning &amp; before bed.  I find that music helps my boredom during routines and am in need of some new material.  So I figured today was a good day to talk about: **Workout Music &amp; other distractions**.

My, personally, if I get on a treadmill--I am bored within 5 minutes UNLESS Im listening to some blood pumping music OR if there is something riveting on the tv in front of me.  Do you use music or videos or other types of background noise to compliment your workout?  Do you have any playlists, albums or music rec's for us? Im all ears for something that gets me into sweaty-mode lol.  I half considered books on tape but I think I'd end up slowing down &amp; getting a little too distracted with that one.

Get in here, women!  Let us know what's going on in your world!  I just want to tell you all how proud I am at the amount of activity we got going on right now.

Wellllllllllll...I ain't doin' so fabulous.  Woke up at 2am to a really crappy panic attack.  I hadn't had one in a few months so, despite stress, it was unexpected.  So Im kinda of jittery and nervous right now.  I had hoped I was over this.  Not exactly the bet way to start off my Monday but Im forging ahead!

Well gals, we are officially done with week 1!  How is everyone feeling so far??

Well, apparently loving myself isnt as easy as I'd like it to be.  However, its a work in progress.  And Im glad that I picked a goal for myself that is something of a challenge for me.  It's a daily battle so...one day at a time.

Alright girls--lets talk: **Inspirations**.  Since it's Monday, aka HELL, I thought today would be a good day for us to show and tell quotes, pictures, stories, videos.  Sometimes when we are in a rut, it helps to get a little inspiration going to get our day started.  &amp;so I'd like to offer my contribution:

[Ben Does Life: His 120lb Story](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SbXgQqbOoU)

I've shows this video nearly every round, that's how much I love it.  When Im feeling down and feeling discouraged, watching this video really helps put things into perspective for me.  It reminds me that, hey--there are people that have it worse than me and are doing something about it.  It reminds me that success is attainable &amp; to not give up so easily.  I also recommend checking out [Ben's Tumblr](http://bendoeslife.tumblr.com/) when you have a chance :)

To everyone that is still here:  Im proud of you.  
To everyone that is slipping up: Don't be discouraged!  We are struggling right along side w/ you &amp; are here to help.

1345030882.0,11,self.90daysgoal,y99he,[Weightlifting] Week 1 - Getting Started!,13,2,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/y99he/weightlifting_week_1_getting_started/,"Good morning everyone and welcome to our very first **Weightlifting** post. This is the first in a series of weekly posts where myself and **nanochic** will walk you through various weightlifting topics and discussions. The idea is that there will be a weekly topic/guiding question, but *anything* is on the table. If you have a random question, want to talk about progress on your routine, anything and everything - throw it in here!

Ladies: don't be afraid to lift heavy. There are fantastic benefits for both genders to be had from weightlifting, and there's no need to worry about getting ""bulky"", that doesn't happen overnight. Content is going to be structured to fit everyone, and where specific, we'll try to add in gender-specific topics when possible!

In addition to discussion topics, we also want to give everyone something actionable to work on for the week in what we're loosely calling weekly ""challenges"". We're structuring these so that anyone should be able to participate, regardless of whether you're a beginner or not. We'll talk about these later in the post, so let's get on with it!

--------

**Weekly Discussion Topic: Starter Programs**

Since it is our first week, what better to start with than starter programs. For anyone who is new to weightlifting, thinking about weightlifting, or has never followed a program before - the hardest part is often knowing where to start. Thankfully, there are a *ton* of great resources right here on Reddit, and across the web, to help you get started. We'll be talking about three programs in particular today. Before we get into that, some quick terminology. If something doesn't make sense here - let us know and we'll get it added.

* Repetition: A single complete movement of an exercise. Abbreviated as 'reps'. If you lift a barbell off the floor, and lower it back down, you've done 1 rep of a deadlift.
* Set: A 'set' of repetitions, anywhere from 1 to x (x = as many as you can do or as specified by a program). If you lift a barbell off the floor 5 times, and lower it back down, without pausing in between for a significant period of time, you've done 1 set (of 5 reps)
* 3x5: This is short hand for abbreviating sets X reps. You can imagine how exhausting it would get saying ""3 sets of five"" over and over, so this is abbreviated as 3x5.
* 1RM: Short for '1 rep max'. This is the most weight you can lift for 1 rep in any activity. 
* #RM: You'll see people talk about 3RMs, 5RMs, and sometimes others. If someone says ""Bro, my 3RM for bench is 200 lbs"" that means they can do a set of 3 repetitions with 200lbs for the bench.
* PB/PR: Personal Best / Personal Record. Used to identify new records. (""I just set a new squat PB today by 10 lbs!"")
* BW: Bodyweight. Commonly paired with numbers to indicate strength in a lift. Saying you have a 1.5xBW squat means you can squat 1.5 times your body weight.
* These can get ridiculous, but if this sentence makes sense to you now, you're on your way: ""I totally just hit a new PB today! Popped off a set of deadlifts at 1xBW for a new 5RM!""


***Starting Strength (aka SS)***

One of the more popular programs amongst /r/fitness and /r/weightroom, Starting Strength is a lifting program as well as a book that is designed around teaching basic lifting principles and linear, daily progression on 5 core lifts. Whether you follow the program or not, the book is *fantastic* for any new lifter, and can be purchased either in a hard copy or e-book version.

There is a strong focus on form (the program has people starting with just the bar to get form down first). There's also some variation available with the program, as found on the associated wiki, especially if power cleans are intimidating.

Program Basics:

* 3x/week program. Week 1: ABA, Week 2: BAB, repeat
* Day ""A"": Squats, Bench Press, Deadlift
* Day ""B"": Squats, Press, Power Clean
* Focuses on RAPID progression. Most lifts you will do 3 sets of 5 reps. You still start your first workout with a weight that is ""moderately challenging"" to you, and add 5 pounds to each lift when you successfully complete 3 sets of 5. This can get difficult quick, but for beginners it's a very fast way to make progress.

Resources:

* [Starting Strength Wiki](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:Introduction)
* [Buy the book on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-3rd-Mark-Rippetoe/dp/0982522738/ref=dp_ob_title_bk/189-7571169-3184244)

Bottom Line:

* Great, all around starter program. Teaches you a variety of extremely useful, functional, full body exercises.
* Lots of little details go into making this program, not just the exercise routine. I personally recommend anyone doing the program buys the book.


***Stronglifts (aka SL 5x5)***

Along with SS, Stronglifts 5x5 is another great and popular beginner program for new lifters. Unlike SS, Stronglifts is seen as more of a routine than complete program, and many on SL 5x5 still pick up the SS book for a reference.

The big differences between this program and SS, is that you do even more volume (5x5 instead of 3x5), and some lifts are moved around. Other than that, it's mostly the same.

Program Basics:

* 3x5/week program. Week 1: ABA, Week 2: BAB, repeat
* Day ""A"": Squats, Bench Press, Barbell Rows
* Day ""B"": Squats, Press, Deadlift

Resources:

* [Stronglifts Overview](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/)

Bottom Line:

* Another solid starter program, ideal if you don't want to try Power Cleans when starting out, as Rows are much easier.
* 5x5 is great to start, but it is common, and encouraged, to switch to a 3x5 scheme when the weights get heavier.


***New Rules of Lifting for Women (aka NRLFW)***

This is a comprehensive diet and exercise guide geared towards helping women find their way through the weight room, as well as eat properly.

Program Basics:

* NRLFW consists of seven stages. Each stages has alternating days, similar to SS and SL 5x5.
* Some of the stages has two exercises that alternate sets.
* Starts off with higher reps, lower sets. Gradually switches to lower reps, higher sets.

Resources:

* [New Rules of Lifting for Women](http://www.thenewrulesoflifting.com/nrol-for-women)

Bottom Line:

* Good starter program for women who might be hesitant to start lifting weights.
* Decent diet program. May have to adjust calories.
* Can take a while in the gym, due to required resting times and equipment requirements.


----------------------

**Weekly Challenge**

This week's challenge we're starting out simple:

* **If you're already on a lifting routine**, talk about it in the thread below. Let us know what your starter program was/is, what you liked/disliked about it, and what your plans are for your next program.
* **If you're not yet on a lifting routine**, take a look at the three programs above, or if you'd like to dig a little deeper, check out [this link](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/weightroom#StarterPrograms). Your challenge for this week is to find a solid routine to stick to for this first Sprint!

Pics inside as promised....,13,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/xk6d7/progress_fecks_round_7_results_round_8_goal_pics/,"Well it is finally over. I was looking over at nymeatball's detailed result post and had to take my time to write this all down. Rather now than later. I have put up my goals at my browser's starting page, so that I have to see them pretty often (iGoogle if you are interested). Here they are:

**Round 7 Results**

- Drink 2 bottles of water every (work)day

No problem here. Work days are my cleanest eating and drinking days. If it only were workdays I would be super strict.

- No more skipping Saturday workout 

Can't imagine me skipping even one this round.

- Not overdoing shit

Was a problem last round. I did too much and felt exhausted so I skipped the Challenges this time. Worked well.

- No overeating

The first month was a problem but I got my shit figured out later

- Getting more social

Not really. Some problems at home with my soon conceiving wife. It is a stressful time. Really have to focus more on getting out. Well when we figured out childcare with the next kid.

- Keto

I wish.....I failed so often. I have this sugar cravings sometimes. Right now in the break time it is even worse. Have to work on that one.

- Daily Scale

Hopped on the scale daily and it really helped.

- 90dg Activity

More or less. Next round probably not so much

- Month 1 Goal: 81 kg | Month 2 Goal: 80 kg | Month 3 Goal: 79 kg

Really sucked during M1. M2 was better and during M3 I caught my goal. I did it.....yeah.

- Progress Pics

That one helped me stay motivated. And I really do not like photos. I did some before starting round 1 ([here](http://i.imgur.com/YQcow.jpg) and [here](http://imgur.com/xqpSk)). After different rounds the progress pics still looked as if I have achieved nothing, mainly due to a shitty camera and me not knowing how to take at least medium quality pics. Thanks to a member and a new cam it is a bit better this time. I did flex though, although it is not much of a difference. [Biceps and in clothing](http://i.imgur.com/RLuHv.jpg), [from the side](http://i.imgur.com/z3Dtm.jpg) and [front](http://i.imgur.com/dBFFo.jpg).

I still have a bit of a flabby stomach that I am kind of self conscious about (same as with weight), but feel much better about it than before (especially in clothing). What I thought about those pics (that looked better than I was expecting) was ""I'd look better with more muscle mass.

**Round 8 Goals**

Thus my plans for the next round to gain a bit of muscle mass. How will I go about this. Here is something found via the fittit faq:

&gt;    If you are an athlete or highly active person currently attempting to lose body fat while preserving lean muscle mass, a daily intake of 1.5-2.2g/kg bodyweight (0.68-1g/lb bodyweight) would be a good target.

&gt;    If you are an athlete or highly active person, or you are attempting to lose body fat while preserving lean mass, then a daily intake of 1.0-1.5g/kg bodyweight (0.45-0.68g/lb bodyweight) would be a good target.

&gt;    If you are sedentary and not looking to change body composition much, a daily target of 0.8g/kg bodyweight (0.36g/lb bodyweight) and upwards would be a good target.

Being a vegetarian is tough. Having the added stress of a baby will add some stress. And even though I am in charge of cooking soon, it seems that will not help me much with getting enough protein (I will not prepare 2 meals, no time for that). So the plan is to go at it as good as I can and add some protein powder (sigh) to at least get 1.5g/kg. Depending on how stressful it will be as I might have to skip routines I will maybe have clean days and not clean days. Hard to tell in advance will try to stay at it though. The rest is business as usual. The last round my workout results, especially for the bench press stagnated. So I hope I can set some more PRs this time and have more workout (instead of weight loss) success. The big variable is kid #2, so if I would just be able to do my routine, it would almost be fine.

See you next round.

Today's topic is: **Diets**.  &amp;I am stealing from #4's intro post:

We have people following all kinds of diets here, so I'll try to keep this reasonably general. Here are a couple things that I've picked up over the last few rounds:

* Don't diet, change your eating habits. Figure out your weaknesses and try to tackle those this round. Do you eat a whole bag of candy before you realize it's gone? Do you have big weekend binges after a week of healthy eating? Does drinking make you eat more? Do you tend to eat late at night? Do you eat when you're bored/stressed/alone/with friends? Do salty snacks make you crave more salty things? Do sugary snacks make you crave more sugary things? Figure out your triggers and try to recognize your old habits before you fall into them.

* Listen to your body. Lots of people end up eating too little when they're trying to lose weight. If you're feeling drained or moody, it might be because you aren't giving your body enough fuel. That doesn't mean you should blindly start eating more though. No matter what diet you're following, I think it's useful for everyone to calculate their BMR and target calories for the weight loss rate they'd like to reach. (There's more info about this [here](http://90daysgoal.com/getting-started/food-and-diet) &amp; [here](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/).)Then, without changing your diet, try tracking everything that you eat, every day, for a week or so. MyFitnessPal, LiveStrong, LoseIt, or other similar sites should be pretty useful here. How close do you get to your target calories? If you're way below, add in some fruits and veggies and other small snacks to round out your day. If you're way over, maybe look for some alternatives to some of the biggest contributors.

* Don't deprive yourself, strive for moderation. Swearing off french fries or ice cream for the rest of your life is... mind boggling. I don't think I could do it. Eating enormous portions of fries and ice cream on a splurge day because you haven't had them in forever isn't a great idea either though. Work toward a middle road. Maybe allow yourself a small splurge once a month. Try to stick to a single serving and really savor it.

* You can lose weight and still drink alcohol. You'll have to be pretty good about it. Make some food compromises, watch what you're eating the rest of the day, aim for moderation, and savor every sip. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on alcohol might be an easy way to push through it.

* You can lose weight and still eat bread/pasta/potatoes/rice/sweets. Again, you'll just have to be good about it. Small servings of starchy/carby foods aren't going to derail your progress. But if your day consists of a bagel, a sandwich with potato chips, and pasta with a baked potato and a piece of pie, you might want to consider scaling back on the carbs and adding a lot of fruits and veggies. If you're struggling with a plateau, cutting back on carbs might be an easy way to push through it.

* A specific diet might work for lots of people, but that doesn't mean it will work for you. Try it out, see how you feel, see how your weight responds, gauge how hard it will be for you to keep it up long-term. If it doesn't seem to be working for you, try to figure out which part seems to be the problem.

* The end goal is a long-term, sustainable change to our eating habits. Quick weight loss has a pretty high relapse rate. If you're nearing your long-term weight goals, start setting out a maintenance plan for yourself. Don't let yourself slip back into old bad habits. Keep an eye on your weight. Set an alarm weight for yourself, probably 5-10 lbs above your long-term goal weight. If you ever go above that weight, it's time to re-examine your eating habits and make sure you're still following your maintenance plan.

* That being said, I would like to briefly touch on the topic of: *Eating Disorders*.  This was discussed in another post, but I feel that it bears repeating.  As a survivor &amp; struggler of an ED, I know first hand how difficult it is to transition into healthy eating habits.  What all of us want for you, as a a member of 90daysgoal, is to find your niche, to eat healthy.  I know that eating can cause anxiety and stress--especially when doing something new.  I urge to stray away from dangerous dieting that could become counter productive to your health and well-being.  As it says in the first bullet, try and figure out your triggers &amp; stay away from behavior that could spiral you back into old habits.  Please know that we are always here if you need a sounding board.  BUT please also know that we cannot replace the expertise of a trained professional like a couselor or therapist.

With that in mind, let's talk about you!  What is your diet/eating habit plans for this round?  Do you have any questions about any diet you are interested in?  Do you have any questions about a diet you are already following?  

Personally, I am doing Paleo (80/20) and have been since November.  I lost about 20 lbs.  It can be a little tough at times but as time goes along, it gets easier.  I think what has kept me in this diet longer than any other is that I've done my research.  &amp;I encourage you to do the same.

Now...!  Do you have any general dieting tips that you've picked up during your journey? Anything you've read or learned the hard way?

I also wanted to encourage our members to take part in a [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/exerciseprofile) by two graduate psychology students from University of Montreal and University of Quebec in Trois-Rivieres (one of whom has been an active 90er for the past two rounds).  This is an amazing research study about documenting the relationship between past exercise experience, motivation, intention, planning and the adoption of a regular physical activity habit.  Check it out!

During round one, I checked in here almost every day. I was doing physical therapy, and checking in kept me honest. I was very responsible, exercising and stretching as per my doctors' instructions. That lasted into round two, where those activities tapered off and my GP and I agreed that my shoulder was back to mostly normal function. I didn't really lose much weight, despite mostly trying to keep my calories down.

A month into this past round, my doctor put me on a lower carb/Paleo-like diet to help my weight loss so I could stop snoring and keeping my boyfriend awake at night. I love my boyfriend and want him to sleep, and I also want to lose weight (and have since I hit puberty lo these 20ish years ago). With my doctor's advice and my boyfriend's support, I completely revamped my diet. And my new eating habits gave me ridiculous success. So much success, in fact, that I felt so foolish for the way I'd been eating for so much of the past.

I was a vegetarian for 8 years, though I subsisted mostly on varieties of vegetables plus lots of noodles or bread. I started eating meat only after I had gallbladder surgery in August 2010. I've been on low calorie diets/lifestyle changes and undergoing periodic exercise and food self-makeovers every few months since 2006, with lapses due to discouragement. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't escape the 195-200 range. I had fought my way down to 189 but was always bobbing up back over the 190 divide when I talked to my doctor.

My doctor advised me that a.) I'm only 5'3"" (I've shrunk an inch since I was a teenager) and b.) I needed to get down to 163 in order to really make a dent in my overweight status, and the less heavy I was, the more likely my snoring would abate.

###

Starting weight, last round: **191**

BMI: 33.8

Ending weight, last round: **177.5**

BMI: 31.4

###

My goals for next round: start exercising again and achieve my 163 weight. Also, somehow become 3 inches taller. I'll let you know how that goes.

Method: sitting at my computer every night playing video games, eating vegetables and fruit nearly every meal.

Typical meals in a typical day:

 * Breakfast: tuna, two hard-boiled eggs, or steamed vegetables

 * Lunch: 10 raw baby carrots, 10 sugar snap peas, 1 ounce cheese, 1 serving deli meat

 * Snack: 1/4 cup mixture of sesame seeds and pumpkin seeds

 * Dinner: Eggs, grilled chicken, hamburger, turkey, pork roast, or other meats, accompanied by steamed broccoli, carrots, or other veggies

 * During vacation/from fast food places: grilled chicken salads without dressing and usually without cheese, Baja salad from Wendy's (with the side of chili)

Obstacles this round and last: none for eating, but a big one for motivation, and that is SWTOR, the latest MMO in which you get a Wookie and a baby Tauntaun and fly across the galaxy in your own Corellian freighter.

Let's talk about daily calorie and macro nutrient targets.  In order to successfully lose or gain weight, we need to set daily goals for much much we eat.

How did you decide how much you eat per day?  What are you protein/carb/fat ratios?

For me, I had decided that I'll be eating 30% below maintenance on non-lifting days, which is roughly 1600 kCal/day.  My macros are 50% protein, 35% fat and 15% carbs. 

How about you?

Princessbitchtits and I are going to do the Couch to 5k (C25K) running program this round. It would be even more motivating to have a big group doing it together.

C25K is a 9-week program that takes you from absolutely no running experience to being able to run 5km (3.11 mi) in 30 min. The program is laid out at [coolrunning.com](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml). You can measure your intervals in distance (laps around a track, gps) or time (stopwatch, podcasts). Here are some graphics that summarize the routine:

* [Visual C25K](http://tombenninger.com/files/2011/09/VisualC25K.v1_0.png)

Here are some resources to keep your attention on the road and not on your watch:

* [Robert Ullery's Podcast](http://c25k.com/podcasts.htm)
* [Podrunner Podcast](http://www.djsteveboy.com/1day25k.html)
* [Musicless Podcast](http://web.me.com/iestynx/Couch_to_5K/Podcast/Podcast.html)

There are also an awesome [C25K subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/c25k) and lots of other great resources at [C25K.com](http://c25k.com/).

If you don't think you're ready to start running, you could also try out the [Conservative Couch to 5K running program](http://www.beginnertriathlete.com/Programs/conservative_program.htm). This program starts by increasing your walking times and eases you into a 5km run over the course of 7 months.

***

I'll be starting Week 1, Day 1 on Monday morning:

* 5 min warm up walk
* 60 sec jog/run, 90 sec walk (repeat 8 times)
* 5 min cool down walk

I hope you'll run along with us tomorrow. If you have any questions about the program or running in general, please ask them here! 

If you've already started, where are you are in the program? How's it going for you so far? What resources are you using?

Some general tips:

* You can lose weight without exercise, but it's going to be more difficult, slower, and you'll likely end up losing muscle in addition to fat.

* The better route for weight loss is to incorporate activities into your daily routines to *get you up and moving and using your muscles more than you did before*. Whatever level of activity you're at now, try ramping it up a bit. That might mean taking the stairs instead of the elevator or adding a walk after dinner. Or it might mean lifting heavier weights at the gym or running a bit faster on your next jog.
Our [Daily Challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/obtba/daily_challenge_wednesday_january_11_2012/) are a great way to keep yourself moving throughout the day.

* *Track your progress*. It's too easy to get bored with your routines if you don't have a way to measure your progress. Even just keeping a paper log of your lifts can help you here. If you're going to be jogging, running, swimming, biking, ellipticalling, or any other cardio, try measuring your speed, distance, duration, or whatever other metric you'd like to use. After a few weeks go by, flip back to the start of your log so you can see how far you've come.

* *Push yourself*. If your chosen activities don't get your heart rate up, then you should probably add in something that's a little more challenging to you.

* Cardio is great, but *cardio plus weight lifting is* **much** *better*. There are lots of reasons to add weight lifting. The simplest is that you'll build or maintain muscle as you lose fat, which will prevent you from getting to a low weight with a high body fat percentage. Ladies: don't be afraid to lift heavy.

* Some programs that everyone seems to love: [Couch to 5K](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) (to move from no running experience to being able to run a 5K), [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_Strength_Wiki), [StrongLifts 5x5.](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/) and the [100 push up program](http://www.hundredpushups.com/).

* *Don't be afraid of the gym*. Everybody had to start somewhere and everybody is focused on their own routines. Keep going back for more and you'll see some major transformations in your body.  /r/Fitness's FAQ has [a good section on what to expect at the gym and proper etiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness#GymEtiquette).

* *Do something fun*. Go for a hike, play some basketball, go rafting.

* Tip from andyleclair: ""If you don't have any equipment, but want to check out body weight training, [this post](http://nerdfitness.com/blog/2009/12/09/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/) on nerd fitness is a great place to start. It's a full circuit workout, and the only equipment needed is a gallon jug filled with water. There's also a nice video explaining the exercises"".

* Some free resources that one should at least skim through is the [r/fitness faq](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness) and the [brain over brawn ebook](http://brainoverbrawn.com/get-the-book/).

* Good sites to look up exercises include [ExRx](http://exrx.net/), [Bodybuilding.com (with many videos)](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/) and [workout-routine](http://www.workout-routine.com/workout-routines.html).

* If you haven't done so already, join [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/register/?invite_code=XF3Y2). It gives you a good overview on what your fellow 90DGers are doing and will include [our new fitness challenges](http://redd.it/oba50).  Note that there are limited Fitocracy invites. If we run out, please tell the mods so we can get more.

some time to write this up here. Man even though I said goal in the title, goal is a little bit much for what I do. Look, in reality I am doing one round with 3 month report intervals, not gonna stop anytime soon, so my goal is  to stay more on focus and not be that sloppy.

And I was sloppy that round. I gained a bit (although might be a bit muscle here and there) and we do not have to talk about the stuff I eat....no no no no no. Besides that it was mostly a success. I injured my leg so I couldn't do that much, luckily I am on the road to heal. In the last round [I listed some accomplishment](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/ke6np/progress_4_results_5_goals/) let us see where I am now.

I couldn't do stuff like squats, running, reverse crunches and deadlifts that much due to my injury. I am beginning to run again and will finish c25k in 1-2 weeks. I have manual therapy in January and hopefully then heavy deadlifts and the other stuff will work, too. With the endurance stuff, now to be honest, I didn't really focus on that so there was no progress at all. I still can do 100 crunches or 40 bench dips, but push-ups kind of declined from 50 to 40, but again, I wasn't actually trying to improve here. What I did improve was the weight for 8 repetitions and that worked actually pretty well:

Bench Press x8: 54kg -&gt; 63kg

Chin-Ups / Pull-Ups: 8reps -&gt; 10reps

Dips (Triceps version) 8x: 29kg

Barbell Shoulder Press x2: 44kg -&gt; x8: 44kg

Pendlay Rows x8: 54kg -&gt; 60kg

Not bad at all. I got me the barbell bench press achievement on fitocracy and due to better equipment now (thanks santa) I am sure the dumbbell bench press achievement will follow very soon.

Other achievements: I stopped biting nails and I impregnated my wife.

So for the future I hope to heal properly and eat more consistently. Also, stop scratching so much (another one of my bad habits). A bit more focus, but staying on track. The numbers should improve and the weight shouldn't go up that much.

Life is a fickle mistress. Life should always come first but when it comes to dieting this is not a good thing. We celebrated last night with some steaks and sweet potatoes and a bottle of wine. I think it was a pretty healthy alternative to going out getting wasted or pigging out at some greasy joint. The most aggravating parts about this is how unexpected it was. 

How do you handle unexpected plans that fight with your diet? Do you roll with the punches and enjoy yourself? Do you portion control and eat only what you need? Do you find alternatives or maybe eat before hand? We all have to deal with these kind of situations from time to time and its fun to see how everyone handles it differently. 

What else are we up to today in the name of fitness? What is our goal today? I am going climbing tonight and going to be super light on my elbow.

There are certainly exceptions, but for the most part, people with a lot to lose have lived sedentary lifestyles.  This is certainly the case for me.  

When I make a decision to lose weight, I know that this means I'll most likely need to incorporate exercise into my life.  I get pumped up for it and excited.  I might purchase some new equipment or clothes.  Maybe I'll get a gym membership.  I generally can't wait to get started, and I jump in and over do it.  I then become frustrated because I'm in pain, have no stamina, and little to show in the way of results.  I then get frustrated at myself for having invested so much mentally, emotionally, and monetarily.  I look around, and the fitness community is filled with mostly beautiful people that can do in their sleep what burns me out.  I feel pathetic.  I feel like the outsider that maybe drove me to being overweight in the first place.

If this isn't you, then great!  Unfortunately, this has been me.  I now see that many of my thoughts has been a negative dialog resisting change.  My ego has identified itself as a fat person with all sorts of excuses for why I am fat.  My ego is reluctant to venture into the unknown, because in a way, I'm considering losing my identity and that is scary.

Psycho-babble aside, I think that it is important to remember that many of those who are adamant about fitness used to be fat just like us.  There are always the pricks, but we can ignore them.  There are so many more that are just like us - loving and embracing people.

What I need to remember is that this isn't a sprint.  I will see progress.  It is probably a waste of my money to join a gym when I can work at home on doing a few situps or pushups.  Simply walking up the stairs, parking far away, or taking a walk around the building at lunch time.  These are workouts for me.  If I keep at this small things, before I know it, I'll be doing bigger things.  Maybe then I'll need a gym membership.

Slow and steady wins the race.

I'd love to hear how other people are making small but meaningful changes in their lives.  I'm still too out of shape for the gym, but I'd love some variety at home.

Introduction and First Weekly Mini-Challenge",16,5,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/i4f6y/paleoketo_alright_folks_lets_get_this_party/,"Hi Paleo/Keto’ers! I’ve stepped up to lead and am excited to get things going after a disorganized first week.  I’ve eaten a ketogenic diet for 10+ years, and run a blog on low-budget keto cooking. So I guess you could say I'm keto-involved. In solidarity to the paleo folks on this team, for these 90 days I'll be eating paleo-keto Sunday through Thursday, and pseudo-paleo-keto diet on the weekends (allowing dairy and wine.)     

Each Monday I’ll post several mini-challenge options for the upcoming week.  You can pick one, post your own challenge, or sit the week out (please post and say that’s what you’re doing so I don't hound you with PMs.)  On Friday I’ll start a thread so we can check in on how the challenges we’ve chosen have been going.  We can also use this thread to brainstorm solutions to problems we’ve had – so we go into the weekend well prepared and re-motivated.     

I’m designing the weekly challenges to be things that will help us all stick with our diets and will make it easier to meet our goals.  Each week will have a theme (more on that later.)     

Weight loss, fitness, or general health updates are always more than welcome.  All I ask is that if you are posting something negative (frustration, plateaus, ‘cheating’, etc.) you find something positive to say as well.  I think it helps keep us all from getting too down on ourselves when things get tough.

***       
**THIS WEEK’S CHALLENGES: MAKING IT EASIER TO STICK WITH THE DIET**     
Pick *one* based on your situation.     

**If you share a pantry/fridge with non-dieters:**     
* Color code the food. Buy colored masking tape or stickers (red and green, for example) and spend an hour color coding everything in the pantry &amp; fridge according to whether its OK on your diet (green) or not (red).      
* Reorganize the pantry/kitchen so that all the items that are acceptable on your diet are in a specific area of the fridge or pantry (or preferably in a different cupboard entirely).       

**If you eat out a lot:**     
* Make a menu cheat sheet. Make a list of all the places in the area you like to eat out.  Look at their menus online and make a list of all the dishes you can eat there.  Keep this list in your wallet (and post it here to help others!)  Let us know if you get stumped by certain places (i.e. Chinese food, Sushi, etc.) and we can help.      

**If you are overwhelmed by shopping/reading nutrition labels:**     
* Make a complete shopping list before you go to the store.  Use a website like Peapod.com (or the equivalent online grocery shopping website in your area) to check all the nutrition labels &amp; ingredients at home before you even put the item in your cart … that way you don’t need to spend hours at the store wandering around reading nutrition labels and getting frustrated.

**If you never have time to cook or prepare meals:**     
* Spend one night this week preparing food in advance. Pick a meal that you could see yourself eating a lot (favorite meat, favorite toppings, favorite veggie on the side.) Spend a couple hours one night cooking up at least 8 servings.  (Or, if you don’t cook at all, just separating pre-cooked food into individual sized portions.)  Put in individual tupperwares and freeze so you’ll have them on hand in a pinch.  Most cooked keto and paleo food reheats very well.       

**If you’re a ‘snacker’:**     
* Buy or make at least 6 different types of quick snacks to have on hand. At least 3 of them should be shelf-stable (i.e. does not need to be refrigerated.)  One of them should be ‘sweet’ (cinnamon or cocoa roasted almonds, for example.)  One of them should be crunchy.

**The end of 3**

I have been silent for the last couple of weeks and wanted to give a short summary on what was going on. The last week of work before my holidays was really horrible. There is this customer and this huge project no one seems to completely understand it, so I am bombarded with requests that had to be done ""RIGHT NOW"". Thinking about my final day it was one of every programmers nightmares, lost source-code, manipulation of live systems, many customer modifications that had to be done on the fly and couldn't be tested, problems with different versions and so on and on. Given the fact that it was our biggest customer and that shit had to be done for 2 factories, I was really worried. I got it running at 18.30 (hooray for 10+h days) shortly before our network went down and before I could book my time / clean up some mess. So my first free day started with driving to work again and cleaning up that mess which luckily took me only 2 hours or so.

I felt kind of relieved (no angry calls in the morning) and had my holidays. From the workout perspective it wasn't bad, I took the pull-up bar with me and created my own little holiday training routine. I even had a nice run. Since I didn't finish w9d3 of c25k last time I tried before (had to walk for the last km or so) I had to give it another go and what can I say, running along the ""Ostsee"" really beats the suburbia in ""shithole"". So that was a good finish for c25k. Nutritionwise, well it are tough times for Vegetarians who want to do low carb atm. Try eating out everyday and you probably know what I mean, even worse, because of an EHEC infection going on here (I believe more than 1k infected, at least 10 already dead) it is not suggested to eat fresh vegetables at all, so no salad for me. All in all, nutrition wasn't that bad, when I look at portion size. The booze however, ooh the booze. I was drinking at the beach, during lunch, before training, during training etc...all in all I believe it got me about 2 additional kilos (not counting weight, so this is not the end of the world to me). Beside all that it was a nice holiday. We went to a theme park with Laura (twice) and she had a blast, drove with her first coaster, daddy had also a new [nice coaster](http://www.rcdb.com/4075.htm) he could try out, spend some nice days sitting at the beach **you know it** drinking which was pretty nice given the [scenery](http://imgur.com/lkUKx). We had some bad luck with the weather but we really enjoyed our week there. Still got a week left at home, slowly trying to get some stuff done (like taxes) and getting back on track training and nutrition wise.

**Results #3**

Well, I didn't really set a goal for #3 besides continuing with the training and running again. Also I really did stop taking measurements and just concentrating on my training goals, so there isn't that much to report. All in all it was a good round:

- I can now do 8 chin-ups in a row (5 pull-ups)

- 8 Push-ups with an additional 32kg (70.5lbs) weight

- Running the 5ks in less than 30 minutes

- Some visible ab muscles (the ones underneath the rib cage) still flabby stomach though

Looking back at where I started this is pretty amazing. I dug up some old photos. [This](http://imgur.com/wCLvp) is from Autumn 2008. I hit my highest weight after New Year's Eve of the same year at 115 kilos (I was obese back then). Lost some weight during 2009, fucked up my back in 2010 and joined round 1. Lost about 12 kilos then, got to normal weight in #2. It took me about 20 month to get from obese to normal. After that I switched from loosing weight to loosing bf%. This is me [now](http://imgur.com/kxHuJ). You can see the difference and that the shirt is still stretching a bit where my stomach is. My problem zone. All in all pretty good though.

**Goals for #4**

My goals are pretty unspectacular so no change compared with #3

- Keep up with my training plan (2 running days, 4 workout days, one break day)

- Keep up with doing low carb

- Stricter with booze, this one is going to be hard

- I wanted to start a running group, with a focus on timed runs

and hopefully by round 4 I will see less flabby midsection.

Btw, I also finished the novel Fross suggested to me (""The atrocity archives"") I have become a slow reader I guess, but really enjoyed the novel (working on the next one which is also apparently in the book)",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,self1,True,t3_hrs5a,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/hrs5a/round_3_results_and_round_4_goals_plus_my_last/,

We are getting sicker and sicker here as the days pass by. My lower back started hurting also so I am wearing a wool-bandage atm.

On top of that we had to get up really early (for people that do not sleep) because the painter will start today. So it is one of those days. Sick, sleep deprived, stress at work and at home.

I have started and stopped so many different diets over the years (Weight watchers, Medi-Fast, Atkins, etc...) and nothing has worked better overall for me than what I am doing right now.  Amazingly, all I'm doing is eating healthier and watching portion sizes.  I'm not ""counting calories"" per se, just using common sense.  Plus I'm on week 3 of the C25k Exercise program, with my 5k coming up on May 22!  I'm super excited, and find it hard to do the program only 3 days a week.  I feel like I want to do more!

You guys here at 90daysgoal have all played a big part in that, from helping me figure out what to eat, to helping me find the C25K program in the first place.  Plus I just ordered rollerblades and hope to get that started as well.  I have so much to thank you guys for.  As a father of a two year old with another on the way in June, it's hard to find the time/motivation to seriously commit to anything like this, but you have helped motivate me to find the time and commit the effort to finish what I've started.  

Here's why the other diets didn't work for me:  
Medi-Fast = Food way to bland and shitty tasting.  Lasted a month.
Weight Watchers = Tried to do it outside the groups, lacked motivation, plus I'm lazy, so counting points and keeping track was always an afterthought for me.
Atkins = Craved Carbs like a fiend.

My current diet is awesome.  Just use common sense.  I started at the beginning of the 90 days at 260, currently I'm at 243 (as of last check in yesterday).  I only weigh myself once a week because I've been down the road of everyday weighing, and it drives me to neurosis...  If I weigh higher than I did the day before, I dwell on it all day and it makes me grumpy.

Mkay, that will serve as your butt-kicking this week :)

So moving on to our stats. We had 192 people check in this week, with 174 people reporting their weight. Since there are so few people this week, and because I should be working right now, I'm going to do some abbreviated stats this week:

For the 174 people who weighed in this week, our total weight dropped from an initial 34558 lbs (15675 kg), to 34226 lbs (15525 kg) after week 1, to 33744 lbs (15306 kg) after week 2! **That's 482 lbs (219 kg) lost in the last week, and a total of 814 lbs (369 kg) lost since the start of Round 3!**

The average weight for those 174 90ers has gone from 198.6 lbs (90.1 kg) initially, to 196.7 lbs (89.2 kg) after week 1, to 193.9 lbs (88.0 kg) after week 2!

And just to be redundant, here are some not-so-pretty charts of the [total weight](http://i.imgur.com/A9IUD.png) and [average weight](http://i.imgur.com/hd3TQ.png) for the 174 90ers who weighed in. 

Congratulations everyone! You're doing great! Keep up with your new, healthy habits, and keep working toward your goals! 

Please remember that this is only week 2 and that weight is a noisy number! If you haven't started seeing the changes that you want, *do not give up*. Give yourself another week or so of hard work toward your new habits, and then start making some changes to your routines if you still aren't heading in the right direction. It can be as simple as cutting out one more can of coke or adding one more walk to your day. All that matters is that you're here and you're working toward your goals!

Yesterday and today have been up and down. I've been struggling the past few days with my insomnia and getting to the gym in the mornings.

My main form of exercise is cycling. I broke a spoke on my road bike and after taking it to the shop realized that my wheel set is pretty much screwed . Got a new wheel set but I was pretty upset about the cost and some other things, so I went running in the pouring rain when I got back.

I got hit by a car when I was on a training ride a few months ago and I broke a couple of ribs. The muscles are still giving me issues and I haven't been running recently. Before the car crash I was able to to 10 miles. I ran 6 yesterday and felt pretty great afterward. I'm feeling it today but it's not bad.

I drew up a training plan today that incorporates running into my cycling. I think I'm going balls-out biathlete at this point. I never thought I would.

I was hoping that by posting a list of the things I like to keep on hand to enhance and help me maintain my healthy eating, you might find some things you like that will make it easier for you, too!

Things that are low in calories and high in flavor:

* Mezzetta sliced hot pepper rings. Great on salads, in wraps or on home-made flatbread or tortilla pizza - 1/4 cup = 10 calories

* Dill pickles! I eat them whole as snacks, chop them up in tuna, or slice them on sandwiches. 1 large pickle = 15 calories

* Light balsamic vinaigrette. I love this on salads, wraps, for dipping veggies or for a marinade for fish or chicken. 2 tbsp = 45 calories

* Vanilla soy protein powder. I put a few tablespoons into my oatmeal or fruit smoothies to boost the protein in the meal. It also adds nice flavor and since I don't sweeten my oatmeal or smoothies, it makes for a much tastier meal! 1/2 scoop = 50 calories, 5g carbs, 7g protein.

Things that are great for substitutions:

* Greek 0% yogurt. I mix in a packet of dry ranch dressing mix with this to make nonfat, low-calorie ranch dip for veggies, or to smear on a wrap with some buffalo chicken. This is also great as an alternative to sour cream! Also great with some crushed pineapple in juice for breakfast. 1/2 Cup = 60 calories

* La Tortilla Factory Smart and Delicious Low Carb Wraps. I get the tomato basil. I use these for breakfast burritos, lunch wraps, quesadillas, or just as a bread on the side. They are filling, have fewer carbs than most bread, and have a good amount of protein and an amazing amount of fiber. 1 Large (10"") wrap = 100 calories, 20g carbs, 3g fat, 9g protein, 12g fiber!

* Thomas bagel thins, in ""everything"" flavor. These are just what they sound like. A thin bagel! A normal bagel has up to 400 calories in it. These bagel thins have just 100 calories. Great with whipped cream cheese for breakfast!

Items that are great for snacking:

* Mini Babybel Original Cheese Rounds. These little 1oz cheeses pack a huge amount of flavor and help satisfy my cheese craving with very little damage. 1 round = 60 calories

* Small, portable fruit. I'm loving the little clementines that are out in the boxes now. I throw three in my purse just in case I (or my toddler) get hungry on the go. One of those is sweet, juicy, and very satisfying. 1 clementine = 40 calories.

* Sugar-free Jello pudding snacks and Cool Whip Fat Free. These two are great individually, with fruit (strawberries dipped in either!), or here's one of my favorite things to do: mix one pudding snack with an equal amount of the Cool Whip Free and you've got about 6oz of fluffy chocolate mousse that comes in at an amazing 100 calories! That is my standby dessert.

That's all I've got for now. I hope some of you can find some inspiration in these items. Remember, go for flavor over quantity! It is so much easier to succeed in changing your eating habits if you still feel satisfied after your meal/snack.",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,silver3,True,t3_fzbdq,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/fzbdq/food_my_list_of_staples/,

All too often, when just doing ‘what feels right’, people have a tendency to under- or overshoot in favor of comfort or indulgence. Having a goal makes success concrete, and thereby more attainable.  

&gt;The point is this: no individual unit, repetition, set, calorie, or gram is or can
be the deal-breaker. But without one, you cannot have two, or three, or more. The
fact each of them counts so little is why each of them counts so much. What you really want is consistency. It’s not the one exercise or meal that provides success, it’s lining them up in a row that gets you there. What is a mile if not a series of steps?

No body is complaining about that :) but to make sure the sub-reddit appears clean to read we have some ideas.

Over a mod's lounge we have discussed about starting to use tagging for new posts. This way we can find posts we are looking for quickly and easily. So here are proposed tags:

**Anybody can use these**

* **[FOOD]** -To share what they eat, recipes or nutrition information

* **[EXERCISE] **- To share what workout they are doing

* **[QUESTION] **- To indicate that you have a question

* **[TIP]** - To share a tip or helpful website link

* **[MOTIVATION]** - To tag motivational posts

* **[PROGRESS]** - To share their progress and/or their goal

* **[COMMUNITY]** - To discuss the sub-reddit itself

* **[INTRO]** - To introduce themselves / initial post

* **[MISC]** - To throw a post which doesn't fit anywhere else

**Mods can use these**

* **[DAILYGOAL] **- To post daily goal and we have a rota system in between mods

* **[CHECK-IN]** - To request everybody to check-in their current progress

* **[TODO]** - To indicate important indicators of what to do

* **[STATS]** - To share the anonymous community stats


Please remember these are just guidelines and are not strict, so if you are wondering if your food question should go in food or question then stop wondering, just post in either. If I have missed anything or if you think a couple could be merged easily please let us know.

Well, I met ONE of my goals.  And that was to NOT eat bad.  I was actually having a very not good day.  And the first thought it my head was, ""Screw this damn diet.""  But then I thought about you guys.  And how I would be letting everyone down.  And how much I'd be letting myself down.  So instead, I made turkey hominy chili.

To be quite blunt, my butt is sore.  Those lunges yesterday morning are the culprit.  After work, I went to my work gym and found that the treadmill and elliptical were being monopolized by the clique-y ladies of the workplace.  So I lifted some weights and left to the high school track.  Except it was closed.  Argh!  So I went to the middle school and ran around their muddy football field for about 5 laps lol.  Dinner last night was sushi--I had half one one roll and half of another.  And I stayed away from the fried and spicy-mayo covered ones.  And it wasn't easy!  But I'm glad I did.

Tonight I think I'm taking it easy.  I will be busy after work decorating for our luncheon tomorrow.  I will try and get a few squats/lunges in after work.  And maybe some crunches.  Dinner will be turkey pita pockets w/ spinach, tomatoes and avocado. :)

1289920493.0,11,self.90daysgoal,e6zf6,[90dg] DAY 2 - What should I eat?,13,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/e6zf6/90dg_day_2_what_should_i_eat/,"If you’re already following a diet plan or you’re familiar with tracking calories, that is fantastic! For anyone who is still unsure how to start eating healthier, I hope this post will help out a bit.

**knioette’s awesome advice on dieting:**

You’re not expected to suddenly become uber healthy in one day. What's one of your vices? Pop? McDonald's? Waking up late? Not making breakfast? Not brushing your teeth before bed? Just pick *one* thing and start fixing it gradually! Once you you know you can stick to the new good habit, pick something else and work on that! Your new habits will accumulate over time, and you will start to be very aware if and when you break them.

If you eat McD's 20 times a week, try to cut back to maybe 10 times a week. It may not seem like a big deal, but you'll end up dropping some weight. Any small change you do towards a healthier living will lead to your body responding in kind. It is not the point to go on a crazy one-time diet, because even if you manage to stick to it all the way through (which is unlikely, because diets suck), you'll most likely revert back to the unhealthy lifestyle eventually. To make it work, take it slow and steady, and simply work on a building new, healthier lifestyle. Weight loss will be a side effect of embracing a healthier lifestyle.

Don't let yourself go hungry! Measure your portions and eat enough to feel satiated, not full. What’s the difference? If you feel you have space for a few more bites, you’re satiated. If you feel you’re about to explode and need to readjust your pants and belt, you’re full. The stomach, in its relaxed, near-empty form, can hold about 45ml (~1/5 cup). However, it can expand to hold 1L of food, or if you push it to the limits, you can get up to 2-3L of food in there ([source:wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach#Anatomy_of_the_Stomach)). It takes between 20-30 mins of the stomach being full to signal to the brain, which is why you should stop when satiated. If you wait for 15-20 more mins, the full signal should’ve made it to your brain. Another signal you can look out for is when you start pausing between bites. While eating, at some point you get distracted; you put your fork/spoon down, pause from eating, then resume. Don’t resume. When you pause, it’s actually a signal you’re done. When you resume, it’s because you’re subconsciously (or consciously) overcoming that ‘I’m done eating’ signal with the ‘eat your food, there are starving children in Africa’ signal that our parents drilled into us.  

**Figuring out a diet that will work for you**

So how should you structure your diet then? The following tips are from Tom Venuto’s [BFFM](http://www.burnthefat.com/), with a tiny bit of extra stuff here and there from knioette, Feckless, and me. (Again, I recommend that you buy BFFM or check it out from the library and read through it this 90 days. Venuto’s writing is much nicer than mine and he gives much more complete and convincing arguments for each point.)

* Don’t “diet”, **form lifelong habits**. The changes that you make over the next 90 days are changes that you want to keep for life. That means that you don’t stop your healthy eating habits when you reach your goal weight! Since you’re forming long-term habits, you should keep things that you like and avoid the things you don’t like. Don’t force yourself to choke something down just because it’s healthy. Be willing to compromise though! *Anything* is okay in moderation, so start by trimming back the things that you know are unhealthy for you. Also, try to add in fruits and veggies wherever possible. If you’re not a fan of veggies, take a walk through the vegetable aisles, and pick some random, weird looking vegetables and then google recipes involving them. Be adventurous. ;)

* **Keep your muscle mass**, also known as lean body mass (LBM). Muscle burns more Calories than fat. It also looks and feels nicer, since you’ll be toned and firm, rather than loose and mushy. Add strength training to cardio to maintain or increase your LBM while you’re losing fat. You can figure out what your lean body mass is by figuring out your body fat percentage, then subtracting the pounds of fat from your total weight. As an example, if 90dger A is 120 lbs, with 25% body fat, then she has 120 - (25% x 120) = 90 lbs LBM. If she loses 20 lbs, but her bf% stays at 25%, then her body fat is only 25 lbs, BUT her lean body mass also dropped to 75lbs! If you have two people at the same height and weight, but one has more muscle mass/less body fat, the other has less muscle mass/more body fat, who do you think will look better? Feel better? Have more energy? Remember that 1 pound of fat looks a lot bigger than one pound of muscle. To help maintain or increase your LBM, aim for slow weight loss and eat lots of protein. Try to get 0.5-1.0 g of protein per day per pound of lean body mass; and make up the rest of your Calories with (good) fats and carbs.

* Figure out your Calorie requirements to hit your target weight loss rate, and don’t drop below them. Aim for a **small Calorie deficit**. To figure out what your Calorie goal should be, first calculate your [basal metabolic rate (BMR)](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/). Now multiply this number by [a factor based on your daily activity level](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/harris-benedict-equation/). This gives you the Calories that you would need to consume to *maintain* your weight. Next, subtract 15-20% to create find Calorie target to reach 1-2 lbs of weight loss per week. For example, if 90dger B is 30 years old, 6’0” tall, and weighs 250 lbs, his BMR is 2334 Calories. If he’s sedentary, then his maintenance level is 2800 Calories. If he wants to lose 1-2 lbs per week, he should consume between 0.8x2800=2240 and 0.85x2800=2380 Cals. I think it’s important that everyone calculate their recommended Calories *now*. If you start off eating 2800 Calories or more a day, then suddenly cut back to 1800, you’ll trigger your body’s starvation response. It’s a bad idea and it will be hard to maintain. Instead, reduce your Calories gradually as you lose weight. If figuring out your target Calories for weight loss seems confusing (or boring), Livestrong will calculate your target Calories for you and will automatically update it as your weight changes.

* Don’t just diet, get out and **exercise**. It’s better to exercise to reach your caloric deficit, rather than to use diet alone. Your body responds to the stresses you give it. If you diet alone, you’re losing lean body mass in addition to body fat. If you exercise in addition to dieting, you force your body to burn mostly fat, while it tries to build muscle mass for your exercises. Cardio is very good for cardiovascular health, in addition to its extra Calorie burning capability. Weight lifting and resistance training are very good for making muscle.. and guess what? The more muscles you have on your body, the more Calories you burn throughout the day - muscle burns Calories, fat does not. Ladies, don’t fear the weights. You won’t get bulky. Yoga and stretching are also very important - stretch after each workout to prevent injuries. Chances are, if you’re lifting weight, you’re not hitting all the supporting/non showing muscles, which can lead to injuries down the road due to asymmetry (muscles work together, not alone). Yoga can fix that by hitting those muscles Men, don’t fear yoga. You sure as hell won’t get as little as women. Besides, why turn down some extra flexibility? ;)

* Don’t aim for “as low as possible.” Try to **actually hit your Calorie goal**. If you drop your Calories too low (more than about a 1000 Cals below maintenance), you’ll temporarily slow down your metabolism, break down your muscle mass, and feel sluggish and awful. Also, listen to your body. It’s not unlikely that your actual BMR is higher or lower than the calculated value. When you make any changes, pay attention to how your body responds.

* **Eat frequently and don’t skip meals.** This one is more for comfort. If you let yourself get very hungry before each  meal, you’ll be more likely to overeat. If it’s already natural for you to eat two meals a day without feeling hungry in between, then you’ll still be able to lose weight that way, as long as you don’t exceed your daily caloric intake. Small snacks throughout the day help you stay in control when you sit down to eat. If you tend to be hungry after dinner, *plan ahead*. The reason night snacking is usually a bad idea is that most people have already reached their Calorie goals by dinner. If you know that you like a snack most evenings, then make sure to leave room for it in your Calorie budget so that you’re still within your goals.

* If you’ve hit a plateau, *increasing* your Calories might be better than cutting them further. This is called “Calorie cycling” or the “zig-zag” method, and it’s mostly new to me. So here’s some homework for everyone (myself included): google “Calorie cycling” or “zig zag method” and see what you find out. Report back here with anything you learn. :)

* Lose weight **slowly and steadily** to decrease the risk of gaining it back. It took a long time to put the weight on, it’s not going to disappear in 90 days. Aim for a weight loss rate of about 1-2 lbs per week. You can lose more than that, but you’ll risk burning yourself out and eating away at your muscle mass. If you have more than 13-26 lbs to lose, I hope that you’ll stick around with us for Round 3.

**So what should I do today?**

I recommend that you sign up for an account on Livestrong and track everything you eat for a week before you start changing your habits. Make sure to set your calorie goals there, but ignore them while you’re getting started. Once you have a feel for how many Calories you eat in an average day, start targeting the biggest offenders.

1374753639.0,10,self.90daysgoal,1j0t9c,[Runners] - Week 2 - Training Plans,11,1,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1j0t9c/runners_week_2_training_plans/,"Good morning, runners!  I'm your other co-host of this thread, shell_shocked_today.  You may know from from other threads like Tasty Tuesday or Bodyweight.

How was last week?  Any solid races, cool new routes that were explored, great runs in sunny weather?  

A lot of us are increasing our mileage and training ourselves to run farther or faster, but how??  That’s what this week’s thread is about...  **Training Plans!**

Even if you’re not training for a race in particular, training plans can be really helpful in guiding you in the right direction.  It’s usually not advisable to increase your mileage more than 10-20% per week, because if you jump to too much too soon then your body might struggle to adjust.  You also should cut your milage back by about 20% every 4 weeks to give your body a chance to recover from the stress you’ve been putting on it.

Training plans are also nice because they tell you what to do - it’s easy to roll out of bed, check the training plan, and go do your X miles without having to think about it or plan it out and figure out what distances you should be running.  They provide a really solid schedule for you to follow as you work towards your goal - regardless of whether it’s a 5K or a marathon.

However, following a set training plan may not work for everyone - I’m not an expert and nowhere near a “fast” runner or anywhere close to a point where I need to do speedwork to help my training, so I’m not really sure about the speed-oriented training plans.  

There are **lots** of training plans available out on the ‘Net -- everything from C25K (and its many variants like Zombie 5k) to ultra marathon guides.  When you look at a training plan, you need to make sure you understand what level of runner its oriented to.  Is it aimed at a beginner, or someone who’s currently running 30+ miles per week.  You need to understand the goal of the plan, and make sure it aligns with your goals.  If your goal is to complete a 10k run, you probably don’t want to be looking at a plan that focuses on speed work.  

And most importantly, you need to make sure that it will work with your schedule.  When I was looking at training plans for my 10k, I was focusing on ones that had one long run per week, and nothing over 4 miles during the weekdays, because I do most of my running during lunch hour at work.  The best plan in the world is no good to you if you’re not going to be able to make it work for you!

And there’s nothing wrong with making your own training plan.  If you post it here, we’re happy to help you with it.  As well, there’s a weekly training thread Sunday on /r/running where you can have people critique your training plan.

Finally, just because  you are using a training plan, doesn't mean that you need to feel 'locked' into its schedule.  Its a guide and a tool to help you reach your goals.  If something unexpected happens and you aren't going to be able to make a run on a given day, you can work around that.  

So, what about you guys - **are you following a training plan**?  Any specific one (i.e. C25K) or is it a plan of your own?  How is the training going - do you like the plan you’re following, or are you not too crazy about it?  Do you feel like you are seeing improvements and making progress as you continue following it?",[Runners],False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,Runners,self9,True,t3_1j0t9c,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1j0t9c/runners_week_2_training_plans/,

What an event-filled week! So far, we've started the challenge, discussed diets and exercise, talked about progress pics and the sprints, and encouraged the community to talk. I am happy to see community-generated threads beyond the daily posts and weekly topics, and I hope that everyone is finding the community supportive, motivational, and worthwhile!

I like to try to come up with more introspective topics on Saturdays, but as always, you're welcome to discuss whatever you wish during the daily thread and just check in with your progress.

Today, I'd like to discuss **limitations**. Do you have an obstacle in your life that has historically kept you from your goals, or have you recently come up against such a thing?

Some of us have injuries or chronic physical limitations that keep us from using our bodies the way we want. My own body has a host of injuries that limit my exercises. I can't ride a bike anymore, can't run for very long, and have to modify weightlifting and pilates exercises.

Other 90daysgoal community members may have a road block in their lives that could be social, emotional, job-related, environmental.

How are you able to work around your limitations to meet your goals? Tell us about your journey and your plan, if you wish.

Have a great Saturday and rest of the weekend. Tomorrow is goal-setting, and Monday's the check-in for week 2. Let's do it!

How are you doing today?  How did your first week (or thereabouts) go?  Have you figured out what you're doing?  What do you have planned for today?  What's planned for tomorrow and the rest of the weekend?

First, I want to talk about the **sprints**.  You've probably seen the words ""Sprint 1, Sprint 2, Sprint 3"" thrown about.  We touched upon these in our advertising in other subreddits, but I'll briefly describe them again here for anyone who didn't see anything.

**What are Sprints?**

Don't worry, we're not going to make you run.  Several rounds ago we discovered that people were more likely to continue in the 90 days challenge if it was broken up into smaller segments.  These smaller segments are called ""sprints.""  As 90 is nicely divisible by 3, we made 3 sprints, each 30 days long with a 5 day break in-between.  This allows you guys to be able to really focus and go all out for 30 days and then take a short break in order to mentally and physically recover and recharge.

I also want to talk to you guys about **progress pictures**.

Some of you have already taken some pictures but if you haven't already, go ahead and take some.  Find a place with good lighting and wear something that shows off as much skin as possible (or as much skin as you are comfortable showing).  Typically guys are in boxers or boxer briefs and girls are in a bikini or a bra and panties.  Wearing lose clothing hides your body and while that might be what you want to do right now, it's not helpful for showing how much progress you've made.

You might not want to take pictures because they're a painful reminder of where you are right now.  Take them anyway.  In a month, you will probably be frustrated with a seemingly lack of progress.  However, chances are, you will have made a ton of progress but you just can see it because you've seen yourself in a mirror hundreds of times since you started.  Pictures are a great way to show ""hey, what I'm doing is actually working"" even when the scale doesn't budge or measurements go wonky (water weight is a fickle mistress).  Trust me, you might not be happy taking the pictures right now but they will be invaluable in the near future.

I think that's awesome!  The 90daysgoal subreddit seems to be just in line with the goals of the challenge!

I would ask that you don't share the PDF directly though, but rather share the signup link or the article itself:

Article Link

Signup Link
http://www.28dayhandstandchallenge.com

The reason being that people generally get a LOT more value out of the email series (it has an 80%+ open rate) than they do the book alone.  In the end, I can't force you to not share the PDF (and I would be grateful if you did that, as well), though I think that your readers would get a ton more value out of the newsletter and original article.

1369137786.0,11,self.90daysgoal,1erc62,[Runners] Week 9 - The Mental Side of Running,11,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1erc62/runners_week_9_the_mental_side_of_running/,"Have you ever thought to yourself, ""I wish I could run farther"" or ""I wish I could run faster""?  If so, you're in luck because today I'm doing a guest running post about **The Mental Side of Running**!

I think running is unique as a sport/exercise activity because it requires more mental toughness than other sports.  You can be as fit as you want, but if you don't have that mental side of it, running will be very difficult.  I'd like to give you some tips that I've picked up along the way, and I'd also like to hear your thoughts about this topic or share any additional tips you have!

* **Always decide on your distance before you start** - Don't let tired/sore you decide how long you will go in the middle of your run.  Because you will take the easy way out, or the short way home!  I always pick my distance and my route before I head out, and that way when I try to tell myself later that I should cut through the park, I have a counterargument for myself.

* **If you want to run farther, do it** - Obviously running is physical as well as mental and I don't want to suggest that you could go from running a mile to running 10 miles overnight.  But I do think you could go from a mile to 1.5 to 2 to 3... etc.  Just because 5 miles is the farthest you've run doesn't mean you can't run farther.  If you want to build up, just do it slowly, and then convince yourself that ""it's only a mile farther""

* **If you want to run faster, get a GPS watch** - Over the last few months I've been running slow, like a lot slower than I was in the fall, and I couldn't figure out why.  I could run ok in races and stuff, but not in my training runs.  Then, I decided to start paying more attention to my GPS watch pace.  And immediately cut 1.5-2 min/mile off my times (from 11:30 min/miles to 9:30-10 min/miles).  The difference is that when I didn't pay attention to the watch I was sure that I was running as fast as I could.  But when I'd look at the watch and say to myself ""I'd really like to be running faster"" I could speed up and realize that I was lying to myself when I thought I was running as fast as I could.  The watch helps keep you accountable to yourself.

* **Distract yourself or give yourself pep talks while running** - This may sound silly, and here's where I think people are really different, but during your run is where the mental stuff gets really important.  Some people listen to music to distract themselves.  Some people think through work or problems that they have.  I do a combination of stuff like singing in my head, having conversations or writing emails to people, planning out my running week or just my schedule for the week, etc.  Running is tough.  So you have to be tougher.  If you're constantly telling yourself that you're tired and need to stop and can't run anymore, you'll probably be right.  But if you've decided on your distance ahead of time and know you can run, don't talk yourself out of it.

So I don't know if this rambling made any sense to all of you, but I think running is a huge mental challenge.  And I love that about it.  :)   So lets hear about you, how's your training going?  What tips do you have for the mental challenges of running?  Or anything you guys want to talk about?",[Runners],False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,Runners,self5,True,t3_1erc62,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1erc62/runners_week_9_the_mental_side_of_running/,

I know that some of us have vacations coming up real fast and others have vacations in the not-too-distant future, which brings up the question: **do you continue your diet and exercise while on vacation**?  If you do, what are your tips and tricks to make sure you stay on track?  If you don't, do you try to ""be good""?  If so, what are some tips to help others do the same?

Sorry for the short post.  I'm going to be in a tiny room playing with a big electromagnetic for most of the day (thus, will not have access to my phone or computer).  I hope everyone has a wonderful day!

Finally past my belt test last night after 4 weeks of waiting and mixed schedules. So now I am a brown belt in Taekwondo. 9 months to train for my black belt. 

It brought up a good point though with all of that waiting I kept changing things to make sure I felt the best for the test. I did it for a few weeks and I managed to not be as ready as I would have liked for the test. Funny even with my good intentions I should have just trained like normal and just taken one rest day each time. 

So my question for today is do you do anything special to prepare or an activity? Does it change your training at all? Is there anything you are planning on doing that maybe you could prepare for a bit?

Otherwise how is your day? Doing anything fun in the name of fitness? Let us know! Also, as a reminder you don't need to answer all the questions I pose just think about them a bit because I think they are worth mulling over. Have a great day!

It's full of 11 vital nutrients and minerals essential for a well-balanced week. I hope you're enjoying your Saturday, or at least making it through to the next day!

Let's face it - we're hitting the end of our third week, and for many people, the third week of undertaking any new habit is when things either coalesce or fall apart. Are you achieving your goals, are you finding yourself playing catch-up, or are you letting your resolve slip?

* *If you're not doing so hot*, why do you think this is happening? Are other things happening in your life taking priority over your health and fitness goals for now? Are you not seeing results as quickly as you'd have liked, and is this lack of measurable success a bummer? Is your support system (besides this group of redditors cheering you on! PS You are awesome!) not really supportive, or is it nonexistent?

* *If your resolve is as strong as ever*, what do you think is driving you to succeed? Are your results coming quickly, or are you motivated by feeling better about yourself by making these changes? Are there any words of encouragement you can give to people who feel like they are about to give up (and I think we've all been in that position before... what has helped you stay on track in the past)?

If you're feeling lost, I hereby task you with making a 3-step action plan today to get your head back into your game. Make a note on your phone, write it down and stick it on the fridge, write it on the back of your hand, but remember why you started this journey and make that new commitment. Make one positive choice today, another on Sunday, and check in on Monday whether your weekly results are acceptable to you or disappointing to you. Reach out to the community here, and we'll support you and do as much as we can to help you effectively change your life. You're the only one who can act on your choices, but we all believe in our individual power over our own destinies. Each of us has our own journey and success story that we made ourselves. We can all do this.

Those who are on track - great job! Affirm your positive choices and any positive results, and share that joy with others.

Every one of us is amazing. Remember that!

I am very sorry if I convinced you it was not. Hey, free day!**

Good morning, everyone! Happy Wednesday, we're at the midpoint of yet another week and yet another sprint. Lets talk about **hobbies and disconnecting** - for almost everyone the regular day to day pace of life can be exhausting, and everyone needs a break every now and then.

How do you disconnect? Is your diet and exercise routine something that you  need to take a break from every few weeks? Or do you use your weekly long run, friday gym session, etc to disconnect and relax?

Personally I've found that aside from physical health - the biggest benefit of exercise is that mental and emotional release. Pretty much the moment I pick up a weight or lace up my running shoes, at least for a while, I throw out all the other stuff that's going on. That being said, everyone needs a break from spreadsheets for a day or two. I find myself getting disengaged once or twice every round, and then coming back more energized after a couple day 'break'.

Better to slow down a bit than burn out entirely - that's how it works for me. What about you? Have a great day today!

1365506379.0,11,self.90daysgoal,1bzeb2,[Runners] - Week 3 - Shoes!,11,0,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1bzeb2/runners_week_3_shoes/,"Good morning, all!  How did last week go in terms of running?  Anything awesome happen?  Congrats to our runners who CRUSHED their races this weekend, and best of luck to our runners with races in the approaching weekend!

This week’s topic is something that is plays an ENORMOUS role in running, and that is **running shoes**!!  They’re those things that you wear on your feet, and they have the potential to have a big impact on your running :)  [Sorry in advance for the wall of text...]

First, let’s talk about how your **foot strikes** the ground.  When running in sneakers, you typically use a *heel strike*, meaning that your heel is the first part of your foot to hit the ground and then roll towards the ball of your foot.  This is similar to how you walk - try taking a few steps and think about how your foot “rolls” from heel to toe, and that’s similar to how your foot hits the ground while running.  Another type of foot strike that some runners use is a *mid-foot strike*, where that initial pressure as you strike the ground is in the middle area of the foot.  There is a third type of foot strike, most often found in barefoot or minimalist running, is a *forefoot strike*, meaning that the ball of the foot is what hits the ground first.  This type of running also often applies to sprinters - next time you sprint, you might want to notice the difference between your foot strike for sprinting and for “regular” running.  With minimalist and barefoot running, a mid-foot strike is also fairly common.  

Now that we’ve talked about foot strike, let’s talk about **pronation**.  Pronation is the rotation of the foot while running, and is the body’s method of absorbing shock.  For someone with *neutral pronation*, their foot will initially strike on the outer side of the heel and roll towards the center of the body in order to distribute the weight evenly, and their knees usually stay in line over the big toe; this is natural and ideal.  For someone with *overpronation*, their foot will also initially strike on the lateral side of the heel, but as it rolls toward the center of the body it will roll too far and the weight will be distributed unevenly, and the knee will often track inward; overpronation causes shock to not be absorbed as well, and can result in problems with collapsing arches or ankles rolling inwards.  For someone with *underpronation*, their foot will also initially strike that same way, though the foot won’t roll far enough, distributing the weight unevenly and the knee may track towards the outside of the big toe; underpronation also causes shock to not be absorbed well, and the arches or ankles may not have much motion.

So, we’ve discussed foot strike and pronation, but what does this have anything to do with shoes?!  Well, shoes are often designed with these things in mind!  A lot of running shoes have cushioning or padding, especially in the heel (as opposed to the forefront) since that tends to be the area of the foot that pounds on the ground and have the most pressure on it.  *Minimalist shoes*, however, don’t have particularly much padding and are designed to be fairly close to being barefoot, but with protection for your feet from whatever you may encounter on your run.  For neutral runners, they usually just use *neutral shoes* with regular padding, which usually provides some arch support and shock absorption.  For mild to moderate pronators, as well as neutral runners, *stability shoes* are useful and help make the rolling of the foot a bit more stable.  For moderate to severe pronators, *motion control shoes* are designed to do just that, control the motion of the foot.  All of these shoes are designed with the intention of reducing the likelihood of injury.

How do you know what type of shoe is best for you?  I would suggest going to a running store and getting fitted - after being properly fitted at a specialty store, I discovered I mildly overpronate and need a bit of a wider shoe... I felt IMMENSELY better when running with the new shoes, which fall into that middle category of “stability”.  In fact, I love them so much that when I got new running shoes I wound up sticking with the same ones, and just upgraded to the new version :D

Now on to the **questions for this week**:

* How did you pick your shoes?  Were you fitted or did you chose them on your own?  How do you like them?
* Do you know what type you need, or do you know if you’re an overpronator, underpronator, or neutral pronator?
* Have you tried barefoot or minimalist running?  What was your experience with that?
* How often do you get a new pair of shoes?  Was it a difficult transition, or was it fairly smooth?  
* Any other shoe-related comments?

Apologies for the long post, but hopefully you guys find it informative and useful...  I certainly learned a lot while looking up the information to use for it!  Have a fantastic week, everyone!

Earlier this week, we [signed up](http://redd.it/1axwo7) for this round, discussed [diets](http://redd.it/1b0en0) and [exercises](http://redd.it/1b36ed), talked about the [groups](http://redd.it/1b68nr) within 90daysgoal, and brought up [weekends](http://redd.it/1b8qrl). Today, let's talk about **motivation**.

What's your motivation for changing your life? Are you concerned for your health? Do you want to improve the way you look? Are you training for a specific or aspirational event? Are you seeking to improve personal records in weightlifting or swimming?

What are ways you've been able to successfully motivate yourself? Are there things you've tried to use as motivation that haven't worked out so well (such as a smaller pair of jeans that sat untouched in the closet for 3 years)?

Do you find that group encouragement works, do you have just one main cheerleader in your life, or are you the only motivation you need?

I hope you are all aiming to stay healthy, get in a good head space and stay there, and give this round the best shot that you can. Keep in mind the joy of fine-tuning the human machine to the best of our ability. We only get one body, one mind, and one life, but we also get ceaseless opportunities to choose our destinies. I hope you find reason enough to continue to pursue health and happiness in whatever way you see fit.

How is everyone doing on this lovely Friday?  Hope you are all having a great first week here with us at 90 days goal!

We all know that diet is crucial when it comes to losing weight and that we need to “eat healthy”, but how can we put that into play with the choices we make and what foods we surround ourselves with?  One way is to be extremely mindful when **shopping at the grocery store**.  Here are a few tips:

* Don’t shop when hungry if possible.  If you’re starving when you go, everything will probably look delicious and you might end up grabbing things you wouldn’t otherwise buy (plus it will be a little easier on the wallet!)
* Make a list and stick to it.  If you have a pre-set list of what you need to buy, then you’ll be less likely to deviate from your healthy shopping list and you won’t forget anything that may be a staple of keeping you on a healthy diet (once, I forgot chicken... the grocery store was a bit of a trek, so I wound up eating just vegetables for dinner for three days and then ordering crappy take-out until I could get back there).
* Stick to the outside of the store - the outer perimeter usually has the freshest and healthiest ingredients... meat, veggies, fruits.  If the veggies you want aren’t looking so hot, you can always try frozen vegetables (but double check for any sauces that are added to the bag, because that can easily change the nutritional value of the veggies!)
* Check what’s on sale and in season before going - those will be cheaper, so if you know what is available and costs less ahead of time, you can plan out some meals for the week and buy your fresh groceries accordingly
* Planning meals in advance also helps with the grocery list - if you have set meals ahead of time then you know what you need!
* When buying an item off of the inner shelves, it often helps to check the nutrition labels.  Sometimes two different brands or two flavors of an item can vary, so if you don’t have a particular preference for one over the other, checking the label may help you decide.
* Also check the label for portion size - for example, one type of dressing may be 45 calories per serving, but how big is that serving?  Is it one tablespoon?  Two? Four? Quarter cup?  If you just check for calorie content but not serving size, you might be missing some information about how “healthy” it really is - it’s important to think about how much of it you are realistically going to use at a time.

Now that you’ve read the tips, do you think this info might help you next time you go food shopping?  Is this something you usually struggle with, or are there other factors that impact you more?  Let us know, and maybe we can help each other out :D

Second to last day!  How are you all doing?  Hanging in there?  Giving up early?  Was yesterday successful?  What's on tap for today?

Yesterday was good for me, rest day, so only ran 2 miles.  I also went to a reception and managed to not eat much there so I stayed under calories by eating something healthy when I got home.  Today I got up to go to the gym, but it was closed!  Stupid non-existant snowstorm..  So I ran 3 miles outside, in the rain, ugh.

So I'm sitting here at home (since gov is closed) watching The Biggest Loser thinking about how much I love this show.  It really inspires me to keep on track.  I always feel guilty if I eat while watch the show!  So what, besides this site obviously, inspires you?  Is it fitness blogs?  TV shows?  Books? 

In addition to the Biggest Loser, reading [Born to Run by Christopher McDougall](http://www.amazon.com/Born-Run-Hidden-Superathletes-Greatest/dp/0307279189/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362574760&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=born+to+run) made me really excited about running.  But there are tons of good resources out there, so let's share some with each other to help keep us honest over the break!

How did your week go?  Any fun weekend plans?  I’m taking a practice GRE tomorrow, though I wouldn’t exactly call that fun...

Going along with this Monday’s topic of body image, I think today’s topic will be **moments of confidence**.  We’re all working towards a goal, so maybe we’re not entirely content with our bodies all of the time... but who is?!  Even though we may not be 100% happy with our bodies every moment of every day, what is something that *makes* you happy with your body every now and then?  Maybe you feel super confident with your body when you wear a certain outfit, or maybe you feel confident and happy with yourself when you hit that certain distance/reps/etc. at the gym, or maybe you’re starting to notice certain features more as you make progress.  Regardless of what it is, let’s share **what makes us feel confident and happy with ourselves**.

I’ve found that I’m the most confident in my body after a long run - for me, there is so much satisfaction after running a bunch of miles and being able to tell myself “*I* did that, *I* carried my body weight over the distance and *I* didn’t stop, *my* body was capable of that feat”.  That usually ends up carrying over into how I feel about my body once I’m showered and dressed for the rest of my day, and it feels *good* to finally reach a point where I’m happy with myself.  Now, I’ll be honest that I still have a ton of days (multiple times per day, even) where I feel exactly the opposite, but I just keep reminding myself that **years of not liking the way I look won’t be reversed in a day, so I’m grateful for those moments where I feel confident**.

**So, let’s share** - what are those times when *you* feel confident?

Nox's skiing adventure made me think of a topic for today's post - **trying new/uncommon ways to exercise**.  Skiing is something that a lot of people don't get to do often, but it's an absolutely great workout.  Have you guys tried any new ways to exercise that you love, but unfortunately just aren't able to do too frequently?  Maybe for you it's swimming, or climbing, or snowboarding... for me, it's boxing/kickboxing - I love it and find bag training and doing drills with partners to be an excellent workout, but my student budget just doesn't allow me to go all that often.  So, how about you?

This is what I get for making the post before I look at the previous posts/surface for air from my insane work week long enough to pay attention!

Hey, everybody, and welcome to the very special holiday of Groundhog Day! Here in the U.S., it's a day when we all reflect on whether small mammals can really predict the weather, watch a Bill Murray movie, and participate in the Pennsylvania Polka.

Do you often feel like you're going through the motions and not going anywhere? Do your goals sometimes put you into existential crisis because you feel as though you're not making any progress?

How is your progress going so far this round - are you ahead of where you thought you'd be, falling behind, stuck in the same place? If nothing's happening, what do you think could pull you out of your rut - lapsing less, different exercise, different diet, more time to put toward your goal achievement?

Have a great rest of your Saturday.

What's your go-to brand?  What's your favorite pair of pants, shirts, bras, shoes, etc?  Do you tie/hold your hair back with anything?  Do you wear different things to different types of workouts, i.e. yoga versus weight lifting versus cardio?  Where have you found the best deal for workout clothes?  Is it cheap year-round (like Old Navy or Target) or are there sales to watch for (like Lululemon or Nike)?

I hope everyone's keeping up the pace and doing well!

Let's talk about exercise, weight, and getting older.  

##Those of you under 35 - *how are you planning on staying fit as you get older*?  

##Those of you that are 35+ - *what are you currently doing to stay fit and are you succeeding*?

A personal story - I was not the most athletic kid when I was young.  I had exercise-induced asthma, and my doctors recommended **no** physical exercise at all!  If I could go back in time, I'd give each of them a smack on the side of the head. :-)  My family also has a tendency to be a bit chunky, so that was a bad combination.  It wasn't until I turned 16 that I discovered girls and decided to get into shape.  I was in pretty good shape until I started grad school and working full-time, when I became skinny-fat.  

Fast forward to age 35 and I'm ""suddenly"" fat-fat, with little muscle mass and no cardio fitness.  I made the realization that I had better get into shape before I turn 40.  Thankfully I had long lunch breaks and spare cash, so I started working out with a trainer 3 days/week, and within a year I was in decent shape and down 25 lbs.  It was *hard*, and I now know that it would have been a hell of a lot easier to have stayed in shape the entire time.  *Much* easier.

Now that I'm closing in on 50, I know that I need to work out at least 5 days/week and watch what I eat.  Even over the past year, I got lax with my dieting and put on 10 lbs with little effort.  If I have one word of advice for the younger people on 90DG, it's **DON'T GET ACCUSTOMED TO HAVING A FAST METABOLISM**! :-)

***

Anyway, enough about me.  How are things with you?  Still motivated?  Slacking off?  Tell us what's going on.

Have fun!

How is everyone doing today?  What did you accomplish yesterday?  What's planned for today?  And, of course, what's planned for the weekend?

Now that we've got nearly a week under our belts, our exercise and diets figured out, and our goals set, I'm going to explain the **sprints** you've heard about.

A couple of rounds ago, we noticed that people were flagging after 30 days and a lot of them needed a physical and mental break.  Fortunately, 90 is easily divisible by 30, so we split the entire round into 3 sprints.  Each sprint is 30 days long and has a 5 day rest-period in-between.  That rest period can be used as a break or you can keep on doing what you're doing.

Sprint 1, which is what we're in now, runs from December 3 to January 1st.  Sprint 2 runs from January 7 to February 5.  Sprint 3 runs from February 11 to March 12 and the end of the 90 days.

One way you can utilize these sprints is to set smaller goals.  Some of you may have set weekly goals (or even daily ones) as well as overarching 90 day ones, but the sprints give you an opportunity to set a smaller, in-progress goal that is larger than weekly but smaller than the 90 days.

Conveniently, the Fitocracy Challenges run for the same length and during the same time as the sprints!  Go check them out!

What motivates you?  What's motivating you to undertake this journey?  Do you get motivated by pictures, stories, scale and non-scale victories, or quotes?  Perhaps multiple things motivate you.

One of the best ways to stick to your goals is to find motivation.  Are you doing this for yourself or others?  What life-long dream is pushing you to continue?  Is it going rock climbing or being able to run a half or full marathon (or even a 5K)?  Once you figure out what motivates you, write it down!

------

Welcome back for Round 9, Fitocrats! Whether you're a Fitocracy veteran or a new user - Group Challenges are back and we're hoping you'll join us for the first sprint, as well as the rest of the round! For those who were with us last round, the format is almost identical - there's a new competition this time around for **Heaviest Barbell Squat**.

------------------------------

**Q. What is Fitocracy?**

A. Fitocracy is a social site where you sign up and track your workouts. You 'level up' by completing workouts, quests, and challenges. These range from something fairly simple (Go for a jog of any length, perform a bench press) to the ridiculous (Squat twice your bodyweight for 20 reps, Run a 4 minute mile). 

**Q. Ok, got it! Now what are groups?**

A. Groups/Challenges are a way to get people together with similar interests, and compete against one another in specific activities. For example, the Running Distance challenge only keeps track of how much you've run, and ranks you against other group members. You're still allowed to log whatever you want daily, but only running will count.

**Q. You've got me excited - now how do I *WIN*?**

A. The primary intent of these challenges is to encourage everyone to be more active, but many of us enjoy the competition and you should take great pride in finishing high in (or even winning!) a specific challenge. The way the challenges are ranked is strictly by points. When you complete an activity, fitocracy will hand you out a certain amount of points. You get more points for 'harder' activities. Running 5 miles at a 8 minute pace will get you more points than a 10 minute pace, and running 10 miles will get you more points than running 5.

**Q. When does the first set of challenges start?**

A. Unlike past rounds where we delayed challenges a week, we're now lining up the first set of challenges exactly with our sprints. The first challenge will run for the entire length of Sprint 1, and starts on Monday, December 3rd. The first challenge ends on the last day of Sprint 1: Tuesday, January 1st.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to join a challenge**

1) If you haven't already, **join [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com)**. Back in the day people needed invites to join Fitocracy. This does not seem to be the case anymore, if however you run into problems and can not join / need an invite message one of the mods and we will help you.

2) **Follow the user [90DaysGoalBot](http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/90DaysGoalBot/)**. This means click on the link and hit the button on the top right that says ""FOLLOW"". (If it says ""UNFOLLOW"" you are already following that user). We have to do this as there is no other way for us to add you to the challenges. Also that is a user that every mod has access to so we can add you pretty fast.

3) Tell us which challenges you want to join. Do this via the comments here. We will need your Fitocracy Username to do this. Ideally it will look something like: **""Fitocracy:[User] Challenge: a,b,d""**. An mod will answer your request here once you have been invited.

4) Check your messages on [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/notifications/) and click the invitation link. Then in the group, click the top right button that says **""JOIN GROUP""**.

5) After joining, you have to join the challenge as well. Check the left side in the group for the **""JOIN CHALLENGE""** button. I can not stress this enough. *If you want to take part you have to do this before December 3rd*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How was yesterday? Did you reach your goals? What are your goals for today?

**Let's talk about how your week went and what you want to accomplish in the coming week.**

So far this week we've set goals, taken measurements, taken progress pictures, decided on our diet, started our fitness plans, and generally been completely awesome. Next week, it's time to get down to business and work towards those goals. How are you going to work out? How are you going to follow that diet? What about the week after that? **What's going to keep you motivated to keep going?**

I'm a very goal oriented person, so my motivation is almost driven by simply setting goals. Once I have a goal in mind, I have almost this compulsive need to accomplish it. In addition to that, I get so much motivation from all of you who are working towards the same goals I have. Seeing everyone discuss their routines and diets in the weekly threads makes me want to get out there and stick to mine. Peer pressure, if you will, but in a good way.

One other great form of motivation for me are the **Fitocracy Challenges** - I will be helping to run these this round, and they **Start Tomorrow**. If you haven't already signed up, today is your last chance to get in on the action from the start. Please read up on [this thread](http://redd.it/y6kso) and sign up today if you're interested! 

So, 90DG'ers, are you ready for tomorrow's check-in? I'm excited that we have so many of you participating. I can't wait to see each and every one of you reach your goals!

Today is day 5 of 90 Days Goal.  Can you believe that we've been doing this for almost a week?  It's probably been quite busy for everyone; we set up our exercise programs, talked about our goals, figured out our diets, and found groups to join.

Now, we want to know what you think.  Do you have any suggestions for us?  Do you need help setting goals?  Are you clear on what you're going to do for exercise or diet?  Are we moving you along too quickly or too slowly?  Did we skip a topic you want to know more about?  Let us know!

Also, we want you to know that if you want to submit a post, please feel free to do so!  We want you to feel comfortable if you need to ask others for help or have questions for the whole community.  

**What now?**

By now you've set your goals for the full 90 days, but we found that setting a few long, overarching goals can really tire people out and they lose motivation.  Everyone becomes mentally and physically exhausted without a break.  To help prevent that, we decided in implement ""sprints.""

**What are sprints?**

Sprints are short segments within the full 90 days.  Each of them last for 30 days, with a 5 day break in between each one.  This allows you to set smaller goals that you can achieve in 30 days that will get you closer to your big 90 days goal.  You can focus intensely on your goal for a short period of time and then take a short breather to help recover.  How you use the break periods is up to you!  You can keep on working through it or you can deload and scale back your exercising a little bit (not entirely, though!  We don't want you to stop).

**When are the sprints?**

* Sprint 1: Days 1-30 (Aug 13 - Sep 11)
* Recovery: 5 days (Sep 12 - Sep 16)
* Sprint 2: Days 31-60 (Sep 17 - Oct 16)
* Recovery: 5 days (Oct 17 - Oct 21)
* Sprint 3: Days 61-90 (Oct 22 - Nov 20)

This, of course, brings me to reminding you about the [Fitocracy Challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/y6kso/fitocracy_sprint_1_challenge_information_signups/)!  They, conveniently, last as long as each of the sprints!  If you don't have a [Fitocracy](https://www.fitocracy.com/) account, it's easy to sign up.  If, for some reason, you can't get one, let a mod know and we can invite you.

Please give us feedback on everything!  We like to know what we're doing well and what we need to improve!

All of that being said, how did you do yesterday?  Did you hit your goals or only some of them?  What do you have planned for today?  It's Friday, so for some, this will be a very challenging day with temptations and everything.  How do you plan on combating the weekend slump?

Here were my 90 days goals and my progress towards them.

* Run a half-marathon - **Goal Accomplished!**

Ran a half-marathon on May 27th!  I finished in 2:27, which was slower than I would have liked, but have signed up for a second one on September 15th.

* Run an average of 20 miles per week (260 over 90 days) - **Goal Accomplished!**

Ran a total of 297 miles since April 23rd, for an average of 21.2 mpw

* Run a 5k in under 25 min - **Goal Accomplished**

Ran a 25 min 5k during Sprint 1 or 2, can't remember the exact date!

* Eat ~25% of calories from protein (~120 g a day) - **Goal not accomplished**

I averaged closer to 17%.  Gonna try to work on this more in the next round.

* Lower body fat % - **Goal not accomplished**

I haven't measured it lately, but since I have gained a few pounds this round I am sure it hasn't gone down

* Start a lifting program - **Goal not accomplished** 

I have been lifting with a trainer off and on, but have not really done as much with this as I'd like, so I would consider this one a failure


As I'm going through my goals/results, I accomplished more this round than I thought!  It's good to put everything down on paper, because even if it feels like you haven't done as well as you'd like, you might still have made significant progress.  See you all in Round 8!  :)

1343821478.0,11,self.90daysgoal,xi2b2,[PROGRESS] Round 7 results,11,0,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/xi2b2/progress_round_7_results/,"Can't believe round 7 is over already! Looking forward to round 8 and a new set of challenges!

**Round 7 Recap**

TL;DR - Bulked for 80% of the round. Did mostly compound lifts (Squats, Bench, Deadlift, OHP)
on a linear program (3 sets X 5 reps). Started running last month of the round. Cut the last month of the round. Had middle of the road success across the board.


**Starting Stats**

* Weight: 167.8lbs
* BF%: ???
* Deadlift: 185 lbs / 84kg (5RM)
* Bench: 87 lbs / 40kg (5RM)
* Squat: 122 lbs / 55kg (5RM)
* OHP: 70 lbs / 32kg (5RM)
* Longest Run: n\a
* Best Mile Time: n\a

**Pre Round Goals**

My goals for R8 were, in hindsight, pretty damned ambitious. Putting these down for completeness/amusement:

* Weight: 186 lbs / 84kg
* Deadlift: 305 lbs / 138kg (+120)
* Bench: 135 lbs / 61kg (+48)
* Squat: 235 lbs / 107kg (+113)
* OHP: 115 lbs / 52kg (+45)

**Weight Lifting**

I had a couple issues with this during the round. The first issue was that I set my goals way too high. Every time I got under the bar I thought, ""Well, I need a new 5RM today otherwise I will be behind on my projected goal pace for this round"". Definitely the wrong way to go about it. I pushed myself too soon on some lifts, and sacrificed form for more weight. This, in all likelihood, led to issue #2.

My second issue was that I had a noticeable enough hip injury about 3 weeks into the round that it caused me to need to stop squats and deadlifts for a good 1 1/2 - 2 weeks. Nothing major - in the end I think it was a strained hip flexor or similar - but enough of a time off
to where I both A) wasn't progressing, and B) lost some noticeable strength during the time off. My guesstimate is that between the injury itself, and working back to my previous levels, this cost me a good 3-4 weeks of progress.

Thankfully, after that I started taking a lot better care of myself - a lot of ice (my new best friend) on particularly sore areas after workouts, and most importantly better form on all my lifts. 

Towards the end of the round I was able to hit a bodyweight squat, which I was happy with, and around the same time I just got sick of squatting. Currently I'm in a good spot with my lifts, and back to progressing linearly week to week on the other 3. Will definitely keep this going for the next round.

**Running**

Coinciding with the ""Squats, I hate you!"" mindset was the onset of a desire to start running. I have nothing to explain this with other than the chance for another personal challenge, and one of my co-workers telling me that we should do a triathlon. Well, I can't run, and I do
believe that's 1/3rd of the race, so...

At the end of the round I'm now done with the first 4 weeks of my running schedule. I'm doing a 3x/week MWF routine, paired with my 3x/week STTh lifting routine. So far it's worked well, and while I didn't have any actual goals for this round, so far I've been able to run several 5ks, a couple 5 mile runs, and most importantly, not injure myself yet. 

I will have some more quantifiable goals for the next round, but overall my plan with running for the rest of 2012 is to take it very, very slow. If I can make it through the next 5 months without injuring myself running 3x/week, I really don't care how slow or how little I run.

My very first run was in year old tennis shoes with an experienced runner, over a 3.25 mile (just over 5k) distance. Not the best idea. Since then, I've bought actual running shoes, shortened my stride a whole bunch, and am able to run comfortably for anywhere from 3-5 miles or 30-60 minutes without stopping. Lessons learned here? ICE, ICE, ICE. I ice my legs whether they hurt or not on nights after I run. Running shoes make a *huge* difference. 

**End of Round Stats/Goal Tracking**

Numbers wise, these don't look too pretty - but that withstanding I feel like I had a fairly successful round. 

* Weight: 184 lbs / 83kg (+16 lbs / 7kg) -- Goal reached!
* BF%: ??? -- Still not tracking this reliably at all...
* Deadlift: 213 lbs (+28lbs) -- Goal missed by 92 lbs
* Bench: 123 lbs (+36 lbs)  -- Goal missed by 12 lbs
* Squat: 188 lbs (+66 lbs) -- Goal missed by 47 lbs
* OHP: 88lbs (+18 lbs) -- Goal missed by 37 lbs
* Longest Run: 5.2 miles  / 8.4km
* Best Mile Time: 9:00

Initial goals might have been a touch high. Considering getting injured, the important thing is I still progressed some. Could have been more, but that's what R8 is for!

**Final Thoughts**

* I write too much.
* Having to work your way back up from an injury is way more frustrating than progressing slowly.
* You *can* lift and run at the same time, and make progress on both. You may have to decide to
sacrifice a little bit in either area. I chose to sacrifice a bit on squats.
* Ice is literally the best thing ever. 

I doubt anyone has questions, but if you do, I'd be happy to answer them. See you in round 8!

Back pain, ahoy!  I'm working through some not nice pains this morning but am just trying to work through it.

How did everyone do over the weekend?  Did you meet your goals?

The weekend was a wash for me.  It's...always kinda been a wash.  I've been with 90dg since Round I and one of my ongoing issues is trying to maintain my healthy outlook over the weekend.  It's hard.  It continues to be a challenge for me.  So yeah.

Let's talk **motivation**.  All of us here come from very different walks of life.  Each of us have our own reasons for being here.  What is your motivation?  What helps get you into your best mindset?  

Mine is shallow but I dont give a damn : I wanna look great in a bikini.  Summer is coming up...well, in South Texas it's kind of already here.  I'm 3 lbs away from the goal weight I made for myself over a YEAR ago.  Yes, my progress has been...slow.  But now that Im close, I want to tone and well...strut, damnit!

I'm just curious if this is something that happens to other people as well. Whenever I'm making a change in my diet/life style (which happens quite often as I always eventually go back to a ""normal"" more sedentary chocolate filled lifestyle) I get some really weird dreams. 

There are two types; in one I dream about my past as a dancer (I have a degree in contemporary ballet). I dream either that I am in really good shape again and that I'm flexible and strong and dancing, only to wake up and realise that that's not my life anymore.. or I dream that I'm watching others dance and that I can't participate myself (I stopped partly because of chronic back pain, so standing on the sideline watching was something I often had to do, which felt like torture). When I just stopped dancing I had these dreams at random times, and quite often. Now I only get them when I start a good exercise regime and get a healthy diet...

The other kind of dream I get is that I cheat on my diet. And these dreams are sooooo realistic. I'll dream that I eat cakes and chocolate or something, and then I realise that I shouldn't have and feel really guilty about it. One time I actually thought I had done it even after I woke up, and it wasn't until later that day when I tried to remember more about how or why or when I overindulged that I realised I had only dreamed it. When I started this challenge I dreamed that I ate a huge cake sized piece of some kind of chocolate dessert that I was supposed to bring to a potluck or something... and then I ate a chocolate ice cream. And I ate the ice cream by biting chunks off, not licking or nibbling or anything, just eating it as if it was a hamburger.. 

It's just really weird, because I never dream these things except when trying to make healthy lifestyle changes.

Do any of you have dreams similar to mine?

**TL;DR** Whenever I start a healthy diet and exercise regime I get dreams of either binging on chocolate or similar, or of me being in really good shape (like I used to be when I was taking my dance degree). Does this also happens to other people?",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,self7,True,t3_t422p,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/t422p/anyone_else_who_gets_fitnessdiet_related_dreams/,

Obviously Im having a case of ""I dont want to get up early""-itis.  So bear with me lol.  Let's get today started with a motivational quote:

&gt; You have to stay in shape. My grandmother, she started walking five miles a day when she was 60. She’s 97 today and we don’t know where the hell she is. – Ellen Degeneres

I wanted to keep it light this morning.  Fitness doesn't always have to be this rigid, serious structure.  Sometimes it can be fun and enjoyable.  And I think that gets forgotten sometimes.  Sometimes I exercise in the gym and sometimes its at home--dancing with the radio while I clean lol.  I think the most important thing is that you are actually commiting to an activity.  That is a great achievement.

Well, women--we are one week down &amp; its the last day of the month.  How did you do over the weekend?  Did you meet your goals?  How about today?  What is your plan to getting this day started on the right foot?

Going for a run after work.  General weight fluctuation is getting me down.  Realistically, I know that it happens.  But damn, if it isnt annoying!

* Push-ups (you can never do enough push-ups)
* [Flutter kicks](http://i.imgur.com/1kbti.png)
* [Lunges](http://www.abc-of-fitness.com/training-own-body-weight/lunges.asp)

Try to do at least three sets of each and report on your progress as you go.  And if you can only do 1 or 2 reps, it's a great start!  You'll get better as you practice and build strength.

For this weekend, your challenge is to reflect upon the first week of the round and think about:

* *Your level of commitment* - what can you do to get yourself into the headspace that you'll be involved on a daily basis and stay committed to your goals?  If not daily, how often is enough/too little?
* *Your goals* - are you being too easy/too hard on yourself with your current goals?
* *Your plan* - have you thought through exactly *how* you're going to reach your goals?


As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Have fun,

[Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com) is a popular workout tracker that turns exercise into a game. As you log your routines, you gain experience points, complete quests, earn achievements, and level up. More importantly for us, it offers groups and challenge which really help to keep the motivation going.

Speaking of the challenges, [last round](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/s56ly/fitocracy_end_results/) we had a good run with our challenges. People almost did 45.000 push-ups and ran more than 1.500 miles. Overall it was a great success and really pushed people to their limits. This round we will have challenges for each sprint which means the challenges for this sprint start next week on the **4th of May** and will end on the 22nd. So if you want to take part in **you have to join till the 4th of May, or you can only watch from the sidelines**. There will be several reminders over the next week and hopefully many people join. Depending on the outcome, we will have different challenges next sprint and might even play around with sub-groups (a free 4 all challenge for beginner or a Bench Press challenge for women come to mind), but this all depends on the participation and interest here. So for this round we offer the following challenges (please note that you can follow the links only if you were invited to the group, but we will get there in a second):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Challenges Sprint 1 / 4th - 22nd of May**

a) **[R7: Heaviest Deadlift Challenge](http://www.fitocracy.com/group/8765/)**
 - Exercise: Barbell Deadlift

b) **[R7: Heaviest Bench Press Challenge](http://www.fitocracy.com/group/8766/)**
 - Exercise: Barbell Bench Press

c) **[R7: Running Distance Challenge](http://www.fitocracy.com/group/8767/)**
 - Exercise: Running (no Treadmill)

d) **[R7: Cycling Distance Challenge](http://www.fitocracy.com/group/8771/)**
 - Exercise: Cycling (including stationary), Spinning

e) **[R7: Basics Challenge](http://www.fitocracy.com/group/8773/)**
 - Exercises: Push-ups, Pull-ups, Sit-ups, Crunches, Running (no Treadmill)

f) **[R7: Free 4 All Challenge](http://www.fitocracy.com/group/8772/)**
 - Exercise: Anything goes

Please note that we do not have the power to modify the exercises of the different challenges as those are set by the Fitocracy admins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last round we had public challenges which means that any other user on Fitocracy was able to join. We voted on that one and it was decided that this round the challenges stay private, which means, we mods have to invite you to the challenges, which means a little bit more work for you, but I am sure it just requires a few minutes of your time to join. What now follows is a detailed description of steps necessary for you to join the challenges:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to join a challenge**

1) If you haven't already, **join [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com)**. Back in the days (last round) people needed invites to join Fitocracy. This does not seem to be the case anymore, if however you run into problems and can not join / need an invite message one of the mods and we will help you.

2) **Follow the user [90DaysGoalBot](http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/90DaysGoalBot/)**. This means click on the link and hit the button on the top right that says ""FOLLOW"". (If it says ""UNFOLLOW"" you are already following that user). We have to do this as there is no other way for us to add you to the challenges. Also that is a user that every mod has access to so we can add you pretty fast.

3) Tell us which challenges you want to join. Do this via the comments here. We will need your Fitocracy Username to do this. Ideally it will look something like: **""Fitocracy:[User] Challenge: a,b,d""**. An mod will answer your request here once you have been invited.

4) Check your messages on [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/notifications/) and click the invitation link. Then in the group, click the top right button that says **""JOIN GROUP""**.

5) After joining, you have to join the challenge as well. Check the left side in the group for the **""JOIN CHALLENGE""** button. I can not stress this enough. **If you want to take part you have to do this before May 4th**.

I wasn't expecting much. However, the results were good.

Final stats put me around 6'5"" tall (195cm) and 177 pounds (80.5KG). A BMI of 21 from 22.5. I'm not huge on using BMI since it doesn't work great for tall people, but it's a standard. I'm not sure what my final body fat percentage is because I don't have any calipers handy. I plan on doing a measurement before the start of the next 90Days.


I started the 90Days by doing about 45 days of Paleo + Beer. It helped me break through a plateau at about 190 pounds where I have been stuck for a year. In all I lost about thirteen pounds, but may have gained back two or so in the last couple of weeks. And by +Beer I mean I drank on average 2 beers per evening for the entire 90 days. I'm a beer geek, it's not something I'm going to give up.

Measurements did not change much. Biceps, calves, neck, thighs and forearms had nearly zero change. Hips, waist and chest were a decent change at about -2.5"" throughout. I can do about 15 more pushups than I could in the beginning, but that's not saying much.

Exercises consisted of daily bicycle commuting to work (~10 miles round trip) and some dumbbell exercises. I really need to figure out how to do more weights so I can pack on some muscle, though I have little to no interest in joining a gym.

Next round I am going to see if I can do C25K along with cycling, and figure out how to get some weights involved. My goals for next round are just tone up some body fat and increase strength.

What's everyone up to this weekend? Any goals or plans?

**Let's talk about drinking, given that it's St. Paddy's Day.**

Aside from getting shitfaced, the downfall of alcohol comes in the calories consumed with each drink. Liquers and mixes add up, so let's dissect them, shall we!

[Chart of calories in alcohol](http://getdrunknotfat.com/)

Above is a list of pretty much every booze out there and it's caloric content. As you can see, hard liquor has the least, liquers the most, and beer and wine falls in between. Add on mixes like pop and juice and you've got yourself some sugary, calorie bombs in your hand.

So, what can we do about it? By choosing a hard alcohol like vodka, and a diet mix like sprite zero, or sugar free red bull, you bring the calories down by a staggering amount.

Let's hear your favorite drinks and what you can do to make it a bit less damaging to your waistline!

Have a great day everyone and be safe, even if you're getting wasteypants!

So I finally joined the world of smart phones and I was looking for some apps for my android. I decided it would also be a good thing to talk about today. Does anyone use any apps currently to track their fitness or nutrition? How have they worked for you?

I personally have had no way to track my workouts and nutrition by phone until now. So I am curious to see how other people like it and what they use. Its pretty well known that keeping track of things like calories and workouts can help you stay on track and help you make better decisions. Nutrition benefits greatly when you know you cant afford that cupcake compared to guessing. Exercise is so much easier when you know exactly how much weight you lifted yesterday and how you felt doing it. If you dont currently use any apps I might suggest giving it a try. You never know what you might like. Specifically in the /r/fitness faq there are some apps you can look into. 

What are your goals today? Any big plans in the name of fitness? I have some weight lifting over lunch but thats about it. Good Luck everyone!

e.g.

* [5 \* PAELO] (for somebody joining in fifth round)

 .2. Does having team names in tag any use? What else we can use this space for? One suggestion is to display current status of goal.

My eating habits aren't the greatest...I got some bad news over the weekend about my Grandmama so I guess you can say I ate my feelings.  BUT!  Im back on the pony.

Personally, I use MyFitnessPal.  I'm not exactly...diligent with it but it gets the job done.  It has a wide variety of food so if I need to check calories on something, I can do it in a jiff--especially because I have an Android app for it.  Cons?  My main gripe is that to put it on the exercises Ive done is rather time consuming.  In crossfit we are constantly doing a bunch of routines so it can get tedious.  Now it's your turn!  Let us know what you use.

Beyond that, let us know what your daily goal is for today!  &amp;as always, support your fellow 90ers :)

My past obstacles were abuse as a child, bad relationships, poor self-esteem, grief from losing a sibling, depression, quitting smoking, childbirth, being a new mother, and an injury or two. Now, the only obstacle in my way is my own laziness! I will overcome my obstacles, and so will you!

The basics are that Twitter users register for the 5K, complete 3.1 miles by foot at any time of the day, at whatever pace, and register their time results by midnight.

It's not a 5K done for any reason except that of being healthier and pushing ourselves. The blogger invites us to think about why we run (or walk, like me), or why we exercise in the first place.

Try to do at least 3 sets of each.  Report your progress as you do each set.

In addition, I have a special weekend challenge for you.  The challenge is to **avoid all refined food**.  No refined flour, no refined sugars.  Keep it ""whole"" all weekend!  

*NOTE*: If you have a cheat day this weekend, ignore this challenge for that day and eat all of the crap you want.  Everyone else, be good. :-)

I'm sore &amp; Im in a good mood.  I went to Crossfit this morning (6am!) &amp; already completed my WODs for the day.  Even if I HATE waking up so early, it sure is a relief to have that out of the way.  Last night I made pizza bowls!  Basically, I make a pizza in a ramekin (sans crust!) and it is fab!

As the round progresses, you may notice that WLW &amp; YDG might have the same discussion topics at different times.  So please..!  If you have any ideas for future discussions, I am all ears.

Today I'd like to talk about: **Motivations**.  Each of us are here for our own unique reasons.  Some of us have weddings coming up, some are trying to concieve, others just want that beach bod--and the motivational lists goes on &amp; on.  I want you to take a moment &amp; think about the real reason why you joined 90dg.  Share with us &amp; discuss it with others.  I even would like to encourage you to write it down.  Why?  Because there are some days--and we all have them--where we feel low or feel discouraged.  &amp;seeing your motivational visually is a wonderful reminder of why you made your way here.  So lets take a moment and chit chat!

Well...I have several reasons.  One of them being that after the death of an ex, I gained 20lbs.  This body that Im in?  It's not mine.  I just want to go back to where I was.  I want to be healthy.  Im tired of binge eating.  Im tired of crying when I look in the mirror.  Im tired of trying on clothes that don't fit.  Another reason is that mentally...I am easily depressed.  I think being proud of my accomplishments would be good for my self esteem and of course my well being.  Lest we forget that I want to wear a bikini PROUDLY this year...!

Don't forget: Connect with your 90dg fellows on [IRC](http://redd.it/g14gc) or [IM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsOUFG-d9pcodG1LVnc2dHlfelVvQjMwd3pDRG9wS1E), find a [buddy](http://redd.it/o4feo), join us on [fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/group/17/).

Mine was pretty painful. Where I live, we get these weather shifts called Chinooks. When they come in and out, it's pretty damn sudden and it's generally migraine inducing for our population. I am no exception, so I woke up wanting to skewer my brain. I put off my training until the afternoon, but I went! I also did my yoga and meditation and did pretty well with my eating. Hooray!

So, let's talk about **myths, broscience, and ""helpful advice""**.

Frequently, when people find out I lift weights and my goal is to do Olympic lifting, they say ""OMG you're going to look like a man!"", ""your muscles are going to look gross"", ""you're going to lose your breasts"" and so much more.

You will NOT get ""bulky"" lifting weights unless you do it as a career and supplement with steroids. Period. End of story!

Sup daily goal individuals. Now if we are honest with ourselves each one of us throughout the week will have moments of weakness. Psychologically dieting and sticking to our goals is difficult. It requires us to be on our game and make decisions consistently. So lets mention something about our weaknesses. As a group we can certainly help each other find our weaknesses and propose solutions.

Personally there is a small amount of time between lunch and dinner when I am sitting at my desk alone and often hungry. I have a hard time not going to get a snack from the vending machine or a candy bar from whatever kid is playing a sport at the current time. This is the hardest time for me not to eat extra calories or food that isn’t quite as clean. I have tried a few things but somehow my desire to eat something unhealthy and especially because no one around me cares about what I eat I have a hard time sticking to healthy alternatives. I have tried sunflower seeds and having a protein shake and just sucking it up but I still sink back to wanting some carbs or a candy bar. 

While our weaknesses are not our favorite things to think about a diet can only be as good as the bottom line. Pick up the bottom line and you will be able to see more progress in a week. So lets hear em.

ALSO IMPORTANT PLEASE REMEMBER TO CHECK IN IF YOU HAVENT DONE SO ALREADY. This is for our stats and to help keep your statistics tracked with us.

I don't think it's water fluctuations, those seem to have pretty much stopped since starting Paleo. I've not noticed any correlation between workout days and weightloss.

In previous years, summer meant spending time at home, teaching theatre to some incredibly talented youths, and refilling my happiness meter for the coming year. This year was different because I have a real job now. 8-5, monday through friday, sometimes saturdays, all of which necessitates getting up at 6 and being in bed around 11 (for someone who spent the last 10 years working theater/film gigs until all hours of the morning, this is rough). 

The worst part of it all though, is that all my close friends are still working those crazy hours, filming from 7pm to 6am then sleeping through the day. If I'm lucky they take some time off on the weekends and we hang out for a few hours, but for the most part, it's me in my world, and them in theirs. 

So that's fine, I've dealt with it, actually used it to motivate myself to work on my life, get some shit in order. Started eating better, exercising, and managed to make the most of it all.

Today was tough. They just finished their latest project, and I had hopes that I'd start seeing them again. So I get home from work, and think ""Hey, give the gang a call, go see a movie or just sit around and chat to catch up"" and as I get my phone out and mindlessly log onto facebook, I see a barage of statuses about going to the beach. All of them. To the beach, they apparently left 30 minutes before I left work. The kicker? I work not 30 minutes from the beach, while we live about an hour and a half away (that is my commute home, bleh). This hurt, really hurt. In the past, I would have called up dominos, gotten a pizza and some wings and just wallowed in it. And that sounded so deliciously good.

But fuck that. Because I can't let you all down like that. So I made a salad, went for a good power walk, and am now sipping some ice cold water telling you all that you're the shit. Because you are.  

That ended up really long...if you read it all, thanks!

We've made it through our first work week of our 90 days goal.  Give yourself a pat on the back!  If you haven't signed up w/ WLW yet, I encourage you to click the link on the sidebar and jump right in.

Last night I was feeling really depressed--on the verge of tears.  I didn't want to go the gym.  I wanted to lay down.  I wanted to buy a burger and forget everything.  I almost did.  But I thought about my commitment.  I thought about you ladies.  And I dragged my ass up and I went to the gym for 40 minutes.  Im so glad I did.

Today we are going to talk about: Motivation.

I encourage all of you to watch the following video before going further: [here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SbXgQqbOoU&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player)

*Deep breath.*  Such an inspirational video.  If Ben can do it, so can we!  So what is your primary motivation for wanting to lose weight?  Are you doing it for just your health?  Are you doing it for the summer season or an upcoming event?  Are you doing it to just feel damn good about yourself?  Whatever it is I ask you this: [Write it down](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Z7jjMlM1dFw/TftLLMkFHWI/AAAAAAAAAbA/vljU8LWKK-I/s640/IMAG0971.jpg).  Tape it in your mirror, your fridge or in your bedroom--somewhere where it will be a constant reminder.  Look at it.  Memorize it.  Because in your weakest moments I want you to be able to take a deep breath and recite this to yourself.  So next time you are offered some fries, next time you think about skipping the gym--you think about that.  Think about why you are doing it.  **YOU** are in control of your future.  How bad do you want this?

The weekend is about to start and this is where your commitment will really be tested.  I have been a victim of the weekend binge.  Basically, I undo all of the progress I made during the week.  Not this time! Lets kickstart the weekend on a postive note.

I have sooo much I want to discuss with you ladies including diet, support, etc.  But one day at a time!  Tomorrow I will post up our weekend discussion post to hold us over until Monday.

**Also**: In order to keep us accountable, I created a googledoc where we can keep record of our checkins.  So after you post here, [just take a second of your time to find your name under today's date and type 'yes'](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhqQKp18fJ4QdHMyZ1UyekZwMVM5TVJlLTB3UnQ2aUE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;authkey=CLjNrfMI).

I would be more than willing to send out PMs or emails or anything else you guys would like to keep us all pushing hard until the end of the round. 

I'm planning to keep setting up group challenges for us on Fitocracy throughout the round. The current challenge ends at the end of June. When I set up the next one, would you guys prefer weekly, biweekly, monthly challenges? 

Are there any fun/friendly challenges that we could set up for ourselves throughout the round? Something along the lines of the planks challenge that Mr_Nox and I have been doing. Nothing too stressful, but something to make each of us push ourselves to keep progressing.

What about weekly(?) Fitocracy threads to see how everyone is doing? Something around the lines of the ""What were your victories of the past week?"" threads that missdeejers posts to xxfitness. 

So... let's introduce ourselves and toss out any ideas for the group!

Well, I along with a lot of people did an analysis post at the end of the last round, it's [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/fsiit/fross_round_2_results_and_analysis_and_goals_for/) if you are interested.  I'm going to report on my final results and compare to my goals.  I'm not sure of goals for the next round yet, still need to do some thinking.

At the start of the round, I weighed 200lb.  I wasn't tracking my body fat but think it was about 15.5%.  My stats for this morning are:

Weight: 181lb, BMI 22.1

Body fat: 12.7% (!) This fluctuates, so I think it's around 13%)

Muscle mass: 42.4%

My goals for this round were:

1) Reach 185 lbs, later revised to 180 lbs!

I think I achieved this, very happy :)  I actually hit 179 a few weeks ago, but then had a couple of weeks of eating out and takeaway pizza etc, went up to 186, and battled it back down again.

2) Carry on c25k. Reach at least week 6 level of workout. 

I did this, precisely - got to week 6, then gave up!  Being able to do the 25 minute run all in one go was a big achievement, and really helped with my endurance.  I had little incentive to continue after that, but I did pick up with the bike riding instead.

3) Increase my pec dec/seated chest press (I've not done them before so not sure what to expect. They are currently 50lbs each, very low I know)

I had completely forgotten about this, and didn't do it.  I did want to work on my upper body though, and concentrated on pull-ups and push-ups - I can now do 6 chair-assisted pull-ups (up from 2), and am working on the 100 push-ups program - started being able to do 15, can now do 33.

4) Be cycling to work at least once per week.

Complete success here, I do it 2-3 times a week now.  

5) Be fit enough to pass the P90X basic fitness test. I plan to do P90X in Round 4.

I can now actually pass the P90X test, some better than others, but I can do it :)  I've decided I don't want to invest such a huge portion of time (more than anything else) into a fitness regime, plus I would have to adapt P90X to fit with my cycling, so I am not going to do this.

Overall, I think mission accomplished! I do feel a little directionless now, but I'm keeping up with the diet, aerobic and anaerobic fitness, which gives me a chance to make that decision later.  Now time to go out and buy some new clothes, that fit!

I began a low carb diet this week. I am aiming for  &lt; 80 g carbs including fiber (net &lt; 50 g). Turns out it is not as hard as expected. 
The thing I am worried about is that I am eating too much fat. Fat takes now the first place, I am getting most of my calories from it. Lets say I average around 40 - 50 % of my calories coming from fat per day. Protein ~ 40 %, carbs ~ 15 % fiber included.


So to have a clear question: Do I have to lower fat intake?

I guess I could cut the olive oil I am cooking with if I started steaming everything or using the oven, but fat is such a great flavor deliverer.

We have to get our community motivation up after seeing the last stats. So give us some good stories-------

I thought the [MISC] tag had to be used by someone, so I share my little story from the gym today. 

I went to the gym, actually feeling like crap because of the one hour time change, which stole an hour of sleep from me. I was feeling very tired and not very attractive, but eh I don´t care at all how I look at the gym.

So I, minding my own business on the yoga mat doing crunches, I see the super hot trainer coming over to me and trying to start making conversation. After some work out blah blah the conversation became more chatty and personal, which was predictable because he is not my trainer and I was not doing anything wrong. 

Boom, just a bit more into it I realized that he was flirting hardcore with me. It was soooo cliche that I really had trouble not calling him out on it. Instead I also did the dance.

You won´t believe how more cliche it became, he asked if we wanted to play ""tennis"" together. I am not fucking 16 and innocent anymore that I know that guys directly approach you to just become your friend and hang out.

I kept everything open and friendly, because I´d really like a tennis partner. We´ll see if I´ll eventually play some tennis with him and by tennis I really mean tennis :) I got a lot of guy friends but all of them I met in different ways.

But for tennis I´ll give it a shot and see if he is cool enough to become a guy friend. 

Overall I take it as a compliment that the hot trainer wants to get laid by me, even while looking my worst since i´ve joined the gym and actually never looking nice at the gym at all.

P.S.: Oh yea I know that my thinking is totally cliche too, which makes the story even better :)",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,True,,,True,t3_gdfoa,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/gdfoa/misc_i_thought_i_would_share_a_little_story_which/,

We had 376 people check in last week, with 310 people reporting their weight (20 weight gainers, 290 weight losers). Our weight gainers have put on a total of 40 lbs (18 kg) and our weight losers have lost a total of 617 lbs (280 kg) since the start of Round 3! 

Here are some charts for each group:

* [Weight gainers, total weight](http://i.imgur.com/hSClk.png)

* [Weight gainers, average weight](http://i.imgur.com/dNGGR.png)

* [Weight losers, total weight](http://i.imgur.com/51b1g.png)

* [Weight losers, average weight](http://i.imgur.com/hjotu.png)

It looks like we had some setbacks this week. :) On average, our weight gainers lost weight and our weight losers gained weight. My guess is that spring break, vacations, St. Patrick's day, and a general slowing of motivation probably have something to do with our reversed trends. How dare life get in the way of our progress :P

My suggestion: take a nice long look at our group numbers and use them as extra motivation to get back on top of your exercise routines and healthy eating. There's no reason to get discouraged by these numbers. Each of us can make an extra effort this week to get them moving in the right direction again!

Thank you so much to everyone for checking in, even if the numbers weren't what you were hoping for! Several people told me that they felt like they were ""messing up"" our data by checking in with an increased weight, but that really couldn't be further from the truth. The data is what it is. The only way to ""mess up"" the data is to start filtering out the numbers that we don't like. For these statistics to be meaningful, we need to collect data every week, not just the weeks that look good. So thank you for checking in!

how are you doing?

Yesterday was a good day. Weather was good so I said fuck it and started running again. Had some knee problems recently so I started with c25k's week 4 and used some cheap knee bandages. Everything went really well, besides the fact that I need to work on my endurance again. Back in 2010 I was running for 45 minutes, now I could hardly pull week 4 off. So my plan currently is to run twice a week for a maximum of 30 minutes (once I finish c25k again) and have at least 2 non-running days in between. Eating was okay, so the scale told me I lost a bit again.

Sleep is a different topic. Although Laura let us sleep yesterday (woke us up at 6 o'clock) I fucked up yesterday. Had to beat the final level + boss in Donkey Kong Country Returns which took me about 90+ tries (that game is hard). Finally finished (even though I skipped some levels).

Today is going to be my back and triceps day. We will see how that goes, but I assume the pull-ups will kill me again. Hopefully. I had cottage cheese for breakfast and will soon have chili. Bread and an after workout snack in the evening.

Congrats on achieving so much in round two. For goals that were not fully achieved let's begin again. We are warming up for round three now and if you were only half motivated in the last two rounds now is the time to get up and put an effort into round three. Challenge the (wo)man inside you, the one that is fit and energetic. The one you keep on putting to sleep with a constant supply of sugar. The one you keep telling you will do it tomorrow. Challenge yourself that the fitter you is the real you and you can do it. Tomorrow is NOW.

A lot of us achieved a good percentage of our goals. In fact we have compiled a few spreadsheets and charts on data that you guys provided us. We are hoping to use one such chart to encourage and bring more people into the group. Is everyone who submitted their stats happy to have their user name against a simple bar chart that shows the total weight and weight after 90 days? Nothing else, no location or detailed stats shown. If you would prefer to have your stats included without your user name, please let one of the mods know.

We would also request everyone to upvote [this news](http://www.reddit.com/r/90days/comments/fqyfm/important_please_join_us_before_we_start_the/) on the old subreddit 90days here so that people can join this subreddit instead. After doing that please unsubscribe from the old subreddit so that we know the correct numbers.

Let's get ready and hope that next Monday you will be a different person, a more energetic, fit and goal oriented person. Let's get off our asses and DO IT. Let's make tomorrow happen. We only have 90 days to go.

Negativity.  Whether it be from others or from ourselves, negativity can disrupt the progress that you have made for yourself.  In my case, I have a roommate that while supportive at face value, seems jealous of my lifestyle change.  You must be thick skinned in situations such as these.  When a person decides to lose weight or gain muscle, it doesn't go without notice amonst friends and family.  And while it would be ideal for everyone to be supportive, there is a great possibility that you will come across someone that is the opposite.  Actions can speak louder than words.  And having friends that try to continually convince you to eat something you shouldnt or go out drinking instead of working out can be counterproductive.  Of course we all have days where we want to relax.  As you should.  But be wary of patterns that start to rear their heads.  I'm going to take a [direct quote](http://www.suite101.com/content/negative-comments-can-disrupt-weight-loss-programs-a300199) :

**""For many people who have decided to control their weight in a healthy way, this aspect is a hurdle often more difficult to manage than the new food choices to be made. The dieter can start to feel the group is not as friendly or welcoming… perhaps acting differently in some subtle way.**

**When those in a group generally share the same issues, such as being overweight, they feel a sense of acceptance. They ease any apprehension they may have about their health and wellness by reminding themselves they are not alone with this issue. However, when one or two in a group change the status quo, then the rest feel anxious and reminded that their behaviors too need changing. People may feel envious of the dieter’s new empowerment and determination and often there are feelings of jealousy.""**

In short, be aware of what is going on around you.  Resilience is key.  Be strong!  We are in this together and it is not without hurdles.

I did stop and get a frozen yogurt cone from McDonalds (150 cal) but Im not gonna get upset about it.  Today has warmed up a bit so Im gonna go run.  I was supposed to do that yesterday.  As for dinner?  A wrap of some kind.

My weekend was absolutely lovely.  It's always a nice to just relax.  I also tried having an egg white scramble yesterday.  It was pretty yum!  I mixed it w/ onion, tomatoes, portabello mushrooms and bellpepper + a pinch of fat free cheese.  It was a great way to get my day started ;)  Speaking of ""day started""--I got my banana and giant glass of water next to me (sitenote: Drink lots of water!!).  For lunch, I have salad on the menu.

I will run 8 miles at an easy pace from my house to the gym, be there nice and early to enjoy the fact that no one is there, do some heavy lifting, and then jog the 3.5 miles to go directly home.

Half way through I was getting very winded and then I started to feel insecure/lazy/fat for it.  I sucked it up as best I could and with the encouragement of the BF, I got it done.  It's so easy to let myself throw in the towel but I just kept thinking about you guys and the end goal.

While we do not have someone condensing sources, materials, and plans into a common location, we still do have many of those materials. So, the question is how do we want to execute this ?  

As we are all in this together, I think it would be best if we worked together. While yes, we can stay within our groups and push one another within, I think working as a whole is a bit better for us, as we all have our goals to meet. Gaining, losing, really it is all the same when we focus on the health-based ramifications.  

So, my suggestion is that we continue. Welcome to day three, everyone. I hope you still have your bikes, your weights, or whatever you have; as long as we have a good foundation of nutrition and calories (and if we do not, we can always venture into /r/fitness land and read up), then we should begin a transition from theory to execution, beginning tonight. Tomorrow. Whenever you feel comfortable, but not too long down the road.  

We all made goals, we made commitments, we made a promise to ourselves; let us not allow hurdles or setbacks to get in the way.

To celebrate the end of the first sprint, I'd like to dedicate today's daily goal to reflections on your goals over the past month. Refresh us with your starting goals and let us know how your progress toward them is going. Have you met some (or all) of them? Keep in mind that not meeting a goal is *not* a failure. Goals help keep you focused and drive you forward, but they should be flexible enough to change as you learn things along the way. Are there any you'd like to revise now that you've been working toward them for a while? Do you have new goals in mind for the next sprint?

And after reflecting a bit, let's hear your daily goals! What are your plans for today? How about the rest of the week? How did your goals go yesterday?

I hope you have a great day! :D

If any of the data is not correct, or you can't find yourself, please send us a modmail, or note it in the comments, and we can fix it or help find you!

Please remember that weight fluctuates a lot, so don’t get caught up in the number.  As long as you’re working toward your goals, you can pretty much ignore the scale.  Remember, it takes 21 days to build a habit, so if it still feels hard, keep plugging away for another week and by the end of this third week, hopefully things will start to click!

I have been this weight only since New Years Eve. I should weigh about 55lbs less. So my goal is to lose 55lbs by the end of September. I used to be in great shape but fell into a deep dark depression over the last ten years. Even though I was consistently working out I would also drown my sorrows as well as eat them. I had an epiphany about 15 minutes ago. I am sick of being overweight with more body fat than ever in my life. If i could start right now I would but it is time for bed and this weekend is going to be busy with work. My clothes don't fit, i have rolls on my tummy, and I fart too much for my own comfort. Having done some research on different exercises and routines I feel comfortable with a few that I can fit into my schedule and won't leave me feeling weak and tired. I also will be cleaning my fridge and replacing not good food with not bad food. I feel good about going into this change in my life and I know I will actually do this because I have gotten through my depression. I finally feel good about who I am.

My day has started off on quite the wrong foot with the thunderstorms and the people I'm assisting today. But that is the way things go. Its good its bad and sometimes its even downright terrible. 

Dealing with this injury is one of those things in fitness where its just not great. I get out climbing but I am weak from the rest and I can't climb what I want because I need to hold back while it heals. 

Over the past 70 days you have experienced ups and downs and fantastic days and bad days. The important thing to remember is that you are working towards a goal that will always be good for you. A healthier lifestyle or losing/gaining weight. It everything went perfectly you wouldnt be human. So just remember to take the bad with the good and keep working hard. You only fail when you quit not when you get back on the horse.

So let us know what you are going to do today in the name of your goals!

How is everyone doing today?  The end of the first sprint is tomorrow!  What did you do over the weekend?  What do you have planned for today?

Being frustrated with my lack of weight loss, I've recently decided to put my scientific training into use and am doing experiments with my diet.  Unfortunately, this means that I've had to cut out a lot of my favorite foods, so I'm having cravings like no one's business.  **How do you guys deal with cravings?**

Do you give in and have a bit?  Or does giving in and having a bit make you just eat more?  Do you try to find a healthier substitute?  If so, what have you found?  Do you drink water when you crave something to see if it goes away?  In essence, how do you get rid of cravings without ruining your hard work?

I'm going to be in a tiny little room with a big electromagnet (again), so I won't be able to respond to things right away.  Don't worry, though!  I'll make sure to try to say hello to everyone!

Today we’re going to discuss our **gym bag essentials**!  This is something I’m always curious about, since I like to know what others find useful to take with them to the gym.  Do you carry anything with you in the gym, itself?  Some people have a workout journal or paper, some might prefer to record activities on their phones, others might remember it, and some might not take note at all!  What do you find necessary to keep in your gym bag and take with you when you head out to do some exercise?  Do you usually take “real” clothes and things to freshen up afterwards, or do you do all of that at home?

Let us know what gear you take along!  Additionally... **FOOD FRIDAY**!  If you have any awesome new (or old... they’ll still be new to us!) recipes, feel free to post ‘em!  And also, feel free to update us on your plans for the weekend ahead - any cool fitness-y things going on?  Any cool non-fitness-y things??  Have an incredible weekend!

Its Thursday and I had a fun little interaction this week where someone spent the time to find out my goals for fitness and let me know they support me but also that if I couldn't hang out that night they would understand. They didn't want to get in the way of my fitness goals since they know I'm testing next week for my Brown Belt.

It just puts an interesting spin on things when someone is supportive of my fitness. To be honest most people don't ask or care and those who do find it a little more extreme than the norm and worry about me.  I almost find this kind of unfortunate because I do consider myself a good resource and would love to help more people. 

So how often do people talk to you about your fitness goals? Do you often offer up the info willingly? Is it something you keep closer to the chest? As we work on setting new goals for this coming round do you tell a lot of people or work on yourself silently? An interesting part of fitness for me has always been how it comes into play with my relationships.

What has to happen (or not happen) to make you ask others for help?  Do you just do everything on your own, regardless of progress or lack thereof?  Do you set a deadline and if you miss the deadline, is that when you find a professional to help you reach your goals?  Do you always ask others for help?

What is one of your favorite recipes?  If you have more than one, let us know about the others too!  If you can link to the recipe, great!  If not, type it out so we can all try it out.  I'm sure a lot of you have a huge collection of delicious recipes and I want in on that collection.

If you are following a particular diet or food-restriction (vegetarian, low-carb, etc), you can make a note of it so people who are following a similar diet can find your recipe fairly quickly.

I hope everyone has a wonderful day!

I can’t believe that this we’re so close to wrapping up this round!  How was your past week in terms of running?  Any races that you did?  Any upcoming?  My last week’s runs were good, this week’s are fairly light because I am tapering for my 10 mile race on Saturday!  It’s my first race of the season and it’s going to be pretty small in comparison to the my last big race, the half I did in November (300-350 people vs. 35,000 people!!), but I’m very excited!

As we near the end of the round, it’s likely that you’ve now gotten some more mileage under your belt... and with more mileage comes more **running stories**, so that’s today’s topic!  I love hearing about the experiences of other runners, so I’d love to hear some of yours :D  Maybe it’s running into someone you knew, or something strange or silly you saw, or even just an AWESOME run as a whole for no other reason than you were just *feeling* good.   Let’s share!

How are you doing today?  What do you have planned?  What did you do yesterday?  Any accomplishments?  How are you progressing towards your goals?  We only have 20 days left!

Since we started this round, everyone has made amazing progress!  We talked a bit last week about our victories.  This week, I want to what you've had to give up for this journey.  What **sacrifices** have you had to make?

These sacrifices could be types of food or it could be your social life.  Some people stop going out when they are trying to better their health simply because going out is too tempting and unhealthy for them.  Others can manage it but have to still make small sacrifices, like not drinking at all or cutting out entire food groups.  Other people have to sacrifice free time in order to fit in working out.  Hobbies might have to get put aside in order to make room for a run or a lifting session.

How does sacrificing the things you did make you feel?  Do you miss and/or crave them still or have you replaced what has been sacrificed with something else?  Basically, how do you cope?

We've talked about a lot of different things in here over the past couple of months.  Everyone has come up with inspirations, how to deal with stress, illness, and other roadblocks, food, rewards, support systems, dealing with people, and so much more.  From this, I hope everyone learned something new.  Now it's time to share some of your secrets to getting by; I want to know what **life hacks** you have!

Life hacks are anything you do that makes something easier with minimal effort.  For instance, I hate making a mess in the bathroom when I wash my face (water *everywhere*), so my little life hack is to use a corner of a washcloth to do the ""face getting wet"" and ""rinsing off face"" part of washing up and then using the rest of it to dry my face off.  No mess at all!

Your life hacks don't have to be fitness related!  Perhaps you'll learn something from someone here that you can use!

todays topic, cheating. Cheating can have many forms, be it

- a butchered range of motion (doing push-ups without your nose touching the ground or bench presses where the bar is not touching your chest)

- using other muscles to make exercises easier (Overhead Press with leg interference or chin-ups using momentum with your legs)

- half-assing an exercise

- etc.

This is more problematic for people who are not at a gym and have not a trainer yell at them when they do something wrong. In that spirit, take a look at your execution and make sure that you do everything right, because in the end you are only cheating yourself.

So how are you guys doing today / how was yesterday?

For me personal, things are not that well. I am not fully recovered yet, so no sports and my kids are, of course, getting sick again.

Then, when you go for a run, go to the gym, or get together with a bunch of friends to play a sport, how does your mood change?  Do you get ""runner's high""?  Do you walk away calmer, happier, more at peace, or any ""more positive"" feeling?  When you're stressed, do you have a routine that you follow to help you deal with the stress?  Some people meditate, while others go weight lifting, go for a walk, do some yoga, run, or climb a wall.  What do you do?

I hope everyone has an awesome day!

For me, it's that wonderful time of the month: Shark Week!  Of course, when Aunt Flo comes to visit, many of us get nasty cramps, fatigue, and general blah-ness.  **How do you deal with exercise and cravings during Shark Week?**

Do you take time off?  If you do, do you take the whole time off, or do you only take certain days off?  Do you suck it up and continue working out, letting absolutely nothing stop you?  Or do you continue working out, as long as you don't feel like you're going to die?

How do you deal with cravings and sticking with your diet?  What do you crave?  Do you give in to those cravings, even if they're not healthy?  Do you find a way to give your body what it's craving but in a healthier fashion?  Do you find that you eat more than normal or do you stay pretty consistent?

1357652932.0,10,self.90daysgoal,166l0t,[Runners] - Week 6 - Running Shoes!,10,0,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/166l0t/runners_week_6_running_shoes/,"Good morning, runners!  Hope you guys have had some great runs this past week - any races, PR’s, new courses, or strange wildlife encounters?  

This week’s topic is something that is plays an ENORMOUS role in running, and that is **running shoes**!!  They’re those things that you wear on your feet, and they have the potential to have a big impact on your running :)  

First, let’s talk about how your **foot strikes** the ground.  When running in sneakers, you typically use a *heel strike*, meaning that your heel is the first part of your foot to hit the ground and then roll towards the ball of your foot.  This is similar to how you walk - try taking a few steps and think about how your foot “rolls” from heel to toe, and that’s similar to how your foot hits the ground while running.  Another type of foot strike that some runners use is a *mid-foot strike*, where that initial pressure as you strike the ground is in the middle area of the foot.  There is a third type of foot strike, most often found in barefoot or minimalist running, is a *forefoot strike*, meaning that the ball of the foot is what hits the ground first.  This type of running also often applies to sprinters - next time you sprint, you might want to notice the difference between your foot strike for sprinting and for “regular” running.  With minimalist and barefoot running, a mid-foot strike is also fairly common.  

Now that we’ve talked about foot strike, let’s talk about **pronation**.  Pronation is the rotation of the foot while running, and is the body’s method of absorbing shock.  For someone with *neutral pronation*, their foot will initially strike on the outer side of the heel and roll towards the center of the body in order to distribute the weight evenly, and their knees usually stay in line over the big toe; this is natural and ideal.  For someone with *overpronation*, their foot will also initially strike on the lateral side of the heel, but as it rolls toward the center of the body it will roll too far and the weight will be distributed unevenly, and the knee will often track inward; overpronation causes shock to not be absorbed as well, and can result in problems with collapsing arches or ankles rolling inwards.  For someone with *underpronation*, their foot will also initially strike that same way, though the foot won’t roll far enough, distributing the weight unevenly and the knee may track towards the outside of the big toe; underpronation also causes shock to not be absorbed well, and the arches or ankles may not have much motion. 

So, we’ve discussed foot strike and pronation, but what does this have anything to do with shoes?!  Well, shoes are often designed with these things in mind!  A lot of running shoes have cushioning or padding, especially in the heel (as opposed to the forefront) since that tends to be the area of the foot that pounds on the ground and have the most pressure on it.  *Minimalist shoes*, however, don’t have particularly much padding and are designed to be fairly close to being barefoot, but with protection for your feet from whatever you may encounter on your run.  For neutral runners, they usually just use *neutral shoes* with regular padding, which usually provides some arch support and shock absorption.  For mild to moderate pronators, as well as neutral runners, *stability shoes* are useful and help make the rolling of the foot a bit more stable.  For moderate to severe pronators, *motion control shoes* are designed to do just that, control the motion of the foot.  All of these shoes are designed with the intention of reducing the likelihood of injury.

How do you know what type of shoe is best for you?  I would suggest going to a running store and getting fitted - after being properly fitted at a specialty store, I discovered I mildly overpronate and need a bit of a wider shoe... I felt IMMENSELY better when running with the new shoes, which fall into that middle category of “stability”.  In fact, I love them so much that when I got new running shoes a few weeks ago I wound up sticking with the same ones, and just upgraded to the new version :D

Now on to the **questions for this week**:

* How did you pick your shoes?  Were you fitted or did you chose them on your own?  How do you like them?
* Do you know what type you need, or do you know if you’re an overpronator, underpronator, or neutral pronator?
* Have you tried barefoot or minimalist running?  What was your experience with that?
* How often do you get a new pair of shoes?  Was it a difficult transition, or was it fairly smooth?  
* Any other shoe-related comments?

* Exercise reduces stress and makes you feel great - two things you need if you have a family like mine. 

I'm off this week, so my optimal week is shifted a bit.

* Mon - Run in the morning, first thing to get it out of the way and get my mind right. Then I can enjoy the holiday.

Since we're wrapping up the second week and almost halfway through the first sprint, I want to talk about **staying on track**.

What do you to stay on track?  What's the most likely thing to derail you?  Do you have a hard time picking yourself back up again?  Do you ever reward yourself when you stay consistent?

Think about what can derail you and come up with a plan on how to circumvent that or at least mitigate it.  When life gets in the way, what are you going to do?  Are you going to stop entirely, keep on exercising and dieting, or are you going to drop one or the other?

1355234896.0,9,self.90daysgoal,14nxzc,[Runners] - Week 2 - Food &amp; Fuel!,12,3,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/14nxzc/runners_week_2_food_fuel/,"Good morning, fellow runners :D  There was so much fantastic discussion on last week’s introduction post, and it’s great that you’re all with us again this week!  A lot of you said that you wanted a post about diet and food, so here we go!

**What diet is optimal for a runner?**  

Well, a lot of that is dependent on you and your body and how *you* perform best.  It’s really important to fuel your body with healthy foods - if you subsist on junk, you might be fine when you run but do you really think you’ll be performing to the absolute best of your ability?  Now, I’m not saying that you must eat all-healthy all-the-time - I tend to indulge in some froyo or chocolate every now and then - but it’s important to find a balance.  There are so many different diets out there, and each can be modified and tailored to you.  Some people have found success with a ketogenic diet (check out [r/keto] (http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/), some prefer a paleo diet ([r/paleo] (http://www.reddit.com/r/paleo/), others prefer higher carb, and others prefer something totally different!  You need to find what ultimately works for you and check in with yourself to see how your body responds and performs in reaction to what you’re eating.  If you aren’t sure, try keeping a food log and exercise log - after you are done exercising, evaluate how you felt - did you feel awesome and PR that day whereas the day before you struggled, and was there any difference in what you ate?  

A lot of us are trying to lose weight here, and therefore we’re trying to not consume as many calories.  **PLEASE** make sure that you are eating enough to fuel your running!!!  It is crucial that you are getting enough nutrients; you don’t necessarily have to “eat back” all of the calories you burn, but being at a severe deficit will likely be detrimental in the long run.  If you are interested in calculating how many calories you are burning per mile, [this] (http://www.runnersworld.com/weight-loss/how-many-calories-are-you-really-burning-0?page=single) may be a useful article.  Side note:  I some had trouble finding the full article it lists at the bottom that it adapted the info from, but managed to download a copy of it through my university library.  If you’d like me to send you it then just PM me and I’d be happy to email it along.  

I’d also like to include a bit about hydration - not quite food, but it certainly fuels your body!  I had a really scary experience with dehydration after one of my long runs a few weeks ago and almost ended up passing out in a CVS... luckily I wasn’t driving or in an unsafe place, so it taught me quite an important lesson - drink, drink, drink!!

So now that I’ve posted a bit of information above, let’s get some discussion going about what we find works for us, both in daily life and specifically during runs and races.  I’d love to hear **your responses to the following:**

* What sort of diet have you found works best for you to fuel your daily life and your running?  If you are still trying to figure it out, what have you tried before and how did you feel?
* What is your go-to pre-running meal or snack, and why?
* Post-running?
* Does your pre-race meal vary from your usual pre-running food?
* Hydration - do you prefer water?  Gatorade? Something else?
* Fuel during runs - do you use any fuel *during* your runs?  Blocks? Gels? Bursts? Bars? And at what point in your run do you take them?  To the people who are new to running and aren’t sure what this means, this may be more relevant when you start running longer distances that require you to consume fuel during your run to keep your energy level up.

As always, we encourage discussion here at 90daysgoal, so if you have any questions, suggestions, or whatever, feel free to comment on each other’s posts!!!",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,self8,True,t3_14nxzc,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/14nxzc/runners_week_2_food_fuel/,

Good morning, 90ers! Congratulations on conquering the first week! :) If you haven't already done so, please take a second to fill out the [R9 signup form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGNSWG9DZWc4Vm16ZF9FU19YaTdzNFE6MQ#gid=0) and [introduce yourself to everyone](http://redd.it/142fey).

Now that we've wrapped up the first week, it's time to check in for Week 2. [**Here's the check-in form.**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGNSWG9DZWc4Vm16ZF9FU19YaTdzNFE6MQ#gid=0) Please remember that weight fluctuates a lot, so don’t get caught up in the number. As long as you’re working toward your goals, you can pretty much ignore the scale. The check-in data will be used for group stats though, so please check in even if your weight is up this week. Keep working hard, keep coming back, keep checking in, and the results will come.

Whether you are new to running, have been running for a long time, or are somewhere in the middle, we’re glad to have you here!  These weekly threads (which I’ll be posting every Tuesday) will be a place where we can come together to discuss anything about running... training plans, accomplishments and PRs, race prep, shoes and gear, or anything else!  

For this first week, let’s start out with **running-related intros** - let’s hear about you and your experience with running!!

* How did you get into running?  How long have you been running?
* Do you have a running goal for Round 9 as a whole, and any for specifically Sprint 1?  What is it?
* Do you have a specific training plan you are going to follow?  Please share :D (side note, if you need plans but aren’t sure where to find them, you can check these out:  [Couch to 5K] (http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml), [Bridge to 10K] (http://blog.bluefinapps.com/about-bridge-to-10k/), [Half-Marathon] (http://www.runnersworld.com/training-plans/half-marathon-training-plans), [Marathon] (http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_4/143.shtml))
* Do you have any upcoming races and any goal times?
* Any cool running accomplishments that you’d like to share?  It doesn’t have to be about races, it can just be anything you feel like was a big deal to you with running!
* Do you have any ideas for future running thread topics that you would like to see?
* Anything else you’d like to tell us about yourself, running-related or not?

Here’s a little bit about me - 

*  I’m fairly new to running, last round (8) was my first here at 90dg, and I started running a bit just as a way to get in some exercise and cardio.  I signed up for a 5K with a friend that was at the end of September and wanted to drop some time, so I started running more... I had previously HATED running and only did it when I needed to for high school sports, but something clicked this time around and I’ve come to enjoy it!  
*  For Round 9 as a whole, I’d like to get to around 25 miles per week, running at least 3x/week, and would like to get to a sub-27min 5K.  Currently, I’m around 29:09 from a test run that I did last Wednesday.  For Sprint 1, I’m hoping to get down to about 28:15.
*  Training plan... not following anything specific, just going to continue on a similar path as my half-marathon training plan - lifting 2x/week, crosstraining 2-3x/week, run 3-4x/week (two or three shorter runs between 3-5 miles, or more as I increase mileage, and one long run), and a rest day!
*  I haven’t signed up for any races, but I have been checking some out.  I have found a few 5Ks in April and May, and am thinking about another half that’s in June.  It’s tough finding winter races, though I did find a 5K in February that looks somewhat promising...   Goal time for my next half may be about 2:10,  which would require me to drop about 15 minutes from my first half, slightly over a minute per mile (so I would need to do 10ish minute miles the whole time) - any experienced runners think this is feasible, or should I not aim to drop so much time?  Goal time for 5K is hopefully sub-27min by the end of the round!  I’d also like to do a sprint triathlon, which includes a 5K run, and a marathon at some point during 2013.
*  I did a half-marathon the Sunday before Thanksgiving, and was able to run the whole thing... something I never expected to do.  And I finished much faster than expected (about 2:26) And I actually want to do it again, and even do a full... who woulda thought?!?  I’m also excited that I *like* running - I consider that an accomplishment.
* I’m trying to come up with ideas, so I’ll definitely be looking at everyone’s answers to this question :D
* Quick run-down of myself:  22F, college student, new-ish to running, nervous but excited for my first winter running season, big fan of listening to fast-paced pop, alternative, and hip-hop while running... anything with a solid beat to keep me movin’!

So, now it’s your turn - tell us about yourself!

* OHP: 65

* Powerclean: 65

* Squat: 140

* Bench: 125

1. Did you have weight loss/gain/stasis goals? If so, how was your progress? Anything you would have done differently?

2. Did you have health goals? Did you make appreciable progress?

3. I know some of you ran half marathons, completed 5Ks, and set personal records with speed or with strength, even with number of days you went to a gym this time around. Congrats! Tell us more about participation in competitions with others and with yourself.

4. Did you take on a new sport or dance or start going to a new gym, start running a new trail, change your workout space in a positive way?

5. How have your eating habits evolved this round? Did you start following a new food lifestyle?

6. Did you hit a bunch of roadblocks this time around? These frustrations can really get in the way of you taking care of yourself. Let us know, if you're comfortable talking about it, and maybe we can brainstorm ways to help one another get through our stuff in rounds to come.

7. How did you feel about the community this time around? Round 9 is in the planning stages, and any discussion of your experience with 90daysgoal, expectations, and suggestions for improvement will aid us in making the community a better tool for us all.

8. Tell us your victories! Did you lose fat that you wanted to lose, put on muscles, complete physical therapy, kick ass in that race, reduce your cholesterol?

It has been a crazy week. I should have tested for my next belt last night in Taekwondo but since being injured I couldn't give my 100% so I need to wait. This whole knee thing is taking forever! But I need to be patient. I am actually leaving for a climbing trip for a few days tomorrow and I couldn't be more excited. I think I love these trips because its a good reminder of how far I have come. 

So are you working on your fitness for an overarching goal? Is there something you wish to do when you get fit enough? I want to hear about your dreams and how you plan to reach em. 

Tonight is driving to Philly to fly out tomorrow with a friend to NC. No working out because I will be climbing and hiking for 3 days straight. What are you up to?

I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to a fresh start to the round. The scale I've been using crapped out on me, and I've been so busy, I haven't gotten a new one for the household.

Speaking of houses, I got approved for a mortgage and am going to go look about purchasing my first home on Saturday afternoon. There's apparently a really nice hiking trail that runs along the gravel road that is the street this house is situated upon. I look forward to hiking that with the doggies as much as I can, though I don't really feel up to it on Saturday.

The ghost of old injuries has come back to haunt me today. With the weather being crazy, my dad's arthritis is really acting up, and today, my old ankle injury and my bad wrist have both been causing me considerable soreness and a little angst. Additionally, I jogged a little bit to catch up with the dogs' running, and the tissue in my abdomen prone to soreness is, surprise, a little sore. I think it's time for my boyfriend to start taking the dogs out for a few days.

Preventative care advice seems like cold comfort when you've already got some busted body parts. To cope with mine, I have a cadre of braces and supports that I wear to walk, type, whatever. I wore an ankle brace for about 6 months to support my ankle after twisting it while camping. Looks like it's time to bust it out again on a selective basis. Upgrading my shoes may also work; I've got old sneakers and movable shoe inserts that keep my arches supported but may not provide all the support I need to keep my ankle from turning in a pothole or when the dogs pull me down a steep hill.

Tell me about your palliative care that keeps you going, if you've got routines that keep you moving, etc.

Hope everyone who lives on the east coast survived Hurricane Sandy.  I got lucky and got two days off work because the government was closed, and there was not too much damage/power outages in my area (DC).  I think NY/NJ got it worse, so hopefully everyone's ok.

How are you all doing on this last day of October?  What are your goals/plans for today?  I for one am glad to be ending this month.  Looking forward to a productive November.  My goals for the day are to go to my chiropractor appointment and then pack for my trip home tomorrow to see my new niece!

Weekend review time!  How did everyone do w/ their goals this past weekend?  Did you meet them? Why or why not?

Well, it was all things Halloween for me this weekend!  I dressed up as Jem from my beloved 80s cartoon.  I wanted to be 'Pizzazz', but the dress was horrendous.  Not that my Jem one was much better...the quality of the material was hilarious.  Even still, I bought glittery stilletos (oh yes I did) &amp; a pink push up bra.  So I made it work lol.  &amp;since I waited last minute, my weekend was filled w/ a lot of running around.  I need to post a picture of the get up later! :D

So we are Day 68, gals!  That gives us 22 more days for this round.  Lets make it count!  Let us know what your goals are for the day!  &amp;above all else, dont forget to support your fellow WLWers!

Pretty sure I can barely walk well. Its really ridiculous. But I am doing what I need to get better and will go see a doctor if it stops showing signs of improvement. So for now I am just resting and watching my diet.

How is your week going? Have you had to deal with Injuries lately? Do you know how to deal with one if it creeps up. Or if you limbo to hard? I really am an idiot haha. Its a theme for me to hurt myself in inane ways while on vacation. I'm glad this is no exception. Have a great day everyone!

How are you doing today?  What is on your list of things to get done?  How was yesterday?  Did you hit all of your goals?

We've almost got two full weeks under our belts!  We're all working hard towards our goals, so I think it's a good time to discuss **dealing with negativity**.

Sometimes negativity towards your lifestyle change comes in the form of people saying things like ""you need to eat a cheeseburger, not go work out.""  Other times, it comes in a more disguised form, such as ""You don't need to lose weight!"" or ""Man, keep this up and you'll start making me look bad.""  No matter how it is presented, it can really throw you off your game.  Your support system may crumble.  Friends may stop taking your dietary restrictions into consideration when going out or at the very least, make them seem less important.

How does negativity manifest itself in your life?  What do you do when this happens (how do you react)?  Do you shoot a snarky comment back at the haters?  Or do you let the issue slide and keep doing what you're doing?  Or even stop trying for that one moment?  

I want to know how you deal with negativity!

Also, sorry for the incredibly early post.  I'm not sleeping very well and this coming morning is going to be very busy, so I figured I would use my insomnia as a time to post something.

Last week we talked about [Starter Programs](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/y99he/weightlifting_week_1_getting_started/), and you were all challenged to either pick a routine to stick with for this sprint - or otherwise tell us about your program if you were on one already. Now that you've hopefully got your routine planned out, it's time to dive deeper.

As always, myself and **nanochic** will be here to guide you through this week's topic - or anything you might have in mind. We'd also like to formally announce that in addition to the weekly topic, we'd *love* to see you guys post your weekly training logs in this thread. Whether you're looking for advice, comparisons, or just flat out want to brag about a recent PR or lift - share away!

--------

**Weekly Discussion Topic: Nutrition**

This week's topic is **nutrition**.  Nutrition is *incredibly* important, no matter if you are trying to gain or lose weight or even maintain. If you're lifting, proper nutrition is a must. A good diet won't save a poor routine, but a bad diet can and will invalidate even the most dedicated of lifting routines. Depending on what your goals are, you'll be on either a caloric surplus or deficit. Regardless of whether you're trying to go up or down, protein is about to become your new best friend.


***Protein: The one constant in workout nutrition***


Muscle growth is dependent on the cycle of imposing stress on your muscle fibers through your workout, and then rebuilding and repairing those muscle fibers through your nutrition. You don't build muscle in the gym - you build muscle away from the gym. 

There are a lot of recommendations on how much protein is enough: 1g/lb body weight, 3g/kg body weight, 1g/lb of lean body mass... the list goes on. The short answer is that there is no hard and fast rule for an exact amount that each individual should consume; it varies by person, activity level, and a whole host of other factors. Since there is no real danger in getting too *much* protein, the most practical method to go by is to use a range and to aim high. For *most* people on *most* routines, getting 1 gram of protein per pound of total body weight (lean mass and fat) is enough.

Now that you know how much - you might be wondering when to consume this protein. First of all, how you split your protein in your meals [doesn't matter](http://examine.com/faq/how-much-protein-can-i-eat-in-one-sitting.html). Do what works best for you; a couple of small meals or a few big ones, you don't need to alter your eating habits. As long as you get a good source of protein as often as possible, you can chow down however you wish.

Don't worry about getting your protein *immediately* after your workout, either. The most beneficial window to consume protein is the first 24-48 hours after your workout. This window is so large that you really don't need to worry about nutrient timing, or chugging a shake right as you leave the gym. Stick to your diet goals on a daily and weekly basis, and you'll be just fine!

A word on protein shakes. They're not magic, they aren't special, and they aren't required. They are a *fantastic* way to add protein to any diet, as you can take your normal diet, slap in 2 scoops of whey protein and immediately get 50-60g more protein per day, but they aren't required. If you find yourself needing more protein, you can add shakes. You could also add chicken, turkey, ground beef, steak, eggs, milk, peas, beans, lentils... you get the idea! Looking for a specific brand? [Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard](http://www.amazon.com/Optimum-Nutrition-Standard-Double-Chocolate/dp/B000QSNYGI/ref=pd_sim_hpc_1) is frequently seen as one of the better brands. I prefer chocolate, but everyone has different tastes...

***Nutrition on a bulk: EAT ALL THE THINGS!***


Eating on a bulk is fun. There are two main schools of thought: ""Clean"" bulking/eating, and ""IIFYM"", aka ""if it fits your macros"", aka ""dirty"" bulking. I'm not going to get into a debate between one versus the other - other than to say that they are both options, many people have had a lot of success with both. If you want to eat chicken &amp; veggies to pack on muscle, go for it. If you want to have the occasional (or often) big mac...you can fit that in too.

To properly feed yourself on a bulk, you want to get enough protein and get enough calories. Not surprisingly, in order to build muscle mass, you need to eat above maintenance. Simply eating at maintenance and lifting won't do you a whole lot of good for bulking. You can't ""turn muscle into fat"" directly, so to gain weight, you need to eat at a surplus. Pretty simple, right?

Going a little deeper into details, a safe starting point for most people is 500 calories over maintenance.  What is your maintenance? *That* is extremely hard to say, and the only real way to answer this is through dedicated calorie tracking and observations of your body weight. There are a bunch of online *estimation* calculators online - I'm partial to [this one](http://www.1percentedge.com/ifcalc/) if you want to use it as a starting point. If you already know your maintenance level, tack on 500 extra calories per day and start recording your weight. If you haven't seen a noticeable weight gain after 2 weeks, you probably want to up your intake by another 300-500 calories, and calculate again in another 2 weeks. For most people, a safe target to shoot for is 0.5 - 1lb of weight gained per week.

These are the *basics*. There's a lot more advanced options out there that take this basic principle a step further to maximize muscle gain and minimize fat gain. LeanGains attempts to cycle your intake and your macros so that you consume at a surplus on lifting days, and maintenance or a slight deficit on off days. These discussions are best saved for another day, let us know if you want to get into these details in a later weekly topic!


***Nutrition on a cut: Playing the numbers game***


Eating and lifting while trying to lose weight a little bit trickier. The same principles apply: rule #1 - get enough protein. This time, rule #2 is flipped to the more familiar: eat below maintenance. Strength training is not a huge calorie burner, and since maintenance is so hard to calculate exactly right - the simplest and easiest way is to try and eat around 500 calories below maintenance on average, which will put you in a target area of 1lb/week lost.


One very important note here though is that there is such a thing as losing too much weight too fast. One [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615615) (popular on reddit) suggests that there is a maximum rate of fat your body can lose per day, before you start burning muscle for energy. That number is 22 calories/day/lb of fat. You'll need to do your own math here, but as a quick example a 200 lb individual at 20% body fat would be able to eat (200 lbs * 20% = 40 lbs/fat) -&gt; (40 * 22 calories/day) = 880 calories under maintenance per day before losing muscle.

The reason this is so important is that you don't want to ""make up"" for one day by overdoing it the other day. If your maintenance is 2,000 calories, do not try to catch up on a bad day by only eating 900 calories the next day. You're not going to lose any more fat, and you're only going to rob yourself of that hard earned muscle. The scale might tell you it worked out, but your muscles will tell you another story.

When you're on a surplus, it's pretty easy to get enough proteins to build muscle, carbs to give you energy, and fats to keep you full - there's plenty of everything. When you're on a cut, just getting enough protein can be rough. For me, my off days on a cut are 1,800 calories, and I aim to get at least 180 grams of protein - not always easy! 

There's no real ""trick"" to this I've found - you need to be dedicated to tracking your calories, understand how to get your macros for the day, and have the discipline to stick to them. Some people count *macros* rather than calories. If you hit your protein, carb, and fat goals for the day, you'll implicitly hit your calorie goals. This can be a ""simpler"" way to track everything rather than working backwards off calories.

How did yesterday go?  Did you hit your goals?  If not, that's okay.  Just get back on and keep going!

Yesterday we talked a lot about social situations.  A lot of you had awesome ideas on how to combat food being pushed at you, as well as how to attend a social event and still stick to your diet.  Some of you have trouble not giving in and that's okay.  Read some of the posts by your fellow WLW'ers and try out some of their suggestions!

**Today**, I want to discuss something completely different: **athletic clothing**.  

We're halfway through the first week and I know most of you have already started exercising and are getting off of the right foot.  When you exercise, what is your go-to outfit?  What sort of underwear do you wear (if any at all)?  What's your favorite sports bra?  We're obviously all different sizes, so the more people who chime in with their favorite brands of athletic attire, the better!

For those of you who are getting started with lifting weight, what's your favorite shoe to wear?  For all of you runners out there, what do you like to run in?  Do you like your standard running shoes or do you prefer minimalist shoes?  Everyone who does yoga, pilates, dance, etc., do you wear footies to help keep traction?  What about gloves (same goes for you, weight lifters)?

I want to know what you love to work out in and where you get it, because, hey, let's face it, we're all going to have to update our wardrobes pretty soon!

If there is anything else you want to talk about, please let me know!

[Yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/y77yu/dailygoal_day_2_august_14_2012/) we discussed diet, and if there are any questions remaining, please feel free to ask.  We love questions and feedback.

Today's topic is *exercise*.

---

Some general tips:

* You can lose weight without exercise, but it's going to be more difficult, slower, and you'll likely end up losing muscle in addition to fat.

* The better route for weight loss is to incorporate activities into your daily routines to *get you up and moving and using your muscles more than you did before*. Whatever level of activity you're at now, try ramping it up a bit. That might mean taking the stairs instead of the elevator or adding a walk after dinner. Or it might mean lifting heavier weights at the gym or running a bit faster on your next jog.
Our [Weekly Challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/y52xo/weekly_challenge_week_1/) are a great way to keep yourself moving throughout the day.

* *Track your progress*. It's too easy to get bored with your routines if you don't have a way to measure your progress. Even just keeping a paper log of your lifts can help you here. If you're going to be jogging, running, swimming, biking, ellipticalling, or any other cardio, try measuring your speed, distance, duration, or whatever other metric you'd like to use. After a few weeks go by, flip back to the start of your log so you can see how far you've come.

* *Push yourself*. If your chosen activities don't get your heart rate up, then you should probably add in something that's a little more challenging to you.

* Cardio is great, but *cardio plus weight lifting is* **much** *better*. There are lots of reasons to add weight lifting. The simplest is that you'll build or maintain muscle as you lose fat, which will prevent you from getting to a low weight with a high body fat percentage. Ladies: don't be afraid to lift heavy.  Whether you’re a beginning lifter looking for tips or an experienced lifter looking for a place to discuss equipment/records/etc., check out nymeatball’s weekly [[WEIGHTLIFTING] posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/y99he/weightlifting_week_1_getting_started/)!

* Some programs that everyone seems to love: [Couch to 5K](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) (to move from no running experience to being able to run a 5K), [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_Strength_Wiki), [StrongLifts 5x5.](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/) and the [100 push up program](http://www.hundredpushups.com/).

* *Don't be afraid of the gym*. Everybody had to start somewhere and everybody is focused on their own routines. Keep going back for more and you'll see some major transformations in your body.  /r/Fitness's FAQ has [a good section on what to expect at the gym and proper etiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness#GymEtiquette).

* *Do something fun*. Go for a hike, play some basketball, go rafting, play tennis.

* Tip from andyleclair: ""If you don't have any equipment, but want to check out body weight training, [this post](http://nerdfitness.com/blog/2009/12/09/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/) on nerd fitness is a great place to start. It's a full circuit workout, and the only equipment needed is a gallon jug filled with water. There's also a nice video explaining the exercises"".

* Some free resources that one should at least skim through is the [r/fitness faq](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness) and the [brain over brawn ebook](http://brainoverbrawn.com/get-the-book/).

* Good sites to look up exercises include [ExRx](http://exrx.net/), [Bodybuilding.com (with many videos)](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/) and [workout-routine](http://www.workout-routine.com/workout-routines.html).

* If you haven't done so already, join [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/register/?invite_code=XF3Y2). It gives you a good overview on what your fellow 90DGers are doing and will allow you to join the [Round 8 Sprint 1 Challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/y6kso/fitocracy_sprint_1_challenge_information_signups/).

If you still do not have an invite, and want in, *please* post again here in this thread and/or send me a PM and I'll make sure you get your invite by tonight at the latest. First round of challenges starts tomorrow! Who's excited?!

------

Welcome back Fitocrats! Whether you're a Fitocracy veteran or a new user - Group Challenges are back and we're hoping you'll join us for the first sprint, as well as the rest of the round! For those who were with us last round, the format is almost identical - although I'm happy to report that we're now featuring a **Swimming** challenge in addition to our regular contests. Hit the pool!

Again, I'd like to thank **Feckless** for doing a wonderful job of hosting our past challenges. Hopefully I'll be able to do half the job he did! If you have any questions or spot any errors, let me know...

------------------------------

**Q. What is Fitocracy?**

A. Fitocracy is a social site where you sign up and track your workouts. You 'level up' by completing workouts, quests, and challenges. These range from something fairly simple (Go for a jog of any length) to the ridiculous (Squat twice your bodyweight for 20 reps). 

**Q. Ok, got it! Now what are groups?**

A. Groups/Challenges are a way to get people together with similar interests, and compete against one another in specific activities. For example, the Running Distance challenge only keeps track of how much you've run, and ranks you against other group members. You're still allowed to log whatever you want daily, but only running will count.

**Q. You've got me excited - now how do I *WIN*?**

A. The primary intent of these challenges is to encourage everyone to be more active, but many of us enjoy the competition and you should take great pride in finishing high in (or even winning!) a specific challenge. The way the challenges are ranked is strictly by points. When you complete an activity, fitocracy will hand you out a certain amount of points. You get more points for 'harder' activities. Running 5 miles at a 8 minute pace will get you more points than a 10 minute paces, and running 10 miles will get you more points than running 5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to join a challenge**

1) If you haven't already, **join [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com)**. Back in the day people needed invites to join Fitocracy. This does not seem to be the case anymore, if however you run into problems and can not join / need an invite message one of the mods and we will help you.

2) **Follow the user [90DaysGoalBot](http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/90DaysGoalBot/)**. This means click on the link and hit the button on the top right that says ""FOLLOW"". (If it says ""UNFOLLOW"" you are already following that user). We have to do this as there is no other way for us to add you to the challenges. Also that is a user that every mod has access to so we can add you pretty fast.

3) Tell us which challenges you want to join. Do this via the comments here. We will need your Fitocracy Username to do this. Ideally it will look something like: **""Fitocracy:[User] Challenge: a,b,d""**. An mod will answer your request here once you have been invited.

4) Check your messages on [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/notifications/) and click the invitation link. Then in the group, click the top right button that says **""JOIN GROUP""**.

5) After joining, you have to join the challenge as well. Check the left side in the group for the **""JOIN CHALLENGE""** button. I can not stress this enough. *If you want to take part you have to do this before August 20th*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If there are any questions left, we are willing to help you with every step. Problems signing up to fitocracy? Joining the group? Didn't get your invite? Let us know - don't hesitate to ask!

A reminder will be posted over the weekend for anyone who misses this post. Once we get started, we'll do results midway through the sprint and a final result at the end of the sprint.

Well, I'm feeling okay.  Some days really make you aware of your own mortality &amp; I'm kinda feeling that today.  An acquaintance that I knew passed away yesterday after her body rejected her lung transplant.  25 years old.  Kinda makes me not want to take things (like my health) for granted like I have been.  Knowing that she would have done anything to have the healthy lungs that I have makes me kinda sad.

So how did you do on your goals yesterday?  Did you meet them.

Yes (for once!), I met my goals.  Right after work, I changed clothes &amp; went running in 100 degree heat.  Not exactly ideal weather, but I made it.  Still on C25K Week 1 but Im still proud.  Afterwards, I cooked some seared ahi tuna w/ mango salsa + roasted veggies.  It came out good, so Im pleased.

Have you made your goals for today yet?  What are they?

Mine is to basically stick to my diet today.  Im taking a friend out for her birthday dinner so I just need to be mindful of my choices.  Eeeep! *fingers crossed*

How is everyone doing today? Its a Thursday and thats all I have to say about that. So last week I asked people about their sleep and some people mentioned that they needed some more and some said they get enough. 

I'm curious did anyone make any effort to sleep more over the past week? How has it helped? Has it made any difference good or bad? Do you find it hard to find time for sleep?

I didnt sleep well last night even though I got 8.5 hours. Weird how that works. I even worked out twice yesterday!

* Body weight squats
* Lunges

Try to do at least three sets of each and report on your progress as you go.  And if you can only do 1 or 2 reps, it's a great start!  You'll get better as you practice and build strength.

I hope everyone has their Sprint #2 goals set by now.  If not, it's not too late.  Take some time today to reflect upon the past 30 days and determine what you need to go differently to achieve success!

I had an excellent morning today (which is why this Daily Goal post is late).  I woke up early and had a fantastic run.  I finished B210K W5D2, which consisted of two 25 minute runs with a 1 minute walking break in the middle.  The next run is two 30 minute runs, and then it's nothing but single 60 minute runs.  Eek. 

Have fun today,

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last round we had public challenges which means that any other user on Fitocracy was able to join. We voted on that one and it was decided that this round the challenges stay private, which means, we mods have to invite you to the challenges, which means a little bit more work for you, but I am sure it just requires a few minutes of your time to join. What now follows is a detailed description of steps necessary for you to join the challenges:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to join a challenge**

1) If you haven't already, **join [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com)**. Back in the days (last round) people needed invites to join Fitocracy. This does not seem to be the case anymore, if however you run into problems and can not join / need an invite message one of the mods and we will help you.

2) **Follow the user [90DaysGoalBot](http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/90DaysGoalBot/)**. This means click on the link and hit the button on the top right that says ""FOLLOW"". (If it says ""UNFOLLOW"" you are already following that user). We have to do this as there is no other way for us to add you to the challenges. Also that is a user that every mod has access to so we can add you pretty fast.

3) Tell us which challenges you want to join. Do this via the comments here. We will need your Fitocracy Username to do this. Ideally it will look something like: **""Fitocracy:[User] Challenge: a,b,d""**. An mod will answer your request here once you have been invited.

4) Check your messages on [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/notifications/) and click the invitation link. Then in the group, click the top right button that says **""JOIN GROUP""**.

5) After joining, you have to join the challenge as well. Check the left side in the group for the **""JOIN CHALLENGE""** button. I can not stress this enough. **If you want to take part you have to do this before May 4th**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If there are any questions left, we are willing to help you with every step. Don't hesitate to ask.

How did everyone do with their Sprint 1 goals?  Success?  Not-quite-success?  

I succeeded in one of my two Sprint 1 goals.  I'm actually past week 3 of B210K, so I'm ahead of schedule!  I did not succeed in my second goal, which was to get my weight lifting back to where it was last December.  I'm still hobbled by tendonitis in both arms, though it is now much improved.

How about you?

Jordan always has the good quotes :)  &amp;he's right.  Just because you can't do something now, doesn't make it always impossible.  Improvise!  Adapt!  You'd be surprised how far the power of motivation will get you.

I always like to hear feedback, so if you feel like you are losing it or have another question, make yourself heard.

Another point that is interesting on that day is of course, ""how do I survive the weekend?"". Well how do you do it? I notice I am not really doing my best on the weekend but am going to at least drink more water and try to cut back on the unhealthy stuff. Those damn weekends.

How was yesterday? Did you reach your goals? What are your goals for today?

**Let's talk about how your week went and what you want to accomplish in the coming week.**

So far this week we've set goals, taken measurements, taken progress pictures, decided on our diet, started our fitness plans, and generally been completely awesome. Next week, it's time to get down to business and work towards those goals. How are you going to work out? How are you going to follow that diet? What about the week after that? **What's going to keep you motivated to keep going?**

For me, the motivation comes in not wanting the physical discomfort that going off my diet creates. This weekend, it's the only thing that kept me from cheating with food. I'm fine with motivation to exercise because I truly love what I am doing! I have found that is is key to enjoy it a bit or I'll never stick to it.

So, 90DG'ers, are you ready for tomorrow's check-in? I'm excited that we have so many of you participating. I can't wait to see each and every one of you reach your goals!

Have a great day everyone!!

Recently I was browsing Reddit and came upon [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/srpw3/documented_one_arm_handstand_pushup/) about a one arm handstand pushup and whether it had ever been done (or if it had, was there evidence of it) and I was fascinated! I was also motivated to be able to do it and the mechanics behind it. I'm going to make that a goal for someday :D

Did you reach the goals you set for yourself yesterday? Have you set any goals for today?

Let's talk inspiration!

**Who or what is inspiring you on your fitness journey?**

Personally, I am doing this for my 3 year old daughter. She's very active and, more than anything, I want to be able to keep up with her as she gets older and more involved in sports. I am also doing this for myself, to prove I can and to see if I can finally feel good about how I look. I got tired of hating myself and decided to change it. My health also plays into it, as I have Fibromyalgia (newly diagnosed) and am looking to keep the pain away for as long as I can.

The image that inspires me the most is [this unknown woman](http://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/hot-fit-girls-26.jpg). She has the body I am striving for and I look at it every single day to remind myself what I am working towards. I also watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loszrEZvS_k) every day, as I plan to be able to do that routine some day.

So, there you have it! Let's hear what inspires you!

Round 6 Goals:

* Lose 16 pounds

* Run longer/faster


Accomplishments:

* Lost 16 pounds (151 lbs - 134.8 lbs)

* Achieved my ideal goal weight (under 135 lbs)

* Ran 9 miles at a time (longest before this round was ~6)

* Ran a 5k in under 27 min (longest before this round was ~28 min)

* Ran 2 miles non-stop at 8 min pace


I tried to keep to around 1500 calories a day, using myfitnesspal (I did not eat back my calories from exercising), but did not stick to any specific diet.  I also exercised, a lot, like at least 6 days a week.  I am training for a half-marathon in May, so that helped the motivation.  Anything else you want to know, ask!

I'm trying to keep that kind of mindset.  Because I was SUPPOSED to go back Crossfit last week BUT $$.  So it's ""Take 2"" is this week.  I really just need to hit my stride &amp; run w/ it.  But we'll see.

Is there anything that's not working super well for you? Are there any modifications to your plans you can make that would make the difference for you in achieving your goals this round?

For me, I think I met the biggest goal I had for myself so far this round: I have a new job and I'm starting on the 26th. YAY! I cannot tell you how AMAZING it felt to give my 2 weeks notice and my last day at the current position is Tuesday next week. Woo hoo! I realize this is not a fitness or diet plan goal but LET ME TELL YOU just how deeply this was a goal toward my health for the sheer volume of stress the current position was placing on me. I was getting sick way more often than anyone should who is eating as healthfully as I have been (since the start of round 5 which was my goal that round, yay!) and the blow to my mental health alone. Whoo you have no idea what a relief this is for me. :D Plus the large bump in salary is going to fund my exercise goals as well: I should finally be able to afford a gym membership at a really decent gym of my choice! I'm excited. :D

I hope you all have a spectacular weekend! I know I will. :D

How was yesterday? Did you reach your goals? What are your goals for today?

Let's talk about giving up and what to do to stop it. What do you do when you just don't feeling like eating right anymore, or sticking to a particular diet or exercise? Do you have a support system in place, or a certain person you lean on for support?

Personally, I am PMS'ing like a mofo and I've cheated on my diet a bunch this week. I tried reaching out to a set of people but I was basically told that excuses are like assholes... that really pissed me off and I shut myself off from everyone. Is it so bad that even I need a little hand holding once in awhile?

Have a great day everyone and, as always, don't forget to support your fellow 90DG'ers!

Not so well for me in terms of diet, as I overate as well as had a bowl of cereal and a banana. Not allowed when you're on keto. We'll see how long it takes for me to get back into ketosis! I also didn't do any exercise. I did have an enjoyable day though, so it's not all bad!

Today's goals are to get caught up with commenting &amp; posting here, clean my house, and hopefully get a workout in!

**Say one positive thing about yourself** (It doesn't have to about fitness, or 90daysgoal, it just has to be positive.)

* Women Losing Weight - posted every day, with daily discussion topics. [You can submit a discussion topic idea here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&amp;formkey=dExRVkRGazJVeFhEaHJMdWJ1TXZpbmc6MQ#gid=0)

[**If you want to take part in these challenges, you have to sign up for the team *and* join the challenge by January 18**](http://redd.it/oba50).

You can join these any time throughout the round.

* Paleo - If you are working on your diet and using the paleo method feel free to post recipes, ideas and tips for sticking to it!

* Motivation - We all get a little down and have a hard time keeping it together. Let us know how to stay motivated.

* Food - Share your recipes and good food!

* Vegetarian/vegan - It may be hard to find the right foods and tactics to stick to this diet. Find help here.

* Keto - Carbs are pretty evil. Find ways to hate on them with people who also hate them!

* FitGaming - Do you have a gaming console and a fitness/dance game? Join us this weekend as we debut [FitGaming]!

* Couch to 5K - posted weekly, princessbitchtits and katiekatums will be running through the [Couch to 5K](http://c25k.com/) program and we're hoping we'll have a big group running along with us. There will be a post with details on Sunday.

I can't believe 90 days have past already! Since everyone is posting their final progress for this round, I guess I will do so as well! Everyone's posts are so inspiring!

Anyway, I started at 202 and finished at 179.  Total loss was 23 pounds!  My 90 day goal was to lose 15 pounds so I am very proud to have gone past my goal!
I am a 5'7"" female.  I originally started by weight loss journey in March of 2011.  I was 222 at that point and really tired of looking at pictures of myself and feeling ashamed. So my total weight loss since march has been 43 pounds!  
I have also lost a few pant sizes.  I have gone from a size 16 to a size 11-12. I am THRILLED by this! My goal weight is somewhere between 150-160.  I plan on getting getting down to around 150 then shifting my workout balance to more weightlifting and less cardio to gain some muscle.  

I am looking forward to the next round where I hope to achieve my goal weight!

For diet, I've limited my intake, but the holiday treats have been hard to avoid - especially the alcohol!

As for exercise, I'm really proud of my work in c25k, and I plan to complete the challenge in February. I have not kept up with my body weight exercises as well as I should. My biggest improvement was in being able to do 20 squats in a row, but I still don't do squats regularly =/

I started round 5 at about 200 lbs, and I'm currently about 194lbs. I missed my goal by 9 lbs, but it wasn't a total loss - just a slow start as I tried to create news habit. Not to mention that halfway through the round, I fell down a flight of stairs and had a giant black bruise on my butt, and a lot of sore spots on my legs. I still feel some pain 2 months later.. it seriously slowed me down.

* The Unofficial Challenge of Awesomeness has begun! See how long you can last and post your times in [pfftwanker's thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/mig2y/challenge_the_unofficial_challenge_of_awesomeness/).

And with that, let's hear your daily goals! How has the round gone for you so far? How did last week turn out? A lot of us are probably going to face some big Thanksgiving meals this week. What are your plans? Any tips for staying active when you're traveling for the holidays? Or eating right when you're surrounded by food?

Good luck and stay strong this week!

It is I, your interim Motivation Team leader, Vampire_Kitty. :D *cue dramatic music and maybe a waving flag in the background or something* heh

But seriously, this team was going to be awesome and then something happened to the leader, we don't know what, and since I'm on this subreddit daily already and enjoy motivating people and encouraging goals, here I am for the rest of the round to keep things interesting. :)

SOooooooo... what I need to know from all of you is this: What would you like from this team? Right now you have the opportunity for a brand new fresh start with fresh leader blood (muahahaahaaaa) at a time when motivation is probably starting to waver - mid way through the round, about ready to say fuckitall and give up, and holy shit the holidays are just around the corner! NOW is the time for some motivation! :D

So, give me ALL the suggestions! *holds up a broom* What would make this team awesome for you? What motivates you? What format would you like this team to take for the rest of the round? What would you like from me as a leader?

I've got some ideas but I need YOUR input since, you know, it's YOUR team and I'm just sorta stepping in cuz, well, I'm here all the time anyway. :D 

Ideas that I have: we could turn this into kind of a blog of posts where people can just sort of yammer about what's going on in their lives and we can all be supportive of each other and keep that communication and interest in this team going - sometimes all it takes to keep motivation going is just knowing someone is THERE. 

Other ideas, having someone to keep you in check! Want to post a small goal you have for the next day or the next week and have me check in with you to hold you accountable to doing what you said you would do? I'm there! 

Another idea is that we could have a meta-discussion about motivation, what motivates people, what motivates us each individually, and maybe come up with some ideas (even if just through trial and error) to get the structures in place to keep us honoring our commitments to ourselves.

Anyway, let me know what works for YOU, what you want from this team, and how I can assist you in achieving that and we'll go from there. :)",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,gold5,True,t3_mhqnf,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/mhqnf/motivation_reviving_the_motivation_team_for_round/,

Buah another day of me doing nothing and another day of my leg healing I hope. Damn, I am getting old. It was mostly a wasted day, played a game (Ninja Blade) from my birthday pile and could just play 1 hour. Not really a gamer anymore it seems. Almost weekend although this kind of sucks. To explain, my colleague is in his holidays and he has left me with some nasty customer problems so I am feeling pushed. Having stuff that needs to be finished and having to nurse some customers. This always sucks. I feel like I am extinguishing fires, carefully selecting which one is the biggest atm. Our chief programmer feels the same way. Man if our customers want something new I have to set the date for the programs to next year already. Too much to be done, not enough time.

Anyhow maybe I need to take a walk while I am not working out. This sitting on my bud all evening is making me sad. I guess you get a certain high from training.

As for a topic, I thought we'd talk about **sugar and sugar substitutes**. Basically - do you stay away from sugar completely or do it in moderation? Do you replace it, instead, with natural alternatives like [Stevia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevia) or [Xylitol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylitol) or (the not-really-natural-but-made-from-sugar) [Splenda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenda). Do you aim for a slightly healthier affect on your glycemic index with something like [Agave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agave_nectar)? Or do you go all out and seek the artificial sugars like [Aspartame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartame)? There's not a right or wrong answer, it's really about what works for you, but I think it's interesting to see why people have picked certain options - information is great! 

For myself...well, I'm trying really hard to stick to this paleo thing so I'm really trying to stay away from all sweeteners completely. It's made pretty helpful for me by the fact that I really can't eat most artificial sweeteners - I think they taste terrible. This includes stevia (which makes my mouth water in this gross metallic way), aspartame, and Splenda (although it's the best of the bunch). Where do you ladies stand?

It's been a week since my first post and what a week it's been! I hope you are all doing well and I also hope that you all have checked in like you're supposed to!

I'm here today to talk to you about stress. Stress is unavoidable in college. It's impossible to not be stressed out, no matter how hard you try. Big test coming up? Stress. Date with some new guy or gal? Stress. Maintaining a diet and exercise program while keeping up with your school work and social life? Stress, stress, stress.

Stress is too broad of a term though. As many of you may know, there are two major types of stress - distress and eustress. Distress is any kind of stress that is borne of a negative situation. Eustress is a positive stress arising from good situations. If you're nervous about an exam coming up, then you're experience distress; however, if you get a good grade on that exam, then you may experience eustress. Both types of stress are necessary for you to maintain a proper demeanor and mindset, but too much of either can cause problems too.

Now that we know what stress is and that it's unavoidable, the only thing left to discuss is stress management. There are a handful of ways to manage stress. Many people enjoy relaxing, meditation, sleeping, and other passive ways to relieve stress. Others prefer to exercise, hang out with friends, or some other more active way to relive stress. Also, some people prefer to relieve stress through smoking, alcohol use, or drug use (none of which I condone).

What you choose to do to relive your own stress is your prerogative, but it is absolutely necessary you let off some steam every once and a while. Are you a runner under a lot of stress? Add a few extra miles to your next run. Are you buzzing around all day long, but just need some to sit? Kick off those shoes and sit! Everybody has their own ways to relieve stress and it is important to do so.

This week's discussion topic for the Runners group is *proper breathing technique and how to avoid side stitches*.

Portions are from [Dave Elger](http://daveelger.articlesbase.com/sports-and-fitness-articles/improve-your-running-with-proper-breathing-45455.html) and [Chi Running](http://www.chirunning.com/chi-library/article/breathe-easy/).

*****
**The Problem of Shallow Breathing**

The most important thing to remember about breathing while running is that you are trying to get as much oxygen into your system, while getting rid of the waste (CO2).  As you become a more seasoned runner, your body will adjust to make this process more efficient.  If you are a beginner, it is important to remember to breathe as deeply as possible.  

Many runners will do *shallow breathing*, in which you only breathe into the top parts of your lungs, which do not contain the alveoli which exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen.  This will result in not enough oxygen being absorbed into your body.  It can also stimulate your ""fight or flight"" response, resulting in increased heart rate, and the release of stress hormones like cortisol.  This causes the body to burn blood sugar and store fat and raises blood pressure as a result of lower oxygenation rates, which ultimately overloads the adrenal glands.

**Belly Breathing**

One useful technique to master is *belly breathing*, and from personal experience, it works wonders.  It results in the release of a beneficial cocktail of hormones (namely serotonin and beta-endorphin), lowering your heart rate and blood pressure, improving circulation, and producing an overall calming effect and feeling of well-being.

Place your hands over your belly button. Now purse your lips like you're trying to blow a candle out and exhale, emptying your lungs by pulling in your belly button towards your spine. After you've blown out as much air as you can, just relax your belly and the inhale will take place on its own. Practice breathing this way when you're not running so that you can learn the technique while under any physical duress. Then, once you get comfortable with belly breathing you can introduce it into your running.  The main thing to remember is to fully empty your lungs before inhaling again.

**Proper Posture Works Wonders**

Many runners will tend to slouch as they get tired, bending forward at the waist, with shoulders and upper back moving forward.  When your body moves into this position, it is much more difficult to breath deeply.  Slouching is often the result of a generally weak core, and core exercises like planks, crunches, and hip bridges will help immensely \(Runner's World has a [great set of core workout videos](http://goo.gl/nRTN9)\).

When you catch yourself slouching, be sure to stand tall, move your shoulders back, tighten your core, and stretch your abdomen up by taking one hand and pushing down at your belly button while the other hand pushes up on your rib cage.

**Relax!**

This is related to slouching.  If you notice your body tensing up, you could be tightening your muscles, resulting in lower blood flow into oxygen-deprived muscle tissue.

The cure for this is easy - *simply relax*.  Drop your shoulders, shake out your hands, and try to ""float"" as opposed to clomping your way down the road.

**Cadence and Side Stitches**

Runners should be inhaling and exhaling through both nose AND mouth to a set pattern or rhythm. Most elite runners breathe to a 2-2 rhythm. They breathe in while taking 2 steps and out while taking 2 steps.

i.e. Left foot- begin exhale, Right foot- continue exhale, Left foot- begin inhale, Right foot- continue inhale

One problem with this approach is the habit of always inhaling or exhaling on the same footfall, which some experts believe could lead to *side stitches*. If you are one of those unfortunate runners prone to side aches, try periodically switching which footfall you exhale on, or even change your breathing rhythm to exhale on alternating right and left footfalls, using a 3-2 rhythm:

i.e. Left foot- begin inhale, Right foot- continue inhale, Left foot- begin exhale, Right foot- continue exhale, Left foot - continue exhale, Right foot- begin inhale ",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,self7,True,t3_l03hw,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/l03hw/runners_topic_breathing_and_side_stitches/,

OK, slight exaggeration! It was flippin' tough though! I felt like my lungs were bleeding, my gums were throbbing(?!) and I could feel my mouth watering like I was going to throw up. But I did the whole session! 

I have to say, I've had an iPhone for over 2 years (on my second one now) and I really appreciated it today. I was able to run my iPod and Runkeeper app together and then open up my C25K app at the same time. When I got home I also updated my fitocracy profile (directly from Runkeeper) and my Live Strong account. That sounds like a lot of trackers, but I like feeling that I'm being held accountable to various people/systems. It's even better that I don't know any of these people!

I wasn't great at tracking calories all of last week, and I didn't really do any exercise. I decided it was pointless trying to do everything at once. Still managed to lose 1.4lbs though! Not bad!!

This week is the beginning of C25K and calorie tracking and next week I'm going to get back to the gym and start on some weights.

My mom is having a heart procedure at the hospital as we speak (about to leave to go see her), my elderly grandfather isn't doing well, work is frustrating, and I think it hit me today just how big I've let myself get. All very discouraging.

Mostly I'm posting to tell the universe that I WILL exercise tonight and I will feel good about it! I know we all have those days when life just feels crappy and the last thing we want to do is motivate ourselves. So reddit, if you are feeling like me at all today, time to tell those voices in your head to GO SUCK IT! Am I right?

tl;dr - I feel like crap today but am posting to hold myself accountable for both getting in some exercise and thinking positive thoughts instead of negative ones.

Starting next week, we will have a post every Tuesday for us to talk about our walking/jogging/running progress over the past week, our plans for the upcoming week, and any questions that might come up (shin splints, blisters, podcasts, etc.). All levels of runners are welcome and encouraged to participate in the discussion.

Mr_Nox and I will be co-captaining the team, making sure that there is always a Tuesday post for discussion. If the Tuesday post is ever missing, feel free to nudge us through PMs. That said, everyone is welcome to post [runners] posts any time a running-related question comes up or if you find some helpful tips that you'd like to share. 

Since team posts don't always make it to the front page, I'd be happy to send out an email on Tuesdays with links to the latest discussion post and all of the [runners] posts that pop up over the week. If you're interested, please PM me your email address. The addresses will only be seen by myself and Mr_Nox and all emails will be sent bcc, so your address won't be passed around to everyone. :)

###Running programs

If you're not sure where to start, there are some great options out there to help you on your way:

* [**Couch to 5K (C25K)**](http://www.c25k.com) is a great program to take you from absolutely no experience all the way to completing a full 5km run. Lots of 90ers are following or have already completed the Couch to 5K program and there are a lot of great apps, podcasts, infographics and other things out there to help you along. If you're not sure what program to choose, I would highly recommend you start here first. If it's too easy or too hard, you can try moving to one of the other programs below.

* [**Conservative Couch to 5K**](http://www.beginnertriathlete.com/Programs/conservative_program.htm) takes you from absolutely no experience to completing a full 5km run using a slower progression than the C25K program. The first month of the program is entirely walking, so if you don't think you're ready to jump straight into jogging, this might be a good stepping stone.

* [**Bridge to 10K**](http://blog.c25kapp.com/about-bridge-to-10k/) is intended to take you from 5K to 10K runs. It's a great extension for C25K graduates.

* [**Podrunner Intervals**](http://www.djsteveboy.com/intervals.html) have some great podcasts to get you running 5K, 8K, or 10K distances.

* **Hal Higdon** has [5K](http://www.halhigdon.com/5K%20Training/index.htm), [10K](http://www.halhigdon.com/10ktraining/10kintro.htm), [half-marathon](http://www.halhigdon.com/halfmarathon/index.htm), and [marathon](http://www.halhigdon.com/marathon/Mar00index.htm) training programs, to name [just a few](http://www.halhigdon.com/).

* **Chi Running** has [training programs](http://www.chirunning.com/learn-it/training-programs/) for 5K, 10K, half- and full-marathons.  The [Chi Running](http://www.chirunning.com/what-is-chirunning/) technique promotes pain-free running via proper posture and technique, and is great for beginners as well as experienced runners.

***
Since we're just starting the round, this is a great time to read through the different programs and pick one that fits your needs. Most of these programs are intended for 3 runs per week, and the chances are good that a large set of us will be running on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. If you haven't started running yet, pick out your program and plan to start running on Monday! (Or start even sooner, why wait?) On Tuesday, we'll have our first check-in post to talk about our early progress and plans for the rest of the round.

In 5 weeks, I lost only 1 kg (+- 2 lbs). Not good for my motivation, as I was working out AND eating well. So for everyone who feels the same: see if cm's (or inches) are coming off!

My trainer told me this is pretty common with people who start working out: the fat goes away and the muscles grow. As they are heavier than fat, you won't lose much weight (maybe even gain some), but you do get stronger and slimmer. To confirm this, I started measuring last week. My results of one week:

waist - 3 cm

hip -1 cm

thigh -1 cm

In one week!! So something's definetely happening!!

So I've been working at a health food store for five+ years now and I thought it'd be fun to compile a list of helpful hints and tips for everyone trying to eat healthier.  Some things that are now part of my daily life and eating routine are completely unknown to others, and I have to remind myself that not everyone is so exposed to the health food world.

Things I am going to touch on include yogurt (how good is it/added sugar or no/Activia is marketing bullcrap), the best diet soda (and more on artificial sweeteners/zero-calorie things), the best protein drinks and bars I've found, and some tasty low-calorie and healthy snacks, and other great alternatives.

This has been a difficult week for me, and yet somehow it also felt like it went by fast.

We've been working hard for two weeks.  We're probably feeling entitled to a cheat, or that we deserve a reward for our efforts.  Either that, or maybe we're frustrated that we haven't stuck to it as we wished we had, and we're on the brink of abandoning this ""silly"" 90 day idea.

Don't cave in!  It gets easier with time as our resolve helps us build better habits.  What is work for us today will be habits tomorrow if we stick to it.  If we regress now, we're not respecting ourselves for all of the hard work that we've put in.

Now is the time to be strong!

But it is hard.  If you've been fighting cravings, what have you been doing to combat them?  If you haven't, it is the prepared that succeed, so what is your plan should they appear?

My way...  Whenever I'm on the brink of faltering, I make a change at that moment!  The change of venue or activity gives me strength and proves to myself that I'm in control!  Maybe I can't control my body's unhealthy craving, but I can control feet and walk away!  If it's ice cream I want, a walk in the park is a good strategy.  No ice cream there!  What I've found is that after a short time, those cravings pass, and then I feel great!

A lot of people chicken out on it, it is such a HUGE step up to consolidate all the runs into one.  

The way I understand it, is you used to be really fit, and are trying to get back into it.  Certainly you lift harder weights than I can even get close to!  And I, for almost 20 years of adult life, have never been fit.  And I've never run before, having always had shin splints and not enough stamina to run very far before pain and stitches made me stop.

Well, I just did W5D3.  All the way through.  First time.  

My legs don't feel like my own - partly because they're almost numb now, but that they could just keep going, and going...  I told myself I'd do 20 minutes in 2 goes, with a 5 minute gap when I had had enough.  I would try to hit 10 minutes minimum.

8 minutes comes and goes, what I'd already done from W5D2.  Felt it, but was okay, thought I could reach 10m.

10 minutes.  C25K app announces it's halfway!  I feel I can do more.  And whatever I do now, I don't have to do after the break, right?  Try to get to 12, to leave 8 afterwards.  I've done 8m before.

12 minutes rolls up.  Feel I have a bit left in the tank, though sweat is now stinging my eyes.  No stitch.  Aim for 15 minutes.  Castles in the Sky by Ian van Dahl comes on, and somehow propels me for another 3 minutes.  That will be a special song from now on!

15 minutes.  Tell myself if I make it to 17, I'll just stop - no need to break for 5 mins then jog for 3.  

17,  18,  2 to go, can't fail now.  19, it's tough.  And 20.  It came up, I couldn't believe it.  I almost couldn't stop running, my legs went all funny when I tried to change the motion!  But I did it.  I know you can too.

(Sorry to wax lyrical, this is a big accomplishment for me! :) )

So the challenge is on.  I know you're worried about W5D3, but it's doable, and I want you to give it a good shot.  You're my running buddy now, mate!

about me, well, workout wise it was very well as usual. The whole week even, I improved almost every exercise I do. My problem lies with the food. Now I am not trying to loose weight, but still want to have a low calorie deficit and somehow I am slacking a bit in that department. Saturday in itself wasn't that bad. Knewing about my uncle's birthday diner I ate less than usual. We were walking a lot watching a Karneval parade in the blistering cold (Laura loved the tractors), but ehn the evening came. It was a fun evening. My uncle renovated an old pinball machine and Laura was totally amazed by that machine. I wasn't even drinking that much booze, but food wise....disaster. My mother made au gratin, my sister made desert out of sugar, cream, baiser and strawberries and they had those alcohol filled chocolate candies...all very taste and I am sure I overshot my calorie goal by a mile.

Sunday is time to make up for this, so I declared Sunday cottage cheese day. Training was also good, thanks to a tip I got the chin-up workout with assists did really kill me. My arms feel like they are made of steel right now. Oh I also tried to create a spicy cottage cheese meal.....but that went horribly horribly wrong.

I found this subreddit while lurking around r/fitness. I turned 25 a few months ago and a switch flipped somewhere and I started worrying about my health. My biggest challenge is that I'm ADHD (just like 90% of everyone on Reddit? :-P) so I have had a hard time sticking with any sort of routine. It looks like 90 Days Goal is an awesome place and I look forward to us pushing each other to accomplish our goals!

And now what sort of intro would this be if it didn't include pictures? So here's the Imgur album -&gt; [front](http://imgur.com/a/nOMOd#LXDMd), [back](http://imgur.com/a/nOMOd#SlcuT), [side](http://imgur.com/a/nOMOd#kxPjF), [flex(lol)](http://imgur.com/a/nOMOd#8Q0Vl) --nsfw? (me in boxers)

I'm a programmer/computer geek so as you can guess I spend 12+ hours a day sitting in front of a computer. I'm hoping to change this as it's really bad for me. (I'm thinking of building a treadmill desk - because it's going to be hard to get me away from the computer :-P)

As a challenge to myself I started recording all of my exercise and everything I eat around the end of January. It kept me on track at first but I've obviously let myself slip. I'm going to be sharing this data with 90DG to embarrass myself into correcting my habits. Here are the logs from 1/28 up to 3/3: [food log](http://pastebin.com/hBwesdW7), [exercise log](http://pastebin.com/jw5vVePz). If you have any critiques/suggestions/jokes let me know. (yes, i actually own a scale that gets used for food only. it still seems weird to me :-P)


I have no clue what my goals should be. These are too broad but at the highest overview I need to get my diet straightened out, stop eating fast food, and make a real plan for the gym.

Anyway it's getting late so I'm going to get to sleep. See everyone tomorrow!

I have no idea what IF is like or how to improve your bench press performance, but we do have lots of experts on this site who could answer these questions easily. There are people who have already lost 100+ lbs, people who have added lots of muscle, people who rock climb, run, and swim, and followers of all types of diets. These guys and gals would probably be able to answer the more obscure questions or give a good resource to read about it, but they might not have the time to read through every post every day.

What I would like to do here is to let everyone sign up for their area of expertise. If you feel like you could answer a question about any of the subjects in the comments below, please respond to that comment to sign up as an ""expert."" This will be a list that the mods (and anyone else) can come to if they see a question that hasn't received a good answer. I don't know how everyone will use this list, but here are the two scenarios I picture: 1) The mods see a question that has been up for a while with few or no responses. They aren't able to answer it themselves, so they PM you a link to see if you can help out. 2) Someone has a question that they don't want to post publicly, so they PM it to someone on this list.

If you think you can help out, please sign up! If you know a thing or two about a topic that I didn't include, please add it and then sign up under your own comment. If you want to see a topic here, but you aren't an expert, please add it so that others can sign up.

**edit:** A couple extra notes: 

To anyone thinking about signing up here: You don't have to be a real, certified expert in these categories. Just have some experience and knowledge that you're willing to share. If you *are* a real, certified expert, that's even better. Personal trainers, coaches, and dietitians would be great :)

To anyone looking for advice from someone on these lists: These aren't necessarily real, certified experts. Hopefully you can get some helpful advice here, but it's also a good idea to ask your doctor, dietitian, personal trainer, or coach!

My 25th birthday is coming up in May so that's some pretty good motivation right there. 

My main goal is to just get healthier and in better shape and lose ~~some~~ most of the jiggle. 

The hardest thing for me is going to be my diet, I just got back to the US after being abroad for a year and I just want to go out and stuff myself with all the food I missed. I also didn't have an oven for a year and I love to bake so I've been on a baking rampage since I got back, bread, cakes, cookies. Must. stop. now. &gt;_&lt;

You have to have a clear goal in mind. Something ambitious, but within reach, and clear.
When you have decided what your goals should be, short-term, long-term, remember to write them down and try to keep them on you.

For Round#1, I didn't think very much about goal setting. But doing as I was told, I decided that I would at least make up one goal, and I would write it down on a piece of paper. My goal was to get under 220lbs. This number makes more sense if you are metric, it means that you can write your weight with two digits, instead of three (&lt; 100kg) :-)

Anyway,

I took a yellow post-it note, and wrote on it ""99"". To keep my mind set on this goal, I then put the post-it note into my wallet, next to my credit card.
Seeing just a corner of that yellow paper sticking out each time I opened up my wallet was definitely a great reminder (conscious and subconscious) and in the end of Round#1 I was exactly there.

Ive tried using an alarm clock for my workout with P90X, I refuse to give up my beer (I only have maybe 3 a week) and coffee, and I only eat once a day because honestly I don't really care to eat even though I LOVE FOOD!

Your typical boneless breast has 269 calories, with 50 grams of protein, 6 grams of fat, and 0 carbohydrates. 
873 mg potassium, but also 274 mg sodium, and 496 mg phosphorus.

I like it grilled, but the grillmaster hates to fire up the grill for just a little chicken.  
So our 'go-to' way to fix it is just to cook in a wearever skillet (kind of a pressure cooker) with olive oil.  Sprinkle with garlic powder, onion powder, and an herb mix of some kind, I think Mrs. dash garlic and herb is one.  If you are using a standard skillet, you're probably going to need to add some liquid at some point: white wine, vermouth, broth, or even water.

When there's time to fire up the oven, put some olive oil in a bowl (2T I guess) and doctor the oil with marjoram, black pepper, thyme, and rosemary.   Roll each breast around in the oil and lay on a broiler pan, with some water in the bottom tray of the pan.   Roast either slow at 350 til tender, or as high as 425 to speed up the process (but you better have water in that pan or you'll see a lot of smoke in the kitchen).    This way is nice if you want to bake some potatoes or roast some veggies at the same time.

Anyway, how do YOU like chicken?

The impetus for doing this, if anyone is interested, was shaving off the beard I'd had for 3 years.  A beard can hide a multitude of sins - and chins for that matter!

Some stats on me, I'm 36, 6'4 / 1m93, and had just nudged 100kg / 220lb.  I was always skinny when I was younger, typically non-athletic computer nerd, but over time I just gained weight slowly, maybe 4kg a year for 10 years.  I know I weighed 85kg in early 2007.  I didn't do any exercise, and ate whatever I liked.  I'd had terrible luck at the gym as aside from a belly, I *look* like I'm in good shape - well-defined arms and legs.  Personal Trainers gave me way too much to do, I couldn't nearly keep up and always bailed out.  My heart rate would spike up to 170 or 180 even doing light stuff, some trainers actually got very worried about this, but doctor said I was fine.

So my goals were (not specifically for 2 months)

* lose some weight, I wanted to hit 200, then 180 lbs.  
* Increase my endurance, so I could do exercise without killing myself.
* Change my lifestyle into something more healthy.

I got hold of P90X, had a look at the videos and just went ashen.  I couldn't even start to do that.  So I found another set, the ""Slim series"" by beachbody.  Even though that was still above me, it gave me something to work towards.  I started with the ""cooldown"" stretching workout, I couldn't even finish that!  2 weeks later, I was doing the regular workouts, with short breaks, and could do the cooldown without breaking a sweat.  I continued like this for a month, then in preparation for moving house, stopped exercise.  I've recently restarted, I'm starting c25k.  I've always had terrible shinsplints, but I'm finding the stretching and warmup I now do helps with that.

At the same time, I changed my diet.  I followed a few simple rules:

* No more crap.  At all.  This means sugary drinks or snacks, chocolate, cakes, crisps, alcohol (though I never was much of a drinker), fried or deepfried foods, mayonnaise, high fat dairy (including stuff like pizza)
* Moderate carb intake.  Don't eat pasta every day.  Switch to brown bread where possible.  Don't eat sandwiches all the time.  Don't overdo it with fruit, even.
* Increase lean protein intake.  Have grilled meat and fish, eggs.
* Never go hungry.  Always eat as much as you want.  As long as it's healthy stuff, the calories will work themselves out.  I knew if I went hungry, I'd lose my willpower in 10 minutes.

Here is a chart of my weight, and my net calories: http://i.imgur.com/dhC48.png

Aside from my body trolling me the last week and refusing to lose that last pound, I'd say mission accomplished, I'm at 200 pounds, with slow, gradual weight loss.  My net calories have trended upwards since the end of january, that is when I was moving house and getting settled in.  Even though it's ""noisy"" recently, I am still way under my calorie goals - which to lose 1lb a week, is 2050 a day.  I'm averaging about 1500, which I'm happy with.

How about results?  I've taken some photos, but I can't really tell the difference.  However, I've gone down 2 notches on my belt, and clothes are looser.  My strength has not increased, but my endurance has, which is more important (and gives me the capacity to work on the strength).  I also fit into suits from 3 years ago that I couldn't wear anymore :)  So I feel this is a good foundation, I just have to keep at it.

So what do I want to do for Round 3?  Well, I'm going to keep eating the way I do, as that seems most important for weight loss.  I want to step up my exercise again, by continuing c25k, and the weight machines I have access to (new block of flats has a gym :) ). I want to increase my strength, and my endurance to be able to do more at the end of the 3 months.  

Enough messing about, here are absolute goals for me for the end of round 3:

* Reach 185 lbs
* Carry on c25k.  Reach at least week 6 level of workout.  Fwiw, I currently do 3.5mph walk / 5.5mph jog.
* Increase my pec dec/seated chest press (I've not done them before so not sure what to expect.  They are currently 50lbs each, very low I know)
* Be cycling to work at least once per week.
* Be fit enough to pass the P90X basic fitness test.  I plan to do P90X in Round 4.

So, 5 goals.  I want to achieve at least 4 of them.  So here we go!  The gauntlet is thrown.  I may need some help, hope you're with me :)

A large one runs 33 calories.

Important nutrients:  potassium 287 mg, Vitamin C 132 mg, Vitamin A 607 IU.  And other good stuff like lycopene and beta-carotene.

I cut 'em up weird.  Stand it upright, trim off about a fourth of it at at time by cutting under the shoulder and then down and around, avoiding the inner seed core.  Kind of like taking the rind off a pineapple.   Why?  Because I hate just cutting the core out, and then trying to pick out the blasted seeds which scatter everywhere.

I like them sliced up for a fajita-type stirfry with onions and meat and picante sauce.

I like them sliced up raw and used as a crudite with a dip.  In a brown bag lunch, don't wait for a party.

I like them in red beans and rice but that's not On The Plan so never mind.

I like that they're easy to grow in a hot summer.

Dinner was simple--turkey pitas.  I stuffed two thin slices of turkey in a pita with tomatoes, carmelized onions and spinach.  I popped them in the oven til they got a bit crispy and immediately threw in a pinch of low fat mozzarella cheese &amp; diced avocado.  I then thickly sliced some cucumbers into coins to replicate chips and had that w/ some pico de gallo.  Today is our dreaded Thanksgiving luncheon--gravy, pie, and more pie!  I brought an extra pita pocket and will use some of the turkey for my lunch.  But that's all Im getting outta that lol.

How are you doing?

As you all know, there are times we get hungry and need a snack. For me, it seemed like I was snacking all day Sunday after my run. My cue that I needed good was that my head was feeling 'fuzzy' and I find myself getting irritated quickly.

So what do you do to have a healthy snack? My approach is to have some pre-portioned snacks ready. Almonds. Walnuts. Graham wafers. Pita chips and salsa. Dried fruit. Beef jerky.

Because they are already portioned, I am not tempted to eat more than planned. And because I have them ready I'm less likely to grab some cookies or ice cream.

As you may have noticed, this is coming out on Wednesday instead of Tuesday.  Last night I was sampling the new wine I had bottled, and well, it **was** tasty...  So much so that I didn’t get this ready yesterday.

You would think that would lead into a topic about ‘healthy’ cheat foods.  And you’d be wrong!  Today we’re going to talk about cooking for small groups of people - one or two.

Obviously there are challenges when you’re cooking for one.  Recipes are typically scaled for 6 to 8 people, groceries are packaged for larger groups, and you typically pay a premium price for smaller portioned groceries.  So you have to make choices about getting smaller, more expensive ingredients, or larger portioned, with the risk that they’ll go bad before you use them up.  

For some ingredients, going to a bulk food store can actually be your friend.  Most people look at bulk foods as a place to buy large portions of spices, flour, and other non-perishables.  But, you get to select your amount.  Nothing says you **need* to buy a large portion...  You can buy the amount you need instead of buying a prepackaged amount in the grocery store.

When you cook, you need to make the decision about whether you make a normal sized portion, and either eat it for a week (or freeze the remainder), or whether you eat larger portions than you probably need to make it go faster, or whether you end up throwing away the left overs.  You can attempt to scale the recipe down, but that doesn’t work for everything, so you may find that you can’t make some meals that you enjoy. And sometimes there is no option about scaling a recipe down.  Its hard to find a ‘small’ turkey...

Another strategy can be to try to plan your meals to use up the leftovers in successive meals.  For instance, if you cook a small ham, you could make a ham pasta dish the next day, ham omelette, etc.  

One key thing when cooking for one or two people is planning.  If you want to minimize your food expense and wasted food, you will need to plan your meals in advance.  There are lots of sites out there, such as http://resourcefulcook.com/mealplans/browse/forone or a http://pinterest.com/sallystrove/cooking-for-one/ that can help develop a meal plan for one person.

Anything interesting on the schedule for this week?  Noticing any progress?


This week’s topic is **how you fuel your body**.  Nutrition definitely plays a big role in performance and a lot of you mentioned it as something you’d like to see a thread about, so here we go!.  A lot of us are also on different diets - paleo, keto, vegetarian, vegan, and various non-name-having “diets” - so I thought it would be interesting for us all to discuss how we feel our own, personal, diets impact our running.  A lot of us also may have changed our diets over the span of our running careers, so maybe you noticed a change in your performance accompanying a change in diet.


**What diet is optimal for a runner?**  Well, a lot of that is dependent on you and your body and how *you* perform best.  Some people prefer low-carb diets like paleo or keto, but others follow a diet that has them eating a higher amount of carbs. Ultimately, you need to find what works for you and check in with yourself to see how your body responds and performs in reaction to what you’re eating - if you’re having trouble figuring it out, then I would suggest maybe keeping a food diary where you log what you eat and how you feel after eating, during your workout, post-workout, etc. and see what makes you feel best and what doesn’t.


It’s really important to fuel your body properly and with enough calories and nutrients to keep yourself feeling good.  A lot of us are trying to lose weight, but it’s important to remember that if you’re already eating at a deficit and then burning additional calories through running, you should be careful and **make sure you’re eating enough!!**  Try to be conscious of your energy intake relative to your energy output - on days where you have a really intense workout, you may need to “eat back” some of your calories.  If you are interested in calculating how many calories you are burning per mile, [this] (http://www.runnersworld.com/weight-loss/how-many-calories-are-you-really-burning?page=2 may be a useful article.  [Side note:  I some had trouble finding the full article it lists at the bottom that it adapted the info from, but managed to eventually find a copy.  If you’d like me to send you it then just PM me and I’d be happy to email it along.] 


So let’s get some discussion going about what we find works for us, both in daily life and specifically during runs and races.  I’d love to hear **your responses to the following:**


* What sort of diet have you found works best for you to fuel your daily life and your running?  Have you switched from one diet to another?  If so, how did you feel it impacted your running performance (if, in fact, you experienced any changes)
* What is your go-to pre-running meal or snack, and why?
* Post-running?
* Hydration - do you prefer water?  Gatorade? Something else?
* Fuel during runs - do you use any fuel *during* your runs?  Blocks? Gels? Bursts? Bars? Candy? Something else?  And at what point in your run do you take them? 

As always, we encourage discussion here at 90daysgoal, so if you have any questions, suggestions, or whatever, feel free to comment on each other’s posts!!!

God, this really feels like the dumbest thing in the world to ask, but I really need some feedback on it, so here goes.

I cannot make myself eat if I don't feel hungry... which wouldn't be a problem, but I'm seldom hungry. I know there are a lot of contributing factors to my completely awful diet, but the biggest hurdle for me is making myself eat *something* even if I am not hungry. I've been that way for as long as I can remember, but it got a lot worse a couple years ago. Without boring you with the details, I **had** to eat every few hours and the circumstances led to me developing a *very* strong aversion to eating when I was not hungry. As in, attempting to do so leaves me battling serious nausea.

I like food! I like eating. I'm 100% certain I do not have an eating disorder. I think I either have a hard time recognizing initial hunger cues, or either don't get them? It seems that I go from ""fine"" to ""OMGSTARVING"" over the course of about 2 minutes. Also, when I do finally recognize that I am *omgstarving*, I have about a 15-30 minute window in which to eat or it passes and I don't feel hungry anymore, even though I know I was just hungry an hour ago. And then I'm back to trying to talk myself into eating something even though the thought of doing so turns my stomach.

I typically skip breakfast (food never sounds good in the morning), eat a very late lunch (around 2-3p, when I remember I haven't eaten yet and am starving), skip dinner because I had a late lunch, feel sick late in the evening, realize I haven't eaten again, smoke to relieve the discomfort/fake an appetite, then eat everything in the house. 

I don't know what ""I'm going to be hungry soon"" feels like, can someone describe it?

I don't even know if I'm supposed to be hungry. Do you guys eat because you're hungry or because it's time to eat? If the latter, do you just get used to eating when you're not hungry? 

Any tips, experience, suggestions besides ""just eat anyway""? (Which was about all my doctor had to say... *suuuuuuuper* helpful, thanks, doc.)

Before getting into this weeks challenge, I wanted to see how you're doing with the Handstand Challenge.  If you subscribed to the challenge online, you should have received the first email, dealing with fears and motivation.

How's your motivation?  I'm struggling with mine at times, and am trying to maintain every other day for the challenge.  I know that the problem is that I don't have a set time I work on the handstands, and am going to try to find a time that works.

Do you have any fears?  For me, the biggest one is that I think I look ridiculous while I'm learning how to do new exercises, and I don't want anyone to see me practice it.

This weeks challenge: Planks

Planks are a great core exercise.  This weeks challenge is to try to do 2 minutes of planks / day.  For people who are more advanced, lets try 2 minutes, plus 2 minutes side planks as well.

Today we’re going to discuss our **gym bag essentials!** This is something I’m always curious about, since I like to know what others find useful to take with them to the gym… and new gym-goers might be wondering what people usually take along!! Do you carry anything with you in/around the gym, itself? Maybe you take just a water bottle, or maybe you prefer to use a fountain when you get thirsty. And how about music – do you take your headphones and zone to the tracks or do you prefer to not carry around your music player? If you track your workouts, how so - some people have a workout journal or paper, some might prefer to record activities on their phones, others might remember it, and some might not take note at all! What do you find necessary to keep in your gym bag and take with you when you head out to do some exercise?

Now that week 3 is drawing to a close, some of you may have already hit your Sprint 1 goals.  Others might be getting close.  And, of course, there are some of you that aren't anywhere near a goal (like me!).  However, when you do hit a goal, how do you plan on **rewarding yourself**?

Some guiding questions: do you reward yourself at all when you hit milestones or goals?  Do you do a few small rewards and then one large one when you hit something particularly important?  What types of rewards do you give yourself?  They can be money (setting aside money every time you go to the gym, subtracting money when you don't), new workout clothes, a trip to the spa (massages feel awesome when you're sore), a vacation (small or large), a new toy, etc.  How do you determine if you've earned a reward or not?  Do you assign certain goals to certain awards?

I hope everyone has a wonderful day!

Being sick is the worst. I'm done complaining. But seriously this shit wont go away haha. While being sick can certainly interrupt your schedule the introduction of a woman into my life has certainly made things more interesting. Going and meeting friends and changing my general routine has made me take a second and remind me I need to plan for more nights out and that I really need to keep my diet on point when I am not trying to woo a pretty lady.

Another interesting point that occurred was she was legit concerned about me when she slowly started to realize how much I worked out. Up to ~14 hours a week when I do everything. While it was coming from a good place and I had explained before my unhealthy relationship with food she was worried that I had replaced food with exercise and it may still be unhealthy. 

So I present to you a few questions. How do you plan and prepare for the unexpected changes in your life. Do you skip out on the diet for a few days or maybe even have emergency plans and meals prepared or available? Also how do the people in your life react to the fact that you are trying to better yourself through healthy means? Do they worry, support, or even condone your actions?

Anyways just a few things to think about today. So tell us about your day. Doing anything in the name of fitness? Let us know!",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,gold1,True,t3_1aa47l,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1aa47l/break_day_march_14th_2013/,

I'm in a major slump.  It has been crazy busy here at work, and I've been missing gym visits left and right.  On top of that, I've been feeling depressed lately (not sure why) and I've been eating and drinking junk.  

Not a great combo.

I'm now up ~3-4 lbs.  I need to snap out if it and get back on track.  Of course, I've been saying that for several weeks now...

As we draw nearer to the end of round 9, I always like to look back and see what we've learned.  This week I want to know **what did you try that just didn't work for you**?

This could be exercise or diet.  Did you try lifting weights and discover that you just did not find it fun?  Did you try running and discover you hated it?  Did you try a diet and realize that you couldn't make it work?  What have you tried?

Knowing what you've tried and knowing what hasn't worked allows you to modify what you are doing in the future.  It enables you to move forward and not keep going in circles.  No one has success 100% of the time, but you can always modify your routine until you get close.

Now is the time to look back and reflact on what happened. What worked. What didnt. 

We always should be looking back onto our past successes and failures over the week. It really does help us to remember to work hard and do what needs to be done. If you make these mistakes and never fix them then your progress will be much slower. Each of you fortunately has the wherewithal and wisdom to seek support and a group of people to motivate you.

Hope you are all having a good week and a good wednesday so far.  How did yesterday go for you all?  What are your goals/plans for today?

As we inch towards the end of Round 9, it's time for that final push.  In thinking about what you might need to do to make this round successful for you, what have been your **Struggles** this round?  Have you had trouble motivating yourself to exercise?  Have you been struggling to get enough sleep and then are too tired during the days to eat/move properly?  Do you still hold on to some bad eating habits? 

For me, it's eating.  I have been able to pick back up to exercising 6 times a week and feel great about that, especially since I'm running 20+ miles a week again.  And some days I do great with eating.  And yet, it's still a struggle for me.  A lot of days, it's hard to eat what I planned.  And once I fall off the wagon I tend to fall hard.  Just one cookie can turn into 6 pretty easily.

**Exercise** - 1 (but it was a planned rest day)

**Under Calories** - 1 day

**No Alcohol** - 88 days

How did last week go in terms of running?  Anything awesome happen?  Due to the snow, I was forced to do my long run on the treadmill... after a long 7 miles of bribing myself to just keep running, I completed it!  It was boring and painful and probably one of the more mentally tough runs I’ve ever done, but I’m glad I didn’t let the snow and my hatred of the treadmill stop me :D

It seems like quite of few of our runners here either have recently run races or are just about to - so today’s topic is **races**.  Do you have any races coming up?  If so, did you follow a specific training plan for it, or one of your own, or just willy-nilly go out running whenever?  

I’d love to hear about your **goal pace for races** - how do you decide on it?  Some of us may base it off of our regular runs, some of us may shoot for a PR from a previous race... what do you do?  

Another important aspect of racing that I would love to hear about is your **race routine** - do you have one?!  A certain meal the night before and snack the morning of?  Are there specific things you make sure to pack with you?  Prep your clothes the night before, or just wear whatever you decide on that day?  And for those of you who do longer races, do you use any fuel?

And finally, we’d all love to hear about your **fun race experiences**.  PR’s, funny costumes, cool courses, whatever - anything that in your opinion was an awesome race for whatever reason, feel free to share :D

**Also, a big good luck to LaGeryana - her half-marathon is this weekend!!**

How are you all doing?  Any groundbreaking achievements this week?  Hope all of you folks in colder parts of the world are coping well - I donned lots of layers of spandex &amp; layers and forced myself out there in the freezing cold this week. 

So, let’s get moving to today’s topic - **safety**!  Not sure about you guys, but where I’m at it tends to get dark really early, so I try to run in the day.  However, even in the daytime, the winter skies tend to make it hard to see... so how do you deal with **visibility - what gear do you usually use**?  I have a mesh fluorescent vest and I also have two little reflector things that are fluroescent pink and have red lights that blink.  However, I haven’t needed them yet because I don’t run at night and I’ve been wearing really bright zip-up jackets, so visibility hasn’t been too big of a problem. 

Another important aspect of safety while running is your location - **are you running in a populated area**?  I live in a pretty large city with a solid crime rate, so I’m constantly keeping my head on a swivel while I run.  I try to keep to popular trails and on my weekend runs there isn’t really an issue, but when I run in between classes there are fewer people because it’s the middle of the day.  However, part of this issue can be solved by **running with a buddy** - I feel a lot safer when I have a buddy with me.  If you run with earphones (or even without), please remember to **always be aware of your surroundings**!!!  I usually wear earphones, but I leave one out so I can hear if anyone approaches me... it’s also useful when a biker is coming past so I know to stay out of their way.  

Let’s hear from you - **how do you deal with the issue of safety**?  What do you wear to ensure visibility?  Do you take certain precautions to make sure you are safe, like running with a buddy or bringing pepper spray or anything?  

And as always, feel free to share anything from your training last week :D

**Edit:**  Just remembered I saw [this video] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOyZ98gdoQg) posted in r/running a bit ago... for **those of you who run in the evenings and at night**, it’s important to wear reflective gear, not just light shirts.  Stay safe, folks :D

So, everyone, this is the beginning of Week 8 of Round 9 and it's time to plan your optimal week... what do you have on the schedule as your major goals for the upcoming week?

* Sunday - 7 mi run (doing this in a bit...)
* Monday - lift &amp; swim, go to meeting
* Tuesday - group meeting w/ prof to go over a draft of our paper, 4 mi run @ race pace (ideally 10min/mi)
* Wednesday - lift &amp; crosstrain, study for exams and write a composition for Spanish
* Thursday - 3 mi, 2 exams
* Friday - 3.5 mi, core exercises
* Saturday - Usually a rest day but I might go to kickboxing!

There's my optimal week, looks like it will be pretty busy but we'll see how it turns out!!  Your turn - what's your week ahead shaping up to look like?

Our beloved Saturday poster, fxpstclvrst, is moving house this weekend and will be off the grid (well...the internet grid) for a few days, so I'm filling in! Happy Saturday! 

How was your week? What were your challenges and your successes? We're officially into the third week of 2013, schools are back in session, the President is about to be re-inaugurated, and the Superbowl is coming up quickly (as well as Mardi Gras!). That's a lot of happenings in the world, so I want to know what's happening with you! 

How are you doing with sticking with your New Year's resolutions? How do you stay on top of your plans when life is throwing you curveballs? I like to preach the idea of preparation, but it can be really hard to be prepared for everything. How much freedom to you give yourself to relax or screw up, and where do you draw the line to get back into healthy practices? 

I hope everyone is having a happy, healthy weekend, and I can't wait to hear from you about all the good things you're doing for yourself!

Yesterday was my first day of classes and I guess I got a little caught up in the excitement. How are classes going for everyone else? 

As students, we probably spend a lot of time at our desks or in the library, or running from class to class to club to whatever. And sometimes, we snack. If you're like me, you'd love to snack even more than you do. When I ask 90DGers what topics they want to cover in the student posts, snacks inevitably comes up several times. 

So let's talk about snacks. 

First of all, is a snack really a small meal that you're catching between classes, or is just a bite to tide you over until a real meal can be made, found, or bought? Are you snacking from boredom, hunger, or something else? What kind of snacks do you usually crave, and when do you crave them? 

Thinking about why you're snacking can help you determine what kind of snack to eat. If it's a small meal for you between classes, try to create a snack with the same breakdown as a normal meal. If you're snacking out of boredom, try to catch yourself doing it, and find something new to do. If you're always craving certain types of treats, find a healthy snack that satisfies that taste, like yogurt or fruit for a sweet tooth, popcorn or roasted veggies for salty snack.

So what are you craving lately? When and why do you snack? I can tell you that, before I went to the gym yesterday, I was HONGRY. So I ate a few bites of Greek yogurt mixed with protein powder and a coupla handfuls of roasted broccoli. Delicious, filling, healthy. Sometimes I'll have a sugarfree pudding cup or a Coke Zero to satisfy a sweet tooth, and I almost always carry an orange. 

Share your snack ideas! Maybe you'll get snacking inspiration from someone else! Now I kinda feel like having a little bite...

How are you doing today?  How is your progress towards your goals going?  What do you have planned for today?  Anything interesting planned for this weekend?

I'm sicker than a dog right now and while I desperately want to go to the gym, I know it's better for me to stay home and focus on getting well than going and infecting everyone else and possibly making myself sicker.  

What do you do when confronted with illness?  Do you stay home and take it easy?  Do you still do some form of exercise?  Do you have varying levels of ""dealing with it"" based on how bad you're feeling?  If you do exercise, do you do your usual routine, but perhaps at a lower intensity, or do you do something different?

Of course, the big question is, what do you do to get over your illness the fastest?

Take some time to review the past year and think about the challenges you overcame, the healthy changes you made, and consider goals you'd like to accomplish in the new year. And I hope you all have a great 2013!

Today’s topic is **illness**.  We’re right in the middle of cold and flu season and I’m sure we’re all crossing our fingers that we don’t get hit with any crazy bugs.  However, in the unwelcomed event that you do end up getting sick and are out of commission temporarily, how do you usually deal with it?  

Do you change your *diet* at all?  Do you take time off from *exercising* until you’ve recovered, or do you power through it as usual, or do you just switch it up a bit and do something lighter and in-between?  What’s your *go-to cure* for anything - a cold, the flu, a sore throat, a massive headache?  Is there *anything else* you usually do when sick that seems to make you feel better?

I went and got fitted again last week because mine are getting pretty worn, so I’m going to rotate shoes for a while - I ended up with the new version of the same pair (Mizuno Wave Inspire 8 to the [Wave Inspire 9] (http://images.google.com/imgres?q=mizuno+wave+inspire+9&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;biw=1014&amp;bih=699&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=go2PhqLvTprgfM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp%3FproductId%3D16559836&amp;docid=ahyrrWH1gDshfM&amp;imgurl=http://dsp.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/pDSP1-14374161p275w.jpg&amp;w=275&amp;h=279&amp;ei=wyPbUPPhI4q20QHcmoDACg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=465&amp;sig=117714514022360457306&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=136&amp;tbnw=134&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=22&amp;ved=1t:429,r:8,s:0,i:114&amp;tx=76&amp;ty=48)), so it should be an easy transition.

Anyway, on to today’s topic:  **tracking**  

How do you keep track of yourself *during* the run?  Some people use GPS watches, some people use apps, and some people just know the distance of their specific route and don’t use anything else - so what do you do?!  I use the Nike+ iPhone app, which logs the total time, my average pace, and my mileage.  It also has the mile splits and you can see/log a few other things (type of surface, weather, etc.).  However, I’m considering getting a GPS watch soon, so to those of you who use one of those I would love to hear what brand and model you use and how you feel about it!

How do you keep track of everything *after* the run?  Spreadsheet?  Fitocracy?  Something else?  I log on Fitocracy, but I keep track of everything in my own spreadsheet, as well, so I have a more solid storage space that is organized in a way that (I think) makes it easier for me to check my progress and history.  

Any other tracking-related things you’d like to share or questions you have?  For those of you who might be looking for something to use to track your runs, here are a few sites/apps that seem to be popular:  DailyMile, Runkeeper, Nike+, MapMyRun... if anyone else has any to add, just post it in your comment and I’ll edit this main post to add it :D

Edit:  It looks like some of the other apps/programs/things that we use to track include the following: running diaries/logs, Gym-Pact, CardioTrainer, Strava",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,1356981451.0,,self8,True,t3_15h0vx,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/15h0vx/runners_week_4_tracking_your_runs/,

I'm fairly new to running seriously - I've always run as a component of sports in high school, but within the past three months I've started running just to run, and have found that I really enjoy it!  This brings me to what I came up with for this week's topic... **WHY DO YOU RUN?**

For me, I started running simply as a way to exercise and lose weight.  However, something strange clicked as I started doing it more that made me genuinely enjoy it and want to push myself harder and farther.  I think that ""click"" might have kicked in when I first went on a trail near my family's house - I felt oddly at peace, and realized that running can be an enjoyable thing rather than an evil punishment threatened by sports coaches when you slack off during practice!

I continue running because I like to see what I am capable of as I keep pushing harder.  I tend to get competitive with myself, and with running you can push yourself in terms of time/speed or in terms of distance.  I also keep running because I find it to be an excellent stress reliever.  Between work, classes, schoolwork, and thinking about grad school, I've had a ton on my mind lately, and it turns out that running helps me clear out my brain and think about other things for a bit!  I tend to throw on my earphones and just zone to the music, letting random thoughts wander about my brain.  Runs, and especially the long ones, have been great sources of reflection over these past few weeks - they take me away from the computer and distractions in my apartment and allow me to set aside time to really look at myself and try to figure out what I want out of life, which is a major issue for me as I try to work out what I want to do for grad school.  

On a less serious note, I also have grown to enjoy running because I absolutely love having the chance to be outside for a prolonged period of time :D

So, how about you guys?  I would love to hear about why it is that you run.  What motivated you to start running?  Why do you keep doing it?  What is it that you really love when you go out for a run (or when you hop on the treadmill or go around the track, if that's what you prefer!)?",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,self8,True,t3_12skvv,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/12skvv/runners_week_13_guest_post/,

How many hours do you need to be able to function?  How many hours of sleep do you actually get?  If you are running a deficit, how do you stop being so damn tired?  Does sleeping in ever help or does that mess you up for days?

Oh--and for laughs, here is my blurry Instagram pic of my [Jem costume](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JKtYpr3yfCw/UJEtbZthBUI/AAAAAAAAA1I/nat4XzCYIEU/s640/IMG_20121027_224548.jpg) from Saturday night.  I should have had my microphone in that one!  Drats! lol.

I hope your week has been going well and your weekend is on track to be productive, relaxing, or a lot of fun.

It's almost the holiday of Halloween, and part of the fun is investigating the spooky and sometimes scary side of life. But oftentimes, when it comes to our health, we experience scares that aren't so much fun...but they can prompt us to turn our lives around. Have you had a health scare that forced you to change something about yourself? Are you afraid or concerned about the effects some of your prior habits (or habits you're trying to change) will have on your body and your longevity?

I had emergency gallbladder surgery a little over two years ago, and it completely changed my life. Not only did I start eating meat to get enough protein, I also started paying more attention to my health and going to doctors when something was wrong - a marked change from several years earlier, when I probably broke a bone in my foot but never went to a doctor about it (I KNOW, what a bonehead move). I credit that scare with putting me on the path that led me to join this community, to see my GP who put me on anxiety medication and the eating plan that led to my weight loss, and to seek treatment for my frozen shoulder (which restored total movement of that arm to me).

If you're comfortable sharing your own story, feel free to do so - or just do your daily check-in. Cheers, all.

It's recovery week, so I'm not gonna give you guys anything to talk about today.  If you haven't recapped Sprint 2 for us, do that.  If you haven't written out goals for Sprint 3, do that.  Or talk about whatever's on your minds.  :)

Oh!  Yesterday I spent 7 hours in a training session at work, and something the trainer said seems relevant.  She said that in a long-term study done somewhere about something (I pay attention well, eh?), the only people who achieved whatever goal they had set were the 3% who wrote them down.  Um, point is, **Write down your goals** for the maximum chance of success!

I'm still sick - still! - and in a house full of noise and crazy. But I also feel like the busier I am, the better I can handle things. After work on Friday, I ran errands, then came home to bake two sheets of cookies and a loaf of banana bread with nieces and nephews before going out to dinner, taking the dogs for a walk, and cleaning.

Do you prefer being busy, or do you like relaxation? How do you feel that affects the way you take care of yourself? Anything worth changing in your life about the pace that brings you the most comfort or seems most natural?

It's a lame thursday for me because I have to wait 2 weeks until I can get results on my MRI on my knee. Hopefully nothing is wrong. I don't there is anything to worry about but it would be nice to have a professional opinion. 

So what is everyone up to today? Have any big plans for fitness? Doing the same old routine?

Last weekend was strange for me. I finally had some free time and had my brother stay up for the weekend and we just chilled drank, ate and played video games. Torchlight II specifically. It was a great time to have some free time for once with everything going on but the weird part was we ate super healthy and very small portions and on Monday I looked like a champ in the mirror! It wasnt so much intentional just that we actually cooked our meals and ate only until we werent full. It was a nice reminder what needs to be done again if I want to make progress. I really need to buckle down, count my calories, not snack, and just do what I know I need to do. So simple to say but so hard to follow sometimes. 

Have a great day everyone!

How was everyone's day yesterday?  Did you do anything fun or exciting?  Did you hit all of your goals or only some of them?  How are you today?  Are you ready for the weekend like me?

Life has been so busy lately, I'm totally ready for a vacation.  Unfortunately, that cannot be, so I will have to take what little down time I am given until Thanksgiving.  That brings me to today's discussion: **do you keep exercising on vacation or do you take the time off?**

I always try to exercise on vacation but then I never actually do.  Usually I'm so fed up with the hotel exercise rooms that I don't bother going there.  However, I typically like to explore on my vacations, so I do get some amount of exercise in, with all the hiking, swimming, snorkeling, skiing, etc.  I never used to eat very healthy on vacations, but now I think I'm going to start doing that.  I started watching what I ate on my two most recent vacations and it went fairly well so I'll be doing that again.

What do you guys do?  Any tips or tricks?

My fitness pursuits have been going well. My knee is very function but not close to 100%. This is good because it allows me to baby it during workouts which is fine and it will not hurt any more the next day. I'm hoping to do a mud run in a few weeks so hopefully it will be fine by then. We will see!

What are you up to today? Anything interesting going on? I actually had a strange experience this weekend where because I look fit and was the best man at my friends wedding I was invited to go take a flying trapeze lesson. It was pretty wicked. That opportunity would have passed me if I didnt take care of myself. Just something neat to share. Have a great day everyone!

Sprint 1 is over, so rather than a topical post today we'll be focusing on how the first sprint went, and planning for the second. As always, **nanochic** and myself are here if you have any questions.

----------

**Sprint 1 Results**

How did your first sprint go? We talked about lifting programs, proper nutrition, and recovery during the first sprint. What results did you see over the past 30 days? Higher maxes in the gym? More muscle mass? Let us know what you did for Sprint 1, what worked, what didn't! 

**Sprint 2 Goals**

For sprint 2 - I'd encourage you to set goals not only inside the gym but outside the gym as well. For a week at a time, we talked about either getting more sleep, more protein, or trying out a new supplement. It doesn't need to be one of these 3, but for sprint 2, try to set yourself a goal in an area that's typically a weak spot for you. For me personally, I eat plenty of protein, but sleep is a big issue for me, so my Sprint 2 challenge is going to be getting 7 hours of a sleep a night for the entire sprint.

Not doing so hot today.  It's nothing fitness related, but Im so overwhelmed with feeling like I'll never catch a break.  New a/c acting up...it's not even two months old (AFTER dealing with our other crappy a/c).  Basically, I just want to curl in a ball and cry.  

On the bright side of things, I planned my meals all week so at least I wont have to worry about what to make for dinner.  I really think Im going to do this from now on.  Saves on time &amp; money.

So how about you?  We are officially 30 days into this round.  How are things going in your neck of the woods?  Did you meet your goals yesterday?  Why or why not?  Let's hear it!

I know not everyone is comfortable discussing it, but I find this to be a very safe &amp; accepting forum and if you are up to it--join in!

Are you letting yourself where clothes that you didnt use to wear before? How are these changes effecting you?   Let us know!

Me...personally? This round is about loving myself.  Ive been able to look into the mirror a few times and tell myself that.  It's kind of a big deal.  And as I learn to accept myself, Ive noticed that Ive become more accepting of my SO's compliments towards me.  If he says I look pretty, I say thank you--instead of denying it &amp; saying I look bad.  Im trying to stop covering my stomach, trying to feel okay with the him seeing me in a bathing suit in the bright sun, but one thing at a time!

This is the place to post recipes, pics of your food, questions about nutrition, anything food related is fair game.

----

This week, I'd like to talk about something most of us can relate to: cooking when we're short on time and/or motivation. Most of us have a few recipes in our bag of tricks that we can cook practically in our sleep, get on the table quickly and please a crowd with. Have you had to adapt your standards to fit with your eating plan? Are you struggling to find replacements for your staple recipes?


Personally, I have a bunch of cookbooks that I really like, called [Food Made Fast](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Williams-Sonoma%3A+food+made+fast+), from Williams-Sonoma. The books are divided into sections, depending on how long the recipes take to make (30 minutes start to finish, 15 minutes hands on, make more to store...), and they're the first place I go when meal planning for the week. There are lots of these types of cookbooks/recipes out there these days. Any suggestions for things to try? 

My favorites from these books include [fennel crusted pork tenderloin](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/fennel-crusted-pork-tenderloin.html) (weeknight, 30 min start to finish), [spicy black bean soup](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/spicy-black-bean-soup.html?cm_src=RECIPESEARCH) (soups, 30 min start to finish) and the [red pepper and goats cheese fritatta](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/red-pepper-and-goat-cheese-frittata.html?cm_src=RECIPESEARCH) (simple suppers, 30 min start to finish). Actually, after the first time we made that fritatta, they became one of our go-to recipes. They're great for clearing the fridge of any vegetables/cheese that needs to be cooked, and they're easy and quick to prepare. We have fritatta and salad at least once a week.


That segues neatly into our next topic. What are your go to recipes, the ones you don't have to think about and whose ingredients migrate into your fridge week after week, seemingly by magic? For me, the fritatta is always an option. I've always got some kind of cheese(goats, mozzarella, feta..), veggies(spinach, peas, tomatoes, roasted red peppers...) and eggs ready to be thrown together when my brain is too fried to function. 

Another go to for us is steak salad. Whenever steak goes on sale, we buy a bunch of it, and separate it out into portions. We make up a batch of marinade(oil, soy sauce, ginger, sherry, sugar(we've been leaving this out lately because I'm ketoing) and some chili flakes), and then add the marinade to each portion of steak. These then go in the freezer, so when they are later defrosted, they've marinated. Steak salad can be on the table 15 minutes after you walk in the door.

After a long eventful weekend where my neighbors house caught on fire and had us evacuated for an undetermined amount of time I got to experience the kindness of other people. People are so willing to rally around someone in time of need. This isnt a bad thing just a new experience for me since I have always been highly self sufficient. 

My question for you is do you often get the chance to help others with their fitness? I like to think if someone was in a time of need where they needed to change their life around to a more active lifestyle I would be able to assist and would do so without thinking twice. On the other hand some people are ignorant to the basics of fitness and see my/our lifestyles as dangerous. Do you have to deal with these people often?

Ever since I started working out and aiming to get fit it has done more for me emotionally and personally than physically. This is just another reason why I feel working out is so important. Not super relevant to losing 5lbs before a beach weekend but I feel its important to note none the less.

So what are you doing today in the name of fitness? I actually got my boss to let me work the early shift so I could fit all of my errands and climbing training in today. Should be a good but long day. Let us know what you are up to!

Well, it used to be that I would open a box of crackers and eat the entire box in two days.  Now, they've been open long enough to actually taste stale.  I'm pretty excited about that.  

The second little thing is that for ""dessert"" yesterday I ate tomato slices with splenda on them.  Not the popsicles or ice cream in my freezer, but tomatoes.  So what about you?  What ""little things"" have you started doing?

It seems like a lot of you are doing C25K – Did you make it to Week 2?  How many miles did you run last week?  Did you have any accomplishments/setbacks you’d like to talk about?  What are your running plans for this week?

As for me, I only ran 21 miles last week, but that’s because instead of doing a long run I did a 10k race over the weekend.  **Which I won!**  (Sorry to keep bragging but I’m super excited about it!)  A year ago I was an overweight couch potato who only wore stretchy pants to work because I didn’t want to admit to myself what size pants I would have to buy.  Then I discovered 90 days goal and running and lost 40 pounds over 2 rounds.  This week I should hit 30 miles, capped off by a 13 mile run sometime this weekend.

*** 

This week’s theme is: **tracking websites**.  How do you keep track of your miles?  I think it’s great to track so that you can see how much you’ve accomplished over time.  Personally I use DailyMile.  I like the info it gives you, and it syncs up with my Garmin watch, and it tells you’re your current yearly mileage.  As of today, I have run 699 miles in 2012 (will roll over 700 at my running club tonight)!  I also track on Fitocracy, mostly so I can participate in the challenges (I hope you all signed up for the Sprint 1 Running Distance challenge!)

We are closing the data collection for good this week. 

Thanks to the 90daysgoal community (extra shout out to the mods), we gathered a huge amount of data that will help us understand how different variables (intention, motivation self-efficacy, planning...) interact together to foster physical activity adoption and, above all, maintenance ...  

Despite considerable attrition (almost 50% of the sample dropped from the study and/or community halfway through),  we managed to obtain a few significant results in our preliminary analyses to confirm our most complex hypotheses,   and more than enough data to validate one of the questionnaires we have been developping.  

We are extremely thankful for taking part in one of our first DIY research project, especially to those who have been brave and patient enough to stick with us until the end.  
We will be able to run exhaustive analyses and produce refined results to share with you around september. 

For the moment,  we would like to announce the name of our 3 winners ot the 25$ US prizes.    I have sent an email them, asking permission to name them in this post. They will have one week to claim their prize !


Once again,  thank you so much for taking part in our project.  We wish you good luck and courage in the current round.  Thanks !

Sorry about the delay in the post - I'm not feeling too well and consequently slept for near 12 hours.  

It's the weekend!  It's also the end of the first week!  By now I'm sure you've been tested in your will power (I sure as heck was) and your dedication.  How did your week go?  What was the hardest thing to do?  Where did you slip up?  Where did you succeed?  Did you decide on how you are going to exercise?  How did that go?

How was yesterday?  What do you have planned for the weekend?

I won't lie to you - weekend are hard.  You're home and you're surrounded by all your food, TV, the gym is far away, and you might have a to-do list a mile long.  This brings us to today's topic: **dealing with cravings.**

I know we touched a little upon this when we talked about what we do in social situations, but cravings can hit anywhere.  What do you to do combat those cravings?  Do you give in and have a bit?  Do you try to find something else?  Do you drink water until those cravings go away?  Let us know!  Your plan of action might help someone else who doesn't know what to do.

My goals were:

* Exercise - Start weightlifting again

* Weight - Get to my goal weight of 163 pounds

* Health - Get some cardio going on

And then...

* Exercise bork - My left shoulder went wonky; I went to physical therapy for frozen shoulder last year, then tapered off my PT by the beginning of this year. I should have kept it up to keep my shoulder muscles strong, because I wound up trying to lift too much and abandoning my weightlifting plan as a result.

* Health bork - I had a mystery ailment that lasted for a month when my boyfriend, delighting in my weight loss, told me how tiny I was and tried to pick me up and carry me over his shoulder. I laughed and tried to resist, and then I felt a pain in my abdomen. Immediately afterward, I was nauseated and dizzy with abdominal discomfort that just would not go away. A month of this shit! After a visit to the ER, my GP, and a gastroenterologist, the consensus is I probably tore some scar tissue in my abdomen from when I had gallbladder surgery two years ago. So my abdomen was irritated and painful, and I had a nice case of side effect IBS from that abdominal trauma. YAY. I had some other exploratory tests lined up this past week, but I canceled them all because I have a family member with a terminal illness who is likely to pass away any day now, and I am basically waiting to go out of state for the funeral and to spend a week with my family.

* Food bork - For a month, it was difficult for me to eat at all, because my appetite was totally gone from being in constant discomfort and nauseated by everything. I had to force myself to eat eventually because I was getting pretty weak.

The ONLY good news is that my paleo-ish, lower carb diet has led me to reach my goal weight of 163 pounds. I hit that about the time I got sick, so being sick didn't really affect that goal at all. I've been at my goal weight for the last several weeks and haven't gained or lost, which is good both ways, because I really can't afford to buy smaller pants just now, hehe. I love how I look and think I'm adorable; the weight loss is really apparent around my face, and I've lost my double chin almost completely.

What, you want to see a [picture?](http://i.imgur.com/mEcA6.png) Ok!

Also, I got to do a 5k with my sweet little girl dog in May. It was so much fun. [Here we are!](http://i.imgur.com/R6iGW.jpg)

Since I reached my goal, I've been eating off and on like crap. I've been afraid to buy groceries for fear they'll go bad when I have to drop everything to go out of town for aforementioned imminent funeral. Plus, I've been eating for comfort; when someone comes to your dying relative's house and brings over a warm plate of chocolate oatmeal cookies, if you're me, you're going to stuff a lot of them in your face. Tears make cookies taste better! Sniff.

My goals for the next round:

* Emotional unbork - Pull myself together and start eating ""normally"" again. No more cookies and club sandwiches because you're sad, young lady.

* Weight nerf - New goal weight will be 145.

* Exercise hax - Now that my innards are kind of healed again, take the stairs daily again.

* Health buff - Reschedule at least the most important of the tests I'd scheduled to make sure I don't have a chest burster or [Kuato](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO1kKemcwYk) living in my abdomen. After I'm cleared, start doing exercise again, probably starting with pilates. My eventual goal is to get strong enough to start running and do C25K.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last round we had public challenges which means that any other user on Fitocracy was able to join. We voted on that one and it was decided that this round the challenges stay private, which means, we mods have to invite you to the challenges, which means a little bit more work for you, but I am sure it just requires a few minutes of your time to join. What now follows is a detailed description of steps necessary for you to join the challenges:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to join a challenge**

1) If you haven't already, **join [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com)**. Back in the days (last round) people needed invites to join Fitocracy. This does not seem to be the case anymore, if however you run into problems and can not join / need an invite message one of the mods and we will help you.

2) **Follow the user [90DaysGoalBot](http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/90DaysGoalBot/)**. This means click on the link and hit the button on the top right that says ""FOLLOW"". (If it says ""UNFOLLOW"" you are already following that user). We have to do this as there is no other way for us to add you to the challenges. Also that is a user that every mod has access to so we can add you pretty fast.

3) Tell us which challenges you want to join. Do this via the comments here. We will need your Fitocracy Username to do this. Ideally it will look something like: **""Fitocracy:[User] Challenge: a,b,d""**. An mod will answer your request here once you have been invited.

4) Check your messages on [Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/notifications/) and click the invitation link. Then in the group, click the top right button that says **""JOIN GROUP""**.

5) After joining, you have to join the challenge as well. Check the left side in the group for the **""JOIN CHALLENGE""** button. I can not stress this enough. **If you want to take part you have to do this before May 4th**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If there are any questions left, we are willing to help you with every step. Don't hesitate to ask.

Day #2 of the break. It has been a long week for me. My hard drive died last night with all of my resumes and job hunting stuff on it so I am dreading spending the time to try and get it all back. Oh well. Sometimes things just dont go as expected. 

This week has actually been a full week for me as I didnt miss any workouts. I am actually quite sore from Taekwondo also. How do you generally handle being sore? Is there anything you do to prevent it? Is there anything you do to recover from it?

Good luck with all of your goals today and let us know about anything else going on!

How did everyone do with their Sprint 2 goals?  Success?  Not-quite-success?  

I succeeded in one of my two Sprint 2 goals.  I've graduated from B210K!  I never thought I'd see the day when I could run an hour straight.

I did not succeed in my second goal, which was to get my weight lifting back to where it was last December.  I'm still hobbled by tendonitis in both arms, though it is now much improved.  My PT has asked me to not do *any* upper body exercise for the next few weeks, which is driving me nuts.

How about you?

**How was yesterday for you all? How was your week? Did you accomplish everything you set out to do? What are your goals for today and how are you going to achieve them?**

Personally, I'm about to start a major cut using LeanGains, Intermittent Fasting, and a new exercise regime. Not sure how well it will go as things are extremely stressful as I begin the separation process with my marriage. I'm trying to stay strong and not give in to emotional eating and apathy. I don't want to punish myself and it's what I usually do. Wish me luck.

Again, let's start out with [this awesome directory](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/fugnw/food_archive_of_auntrhubarbs_helpful_food_posts/) that was started by [AuntRhubarb](http://www.reddit.com/user/AuntRhubarb) detailing many useful foods and their nutritional information as well as recipes and ideas for them provided by users. Feel free to add on here with more helpful foods and we'll get them added to the directory.

**Today's food is cranberries.**

I cup of chopped cranberries (110g)  contains the following nutritional information:

* Calories : 51

* Fat: 0g

* Carbohydrates: 13g

* Fibers: 5g

* Sugars: 4g

* Protein: 0g

* Vitamin A: 1%

* Vitamin C: 24%

* Iron: 2%

* Calcium: 1%

Since the early 21st century within the global functional food industry, raw cranberries have been marketed as a ""superfruit"" due to their nutrient content and antioxidant qualities. Raw cranberries have moderate levels of vitamin C, dietary fiber and the essential dietary mineral, manganese, as well as a balanced profile of other essential micronutrients. They are a source of polyphenol antioxidants, phytochemicals under active research for possible benefits to the cardiovascular system and immune system, and as anti-cancer agents, such as in isolated prostate cancer cells.

Let's talk about unhealthy bad habits today.  What are your bad habits that you 1) have broken, 2) need to break, and/or 3) have come to terms with?

For me, I was a pack a day smoker from age 18 to 35.  I started smoking in college when they still had things like smoking lounges on campus.  I was playing in a rock band at the time, and everyone else in the band smoked, as did a few of my close friends.  When we'd play gigs, every bar was filled with smokers.  You couldn't avoid it.  I tried smoking a few times, and before you knew it, I was addicted.  I quit for a while after my first child was born, but then started up again, mostly due to social pressure.  Finally, when I was 34, I switched to the nicotine patch, and after a few false starts, I ultimately kicked the habit.  I've been nicotine free since then (~10 years), and have stayed off of it by focusing on exercise.  It's tough to smoke when you run almost every day. :-)

How about you?

Also, what are your goals for today?  How's Sprint #2 going so far?

Have fun,

Nox

Yesterday I was stuck home with a sick kid so I did my workout here pretty much all day. It was nice. My head is all screwy thanks to shark week and just being run down in general.

Eating out is the downfall of so many diets! So what are we gonna do about it? We all know about trying to make healthy choices, but what can we do when we don't have the nutritional info on hand?

Well! We research! Here's a few online resources to help aid you in making healthier choices when eating out...

* [The Fatbase](http://www.vancouversun.com/life/food/fatabase/lists.html)

* [Calorie Count Restaurant Database](http://caloriecount.about.com/fast-food-restaurants-mc3)

* [Fast Food Nutrition](http://www.fastfoodnutrition.org/)

* [Food Facts Search Engine](http://www.foodfacts.info/)

Got any resources to add in? I know there's lots of apps out there as well to help with this kind of stuff.

I found this on a website, and I feel it can be pretty relevant to alot of our situations.  I know how easy it can be to be down on ourselves for slow progress but remember: this is a journey.  It doesn't happen overnight.  Find pride in your accomplishments, even when you don't feel like its much.

So far this week we've talked about finding your fit, reflecting on the last 30 days, finding a buddy, getting enough sleep, and the advantages of eating edamame.

**What have you taken away from 90daysgoal this week? Have you learned anything? Do you have any questions so far? What are you going to do to make next week even better than this week?**

Personally, things are going pretty well with diet and awesome with exercise. I can't wait to get to the gym tomorrow!

How was yesterday? Did you reach your goals? What are your goals for today?

Yesterday I got my workout done but diet is still off completely. I really can't seem to give a fuck about it because I don't have a plan to follow. I don't know if I want to do keto anymore since it's seriously a pain in the ass to cook separate meals for myself when I cook for my family. Still thinking on it.

**Today's topic is barbell lifts and workouts.**

As a reminder, here's the link to the [exercise and muscle directory](http://www.exrx.net/Lists/Directory.html) that I posted before. Bookmark it, as it's a wonderful resource!

In addition to the above, I stumbled across an awesome Wikipedia resource for exercises based on muscles groups: [List of Weight Training Exercises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_weight_training_exercises)

The barbell is very simple tool, so it is easy to learn the basic lifts quickly. With proper coaching, anyone without any debilitating pre-conditions can learn most barbell exercises in under an hour. The olympic lifts may be an exception for some, but I was taught each one in about an hour’s time.

The weight is fixed and stable, so the tool itself is less likely to deviate from a normal range of motion. This is an advantage for the barbell because, when under heavy load, you do not want the barbell to deviate at all, as this could result in immediate injury. This could also be seen as a disadvantage, because intelligent training should have components programmed in that will take the trainee outside the scope of their sport or activity – effectively training extreme ranges of motion as a safety-valve for when a movement does deviate from what is expected.

Another advantage of the barbell is that unlimited progression is possible because you can always add more weight to the bar. Of course, every lifter has their own genetically pre-determined maxes that they can handle. So, in theory, one could reach a point in their training where further progression is impossible. Being able to add more weight easily makes progressing with this tool very simple. - [Source](http://physicalliving.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-barbell-training-testing-the-tried-and-true-training-tool-for-strength-training/)

I found myself at a loss for words when I blatantly purchased 6 peanut butter filled donuts because I had to stop at a gas station. 

Why did I purchase these donuts? Because I was hungry. Who was I sharing them with? No one.

I am not quite sure what came over me to think that it was a good idea. We all fail from out diets and sometimes the things that we are embarrassed about are ones like these. Where we display our inner glutton and think this is who we actually are.

First things first, you aren't a glutton. You may have a unhealthy relationship with food sometimes but this is something we are working on together. Its not easy and its not always going to work but that's why we are here.

Have you failed in this process recently? I mean I did and I can laugh about it now because I forget how much of a weakness gas station stops and having spare cash can be for me. 

I recognize the issue. I determined the root cause. I found a way to fix it. I put the plan in motion. Fixing your diet is this simple process. Just repeatedly and often. 

Do good work today and remember you have all of the power in changing who you are and your relationship with food.

We'll probably be staying there for about 3-4 weeks. In my husbands family they are all really thin (including my husband), despite eating a lot of deep fried food and drinking soda with every meal. I always gain weight while I'm there... 

I'm losing motivation now because I know it will be almost impossible to keep my good eating and exercise habits while I'm there, and I might end up coming back heavier than I was when I started this 90 day goal challenge!

 I also feel a bit hopeless because I won't be able to get off enough of this pregnancy weight before we're going to actually have any proper clothes that fit... or to feel comfortable or at ease on any beach... But since this weight *will* come off I really don't want to go and buy new clothes either (the process of doing that will probably just make me feel even worse).

How was yesterday? Did you reach your goals? What are your goals for today?

**Let's talk about how your week went and what you want to accomplish in the coming week.**

So far this week we've talked about supplements, food, reflected on the small changes we've made, and surviving weekends. What have you taken away from 90daysgoal this week? Have you learned anything? Do you have any questions so far?

Personally, I'm still trying to figure out diet. Having a carb feed day on my keto diet has led to me just going off track completely. Now I am trying to figure out if I want to go back to IF + keto or if I want to try something new and more geared towards my weightlifting versus fat loss. Too many choices!

So, 90DG'ers, are you ready for tomorrow's check-in? I'm excited that we have so many of you participating. I can't wait to see each and every one of you reach your goals!

Have a great day everyone!!

What are you all doing this weekend? Anything planned? Any goals?

Speaking of goals, have you started thinking about what you hope to achieve for next round and how you're going to get there?

Personally, I'm still reveling in my newest achievement. I've officially dropped 50 lbs total. Yesterday I weighed in at 248.4, down from 299 a year ago. I also fit into a smaller sized pant!

I haven't put my goals to paper (or computer in my case) but I'm thinking of more specific goals other than lose x amount of pounds and x amount of body fat. I'm really interested in doing more of certain types of exercises (pushups, planking, handstands, etc.). I'm also focused on more yoga so that I can continue trying to get to this level [Yoga By Briohny Smyth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loszrEZvS_k)

I hope you all have a fabulous day!

You have 10 days before we start the next round. So I think one of the most important things is to start setting your goals, make a plan, and make sure its reasonable.

What I listed above is exactly why I made no progress this round. I know how to lose weight and I know how to structure my workouts but I never made a definitive plan. I never tracked it. I had no accountability because I stopped participating in the daily goal posts. These are all things I did when I made the most success towards my goals. They kept me focused. It wasnt easy at first but when it became routine I had a much better sense and feel on how I was doing and it felt great.

I realize now that these are the things I need to incorporate back into my life to make more progress. So over the next two weeks really take a look at yourself. Habits, progress, failures, and successes and make a solid plan on how to take it to the next level.

Personally, I am around 12% body fat. I have been in this group since the beginning where I started at 30% but my final goal is 10%. 90 days is plenty of time to drop 2% body fat but not when you are complacent.

Successes: I am very good at managing my weight. I haven’t gained a thing in a while. I eat healthy and make up for it when I don’t by eating less or healthier the next day. Once I hit my goal weight I could maintain it without any issues.

Failures: I have become a sucker for snacks. I know for a fact this is why I haven’t lost weight. Nothing else about my diet has changed. Complacency has set in where I am so happy with my results but when it comes to a little dedication and focus to drop that last bit who needs it? I need it because that is the goal I set and I will achieve it. I have to believe that.

What to do from here: I need to plan my meals to avoid snacking, I need to setup a smart caloric deficit. I need to plan my workouts to make sure I am not missing anything to keep me healthy for my rock climbing and Taekwondo.

We mods work to help you have the resources and tools to help yourselves achieve your goals whatever they may be. So take the next two weeks and look into what you can do to improve your progress and make yourself a better person. So what are you doing to prepare for the next round? Have any questions?

You can rebuild yourself. We have the technology.

I plan on making up my goals for the next round today. If anyone is interested I could put them in another post and talk about them.

At the end of Rounds [1](http://redd.it/e3268), [2](http://redd.it/fr6ca), and [3](http://redd.it/huv6w), I had some definite results and a lot to digest. After Rounds 4 and 5, things slowed down, much less progress, and I never ended up writing a final progress post. But I think *not* writing wrap up posts hurt my motivation going into the next rounds, so I'm gonna try writing one again to see if it helps me get off to a good start in Round 7.

R6 Starting stats - 1/9/2012:

* 27 years old
* 5' 8.5"" tall
* 153.0 lbs
* 31.0% body fat according to scale
* 28.2% body fat according to tape measure method
* 28.5"" waist
* 40.0"" hips
* [Progress pics from the end of R3](http://i.imgur.com/rSPGY.jpg)

R6 Final stats - 4/7/2012:

* 144.2 lbs *(-8.8 lbs)* (and a [weight plot since R1](http://i.imgur.com/IkbYC.png))
* 28.1% body fat according to scale *(-2.5%)*
* 25.0% body fat according to tape measure method *(-3.2%)*
* 27.5"" waist *(-1.0"")*
* 38.5"" hips *(-1.5"")*
* [Progress pics from the end of R6](http://imgur.com/a/Zonjd) (I need to put these in the same format so it's easier to compare, but I'll have to do it later.)

Method:

* I set a small calorie deficit (1650 for most of the round, 1400 toward the end) and tracked everything in LiveStrong. I didn't set any hard food restrictions, but I've kept a pretty clean, steady diet for the past few rounds. During the week, my meals are usually pretty repetitive. Breakfast: massive egg/egg white/veggie/cheese scramble. Morning snack: coffee and fruit. Lunch: giant spinach salad with cottage cheese, hard boiled egg, sunflower seeds, and cranberries. Afternoon snack: coffee and yogurt. Dinner: varies pretty widely, but usually falls around 400-500 cal range and includes &gt;15 g protein if possible. The weekends are less routine, but I've tried not to go too far over my calorie limit. Looking back at my [calorie totals](http://i.imgur.com/AQLuF.png) this round, I think I did a pretty good job avoiding binging.

* I ran C25K very regularly in the beginning of the round, but I was down to about 1 run per week by the end of the round. I lifted off and on, but not regularly this round. The daily challenges were a nice addition in the beginning. I'm really hoping to jump into them again next round.

* A one-on-one biggest loser competition helped me a ton. I had [this](http://i.imgur.com/OneAXl.jpg) message posted by my fridge the whole round. It worked pretty well in the beginning, but lost its effect toward the end. The competition itself really helped me to push hard in the last few weeks when I usually would have slacked off. 

Some setbacks:

* I injured my shoulder in R5 and it's still not completely back to normal. There's still some minor pain, and I'm worried I'll hurt it again if I try to work it out to hard. But I've been using this is a nice, convenient excuse to barely work out at all. A sore shoulder shouldn't really keep me from doing other exercises. If I can't do deadlifts and bench presses, I need to figure out something else to keep active.

* I lost my jump drive, which had all my weight, calorie, body measurement, and jogging data going back to R1. That put a damper in my motivation for a while, not being able to see my stats. I have all my paper records, but yeesh, I don't wanna type it all up again. So I'm starting fresh next round and I'm relying on LiveStrong plots until then.

* Barely any holiday setbacks this time. Valentine's and Easter and a couple birthdays, but no big meals to deal with. 

* Biggest setback this round was probably my laziness kicking back in. I barely went to the gym at all, maybe once a week or so, if that. And my workouts from home were super half-assed. I missed having a routine and a plan.

Some successes:

* Completely reached my weight goal! I barely set any other goals for Round 6, so it's hard to say much about the rest of my progress. I'm happy there was progress though, and it's way more progress than I thought I had made, so I'm gonna count it as a success.

* I signed up for my first 5K, which is on April 28. I'm slowly ramping up my running, maybe not fast enough, but it feels good to be running again at least.

Overall, this was a pretty good round. I feel less ecstatic than I did for some of the earlier rounds, but I feel like I made some pretty good progress still. Now I need to figure out what I want in the next round, but it's late and I need to get some sleep so I can wake up early and run... :/",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,True,,self1,True,t3_s3r7m,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/s3r7m/progress_round_6_results_and_round_7_goals/,

Failed on a final set?  Well, I went up 10 lbs since last week, so it's OK.  I'll get there next time.

What do you do to determine what went wrong, or even better, what went right?

Ahh, Bruce.  He's so right.  And as I'm reading this, I know that I need to get on the ball w/ exercise.  My dieting is still decent.

As for me, well, yesterday was pretty good trainingwise. I had the fastest run I ever had and finished the 5200m in less than 26 minutes with 25.47, which is pretty awesome I thing. After being injured so much getting progress again certainly feels awesome. Now with trying to lose weight, the heave lifts are still suffering (deadlifts, oooooh deadlifts) and I am still plateau-ing but well, forward I guess. After writing the Fitocracy charts I feel a bit more motivation, but still feel a bit low when thinking of my private live. Laura is sick atm and keeping the parents up with constant coughing in the night. Poor girl.

Let's talk vegetarianism / veganism! 

I know there are vegetarian subreddits, but I'd like to talk with my fellow 90dg vegetarians here anyway :) So, if you will; share your reasons why you don't eat animals, ways to do this, weird things and prejudices that cross your path, anything. Or just vent about silly people trying to make you eat meat!

I'll kick off with all of that ;)

I never really liked the taste of most meat, chicken and seafood. I always looked sceptically at the ground meat in the spaghetti, and took out the fatty and gummy bits.

As a young teen I went completely vegetarian, but.. the big yellow M got to me and my not-fully-ethical-developed brain. The sad truth. Years later, when I lived on my own I finally got it right and I've been meatfree for almost 7 years now (after years of almost). 

That resulted in a cranky boyfriend, whose dad was a butcher, yeah that didn't last too long anymore.

In 2008 I dated a guy who would purr ""ooh yum steak"" every time we'd drive by a field with cows. Sigh. He was super pissed off when I didn't want to eat his 'world famous pork'. ""oh come on, you can have a bite, that won't matter"". I even got slapped in the face with a piece of meat by one of his friends. Yeah good times. 

But it made me even stronger in me staying vegetarian. It also strengthened my empathy for the animals kept in the bio-industry; my main reason not to eat them. I don't want to have anything to do with this exploitation. I really have a problem with people looking at animals as a product. So, I am a very proud vegetarian.

Luckily my family and current boyfriend are totally supportive, which makes everything so much easier. Just, one aunt is convinced it's ""just a phase"" haha. Oh well.

Is anyone taking any special supplements?  I personally take a multi-vitamin, fish oil, Vitamin D, and Vitamin C daily, and when I'm lifting I add in creatine and beta-alanine.  Yes, I have quite the expensive supplement habit.  How about you?

Have fun today!

Why [another Buddy](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/oauvg/buddy_the_buddy_system/) post you might ask? Well, perhaps it didn't work out with your buddy, or you did not find anyone last time, or maybe you like to collect buddies like Pokemon. There are quite a few reasons.

The last post was quite a success, now let us see if we can have another great post up. A buddy can help you feel motivated, can become a friend, someone to talk to, or to share fitness tips / keep you both accountable. It is whatever one makes of it.

Day 1 is complete for me! I had a hard time with the last half of the workout because the impact of jogging was aggravating my foot injury (tendon inflamation) so I didn't do as great as I wanted. I am doing C25K as the cooldown to my strength training workouts for the time being, so I am still doing awesome!

How did your Day 1 go? I plan on doing Day 2 tomorrow because I have massive DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) in almost my entire body from back to back days of strength training. OUCH! Also, I firmly believe in rest days in between cardio so I don't injure myself!

1326645898.0,8,self.90daysgoal,oi2rh,"[Dailygoal] Day 7 - January 15, 2012",9,1,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/oi2rh/dailygoal_day_7_january_15_2012/,"Good morning/afternoon everyone and welcome to Day 7! How is your weekend progressing? How was yesterday? Did you hit the goals you set out for yourself?

I want to thank each and every one of you for checking in to yesterday's dailygoal. I **know** that listing things out like that can be very unpleasant. I am a firm believer in seeing things in print when it comes to obstacles and goals, making both something tangible and real. From there, we can set our obstacles to the side as we plan to overcome them, which is what we're going to try to do today.

* **Injuries:** Sometimes our bodies just can't do what we want them to, be it briefly or for our entire lives. The question is, what are you going to do about it? We can choose to do nothing, or we can find out what we **can** do, and strive to do it. I know it's not easy. I was personally paralyzed in a bad car accident 10 years ago and I was told I would never walk again. I didn't accept that so I did everything I could to work on what was in my control. I'm not saying all injuries can be overcome, but we certainly don't have to be defined by them!

* **Low self-esteem:** This is a very common issue, not just in our community but the world in general. There's always someone in life who needs to tear other people down in order to build themselves up. In my case, it was my Mom and her former boyfriend. I grew up believing I was worthless and I would never amount to anything. Coupled with the physical abuse, I am still battling their influences via therapy. It's not easy and I won't ever try to say there's an easy fix for emotional issues like self-esteem. What I can tell you is that **YOU** have the power to change things. We at 90DaysGoal are here for each and every one of you, all you need to do is reach out and someone will reach back. *I PROMISE*

* **Stress:** We've all got stress! Some have more than others, some deal with it better than others. It's a unifying theme in our group and it can either motivate us (I perform better when stressed, for some reason, when it comes to fitness), or make us curl up into the fetal position around a bag of Doritos. But, there are so many tools at our disposal for dealing with stress that we often overlook them because we're too deep in our own situations. Yoga, meditation, reading, drawing, distractions, therapy, counseling, talking with friends/the internet, going for a walk, talking a nap, having a bath...these are all things we can do, things that are in our power. We might not be able to schedule more hours in a day, or make our boss less of a prick, or have our toddlers suddenly stop being assholes, but we **CAN** give ourselves a mental and physical time out. Personally, I meditate and do yoga. When it's really bad, I take a glass of my favorite wine, a candle, some classical music, and I sit in a bubble bath for as long as I can stand. What other kinds of things do you guys find relaxing? Share your means of de-compressing when things get to be too much.

* **Laziness/Procrastination:** I am the QUEEN of procrastination and a super lazy person. I wasn't raised like this, it just sort of developed as I got into drugs and booze as a teen. As I gained weight, I perfected my laziness into a frigging art form! I have no advice for overcoming these two because I'm still trying to figure it out for myself. I find making lists helps, as does havingg a schedule and routine set out. I never stick to it for long though because I seriously am Sofa King lazy. Any suggestions for me and the others who need them?

* **Depression &amp; Grief:** This is a big one for me. When I lost my little brother 7 years ago, my world ended. My family fell apart and divorced, my Mom succumbed to schizophrenia, and I just fell apart. To have the boy I raised die in my arms was just so much more than I could bear. Add on another 6 people dying in the last 7 years and I was a mess. When I had my daughter, I was so stressed from lack of sleep and so paranoid she would die, I went nuts. Thankfully I have a very supportive (step)family, a wonderful husband, and an amazing doctor. I am now on anti-depressants and no longer suicidal. I've been through a bunch of therapy and grief counseling and I feel I am making progress. I no longer cry every day and things don't seems as bleak. My point is these things are serious and sometimes, we can't help ourselves. Turn to others when you're grieving, or depressed. There's no timeline for grief, but there are many signs that things aren't right. I had post-partum depression on top of everything and I didn't realize it until it was almost too late (homicidal/suicidal urges). I urge you all to talk to a counselor, your doctor, your family, and anyone else you trust. They key is to not keep it bottled up. There is **NOTHING** to be ashamed of, in needing help. Sometimes, we just need our brains reset, so to speak. Know that I, personally, am here for each and every one of you if you need to talk, no matter what. PM me, find me in IRC, add me on yahoo, or you can BBM or text me (PM me for the info). Know that you are not alone. I'm here and so are others. Phew, that was rough to type out, not gonna lie.

* **Going it alone:** Some of you are doing this without support in real life. I am sad that you don't have the support in person, but we're here. And you know what? The people at the gym support you. You may never talk to them, but I can guarantee that at least once a session, a fellow gym goer or a trainer glanced in your direction and thought ""good for them!"". And, as always, we here at 90DaysGoal are here for you!

Those are just some of the many obstacles we face. I want to see you all go back to the yesterday's post and reach out to those facing the same obstacles as you, to those who are facing obstacles you have already overcome. I'd also like to see you all offer solutions and coping techniques here to some of the obstacles I've outlined.

Personally, I would love to type about this stuff some more, but I need to head out into the terribly cold weather and go for a session with my trainer. Yuck!

Have a great day everyone and I'll be back later to respond to each and every one of you. That's my commitment to you here in Round 6. No comment will be left unacknowledged! &lt;3

The idea behind that is simple, the more you guys are in contact with each other, the more we get you to take part in here, the more stay with us in the end.

Personally, I have high hopes for this system and was a bit disappointed how it turned out in the last round. I know it has potential (as I have met amazing people), yet it somehow lost a lot of steam in the longer run.

Therefor we are going to do things a bit different this time.

First, I have to give a huge shout out to my fellow members of the Women Losing Weight team. This is an awesome bunch of ladies with very dedicated moderators who really helped me out through the round. 

I met my major goal which was to lose 15lb but I struggled with the others (Strength, inches, etc) due to injuries and illness. Unfortunately I don't have pictures for the round or measurements. I'll be sure to take these next time! 

Eating was a problem for me over the past couple of months. My bf has a decent job the first time in a long time and we've been enjoying that by eating out too much. I know there were a few burgers and fries that hampered my progress. Not to mention my coffee shop treat problem. This is something that I really need to control over the next round!

I mostly stuck to my exercise plan of spin, weights and yoga but lifting has suffered because of my back problems. I'm looking forward to being healed and going full throttle again.

I started the round at 166 lbs, and finished at 171, mostly due to weightlifting, lack of consistent cardio and holiday carb bloat.

Measurements:

* *Neck* - stayed steady at 15.25""
* *Chest* - 39.75"" to 38.75"" (-1"")
* *Waist* - 33.75"" to 33.5"" (-0.25"")
* *Hips* - 38.5"" to 37.5"" (-1"")
* *Thigh* - 22.5"" to 22.125"" (-0.375"")
* *Calf* - stayed at 15"" 
* *Bicep* - stayed at 14.125""
* *Shoulders* - 47.5"" to 48.25"" (luckily I wanted that one to go up! +0.75"")

My body fat % stayed at roughly 20%.

As for exercise, I definitely became stronger.  My 1 RM for deadlift went from ~365 lbs to 405 lbs!  Squat went up from 225x3 to 275x3.

So, what have I learned?

1. I need cardio.  My 20 lb weight loss last year was mainly due to running.  If I don't run, I gain weight.
2. While I love to lift weights, I need to do a big cut before I start lifting heavy again.  Once my tendonitis clears up, I'll be doing lighter weights with more reps.  It will slow down my leveling-up on Fitocracy, but it's better for me right now.
3. Alcohol is not my dieting friend.  Drinking needs to be limited to weekends only with rare exceptions.
4. If you want to lose weight, everything needs to be tracked daily.

1325037872.0,8,self.90daysgoal,nt12e,[PROGRESS] My first 90DaysGoal round completed successfully!,11,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/nt12e/progress_my_first_90daysgoal_round_completed/,"I've really enjoyed the challenge of sticking with 90 Days Goal this last round and am very glad I found it.  I'm pretty introverted/internally motivated, but every now and then I really appreciate having an external motivator like this.  There were often times where the thought of ""I have to enter my weight for the 90DaysGoal checkin tomorrow"" or the like succeeded in making me eat healthier and/or do a better workout (or even just do one at all).

My [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/kr92d/intro_this_is_the_perfect_supplement_to_starting/
) was pretty lengthy, but I'm really glad I could go back and use it as a point of reference.  A lot has changed since then.

First off, my husband is still smoke-free.  I am RIDICULOUSLY proud of him.  He is also taking steps to better himself in ways I have never seen in the 15+ years we've been together.  That in and of itself is amazing.  I know we are keeping each other inspired and motivated, which is also awesome.

Hit some pretty big bumps in the road in terms of stress/personal life.  My 3 year old was diagnosed on the Autism spectrum.  There's a lot more I could say about this, but one of the main things is that my motivation to be healthy and strong, both physically AND emotionally, is even moreso now.  I also surprised myself to find that I was actually CRAVING exercise as a way to blow off steam/reduce stress, in that I've always heard of people getting to that point, but had never before gotten there myself.

I am still using a completely unrestricted diet (calorie deficit, eat whatever I want), but have very much noticed I get hungrier when I eat more carbs, so I do tend to avoid them more than I used to.  But not completely =).  I still absolutely believe in moderation; I've eaten just about every ""bad"" diet item under the sun and done JUST fine.  I also had a 2% or whole milk flavored latte just about every damn day (my vice).

Still using numbers as my big motivator.  [Myfitnesspal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/karebearwsu), [running-log.com](http://www.running-log.com/calendar?athleteid=17458), and runkeeper have all been kept up to date, as well as my Excel spreadsheets (although I stopped tracking nutrition and only log measurements and exercise).

I saw the scale do a lot of interesting things over the last few months.  Definitely got more frustrated than I wanted to at times, because the numbers on the scale were doing things that it ""didn't make sense"" to (i.e. not getting smaller or sometimes dropping a lot quickly).  But every time, I stuck it out and eventually saw my weight drop.

Here's the comparison of stats from starting (plain text) and *ending (italics)*.

**Starting Stats:**

Height: 5' 6""

Weight: 223 lbs / *196.2 lbs*

**Measurements:**

* Bicep: 15.5"" / *14.5""*
* Waist: 43.5"" / *38""*
* Hips: 49"" / *45""*
* Thigh: 30.5"" / *28""*

**Fitness plan:**

* 40min Treadmill 4x per week / *45 - 75 minutes Treadmill 3x per week*
* Informally, walking if possible each day (walking the dog, to public transit center, walking to the park, etc).  I already do this most days. / *Still walking most days, I do NOT count this as exercise (in MyFitnessPal)*
* Eventually add strength training, such as pilates videos, push-ups, situps, etc on a casual basis. *Still haven't worked on this much.  I tried Pilates and hated it.  I am investing in a set of KettleBells next week.*

**Current Workout Progress:**

* Most recent [(September 24th, 2011)](http://www.running-log.com/workouts/1127905?athleteid=17458) run was 17 minutes at a 5.7 mph pace and 17 at 3.3 mph, with a 5 minute cooldown.  I alternated the 2 paces, with the longest stretch being 6 minutes of running. *Most recent [(December 27th, 2011)](http://www.running-log.com/workouts/1243986?athleteid=17458) run was 6 miles nonstop at 5.7 mph pace, with a 5 minute warmup and cooldown at 3.2mph.*
* I have walked somewhere (including a 2 hour trail hike) every day this week, and usually do most days.  This could become a challenge as the weather turns rainier. / *Weather is rainy, still a challenge, but I manage to stay busy.*

**Diet Plan:**

* Breakfast of non-wheat carbs (oatmeal, corn chex, etc) and protein (eggs or yogurt) and coffee (400-500 cal) (note, on workout days I ""treat"" myself to a latte vs. drip coffee w/ cream on other days) / *Nope, latte is pretty much every day without fail.  I often eat 300-600 calories in just food, but I adjust later in the day.*
* Small Lunch of a sandwich or soup (300-400 cal) / *Generally still true.*
* Snack of Veggies/Protein (like hummus &amp; celery or almonds) (150-200cal) / *I tend to skip a snack in lieu of a beer before bed.  I'm not kidding, either =).*
* Dinner as my ""flex meal"" (i.e. might be a treat if I did well the rest of the day, or might not) (600 cal) / *Also generally true.*

**Goals:**

* 199 lbs (just want to break below 200!) / *ACHIEVED! 196.2 lbs*
* Get to a pace and interval series where I can do a total of 3 miles of running in any one workout / *ACHIEVED! Longest nonstop distance is at SIX miles*
* run a 10 minute mile / *ACHIEVED!  Fastest mile is about 9:50, but I rarely do short workouts.  I actually ran an entire 5K at a 10 minute mile pace, something I never thought would happen.*",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,True,,,True,t3_nt12e,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/nt12e/progress_my_first_90daysgoal_round_completed/,

Laura is a bit sick again, this really does not seem to stop. Not much sleep yesterday as she has a bit of a fever but surprisingly today seems to go better we will see how this night goes.

And Feck is back. So how are you guys doing?

For me it is an up &amp; down, a back and forth. Tendency for the better though. Been a bit sick and having to work overtime till X-mas, had to skip workout due to drinking waaaaay too much on the weekend, but still today workout was more than good, really doing progress. I plan to start c25k this time with my wife as it seems my leg is slowly healing. We were at the doctor recently and I will get some physical therapy. Laura is doing better, well as it turns out her parents bad genes are showing. Some imbalances in her feet maybe from her fathers side and maybe some asthma from her mothers side. Could still grow out but we will see. Laura is always a bit behind but now we found one thing where she is trailing, which is puzzles. It is amazing and kind of strange to watch her systematically solve one of those. Pretty cool. As things turned out well with my car (sold it for an okay price, lost the papers twice but got them back in time, the oil leak damage was no biggie (as it could have been) at all) and presents are all set, there shouldn't be much stress besides the extra workload....what else, oh yeah due to the drinking of course not pregnant yet, but working on it. On the plus side, we were out with my sister and yep she seems to do well (due to the fact that her long term bf broke up with her recently).

1318950782.0,9,self.90daysgoal,lgca6,[Runners] Topic: Running Shoes,10,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/lgca6/runners_topic_running_shoes/,"This week's topic is running shoes - the various types of shoes, and how they can work to correct problems with your foot motion.

**Running Mechanics**

When you run, your feet propel you forward.  As your foot strikes the ground, your arch flattens, and you roll your foot to the side.  The muscles in the foot stiffen, creating a springboard to propel your next step.  Many runners tend to roll their feet too far to either side, experiencing either *overpronation* when the foot rotates too far to the inside, or *supination* (also called *underprontation*) when the foot rolls to the outside.  Each of these issues can result in injuries, but can be corrected via the proper type of running shoe.

[Pronation diagram](http://imgur.com/fYQex)

**Correcting Pronation via Traditional Running Shoes**

Today's modern running shoe was invented by Nike in the early 1970s.  Until then, most running shoes were more like ballet slippers or flat Chuck Taylors.  Phil Knight's design incorporated much more support and cushioning.  It also spawned a multi-billion dollar industry that now offers many types of shoes geared toward every type of runner.

Overpronators, who make up the majority of runners who do not have a ""normal"" neutral pronation, tend to be at risk for knee pain and injury.  These runners can reduce the risk by buying running shoes that provide additional stability and motion control.

Underpronators, who are relatively rare, suffer from lack of impact reduction due to the outward foot roll.  These runners are generally prescribed a heavily cushioned, and/or very flexible shoe.

**Types of Traditional Running Shoes**

Traditional running shoes tend to fall into three categories:

* *Cushioning* - generally used by mild over- and underpronators, as well as neutral runners.  They provide some additional shock absorption and minimal arch support.
* *Stability* - used by neutral runners and mild to moderate overpronators.  The shoes reduce the amount of inward roll of the foot.
* *Motion Control* - for moderate to severe overpronators.  They have stiffer heels and are specifically designed to help drastically reduce overpronation.

**Barefoot and Minimalist Running Shoes**

Pre-1970s running shoes offered very little support and thin soles.  You felt the road/track/trail with every step, and the only shock absorption came from the runner's legs and the only cushioning was from their midsole pad.  In hindsight, most runners also had stronger feet and very few knee problems.  They naturally ran with better form and a more natural midfoot strike (as opposed to the unnatural heel strike prompted by modern running shoes).  [According to Dr Daniel Lieberman](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1170253/The-painful-truth-trainers-Are-expensive-running-shoes-waste-money.html), professor of biological anthropology at Harvard University, ""A lot of foot and knee injuries currently plaguing us are caused by people running with shoes that actually make our feet weak, cause us to over-pronate (ankle rotation) and give us knee problems"".  The number of blown Achilles tendons has increased 10%, and cases of plantar fasciitis have dramatically increased.

The barefoot running movement is a reaction to the modern running shoe, and hopes to promote a more natural running style, resulting in fewer injuries.  Since most runners cannot run barefoot, the minimalist shoe was created to get runners as close to barefoot as possible, while still protecting feet from road debris.  The most recommended minimalist shoe on Reddit is the [Vibram FiveFingers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibram_Five_Fingers) (or VFF for short).  The shoe was originally design as a boat shoe, but over time has become a popular shoe for running.  Other popular brands of minimalist running shoes are the [Nike Free Run](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_Free) and [Saucony Kinvera](http://www.saucony.com/store/SiteController/saucony/staticpage?CID=Print-Kinvara&amp;content=Kinvara_saucony).

Usually I am quite upbeat but I am finding it hard to stick to the plan today.  It's easy to make excuses, but I think I'm losing control.

I'm stuck in a plateau which is really discouraging.  I've felt great about my body and what it can do, but I've stayed around 150-155 for two months now.  For the last week I've started having old de-motivational thoughts in my head, and started to hate on myself again, which I really don't want to do because it's so unhelpful.  At the same time, I wonder whether losing more weight will actually make me happier, although I'm generally a happy and optimistic person anyway?

Today I've had scrambled eggs with spinach, a coffee, and my delivery of fruit and nuts came which I absolutely dove into.  I feel like I'm stuffing myself and while it's with healthy food I don't want to do this.

I guess this is a cry for help - has anyone else felt this way?  

For information I'm 25, f, 5'7'', 154 this morning, I am highly active and aim to eat 1,333 cals per day net of exercise (so I eat my exercise calories). I haven't been bothered with quality of calories so much, but I tend to eat high protein and veg in the day and a carb-heavy meal at night.  Do you guys think I should stop eating exercise calories or eating carbs at night for a few days, to get things going again?  But the proviso to that is that I typically burn 400-800 calories every day, and I don't want to fall under the minimum line...

And either they're wrong, or I weigh over half a stone more than I thought I did. I started out on this 90 days thing thinking I was 178lbs, but apparently I'm 186lbs! 

This has totally fucked up my mood and my day. I have no idea where I started and so I don't know what progress I made this week, if any; as a former anorexic person, I still have some obsessive traits, and one of them is knowing exactly how much I weigh. 

I'm going to try not to let it disrupt or discourage me too much -- yesterday I tried on and bought some jeans in a size 14 (10 in the US) that fit me, which is a size less than my old jeans, so I still have that -- but I'm really pissed off with everything now, as well as being worried that I'm going to end up punishing myself via minimal calories this week instead of doing things healthily. I'm worried that I might not be able to control the pyschological impulses left over from before.

Okay, rant over...I just needed to vent my frustration XD Reading it through it seems like such a little thing, but I really do feel like shit. My goal is still 154, but now it seems so much further away.

**UPDATE: I tried to weigh myself this morning, and this time the scales said I was 180lb; and we all know that losing half a stone definitely doesn't happen overnight! So I put 1kg of rice on the scales and it said it weighed about 250g - scales are broken, will be getting new ones!

It is almost time for our first weight-in so I wanted to post some information to get people started on biking who may have never done it before. I, too, am pretty new to biking so essentially we will be learning together. First and foremost I wanted to direct your attention to an info session/AMA [here](http://redd.it/kwt3v) by a great redditor from [/r/bicycling](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling) to give us a primer/insight on biking!
__________________________________________________________
**If you want to be successful biking there are several things you must keep in mind:**

**1. Know your goals.**

**2. Success is made in the kitchen, not on the bike.**

**3. Find a routine to help you reach your goals.**

**4. Cycling is not the end-all, be-all.**
________________________________________________
**Know your Goals**
________________________________________________
There is a saying I heard once: 
&gt; ""An archer cannot hit the bullseye if he doesn’t know where the target is.""

I want you all to think about that quote for a moment. We all came to this subreddit because we have goals we want to achieve. We may take different paths to our final destination but we're all moving forward; some of us on bikes. First and foremost I hope you have some written representation of your overall goals; short term and long term because it will help you discover what you're trying to get out of bicycling. 

Some questions to ponder:

* Do you want to lose weight?
* Do you want to increase cardiovascular heath?
* Is your final goal to be in competitive racing or leisure rides?
* Do you prefer stationary or regular biking?
* Do you value distance ridden over intensity of the ride?

All of these things may lead you to different forms and plans in regards to biking depending on your answer. We'll get more into that later but take some time to consider your end-game. 

________________________________________________
**Success is made in the kitchen, not on the bike**
________________________________________________
Cycling is a great, low impact, cardiovascular work out. It is challenging and it is fun but it is not a miracle weight loss tool. Before you start biking you **must** figure out your diet. If weight loss is your goal you will need to run a caloric deficit. To get into specifics on diet please read the FAQs in [/r/loseit](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/loseit) and [/r/fitness](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness#WeightLoss) where you will get a crash course on dieting. Diet must come first or your biking stats and goals will suffer. An intense routine can't make up for poor nutrition. 

Even if your goal isn't to lose weight you, too, must focus on nutrition. A good balance of protein, carbohydrates and fats seem to be valued among the biking community and you need to keep a proper hydration and electrolyte level at all times. To inquire about specific dietary plans please feel free to contact our fellow brothers and sisters in the /r/loseit, /r/bicycling, and /r/fitness communities! they are very friendly and willing to help out.

So remember; don't go for a ride without diet applied. Figure out what's best for you and use your diet as a tool to accopany your biking to lead you to your goals. They are all interconnected. 
________________________________________________
**Find a routine to help you reach your goals.**
________________________________________________

There aren't very many definitive routines for bikers nor is there really a *best* routine. Here are a couple examples to options available for bikers depending on goal.

* [HIIT](http://evilcyber.com/fitness/primer-hiit-high-intensity-interval-training/) (High Intensity Interval Training)(Is usually used for running but [can be adapted to cycling](http://www.active.com/triathlon/Articles/How-to-Create-Your-Own-Interval-Workouts.htm)) - Fat loss
* [Tabatta method](http://www.active.com/triathlon/Articles/Go-for-Broke-with-Tabata-Intervals.htm) (Similar to HIIT) - Fat loss
* [Higher resistance biking](http://www.trinewbies.com/tno_cycling/tno_cyclearticle_07.asp) - Building some strength/toning muscles
* Liesure riding - Increase cardiovascular health/fat loss/keep your sane
* [High mileage biking](http://www.training4cyclists.com/12-hours-pr-week-training-program/) - Build endurance/travel/competition cycling

Keep in mind though that even if you're the most hardcore Olympic triathlete; biking is supposed to be fun and leisurely try not to forget that and don't be afraid of mixing up some different styles and routines to keep things fresh and challenging.

**Cycling is not the end-all, be-all**
___________________________________________________
If your end goal is to lose weight I have some heart breaking news. Biking alone will not get you there. Simply put, that while it is a great cardio workout and has many benefits it doesn't challenge your body in enough was for a full body workout and needs to be intermixed with other forms of cardio and weight training to be the most effective. Will you probably lose some weight riding? yes, but don't neglect other fun physical activities you can do too.

I hope this information has been helpful to get you started on examining what you want to get out of biking and how to get started. Regardless if you're sporting stationary bike or a top of the line road bike, get out there and ride, ride ride but first plan, plan plan.

I made some cheat sheets for popular U.S. chain restaurants in addition to some of my favorite local Italian, French, and Asian places.  The local restaurants won't be useful to you unless you live in Boston, but they should at least give an idea of the things that are 'okay' in that cuisine.        

I thought I'd take a second to sum up the challenges that everyone took on this week.  If you've been doing your challenge and have discovered something you think might help others, or if you're running into trouble and would like some advice or brainstorming, please do chime in!  If you're too busy, no worries - we can always catch up on Monday's thread.  

1. **Hyzerflip** and **scrimrot** were both going to try and figure out some strategies for prepping food ahead of time and not having to make every meal right when its time to eat it.

2. **steviewonderwoman**, **get_it**, and **soocie** were all focusing on not eating out/drinking out quite as much.  I gave what tips I could based on my 10 years of experience with keto, but I'm wondering how y'all are doing!?  On the topic of drinking on keto, I am actually planning to focus on socializing while on keto and paleo (in a few weeks), so we'll definitely return to that issue again.     

3. **tehmagwi**, **rule_16**, **ImTheTractorbeam**, and I were all going to work on menu cheat sheets so that when we go out to dinner we're armed with a list of 'acceptable' keto &amp; paleo menu options and are less likely to stray from the diet/don't need to sit there for hours poring over the menu.    

4. **akatch** and **itsreallyme** were going to do some pantry re-orgs so that it was easier to see all their food options.  I'm thinking I need to do the same to my pantry over the weekend to make snack foods more obvious/accessible!    

5. **simplyput** and **SirJohnEh** were going to tweak their diets a bit.  Simplyput was going to pay more attention to calories and macroratios; SirJohnEh got some slightly troubling bloodwork back after a few weeks on keto, and was recommended to reduce his protein intake, so he was going to mull over his best course of action.    

6. **godless_BeerFan** was planning to research snack foods that he could have handy, especially crispy snack foods.  Care to share your list?

Hope everyone's been having a great week and making progress!

*My Update*: This was my first week trying a relatively strict paleo-keto diet...I do miss cheese and dairy and peanuts a ton.  Saturday is my dairy 'cheat' day and you can bet my meals are going to be 98% made out of cheese.  However, I will say that eating paleo during the week has given me a huge appreciation for coconut milk (why has it not been a bigger part of my cooking before?!)  I made some pretty tasty dishes, and they tasted a lot lighter and healthier than the meals I usually make, even though they had the same fat content. My favorite dish so far has been a low carb version of the Puerto Rican mashed plantain dish called ['mofongo'](http://sixdollarsaday.blogspot.com/2011/06/mofongo-relleno-de-cerdo-rutabaga.html)...sooooo tasty.",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,,True,t3_i8e6l,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/i8e6l/paleoketo_menu_options_cheat_sheet_aaannndd_a/,

I was a little apprehensive because I sometimes find the dark green veggies like chard and kale a bit overpowering, but this turned out so good.

**Seared Tofu with Garlic, Swiss Chard, and Pine Nuts**

* 4 tsp pine nuts

* 1 tbsp soy sauce (low sodium if you'd like)

* 1/2 tsp black pepper

* 8oz firm tofu (I used lite extra firm) drained and sliced crosswise into 1/2 inch slices

* 2 tsp olive oil

* 2 cloves garlic (I used 7, love garlic)

* 6 cups swiss chard, rinsed well and chopped 

**Instructions**

Set a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When pan is hot, add pine nuts and sauté until golden brown, shaking the pan often to prevent burning, about 3 minutes; remove pine nuts from pan and set aside.

Combine soy sauce and pepper in a shallow dish. Add tofu; turn to coat. ( drained my tofu the day before, used extra soy sauce, and marinated the tofu overnight to really soak up the flavor)

Heat oil in the same pan over medium-high heat. Add tofu and sear until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Remove tofu from pan using a spatula and cover with foil to keep warm; set aside.

Add garlic to the same pan and sauté until just golden, about 2 minutes; (I had some diced onion leftover from another recipe and threw that in the pan first. When it was starting to soften, I added the garlic) add Swiss chard and cook until wilted, about 30 seconds. Transfer Swiss chard to individual plates and top with seared tofu and pine nuts. Yields about 2 slices of tofu, 3/4 cup of Swiss chard and 1 teaspoon of pine nuts per serving.

I plan to do a modified SL5x5 type routine 3 days a week and cardio at least 4 days a week from now on. Maintaining a rough calorie deficit of 300 to 500 per day (I don't count calories, that stresses me out more than anything else) and keeping carbs low. I sometimes binge on desserts, which sucks, but I can't help it. I'm also trying to quit smoking. I thought I had for a couple of months, but recently I'm back up to like 2 cigs a day.

It doesn't have to be refrigerated or thawed or anything.  And if you get it for 50 or 60 cents a can, you're getting a lot of protein for your buck.

A standard can of light tuna in water, drained,  comes to 191 calories and carries 42 yes 42 grams of protein.  There are 1.4 grams of fat, and there is no carbohydrate or fiber.  You get some omega-3 lipids but not nearly what you would from salmon; and if you're into that you might want to get albacore which has a bit more.  Sodium is there, 558 in a can, but you get some other minerals too like potassium 391, magnesium 45,  selenium 133.    But for those of you who like to eat the same thing all the time,  you can't just eat tuna every day, because it can accumulate too much mercury in your body.  But it certainly ought to be in your rotation of food.

I'm not crazy about fresh tuna as an entree, and I find the cost ridiculous where I live.  But if you're a seasider, you may know a great way to fix the fresh stuff.

Back to the canned stuff:  here's a few ideas.  One, you can eat tuna by itself at lunch, just drain and sprinkle with lemon pepper, eat with a fork, hopefully with some veggies or salad on the side. 
As for classic tuna salad: there are many variations on tuna salad, I even have had it prepared as a real finely ground pate.   I always had it the standard mayo-celery-relish route until a road trip with an adventurous chef.  He would add chopped carrots and green peppers, and serve on a bed of spinach.  Another good cook starts with the standard, and adds chopped green apple, unpeeled, or any kind of apple works.

To store tuna salad: pack it in the container so there are no air pockets, cover with plastic film pressed down over the tuna, then put the cover on the container.  This keeps it from oxidizing and getting an off flavor after a day.

So, how do you like tuna?   Share a good basic way to use either the canned or the fresh stuff!

For those of who not familiar with them, they do spicy grilled chicken, a few sides, and little else.  Not bad, and very quick.  I used to pig out on fries and spicy mayonnaise, but now I have the healthier options :)

So I went and got my usual - half a chicken, spicy rice, corn on the cob.  Water to drink, I'm good enough to avoid the free refills on soda!  I'm feeling very hungry though as it was an early start and a late lunch, so I decide to get an appetizer as well.  The houmous with chilli oil and pitta bread looks good, so I get that.  It arrives, it's a fair lump of houmous (an icecream scoop, it looks like!) and maybe 1.5, 2 pitta breads sliced.  I eat most of it, it's good, the chicken and sides arrive, I eat them, they're good.

So the chicken, it's grilled, it's healthy - 352 calories, 50g protein, 15g fat (yeah I ate the skin), 3.2 carbs.  All good.

The rice is pretty good too, 199cals, 4p, 5f, 34c.  Well it is rice, it's going to be a bit carby.

The corn on the cob, that's grilled too so extra yummy, and I leave off the butter.  139cal, 5p, 3.5f, 25.5carb.

So in total, 690 calories, 59g protein, 23.5g fat, 63g carbs.  For eating out, that's not too bad, and usually fills me up.

Oh, I forgot something.  That little appetizer.  The starter.  That little thing of homous and pitta.  Well, that can't have been much, could it?  Let me illustrate using a well known meme.

fross: What does the menu say about its calorie level?

menu: it's over NINE HUNDREEEEEEEED!!!

fross: Over nine hundred?!?  That's impossible!

That little sodding plate of homous, had NINE HUNDRED calories.  (well, 876).  28g of protein, but 32 of fat and 120 of carbs!  I could almost cry.  That's more than the whole rest of the meal combined!

So BE CAREFUL, a lot of appetisers are full of fat and salt, it makes them taste more intense, and those calories add up FAST.  Get a non-creamy soup or a salad with the dressing on the side.  Stick to your main courses, and be healthy!

I want to get a great bikini figure. Over the past 2 years i gained 8 kg of fat. I know that 68 kg by 1.72 m is normal weight but being a fit 25 year old and having a healthy bodyfat index is differnt.

My plan is to produce a calorie deficit of &gt; 600 kcal per day. My basic needs for my body are 1900 kcal of food which i will reduce to around 1400 - 1500 kcal of food per day. Due 3 x exercise in the gym (1 h) and 2 x swimming (45 min) i will save ca. 2000 kcal calories per week.
This leaves me with an average of a 5000 kcal saved per week. That means i need around 90 days to lose those 8 kg fat (aquivilant of 60,000 kcal saved). Here are some before pictures http://i.imgur.com/aoTEO.jpg. After 90 days I´ll take after pictures. 

What do you think about my dieting plan? Do you think my plan is doable? Should I set a lower goal maybe of 6 kg in 90 days? I have no idea how my body will react, because I have never been on a diet nor have I done any sports for the last 7 years.

I was in something of a funk.  For dinner, I had sliced portobello mushrooms cooked in low cal zesty italian w/ shrimp, tomatoes, onion, spinach and a pinch of low fat cheese + a salad.  It came out great and Im having it for leftovers today.  As for exercise, I want to get a good run in.  The only downside is that a cold front came in so Ill be breathing in cold air which I hate.

1290173010.0,8,self.90daysgoal,e8mry,[90dg] DAY 5 - “It’s Friday! Can’t I be a little bad this weekend?”,9,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/e8mry/90dg_day_5_its_friday_cant_i_be_a_little_bad_this/,"Yes! Sort of... You’re making changes for life, so you need to be able to have days to indulge in the things you love, otherwise you might go insane. BUT if you’re trying to make progress, you should still be mindful of what you do on the weekends!

**Foodsies**

You can be a little loose and free on the weekends, just try not to go too over the top. If you go *too* crazy, you can wipe out your progress for an entire week. Here’s my suggestion for the first couple weekends: eat like you normally eat and keep tracking *everything* on the weekends. For me, this was a real eye-opener. Between fast food, restaurants, and snacking, I found out that the “little” splurges that I made on the weekends pushed me up to 4000+ calories per day for Friday, Saturday, *and* Sunday. Those splurges wiped out any deficits I had built up over the week. Once you have an idea how you’re spending your calories on the weekends, *then* you can start figuring out where to cut back. You don’t necessarily need to completely eliminate things, just try to eat them in moderation. (Those cheesy buttery biscuits at Red Lobster, for instance - instead of downing a basket of them, I’ve cut back slowly to just one.)

Keep an eye on your weekly calorie totals. (If you use livestrong, your weekly summary is near the bottom.) If you’ve been good all week, meaning you came in under your calorie goal each day, then you have some breather room for the weekends. For instance, if you were 100 cals under your goal each day for five days, you can make the choice between 1) going over by 500 calories on Friday, Saturday, **or** Sunday, or 2) making some extra progress toward your goal.

If you decide to indulge on the weekends, try to limit your splurging to *one* day or even *one* meal. Or make a couple small, measured splurges throughout the weekend that add up. Whatever you decide to do to make your weekends more enjoyable, just be mindful of the calories and keep your goals at the front of your mind.

Alcohol! Who doesn’t like to drink on the weekends? You don’t have to give it up, but here are a couple things to keep in mind: 1) Alcohol has calories, and 2) your body will burn off alcohol before it burns fat. So make sure you include any liquid calories when you’re tracking for the weekend, and be prepared to see your weight loss slow a bit by Monday. Again, I think the key here is moderation. Since you’re trying to make yourself healthier, you might want to consider scaling back on drinking anyway, but that’s a personal choice. :)

**Activity**

You should have at least one rest day built into your weekly routine. If you work out every day, you risk burning yourself out or not giving your muscles enough time to repair and build between workouts. For me, I have rest days on Saturday and Sunday. But these aren’t days to sit on the couch *all day* doing nothing. Try to keep your weekends at least a little active. Pick something fun or relaxing that will still get you moving, even if it’s as simple as walking a bit faster around a mall or taking a walk through the park. If you’re more ambitious, go for a hike or a row or  play some sports with your friends. Any bit of activity on your rest day is better than no activity at all. Don’t feel obligated to go to the gym though.

**Weekends at 90dg**

Over the weekends, traffic at 90dg usually drops pretty low. There will still be YDG posts over the weekend though, and I encourage you to check in even if it’s just to say “It’s my rest day and I’m splurging tonight!” Checking in will help to keep your goals at the front of your mind and it’s helpful to see *other* people working toward their goals on the weekends too.

There won’t be a daily reading material post on Saturday or Sunday (unless someone else wants to post one - too much typing to do one from my phone). But we’ll come back full force on Monday with our first weekly check-in. If you don’t already have one, buy your scale and your flexible tape measure so you’re ready to update your stats on Monday!

As with all the reading material posts, I welcome any comments, questions, corrections, and additions! Good luck to everyone this weekend!",,False,self,t5_2s0sd,False,,self1,True,t3_e8mry,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/e8mry/90dg_day_5_its_friday_cant_i_be_a_little_bad_this/,
1288042055.0,9,self.90daysgoal,dw9zn,Round 2: It's time we get this party started.,9,0,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/dw9zn/round_2_its_time_we_get_this_party_started/,"This is quasi a summary of the [Round 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/dtc2j/round_2/) thread. Don't understand this as me highjacking this reddit, we should be all democratic about the points, so please give your opinions:

1.) It is about time we name new moderators and get them in the list on the right. Personally I would say baiser and/or katiekatums are the most active people here. So if they would do it, they would have my vote. Any other suggestions?

2.) November the 6th will be the official last day of round 1. We should all discuss when and how we proceed with the second round. My suggestion in that order:

- Celebration (or deep depression)

- Advertise the shit out of this subreddit for a few days (07-10th November)

- **Everyone** starts threads about their experience (nutrition, training routines, motivation), helping the newbies to chime in and to set their goals (10-14th November)

- Round 2 starts Monday the 15th November

- (no reason to stop training during introduction week)

Agree? Disagree? I stated in the first post to have a 2 week hiatus, but looking at the calender it seems 4 days should be enought to advertise. Any thoughts on that one? Start right with round 2 after one or two weeks?

3.) We could use a good text / or faq to advertise. We need a volunteer to write one. Anyone here willing to prepare something like this?

4.) One good idea from the previous post was to use [Livestrong](http://www.livestrong.com/groups/) to create a 90daysgoal group. That way we can have a similar goal we were working on as it supports group stats, which add an extra punch to the motivation. I would say it would be a good idea for us to join that site and set up the groups.

5.) To advertise better we could compile a group statistic to say something akin to ""We lost 100 pound in total in round one, reddit help us to loose 200 this time"". As far as I understood knioette was willing to put such a statistic together and will us asking about our data (is this correct?)

6.) Places to advertise in:

- r/fitness

- r/fittitbuddy

- r/IWantToLearn

- r/looseit

- r/twoxchromosomes

- Original 90 days reddit

- 90days Iama (is this a good idea?)
