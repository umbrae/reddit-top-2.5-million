-Minneapolis blog encourages people to attack cyclists with hot sauce and water as a chemical irritant.  Recently, one man was found after being attacked from a car with an unknown irritant:

""Patiently scout your surroundings, be sure to check for witnesses, and, when the time is right, slide open the door and pull up along side your prey.  Yell something like, “HEY SWEET TITS” or “YOU’RE NOT LANCE!” to get his attention.

When he looks over, blast him in the face from two or three barrels filled with the potion then race off before he has the chance to flush his eyes and get a glimpse of your plates.  Serves him right!""

""My wife was biking south on Minnehaha today (Saturday, July 6) around 4:15 p.m. when she encountered a bicyclist crawling on the boulevard and saying he was blind and needed water. 

My wife stopped to assist the man, as did some nearby residents, and she gathered that somebody had thrown some liquid at the man, presumably from a passing vehicle -- though the vehicle part is merely an assumption on my part.""",,False,self,t5_2qhyi,1373435621.0,,,True,t3_1hzojw,http://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1hzojw/minneapolis_blog_encourages_attacks_on_cyclists/,

Basically, I'm about 5'8, and about 240lbs, and not wearing it well. After a lot of thinking and some objective thinking, I realized I need to do something about this. I've started with the common sense stuff - ""Get yo' salad, no dessert"" as Kanye once said - but although the food stuff is going well, I need to team it with exercise. That's where the question comes in. 

I used to ride when I was younger (And a tiny bit slimmer) and I used to get shouted at by strangers about how my bike is about to collapse. I know some of it was piss-taking since my butt can't actually swallow a bike seat (...where would it go?) but I'm still nervous if I'm actually too fat to ride a bike. 

Is there a weight limit or anything? Any insight would be awesome.

I have a cervelo p4 and had to spend some time making it UCI legal but managed to figure everything out.
My goal was sub 39 minutes. The course was gradually uphill on the way out with a challenging 300 meter long 10% hill at the turn around.

I started down the start ramp, went over the first bump in the road and realized I had not tightened my saddle enough and my saddle angled down, causing me to slide for the entire race and putting way too much pressure on my shoulders. I was basically uncomfortable for the whole race.

The first half is more challenging and I did the first 13k in just over 18 minutes, well on pace to beat my goal. On a flat section of the course with about 10k to go, I had a bee fly into my mouth and sting the roof of my mouth extremely close to my throat. I managed to spit the bee out after getting stung but the stinger stayed in my mouth. Thankfully I am not allergic to bees, however I still was freaking out. I sat out of aero and tried to scratch out the stinger but every time I tried it kept getting lodged deeper into my mouth.

I was in an accident not long ago, where a car came in front of me and blocked me. At the moment I am discussion regarding the value of my bicycle, which is a 06 Trek Madone 5.2 Carbon in good condition(at least it used to be). They have agreed to pay for the loss, below is the estimate and how they calculated it. I feel the bicycle is worth more considering its condition prior to the accident. If anyone has been in a similar situation and has any advice for me, I'd greatly appreciate it.

&gt; I considered depreciation of 20% per year for a bicycle which is based off the average life of 5 years.
I took a depreciation of 80% which leaves an ACV of 20% of the current replacement cost since the bicycle is over 5 years old.
20% of ACV of $3,589 = $717.80

Depreciation rate seems high, the bicycle was well maintained.

I'm on my way home from work, around 7pm, it's dark, scraped snow on the roads, but nothing unusual. I don't have lights on my bike because every time I buy the cheap ones they fall apart. Shitty excuse.
Riding down a quiet back street, see a car coming from my left that has a stop sign.... by the time I realize he's not stopping I'm already too far into the intersection. I lock up front and rear, but it doesn't help.

The front of the car hit my left leg, and I guess I went up into the air and somehow landed back on my left side - hip and elbow. I know I'm OK at this point, but he has not even hit the brakes, so I think he's going to run me right over. Holy shit I've never been more scared in my life. I screamed to stop so loud my throat still hurts now. Of everything I've ever done in my life, the fear of going under the wheels of a car was suddenly very real.

I spring up, out of the way. He does stop. Old guy from out of town, had no chance to see me even in daylight I think. I'm freaking out cos I seriously thought he was going right over the top of me, so I immediately call 911 and the cops show up ~2 mins later.

They ask some questions for 5, then leave. Nothing happened. I walked home.

I'm fine, lost a good amount of skin in a few places and leg hurts but nothing serious. I think the bike frame is bent, hard to tell in the dark. It's a shit cheap bike, so I don't care too much about that. There are holes in my good winter jacket, which sucks.

As of late, the idea of cycling has slowly crept in to my mind. With my school being 7 miles away and my job being 6, I thought that with a bike, I can save on gas, car maintenance and invest in my health as well/. The more I looked in to cycling though, I saw all the cool things you can do to bikes, such as adding panniers and lights, and gps and computers and other cool things. hell, I even saw cool spinning light attachments for the rims, which would help make me visible at night, considering that I work late and usually end up getting out around 11 or 12.

Only problem though is, I dont have a bike just yet. I literally have no money to spend on a bike right now, but while searching, I saw this [Huffy Savannah Bike at Walmart](http://www.walmart.com/ip/700c-M-Savannah-road-bike-model-56760-black/12517029) which appears to have really good reviews from people. I really dont know what 700c tires are, or whether this bike is right for me since every person I talk to keeps telling me ""GET YOURSELF MEASURED!!!!!"" But I dont have the money to get measured. I saw somewhere that was charging like 125 to measure me. I was like ""that is more than the bike I want!!""

Doesnt help that my dad has a Trek 52001 120 Carbon series, which he told me costed him around 2500 bucks. I laughed at him when he suggested me a trek bike. I dont have anwhere near the type of scratch needed for a Trek bike. But let me ask you, this is my first real bike that I would be getting for commuting and shopping, I've had other bikes when I was younger, but that was only to riding to my buddy's house down the block. So I dont know, is that bike good at all? I have seen some youtube videos on it, as well as other sites that give it good reviews. is a cheapy bike good to start off with or should I invest more money? Will I be able to upgrade pieces as I go? Sorry, I didnt see anything on the sidebar to help out the new people.

I hope this isn't the incorrect subreddit for this question. 


When I bought my bicycle, I bought it as someone who really had no idea what he was doing. I bought a Marin Kentfield. It's a hybrid bike and it was in my pricerange. I thought it offered versatility, but I really find that it just disappoints, because I only ever ride on the road. 

I am considering commuting by bike to campus instead of getting parking passes ($360/year). It's not too far of a commute, but there are some pretty big hills.

I was wondering if you guys think it would be worth the investment to get a road bike (probably in the ~$700-750 range). Do you think this is a good idea? Will I notice a big difference over my current bike? Is a road bike my best option, or is there something that I am as of yet unaware of?


Thanks so much! 


(Here's a model, maybe not the same year, of my current bike: http://products.howstuffworks.com/marin-kentfield-bicycle-review.htm)

Also, I'm not sure how relevant this is, but I'm a big guy (230), and about 6 feet tall.


EDIT: I don't know if anyone'll see this, because this is kind of old, but I'll try. 

The reasons I don't like the Kentfield are these: I don't really like the geometry. I feel like I can't be fast or efficient on it. Also, it has suspension, but I never, ever use it. So I feel like it is a waste. Also, I have had problems with it before, and when I take it to the bike shop, my options are limited due to its design with fairly cheap parts. (I couldn't put a better wheel on the back).

What I would like is something without suspension, that would also be a bit lighter. I would like to be able to put a rack and paniers on it, almost certainly. I like having those a lot.

However, I also like to ride for fun. So while this would be a commuter bike, I also intend to ride around with my friends on the weekends. Lately I haven't been able to keep up!

1375909656.0,15,self.cycling,1jws7f,My experience so far (fairly long). I'll add a tl;dr at end,21,6,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1jws7f/my_experience_so_far_fairly_long_ill_add_a_tldr/,"Hi r/cycling!

I grew up biking. My first bike was at age 4. My first job was at age 13 in a bike shop. I loved biking. every check I got went right back to the store for more parts as I built my own bmx from the mongoose frame, I found in a trash bin, up.

When I was about 15 i quit biking to start skateboarding. 
between age 15 and 30 I only had one bike, a Dyno cruiser, which I hardly ever rode. 

When I was 30 I got a job that I felt I could commute via bike to. My friend suggested a single speed bike since they are light weight, simple, and my commute was more or less flat. I got a Felt single speed bike and immediately was considered a fixie hipster. Explain as I may that it is a single speed with a freewheel and brakes, I was still a fixie hipster. I only used the bike for small errands, short distances, I ended up not using it for commuting at all because it turned out the road was too dangerous (motorist dangers, no bike lane).

I'm 32 now. I started a new job with HP a few months ago and was notified about a fund raiser, a century ride fund raiser. I'm all about helping and volunteering, so I signed up. I've never done anything like this before, but I figured I'll give it a shot. I didn't have a geared road bike, but I figured I can just train on my single speed until I have enough money for a real road bike. GOOD LORD they are expensive! I spent a month checking craigslist every day for something my size, not aluminum (need comfort for 100mi ride), and within budget. Finally I found a deal! I bought a Specialized Allez Triple for $600! It is a little old, but for a first bike I think I did pretty good. This was last Friday. The next day I did a ride with some of the HP team, a cycling team called the vanderkittens, and some of the organizers of the Canary Foundation fund raiser. We rode through the hills of Palo Alto on a popular route simply known as ""the loop"". It was about a 20 mile ride. Quickly I realized there was no way possible I would have been able to do this on a single speed. It was my first ride, it was challenging, and rewarding, and I really enjoyed it!

The century ride is on September 28th so this only gives me about 7 weeks (?) to train. With that in mind I decided I will commute on bike to work everyday. It is a 13.5 mile commute each way along a designated, paved, bike path along a creek. The commute is really nice. it takes less than an hour, it is scenic, it isn't all that challenging, and I get to practice for the century.

What I've noticed - There is a different kind of comradery amongst cyclists than say, fixie riders. I rode that single speed for a while and never got a nod, a ""good morning"", a wave, a smile... On my road bike it is a completely different story. Everyone is super nice! Also, everyone is very careful about following the rules of the road and etiquette - not something I would associate with the fixie riders (i've seen enough sidewalk riding, crosswalk riding, wrong side of the road, running lights, etc...). Maybe it is a respect thing? I don't know, but I like it.

Anyways, it has been less than a week with my new bike and I'm loving it. Maybe I always loved it, but just never had the right bike. Wish me luck on my century ride, I'm going to need it! If anyone wants to make a donation here is the link - http://canary.convio.net/goto/ryanhatescancer

The bike I picked up on craigslist (sorry for blurry pic) - http://imgur.com/LhuhI3P

I've been commuting to work for a while with a hybrid bike, and just got a Trek Madone 3.5 (2012) to get more serious with road cycling.

I'm a bit of a data freak, so I like to analyze my rides and track my progress. But since I try to go on different routes as much as possible, because obviously variety is nice, I can't really graph my average speeds, because they depend on the elevation gain on each route.

Is there a software of a website that will either normalize my average speed by ascent/descent grade, and/or graph average speeds independently for each grade?

This way, I would know whether my average speed on the flat is increasing, and if I'm getting better on climbs.

Another question I have is about heart rate. I just went for a 2 hour ride (54 km, or 33.5 miles), with an elevation gain of 462 meters (1515 feet). My average heart rate was 172 bpm (I'm a 32 year old male, with resting heart rate of 55 bpm. I'm about 4 kg, or 8 lbs fatter than my supposed ideal weight).

Isn't that too much? Is it going to just get lower and lower as I train? At that heart rate, I'm almost constantly in my Zone 5, well away from the fat burning zone. I've tried going on slow rides to keep in the fat burning zone, but I literally felt nothing, and didn't even break a sweat.

Being a weak rider, I tend to sit on the back of the group, trying to catch whatever draft I can and hoping not to get dropped. 

So my questions are:

1) Am I right to think this group could do things better?

2) Is there a disadvantage in sitting at the back of the pack? (Sure feels like it, but I can't put my finger on why.)

I'll start off by saying that I haven't really ridden any bikes as an adult. I, of course, had a number of bikes growing up. Mostly BMX and mountain bike styles. Nothing ever too fancy. Wal-Mart brands and the like. I moved to Chicago six months ago and have been wanting to get into cycling. I mostly run for exercise and use the CTA for transportation right now. My girlfriend's mother's boyfriend (I know) had this bike in storage for at least a couple years that he got very cheap but never rides it. He offered it to me when he found out I wanted to start cycling.

I was surprised that he actually had the manual for the bike, and I gave that a read-through. I was surprised how conversationally it was written and the amount of good info I was able to glean from it. 

My quick research suggests that this bike was at least $1000-$1500 brand new and still worth quite a lot. The copyright in the manual was from 1996, so I assume that the bike was manufactured around the same year.

So, does anyone have any suggestions how I should get this bike into shape and start riding it? I think I'll probably have to get different pedals, as the ones that are on there require special shoes (I think). Also, the grip tape is all deteriorated, so I'm sure I can replace that. Also also, the valve on the intertube is really small. I think the manual called it a presta valve. Any tips on pumps? Any thing else on the bike that you guys can point out would be great. I know very little about bikes and how they work. I'm not even entirely sure I know how the gear shift works on this thing!

Thanks.

Need Advice for When to Lift what in Conjunction with Cycling

I am pretty sure I need to change the order of my workout days. The problem - my Lower back especially but also glutes and hams are too sore.

I am using road biking for my fat burning/cardio 2x a week, but that is aligning with my lifting to make a 4 day block of aggressively tickling my hinder (which I am not necessarily ""into"").


**Here is my current workout schedule:**

M - Chest/Bis (Bench Press)

T - 50 minutes cycling in 16-18mph range

W - Back/Tris (Deadlifts)

Th - 50 minutes cycling in 16-18mph range

F - Legs/Shoulders (Squats)

  
  

**Here is the problem**

T - Cycling causes lower back strain due to bent over position as well fatigue on glutes and hams.

W - Deadlifts hit the posterior chain and fatigue the lower back, glutes and hams. Bent over row relies on the lower back to stabilize.

Th - Cycling (as above)

F - Squats clearly hit the glutes and hams (lower back is fine here) and then lunges clear up the rest of my ability to function.


**The result -**
 I walk like a weirdo way longer than the normal walk like a weirdo for a day after deadlifts that most guys I know deal with.

My goals: Get pain free while getting stronger at deadlifts and squats (neglected them for years) and lose 10 pounds.

I am trying to get things to line up so that I am not doing too much on a given day as I am running at around 2000-2300 calories a day vs 3300 maintenance (I am 6'6"" 250 looking to hit 240 soon). I can handle the deficit mentally, but I don't want to kill myself.

Taking all this into consideration, should I just go ahead and put cycling on the same day as chest/bis in order to move it away from deadlifts? I really want to keep doing squats - buy maybe actually do cycling on M and F and just use the squats as the only leg move for that day?

If you were in my shoes - what would you do?

I've filed a police report, and am getting security footage from a business across the street from where this happened.  I'm hoping to find the ignorant asshole who did this and have them punished.  I've had this bike since 2008, and ride it practically any day that there isn't a foot of snow on the ground (I live in St. John's, so even in May it's a possibility).  I'm absolutely heartbroken over this, but want to take the experience and make it positive by really learning about bikes work, and putting it back together!

So my question is, do you guys have any advice for someone who wants to rebuild this bike?  It's a 70s Peugeot, 55ish cm frame (I haven't measured it, so rough estimate. I'm a 5'8"" tall girl, really lanky, this bike fit me perfectly).  The handle bars, derailleurs, tires, crank, and back brake are all fine.

I get super sweaty in my jackets and it's the most uncomfortable feeling being wet and sweaty inside but cold as hell on the outside. Is there a jacket that is breathable/absorbing that won't make me feel like I'm in an oven in an igloo? 

I have a budget ~200, I'm willing to pay for something of quality that will last. Wouldn't really like to go over $200 unless necessary.

Ideally this jacket would have a good amount of pockets, maybe one on the inside for valuable items. Bright. Reflective material. A drawstring hood. Protects neck. Wind-resistant. Keeps heat in (but not baking), and keeps cold out. 

Also I need gloves. I currently use these shitty fingerless knitted gloves. Although very warm for casual use, it's not ideal to lose feeling in my fingers when riding. So I need a fully protective glove that is wind-resistant, super warm, yet slim enough that I won't feel like I'm wearing oven mitts. Would be cool if these are in a bright color with reflective strips or something. Would like to pay no more than $30 for this.

I met a cyclist who rode at my pace at the very start, so we hung together the whole day. We took it pretty easy and came in at 7:45 with a pace just under 13mph. I tried not to attack the climbs, but that didn't last so I just went for it. I'd pass a bunch of folks only to have them pass me right back once we eased back into the flats. We took our time at rest stops, even taking advantage of the chiropractor on hand at mile 75 for some stretching. I could have pushed myself a lot more, but finishing feeling good was more important to me. 

Thanks so much to everyone for their advice! Looking forward to the next one. :)

I am a 30 year old male. For last 5/6 years I do desk job and don't do much physical exercises. So I have become somewhat unfit and overweight (not so much; BMI=27). Recently, I have decided to take biking seriously. My plan is to start smooth and rough it up. Initially I wish to travel 100 km/mile in 2 months from now and go up as much as I can.

I have a road bike not a touring bike so ill be bungee cording my bag to an back rack which means ill have to be going light unless I invest in P-clips

IAmA Former Marine getting back in to shape, 25 years old and in generally good health - 6'1, 200 lbs. I am quite lucky to have a bike-friendly community, and an easy 5-6 mile commute to work which is ~75% packed/paved bikepath, and the remainder (beginning and end) paved road. Many of my coworkers and customers (I'm a bartender) are avid cyclists, several of whom ride on sponsored teams in the area and many who make ridiculous money delivering sandwiches on their bikes to the downtown area where we work. For that reason, I'm attempting to not only use the bike for commuting, but also for riding with friends on some longer and more road-based treks (Obviously harboring no notions that a beginner will be able to ride at their level with any sort of speed).

After consulting with many of them, I've settled on a Cyclocross bike, which should get in this week/weekend (Specifically, a Marin Toscana: http://www.marinbikes.com/2011/bike_specs.php?serialnum=1175 ). It seems like the best fit for my needs at the moment.

Anyone have advice on additional ear I still need to purchase? I've got the obvious (Helmet/lock/light) but I'm wondering what you would suggest I purchase as well? I'm already looking into a pair of cycling shorts for longer rides. Also, I'll be riding a lot at night (Again, bartender commuting) and wondering if TWO sets of lights would give me any advantage? Or is that just unnecessary overkill?

Any additional advice you feel a beginning rider/commuter needs to know?

Thanks in advance and apologies for asking what are most likely novice and annoying questions.

EDIT: Midwestern state here, so pretty temperate climate. As far as the rain goes, I don't mind so much. I can change at work and plan on keeping a few extra sets of clothes there anyhow.

I just moved to Bloomington Illinois, a city with a great cycling community. I used to be a distance runner, but due to bad knees, I've decided to switch to cycling.

At the local shop I got a really great deal on an old Schwinn Le Tour ($200, well maintained, rides like a dream), and I picked up a phone mount so I can use my mobile as a computer to track time, distance, and get me home if I'm lost.

So, I have two questions. I want to get in really good cardio shape - I've been aiming for around 1 hour in the saddle every day, and I might look into HIIT if that doesn't get me in the shape I'd like. An tips or ideas for biking for cardio? Not a lot of hills (read:none) near me, so it's mostly just flat, long, rides.

Second, what should I look our for next? I'm using old running shorts, t shirts, and running shoes now. I have a helmet, and a great pair of sunglasses. I don't make very much money, so part of me wants to save up so I can spend on winter gear and ride year round. What kind of items are essentials? Once I'm totally moved in I want to get a saddle bag, tube, and portable pump so I can do some real long weekend rides and not worry too much about breakdowns. What else should I look out for?

I've had it a while, but.. well, I'm one of those people who has a gym membership and never uses it. I'm sick of being out of shape, but thanks to 10 years of smoking, don't have the lung capacity to run. I've been cigarette free for 3 months now, and I'd love to get on the bike for at least 30-60 min a couple times a week. A couple things I'm worried about, though. 

* I don't really understand ""correct pedalling"". I usually throw it into 8 and just push hard. 
* The area near me is mostly flat, but I'd like to go on some longer rides that involve hills. How should gear shifting work? Higher gears on downhill, right?
* Attire - I should be alright wearing gym shorts and a tshirt, right? 
* Belongings - I really don't want to leave my phone, wallet, bike tool and a knife at home. Any tips on storing these? There was a ""commuter"" option for these bikes from Performance, that included a back rack. 
* Bringing my bike to work - A car rack, duh! Any tips on locking it to the rack to keep it safe?

* **Update**: Something I remembered when riding yesterday: The bike is only an 8 speed. I feel like that might be a performance/exercise hinderence. Even just riding down the flat street, I feel like I'm spinning my pedals at 1000000 rpm unless I'm in 7 or 8.

I commute around 50 miles each week with my laptop and mini u-luck, plus some random things like a fresh t-shirt, kindle, power supply, bike tools. Occasionally I pick up a few grocery items on the way home. I also take weekend trips.

As for my current setup, I own a messenger-style Timbuk2 laptop bag ([the Command](http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/command-laptop-tsa-friendly-messenger-bag/2114704)), but it hasn't been doing the job for me. The bag shifts to my side when I ride unless I cinch it so tight it makes me uncomfortable around my collarbone/neck/shoulder. Capacity and organization-wise, it's great, but I am thinking of selling it because I enjoy cycling more when I use my much smaller but not so tough [MONO Expander Pack](http://www.monocase.com/store/pc/Civilian-Expander-Pack-p2962.htm). The capacity and organization on this backpack is not bad, the laptop protection is great, the design is beautiful, but the toughness is nowhere near a true cycling bag.

I'm looking for the perfect cycling backpack that will be:

1. tough,
1. won't shift around while riding,
1. will protect my laptop with adequate padding and is weatherproof
1. has at least 20L capacity (so it can handle what I'd pack for weekend trips) but isn't so huge it would feel bulky around town
1. aesthetically pleasing?

I'm hoping you guys know of a bag that I don't, because I've already done quite a bit of research. I've looked at and almost purchased:

1. [Chrome Soyuz](http://www.chromeindustries.com/bags/laptop-bags/soyuz#readmore)
1. [Chrome Bravo](http://www.chromeindustries.com/bravo)
1. [Chrome Welded Rucksack](http://www.chromeindustries.com/welded-rucksack) (new for Chrome's Spring line)
1. [Timbuk2 Swig](http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/swig-laptop-backpack)
1. [Timbuk2 Q](http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/q-backpack)
1. [Mission Workshop Rambler](http://missionworkshop.com/products/bags/backpacks/roll_top/medium_rambler.php)
1. [Mission Workshop Fitzroy](http://missionworkshop.com/products/bags/backpacks/rucksack/fitzroy.php)/[Fitzroy VX](http://missionworkshop.com/products/advanced_projects/vx-large-rucksack.php)
1. [Mission Workshop R2 or R6 + Arkiv Laptop Case](http://missionworkshop.com/products/arkiv-system-bags/)

PROS and CONS of each:

**Chrome Soyuz**: PROS - laptop pocket with side-access, organizational pockets, u-lock pocket, waterproof main compartment, chest strap, accessory loops on straps, super tough material. CONS - main compartment is too deep and rolltop opening is too narrow, can't easily find things. Built in China.

**Chrome Bravo**: PROS - expandable upwards, laptop pocket, organizational pocket, waterproof main compartment, external compression straps, chest strap, accessory loops on straps, super tough material. CONS - main compartment is expandable, but potentially awkward for cycling when looking behind for cars. Made in China.

**Chrome Welded Rucksack**: PROS - all of the above for Chrome. Laptop functions as a separate case with organizational loops. CONS - not expandable, a bit small.

**Timbuk2 Swig**: PROS - laptop pocket with side access and drop protection, lots of organizational potential, chest strap, cheap. CONS - the style is ""hip,"" not really my thing. I am more into the muted, minimal look.

**Timbuk2 Q**: PROS - same as above. CONS - same as above, plus it doesn't seem as tough as Chrome or Mission Workshop.

**Mission Workshop Rambler**: PROS - doubles in size and compresses down very nicely, great fit, chest strap, laptop compartment, very high quality stitching, urethane-coated zippers, super tough material, beautiful bag, lifetime warranty... and made in the USA. CONS - no organizational pockets, everything goes straight to the bottom of the abyss of the bag, including the laptop compartment which means no drop protection. Expensive as hell.

**Mission Workshop Fitzroy/Fitzroy VX**: PROS - all of the Rambler qualities except doubling in size. CONS - same, laptop compartment seems like an afterthought. Expensive as hell!

**Mission Workshop R2 or R6 + Arkiv Laptop Case**: PROS - all of the Rambler qualities except doubling in size. The most aesthetically pleasing of all the bags. Laptop sleeve also functions as a separate case, which is nice but not necessary. CONS - even more expensive!!!!! Have to sell a kidney for this one especially if I want the other accessory pockets...

I know this may seem like overkill but I figure if there is anyone who understands, it is the cycling community...

I picked up an old Raleigh from the habitat for humanity store today and I'd like to restore it to rideable condition. The bike is in really remarkable condition given its age (~40 years); looking at the pads and normal areas of wear I'd even go so far as to say its never been ridden. 

That said there is some serious grime build up and the cables are pretty slack. My plan is to give it a proper strip down and cleaning, lube &amp; grease (if needed), and straightening out some bent parts. The original dunlops look nice but are extremely cracked, and the pads are dried out. 

The tricky part for me us that it has a sturmey archer internal 3 speed hub which I know nothing about maintenance for. It will go through the gears but takes way too much force to be healthy. 

I'll post pics here for reference.

I am moving to Salt Lake City in January from albuquerque NM , where you can ride (snow-free) basically year round. I am typically a fixed rider but as my rides get longer and longer I am considering the jump to a geared bike. I would like to only get one bike, a road bike, but am worried that if I do, I will not be able to ride at all in SLC until April.

1320259374.0,12,self.cycling,lxz2d,Noob question.... Bikes for the whole family...,13,1,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/lxz2d/noob_question_bikes_for_the_whole_family/,"I'm planning on buying some bikes for my kids, myself and my wife. I've done a bit of googling and have a few answers, but I was hoping to get some insight from a bike enthusiast. In responses, please provide a highly budget concious response. I can (and probably will) buy new bikes on credit, but I want to minimize this as much as possible. If I can get a perfectly fine bike at wal-mart for half the price of the uber high quality bike at a bike shop, then I want the wal-mart answer. I'm also mechanically inclined and good at following instructions so if the cheaper route involves labor of me putting it together, I'm all ears.

First, the kids:
The kids are 5 and 9. Neither one of them are good bike riders yet and this is due mostly to the fact I haven't taken them out on their bikes as often as they like. I have a strong feeling the bikes they currently have are too small for them. According to this chart: http://bicycling.about.com/od/howtoride/a/bike_sizes.htm

Based on height instead of age, my son should have an 18 inch bike and my daughter should have a 24 inch bike. In measuring the bikes the kids currently have, is this measuring the inner rim on the bike or the outside of the tire to the outside of the tire? It's possible I could spray paint my daughters bike (it's pink) to a color my son would like and let him use it, but I've also heard there's a structural difference in boy vs. girls bikes... something I'm not sure I understand or if it's really worth caring about since he'll outgrow it in a couple of years anyways. Feedback?

As I mentioned above, neither of them are strong riders so I want something that will be easy for them to control probably at slower speeds. If they get good, then maybe a faster bike down the line. I expect them to be mostly biking on sidewalks and other flat surfaces for a while. What should I look for and where should I go to get their bikes?

Now for me:
I'm trying to lose weight. I've been doing good at staying on a healthy diet and getting a modest amount of exercise on a daily basis which I have been slowly ramping up. Biking was on my to do list from day 1 and I'm about ready to bring it in. I have bad knees and my ankles don't support me doing running and walking for more than 2 miles. Biking is perfectly fit for me because it doesn't put more stress than my knees and ankles can handle and allows me to get out of the house. I'm at about 290 lbs and would be using the bike mostly for exercise purposes, but I might look for an occasional bike-a-thon/fun race here and there. I'm not caring about speed as much as I am about durability and just getting to the finish line. I expect to be sticking mostly to roads and sidewalks. I'm willing to pay a little bit more for a bike for myself since I expect it would be the right size for much longer than one for my kids. What should I look for in a bike and where should I go to get it for maximum bang for my buck.

And for my wife:
She is more overweight than I am, but I don't know her exact weight and I don't feel like sleeping on the couch in order to find out. If I had to guess I'd say 320ish. When I've touched on the topic of getting bikes she has shown interest in doing the same thing. I think if she gets into it, she'll be in the same type of needs as me, but I am skeptical that she'd ever join a bike-a-thon (but then she might suprise me). As with myself, I'm willing to invest a little bit more in a bike for her with long term expectations and all so I pose the same questions with her in mind....


**UPDATE:** So it turns out my in-laws have a pair of bikes they don't use. They were offered to us so I took them to the bike shop and the verdict is they are in pretty good shape. They need minor work that I can do myself and new tires so I'm ending up with a pair of road bikes for myself and my wife for less than $75 in parts.",,False,self,t5_2qhyi,True,,,True,t3_lxz2d,http://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/lxz2d/noob_question_bikes_for_the_whole_family/,

A bit of backstory - feel free to skip.  I haven't been in the saddle in a long time, due to just being busy and a million other reasons.  I have a road bike that is in decently working condition, a project bike, and a mountain bike that needs front brakes.  I lost 50 pounds in 12 weeks cycling like crazy 9 years ago, and I am thinking about taking advantage of some of the areas around Waco that seem decent for cycling.  

I'm going to reel off a shitload of questions.  Answer any or all if you feel like it.

1)  I need a helmet.  What should I be getting?  I am a cheapskate (mainly because I'm broke).  I used to just go with one of those stupid hats with the flipped up bill, you remember those?

2)  I have a broken brake set on the front of my Trek mountain bike, and I don't know what to get.  Are those fairly standard?  They just screw in to the assembly or something?

3)  I'm getting older, so I'm a little worried about protecting my prostate.  Is there anything I can do?  (I saw a prostate-protecting seat, and it looked like plastic-coated fail.)

4)  I used to like to listen to music while I rode.  This is a bad idea, right?  

5)  On my road bike, the shifters are down on the frame, and I'd like to move them up to the bars/brakes.  Is this going to be pretty hard?  I'm kind of handy, but I've never worked on bikes before.

I'm not great but in relatively good shape.  I'm by no means a natural athlete and don't expect to win any races or anything.  I bike with some other guys and one thing I notice is how much I vary in performance day-to-day while everyone else seems far more consistent.  Maybe 10% of the time I can hang with them and pound up the hills ready for more.  40% of the time I'm having my 'normal' days - struggling along on the back end. 50% of the time I'm just way down and am embarrassed to be riding.  For the life of me I can't figure out what's wrong.  I've monitored sleep, food, activity levels, hydration and there doesn't seem to be any  correlation.  
  

My bad days are just this dreadful feeling of fatigue once I start riding.  Up until I start riding I have no idea if it will be a good or bad day.  I'm not particularly panting but my power is down for a given heart rate.  My legs usually feel fine, there's just no energy no matter how hard I want it.  Other notables: 

* Age = 39
* Weight = 150
* Very regular headaches  (tension/tmj)
* Relatively poor lung capacity - probably due to pneumonia when I was young.  
* After a hard ride I can have phlegm in my throat that causes me to cough and hack for a few hours.  But during my ride I don't feel like I'm wheezing or short of breath.  I got an asthma inhaler but it made no difference.
* Testosterone level tested as normal
* Food allergy test didn't turn up anything.
* It's not lack of calories, carbs, etc.  

I know you aren't doctors, but any ideas?  

UPDATE - I'm NOT looking for training ideas for getting in shape, but physical reasons as to why I am so variable.  I know we all have good days and bad days - but I know no one who is half as variable as me.

Another cyclist stopped by to make sure everything was ok, helped the actor to the grass with the actor's friend, all the while I fixed my rim so I could ride home. As soon as the other cyclist leaves, the guy who hit me jumps right up like nothing happens and starts demanding my info. I continue to refuse and straighten my rim until ridable.

-I have visible quads in addition to visible calves

-continued weight loss

-I just got a job. Why? So I can afford a nicer roadbike.

You guys were totally right. I want a new bike. And bike shorts and a bike shirt and pedals I can attach my feet to. I've gotten into this in a big way--hell, I've gone from nothing to 60 miles a week inside a month!

 The ONLY problem I've had is a little twingey knee pain, and I have chondromalacia. I have PT exercises I can do that will probably make it go away--and if it doesn't? Oh well. It's not like I don't spend all winter with arthritic knee pain anyway.

My friend recently gave me a free Ross road bike from the 80's which has standard flat pedals and no toe clips whatsoever. If I upgrade to clipless pedals, my concern is being stranded in the cleats. I read online that it's basically impossible to walk any distance wearing road bike cleats. I bring my road bike with me on business trips and sometimes ride 10 to 20 miles from the hotel in rural areas. I normally have absolutely NO ONE to call to pick me up if the bike breaks down in the middle of no-where and I have to walk a long distance, and taxi cabs aren't always available. My AAA membership is no help either, as they only help motorized vehicles. Bringing regular shoes in a back-pack all the time seems like a huge inconvenience; I absolutely HATE wearing a back-pack and bring my tools with me in a small carry-on bag. I can fix a flat tire, but probably not other problems which may leave me stranded somewhere!

Has anyone had any experience with this? Is there any pedal system that can allow me to pedal more efficiently that does not require wearing cleats?

I am completely new to cycling so apologies if I sound clueless. I am currently on the look-out for a bike that will get me to/from work (3 miles each way ~ a few hills but mostly flat) and through a 50-mile charity ride. I would love to be able to buy myself a commuter bike and a road bike but I am currently a graduate student. 

I have looked through Craigslist and there appear to be no decent bikes in the 52/53cm range in my area. If they are decent, they are beautiful and really out of my price range.  

After speaking with people at the local bike shop, I came to the conclusion that I was going to buy a hybrid bike this year and then once I get more experience, invest in a proper road bike. 

I have a few options based on bikes available at local shops. The only bike that I have tried (on this list)  is the Fuji Absolute 2.1. 

* '13 Fuji Absolute 2.1 (with discount should be ~ $410)
* '13 Trek Verve 1 (~$470 including taxes)

The good thing about the Fuji lies in the fact that the bike shop is super-close to me and the people there were great. (I can't praise them enough about their service.) If anything were to go wrong, it would be fairly easy to get to them. I'm going to test-ride the rest this weekend and then make a decision. 

In the end this bike will probably end up being my commuter bike, but I would like a decent bike to start off on for a few charity rides. I am a 5'7"" female with long arms/legs but that would prefer not to ride a female bike (those paint jobs... really? - most of the female bikes that are actually stocked in stores are too small anyways). 

If you guys have any suggestions as to which of these bikes to avoid or if there is one that really stands out, please let me know. If there are any other bikes within the price range (&lt;$500), I can also be on the look-out for those.

I started riding a road bike a month ago. It all started as a means to loose weight along with my new eating habits. Turns out, I really like cycling and decided to stick with it. 1 month ago today I started on an old 10 speed I got for free and a used mag trainer I bought. I managed to do 15 min on the ""low"" resistance level. Last week the 10 speed started to give out on me so I purchased a new Norco road bike. For the past few days I've started doing a 9.7km route through some hilly areas. I'm ecstatic that I can even ride 10k now(I do have to stop for a break on the big hills), however, I am a little concerned in the fact that I'm not sore after I ride.

About 7 years ago when I was much fitter I use to run, not habitually, and was always very very sore afterwards. It made me feel like I was improving at least. With cycling I only got that after the first week.

I noticed the difference.

So when I was younger (11-12) I used to bike ride with my dad quite a bit. I remember it wasn't that hard for me and I could quite comfortably ride for a couple miles, the longest ride I had done at the time about 7 miles. This was with a cheap bike from Target that was heavy as hell.

Now I am 17 and I need to get in better shape so I want to start bike riding again. My problem, my endurance is garbage. Just today I went on a ride that was a little over a mile (1.1) and when I got off the bike my legs felt like they where light and weird. During the ride I started to get a burning in my legs maybe a third of the way through and my knees started to hurt just a bit after that. I have to constantly stop pedaling to stretch my legs out so the hurt goes away.

The bike I have is a Trek FX 7.3. I am 200lbs (trying to lose weight but I have been stuck at 200 for a few weeks now, the reason I want to start riding again) I am 70 inches tall. I don't know what my cadence is but I wasn't being leasurly about it.

Sorry this is so long and a rather noob question but I just wanted to be detailed about my problem. So any advice on how to build up my endurance and possibly a way to relive the pain I get in my knees when I ride for only a short time. From what I read that problem comes from improper seat height but I cant seem to find the right height. I just can't believe how bad I seem to be at riding from when I was younger.

I've been looking into power meters for some time now. Researching everything I can. In fact my PI is probably a little upset about how much time I spend looking at all of the options out there.

After looking at all 4 types (ibike newton, look keo pedal, srm or quark cranks, power tap hub) I noticed that all give a different reading or interpretation of the cyclists power. ""Duh!"" you might be saying by now. But look at the different types. One is responsive in a forward direction, another responsive in the reverse direction, and two are what you exert or what you put into the bicycle itself.

So which one do you choose? Well, if you have the money, why not all? 

I was thinking about some simple mechanics, power in and power out. Naturally there is a breakdown between the energy put in, transferred, and put back out. Things like mechanical resistance, flex, heat, other sources of friction, tangential forces... all kind of things between your feet and the back wheel that hits the road. Each part having some coefficient of absorption, portions of your effort are never used to move you forward. Minuscule, but additive, I suspect that for each bike there is a maximum transfer efficiency from foot to wheel and that is the best training zone for overall power efficiency. I haven't been able to try any as I'm on a graduate student income. 

It could be as simple using a crank and hub power meter to determine the ratio of power in to power out (≤1). You could potentially use all four types to see how much power is lost at the front of the bike.

So my question is - has anyone actually tried this? I've spent several hours trying different search phrases/key words, but nothing has shown up.

TL:DR? Has anyone used more than one power meter simultaneously in their training? This could be a neat way to follow your training.

This past July 1st, I found a crack at the top of the seat tube of my 2007 Cannondale CAAD9 frame. I took the bike to my local Cannondale dealer to get the problem taken care of under the lifetime warrantee. After having the dealer hold the bike for the entire month, Cannondale claimed that the damage was the result of improperly storing the bike with the seat post out and the post clamp torqued down (which was preposterous) and tried to make me pay them $500 to live up to their warranty. The shop guys were shocked and I told Cannondale to bite me.

I decided to get a new, custom frame because of the great frame builders in Boston and constant fit issues resulting from long legs and a short torso. I went with [Firefly](http://fireflybicycles.com) for a couple of reasons:

* They have a ton of experience building bikes despite being a new company.
* Their bikes look awesome.
* I got to work directly with them when designing the bike.

Jamie, Tyler, and Kevin were great throughout the whole process and even invited me to watch the frame get welded. I couldn't be happier with how working with them went and they built me an amazing bike. It responds exactly the way I want it to but is still incredibly comfortable.

The final kicker is that while my Firefly was being built, I filed a complaint against Cannondale with the MA AG requesting consumer mediation. Once they started getting letters from lawyers, Cannondale changed their tune real quick and sent me a new CAAD9 frame - albeit without bothering to tell me, the consumer advocate, or the shop - which I built up with old parts into my winter/rain bike.

**TL;DR:** Cannondale tried to screw me, sent me a new bike anyways, and I got an awesome new Firefly that I couldn't be happier with. ",,False,self,t5_2qhyi,True,,,True,t3_mb67r,http://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/mb67r/my_new_firefly_and_why_i_gave_up_on_cannondale/,

What's your ride like? Is 13K too much, or do I just need to get in the habit? When you hit up hills, do you also stop and take breaks often? Also what's your average speed like? After a while, do you just go on the lowest gear? That's what I do.

Physically, I know I can endure 100 miles. The only thing I'm worried about is the weather. The high is supposed to be around 80, which I can deal with, but any higher and I'm not sure that I'll be performing at my best.

I see this as a kind of milestone. =)


ETA: Just got back from the ride! Everything went swimmingly. I stretched at all of the rest stops, and right now my legs don't have that heavy 'after long ride' feeling. The weather was fantastic. The high was 75, and it was sunny. We had a nasty headwind for the first fifty miles (it was around 15-20 mph with gusts), but the worst headwinds make the best tailwinds. Storms started moving in around mile 60, and near the end of the ride we were literally surrounded by fronts, but the worst we got was a little bit of a drizzle.

I did the ride in just under 7 hours. My average was 14.8-- a little slower than what I usually ride, but I think the distance and miserable headwind might account for that.

What kind of bike should I look into buying? I've looked on craigslist and I'll see a basic looking bike for $50, then see some ehh looking bike for over $1200, obviously I'm clueless. I also have an old bike that has not seen maintenance in many years, it needs new tires for sure. How can I see if this bike will fit my needs? I'm also a little over 6 foot, so this bike might not be large enough for me.

How should I handle bad weather? My plan is to if its raining, I'll get wet. I'll get a waterproof backpack and store a change of cloths in there. I'm also wondering about what should I do to my bike to prevent it from rusting, or any other bike problems that could arise from riding in the rain. Most importantly though is how do I make sure some car doesn't run me over when there's poor visibility.

Are bike lanes safe/worth it? I live in a city that is notorious for bad drivers, so I'd like to be as safe as possible. I can can choose a main road with a bike lane and ride that, or take a road without one and ride on the sidewalk. I'm 99% sure it'll be legal, but I'll also be double checking.

Also feel free to point me in the direction of anything you would feel is useful.

1373264494.0,9,self.cycling,1hulac,I want to be sub 20:00 on the Old La Honda climb this year. Help me with a training plan,10,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1hulac/i_want_to_be_sub_2000_on_the_old_la_honda_climb/,"Hello reddit,

I would like to be able to make the Old La Honda climb (a very popular climb in the Bay Area: http://graphics.stanford.edu/~lucasp/grade/oldlahonda.html) in under 20:00. I will start training on August 5th. This gives me 21 weeks to get to my goal.

I don't expect anyone to come up with a comprehensive workout plan for me, but I would like to be guided in the right direction as I make my training plan. Here's some info about my composition and exercise history:

    gender: male
    age: 22
    height: 6'4""
    weight: 160 +- 5 lbs
    body fat: 5.3-7.3%
    previous experience:
        - 3 year collegiate rower (we trained on the order of 15 hours per week)
        - cycling as of February this year
        - rock climbing as of March
        - comfortable with compound lifts such as the power clean, deadlift, and squats



Currently, my best time up Old La Honda is an unimpressive 25:00. For my training plan I was thinking of doing 3 week cycles with lighter weeks at the end of the training plan. On each light week I can climb OLH as a benchmark. I'd like to lift 2-3 times per week, and occasionally go rock climbing with friends. Here's a very rough draft of how many miles I'd like to ride each week.

    1  : 50
    2  : 75
    3  : 100
    4  : 65
    5  : 90
    6  : 115
    7  : 80
    8  : 105
    9  : 130
    10 : 95
    11 : 130
    12 : 155
    13 : 105
    14 : 130
    15 : 155
    16 : 110
    17 : 135
    18 : 160
    19 : 125
    20 : 125
    21 : 125

This is a 3 week cycle. When I originally got my bike I tried riding 200 miles per week after a few months of very little exercise. It did not go well. I have no problem putting in a lot of hours for training, but I don't want to get burnt out.

So, here's my random collection of questions:

1) I'm aware that the power/weight ratio is generally better for smaller people. I think I'm a corner case here, since I'm tall and very light. Do I have a good body composition to be a strong climber?

2) How many feet should I climb per week?

3) Should I be on a 3 week cycle throught the training plan?

4) Would it be worthwhile to switch in other cardio such as rowing or running?

5) How often shoud I lift?

6) Should I do more or less miles?

It's been about 8 years since I've ridden my bike, and about 7 since I've outgrown it. For this summer, I must travel ~4km (one way) four times a week, and I think it may be time for me to invest in a bicycle. This will certainly be a healthier and more economical alternative to driving, but I have no idea where to start on my search. 

I do not expect to purchase a bike that will outlive me; I would like something reliable that could comfortably survive a few years of casual use. I expect to mostly ride on paved roads and some trails. I am trying to keep my cost at $300 or less, which looks to be a very easy range to to find mediocre bikes in. I am a 6' tall male and weigh about 170lb. I do not plan to ride aggressively this summer, but if I get hooked, I may take the bike back to school with me come September. From what I know, hybrid or road bike may suit my needs. My friend recommends a mountain bike as a good all-rounder, and I've found some relatively inexpensive ""comfort"" bikes which I know very little about. What should I look for when picking a bike, this doesn't seem as simple as comparing numbers on some spec sheets.  

At the moment, I cannot afford new (or even second hand) equipment from a bike shop and will like to make do with what is available at department stores and trusted online retailers. These are the bikes that I found on sale at Canadian Tire:

So I found a couple of used bikes on craigslist, and honestly, I don't know what to look for and ask questions about. Can you guys help me out?

The journey would take me about 3500 miles, I plan to do it over the course of 3 months or so.
As I was saying my knowledge of cycling is very rudimentary, I've been  doing a little research but its hard to come by good relevant information. Things I would like to know include what type of bike, panniers, tools would be appropriate. What sort of spare parts I would want to carry. If someone has done this before, mentally, what things I should be prepared for, a training routine I would want to adapt. Best foods to eat/ travel with. Maybe just some cool things Id want to check out along the way.

I've been doing Starting Strength for the last three months and am making appreciable strength gains. I am still in novice land, though (lifts correspond to novice territory and I can recover in a day), so I am looking at continuing with this for another three months. I'm also a road cyclist and riding season is coming up, which for me is usually five 100-mile rides, between two and four 125-150 mile rides and a bunch of smaller excursions (50-75 miles) in between. Thus, I would like to start focussing on my long-distance (100+ miles) endurance. I care much more more about finishing than finishing them quickly.
While reading Rippetoe/Kilgore's Practical Programming book, I came across an interesting note about sport-specific programming. According to them, high-rep, lower-weight (50-75% 1RM) movements help improve muscular endurance while allowing for strength gains on strength-building days. The way I'm reading this, this means that if I want to be fit and ready for the summer, I can (or should be) programming my rest days for this lighter work while continuing to use the Monday/Wednesday/Friday split for the Starting Strength programme and topping it off with a nice, long (50 - 100 miles) ride on the weekend.



Is this way too much work? If it is not, I'm thinking of doing squats, power cleans and rows on the off days for 3 sets of 12 at 50% 1RM, as these exercises seem most applicable to my sport. Is this a good idea? Or should I just stick to an hour on the trainer on my off days?

I spent the past hour thoroughly cleaning and reoiling everything, pumping up the tires, and wiping it down from where it had been sitting for the past year or so; then readjusting the gear tension wire things so that the gears changed fluidly as I rotated the pedals with my hands. All the while checking the chain and gears for any kind of damage I might have missed in the past, but to no avail.

****EDIT**** Thank you all for your absolutely wonderful suggestions. So I took your advice today and wanted to update you on the results. When there was more than one lane, I rode in the middle of the right-hand lane (American, fyi). Drivers were great about moving around me. One fucker slowed down on my left and hurled profanities at me, but I calmly raised my middle finger at him (thank you ElDudeBro, dhwebb, and jugglist for the suggestions of being more aggressive).  

I added more reflectors and lights to my bike and my body to become more visible (I ride in the dark on the way home from work). It's hard to know how much effect it had, but I'm sure it was useful. 

I also used more communication with the drivers around me, using more hand signals and making eye contact. I  thanked those that were courteous and gave the stink eye to those that were not. 

Overall, my experience was WAY more positive. I felt confident, I felt like I was demanding the respect I deserved, and most importantly, I felt like I was making the best decisions as a bicycle commuter to be as safe as possible. You all are great. /r/cycling needs some more love!

\#2 at about mile 35. I realized at this point that I did not have my patch kit. Yes! I had a few offers from solo riders for their only spare tube, which I refused. Ug, making the call to the wifey for a pick up... when a wild PYT appeared out of nowhere and offered her patch kit. Awesome. Down to work. Snake bit, requiring 2 patches. Challenge accepted. I confidently waived on the countless other cyclists that offered help. Done!

Got about 50 yards before the patches failed for round 3. I suck. I couldn't find the hole on the first tube. The 2nd was a mess. Clock was ticking.

Within about 2 minutes, a group of spanish riders came along and offered help. Amongst them they had several spares and offered one to me. ¡Muy bien!

CBS cares, so what did we learn today?

* Carry more than 1 spare tube. They're small and light. Really no excuse. Plus, you'll have an extra to help out another in need.

That all said, I don't want to do any of it really, and I already have a new bike, which leaves me with a couple options:

* Try to sell the bike as a ""fixer,"" making it clear to the buyer the extent and source of the damage

* Sell the components off separately, since all of them are in near-new shape (it was a brand-new bike)

I'm not sure if you will be able to help me, but I guess it cant hurt to ask. I'm looking for places to stay and riding buddies along Adventure Cycling's Atlantic Coast route. I am a collage student and this is my first BIG tour. A friend and I will be leaving Maine around May 19 and head South to Florida. However, my friend will sadly be returning home June 15 so I have been looking far and wide for new companions. I plan on 50 to 60 laid back miles a day, taking random adventures as they come. Budget is limited so cooking, camping and couch surfing is gonna be the way to go. A few people have contacted me and will be joining and dropping out from different points along the route. The plan is to make it to Orlando by July 19th. It really is just an adventure. I'm excited to meet new people and see new places. So are interested in riding, or you know of nice families I could possible stay with or camp in their back yards, that would be AMAZING! Anything helps, and if anyone is interested have them e-mail me and I will give them details.

happy cycling!

And I love it. Compared to what I've had before and what I've ridden, I absolutely love this bike. 

I've encountered one slightly large problem, the gearing. I don't know a whole lot about mechanics of bicycles, it says it's a 50/34T which I believe may be a compact double. 

My issue is the hills, I'm not doing so well in them. I've handled hills OK in the past as early as last year. I live in Kentucky, long rides will include lots of hills. 

I'll be doing a 100 mile charity ride, which I did last year on a steel frame 80's bike. Gearing didn't feel that bad, I certainly didn't struggle with it aside from crawling a heavy steel frame uphill. 

But now, I'm noticing my low gear isn't quite as low as I'd like, and in order to keep the pedals soft enough to not destroy my energy going uphill, I have to keep a higher cadence, which in itself is destroying my energy going uphill. 

So my only idea to remedy this is to convert to a triple crankset. How difficult/expensive is this to do? Or am I being a chump by not training differently to get up to snuff with this gearing I currently have? That 100 mile ride is in September, and it is rolling hills through the Kentucky country side, I don't know the exact elevation gain, but it's hill after hill after hill.

While going up steep hills, I switch to my smallest gear (sorry if I lack the biking jargon), but after a few pedal strokes, the derailleur shifts me back brutally to the largest one, making the climb a painful and slow torture. I won't argue that it builds leg muscles, but fitness aside, is this normal? Is it a warning sign of a potentially dangerous problem with the bike?

I'll take it to a shop next week but considering I'm a bit clueless about bikes and google searches didn't give me much info, I fear I'll be preyed by greedy bike shop mechanics!

I live in a suburban area and there's lots near me to do. I figure that I will mostly be on the road, but am not opposed to trail riding if I really get into it. 

Went to a local bike shop today and was introduced to a [Specialized Hardrock](http://www.specialized.com/us/en/bikes/mountain/hardrock/hardrocksportdisc29) as well as a [Trek Wahoo](http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/bikes/mountain/sport/29er_sport/wahoo/#) and even a Norrco. 

I seriously can't afford to spend a grip of cash to get into it, so I am looking for something fun, low(er) cost. Thanks for any advice.

So much so standing still they form a 90 degree angle to each other, each one pointing out at about 45 degrees. I can actually walk with my feet pointing almost backwards!

Riding my mountain bike, this is not a problem. When on flats I'm constantly adjusting stance and they can point outwards anyway, and when clipped in the slope of my top tube doesn't get in the way of my knees.

On my road bike with the more parallel to the road top tube however... Well, 3 rides in and I've already dented the top tube with my left knee. The bike is the right size, but when my feet are clipped pointing as straight as I can get them, my knees cannot go anywhere but inwards. I try to not hit the top tube, but inevitably they do.

Just wondering if any other duck footed riders have figured out how to avoid something similar without destroying their knees.

Also, for the time being I've been swapping my MTB SPD pedals until I get a pair of road pedals. Are there other pedals that offer more adjustment so my feet can point out a little more? I'm not tied to Shimano and was thinking of trying either some Time or Crank Bros pedals.

That picture doesn't do it justice. 

It was a damn monsoon.

I finally had to take cover when the hail started falling and I almost lost my bike in fast running flood water along the street, but finally made it home (2 hours late).

It was so much fun (except for when I didn't see the manhole cover and nearly broke my hands when I hit it full on. Ow!).

When the tornado sirens started going off, I took cover at a hockey rink near Wings Over the Rockies (Air &amp; Space Museum), but it was still a blast. The tailwind before the storm had me blazing at 40 mph with hardly a peddle required. A cyclist daring the headwind laughed at me.

I love mountain biking. Been doing it for a while now and I've had my fair share of falls but I never considered stopping...until a week ago. My front tire got caught in a ridge at the end of a line and I fell, hard. The doctors were worried I'd compressed my spine or worse and that I might never fully recover. Luckily, I walked away with a compound fracture of my clavicle and one compressed vertebrae. They say I'll be back to 100% eventually and that I'll be able to ride again but even thinking about clipping into my bike makes me feel panicked.

On that note, for some reason, I have started to feel very claustrophobic using clip in pedals. I'm just looking for advice on what to do. I know it sounds dramatic but mountain biking was a constant in my life and without it I am beginning to feel lost.

I'm currently in the market for an entry-level road bike and have been looking at countless numbers of different brands and models. Most I've seen come with Shimano Sora components. They seem to be very good except for one hitch - the shifters/brifters. Since they use those thumb levers that protrude out of the hoods instead of the levers underneath the brake levers, shifting while in the drops may be an issue.

I have a couple questions:

* Are they THAT big of a deal?
* How often do you shift gears from the drops?

I'd love to hear answers from sora owners and road cyclists! :)

I've recently finished building out my bike (now called The Frankenbike) from various sources, most of which is old second-hand stuff. Including new brake levers, cables, and grip tape I've only spent about $200 on this project and I'd like to continue the frugal trend with some cleaning supplies.

The chain, gears, and springs in the brake calipers are all quite gunked up after probably not being cleaned in many years by the previous owner of the frame so I'm looking for a cheap way to degrease it and lube it back up.

I've found lube recommendations that are about $10, which is fine, but I've got a really hard time justifying dropping $80+ on a bottle of degreaser... Any recommendations on something cheap? I live in Ottawa (Canada) so I'm mostly looking at local shops like http://www.mec.ca/ and http://bushtukah.com/. This is probably a stupid question but.... would WD40 work?

2. I ideally want to purchase a Hybird but somehow it gives me very limited options &amp; in same price-range I get to see those tempting MTBs. But I am not sure if I really need those considering I am just going ride in city.

I've found that my family is very much against me doing an upcoming century ride across our state.  Their main concern of course is that I'm going to be hit by a car and all that aftermath.

I'm trying to stay firm on my intent to do this ride but the guilting has gotten out of control.  They have been through a few tragic deaths and are beside themselves as to why I would ever consider putting myself in any type of risky situation. What additionally doesn't help is that they had the unfortunate experience of seeing a biker get hit in a freak accident.

I've looked up accident reports and statistics and have noticed that a larger portion of accidents that I expected are the result of the biker not adhering well enough to the rules of the road/having alcohol in their system/trying to maintain high visibility/etc.  This leads me to believe that if you take every precaution and pay attention (particularly in intersections) there's a good chance you'll remain unscathed. And of course I'm not saying drivers aren't at fault, they often are.

About a month ago, I was fitted for a Fuji Absolute 2.1. The salesman told me that I was a medium and the bike didn't seem too big or anything but I didn't have a means of getting it home (was going to a bar afterwards) and so I didn't get the bike. Fast forward to Friday when I actually get some time off from work and I step into the shop again. This time I get a woman who remembered me coming in last time and asked me what I was sized at; when I said medium, she was like ""ohhh no, try the small medium"". I did and it also appeared to fit ok; she said the Medium was meant for someone around 5'10"" and it was too big for me. Excited with the idea of having a bike, I walked out with a Small/Medium.
But now I am scared that I actually bought a bike that could potentially be too small for me. I have taken it for a spin and nothing seems off but then again, I don't know enough about bikes to know if something is terribly off. 

I keep finding Youtube videos for how to fit the bike you have to your height but none that are really good for telling if the bike fits you well. Also, the online guides aren't visual enough. 

If anyone can point me in the right direction just so I can sooth my after-purchase anxiety, please let me know.

I had an ancient (1970s) era bike for a while, but sold it when we moved across the country (USA). This time we both want bikes but don't want to break the bank, so I figured we might find something on Craig's List. We want newer bikes, but don't want to spend too much (definitely under 1k). 

* What brands should we look for or avoid?
* What are the red flags I should look for when I go to see a bike? What should I do to make sure I'm not getting a lemon?
* What flaws should I look past? What parts can I easily/cheaply replace and therefore shouldn't impact my decision?

I picked up a [Nasbar Carbon Road Bike](http://www.nashbar.com/bikes/Product_10053_10052_533667_-1___202339) when it was on sale a few weeks back for $899. It seemed to beat the specs of anything I could find at a LBS for the same cost (not even figuring in tax, etc). Most bikes in that range were bottom of the line Aluminum frames with Sora. I figured with a carbon frame I'd be in a better position to upgrade components as I go versus buying another bike down the line for a frame upgrade.

I realize it has some to be desired in the componentry (tiagra, and 105 on the rear, and I'm thinking shortly I would like to consider upgrading some things now that I'm pretty hooked and I know I won't mind pumping some money into it over time.

For the moment I am just riding solo, and not racing but I would like to branch into bi's and tri's. I did a 54 mile ride this weekend with room to push more, though I'm probably still in the casual and beginner class. Here's a link to my [Log for that ride](http://runkeeper.com/user/13643732/activity/158106631). TL:DR 54 miles, 3hrs40m

 I have little to no experience on road bikes (this is my first) so I'm not even sure what to say feels lacking, I don't mind my bike as is. The LBS that did a tune up on it said the only really meh thing about it was the bars. 

Is there a best path of upgrading components to get the most benefit?

First, what speeds are relevant? I assume the speed you see most often while cruising isn't, since it doesn't include starts, stops, etc.  

Like today, I did a 30 mile ride by my house, bike path, in 1:34:20 door-to-door. I'd post relevant elevation information if mapmyride wasn't giving me errors. Let me just say it's FLAT. Flat enough to never have to shift off of my 50T. 

Apologies if I seem overly concerned about speed, but I was a competitive swimmer for 12 years of my life, so having a firm, concrete metric like times is something I'm very used to. I like the ability to see (non)-linear progression of training, and the ability for instant comparisons using the relevant numbers.

Well recently I've come across some trouble by way of fixing the thing up. I hastily tried to tighten the spokes, which my or may not have been the source of my troubles. The first, and decidedly smaller of problems is that the wheel isn't quite true anymore. If anyone could explain which side to tighten to true the wheel, it would be much appreciated.

The larger of the problems is that part of the tire doesn't fit flush within the wheel well. [These](http://imgur.com/rOUwU&amp;YKOsg&amp;MVQ5jl&amp;fZlmY&amp;oDD96&amp;PGasd&amp;YO2sX) are some pictures of what I'm talking about. The bulge is worst in the 3rd picture. The last two show the opposite side of the wheel. The 1st picture shows the part of the wheel where the tire is flush. 

The bulge is on the order of millimeters, but it's been enough to derail the tire and pop the tube once. I took the tire back at the suggestion of my biking friend, and the new one bulges as well. I would expect this is an issue of the spoke tension, but I've tried tightening and loosening  the spokes to no avail. 

Bonus question: are the spokes in tension or compression? Appreciate it, fellas.

I purchased this bike a few months ago and haven't done anything with it yet. This is more so out of fear of damaging anything as the person who sold it to me did so at a great price and for a specific reason. He wanted to see this bike back to its old self and not parted out. When I purchased it, it was in pretty decent, not to say that it did need work. I have yet to start on anything really just some work on individual parts. 

Almost everything on the bike was Campagnolo Nuovo Super Record. The seat, stem and handlebars were Cinelli. The bottom bracket and drop outs were also Campagnolo, which leads me to think that this was a pretty serious bike for its time. I can't find anything as far as a serial number, or identifying aspects besides the badge. There is a Columbus seal on the seat tube. The badge has a portrait of a man with Romolo Lazzaretti arching over the top and smaller unreadable text. On the bottom of the badge there's a small wolf facing left. As far as I can tell the white accents on the bike were added on later. 

What should I do with this bike? I've never restored anything myself and I don't want to damage anything any further.

I'm looking at getting a cyclocross bike with my cyclescheme voucher over the next month.  I had originally decided on a Genesis Croix de Fer, but due to an unfortunate and painful story that didn't happen.  Anyway, now the 2011 models are coming out this month, so I'm after some opinions on what to get.

So far my choices are:

* Genesis Croix de Fer - £1100.  I rode the 2010 model and really liked it.  As far as I know, no changes for 2011 except more expensive :/  Steel frame, disc brakes, Tiagra set with some 105.
* Genesis Vapour - £900.  Aluminium body, Tiagra/Sora set.  Like the look/colour of this one.
* Kona Jake the Snake - £1250.  Aluminium body, Carbon fork.  105/Ultegra set.
* Giant TCX 1 - £1200.  Aluminium body, composite fork.  SRAM Rival set.

Originally I could have got a Croix de Fer for £900, which was a good deal.  At £1100, it seems you can get a better spec bike for not much more money.  The Jake the Snake would be top of that theoretical list, but I've not ridden it yet.

I plan to do commuting and some light off road with it.

Four times a week I cycle somewhere between 30 and 40 miles at full speed; no coasting except for when the downhill is too steep to sensibly pedal. My bike is a Kona MTB with slicks because my routes usually include a couple of miles of fields. I usually eat and drink the right stuff beforehand and take about 1.5 litres of water on my bike. Occasionally I go cycling having eaten nothing so as to prepare for bonking

So that's me. I'd really appreciate it if the experienced cyclists on here would do their best to answer the following questions for me

1/ How much extra effort will it be to complete a century without stopping?

2/ How do I carry extra water? I use almost all of my water during my normal cycles and I don't want to dehydrate

3/ I'll be using energy liquids and gels of course. How much should I take?

4/ Can I expect to be walking the next day?

If you could give me any help on this it would be great, along with any other tips that you think I might need. I'd really like to complete the century and still be in one piece at the end of it.

I'm 25 and a college student.  When I registered for fall classes a few weeks back, transport was not an issue.  However, my city changed the bus schedule and now it won't work, and its too late to change my schedule.  I've decided to tough it out, and bike to school.

A little backstory-I got diagnosed about 3 months ago with arthritis in my left hip.  I was running before that 2.5 miles several times a week, but since the news I haven't exercised at all (I got kind of depressed).  I heard cycling was a good thing to get into and is arthritis friendly and was planning on taking it up, but I have kids and was home with them for summer so I didn't get any practice at all.  College starts in less than 2 weeks.

My college is 8-9 miles away, depending on route.  The 8 mile route is a highway (speed limit 50), the 9 mile route is a 2 lane road, one lane for each direction (not sure of speed limit, probably 35).  Neither has much of a shoulder or a bike lane (think *maybe* 8 inches to the right of the line).  There are no trails or other practical ways to get there.

So-pointers and advice please!  

-General safety tips
-Tips on riding on narrow roads with traffic
-How to seek out the best routes (I've scoured the Internet but maybe there's something I missed?)
-Tips on riding in the rain 
-Good tips/links on how to easily change the tire on a mountain bike with multiple gears?
-How afraid should I really be? (I'm *really* freaking scared)


I don't have funds to buy a bunch of equipment.  Right now I have the bike (a mountain bike), a helmet, and a lock-all of which I am borrowing from my GF.  I plan on getting a portable pump, replacement inner tube, a small wrench for tire changes, and patch kit for the road in case I need to do repairs, plus maybe carrying a very small medical kit.  I already have tire levers.

Also, I plan on doing a practice ride to estimate time and try to pick out the best (and least dangerous/scary) route.

Both of them said that, they could not do that, but that they could install my chain for 12-18 dollars.

I understand that these bike places have to try and make a profit, however something like lending me a chain tool, seems like a pretty good way to ensure that if I ever had a real problem with my bike, they would be the first place I came to give my money to.

Being a college student I have very little money to spend on a bike. I can do $250, MAYBE $300 if I can save up more. I've been looking at some Schwinn's that are available through local retailers, such as target and sports authority, but I have seen some websites that tell you to steer clear of Schwinn's. Should I actually try to find something else, or is a Schwinn fine for me because I'm not looking to log 20 miles a day or race?

And before anyone says it, I'd rather not buy a used bike from Craigslist or anything like that. I wouldn't know what to look for, and if it ends up being bad/needing repairs, I wouldn't have the money to do it. 

Thanks!

UPDATE: Thank you guys so much for all of your reply's. You all had some very good points, both for getting a Schwinn and against. Since I have a little bit of time before I need to buy a bike, I'm going to take my time a research various bikes.

* ~34"" leg length
* **Riding preference**: Something to aid in getting around town and campus, with flexibility for longer rides and trails.

I'm going to the University of Delaware, and they have a really fantastic non-profit called the [Newark Bike Project](http://newarkbikeproject.org/).  They have tons of cheap used bikes and many spare parts and friendly people.  I'll be here a while, so I want to get a dependable workhorse that will serve me well in the long haul.  Since I have access to lots of replacement parts and people with the skills to make it work, I'm trying to focus on a good frame and go from there. The bikes they have for sale are in various states of service (some good, some awful).  

I'm limited to what's available, but I think a Hybrid is the right choice for me. Could I also get a mountain bike frame and swap out parts?  NBP has a ton of spare everythings laying around, so I think it could be a good compromise. 
 

**I was looking at:**

* Trek Single Track 950 - $60? (I forget) Needs work -- new tires, chain, and sprockets.
* Trek Mountain Track 830 - $100.  Great condition, would probably need to swap handlebars
* Nishiki backroads series 500 4130 - $70. I know nothing about this brand.

They also had a Peugeot, a Cannondale, some Diamondbacks, and several Department store bikes.  I've read enough to stay away from Schwinn, Huffy, Magna, etc., but are there any other's I should avoid?  Maybe the Peugeot for a lack of easily available spare parts?

**Questions**

* Decent bikes to start with: Trek, Cannondale, Gary Fisher, Iron Horse, Specialized, GT, Kona, Giant.  Any others?  Any you disagree with?
* What's structurally important and what's cosmetic when vetting bikes?  For instance, some were a little rusted.  Does this matter so much? Nothing looked bent or damaged.
* Wheel sizes?  Does this really matter for me at this point?
* I'll be biking with a loaded LLBean backpack most of the time. What handlebars should I be looking into?  I see a lot of recommendations for dropbars, but I'm wondering how that will work with school books over my head.
* How much should I expect to spend?  I feel very fortunate to have the co-op and feel like I could get a lot out of it.  If I spend $100 on a bike, and budget another ~$50 for parts (used co-op parts), is that a reasonable expectation to get something pretty decent going?  I've looked on craigslist, but there doesn't seem to be a lot in this area, unfortunately.  I would like to try and keep things below $200, but I'm not sure if that's reasonable/unrealistic. Thoughts?

I wouldn't mind spending a decent amount on a new wheelset, but I don't know what changes on a wheel as you go up in price and just worry that what I ride in would negate any difference spending more gets me.

The representative at Performance Bikes was saying that, as a very basic replacement, I could get their Titan wheelset, which is around $100 per wheel, but was recommending getting some sort of Eastons (can't remember which, EA90SL maybe) if I really wanted some good ones.

I've done a lot of riding on it lately and am enjoying it, but after a 40+ mile bike(generally to downtown and down the lake front and back) ride my legs(mostly thighs) will just burn like crazy by the time I get home. I tried out my friends road bike which weighs next to nothing compared to this beast and riding it (especially speeding up) was such a blast compared to my bike. 

Perhaps this is just a case of bike envy or something but should I look into ditching my retro bike and look into getting something a tad more modern or should I try just sticking with this thing since it's free. Or maybe even upgrading things on my bike like removing the back rack, changing out the steel rims for lighter aluminum and getting better road tires? From my understanding the bike I currently have is fairly rare especially being red(one of the rarer colors for the 74 sprinter) and I've seen listings for it on ebay in the 500-750 range. Perhaps selling my bike and getting something better is in order? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Otherwise, this will be used fairly casually, not mountain biking or anything particular stressful.

The price is.. I am not sure. Not knowing what I should aim for I can't really budget this very well. Let me put it this way: if people point me at a $100 bicycle and say that it'll be very nice for the number of years it'll be used for, great. 

If it must be $200, so be it. If $150 are nice but $200 are a way better bicycle, I'll spend that. I'm not made of money though, so I won't spend $500 on a child's bicycle.

I expect her to grow quite a bit over the next few years. Tall parents, tall sister and she's gearing up for growth as well so if there are important considerations to look out for, please let me know.

Used bicycle is out of the question because I don't know enough about them and don't want to deal with problems right away; this is a birthday present for her, it needs to be new.

It'd be good if I could purchase this in a physical store in PA, USA.

Over the past year I've started to get into road riding - 60km-100km weekend rides, initially as training for a 200km ride.  I've kind of caught the bug - my regular commuter is ok, but I feel like I'm riding a ford when everyone else is out driving a ferarri.

So - a recent ad for a 2011 Bianchi Sempre caught my eye - $2200 (Australian dollars).  The bike looks in good condition, and about 6 months worth of use.  However, over at Wiggle, they've got a special on the same bike for $1650 or so, plus delivery.  I was thinking of offering $1600 to the seller of the original bike but would like some opinions taking the following into account:

- The $2200 bike is exactly the right size for me.  The Wiggle bikes are 57cm frames, whereas I would normally get a 55cm frame.  Would the extra 2cm rule the Wiggle option out for me, or could it easily be compensated for with seat post/stem adjustment?

- The $2200 bike looks like its had the groupset upgraded to Campy Record (as opposed to the standard Bianchi setup with Veloce).  The Wiggle one uses the Shimano 105 groupset.  Not a $600 difference, I guess, but I'm presuming the Record groupset is a better standard

- The $2200 bike's had the wheelset upgraded to Fulcrum Racing 1.  This might justify the $600 difference, especially in combination with the groupset upgrade.

Should I snap up the Wiggle bike?  Would I be offensively rude/ignorant to approach the other advertiser with an offer of $1600?  I should have noted the $2200 is the initial bid price - 'buy it now' is listed as $2600.

Tire thoughts?,10,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/16th4j/my_poor_bikes_back_tire_is_in_the_arms_of_the/,"So yesterday, a song in my heart and the sun shining, I went to go for a ride and discovered my tube valve was snapped off.  Upon removing the tire to inspect it before replacing the tube, I discovered....well, it's dead.  The wire bead was visible in several places, the reflective sidewall tape was coming off, and bits of sidewall were flaking off.  It's time to send them off to the big pile of old tires in the sky.

Now, don't blame the tires - I've had the bike three years and ridden it over every pothole in the city of Austin.  It's carried bags of charcoal, cases of beer, and whole a couple people (including my neighbor's kids to school once).  It's run over glass, nails, and even gone off road more than once.

The bike is a Surly Long Haul Trucker, and this is the sort of usage I expect my new tires to handle.  They need to be tough as nails, longwearing, puncture resistant, be okay with gravel or packed dirt as well as pavement.  The tires I'm replacing are a pair of Continental Contacts, size 26x1.25 (I really like the size).  

I've looked at simply getting another set of Contis, but I've also looked at the Schwalbe marathon.  But from what I hear, they're gnarly to put on and take off, and heavy as hell.  My LHT doesn't need any help on the ""heavy"" front, but the tires do need to be able to handle the kind of abuse I'm dishing out.  I'm okay with any size from 26x1.25 - 1.75, but I'd like to stay under 2 inches wide.  

I did recently buy my sister a set of Specialized city tires for Christmas, which she loves.  So I just want to make sure I'm not restricting myself or ignoring a good tire because it's not made by Continental or Schwalbe.

I am developing a keen interest in MTB and I want to take my hobby further by riding on more difficult trails.

However, I was discussing trails with a work colleague who said that my current bike would break in half if I rode it on any muddy trail (although I deffo believe this is a bit extreme and there is a tad of elitist about his person).

So let me get to the main points:

1) I own a Carrera Subway 1 (a 2008/9 model) and its listed as a hybrid bike. It seems pretty robust and I've spent some time and money on it, believing that it would be good to use on beginner/intermediate trails without any issue. However this persons comments and a lack of knowledge has knocked my belief that its ok for this use. 

I can post full specs if required.

2) If its a bad idea to put my faith in this bike, then what would be a good starting point? I've been looking at the Felt Q720 and was wondering if this would be any good? If not, on a budget of £600ish (lower is better) what can I get that will last me a few years.

I'm asking because I was about to spend £100 on the crank and bb so I don't want to make ill informed choices with my limited budget.

tl;dr - colleague laughed at bike, got upset, seek advice.

 * is durable 

 * accepts fenders and racks

 * Outfitted with Shimano Tiagra or better

 * Costs no more than around $1300

I have settled on these three bikes. The Bosanova gets points for the disc brakes. Surly loses points for the bar-end shifters (I would upgrade to STI). Kona Jake seems like a great bike, but I think I would prefer steel for a smoother ride and because I am not especially concerned about weight.

Do any of you have any thoughts on these bikes (or any others I should be aware of)? Somebody told me to look at a Novara Verita. I also found a closeout Focus Mares at one of my LBSs--not exactly what I am looking for but deeply discounted.

**EDIT: Bought the Jamis Bosanova. I am over the moon in love with it. Just took it out for a quick 4.5 mile ride during my lunch break. It is a sweet bike.**

I think I might have made a mistake buying the hybrid though. I don't know if I can race with the hybrid without being made fun of by the other cyclists who have the nice road bikes.

My Allez Sport was stolen a little while ago, and I've really been missing my bike. I've got an idea of what I want, but I'm a bit lost. 

I'd consider myself a serious hobbyist, but I have no real desire to do any racing. Maybe an amateur crit at some point, but I doubt it. Focus is fitness and recreation, but I may commute on it some. 

I've only ridden aluminum and steel at this point and pretty much only $1000-range Cannondale and Specialized road and a bianchi cx bike. But, I'm open to just about anything. 

What I want: 

* Drive train: 

    I want something that's at least 105 on Shimano, but I kind of prefer Sram (Apex or Rival is fine). I really hate the way lower-end shimano works...I got my Tiagra/Sora mix transmission stuck god knows how many times because no one could ever get the front adjusted correctly...and I wound up in the big ring for days at a time before I got that terrible sora shifter to let go. Took it to 3 or 4 shops and fiddled myself and never got it sorted, including a cable replacement. So, I'm really hesitant to do shimano at all. No real love for Campy, but I've never ridden it for very long. And I don't want to have to change batteries, not that I want to afford DI2 anyway. 

* Frame: 

    I kind of like more classic lines than, say, an Allez. But I'm not completely married to it. I'd like to be able to carry the bike with either the top tube or the saddle over my shoulder, though. 

    I don't mind aluminum. I don't want to wast energy, but there's no need for an all-out race frame. There's also no-need for super-light. So, there's no real preference on materials, but I do ride in a city (Atlanta). I don't want something so fragile I can't hop those big metal slabs, bad speed bumps, or pot holes. I'm kind of afraid of CF as a result. 

* Ride: 

    Really, what I want is something that turns and descends well but isn't quite as twitchy as my Allez was. Comfort obviously matters, but Aluminum doesn't bother me as long as I've got a nice, firm saddle...which I know I'll have to buy separate. 

* Bars: 

    It's probably too much to ask for, but I'd love not to have to buy classic drop bars the instant I get it. I ***hate*** ergo bars, especially the ones on my Allez. But I will if I have to, since I appear to be in the minority. 

* Looks: 

    No stupid colors. Celeste would be fine, but nothing crazy...I'm not a good enough rider to get away with an intentionally ugly bike. 

Any suggestions? 

Update: 

I went to an LBS for lunch and rode a couple cannondales (caad 10 105, synape alu 105), a trek (domane Ultegra), and a scott (CR1 Team, 105). The Scott seems to have won out of them, but the caad 10 was close. I hit some dirt in a corner and almost bailed on the synapse...kept it up, but it just didn't respond fast enough. Could have been the crappy stock tires, but it still didn't feel right. Domane might have bene *too* comfortable. The CR1 seemed like a good middle ground, but $2100 seems like it might be a lot for a 105 bike, even if the frame feels great. 

After riding several, I'm pretty sold on carbon...everyone seems to think it's fine to jump bumps &amp; plates, and what I did didn't seem to do anything (I try to be kind of rough on bikes on test rides). 

I'm also even more sketched by Shimano. All the way up to Ultegra, they still feel mushy and just kind of wrong. I didn't ride a sram bike today because they didn't have one in my price range, but I'm going to. I remember everything feeling a lot more solid and precise. I know it's all setup dependent, but they just didn't feel that much more right for the money. 

I guess what I'm looking for is aggressive but not too twitchy and Sram Force or Rival (or a mix). And I need to check on my insurance, but if it would cover crashes that break the frame, I'm sold on carbon. 


Update 2: 

I've decided that Sram is worth more than Carbon to me. I was comfortable on Alu before, and I'll be comfortable on it again. I've also kind of decided that I don't like the relaxed geometry bikes as much. The CR1 was impressive, but I rode it right after a much more relaxed bike. And, I feel like they work better for quick test rides without all my gear, but without being able to go on a nice, long high-speed test ride...that's not something I want to change that much. 

Right now, it's the Specialized Comp (Apex) vs. CAAD10 4 (Rival). Specialized is a lot less expensive. I'd love a carbon bike, but it seems like the combination of carbon and sram is hard to come by without spending a lot more money. I could do that, I just don't think it's worth it.

I've been experiencing a strange problem shifting my front derailleur into my large front chain ring. 

I have it adjusted so the derailleur goes out to a proper spot (outer limit) my problem only happens when I'm riding the bike though, when I have it suspended and pedaling with my hands shifting through the gears everything is instant and precise. 

While riding I need to shift into my largest rear cog and slide the lever all the way down (downtube shifter) but the chain won't hop up it just rubs in the middle, to get the chain to move into position I have to stop pedaling then the chain hops onto like 3-4 of the teeth then resume pedaling to complete my shift. 

I believe I've adjusted everything properly, if I were to make my outer limit screws go any farther the chain would fall off and my cable is tight in place, the problem only happens while riding and I do keep the pressure off the pedals while shifting as I've read that's what you should do, I have no clue what I'm suppose to be adjusting or what is wrong.

The componentry on the on the Revenio is sweet at the price but I'm no bike mechanic so I'm not sure I can keep it tuned enough to matter.  I am not a committed cyclist by any means, but I would like to buy something to stick to for the next 10 years that I could potentially do some longer (but definitely non-competitive) rides on.
