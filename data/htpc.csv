1345581041.0,51,self.htpc,ylkel,"[How-to] By request, my fully automated home theater system powered by Android and NFC!",57,6,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/ylkel/howto_by_request_my_fully_automated_home_theater/,"In my last thread about the PS3 controller dock, I had also mentioned my use of NFC to automate my home theater. This got a lot of interest and I was encouraged by several people via PM and comments to make a thread detailing exactly this. Sorry ahead of time if this is a bit long-winded...

.

As many of you know, NFC is a very powerful tool. NFC stands for Near Field Communication which describes the technology very well: you need to be very *near* the receiver/transmitter--almost touching for most low-powered devices. Many new Android devices take advantage of NFC, most notably the Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus, though even newer phones like the SGS3 have the capability too. The current buzzword surrounding NFC is Google Wallet. This is a service that ties into your credit and debit cards as well as rewards and prepaid cards. Together with NFC, it allows you to use your phone like a credit card anywhere NFC payment systems are in place.

.


However, thanks to apps like [NFC Task Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jwsoft.nfcactionlauncher&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5qd3NvZnQubmZjYWN0aW9ubGF1bmNoZXIiXQ..) and NFC stickers from [TagStand](http://www.tagstand.com/) or [TagsForDroid](http://tagsfordroid.com/tags/Home.html) (some of the more popular shops), you now have the power to implement and control NFC anywhere you see fit. I use NFC stickers for a variety of uses from a car dock to setting alarms when I go to bed. However, what a lot of people were wanting to know more about was how I set up my home theater to be fully automated through NFC.

.

___________________________________________

.

Essentially, I have an NFC sticker on the exterior of my front door. When scanned by my GNex, it turns on my LCD TV and tunes Windows Media Center to my favorite channel (which is based on the day of the week and time of day). It will also load a universal remote on my phone to control everything. This process happens so quickly that by the time I walk through the door, I can hear the show on the TV. In reverse, I also have an NFC sticker on the interior of my front door that when scanned, will make sure everything is shut down if it isn't already. This exact functionality is mirrored in the bedroom to turn on that television. However, since I use an Xbox 360 as an extender, I do not have it tune to my favorite channel and it takes a minute or so for TV to start playing.

.

To do this, I required several tools:

* Home Theater PC (or regular PC)
* Android device with NFC (Galaxy Nexus)
* [EventGhost](http://www.eventghost.org/) application running on HTPC
* [Tasker Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm5ldC5kaW5nbGlzY2guYW5kcm9pZC50YXNrZXJtIl0.)
* [Terremote Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eventghostremote.christophergertz.de&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImV2ZW50Z2hvc3RyZW1vdGUuY2hyaXN0b3BoZXJnZXJ0ei5kZSJd) (Remote Control)
* NFC Stickers (Mine are from TagStand)
* [NFC Task Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jwsoft.nfcactionlauncher&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5qd3NvZnQubmZjYWN0aW9ubGF1bmNoZXIiXQ..)
* [USB-UIRT](http://www.usbuirt.com/) IR Receiver/Transmitter (For controlling TVs and external equipment)

.

**PC SETUP**

.

The first step is to prepare the PC you will be using to control the actual home theater components. I use a dedicated HTPC running Windows Media Center. However, the actual controller of this operation will be an application called [**EventGhost**](http://www.eventghost.org/) that runs in the background. You can think of EventGhost as the Tasker for PCs... because, well, it is exactly that. It allows you to perform tasks, macros, or other events based on incoming events. And like Tasker, there are several plugins you can enable to expand functionality. For instance, there is a plugin specific to Onkyo receivers connected through a serial port. I won't get into how you set up EventGhost in here, though if you have a few questions, I may be able to answer them. Once installed, you will need to enable the **Network Event Receiver** plugin. This is what will allow you to receive commands from your the Terremote remote app. Make note of the port and password on this page. Additionally, you will want to enable the **Webserver** plugin. This will allow Tasker to send events through HTTP to your PC. Again, the port and password will need to be noted and you will also need to create a user name.

.

**ANDROID REMOTE SETUP**

.

Once we have this basic setup in place, we can work on the Android side of things. Download and install [Terremote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eventghostremote.christophergertz.de&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImV2ZW50Z2hvc3RyZW1vdGUuY2hyaXN0b3BoZXJnZXJ0ei5kZSJd) on your Android device. To set up the server, go to the menu and select Options. Select New Server, give it a name, and use the local IP address of the PC running EventGhost. The port and password are the same as what's displayed in the Network Event Receiver plugin. Hit save and you will be ready to test out a remote button. Go back to the app and hit menu, Edit Mode. Hit menu again and this time select Add Button. Once you position it to where you want, its property box will open. Mess with whatever you want but the key is in the **Action on click** section. Make sure the type is Network Event and then give it an event name. This name will be what's displayed in the EventGhost log and will be the unique identifier for that button. For instance, a power button could have the event name of: **android.power**

.

Save this button, hit menu and leave edit mode. Make sure you are connected to your local wireless network and tap the new button. You should see the event pop up in the log on the left side of EventGhost. We will use these events to set up tasks to control our devices and programs. I won't get into setting up tasks in EventGhost, but if you want to control things through IR, you will need a compatible IR transmitter. I use [USB-UIRT](http://www.usbuirt.com/) as it seems to be the best and most supported. Once you have added the button event to a task, you are now able to test it through the terremote app and make sure it does what you want. For instance, a power button should send an IR command to your LCD to turn it on and off.

.

**TASKER SETUP**

.

The next thing to do is set up [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm5ldC5kaW5nbGlzY2guYW5kcm9pZC50YXNrZXJtIl0.). Tasker is the handshake between receiving the NFC signal and action through the PC. Open up Tasker and switch to the **Tasks** tab at the top (default view is Profiles). Add a new task, give it a name, and add an action. Select **Net** and then select **HTTP Get**. This will have Tasker send a Get command over HTTP through your network. This will in turn be received by the Webserver plugin in EventGhost.

.

The only settings you need to worry about for the HTTP Get is **Server:Port** and **Path**. Here is an example of what it should look like: [HTTP Get Settings](http://i.imgur.com/R6ROJ.jpg). The Server:Port box MUST adhere to this naming convention:

    user:password@IPaddress:port

Obviously, replace user, password, IPaddress, and port with the actual information from the plugin settings. Again, the IP address is the local IP of the PC running EventGhost. The Path can be anything you want it to be and is the name that will display in EventGhost's log, the only requirement is it needs to be preceded by a question mark. Just make it unique. Save these settings and add a new action. This time select App and then Load App. It will show a list of all installed apps--simply select Terremote. You can keep these settings the same. Save this action and then save the task. You may test this task and it should send an event to the EventGhost log and open Terremote. Add the event to a macro in EventGhost to turn on your TV and you are ready for the next step!

.

**NFC SETUP**

.

You're now ready for the fun part, NFC! Purchase an NFC sticker from your preferred vendor. Again, I have had great luck with TagStand. Install the app [NFC Task Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jwsoft.nfcactionlauncher&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5qd3NvZnQubmZjYWN0aW9ubGF1bmNoZXIiXQ..). Open it and select **New Tag**. Select **New Task** and then **Add Action**. At the bottom of the list is the category Tasker. Select this and then select **Tasker Task**. This will open a window with your available Tasker tasks. Choose the one we just created and hit OK. At the top, select **Done** and then tap your phone to the NFC sticker until it alerts you that it wrote successfully. You can now test this by tapping your phone to the same tag which should now launch the associated NFC Task Launcher command. If all things are set up correctly, Tasker should send a command to EventGhost to turn on your TV and load Terremote on your device.

.

_________________________

.

This is the basic setup for turning your Android device into a full-fledged NFC home automator. Experimenting with what you can control in EventGhost and Tasker, you can do very complex things. For instance, not only do I have mine turn on the TV, but I have it tune into my favorite channel. This *favorite* channel is dependent on the day of the week and the time of the day.

.

A few people have asked why I don't just have this set based on location in Tasker. The reason I use NFC instead is so that I still have to manually initiate the action. Not every time I get home do I want the TV on. This way it only turns on when I actually want to watch something.

.

1362498901.0,36,self.htpc,19pm5q,unRAID 20TB NAS for XBMC and Plex,42,6,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/19pm5q/unraid_20tb_nas_for_xbmc_and_plex/,"[This is my newly upgraded unRAID NAS!](http://i.imgur.com/5zMkjlih.jpg)

I'm posting an update to [my unRAID server build](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/o0iht/unraid_12tb_file_server_build/). I made my initial build in 2010. The reasons for upgrading were to add hot swap cages (also increasing max drives from 12 to 15), get a motherboard with IPMI for headless operation (can't live without it now) and get more CPU for Plex Media Server. My old build was based around a dual core Atom which was fine for the time. I was only serving files and the Atom board provided low energy consumption. My server is mainly used to serve up movies/TV media to XBMC clients on my internal network and now using Plex across the internet. I also use the storage to store a lot of backups.

I decided to go with the Intel Xeon E3-1230v2 since it the cheapest single node Xeon CPU with hyper-threading. I know that I could probably get away with just an i3 but I wanted the flexibility of transcoding to multiple Plex clients and well as the option to move to ESXi in the future. The idle power consumption is still very good on this CPU and it's worth the extra $100 to know that the CPU won't choke during transcoding.

Having gone from a 3Mbps DSL connection to a 150Mbps FIOS connection, I realize that my Atom CPU couldn't keep up with DLing and decoding files in Sabnzbd. I would only get 7MB/s in SAB with the dual core Atom and now I can max out the FIOS connection at around 19MB/s :) I also decided I wanted to install Plex Media Server on my unRAID server. I also took the opportunity to upgrade from unRAID 4.7 to 5rc11. This was necessary for 3TB support and Plex support.

The build price below is without the hard drives included. Prices of the hard drives has vary as I've purchased them over the past few years. I've taken all the 1TB and 500GB drives out of the array. It is now made up of:

* 7 x 2TB and 2 x 3TB Data Drives
* 1x 3TB Parity Drive
* 1x 3TB Warm Spare
* 1x 500GB Cache Drive

20TB of total data storage with another 3TB waiting as a warm spare for a failed drive or additional storage if needed.

All the smaller drives are being moved over to my new backup server. I was able to pickup a Rosewill Challenger case for $39 and a Corsair CX430 for $16 to make the cheap second server. The Supermicro AOC-SASLP-MV8 is going to replaced later this week with an IBM Serveraid M1015 flash to IT mode. This new SAS card has about 4x the total throughput. My current AOC-SASLP-MV8 will be totally saturated when I have 8 drives on the controller. The M1015 will be nice if I make the decision to move to ESXi and virtualize my unRAID setup in the future.

1365803859.0,28,self.htpc,1c8g80,Did a clean sheet HTPC build to replace my 4~ year old machine. Here are some build notes and software tips.,31,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1c8g80/did_a_clean_sheet_htpc_build_to_replace_my_4_year/,"First a little background:
My first ""HTPC"" was an original XBOX running XBMC, this was a great cheap solution that worked awesomely for standard def content. I used it from about 2003 until somewhere around 2007 when I got my first HDTV.
My second HTPC was a purpose built computer based on an AMD mini-atx mobo in an Antec Fusion case. For storage I had 2 750GB drives in striped with a single 80GB drive for OS. I tried a number of different DVR software packages and after a few months running BeyondTV on XP64, I moved to windows vista running WMC; similarly I tried various different OTA and clearQAM tuners and ended up with an original HDHomerun box which had decent performance and had the advantage of being network attached allowing me to put it in the room with the best access to cable and antenna feeds. Vista with WMC was rad with a few notable exceptions, channel mappings had to be done by hand, video and audio drivers were frequently messing with the onboard video's ability to provide deinterlacing and accelerated decoding as well as stable multichannel spdif output.
I eventually updated to windows 7 and a ceton inifinitv cablecard tuner, and at the same time I dropped some change on a new Onkyo receiver. This drove the need to upgrade to a pci-e ATI video card with decent hdmi audio bit streaming support. This worked decently for years albeit with a bit more fan and drive noise than I liked and so mysteriously unsolvable bitstreaming audio issues that seemed to randomly work with DD+ and DTS but not TrueHD.

So, that brings me to the current build.

* [Pulse-Eight usb-hdmi-cec adaptor](http://www.pulse-eight.com/store/products/104-usb-hdmi-cec-adapter.aspx)

Build Notes:

* I had misread the specs on the case and thought it would fit 2x3.5"" drives and a 2.5"" drive, in reality it probably could fit those, but the placement of the standoffs and through holes won't allow it.
* The case could probably accommodate 5x2.5"" and is setup with standoffs and through holes for 3x2.5""
* The heatpipe assembly to connect the case's side panel to the cpu was a little fidgety to get together and required a bit more force than I would have liked. That said, with out any CPU fan and with an SSD the machine makes no noise. There might be a very slight AC whine from the external AC/DC PSU for the DC/DC pico PSU, but it is below the db floor that would be noticeable unless you only watch silent movies.
* The case doesn't come with the flexible pci-e riser which is needed to mount any accessory cards, I didn't realize this when I bought the case. Luckily a 7 dollar cheapy pci-e 1x riser from amzon works as expected.
* The full length ceton tuner card fits fine in the case, but overheats within a few minutes w/o any fan move air from between the double layer design card. The newer single layer card may not experience this problem.
* I had seen pictures of a 120mm fan mounted in the bottom, rear, left most corner of the case to provide airflow for expansion cards. In reality I couldn't fit a Noctua 120mm fan in that spot as it was too narrow and the 3.5"" drive location wouldn't allow the sata cable enough room without having some very very low profile right angle connectors. I had no such thing, so.....
* The stock fan from the APU heatsink does fit under the expansion card once I redrilled the 3.5"" mounts to move the drive forward in the case. IMHO the revised location should be where it is from the factory and would allow for a second 3.5 drive to fit more rearward in the case that you don't need a fan.
* The stock fan from the APU is virtually silent when run at 850RPM, a feat easily achievable with the ASUS board's high end fan controller. A lucky coincidence that the board has that feature since I didn't even plan for a single fan when I purchased it.
* The slimline bluray drive with mounting try just BARELY clears the picoPSU and makes a serious racket when reading data disks. However when playing a bluray movie the drive makes no noticeable noise at normal listening volumes; except for some spin seek noise when restarting after a long pause (bathroom break).
* With the ASUS board and the provided USB 3 internal cable it is not possible to connect the front panel usb3 port AND have the slimline drive since the cord and mount both want to occupy the same space.
* The HDMI detective was bought on a whim since I sometimes have problems with the PC changing video settings depending whether the AVR or TV powers on first and which device completes HDMI handshake. The box is brilliant! Setup was simple and my AVR and HTPC stay sync'd without audio hiccups after pausing as well as having solved the handhake/settings interaction. This may be achievable through clever software config, but the box was just way simpler.
* The HDMI-CEC adaptor is similarly brilliant, allowing me to control WMC7 using my TV remote's media buttons without having to sort an IR receiver repeater arrangement. A great feature (the slimline PS3 also does this) to have. Also if it allows me to select my playback device from the TV and it will automatically switch my AVR input to the correct one as well as launch WMC7 if it isn't running.

Software Notes:

* Since the last time I did a bare install support for bitstreaming audio has gotten way way way simpler. Installing LAV filters and running a small registry modification is all it takes to be able to get mkv splitting for all my ripped HD-DVD movies (I forgot to mention my old HTPC had a HD-DVD/BluRay combo drive :) ) and i get dd+, TrueHD, and DTS-HD without problem.
* Since the last time I did blah blah blah, ripping HD-DVD movies got way easier too! Since the new machine doesn't have an HD-DVD drive I was able to rip them with [MakeMKV](http://www.makemkv.com/) with only a few clicks. There were only 3 discs out of 40+ that refused to play along.
* LAV filter also handles doing video decoding using the ATI GPU's DXVA2 and apparently also works with nvidia's solution as well (I've not tried nvidia though).
* When moving the Ceton card with cablecard between PCs there is no need to reactivate/pair the cable card. However all my recordings from premium channels on my old PC were flagged with copy-once drm and cannot be view on the machine. Recordings that weren't marked copy-once can be imported by browsing to them in the new WMC7 instance and selecting ""copy"" from the action menu. Sometime I had to attempt the copy more than once since the DRM operation is apparently finicky.
* If you have Haali splitter or ffd show installed on windows 7, WMC7 will prefer them over LAC which can cause some headaches to figure out. IMHO if you are going over HDMI to a good AVR you're best off to install only LAV and no other codec packs or splitters.
* Arcsoft Total Media Theater is still really awesome for playing back blurays, but it's WMC7 integration causes WMC to crash every time. I /think/ using something like anyDVD+ along with LAV /may/ allow for native playback of Bluray in WMC, but I don't think you'll be able to access the menus, only watch the main feature with the prefered audio track.
* [Ceton's mediacenter companion app](http://cetoncorp.com/products/companion/) for IOS is super duper cool, and lets you do all sorts of neat shit. Worth the few bucks it costs, just for it's guide browser and TV Premieres views alone.


At any rate, I hope that was useful for someone. The short of it is that for not much money you can have a VERY nice windows 7 based HTPC/DVR. If I was doing it over again I might opt for the HD10 case and run 2 data drives, that said, 2TB 2.5"" drives have to be coming soon and this case could hold plenty of those.

I took advantage of a few of the Newegg President's Day sales, so don't be offended if I skipped some of your suggestions.

Here is the link to the original thread http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/18bklt/steamboxhtpc/, and here is what I ended up with. http://pcpartpicker.com/p/DgUw

It is running Windows 8 with WMC and controller by my harmony remote via IR Receiver. Tuner is the HDHomeRun, which is a magical device. I'm running an XBOX360 as my extender for the bedroom TV and my Gaming PC in my office runs that TV/monitor.

I played Skyrim on Ultra High and it worked great using the XBOX 360 Wireless receiver for controller support. 

I use HippoRemote for any quick mouse/keyboard actions and I have a Microsoft Arc Mouse and Keyboard for hardcore mousing.

Noise was a big concern for me, so I swapped in some of my low RPM fans and it has been great. Not sure this is a universal gauge, but my PS3 is completely silent and the HTPC is just slightly more audible than that. The temps are really low due to the 120mm fans all around and the video card has never really ramped up on me to where I noticed it being very loud.

Here is the album, I got tired of taking pictures after a while, so there's only a few.

The ultimate goal was to have the computer blend in with its surroundings. It’s not a high-end or expensive PC by any means but it’s plenty for what I use it for. I am running Windows Server 2008 R2 and I run two media servers on it: PlayOn and Twonky Server. I use Twonky for streaming local media and PlayOn for Hulu and other random channels. I used liquid cooling because I wanted to maintain the completely stock look of the case but still have quiet and consistent cooling. I harvested a lot of the parts from a previous HTPC build but originally I spent in between $200-$300. Parts list:


CPU: AMD Athlon X2 255 3.10 GHz
Liquid Cooling: Zalman LQ-310 Water Cooler
Motherboard: MSI 880GM-E43
RAM: 4GB G.SKILL Ripjaws DDR3 1600
PSU: Thermaltake TR2 W0070 430W ATX 12V
Case: JVC Cassette Stereo

I've been back and forth over what OS to run on my new machine and I have to say... I'm liking the idea of windows 8.  A lot of people have been giving the Metro UI shit, but it looks perfect for HTPC usage.  I installed it through Parallels on my Mac over the weekend to have a play around with it and it seems legit. 

I've been deciding between OpenELEC and XBMCBuntu (but eventually decided OpenELEC)... and now I'm torn between that and W8.  On one hand, OpenELEC provides a pure XBMC experience and will be suited mostly towards playing back video content.  But running W8 gives me the option to have a web browser, play some games, and use my machine like a PC if I want to, but still maintain an appliance like functionality through the Metro UI and having XBMC installed etc. I've even seen some people post write ups about having their W8 box boot right into XBMC instead of to Metro.

Any thoughts?  Seems like it's sort of a mixed bag out there in the HTPC crowd right now, you either love it or you hate it.

So what's the deal? What's the advantage of XBMC? Or what's the advantage to WMC?

------

**WRAPUP: It seems like XBMC is great for playing local files and has bundled codec and subtitle support, but may require some tinkering. WMC is best for live TV DVR and Netflix. Plex is the client/server solution for those with multiple machines pulling from one media store.

Once again, there's no clear winner, which is frustrating. HTPC shouldn't be nearly as damned difficult as it is.**

Some things that I learned:

* The Silverstone Grandia GD05B is better than the GD04B (looks the same except front panel is all aluminum) if you aren't planning on having an optical drive.  
* The case is tight, but it gives you enough room on the sides for good cable management.  
* Cooling is great with the case and gives you room to add more fans or a closed liquid system like the H60.  Will take most aftermarket CPU coolers.  
* An SSD is much faster than a HDD, but I wouldn't say that it is worth the extra price right now for a plain old HTPC.  The main difference is the boot and install times, but program loading doesn't seem to be much faster than a 7200rpm drive with readyboost.  Playing media makes absolutely no difference between the two.  
* For the Crucial M4 SSD, using a SATA II or SATA III connection doesn't seem to make a huge difference for writes (M4 advertised max write speed is less than SATAII max writes).  Writes were around the same for both.  
* Storage fills up quickly for a 2TB HDD, especially if you are doing your own encoding.

I was looking at new Android phones when I stumbled across this Android thumb drive. I already can stream all my ripped movies to my phone using Twonky as my media server and BubbleUPnP on my phone.  It works great, so I see no reason why this shouldn't work.  And for $45 I think it's worth a try.  

If you dont know what Im talking about, ""Android on a Stick"" is basically an Android tablet without a screen and a HDMI out.  You need to have a wireless keyboard/mouse to run it. 

I currently have a Sony Blu-ray as my endpoint in the living room but the UI sucks...for the wife, she hates it, but she has a Android phone so maybe this will be a little more intuitive.

Anyone else using one of these? It comes tomorrow but Im on a business trip, Ill update with pics and whatnot when I get back if there is any interest.

**UPDATE!!!!**

FYI I have learned the we should refer to the unit as the MK808..even though there are at least 4 different versions of this thing out there. I own an ""Original"" MK808, so if you buy one and things seem a little different that how I describe you my have a different model.  Here is how you ID the version you own https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4FBHwyIbkNebll0ZzJ0NVBPV3M/edit?usp=sharing

Here is the unboxing http://imgur.com/a/l5fzn

The unit is VERY small and very light.  To be honest when I finally held it in my hand I thought I had been scammed because it doesn't seem that something so small could really work well.  It does!

It comes with all the cables you need to hook it up, I had it connected and running in about three minutes. **NOTE:** Out of the box the MK808 is hard set to 1080p, the first TV I connected it to was an old 720p unit and all I got was a black screen. I moved it to my 1080p TV and it worked fine.  You CAN adjust the resolution down to 720p but if you dont have a 1080p TV I have no idea how you are going to do that http://i.imgur.com/bxN76o2.png 

Out of the box I plugged a hard wired mouse in to the unit. that worked without an issue.  After I had configured it I switched to a Logitech MX Air Rechargeable Cordless Mouse http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Air-Rechargeable-Cordless-Mouse/dp/B000T8CWFE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368189225&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=logitech+air+mouse 
There was no configuration, you plug it in and the mouse starts working.  FYI: Right clicking is like pressing the back button, very handy!

It comes with Android 4.1.1 loaded http://i.imgur.com/pQbydfx.png and a ton of Chinese Only apps preinstalled.  To be honest it worried me to have all these apps on it that I have no idea what they do so within 10 mins of playing with it I decided to root it. One of the main reasons why I waned to root is you cant turn the sucker off with the stock image without unplugging it. So I quickly found some simple instructions with a very good ROM for all four different versions of the MK808.  This is where knowing what version of the MK808 is important. Root is super easy because the unit is not locked. Really all you are doing is getting the unit in to Flash Mode so you can flash a new ROM. 

Here is all four ROMs with all the tools you need (This ROM is refered to as Finless) http://www.freaktab.com/showthread.php?3857-NEW-MK808-quot-all-models-quot-Finless-1-7 

And here is a video walking you through flashing the ROM http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n63W2zustS8 

It is really easy to do.  My unit has the hidden button that puts the the unit in to flash mode, it took me longer to figure out I had the button than it did to flash the ROM.

So once I got the new ROM loaded it was MUCH faster and all the little options like a power button and hiding the status bar were all there. I installed BubbleUPnP, connected it to Twonky and the set up of my HTPC was basically complete! I loaded things like Angry Birds and Google Earth to test it out and it runs super smooth.

After a day of playing around with configuring things and installing addons, I'm confused.

First, is there an easier way to install addons? it seems like I have to go down, then up menus so many times just to download and install an addon.

Second, same with browsing media. Down into menus, locations, and then the files and then up to get back.

Third, is there any better, smarter way to get XBMC to pick up all the media? it seems silly to have to add locations, scan them, and then organize my library manually into TV shows, movies, etc. There's got to be a better way?

I hope I'm missing something but if I'm going to hand over the remote to my wife she's not going to want to get into all this. And I just want to sit down, browse my library, and play.

What I discovered is that *some* computers support power on/off commands through USB. This is dependent on the motherboard though, and it was not an option for me. If it were possible, this would have been the easiest solution (USB infrared remote or keyboard).

I searched through a lot of information, including instructables, trying to find a solution. I was willing to build something if necessary, but would rather not spend a lot of time and mental energy frustrating myself. I spent endless hours searching forums.

The two solutions I eventually tried:

[HDPLEX](http://www.hd-plex.com/remote.control.html)
I tried this solution first. TBH, I couldn't figure it out. The components they sent me did not match those in the instruction book. Also, their parts seemed to be designed specifically for their builds/cases. I eventually gave up on this. If someone wants me to send it to them I'd be happy to. It's possible I was not understanding things correctly, but gave up hastily because I found the second option.

[SIMEREC](http://www.simerec.com/PCS-2.html) This worked! The instructions are great, and their customer service was quick and helpful when I had a problem programming it (my fault). They sell one option that lets you use two different buttons, one for on and one for off (what I got). They also have a one-button version, where the one button both powers the computer on and off. The kit was complete and instructions easy to follow. No soldering involved (which SIMEREC necessitated), which was a plus. The system basically interjects itself into the line to the power button on the front of the case, and requires you to splice into a power line from the power supply (see their PDF instructions online). I also had to drill a hole in the front of my case. These were all relatively painless modifications in my mind.

* Hard Drive: Crucial m4 64GB SSD, $72.99

These specs would have been more than enough to accomplish the tasks of playing 1080p videos with XBMC, Usenet/torrents, browsing the internet, and serving media to my Xbox 360 and Nexus 10.

The component that I spent the most time searching for was the case. The smallest case that I could find that could house the parts I wanted while still being attractive was the [E-i5 case](http://www.ecosmartpc.com/ei5.html) with the 84W PSU from ecosmartpc.com ($114.98 shipped).  This would have suited my needs but I’d only rate the design a 7.5/10 and it’s also quite expensive.  I also looked at the [Wesena ITX2-B](http://www.shop.perfecthometheater.com/HTPC-ITX2-v1-Black-Ultra-small-aluminum-chassis-HTPC-ITX2-B.htm;jsessionid=982812B247AED5F811807F17FB2FD139.qscstrfrnt05) ($64), but ruled it out when I read that some users were having heat and ventilation issues. Without the case I was already looking at +$340.

I’ve found that there’s next to no selection when it comes to buying a small, compact HTPC case. Even dialing down the specs of the computer still made it an expensive option. The cases that are out there come at a huge premium compared to the larger Micro ATX cases.  For a second I even considered getting a Mac Mini at $599. Even when you consider that it’s by far the most attractive HTPC from a design standpoint, there’s no way I could justify spending that kind of money if all I’m going to do is watch videos and stream media, no matter how gorgeous it looks. If small and compact were not a requirement, I’d have settled on building my own PC. Which brings me to……..



**The Decision**


I ultimately decided to go with the [Zotac ZBOX nano ID61 Barebone](http://www.amazon.com/Zotac-Dual-Core-Celeron-Barebone-ZBOXNANO-ID61-U/dp/B008OHRFE0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360094341&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=id61) ($191). I added an 8GB stick of RAM and a 64GB SSD, bringing my total to just $320 shipped. 

The first thing to note is that [the ID61 is tiny](http://i.imgur.com/4Qy37Uc.jpg). It looks more like a [small wireless router](http://i.imgur.com/gIM603C.jpg) than an actual desktop computer and this is just what I was looking for. It comes with a 1.3GHz Intel Celeron 867 Dual-Core processor with integrated graphics. The processor is by no means powerful but I soon realized that I didn’t need it to be. The addition of the SSD and 8GB of RAM makes it fly through all HTPC related tasks such as downloading videos, browsing the internet, playing videos, and serving media. It boots to Windows 8 Pro 64-bit in only 9 seconds. After installing Windows and downloading all the required drivers, my first task was to see just how well it could play my videos. Simply put, it plays every video file I own without any problems. I attached my 1TB External USB Drive and shared it across my network and all devices can play files with no issues. Streaming 1080p videos from YouTube works well and Netflix also works effortlessly.

If all you want to do is stream and download videos, play large, high-quality video files,  stream media to network devices, and browse the internet, then the Zotac ZBOX ID61 + 64GB SSD + 8GB RAM combo will do all of that at a price of only ~$320.  If you wanted to save even more money you could go with 2GB of RAM and a 320GB non-SSD hard drive lowering the total price to $265. Zotac sells an ID61 will exactly these specs but it’s $18.99 more expensive at $283.99.





I thought I'd show you that you can get a decent HTPC in a tiny case and spend a lot less than you would custom building a computer.

I'm one of the team behind nuPlay ( https://nuplay.co ) and we're in the midst of playing with prototype hardware and actively developing (and breaking) our software platform. Whilst we think we've included quite a few features that we hope people will like (which you can read about on the site), we'd love to hear your thoughts about what you think we're missing.

From a software perspective, we're an alternative to XBMC - from a hardware perspective, we like to think of ourselves as the demon spawn that could result if the existing options (such as the Roku, WDTV, etc) got freaky and naked one night.

Our hardware platform is running on quad core 1.7GHZ ARM architecture with 2GB of RAM - and has no issues with 1080p video playback or emulation of older consoles (we're tweaking issues with PS1 and N64 emulation) - but... we feel as if we're missing something.

So, what would you love to see in an appliance such as this? Our goal is to create a truly open platform (the software and OS images will be made freely available, we do not restrict you to our hardware), and that can only be done with your help.

",19,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/rjqxb/my_review_and_filthy_gadgetlust_for_the_roku_plex/,"First and foremost, I wrote about [my journey towards freedom from the cord]( http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/ppeie/not_only_did_i_cut_the_cord_but_i_jumped_so_hard/) which has a good amount of detail of how I did it.  [Here's an ""Explain like I'm 5"" version of my set up]( http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/ppeie/not_only_did_i_cut_the_cord_but_i_jumped_so_hard/c3r7c03)

Long story short, I use Plex.  Couldn't be happier.  I used XBMC for a few weeks, and it was fine.  However, when I switched to Plex, purely just to test it, and within 15 minutes I knew I was never going back to XBMC.  I love Plex so much, I am not even interested in looking at screen shots of XBMC EDEN, (the new version that supposed to be King Shit on Turd Island) 

For my main TV watching activities, I use a small form factor HTPC connected directly to my TV.  I run the Plex Media Center app on that PC and it's a job doing muufuuka, muufuuka.  I love it.  

However, I have 3 small sons, and a wife who cares so little about technology, she may as well be Amish.  Don't get me wrong, she LOVES technology, but just as long as I'm the one putting it together, and reading her user manuals for her, and fixing and configuring every OPTIONS tab for her.  Other than that, she's a real tech wiz…

Since we cut the cable cord completely, we needed a way to allow my children to play all their kid shows (SpongeBob, Fairly Odd Parents, iCarly and all the other kids shows that we all know damn well we all watch too, parents or not..)   and my wife to be able to watch her retarded shows (Saved by the Bell, Golden Girls, Cosby Show etc etc etc…ok I actually watch GG.  Screw you if you even consider lying and saying you don't like that show.  Screw you right in your soul.) 

Also, we have a projector and a 100 inch projector screen to watch movies.  
Before I would have to jump through hoops to hook a laptop up to the projector, and then take it all down when done.  I needed a small box that could permanently be hooked up to the projector, had to have a remote, since the shelf is high, and had to be small to fit on top of the projector shelf with it.  

(**BONUS PRO TIP**: The ROKU remote is Bluetooth, meaning the Roku can be behind you (where a projector would be) and you can still aim the remote at the projection screen (which of course, feels more natural) and the Roku reads it just fine.  No IR line of sight required.  PRO TIP LIKE A SUMMBITCH, HUH?)

Luckily, when I ditched XBMC, that opened up the Roku as a possibility.  The Roku really doesn't work with XBMC.  At least I couldn't figure it out.   I got a Roku and first and foremost, noticed how damn snappy and wonderful the Netflix app is.  I had been testing a lot of devices and a whole slew of Netflix apps/channels on each device. Everything from my PS3, to the Netflix app built into Plex and XBMC to the Netflix available directly on my TV to the BlueRay player I was testing to blah blah blah blah.  You get the idea, Netflix apps errrwhere. 

**Let me say this by itself so you may completely understand:  The Netflix channel/app that ships with the Roku, is the best Netflix app/channel I've EVER used.  More so than the actual Netflix Online Streaming website.  It's responsive and borderline fun, by itself. **

The other official and featured channels available for Roku are also pretty good, and the ability to add private channels via the Roku website is a very nice addition.  I enjoy Crackle, but other than that, I ONLY used the Netflix app on my Roku….until…

Until…

I built myself an unRAID server and had 18TB free to use, so I started on my goal of having more options than Netflix.  I wanted my very own LoogieFlix, and dare I say, I could cancel Netflix and save even more money!

With my newfound love of Plex, on top of my new unRAID server itching to be filled like a prom date, I decided to test out the Plex channel on Roku.

Having tested the PlayOn channel on the Roku I was not expecting anything good.  

(In fact, the PlayOn channel is the worst thing I've ever witnessed that is considered to be ""working"".  I've seen some shitty things in my life that are considered ""not working"" or ""broken"" but the PlayOn channel on Roku is 100% functioning, and is shittier than most things considered ""broken"".  It's awful. ) 

 Bear in mind, the Plex channel was in beta, and I don't think it was even officially made by Plex.  I know for certain it wasn't supported by Plex at this time

I installed the Plex channel and was pleasantly surprised.   It instantly found my Plex Media Server and connected without a single issue. I had about 50 movies at this point, and all the Plex channel menus loaded quite fast.  

It was very stable, very functional, and very good looking, but it wasn't snappy.  It was nothing like the Netflix app.  It was slow and unresponsive, but it worked and was damn good looking. 

The fewer movies in the section, the faster and better the app was.  But as my movie section grew over 100, then 200, then 300 movies, it became unusable. 

After some research, I found a private channel (user made) called PlexGrid.  Since then, I have been that channels biggest fan.  It uses a different way to display the movies, therefore it could load all 300 (and eventually 550) of my movies in less than 3 seconds.  It was every bit as snappy as the Netflix app

The BONUS was the Roku + Plex is so easy to use my 3 year old hits the Home button, scrolls over to Plex Grid, launches PlexGrid, then hits ""Kids Movies"" or ""Kids Shows"" then scrolls over to whatever he wants to watch and launches it, like a boss. 

**tl;dr The Roku is awesome. It's not as powerful as other options, but with the right 3rd party servers, it's almost guaranteed to be the best (and easiest to use) at whatever you want to do**

- Memory: Patriot Viper 3 2x4GB PC1600 ($40 at Newegg)

- PSU: Antec Earthwatts 380w ($31.50 at Newegg)
- Case: Rosewill R101-P-BK ($29.50)

**Total: $306**


**To this I added more computer parts:**

- Samsung 500GB HDD (for DVR drive)
- 2x Samsung 2TB HDD (for media library - mirrored)
- HDHomeRun Dual network TV tuner
- HP MCE remote and USB IR receiver

The PC + other hardware is located in a media closet connected to the rest of the house via extenders over Cat5e (HDMI, IR, USB, ethernet). I also use the HTPC as a Squeezebox server which runs 3 zones for music, controllable over the network via browser or smartphone app.

The final piece of the puzzle is a Logitech Harmony remote to make the system usable by the wife. For LiveTV/DVR I use WMC and for watching the media library, XBMC.

Overall I'm very happy with how it all works. I can play, rip and record full HD video and control everything with a remote control. The system boots straight into WMC so it doesn't look like a windows system to the user. The only things it can't do is play HD 3D video and play modern games but neither was a requirement for me.

Having said that, I wouldn't recommend a someone else to do a similar setup unless they really enjoy figuring our PC issues, troubleshooting and spending time getting everything perfect. The system is easy to use with a properly configured universal remote and any unforeseen issues are correctable with a system reboot.

Behind the scenes it also does a lot more such as automated backup, commercial removal from recorded TV, media server duties for streaming devices elsewhere in the house etc. I'd be happy to answer questions or provide guidance for anyone doing the same.",,False,self,t5_2rbfy,False,,,True,t3_1fhsge,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1fhsge/my_htpc_build_and_review_1_year_on/,

Music playback &amp; serving to laptop (DAAP)  
Torrents (Deluge + FlexGet (haven't tried it yet tho))  
Remotely controllable  


**Questions**  
**1.** Is this CPU capable of playing 1080 over HDMI and have a music player and torrent client open in the background?  
**A Yes!**  
**2.** Is 8Gb RAM overkill?  
**A Yes! 4GB is enough**  
**3.** Is it a stupid idea to use a USB 3.0 thumb drive for OS (Ubuntu) and Software (XBMC, Banshee / Rhythmbox, DAAP server, Torrent client) 32Gb should be plenty and it would be nice to keep a bay free for future HDDs.  
**A 32GB USB drive should be fine**  
**3.1** Can anyone recommend Linux DAAP software? I read Firefly is dead but maybe it still works ok?  
**4.** What's everyone's preferred solution for a remote? I briefly used XBMC web remote on a smartphone and seemed to work OK, but would it be worth spending a bit extra on an IR receiver or one of those CEC HDMI things? This has to be girl-friendly!  
**A Harmony Remote**  
**4.1** Best way to control a large music collection from the couch? I was planning on using an old laptop for this, maybe smart phone again.

I am a longtime HTPC lover, and living overseas in China I rely on VPN/Streamed Internet and torrents.  Such is life when there is no TV content for your family in your native language.  

Long story short I have a WMC HTPC running with Media Browser, it is amazing, love it like a child :)  I started out with smaller drives but have constantly had to upgrade to keep up... I just love to keep stuff in collections.  Right now have a 1TB drive for OS/Apps, 2TB Internal for Movies/Shows/Games, and a 2TB external that I mirror weekly from the Internal as a backup.  

The storage battle is killing me, my drives are full and I hate to delete stuff.  So I want to do something more robust...  I am looking to you guys for options, not really sure what direction to take.  More external drivers?  NAS?  Some soft of storage controller?

Ultimately I would want something that is expandable, has redundancy, and is decently quiet.  I don't mind spending for the right item if it fits my purpose.  I presume something small office level, I don't want to go buy an HP MSA :)

So I haven't really ever built a system this small, or used a PC for home theater use.  I am thinking I will run XBMC.  I will mostly be using it to watch files stored on another PC.  I might do some game emulation or use Steam's Big Picture.

From what I am reading the A10's graphics are about as good as the best combo you can fit in a case this size (ivybridge + half-height HD7750).

* Case- I wanted something small and was originally going to go with a HTPC case that looks like a receiver or something that will fit nicely in my theater cabinet. But since my theater cabinet is not designed as one it has supports on the front preventing any case from fitting inside. I could have went mITX but...o well. The case is nice, but if I build another PC I will definitely spend more on a case. It was very small and it only came with 5 mobo standoffs even though the manual said 7.
* Mobo- Do not know much about mobo's so I went with this one...
* RAM- Not a bad price for some 1866, which according to everyone on here is important because AMD APU's love fast ram..thanks Although my BIOS says its only 1600? I know I can change that right, is that ok to change it, safe?
* SSD-SSD wasn't necessary but I wanted it..and I found a good price
* PSU-Yea, its a PSU...pretty reputable I think.
* I already had an External HD that will store all my media...I might take the enclosure off this thing and install it internally..but I am scared to ruin it. 
* My TV looks good running Windows 7. BTW, I had a copy of windows 7 already.

**Notes &amp; Experience:**

There is no hard drive in the list because I used an spare Seagate 250gb 7200 rpm drive. I am only using this as a media front-end. All media is on file servers. 

Pros:

* System has more than enough power to run XBMCbuntu pushing 1080p bluray rips off my network though HDMI. 
* Xmbc looks fantastic, and I have yet to find a format/codec combination in my library that it can't easily handle. It even plays the movies that my old Netgear EVA8000 broke with non-standard meta info embedding.
* CPU &amp; board run at ~30-40ºC even while pushing 1080p mkv with H.264/AC3 content. I used the stock CPU cooler &amp; no case fans.
* mobo has HDMI out &amp; optical audio out on the back plate. There was also a header for the coax digital audio out. This is needed for me because my receiver was built pre-hdmi.
* CPU is never above 20% utilization.
* P/S is pulling 90-125 watts according to my killawatt, idle to playing videos
* Rosewill Remote worked out of the box without any configuration on my part. 

Cons:

* While HDMI video worked out of the box, configuring XBMCbuntu to output audio from the HDMI was surprisingly difficult, and I needed to use custom entries in the settings, as well as modify my /etc/asound.conf 
* I had to add ""client lanman auth = Yes"" to my /etc/smb.conf on my debian SMB server to allow XBMC to attach to my movie/tv fileshares. The Debian server is running default otherwise. However, XBMCbuntu was able to easily connect to my buffalo linkstation share without modification, so it could just be more strict security settings from the Debian devs.
* Case cannot fit a ATX power supply &amp; optical drive at the same time.
* There is a 5 to 25 second delay when starting movies, but this could be due to using netgear power-line (HDX101) adapters instead of gigE to the switch.
* Nitpick: I wish the case had an IR receiver built into the front bezel. Right now I have the remote's usb receiver plugged into the front usb port. but I'd love to clean that up.

Hopefully this information will help others figure out whats best for them. Also, I'd like to benchmark this setup, does anyone know of any Linux based (or liveUSB) benchmarking software? 
I'm also trying to figure out a way to have the system go into suspend or even turn off when idle, and turn back on when I select the input on my TV. Anyone have any ideas?

I'd prefer to stay under $250, but if you guys really think that's too low for the features I want, then so be it.

**Features it must have:**   

-be able to stream and play medium-high bitrate 1080p video flawlessly.  I have a desktop PC with PS3 media server all set up already.   
-HDMI video out  
-Audio surround output, preferrable optical. HDMI out surround is OK, not preferred.   


**Features I want:**   

-Blu-ray *capable*. Meaning, i may not buy the blu-ray drive *now*, but want to be able to add it later if not now.   
-compact. ideally about the size of a ps3, or a really thick blu-ray player. 
-quiet and efficient.    
-a nice stylish case that looks like a media player, meant to sit on its side rather than up like a tower.
-somewhat future-proofed. At least in the realm of 1080p video.

Problem with that one though, is the case. It's too big and looks too much like a desktop. I should also mention that I have a 160GB 2.5"" 5400RPM HDD that I can use for this guy, so if you guys feel that it should suffice for this build then I won't buy a new HDD for now. I'm really trying to keep this cheap.

So what about other options? The Raspberry Pi looks great, but I question it's 1080p streaming abilities. And I doubt one could hook up a blu-ray player to it... but again, thats not 100% needed for this build.

**What I have**

Currently i have a media pc connected to my living room tv via hdmi.
I've xbmc installed on it.
I like the layout and look and feel of XBMC.

I've an android phone that can act as the remote when on the same network.
 
When Im using the phone as a remote it can be a bit laggy I,e a press left nothing happens press it again still nothing – then it moves excess places. 

And I have a similar lag if I use Ubuntus remote viewers as a remote instead of the phone.

Overall tho I like it 


I briefly was also able to stream video from the HTPC to my android phone via upnp app (I think) but it was clunky an awkward to use.
 

**What Id like**

What i like to move to is central storage for media files. And have them accessible inside and outside of my house/network.
 
Id also like smaller computers connected to a tv in each room. I want these to be able to access the central storage and display films etc on the tv. I want to be able to control all of this by either a phone, ipad , or other android tablet or computer 
 
Finally i would like to be able to stream content to the phone , tablet/other computer etc so instead of just being a remote it can also a player / viewer.
 
Id like to be able to do the above with a simple and reliable UI as would like it to be useable by others in the house, Im not hugely tech savvy but I will persevere my gf for example would not.
 
So is the above feasible ? 
Suggestions for set up/software/hardware

Bits I currently have that I would like to use (to save costs) but it isnt critical are

1 x HTPC – dual core processor, 4gb ram, hd5450, 2.5 tb storage over 2 drives, running xbmc, and ubuntu 12.10
2 x raspberry pi
1 x ps3 (I know it can stream from, but only some filetypes)
1 x netbook low spec running Ubuntu 10.1
1 x laptop mid spec running Ubuntu 10.1

Here are some questions I have that I hope you guys can answer:

I've always perceived HTPCs to be the ultimate solution to my entertainment needs. From my understanding they can pretty much play any digital format local and online, are capable of backing up and playing physical media, and more recently can double as a gaming machine for the living room. This sounds ideal, meaning I wouldn't need to buy a blu ray player since my htpc will have one, I wouldn't need a set top box because I have Netflix and amazon VOD, and now I wouldn't really need a gaming console because of steam's big picture. In other words it sounds like an all in one solution for my home entertainment needs.

Now here are my questions: 

1: is blu ray playback equal in audio and visual quality to a high quality blu ray player?

2: I've read on several forums that Netflix streaming and Amazon VOD block PCs from receiving 1080p quality content, and only stream standard def to fight piracy.... Is this true? Is there any way around this?

3: my goal would be to backup my Blu rays onto NAS and access them through my HTPC. Do Blu rays lose any quality when backed up? What is the best format to back them up?

4: does audio quality suffer in any way when going through an HTPC? Is it possible to connect a surround sound system to an HTPC? If so what additional equipment would I need?

5: is HTPC gaming really worth it? I know Steam's big picture is still in beta, but is it worth investing in a system that is capable of gaming?  Or should I just use a console in the living room and a gaming PC somewhere else for actual PC gaming?

6: once we get some of these questions answered can you guys help/guide me with my build?

1332783331.0,12,self.htpc,regos,My experience of moving from TiVo to HTPC,14,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/regos/my_experience_of_moving_from_tivo_to_htpc/,"I'm a TiVo user who's in the midst of migrating to a HTPC setup.  I wanted to share my experiences and impressions for anyone who's thinking about making a similar switch.

I've been on TiVo for about 7 years, the last 4 on a Series 3 HD box.  My TiVo setup included two Comcast cablecards, and an external 1.5TB DVR expander hard drive.   My TiVo outputs via HDMI to a 46"" Sony Bravia HD LCD set and a 5.1 receiver/speaker setup.

I've been very happy with TiVo -- it just works, day in and day out.  The basic TiVo mission of recording and playing back programs is rock-solid.  Some of the TiVo add-ons, like on-demand video, YouTube, photo sharing, etc. are less successful, but as a DVR, my TiVo has worked flawlessly.

So why would I switch?  Mainly I'm tired of paying $12.95/month for the privilege of using a piece of hardware that I own.  There are also other things I'd like to do on my TV, like surf the web, show streaming web video, or view pictures from a digital camera, that TiVo doesn't do quite as seamlessly as it could.  Also, I was curious about the whole HTPC phenomenon (if you could call it that yet).

I wanted to stay with cable because the broadcast choices in my area are terrible, and neither is my internet connection up to the task of supplying all my video needs.  So when I saw the price of the Ceton Infinitv Cablecard tuner card drop, I jumped on it and ordered one.

Building a HTPC seems like the thing to do, but I didn't really have any interest or experience in doing that, so I looked around for a prepackaged PC that would fit my needs, and settled on the Lenovo H330 (Intel i5 cpu, 8gb DDR3 ram, 2 TB disk, Win7 home premium 64 bit, AMD Radeon 6450 video card).  I connected this into my system right next to the TiVo, with HDMI running to the receiver/HDTV, and connected to my home LAN.

With the PC and tuner card both in hand, I took one of the cablecards out of my TiVo, and went through Ceton's installation.  This was mostly painless, but with one fairly serious glitch -- the Ceton card has a ""network tuner"" feature, which is supposed to allow other PCs on your network to receive a tuner feed from the card.  When I selected this option during the card setup, the PC crashed, hard, and apparently took the disk boot sector with it.  My only choice for recovery was to restore the entire disk from the hidden system recovery partition.

With the Ceton card installed, I called up Comcast's support line to pair and activate the cablecard.  This process has gotten much easier since the last time I had to activate a cablecard through Comcast.  They actually have a dedicated phone number for this task, with operators who know what to do.  The whole activation/pairing process took about five minutes and worked the first time.

So now everything's been hooked up, and I've been running the TiVo and HTPC side-by-side for the last month, preparing to make the switchover permanent. I've added a Rosewill HTPC remote to the setup, and programmed its commands into my Logitech Harmony remote.  I've also added a Logitech K400 wireless keyboard/touchpad combo, because the little handheld keyboard/remote that Lenovo sells is only marginally useful.

After a month of use, I have to say that the HTPC with Windows 7 Media Center compares very favorably to Tivo.  It's not quite as rock-solid as the TiVo, which runs on top of Linux.  If not for power failures, the uptime on that box would be easily in the hundreds of days.  The Win7 HTPC has frozen a few times, requiring reboot.  The most problematic area of the HTPC seems to be in how it handles sleep/standby mode.  Coming out of sleep, it takes a long time to reconnect with the tuner card output, and occasionally shows bogus copyright or connectivity error messages while doing so.  For now I'm leaving the HTPC on all the time, and looking into apps that manage sleep settings.

The basic recording and live TV functionality of Windows Media Center is right on, supporting nearly every feature that TiVo offers as far as scheduling, season passes, media guide, manual recording, and interface navigation.  Plus it does so much more, like seamless integration with photos, videos and music on my home network, internet TV, sharing with other computers, etc.  Add in all the things you can do with Windows 7 itself -- web, games, etc. -- and the TiVo starts to look a little clunky by comparison.

The program guide is one area where WMC has impressed me.  I had always operated under the belief that this was TiVo's big differentiator, the thing that made them worth $12.95/month.  At this point I can't see much advantage if any to TiVo's guide -- the one available through WMC seems up-to-date and accurate, and links in a lot more information in the form of movie reviews.  Plus some of the alternate guide views, like single-channel and upcoming showings, are superior to what TiVo offers.  And the fine control available over WMC's recurring recordings are vastly superior to TiVo's Season Pass setup.  So far I have found only one thing that TiVo does that WMC can't do, and that's to set a scheduled recording to start early by a specified number of minutes.  WMC starts all recordings 3 minutes early by default.  TiVo allows the user to specify a number of minutes to start early, up to an hour I believe.

Video quality?  Well, I can't say the Radeon 6450 is quite up to the level of the TiVo's dedicated hardware, which itself is a slight step down from straight unrecorded HD.  For regular TV watching, the 6450 is more than passable, quite good in fact.  Color saturation seems a bit duller than the TiVo's video output, and contains more pixelation and motion artifacts.  A better video card would probably solve some of these issues, although I'm limited by the small form factor of the H330's case.

Noise hasn't really been an issue.  The H330 is a pretty quiet PC, even when I'm pushing it with multiple video streams recording.  My Playstation 3 is several times louder.

So in conclusion, if you're thinking about making the leap from TiVo to a HTPC, do it if you want to get more functionality out of your media setup than the TiVo can offer.  Don't do it if pristine video is a requirement for everyday viewing and you're unwilling to build or spec out a very high end video PC.  And if you're already on a lifetime TiVo subscription, the economics of switching may not make sense. 

TL;DR:  I'm switching from TiVo to HTPC and it's going very well.

1372412585.0,11,self.htpc,1h8mx2,Some HTPC Build Help Please! I'm a tad confused.,11,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1h8mx2/some_htpc_build_help_please_im_a_tad_confused/,"Hi Guys,

Before I go about resetting up my HTPC box, I'd like to ask a little bit of advice. These are the components I have for my setup and I'll post my wanted configuration of it, and can anyone tell me the best way to go about doing this...

Ideally I'd want everything to be away somewhere. I want it to not ever really be seen and I detest cables, but I don't mind the odd cable or two. What I want is everything in a cupboard which will stream to 2 rooms. I've tried a couple of configuration, and this is what I felt is best, but please point me out if I'm going in the right direction. 

This is what I'd like and please make any recommendations as you see fit. 

I'd like my 2 xbox's and my HTPC put away in to a cupboard (or in the lounge in a unit) . These Xbox'es are different, that being one is a J-Tagged Xbox and the other a normal 4GB Slim Xbox. I have different games on both, but I'd like them  both to be able to be played and accessed  in both my bedroom and in the lounge. I don't plan on playing both at the same time, it's more a matter of being able to play both Xboxes in both rooms. Adding onto that, I have a HTPC box, which I'm still unsure whether I'd like to have to run all the time as I don't see it entirely neccesasry and I'm mostly home in the evening. I had planned on putting SABNZDB onto the HTPC, but after a bit of research I found out that I can use the Raspberry Pi as an always on Usenet download and to host all my Usenet programs. (Sickbeard/Couchpotato/Headphones/Sabnzdb), but I'm not entirely sure the process I'd go about making the Raspberry Pi into a dedicated always on box that will be able to download shows (say to a  single 2TB hard drive ) (which I would then manually move the data when it's full to my HTPC box) wirelessly (or wired). 
	- In essence the Rasberry Pi would be a usenet download to literally download to a 2TB constantly which I'd be able to access via Windows Explorer and be able to move onto  my HTPC box (this is depending on if I'd use the Raspberry as a USEnet machine or my HTPC box)
	
Now I thought about taking this setup, putting it into my lounge into a cabinet (with the HTPC, Xboxes and Potential Raspi USENET machine (with my router) and putting it into the lounge (hidden) with a HDMI swictch(I have a manual HDMI switch and then into a HDMI Splitter - From this point where would I go. Would I use a CAT5 HDMI extender or a Wireless HDMI set. I'm looking for a good solution with the cheapeast overall costs in the end. I have 10m HDMI extension cable which I currently use to hide stuff. 

All of these components would go into my projector which is in the lounge (projector only has one HDMI) and there's the second LCD in the bedroom.

Carrying on from this point, the setup gets a little more complicated. All of these devices (say in the lounge) need to be able to have a shared library. The HTPC (the main XBMC library) would reside on the HTPC itself, and I was thinking of 1 or 2 things, but I'll take advice please, and I beg for it. 

A couple more points I'm not too sure about: Should

1. Use the Raspi as a XBMC ""dummy box"". That being setup it up in the bedroom (instead of using the Raspi as a USEnet box. My main issue comes that I don't really see the point if I'm trying to get both xbox's to my bedroom, I might as well just send the HTPC signal as well to the LCD in the bedroom. I don't really see the need for the Raspi as a Media Centre then, as I'll have 2 XBMC's running and correct me if I'm wrong, there will no point. I'd use my Logitech Harmony with the projector, (flirc) and then I'd just use me or the girlfriends smarthphone or something as the remote. I'm not too stressed as I guess I could always just get a remote blaster, and have a second remote for the bedroom.

2. Should I rather use the Pi then (based on the above point) as my USEnet downloader. I really don't want my HTPC to be on all day (it's my server too, which I don't really need to access all the time). Will the Raspi work as a USEnet downloader which scans my Samba and NFS and Fat32 drives (all in the HTPC) and then commence on its work. I'd like to be able to have the Raspi running, download to a 2TB spare, and then move stuff off that to the HTPC hard drives? Is this a viable solution. As well, Could I inconjunction with this Headphones/Sickbeard/Couchpotato suite use my Raspi at the same time as a way of managing my network using DyDNS etc etc. 

3. The best and cheapest solution for the 2xbox/HTPC sharing amongst rooms solution. Wireless HDMI looks awesome, but I don't mind running a 10M cable or investing in a CAT5 HDMI extender. 

4. I'm not from the States, so I use Overplay SmartDNS to watch HULU/Netflix but I feel it slows down my internet. This is another consideration why I'd have liked the Pi as a USEnet downloader instead of a Media watcher (The Pi has been in the bedroom as a XBMC watcher thing). I could use OVerplay on the HTPC Linux build and leave a faster DNS for my Raspi downloader. I'm not looking at speeds over 800kpbs so I'm not too stressed. I just want the HTPC / Xboxes to be able to use the SmartDNS if need be.  whats the solution? I also want to protect my home network. Can the Pi do all this as once?

I'm not sure, I am trying researching planning and getting it done, but I could use some advice please.

This is on a Dell Optiplex 745 Desktop (C2D 2.16ghz, 4gb RAM, ATI Raedon 6000).  An older computer with upgraded RAM and video card.

I wasn't able to upgrade, had to do a fresh install since I was going from 7 Ultimate to 8 Enterprise, which presented some challenges.  I don't really store anything on my HTPC, so I didn't have to backup any data.

Once I got used to the fact that the Start orb/menu is now dedicated to an entire screen - I was sold on it's use for this purpose.  This new screen is very similar to having Launchpad on a Mac run constantly IMO.

Now here's what blew me away, I ran the windows rating tests on this machine and it ranked in at a 5.8 - only 2 tenths behind my much newer C2D machine.

Here's my synopsis.

If you use WMC for your ""frontend"": I have nothing to say as of yet, I haven't got one of those free keys to add the new WMC.

If you don't use WMC - this will be perfect for the ""users"" in your life.  Just like using a tablet or smartphone as long as it's setup properly.  The 2 main programs I use on this machine are Plex and Skype, instead of double clicking a small icon on my 1080 screen, now it's a large ""Metro"" tile with a single click.

I just hope the store is actually supported and developed, something Microsoft has a bad record of doing.

Been wanting to build a dedicated HTPC for XBMC for a while now, and Steam's Big Picture release finally got me to pull the trigger.  This was only my third ever build.  Here's the build:

It ended up being significantly cheaper than that because I get Windows free, and used some parts that were laying around from older builds.  Also, the TV it's hooked up to is a [LG 47"" 3D-capable LED TV](http://www.amazon.com/LG-47LM6200-47-Inch-LED-LCD-Glasses/dp/B006ZH0KCK).

The case is gorgeous, and was pretty much exactly what I wanted an HTPC case to look like, but I unfortunately didn't do enough research before purchasing it.  It features two hot swappable hard drive bays, but I had to remove them in order to fit my PSU in, as well as one of the case fans that comes with it.  It wasn't a big deal for me, since I'm only using the SSD for this build and pulling all movies in from my home network, but if you want to use one of the silverstone HTPC cases, definitely read the measurement restrictions carefully.

Cable management was a bit difficult, but that was expected in this size of case, and, overall, I don't think it came out too bad.  Idle temps on the 560 Ti are low 50s degC and the i5 is running at around 45 degC with only the two remaining case fans and stock CPU cooler, but I'm going to look into some better cooling solutions to try to get those temperatures down just a bit.

I also am using a Hauppage IR remote that came with one of their tv tuners to control XBMC, and occasionally connect my wireless apple keyboard over bluetooth to surf the net.

Also, wanted to thank this subreddit for being generally awesome.  I got a lot of great ideas off of here.

I have 2x2GB sticks of DDR3 so I can easily bump it up to 4GB and I have a spare copy of Windows 7 so the lack of OS is not a problem. My TV is 1080p so I would be running this over HDMI at 1920x1080 and I have the optical passthrough on my TV running to my receiver for audio.

Things I like:

* It can be mounted to the VESA mount on the back of my TV
* Low power consumption
* Small/out of the way
* Inexpensive

Things I don't like:

* Can't upgrade parts (video card/cpu)
* Underpowered?

I will not be setting up SABnzbd/Sick Beard/etc because I am not replacing my TV service with this (if I was, I would build something better). I will be using this to watch movies/shows that I download, some light gaming (emulators or old stuff like Doom or Quake), maybe some casual web browsing, and streaming video (Hulu/YouTube/Netflix).

I'm wondering if this thing is any good or if I would be better off spending a bit extra to build out a cheap i3/A4/A6 system with a Radeon 5450 or something like that.",,False,self,t5_2rbfy,False,,,True,t3_s8g66,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/s8g66/how_is_the_zotac_zbox/,

After looking at a lot of HTPC posts, I decided to go with the parts above. **Note:** I couldn't find the motherboard listed, but I chose the [ASRock H61M/U3S3 for $69.99 at Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157236). This brings the total price to ~$516 (excluding the hard drives).

** After some discussion on [/r/buildapc](/r/buildapc) I'm also thinking about switching the i5 processor with either an i3 2120T (power consumption), i3 2125 (cheaper than 2120T at microcenter) or an Amd A8 APU. 

So what do you guys think? Can i downsize in terms price/performance? Can i improve the energy efficiency? As i mentioned earlier I'd like to be as energy efficient as possible since I'll be running this PC all the time.

Also, do I need a GPU if I go with any of these processors? All of them can handle HD playback but transcoding to my mobile devices might be an issue from what I've heard.

Ultimately I ended up with two really great machines that cost me less than I had budgeted and handle everything I ask them to do.


Hopefully this parts list will be useful to some of you:


**CPU: Intel Celeron G530** (2.4ghz dual-core Sandybridge) with HD 2000 onboard graphics. (I actually have one G620 and one G530, but they perform the same and the G530 is much cheaper) - $40 at [Microcenter](http://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0373701) (or $45 shipped at [Macmall](http://www.macmall.com/p/product~dpno~8871733~pdp.gijidae;jsessionid=F7E801473EE21CBC8AD7DA84F1F8D4D0?emOmni=null&amp;source=MWBGOOGLEBASE) if you don't live near Microcenter).

**Motherboard: MSI H61M-E33 (Open Box)** - $64 at [Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130588R) (I paid $50, but the price has gone up)

**HDD: 500GB 7200RPM WD Caviar Blue (Refurb)** - $25 shipped from Blinq.com's eBay store. (Due to the current HDD shortage this component will likely cost you more. [Here](http://www.ebay.com/itm/SEAGATE-320GB-SATA-ST3320820AS-APPLE-GENUINE-MAC-DESKTOP-HARD-DRIVE-7200RPM-/180766270378?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2a168263aa#ht_1207wt_1026)'s a 320GB refurb for $40.)

**RAM: 2GB DDR3 Microcenter Brand** - $10 at [Microcenter](http://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0353218) (Actually a 2x2GB pack for $20 that I split between the two machines, but RAM is cheap, so you should be able to hit close to this price point even for a single stick.)

**Case: Sentey Slim mATX** with 450W Power Supply - $40 at [Microcenter](http://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0357147).

**Total:** ~~~$175~~ $165 (edit: math is hard) (Maybe a little more now that HDDs are expensive and the mobo went up, but you should still come in at or under $200 if you do a little bargain hunting, especially with all the xmas sales going on.)

**Notes:**

I planned to get 4GB of RAM, but the more I read, the more I realized for my purposes, 2GB would probably be enough, so I tried it and it is plenty.

The HD 2000 onboard graphics are great. For a dedicated 1080p HTPC, I have found I do not need a discrete GPU to achieve excellent performance. I use these for watching HD Netflix, downloaded movies in WMC, live and DVR'd HDTV in WMC, Hulu Desktop and HBO Go in Chrome all without issue and with a clearer image than I used to get from my old HD Comcast DVR box.

For live TV, I am using an HD Homerun ($70 used on eBay) hooked to my home network. If you go this route, I recommend a wired ethernet connection to the PC for optimal quality.

They are kind of big. Especially after using the Revos, the size of the mATX cases was a little disappointing, but I just tucked them behind the component stands and control them with WMC remotes (~$15 on Amazon) via a USB IR receiver, so they are now completely out of sight. If you want something that will sit on your component stand and look like a DVR, you should plan to spend a bit more on a Mini ITX board and case.

They are a tad loud. When I'm watching something, I can't hear the fans at all, but I prefer to run them around the clock so I can access files from other computers on the network, and when the rest of the room is silent, the fan noise is noticeable. It's annoying since the machines run very cool, so it's unnecessary. I just ordered some $9 Zalman fan controllers from Amazon and expect those to solve the issue.

No optical drive. I already have a PS3 on one TV and DVD player on the other, so I didn't need optical drives. Obviously this will add to your costs if you need them. I already had keyboards and mice, so they're not included either. An OS will also add to the costs if you don't already have a copy of Windows or don't want to use Linux.

Anyway, that's my setup. You could certainly spend more, and it's not the ideal box for everyone, but it has met all my needs and made me very happy, so hopefully this will help some of you.

How does this look?,14,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1beugy/building_two_htpcs_how_does_this_look/,"I've been tasked with putting together two HTPCs for home. One for my parents and the other for me, to replace a re-purposed box that will likely be re-purposed again into a FreeNAS server.

Since all of the files will either be on my main computer as they are now, or on the server once that's been built, I've opted to use SSDs for faster boot/load times.

I was originally going to go with something slightly smaller, using Mini-ITX instead of Micro-ATX but found that when I put everything into a Power Supply calculator it came out as a recommended wattage of 156, just over the 150 that came with the case I was looking at. So I decided to move up to Micro-ATX and chose a case that came with a 380w PSU

After looking around for various part recommendations that are also easily available to me (I'm in Australia) I've come up with this. I had to use the US Sites for PCPartPicker since not everything was showing up in the Australian listings. The price works out to roughly the same.

I'm trying to decide between an **Intel Core i3-3225 ($133)** or go budget with it and get an **Intel Celeron G555 ($54)**.

From all of my research, it seems the Celeron is more than capable of handling 1080p content, locally or streamed.  The only thing stopping me from settling on it is the i3 has Intel Clear Video HD Technology...

&gt;&gt;**Intel Clear Video Technology** (from wiki)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;According to Intel, Clear Video Technology enables; Enhanced high-definition video playback, Sharper images, Precise color control, and Advanced display capability.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Intel Clear Video Technology Features and benefits:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;* MPEG-2 decode iDCT + motion compensation. Up to 2 stream support (1 HD and 1 SD)
&gt;&gt;* De-interlacing Advanced pixel adaptive (SD/HD-1080i)
&gt;&gt;* Color control ProcAmp: brightness, hue, saturation, contrast.
&gt;&gt;* Video scaling 4x4 scaling
&gt;&gt;* Digital Display Support (through SDVO) Digital Video Interface (DVI), High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI)
&gt;&gt;* Display support RGB (QXGA), HDMI, UDI, DVI, HDTV (1080i/p, 720p), Composite, Component, S-Video (via Intel Serial Digital Video Out), TV-out, CRT
&gt;&gt;* Aspect ratio 16:9, 4:3, letterbox
&gt;&gt;* Maximum resolution support 2048 x 1536 at 75 Hz, RGB (QXGA) 

I can find next to no personal accounts on how good this tech is or if it's just marketing flair.  I have no idea if playback software must support it to benefit from it or not.  I've seen a couple people in forums claim it's significantly better.  It's really frustrating that no real world information is available about this tech.  If what they say it does is true, it should be important to most HTPC enthusiasts.  I just can't validate Intel's claims as of yet.

Not just that but after learning about HTPC a little there's no way I'd fork out the money for a TiVo and pay a subscription on top of it. HDHomeRun Prime seems to be what I want, but in going to their web site I'm a bit confused when it comes to encrypted channels.

* According to the silicon dust website it seems you need windows 7 media center to be able to view encrypted channels, is that right? 

* Does that mean Windows Vista or Windows 8 media center would not work? 

* Does every device that I want to watch from have to then have Windows 7 Media Center? Or does only one have to have it and then you can just stream the video to other devices via DLNA or something? 

I ask because I have multiple devices in my house and I'm trying to figure out what would work with this. I have two google tv boxes, an iMac, Windows 8 laptop, Windows 8 PC, and a Windows Vista PC. The Windows Vista PC is the only machine that I have that has Windows Media Center.

I got all my parts for a real total of: $568.65 -I took an old OCZ Vertex 2 ssd from my current build.


You know that feeling once you build a computer, then you are broke, but the only thing you want to do is build another one? Well I convinced my father we NEEDED this for the house to take advantage of my seedbox and private trackers (when really my hard drives can't hold anymore). The plan is to use this as a file library for all movies, shows, music, as well as a back up for important documents. 

The build was rough in the beginning. Here are some problems I ran into:
&gt; * I first ordered a Corsair PSU with only 4 SATA connections - forgot about my SSD to run Windows. Luckily since I didn't open it and realized right after I ordered Newegg RMA'd it for nothing.
&gt; * The god dam case - while it's a thing of beauty, the PSU mounting holes didn't line up with the bracket. I had to do a little case modification with metal cutters.
&gt; * Worst of all, the case said it supported Micro-ATX boards. When I went to examine the standoffs I realized that nope, that wasn't the case. I thought I screwed up, checked the specs on newegg for the mobo and the case AND the box for the case and they all said it was compatible, but I can assure there were no options to add stand offs for that. I ended up leaving a bunch out, which meant I had to be super careful not to push my SATA connectors to hard onto the end of the unsupported mobo.

You guys helped me a lot, when I found this sub-reddit it opened up a wealth of information I had never come across, and I thank you all. 


The only problems I have left to figure out is how the hell to get the sound to my TV. I have the HDMI plugged into the TV, and I have a receiver hooked up to a 5.1 system as well. Everywhere I'm reading says to plug in an HDMI to a receiver as well, which I only have one of. Also, XBMC is frustrating to set up? I can't for the life of me add the default pathway to where I want to put media I set up. I also want to set up my harmony remote, but I have to get an IR receiver first. Anyway - critique, feedback, or any comments are much appreciated. Thanks again.

(X-post from /r/buildapcforme)",12,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/11rjs7/us_basic_whole_house_htpc_setup_to_become_a_cord/,"I didn't get much feedback over at /r/buildapcforme so I thought I would try here. I would appreciate any input on this build. Hopefully together we can come up with a solution that can be an example for anyone with a family wanting to do this.

I am looking for a home theater pc setup so I can cut my satellite cord. I would like to keep the cost at a minimum but I understand that it could get expensive quickly so I don't have a budget yet. Therefore I am planning on building this in stages.

First I will tell you **what I have:**

* Total of 4 tvs in the house. All tvs can receive HDMI input.

* The main tv in the living room has a blue-ray player and surround sound.

* 1 Roku 2XS with the plex channel

* 1 [Acer Aspire 5810TZ] laptop with a useless screen. At the very least I can use the Windows License key to upgrade to Windows 7.

* A crap-ton of dvd’s we need to rip and store centrally.

**What I need:**

* A basic htpc for each tv (a total of 3 since I think we can use the Roku for one of the kids, more on that below)

* A central pc to be the media server and do the LEGAL torrenting. My internet connection is super slow so I was going to schedule the torrenting while I am at work or asleep.

* At least 2 of the tvs (the main one and the one is our bedroom) to be able to stream from Netflix, Hulu, etc.

* The 2 kids’ tvs can survive on local content and don’t need streaming. HOWEVER, they will need to be able to play rented dvd’s. I guess I could just hook the dvd player up to the tv separate from the htpc, it would be nice to have one less box by the tv though.

I was thinking I could start with a couple of the basic htpcs and build the Media server later so if you post a list of components please break the list down into what I need for each stage of the build. I could put my local content on an external HD for now and get by with it for a little while. The Media server will sit on a shelf in the pantry next to the router and be hard-wired to each of the tvs.

If you have a different way of laying this out I am open to suggestions. With a family of 5 it is difficult to cut the cord but I am determined to get there eventually. I will happily Paypal someone a few $$$ for their help on this.

**TL;DR Help a family of 5 cut their cord with a whole house htpc set-up and maybe get a few $$$ in the process.**

Sorry for the wall of text. I appreciate any and all input as I have never built a pc before.

Something to note, if you're thinking of using this case, is that two of the four stock screws did not reach through the SSD and the cradle so you can either try to find some screws that will work or be content with just two screws holding the SSD down.  The HDD is mounted underneath the optical drive. 

I didn't have a ton of success [managing wires](http://i.imgur.com/rOGOK.jpg) but it worked out I guess. 

Even without an optical drive, this case was a little tight to work in, but overall I am happy with it because I wanted something small enough that it wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb among my [other devices](http://i.imgur.com/RkOCx.jpg)

**Goals**  
* **Low Cost**: I previously built a decent PC thanks to /r/buildapc, but I want to add functionality and efficiency to our current home theater set up. This setup will not have to run graphics-intensive games.  
* **Declutter**: Current home theater furniture setup consists of a Denon 1613 AVR, cable box, PS3, router and receiver, laptop, and a ton of dvds/blurays.  I'd like to get rid of the dvd cases by ripping them with MakeMKV and sticking them on storage as I get more funds for more drives; ditch the ugly cable box; stop using the PS3 for blurays and move it to another location for gaming; and, get rid of the laptop for internet access (it's a pain and unsightly to plug in the VGA and 3.5mm audio, then unplug and take it elsewhere).  Even with cableporn, it's a nightmare behind there.  
* **Stream** HBOGO, Amazon Instant, Netflix, Pandora, and possibly others as new services pop up.  
* **Play music** from multiple iTunes libraries and CDs ripped to networked computers.  
* **Internet access**.  
* **Cable DVR** - The company box is pretty ugly and large.  I haven't included a cable card reader in this setup, because pcpartpicker didn't have an option.  I'd like some suggestions, please.  
* **Centralized control** - I'd like suggestions about remotes, since we are currently juggling four or five.  I have a Vizio TV remote that is actually quite excellent due to it's small size and a full, tactile QWERTY keyboard on the back.  Ideally, the remote will also be useful for internet access.  Is there an iPhone or iPad app for that?  I'm aware of Hippo, but not sure if it will work on this.  

**Future Goals**  
* Add a **server** as I rip our DVD/Bluray collection.  
* Add a **Bluray drive** for friends who come over and share discs.
* Ability to control **home automation and home security** - cameras, temperature, lights.  
* Add control for speakers in different areas of the house - this may be an AVR upgrade, though.

I was planning on using Linux/XBMC/Plex.

Alternatively, I have an older **Mac Mini** sitting around with about 2Gb of ram in it. I would have to get a DVI to HDMI adapter and use a headphone jack for audio.  I found this [link](http://macintegration.blogspot.com/p/mac-mini-htpc.html) on the topic and thought I'd share.

We only have about 20GB of hard drive space on the unit.  We love the cable channel lineup and the high speed internet though, so we thought we would check into HTPC.
I was thinking a setup with a Cable Card tuner running W7/WMC, but had a few questions.

1. We have an extensive DVD/Blu Ray library and would love to store rips of these on a hard drive (as well as DVR content).  Most of our discs are DVD.  How big would the files be for let's say a two hour movie with a good compression codec at 720p? How big are the WMC files at 720p?

2.  Can I use a program like MCEBuddy to remove commercials in WMC?  Is there a way to set up an “autobatch” where whenever a video on the DVR is finished recording, the program will run, keep the original file (in case something messes up), and creates a commercialess file?  How long would this process take for let's say an hour tv show?  Is there a similar setup to convert CopyOnce to CopyFreely (not sure how my cable provider tags the channels).

3.  For Non-DVR content, I'm not sure to go with XBMC or Plex.  There is one problem we've always had with some of our TV Series DVDs (mostly HBO)...that there isn't a Play All.  So if we decide to play Season 2 of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' before bed, can I set it to automatically play the second episode after the first ends (without creating something like a playlist each time)?

4. Follow up question, if 3 is possible can I set up a “sleep timer” in any of these software packages?  I wasn't sure if it was possible to stop playing or just shut down after a certain amount of time to reduce wear on the HD/System.

5.  Our ISP has the 3 strikes your out rule, so I'm not trying to torrent/sickbeard any television shows, but possibly take advantage of services offered by legal services like Hulu, NBC.com, Revision 3, etc.  Are there stable plugins/extensions for XBMC or Plex that I can watch videos hosted by these sites (regular Hulu not plus).  What about for services like Netflix or Vudu?  Would I just use the browser like a computer?

6.  I would like to make this setup as easy to use as possible for my wife. What do you recommend as far as programs, addons, remote controls, where it will “feel” less like a PC and more like a DVR 2.0 for her?

7.  We're thinking about making the main server HTPC in the living room, and having additional HTPC “clients” in the basement and bedroom.  We have a coax hookup (obviously) in the living room, but our modem and wifi router are in the office with our computers, will Wifi be fine networking all of these units together? (aka pulling a video from the main living room computer's hard drive to the computer in the bedroom?)  I think pulling cable is out, if wifi won't work, what about powerline adapters? Or would using a splitter in the living room, one for the modem/router and the other for the cable card be the best option?

8.  Lastly, with WMC, is there a way to give the DVR a buffer for ten minutes at the beginning and end of a recording?  Our old DVR has been cutting the ends off of shows and it is irritating us.

1371948662.0,9,self.htpc,1gvusy,Right time to switch from JBOD to RAID?,11,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1gvusy/right_time_to_switch_from_jbod_to_raid/,"Hopefully this is the right place for this, but if it's not, steer me in the right direction.  About 5 years ago I built a gaming rig as at the time I was really into PC gaming.  Years later I have a family and spend less time gaming, so it's been relegated to being my automatic download machine/file server which I have a HTPC in the living room it serves to.


The equipment it has in it currently is...

* Antec 1200 PC case (Loads of room for HDD's)
* 3 x 1 TB Western Digital Black HDD's
* EVGA 132-YW-E180-A1 Mobo (This has an onboard RAID controller that I'm looking at using)

My problem now is that the 3 TB of storage I have is almost full and I want to upgrade, so my thought was to buy a 3TB Seagate since it's the sweet spot for price now along with good reviews.  I had leaned towards doing RAID 5 for some redundancy, but now that I find they all need to be the same size, or take a big storage loss, I'm not sure what to do.  I think I have a few options.

* Use the 3 x 1TB in a RAID and keep adding 1 TB drives at a time
* Convert to using 3TB drives (meaning I'd need to get 2 more for a RAID 5)
* Use a different file system (Keep it JBOD like it currently is, or I hear ZFS is pretty flexible?)

What are /htpc's thoughts on this?  The reason I want redundancy is because I don't have physical copies of most of the media on my server, and wouldn't want to re-acquire it, and take the time to do so.  My only fear with throwing more disks in a JBOD is that at some point some of these 5 year old HDD's (I've bought one about every 1.5 years since I built the computer) will fail and I'll lose everything.  Thanks!

Edit:  One final question I had was, if I go the route of getting 3 x 3TB drives for the RAID, what can I do with the 3 x 1TB drives I'll have sitting around, can/should I install the OS to one?  Or have multiple disks existing outside of the array?

1369073504.0,10,self.htpc,1ephm0,Send custom popup messages to WMC!,14,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1ephm0/send_custom_popup_messages_to_wmc/,"For the longest time, I've been trying to find a way to have custom messages popup on top of WMC based on certain events. For instance, I wanted the content of ESPN text alerts to display on my TV so that I could easily see sports updates even if I'm not watching the game. I tried using EventGhost's popup message plugin, but unfortunately it will not display on top of a full screen WMC. To do this, you would need to hook into WMC's message service.

After extensive research, I finally came across a program that might work. Here's the thread on an Australian media center forum: [**http://www.pcmediacenter.com.au/forum/topic/45552-new-plugin-mc-message-pop-up/**](http://www.pcmediacenter.com.au/forum/topic/45552-new-plugin-mc-message-pop-up/)

As described, the program allows the user to push custom messages to WMC which would then popup even if full screened. You can control the header text, body text, and the timeout duration. PERFECT!

But... unfortunately the download server of that forum was down and I could not get a response from the original developer. Eventually I did track down the program and I have added a mirror: [**http://www.filedropper.com/mcepopup**](http://www.filedropper.com/mcepopup)

The instructions from the forum post:

&gt;Installation:
Download the zip file from downloads section and extract to a location of your choice.
close media center and make sure you don't have any active recordings in progress.
Installation needs to be done under full administrative rights from a command prompt. (right click on the command prompt shortcut and select run as administrator)
navigate to your extracted files and type INSTALL and press enter
it's a little messy, but the last line should read 'Success'
start media center then minimize it.
If you have windows firewall active, you will probably have a prompt requesting access for ehexthost.exe. You must allow this. If you have windows firewall enabled and you don't receive a prompt, or another type of software firewall running on your media center box, you may have to manually add an exception/allowance for UDP port 11000.

&gt;As a quick test, from the install directory, run the sender tool as follows:
MCPopupSend.exe 127.0.0.1 20 ""Test"" ""This is the message""
maximise media center and you should have a popup message.

&gt;If this all works, take a copy of MCPopupend.exe and simply put it on another PC/laptop of your choice

&gt;You can completely remove the plugin by running INSTALL /u from the installation folder.

For more information and full details, visit the original thread. Additionally, you can easily send messages to this program with a simply Python Script triggered by EventGhost. The script is:

    from socket import socket, AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM
    data = 'Caption|Message Text|30'
    port = 11000
    hostname = '127.0.0.1'
    udp = socket(AF_INET,SOCK_DGRAM)
    udp.sendto(data, (hostname, port))

Simply change the IP to the IP of the computer running the program and WMC and alter the Caption, Message Text, and timeout duration (in seconds). Run the script through eventghost and you should see a popup message in WMC! Using variables, you can deliver dynamic text such as the message from a Text alert.",,False,self,t5_2rbfy,False,,,True,t3_1ephm0,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1ephm0/send_custom_popup_messages_to_wmc/,

Where I am? Well... I bought an overkill dream machine with the vague idea of future-proofing, and maybe some video game emulation:

* Silverstone GD04B
* Antec HCG 400W
* Gigabyte GAZ77M-D3H-MVP
* I5 3570k
* 16G DDR3 1600
* 64G Samsung 830 boot drive
* HDHomeRun HDHR3-US
* No discrete video, leaves me room for a big performance kick, should I ever want it.

So, not just a powerful system, but by far the highest quality computer I have put together for myself in my 15 years of IT.  It makes me happy just to look at it, but now that it is together I'm not sure what to do with it.  I have been trying in vain to figure out a truly solid appliance like package, I really just want to set this sucker up and not touch it for the next 7 years. Unfortunately, between the myriad of options and my total lack of experience, I have just stalled out.  Advice would be highly appreciated.

Ok, to start, I am going to assume XBMC is at least the one thing I can be sure of.  

Should I go with Frodo Beta or Eden?  My gut tells me that since I require PVR functionality, I should install Frodo and upgrade it to a stable version as soon as I can.

Should I use Xmbcbuntu, Windows 7 with shell replacement, or Windows 8?  I really would rather avoid linux, but if the reason is compelling I can bite the bullet.  I already installed Windows 7 Ultimate, but I can change if I have reason.  Windows 8 looks more like a ""10 foot interface"" and I have read some people say they liked it on forums, but nothing real solid.  Again, I am going for appliance-like

PVR Backend?  This one just has me lost, my options are to run this on the HTPC or on my 2011 Home Server (Core2 Duo, 8G DDR2) I can run native windows or install a VM and Linux if I want to.  Again, I want to avoid Linux if I can, but if it is really far better than the competition I will do it.  

Right now I am leaning towards NextPVR, it is windows native and people seem to like it.  Media Portal sounds good, but people say channel changes are incredibly slow.  There is the obvious Myth TV with the same critique (plus it is linux).  Out in left field there is TVHeadend with the poorest functionality of the group, but lightning quick response and currently being rapidly developed.  TvHeadend seems to have a lot of backing in the XMBC community,  It also is Linux.

So...any suggestions?

I don't think noise will be an issue as the PC will be tucked away in a cupboard.  
Will having 2 HDDs in RAID 1 produce a lot of heat? It'll be tucked away in a cupboard so heat could be an issue!

My only experience on the matter is the 7,200 drive I hacked into ODD bay of my laptop for extra storage and I've never noticed it getting hot, in fact it may be the coolest area of my laptop!

So - do you game via your rigs and if so, how?",9,1,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/znl38/steams_big_picture_10_ui_launches_today_got_me/,"I've got emulators for virtually every console ever, but other than a few days after setting it all up I've never played them.  Other than that I hadn't really attempted any sort of gaming - even though PC games are my preferred type and the living room is my preferred location.

I think it comes down to 3 problems for me:

* Interface -  I use Plex as my frontend, and while I do have a keyboard/mouse available I prefer to keep things as simple as possible and not use them.  I've never found a truly simple way to transition between Plex and a game (and back) without having to resort to mouse.
* Controller - I use a Mac Mini, and as such my controller options are a bit lighter than Windows boxes.  I picked up a couple of Logitech gamepads that do the job, but their battery life is awful and they lose connection like it's their job.  It became a situation where every time I decided I'd pick one up and try to play it became more work then it was worth.  I hear Xbox controllers work great, but they are so expensive comparatively.
* Gamestyle - This one is ultimately a personal choice, but the only PC game style I really like that seems playable via controller are platformers and maybe some first person RPGs.  RTS and Strategy titles are frustrating without mouse and I don't much care for FPS.  As such, as soon as I get excited about something like this it's tempered by the realization there really aren't that many games I actually *want* to play this way.

So, I'm not sure what the better option would be to run XMBC, Plex, or something else?  I know Plex is a fork of XMBX so they should be mostly the same, but theres always differences.

I know I will end up using some Rokus in the house, and I know they have Plex and Roksbox channels so I could access my content from either XMBC or Plex, but what about with GoogleTv?

First of all, I would like to keep the cost under 400$ (os price not included, i have a feeling this os will be windows 7 as I do not thing the android offerings offer enough power to do everything I need)

I like XBMC but am very open to other solutions/frontends.  I have used XBMC on windows, android, and on the original xbox.

Some kind of automated torrent/newsgroup download service/software will be used.  Currently im looking at sickbread and sabnzbd,coach potato for movies,headphones for movies.

Currently I have a jynxbox android based box, I am fairly familiar with android based devices, comfortable with trying custom roms ect.

I have built a few gaming pc's but have not built some for a couple years (circa 2010) so I am out of the hardware loop. I know i should be able to build something that will handle media without breaking the bank.

Zotac's zbox offering is a interesting concept.  Wondering if one of these may ultimately be the best solution.

Goals: low power, able to play any media format in high resolution (1080p) with no stutter or audio lag and surround sound (not sure on my definition of this yet as I do not have a receiver yet)

other info:  I have a 3tb network attached storage so storage isn't a major issue, most of the content will be streamed from the nas.  Also, my entire house is wired with Ethernet so wifi isn't needed (or wanted for that matter)

Upgrading from Wii.,8,1,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1ivfbi/emulation_htpc_build_help_upgrading_from_wii/,"For the past few years, I have been using a soft-modded Wii as a HTPC to stream audio/video files from my main PC over Wi-Fi, as well as play NES/SNES/N64/GCN/Wii backups. It has done this flawlessly and is a pretty great device for a beginning HTPC, however it is limited to outputting no higher than 480p. It never really was an issue until recently, because now whenever I try to download movies or tv shows they are 720p or higher, meaning I can’t watch them. This is my only real beef with this setup at this time.

That said I would like to start looking into building a PC to replace this awesome Wii. My budget is around $400-$500, and I plan on buying the bare minimum and upgrading as I am able. 

The only initial features I need are the ability to output 1080p video, store and play my media library (about  750GB of Music/Movies/TV/Game Backups), Access Netflix and play basic emulation (NES/SNES/N64/Genesis/GB/GBA/Maybe some MAME). 

By the time I am finished, however, I would like this pc to run all consoles up to Wii/PS2/Dreamcast. I assume this would require a decent video card.  I would also like to get rid of my Comcast cable box by means of a TV Tuner with a Cable Card. I’m also planning on getting some kind of remote or wireless keyboard, and a 360 controller to play games. I’m guessing this would be Bluetooth. I would also need some kind of Wi-Fi adapter/card. I would also like to access this PC from any TV in the house via roku boxes with PLEX.

So here I am, looking for suggestions on what parts to pick…

**CPU:** Needs to be powerful enough to run Wii/PS2 emulation, even if initially only used for SNES.

**MOBO:** Decent amount of expansion slots. (video card and tuner are planned upgrades), onboard 1080p output,  Ethernet, and decent audio.

**HDD:** looking for around 2TB to give me some room to grow my media collection. 

**PSU**: I have no idea how much power ill need to run this system, but needs to be upgrade friendly.

**RAM:** Im guessing 4-8 GB

**Case:**  Smaller the better, but obviously needs room for a future video card, tv tuner, multiple hard drives. Would also like to avoid overheating and noise. I’m not against a large case if by the end I get rid of all my consoles and dvr in the process. Would prefer front USB 3.0 slots for IR receiver / Bluetooth / wifi dongle

Anyone have any expirence building something similar? Ideas for parts? Any help would be appreciated.

I shutdown the sytstem.
I pulled the cablecard out of the I4 and then removed the I4 from my case and then powered back up my HTPC.
I plugged in the I6ETH and slid the cablecard in. The blue light blinked for a bit and then went solid. The I6ETH is plugged into a gigabit switch that my HTPC is also plugged into.
I then downloaded the latest version of the Ceton software for Windows 8 x64 and installed it without uninstalling the old version (this would cause problems for me later).
I then called Time Warner and gave them my old pairing info and then gave them the new pairing info. They had me pull up the device homepage and click on a few links to verify that everything paired up correctly. The call took about 10 minutes at most.
I then went into Windows Mediacenter and ran through the tv setup wizard and it found the new 6 tuner device and I was off and running.

I checked a few channels and then tried to upgrade the firmware on the I6ETH. I'd select the stable options and click the update button and the software would throw a .net error. I rebooted the computer a few times and then finally sent in a support ticket. I decided to uninstall the Ceton software, reboot and then I reinstalled the software and rebooted.

I build this a couple months ago but never took the time to post it...

I wanted a HTPC but I simply could not afford it.

Then one day my wife brought a [HP m8327c](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/ho/WF06b/12132708-12133156-12133158-12133158-12133158-81574412-81582502.html?dnr=1) from a co-worker to fix...
I found out that the GPU and the MOBO was dead and her co-worker told me to keep the PC for my troubles.

Looking around at work I found a old PC with a motherboard that match the previous computer 

This is what it looks like inside

* CPU: AMD X2 6000+                   Free
* Mobo: Gigabyte GA-M51GM-S2G   Free
* RAM: 4GB of DDR2                      Free
* HDs: 320GB x 2                         Free
* LAN: Gigabit LAN PCI card           Free
* Optical: DVD drive                     Free
* PSU: 500w                               Free
* GPU: Gforce GT 610                  17$
* Case: nMediaPC 5000b              69$
* HDPLEX IR Receive                   24$

For a total cost of little bit higher then hundred dollars.
The Case and the Remote are extras... but I think its not and HTPC if it doesn't look like one ;)

Run 1080p without and surprisingly does 3D as well
Not 100% silent but still pretty silent
Future Upgrade would be Bigger HDs and a better PSU then run it as a always on data server.

A6 is $50 at Microcenter, which is closeby. The Zalman I might not use if the standard AMD cooler is quiet enough and fits. The psythe shuriken was also an option. MOBO wise this one seemed to have the most features with HDMI as well, advice here would be great, I just did not want to cheap out on the MOBO. Power supply as well, I kind of do not know much about these, chose a semi modular one to have less cables. Optical drive doesn't really make a huge difference from what I have read; we never watch blurays. Read good things about the IOGEAR; even with the trackball problems seems to be a good choice. The case is for aesthetics mostly, but it seems pretty practical as well (maybe with the exception of the DVD drive bay limiting CPU cooler size).

OS will be windows 7 64 bit.

My father has a huge Jazz CD collection and likes to play them as opposed to burned FLACs or something (which I will put on the HDD anyway) so I decided to try out the HRT DAC, it's going to be hooked up to an amp and bookshelf speakers.

So people have been asking if I need read write access through Mac as well as a few other questions.   
I guess the goal here is to be flexible, I could just attach it to my Linux-box permanently and transfer everything over wifi and ethernet. This would defeat the purpose of the drive being external. I have little to no need to write from Mac OS, I doubt I would need to write from windows however reading from either or both would be ideal, Windows readability is far more preferable.

I am thinking I will go with NTFS, I am going to try formating my flash drive  to a few different tile types to see what file types work as read under windows, however NTFS is likely. Unless there is a way to keep it readable under windows and be good in linux.

Here's what I'd like to end up with.


Every TV able to access 

* Netflix
* Local Broadcast Stations
* Downloaded Video Files 

I already have Coax Run to each room, so I can use that if needed for local channels. (Install an Antenna where the Satellite used to be and reuse that Coax.)

I was thinking I should get 1 HTPC Server in a central location, and smaller devices of some sort in the other rooms. 

I'm perfectly fine if the server sits it's in the Living Room and doubles as my front end for that room, as long as it isn't loud. Size (Up to a typical desktop size) is not a problem. 

It needs to be able to 

* Run SABNZBD/CouchPotato/Sickbeard
* Have Enough Horsepower to feed content to all the other TVs in the house.


Nice to haves include

* Record Local TV
* Record Local Radio
* Old Game Emulation - If it's in the Living Room
* Same type of User Interface as the other TVs. (If it's in the living room)



So, What's my best option in this case?

Some of the ideas I have considered are - 

Plex + Roku Boxes

I Tried it before but it did not work very well at all... Probably because I had an old underpowered Windows Home Server trying to transcode and stream.

Windows Media Center + 360s as Extenders - Ends up getting Pricey with multiple TVs.

WDTV Boxes in each Room?

MediaPortal + &lt;Some sort of client&gt; in each room?

I've got at least 4 rooms other than the living room I would eventually like to feed content to.

The rub: The local cable provider is all digital encrypted so its a set-top on every tv.

I want it to do as much as possible, within the constraints of a budget of roughly £250/300 ($400/480).

I am not up2date with the latest hardware, it's been a while since I had to look at spec's, what is good and what isn't, hence why I am asking here. The mind boggles with all this stuff.

Side note; I can't afford a NAS so I'll be utilising either internal and/or external HD's to store my digital collection of SD/HD films. Right now, I do not need to stream content into multiple rooms.

I'm just curious what everyones home setup is?  I've gone through a lot of htpc setups over the past decade and my current one has been great!  My current setup is as follows:

Hardware  
QNAP TS-212 NAS (About $450 with 4TB of space)  
Apple TV2 (x2, $100 each)

Software  
nzbget and a modified nzbgetweb running on the QNAP device  
netflix on atv  
xbmc on atv  
custom nzbgetweb xmbc plugin

I've made modifications to nzbgetweb that will let you search nzbs.org for nzb's, then automatically begin downloading the nzb based on the nzb file it obtained from nzbs.org.  Once downloaded it will extract the movie/show to the appropriate location so that xbmc can add it to it's library.  I've also made an xbmc plugin to communicate with nzbgetweb and do this entire process from my apple tv remote so I no longer need to use a computer to get new movies.

Now with my setup I'm able to watch netflix from the apple tv or load up xbmc to download and watch movies/tv shows.  I'm thinking that I may now be able to replace my apple tv with a cheaper rasberry pi running android and have all of the same functionality with more potential for the device.

So what's your setup?  I've been trying to think of additional uses for a setup like this such as home security or maybe even a low cost smart home system.  Do setups like this even have a name? htpc seems a bit limited.  I'm also thinking of setting up some sort of site or board to allow people to post their setups so that other people can recreate them or post features that they'd want that other developers like myself may be able to create for them.  Does something like this exist already? or would you be willing to participate/contribute to this?

Anyways sorry for all the random questions and unloading, this has just been a bit of a hobby of mine for a while now and have found some additional free time lately to invest in it some more.

The set up wasn't that hard but i thought i would post some info here just in case anyone else was wanting to do a bit more with their remote control. you will need a remote and an IR sensor.

here is my remote http://i.imgur.com/YetzR.jpg 
it's pretty terrible, but it was free and it works.

My remote control worked fine in XBMC but did nothing at all elsewhere in windows. I wanted to be able to use it with spotify and also use it to start XBMC - they were my 2 main goals.


so, I read that the remote sends standard key presses to the pc (such as ctrl + shift + x) but these don't mean anything to windows so there are 2 things you need to do:

1: Work out what keys windows thinks are being pressed when you use certain buttons on the remote

2: Set up shortcuts, in windows to translate those key presses into useful actions.



To find out the key presses i used a program called showkey.exe
you can download it here http://xbmcmce.sourceforge.net/
Run the program and then point the remote at the sensor and press a few buttons. You will see that different key presses start coming through. make a note of all the key presses for the buttons you want to use as this will be needed later to set up the shortcuts. 
The commands appear as follows:
&lt;f mod=""ctrl,shift""&gt;Notification(Key, f, 3)&lt;/f&gt;
i didn't need all the info, just ""ctrl+shift+f""

now you will need to download the program to create the shortcuts. Autohotkey
http://www.autohotkey.com/
When you run this for the first time it will create a sort of tutorial script, i just used this and edited it with my own codes.
i got a list of the input codes from here: http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm
the main inputs were all at the top of that page. Ctrl, Alt, Shift and winkey (^, !, + and #)

These are the codes i used for the media commands (your inputs, on the left, may be different from mine! use the method above to find them)
;media
^+p::Send {Media_Play_Pause} 
^b::Send {Media_Prev}
^f::Send {Media_Next}
^+s::Send {Media_Stop}
^p::Send {Media_Play_Pause}

script for programs:
;programs
^e::run C:\Program Files (x86)\XBMC\XBMC.exe
^m::run C:\Users\******\AppData\Roaming\Spotify\spotify.exe

I'm using windows 8 so i also wanted a button to act as the windows key to get to the metro interface. There seemed to be some problems with this, it kept pressing the ctrl key as well as the win key. I think i could have used ctrl + esc but this seemed to work for me:
;other
&lt;^+t::
keywait ctrl
keywait shift
keywait t
send {LWin}
return

the key press on the remote is picked up as ctrl+shift+t - this script waits for the keypress, then waits for them all to be unpressed, then activates the win key. Probably not the best way but it works.

I also found that in windows 8 you can run metro apps from the cmd line. (try it press winkey+r for a run command - then type netflix:// -assuming you have it installed) there is a list of some of the apps here http://www.itsjustwhatever.com/2012/10/28/launch-windows-8-metro-apps-from-a-desktop-shortcut-or-command-line/

so anyway i wrote a line of script to run netflix
^i::run netflix://


After setting this all up you will want to put a shortcut to the script in your startup folder! that way you'll have it ready everytime your htpc boots up.
Amazingly, i couldn't work out how to do this at first on windows 8! everything seems to be a challenge. I sorted it though, get a run command and type shell:startup - there's the folder.

1351278607.0,8,self.htpc,124zen,[xpost] PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: Using a motherboard with RealTek sound and using a separate line/port to your subwoofer? Having problems with the bass? Or tired of plugging/unplugging your headset all the time? READ THIS.,12,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/124zen/xpost_public_service_announcement_using_a/,"So... I was very happy with my purchase of a T-amp and JBL Control One's. I had previously used a Creative I-trigue 2.1 system so I was prepared that my new system would need a a subwoofer. I figured why not keep the Creative sub, which I did. I understood that with two separate inputs (1 for old sub, now connected to sub port, and 1 for the new front speakers, connected to front port) I would need to find a solution if I was listening to normal stereo, since the sub is no longer connected to the front port, so I will not get any sound. Foobar delivered on the music front but as for video...no bass in movies. 

SURE, **Realtek offers two options if you install the Realtek HD Audio manager. ""Speaker fill"" and ""bass management"".** If you are not picky then use these. It will work, but the sound is distorted...low...with echoes. **Another option is to go to sound effects and choose ""room"" (which is the least echo-filled setting). You will get bass. With echoes.** Still not good. WHY NO CHOICE FOR JUST NORMAL BASS?!

**Well, after browsing the web, I finally found the solution to this and also solved the headset problem as well. I thought I should share. Here you go:**

1) Install Realtek HD Audio manager (if you haven't already).

2) Run regedit.

3) Go to the following location:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E96C-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}\0000\Settings\ and you will have something ending in DevType_0XXX_XXXXXXXX

4) Find the following for any port in use (PLUG IN THE STUFF YOU WANT TO USE!)

""Pin00"" = Rear Green-Coded ""FR FL"" jack, 

""Pin01"" = Rear black-coded ""RR RL"" jack

""Pin02"" = Center/Subwoofer
""Pin04"" = Mic-In

5) Check the codes. They define what a certain port (PIN) will be. 

""01 00 00 00"" = Mic-in
""02 00 00 00"" = headphones
""04 00 00 00"" = Front speakers
""05 00 00 00"" = Rear speakers
""06 00 00 00"" = Center/subwoofer
""07 00 00 00"" = Side speakers

6) Change or clone any port you want! Need a second front port for your headset? No problem! 

Example if i want ""Pin01"" = rear black-coded ""RR RL"" jack to be front speakers all i have to do is Pin01 - 04 00 00 00. 

7) Set your setup in HD audio manager to stereo (2 speakers).

8) Make sure that your speakers are marked as fullrange (if they are).

8) Restart the computer.

9) Enjoy nondistorted bass or a dedicated headset port. :D Your computer now behaves much like Win XP did. None of this messy Win7 bass business. 

In my case, I had an active subwoofer, meaning that I just cloned the front port to the port previously used for the rear speakers. Since my front speakers are full-range, I can connect them to one port, the bass to the other (which has its own crossover so it is really fullrange too) and now I don't need foobar. I get full undistorted bass all the time, and was even able to use the headset port on the old system control. :D Hell, I can even connect the old tweeters if I want. :D

I'm using my current PC to host my media/plex server and watch movies (mkv's) on my tv. It's okay for the most part but i'm having a few small issues that could be solved with a dedicated HTPC. 1. I'm running out of space so i need to expand and get more drives. Also another issue is my current CPU  (amd 1055t) i believe does not have what it takes to process 1080p mkv's using plex to send to phones/ipads. It kinda struggles transcoding. The latest build of plex server seems to have fixed it somewhat and it does seem to stream better now but some movies still skip and stutter. So the question
i ask is, do i build a super powerfull HTPC w/ i5 or even a i7 that can
handle transcoding 1080p on the fly or do I just go with a less powerfull chip, like a i3 which i don't know if it will be much better then my 1055t. 

The HTPC will be in my man cave w/ the home theater system 
and will do daily things like store all my movies/music/tv shows, XBMC,
usenet server probably w/ couch potato. Plex Server (transcoding to ipads and iphones, (sometimes transcoding to a phone while watching a MKV on the tv or boxee in another part of the house) massive storage, looking at around 6tb+ to start off.  It will need to be able to do passthrough over HDMI as my Reciever does DTS, DD, DTS-HD, DD-HD ect ect. I will also use it to stream UFC.tv which I use weekly when
UFC is on.  I'd like to keep it under $1000. No monitor needed, however I need something to control it. I have a extra ipad/itouch that could possibly be used and also a old harmony remote i currently use to control my other stuff. I'm not apposed to using a new device or if maybe the HTPC could control it.

I'm pricing out a budget HTPC and would love your feedback.

Mainly I'm looking for a build that will stream Netflix and other web content, watching blu rays and digital movies (in 1080p).  I'm a cord cutter and this will be our main source of entertainment.

Must haves for the build are HDMI out, and optical out for audio, blu ray reader.  Basically I'm a noob at building PCs so please let me know if there is anything I have left out or if there is a way for me to cut the costs anymore.

I was using a jailbroken apple tv2 before, and with the HTPC I was hoping to get rid of the apple tv2 - but it seems that unless I get a HDMI capable video card, I am better off just using the apple tv2 interface with the HTPC - unless I want to use the HTPC to play video games.

E350IA-E45 based HTPC/NAS solution in the living room, hooked up to TV.  I built it myself and it currently has 4TB of storage (more in the future) plus a small SSD for the OS. This is the main entertainment center and I keep all of my media content on this PC. It is very low power (18W idle) and it is a 24/7 seedbox as well. I run XBMC over top of Windows 7 for viewing on the TV, and I use basic folder sharing to make my media visible on the LAN. 

I have a gaming PC and I built my gf a desktop for her room, and both those machines can stream 1080p through VLC from the NAS with no buffering or  problems.

Now, I have an AppleTV2 with XBMC running in a bedroom with one wall of separation from the router, and additional wall of separation from the router to the NAS. The ATV2 cannot stream 1080p content without buffering every 5 minutes or less. 720p content usually will not buffer but sometimes it does. 

As for connection, I have a [Belkin router](http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Wireless-Dual-Band-Router-Generation/dp/B004N625AA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1339165344&amp;sr=8-1) that is attached to my main gaming PC in my bedroom. My fiber connection is 40Mbps/2Mbps and speedtest confirms. The router has to be in that room because that's where my fiber tap is for the apartment. For the ATV2 and my gf's pc, they both connect wirelessly from the next bedroom. My gaming PC is directly plugged into the router. Now the (potential) weak link of this is that I can't run ethernet from the router to my NAS in the living room. I have tried two different solutions - powerline networking (WD Live) and a wireless N usb receiver. The wireless N appears to be faster than the powerline networking from transfer speed tests I've run from all the computers. I don't have the transfer speed numbers but they looked high enough to be able to stream 1080p just fine.

So what is the reason why I can't stream 720/1080 from the NAS to the Apple TV without buffering? Where is my weakest link(s) right now? The wireless PC in the same room as the ATV can stream 1080 with no buffering, so is the ATV a potential weak spot as well?

Also, yes I am aware that the ATV2 cannot display 1080, but it can still downconvert my 1080p content to 720 for the plasma it's hooked to.",,False,self,t5_2rbfy,False,,,True,t3_urlug,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/urlug/how_can_i_speed_up_7201080_streaming_in_my/,

I've got an old microATX board and associated components I'd like to turn into an HTPC. It'll be almost an exact replica of my earlier PC, should be plenty for what I want (download and play media--simple!). 

What I need is a case, and I'm looking for slim (standing or on the side) with quiet a close second priority. I don't mind buying a replacement fan for quiet but I'd love an included power supply because I honestly don't need much power and don't want to deal with making sure a separate one fits. I've read lots of reviews about power supplies interfering with other internal components and would rather avoid those issues and save some money at the same time.

For reference, my existing components: 

* MSI G31M3 V2 microATX G31 chipset

* Intel Core2Quad chip (forget the speed, like 2.33GHz maybe?). 

* 2GB (2x1GB) Corsair DDR2 800MHz memory. Low profile.

* AX6450 (Radeon 6450) 1GBK3-SH card, also pretty low profile. Have to buy off a friend but I don't think that'll be a problem. Has the HDMI port I'd need that my old mobo doesn't offer.

* Some old CD/DVD player :)


Would have Windows7 from my university most likely. 

So feel free to comment on my current specs, and especially any recommendations on cases are appreciated!

Thanks

I am starting totally from scratch, with no TV in my room. But I need your help in deciding the details of the setup and picking the hardware itself.

**Priorities:** I'll start off with what my goals are. Here is a list of what I am looking for, in order of importance:

* Automated torrent downloading (I already know how to do this on utorrent)
* Automated usenet downloading (the tutorial above explains how to do this)
* Easy/seamless/smooth playback
* Organized browsing of movies/shows (I'm sure XBMC or Boxee will be fine for this)
* Access to and ability to play the downloaded music/shows/movies on my other laptops when at home
* Ability to browse the web on TV (GoogleTV style)

**Hardware:** This is what I am considering at the moment. (Obviously not planning on buying all of them, but I am trying to pick between these)

* Vizio 32"" LCD TV with 3xHDMI input ($350 from Costco. I am hoping this will be my biggest expense.)
* Acer Revo type of nettop computer with at least 250GB HD. (What should I be looking for in picking one? Is it possible to find one for under $200? Would it be possible to access the files on this machine from other devices on my network?)
* NAS (Is this desirable? Is it even necessary if I have a nettop box?)
* AppleTV2 (I know this can be JBed and made into a suitable XBMC platform, but is it possible to have it do automated downloads, etc?)
* Xbox360 (Obviously this can be used for XBMC, but can it download/store media as effectively as a pc?)
* MacMini (This sounds like a great idea, but would obviously be expensive)
* LG GoogleTV box


**Given my priorities and options, how should I set up my network/server/HTPC keeping in mind that I want to keep costs to a minimum?**

I haven't speced and built a PC for a few years so I figured I would get some advice before I start my research.  


From what I understand the gaming will be the more intensive use as Plex is pretty darn efficient.  Should I look at an I3/5 build with a decent graphics card or look at the AMD options with integrated graphics?  Goals are to be able to direct play full HD movie content and play most games at 1080P and output everything over HDMI to my receiver.


I want to keep this pretty small, and will run a SSD and traditional hard drive for local storage.  Everything else will be stored on my plex server upstairs.  I still have to define my budget, but I was thinking less than $800, with $600 being awesome but maybe not realistic.  Any advice you can give to point me in the right direction would be great!

One minor problem.,7,0,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1k2ero/virtualized_a_htpc_one_minor_problem/,"So after wanting a HTPC to use with my new TV I bought, I spent a few days pricing out various HTPC's with different cases, motherboards, etc. Then it dawned on me, a Virtual Machine. My host machine is already quite powerful, why not spread out what I don't use?

**What I did:**
I currently have dual monitors for my main rig (Ivy bridge i5, 16GB RAM, GTX 670) I also have a TV that I recently purchased.

So far I have successfully connected the 3rd display (TV) to the PC, moved the VM window to TV, set the VM to only use the HDMI out audio, and to set it to full screen.

I have also got a wireless keyboard (w/ track pad) that is dedicated to this VM.

Essentially I got a HTPC for about $15 (and surprisingly it works amazingly. Emulators up to PS2 work and can play SF4:AA @ 1080p), all I needed was a long HDMI cable. Much cheaper than an entirely new PC.

**The problem:**
The only minor minor issue is, the host can still move the mouse to the 3rd monitor and onto the guest OS. Not really an issue for me, but for another user on this computer. I do not want it disturbing the guest OS. I would prefer it if I can somehow lock the host OS to the first two monitors.

I know there were programs to do this when dual monitors became more popular (lock mouse to first monitor for gaming), but what about triple monitors?

Would anyone know of a tool or program that can do this?

I am sure someone out there may have a similar setup. Just looking for suggestions.

I had a Core 2 Quad PC that used to serve all but the cablecard duties, but that has since been turned into a server.

As far as hardware goes, I have an AMD 6850 from my gaming PC that has been replaced. Would you guys recommend selling it and going with an AMD A10 build with some nice 1866 MHz RAM, or going with a Pentuim or i3 system and using the card? My main concern is if the AMD A10 or Intel Pentium or i3 is capable of recording streams from the cable card at the same time as either watching a Twitch.tv stream or playing LoL. For gaming, it would be me playing on it and I don't care about quality--the absolute lowest settings at 1080p would be fine with me, which I think the 6850 would be overkill for. For Twitch, I'd like to be able to watch the stream at 1080p if that particular channel offers that option.

One is the [ZBox nano AD12](http://www.zotac.com/products/mini-pcs/zbox-nano-series/product/zbox-nano-series/detail/zbox-nano-ad12.html) (AMD) and the other is the [ZBOX ID88](http://www.zotac.com/products/mini-pcs/zbox/intel/product/intel/detail/zbox-id88-2.html) (Intel).

I don't have too much experience with this, so I just wanted to consult the rest of you and see what would the best for my set up. I'm still interested in building my own (it probably won't be as small), for under 500$.  If anyone had any suggestions for custom builds, I'd greatly appreciate it.

I am trying to build a NAS but I want to make sure I have the most energy efficient parts but still have enough power to run everything. I already have a case and Orion HP585D power supply. I'm planning on adding two more 3TB harddrives in the future.

I plan on using the NAS to stream movies for multiple computers throughout the house so there might be about 2-4 computers streaming at a time. Most files will be bluray quality movies/shows. I also want to use PLEX to view the files from outside my home. Will this PC be able to handle it? Are the parts good enough or should I upgrade something or even cut back something to make the price cheaper? Also do you think a NAS will be able to handle the workload that I plan on giving it? Would the network be the choke point or the hardware?

My primary concern with this build was size. My entertainment center is only about 12 inches deep, so it was a huge pain to find a case that would fit. Almost all HTPC cases are 14-17 inches deep.

I already had the processor, ram, graphics card, keyboard, and harddrive, so all I bought was the motherboard, case, and wireless adapter.

I'm really hoping the 300 watt psu in the case is enough to power the 7850, but if it isn't I will either upgrade it or drop down to a 6570. Any thoughts, critiques, suggestions you guys have would be great! Thanks :)

UPDATE: The build went successfully. The case is fantastic. There really isn't any documentation with it, but it doesn't take a genius to figure it out. The 300 watt psu powers everything fine.

my first thought was that the motherboard is fried. before i start replacing parts all willy-nilly, does that sound about right?

it may be worth nothing that i recently moved my receiver closer to the htpc case in an effort to neaten things up in that room. i'm thinking that may have been a bad decision. 

also, for those wondering, i put my htpc in a micro atx case to keep things cheaper and easier. the htpc is in the living room and the tv is in the family room connected via 25' hdmi.

I leave the HTPC on 24x7 with no power management enabled.  7MC runs in full-screen mode and when I'm done watching TV, I just stop live TV and get it back to the main menu before powering off the TV and receiver.

Newer drivers seem to resolve the ""crappy resolution on power on"" bit, but those channels that previously occasionally flickered (as well as a bunch that didn't) will show a Display Driver Error screen (The video playback device does not support playback of protected content)

Any suggestions on anything are greatly appreciated or if you can see any glaring flaws!

Is the AMD cpu's integrated graphics decent enough for what I am looking to do?

Also, should I get a graphics card for the machine, and if so any suggestions.

Thanks in advance!

UPDATE : Seeing as how I am from Canada, did not really thing of this in advance I have to go around looking for the parts now on the .ca version :)

I am actually getting the AMD A10-5800K from the Canadian version of Newegg for like $15 cheaper then the 5700 on the .com version.

**Other thoughts** 

* I could save some money on the chassis, but those Lian-Li aluminum chassis are really nice looking and I need something that'll look at home next to my tv.  
* I should probably buy a higher quality power supply than the one included with the chassis but I think I'm going to initially take my chances, there are some nice micro-itx 230w PSU's on the market if I need to do that.   
* I've been really frustrated by the lack of micro-itx AMD motherboards, the ASRock seemed to be the least of all evils, but I'd love to see a nice ASUS board show up in the market.  
* My SSD is small, but I'll likely be using and external hard drive I have for any large video files or whatever.
* I have little experience with linux, but I'm hoping it'll be a good experience, if anyone has some input there that'd be helpful.
* This system needs to be as quiet as possible, the only moving parts this build should have will be the cpu heatsink (AMD OEM) and the PSU fan.  If the cpu heatsink is noisy I may switch to one of the fan-less heatsinks that are on the market.  If the PSU is noisy I'll throw some money at a new one.  Hopefully it's cool n' quiet as is. 

Thanks for checking out my new pride and joy in the making, any tips are appreciated!

Trying to get some opinions on a new build.  I'd like to keep the budget around $400 or so, but can spend more if needed.

I already have a 120gb Kingston SSD, a copy of Windows, and both an internal tuner card and an HDHR.  I also have a few external hard drives for storage.

I'll be running the computer pretty much 24/7 running newznab, sick beard, and Plex Media Server.  I'm not currently using the tuner cards, since my cable provider has decided not to offer the locals in HD any more, but I might be moving to a place that will have good OTA reception, so that will be coming back into the picture at some point.

I'd also like to play a little Guild Wars 2 and some Dolphin emulation at acceptable frame rates.

In the future, I am thinking about adding a 3TB internal drive and using the Storage Spaces feature in Windows 8 to pool my internal/external drives.

How's this look?

The biggest requirement is certainly being able to run Dolphin. As for CPU does an i3 suffice? Or would an i5 be better?

I'm more or less at a loss for the graphics card. I would like a power-efficient one that doesn't consume too much power while it's not used for gaming and it should not be too big so I can use a smaller case. Any suggestions?

I was thinking to go with a 3x3TB RAID 5 setup. Any thoughts on that?

I would like to be able to turn on the machine with a remote, however if this is not feasible with the available boards than I could fall back to using WOL.

I'm pretty new to HTPCs so I'm a bit worried about the GFX card not fitting the case and picking the right PSU for good efficiency and noise levels for low load. What kind of power consumption can be expected with such a build (standby, idle, max)?

On the software side I'm probably required to use Windows because of Dolphin, a dual boot solution with a Linux such as XBMCUbuntu or or similar as default might also be an option for me though. In such a case, could an integrated GFX card be used on Linux while the main card would only be turned on on Windows for better efficiency?

Edit: I'm currently looking at this setup:

I have everything except a tuner card.  Right now I have Directv who's subscription will be up in May, so I'm considering cancelling and cutting the cord. The main issue with cutting the cord is ease of use for the fiance and kids. 

I plan on running Win7 x64 with either Plex or XBMC with a AMD PHENOM II X6 1045T 8GB Ram and a 128GB Solid State Drive connected to 50"" LG Plasma via HDMI. There is also a NAS device that contains most of the content that I watch.

If I cancel DTV I will put up an antenna. I have done this in the past from a location nearby and am able to receive all of the local networks. This may satisfy the fiance since she will be able to watch her reality shows as long as she can record one while watching another. I think I can also satisfy the kids with options other the DTV programming.

Question is what card works best for this?  I am looking at the Hauppauge 1213 WinTV-HVR-2250 PCI-E x1 Dual TV Tuner. Once it's set up though, will there be a simple menu to access everything? Will we be using the Plex or Xbmc interface to access both the stored content and the OTA guide or would we need to use the cards OTA interface for broadcast TV then Plex/XBMC for the stored content? Basically, I'm looking for something that mimics a standard cable/OTA interface as much as possible.

Help me figure out what to do,10,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/15yqpy/amd_fm2_miniitx_mobo_issues_help_me_figure_out/,"so I purchased components for an HTPC a little over a month ago. Initially, I was using an AMD A6-5400k and the ASRock FM2A75 MoBo... That MoBo has since crapped out (the entire model has been having power regulation issues, thankfully mine didn't set on fire like some other people).

So now that leaves only one other Mini-ITX FM2 board out there, the MSI. Problem is, the MSI is sold out everywhere, and I just got off the phone with the manufacturer and they're on extremely short supply.  They said they MIGHT have 10 of them at the end of this month, but didn't know where they would get distributed and it seems increasingly probably that it will be extremely difficult to get my hands on one of these boards.

I've been able to locate a Zotac FM2 Mini-ITX board that will work.  The only issue is that its based on the A55 chipset and not the A75 chipset.  The only concern I have is whether or not I will see a meaningful decrease in performance only getting SATA2 out of the A55 board, versus SATA3 out of the A75 (my SSD is SATA3).  I'm going to be using the machine primarily for viewing video in XBMC, some light web browsing, and maybe a little gaming through Steam's Big Picture (with graphic settings understanding the limitations of my CPU of course).  Do you think the A55 chipset will be fine for my purposes? I'm less concerned with the native USB 3 support as the Zotac board has 2 USB 3 ports on it and I don't plan to have many USB 3 peripherals connected to it.  Are the Zotac boards considered on par with the other manufacturers? 

TL;DR Should I hold out and get the MSI A75 board or just get the Zotac board now. I'm getting pretty restless sitting on all these components. ",,False,self,t5_2rbfy,False,,,True,t3_15yqpy,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/15yqpy/amd_fm2_miniitx_mobo_issues_help_me_figure_out/,

The build is loosely based on the mymediaexperience guide, which I found fantastic, but I just want know I'm in the 'sweet spot' where I've got the power to run high quality video and leave myself open to future upgrades (BD Drive, maybe a small GPU) without spending too much money.

I'm skipping an optical drive since I don't need one at the moment, and don't think I need a GPU out of the gate with Intel 3000 graphics. Any thoughts on this setup? I don't want to get laggy 1080p playback, but I also don't want to overspend too much.

Additional question: do I have to buy SATA cables, fans, and Arctic Silver etc in addition to the above as well? I have a power and HDMI cable for the box, but it's unclear on newegg whether HDDs and mobos come with the smaller peripherals. 

EDIT: Thanks so much for all the help. After taking advice from this thread, I think the following is much more appropriate for what I'm looking for. All in all, it's cheaper as well which is a plus. Again, comments are always appreciated.

Firstly, I'm hoping this is the best place to post this - however, if you know of another reddit forum that may be better, please let me know and I'll bugger off :P

Okay. I currently have a ReadyNAS Ultra 2, with 2x1TB hard drives - It runs SABnzbd, Sickbeard and Couchpotato all very well. I currently don't have a main piece of hardware to use for XBMC - I currently run it on my Macbook Pro.

What I'd like to do is combine the two into one piece of kit. I'd like to have a box under the TV which will do the following:

* It will run 24/7 in my bedroom (So preferably low power and must be very quiet)
* It will run XBMC continuously (So all I'd have to do is change the TV output to the correct HDMI port and we're sorted) (It will also have to run 720/1080p videos, and the interface should be nice a speedy, and be able to run skins such as Aeon and other add ons)
* It will need to run SABnzbd, Sickbeard &amp; Couchpotato continuously
* I would like to be able to host a small ""Coming Soon"" page for a upcoming project of mine which will receive very low traffic (However, I would be interested in maybe using it for when the site is fully online - but this is not a deal breaker, I will more than likely buy  a hosting package)
* I'd like to be able to remotely access the content on the server from, for example, an iPad or a laptop (I'd also like the ability to control SABnzbd, Sickbeard and Couchpotato remotely)
* Should be able to hold 4 hard drives

Not asking for much am I? :P

So my question is - Is there an already built server/HTPC that would be able to handle the above? Or should I be building one myself? I have built a few computers in the past, so that wouldn't be a problem - The software side of things might be though, as I haven't got *much* experience with regards to running a server-like piece of hardware. But I'm willing to learn :)

So basically -- Any advice would be much appreciated :)

Since I'm renting this house, I'm not able to do any sort of work with hard-wiring in cat5/6. My main goals are playing high quality 1080p/5.1 files on my TV (either ps3ms doesn't cut it, or maybe its my wifi that's bottlenecking), and allowing playback on my main PC as well. My principal concerns at this time are cost, and ability to scale upwards in the future (adding things like PVR, live tv, backup, bluetooth/IR remote, etc.). I have experience with building PCs, so I'd like to go that route. There are three potential directions I'm investigating, and I'm not sure which best fits my needs:

* Build a ~$300 HTPC only unit, use my main PC as my always-on server, and then tackle the network speeds one of two ways: invest in a better wireless router, or try the Ethernet over Power solutions. This seems like the most likely option for me, and once I'm able to afford it, I can transition towards a dedicated media server solution later.

* Build a HTPC + Media server box in one. This will allow me to have media playback on my TV off the bat, and I can work towards the network speed issues later on. The downside here is that the actual unit will have to be quite large to house my hard drives, and the unit will always have to be on.

* Build seperate server and HTPC, and just bite the bullet. I can put both boxes in the living room, solving my TV problem, and again tackle getting media to my PC at a later time. This is the style of solution I want to do now, but I'm not sure I can afford two cases, two mobos, two CPUs, two power supplies right now. 

How would you tackle this problem? Should I just postpone this project and focus instead on improving my network speeds to get PS3MS running well? The problem is that it's really ugly, and clunky, slow start up, horrible play/pause/stop/seek, and I don't want to spend a ton of time/effort tweaking and improving a solution that I know is going to be temporary.",,False,self,t5_2rbfy,False,,,True,t3_1440oy,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1440oy/help_me_solidify_my_htpc_solution_goals_into_a/,

The Revo seems like a good choice for me - it's compact, relatively cheap, and seems to support the uses I had in mind (playback of Netflix, Hulu, internet content, and media from local files). I've done some searching here and on /r/cordcutters, and it seems like the Acer Revo's were really popular about a year ago and then the hype died down. I haven't seen many posts about it anymore.

Also, everyone seems to talk about the Revo AR3700 but it looks like it's not available anymore. The models I have found are:

[RL70-UR308](http://www.amazon.com/Acer-RL70-UR308-Desktop-Black/dp/B009QVQQ5C/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353445641&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=acer+revo#productDetails)

[RL70-UR21P](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883103468)

They all seem pretty comparable, but I'm leaning toward the UR308 due to the cheapest price and includes Windows 8 (64bit right?).

I'm looking for any enlightenment from you folks about any recommendations between the Revo models, or if I'd be making a serious mistake buying it. I thought it was a little suspicious that no one on here really talks about them anymore.

I've also been considering the build from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/112qbs/acer_revo_3700_vs_home_built/c6iu3m2) but the cost for Windows 8 will probably make it a lot more expensive.

My goal here is to have something that acts as a network file sever, potentially a file server for when I'm out of the house, a torrent box (hopefully automated), a media pc (hulu, netflix, south park studios, downloads), and a light gaming machine.

The price is actually about $60 lower than the pcpartpicker list due to some cheaper prices on the SSD and case that partpicker doesn't seem to know about.

I'm fairly confident that this thing will get the job done, I just don't know what to expect as far as noise and heat. I also don't know if I will really save that much cash by waiting until Black Friday. What are your thoughts on the build and on potential cyber monday savings?

* NAS &amp; HTPC in one
* Stream Audio &amp; Video from HDD directly to attached TV as well as networked devices (tablet/TV/desktop) in 1080p
* Record TV to HDD and ""relay"" TV signal to other devices in the house (mostly tablet and another TV)

Parts i had a look at so far:

    Streacom FC10 Fanless Chassis (+ Streaflex 250 PSU)
    ASRock Z77 Pro4
    Intel Core i3-3225
    G.Skill 4GB PC3-12800U CL9-9-9-24 (DDR3-1600)

If i get a Twin Tuner Card ( http://shop.digital-devices.de/epages/62357162.sf/en_GB/?ViewObjectID=31109998 ):

1. Can I watch one TV channel on the TV directly attached to the HTPC (via HDMI) and stream a different channel to a tablet (via WLAN and easyVDR/streamdev or similar software)? 
Is 4 GB RAM sufficient and the i3 powerful enough for this?

1. How about streaming a TV channel to one device, recording a different channel and streaming full HD (e.g. to a desktop computer) at the same time?

1. To ""relay"" the TV channels and media to another TV in the house this TV would need some kind of ""receiving"" htpc of their own i guess?

Also im quite confused as to which mainboard to choose for this setup, there seem to be many different versions available, whereas the actual differences seem to be marginal.

Thanks for any help.

The system noise isn't terrible, but I think this is a situation where I want my cake and to it eat it as well.  In other words, I don't think I can get as quiet as I would like without sacrificing  performance, but I really want to try.

First off, my primary purpose for this rig was to be able to play current games at high quality, thinking that a machine that is sufficiently powerful to do the above will also be suffciently powerful for HTPC duties.  I know the configuration is overkill for HTPC, what I am trying to do now is simply quiet the machine down somewhat.  

Here are the specs:

* Case - Silverstone CW02
* Mobo - ASRock Extreme4 Z77
* CPU - i5 3570k 
* RAM - 32GB G.Skill 1866 (4 DIMMS)
* Storage1: RAID 0 (OS and apps) - 2x 240GB Mushkin Chronos Deluxe
* Content storage - 2TB WD Caviar Black 7200RPM
* Video - EVGA GTX 680 Superclocked Sig 2
* Tuner Card - Ceton Infinitv 4
* ODD - LG BluRay burner
* PSU - ThermalTake 850W Black Widow (140mm ball bearing fan)

* Cooling:
* CPU Cooler - Deepcool Assassin twin tower 8 heatpipe design with 140mm and 120mm fans
* Case: Intake: 2x Silenx 92mm intake fans mounted to baseplate of case drawing in air from vented panel the case sits on
* Exhaust (CPU): Gentle Typhoon 120mm mounted aft of CPU cooler
* Exhaust (PCI): Modified 140mm PCI cooler slot taken from my Lian Li PC2110b rig and modfied to fit the Silverstone chassis.  Fan is an NZXT, not sure model number


[imgur link to pics](http://imgur.com/a/xif2v)

Not sure how, but it looks like I accidentally uploaded the pics twice, sorry for the duplicated images in that gallery.



The chassis lives in a BDI Avion 2 entertainment stand which has a slotted undertray that allows components to draw in fresh air from beneath and exhaust out the back of the stand.  There is also a oak door with glass windows between the rig and the user.


I haven't overclocked the CPU at all yet, and I was wondering what the group thought of potentially underclocking it and ditching one, or both of the fans on the large CPU heatsink, and just relying on the Gentle typhoon exhaust fan to get airflow across the heatsink?  I am also thinking about ditching the PCI slot fan, but I read that the Ceton card can get hot, and of the GTX680 is going to generate some heat as well.  


I am going to move forward as follows:

* Remove 1 CPU cooler fan, no change to CPU clocks, test thermals/noise
* If still too noisy, remove second CPU cooler fan, test thermals/noise
* If still too noisy, remove PCI Cooling fan, test thermals during gameplay

Does anyone else have any other suggestions?  Liquid cooling is probably not an option, but I might consider something like one of the all-in-one kits Corsair makes. 

Thanks for reading.

A little background: I love AV gear.  I've been in the industry for 4 years,first in retail now as a sales rep for an importer/wholesaler.  Over the years I've built up a reasonable home theatre system and I wanted to build an HTPC to match.  I did have my 5 year old tower doing duty as an HTPC but it was pretty ugly and was struggling with 1080p content.  I figured it was time to get a much nicer case (to suit the rest of my gear) and upgrade the parts.  Plus I was just itching to put something together.  

Everything's going well now, but I can't get Wake-On-Lan to work.  I can't find anything in the BIOS referring to WOL so I hope it has the ability.

I'm building a HTPC that will fit in a Nintendo 64. Yeah, it's been done, but I loved the look and ~~want~~ need one.

So I have the N64 gutted. I have a SSD ordered for it. And I like the sound of the all in one Zotac boards, specifically [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813500065&amp;name=Motherboard-CPU-VGA-Combo) one.

Everything that I think I would need is there, even power. Any negatives to this plan? I would add RAM obviously. 

This box will mainly take over duties that my jailbroken Apple TV is doing. Running XBMC for the most part. Except I would add in some emulators. All content will be streamed from the net or my NAS.

The only thing I wish I could add in would be some sort of DVR functionality so I could pipe my cable through it. Without room for a TV Tuner card I'm not sure how I could do it.

I plan on running XBMC off a flash drive (XBMCbuntu or something similar) and streaming my TV shows and movies from my 2TB drive in my main computer. I may buy a HDD for the HTPC but for now I don't want any internal storage to help keep energy use down and cost down.

 While I wouldn't mind building one from scratch, I have been looking at premade models. What catches my eye is the Assassin HTPC Extender Basic. I am wanting to keep the cost as low as possible while being able to provide everything I need. I do not need a HDD as I will be streaming (using a wired connection) from my main computer and have no need for it to play discs (DVD, blu-ray, etc) as I have a PS3 for that.

So could someone give me advice on the best, cheapest way to go about what I am wanting to accomplish?",,False,self,t5_2rbfy,False,,,True,t3_wvhzj,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/wvhzj/wanting_a_htpc/,

so first off, and I don't want to sound like a snob or anything, but no Apple TVs. They're pretty expensive 'round my parts. Also, not from the US/Canada so newegg/tigerdirect and other online stores aren't going to work for me either. so is craigslist. well there is a craigslist in my area but it's no good.

Generally just want to play downloaded videos/anime in a bigger screen. Thing is, the TV is pretty old with just [RCA](http://www.adorama.com/images/product/APRYW6FT.JPG) and [coax](http://www.sciencephoto.com/image/107545/530wm/C0043333-Coaxial_connector_connecti) connection. I was hoping to have it function as a torrent box as well.

Any input would be appreciated. I just can't really decide...

**Media Player**

[MediaGate MG-35 - Mediagate USA](http://www.mediagateusa.com/html/mg35ndas.html)

PROs 

- I can get it cheap. (used)
- can get it with an HDD in it already, plus use mine if needed
- connections are there without  having to wreck my head
- pretty small, the size of a WD My Book...
- can be accessed in the network, how easy is still in question
- will only need to shell out about 45 USD

CONs

- it's used, with no warranty
- how am I supposed to fix it if it's broken?
- may not be able to play soft subs, seller says it plays it though, 
- there are various video file types out there, may not be able to play all that I can throw at it.

**Making my own (HT)PC**

Will be making it with older parts, plus will be purchasing some others.

already have: socket 478 Celeron D 2.26 | [Motherboard](http://www.msi.com/product/mb/945GCM5-L-V2.html) | HDD

will be needing: RAM | Case w PSU | Videocard | DVD Drive (?) | Converter

PROs

- will be able to play pretty much anything I want
- can be used as a torrent box. network sharing also a breeze
- easy upgrade if needed. moar HDD space
- easy repairs if needed

CONs

- it'll be huge. i'll be using a slim tower and even though it's particularly smaller than my own PC, it's still not that portable.

- going to be a bit more expensive, 70-90 USD

- I've researched, getting an RCA connection in a computer to connect to a TV isn't as easy as it used to be. [Will be needing an external device that will convert vga to rca](http://www.vetac.com/UploadFiles/20111221155137674.jpg) (that's why the cost increased) and the video quality they say isn't that great

Thoughts?,7,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/qdkvt/thinking_about_upgrading_4yr_old_system_to/,"My computer was a fine mid range gaming machine in its day, but for the past few years it's been a combo server/htpc in the living room. Now I'm thinking about upgrading and splitting those duties into separate machines. 

I think that I could get by with upgrading the innards of the machine (mobo, processor, RAM) to act as the server, or I could go with something like an HP Micro Server ([this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16859107052)). 


My current machine is as follows:

* Asus P5Q Mobo
* E8400 C2D Intel processor
* 4gb DDR2 800 RAM
* GeForce 8800 GT Video Card (I'd take this out of a server)
* 500GB Seagate HDD
* 2x2TB WD drives
* Antec 900 case

Any advantage to scrapping that and getting the micro server? On the HTPC side I haven't decided yet, but I'd probably go with some kind of low power i3 setup.

My main concerns are power consumption, being able to handle 1080p video to the TV on the HTPC side, and being able to run SABnzbd/couch potato/sickbeard on the server side

Thanks for any input.

Some superduper case. All this is overkill for an HTPC but I just couldn't resist. All for $400 obo. He agreed to $360. He was looking for quick cash in order to buy a gun at a gunshow the next day.

Then Ceton lowered the price of their Quadtuner to $199. Awesome. Anyway I should receive the tuner today and I already have my fios cablecard. Plex is installed and running.

Minor issues: The VFD on the X11 case doesn't work which is no big deal, and one of the raptors is starting to make a lot of noise. I plan on replacing that with an SSD. It's also cramped and I'm worried about proper (silent) cooling.

I'm trying to keep it absolutely as cheap as possible while still getting the job done RIGHT. If it's laggy, chunking, or can't stream HD smoothly then I'm not happy. 


Here's what I'm looking for:

1) MUST support 1080p or higher.

2) Look nice and hopefully small (not like a desktop)

3) Cheap as possible.

4) Hopefully silent, but at very least quiet.

I don't know if it needs a Hard Drive or not. I have a file server with all my movies on it and I was thinking I'd just use a usb memory stick with a small OS on it. Please tell me if this is a terrible idea though :-)

So, from top to bottom, please suggest the hardware you'd put in a box like this. Links would be appreciated.

Thanks!

I'm working as a bit of an assistant editor and my boss has given me a side job that I'm a bit out of my element on. He has a massive hard drive with a host of HD movies that have been acquired through various sources... Most of these are in MKV containers but he wants to convert them into a file format that will play nice with Final Cut Pro (essentially .mov files), with a minimal loss in quality while shrinking the file size at least a bit. I understand that it's impossible to compress without introducing some fidelity loss, but I was hoping someone could recommend a good ""set it and forget it"" workflow so that I can start this process.

My (perhaps naive) thought is to run the files through handbreak into smaller m4v files and then transcode through Compressor, but I'm a bit foggy on which would be the best settings on either of these programs and not even sure if that is introducing too many problems along the way.

Additionally, while most of these MKV. files are ~7-8 gigs, I recently ripped a Blu-ray to this drive (as an MKV.) and it clocked in at close to 30 gigs (even after stripping out bonus footage and extra audio tracks). How can I shrink these massive Blu-ray files down to 7-8 gigs while keeping things looking nice? Or, alternatively, what did I do wrong when initially ripping the Blu-ray?

Given that I've managed to accrue a pretty substantial collection of programs related to this task, I'm hoping I don't need to download anything else, but here is what I'm working with:

* Quicktime 7 Pro

* Compressor

* Handbreak

* MPEG Streamclip 

* MKVToolnix

* Make MKV (this is what I used to rip the Blu-ray that ended up as a 30 gig file)

* MP4 Tools

Finally, someone is going to have to kind of walk me through whatever process you recommend. I understand the concept behind muxing and I imagine that will have to be a step in this workflow, but can someone explain why? That's the part I keep getting a bit confused by....

She enjoys being able to watch everything and have all of the capabilities but she complains that its too complicated to use and that to use one service she has to swap devices and remotes *(I had a good Harmony remote but I cant find the cable anywhere to update the remote to my newer devices and setup)*.  I can live with this setup but, admittedly, I'd enjoy something a bit cleaner looking.

So, in order to simplify our setup and make things a bit easier to learn and control for her, I'd like to build a good mid-range HTPC and move our blu-ray player and mac-mini back to my office area (for storage if nothing else).  I'd like to keep costs under $500 and prefer to use a Windows OS (again, for simplicity in case she ever has to trouble-shoot anything while I'm not at home).  I'm looking for this HTPC to be able to stream Hulu, Netflix, HBO GO, Showtime Anytime, Amazon Prime, Spotify, play Blu-Ray and DVDs, play some games on Steam (some controller friendly games on medium to high graphics settings), and play whatever emulators I have running (mostly my NES, SNES, and Genesis).  The ability to play Steam games is the least important of these as I already have a custom built pc in my office that can handle my games but it would be nice to be able to introduce her to a few of them and let her have the ease of learning the xbox controller over a keyboard/mouse setup.

The only other thing I'm really looking for in this whole setup is a remote control that will work nicely with XBMC and that has a keyboard (qwerty, I'd hope) for entering information instead of having to leave my wireless keyboard out on the table.

I want to build a HTPC that can run XBMC and Emulators for old systems now and that can evolve into a half decent gaming machine.

I already own the Nvidia GT 430 and 2TB drive and will use them.

I want the case, power supply, motherboard and SSD drive to last me a long time. The CPU will eventually be upgraded to a i5 so I'm buying the cheapest LGA1155 Ivy Bridge CPU I could find. I'll add RAM and a better video card in the future as well.

I considered doing a AMD APU build but I would have to spend more now and I don't like the long term potential of such a build.

I realise I'm putting a lot of money in the SSD but it should last me a very long time.

I would like the system to be as silent as possible. Should I buy another CPU fan? I know many people like this case, what do you guys think?

Edit: I think this case only supports low profile cards. What performance can I expect from ""high end"" low profile video cards? Should I go for a bigger HTPC case?

------------------------ 04/08/2013 Update -----------------------------------------------

I updated my planned build a bit and bought a SSD and OS already

I found a Silverstone ML03B case review and build insructions that specifically suggested this power supply for this case so I'll go with the 500W version because that's what DirectCanada sells.
http://pcgamingcorner.com/wordpress/?p=3190

I also learned that a 140mm depth modular power supply is too big for this case if I wanted to install an optical drive because the connectors on the modular power supply stick out. If you want both a 140mm depth power supply and an optical drive, you have to get a non modular one.

I don't plan on putting an optical drive but the option to do it will be nice. And for the build without optical drive, I can just stuff the extra cables in the optical drive bay.

I bought the Samsung 840 SSD 120GB for a good price. I'm saving $50 compared to the Pro version and the slower write speed should still be more than sufficient.

I found out that Ivy Bridge CPUs require 1.5v DDR3 RAM. (my previous pick was 1.65v) I increased to 2x4GB so I would have more than enough and I think the value is good there.

These case fans not too expensive and are supposed to be very quiet. Is Enermax a good brand?

I can pick up a Core 2 Duo system with 2GB of RAM for around $150ish, and HDHomeruns or Ceton InfiniTVs are pretty cheap on eBay. I have hard drives already that I can repurpose. I have FiOS, if it matters. One of our STBs is free, so I'd keep that and send back the DVR and the other STB. I have a PS3 which I could stream TV to using DLNA or I could sell it and get a 360 to use with WMC.

Assuming the computer is powerful enough, it sounds like I could have an HTPC for around $300 or so, maybe closer to $400 after some extra RAM and remotes and stuff. It's clearly not super high end, but would this be enough to just replace the basic FiOS DVR I have now? I have a 10 year old TV that I won't replace anytime soon, so I don't necessarily need 1080p right now. I'm just basically trying to stop paying the ridiculous fee for the DVR.

Front end media stuff

 * Windows Media Center loaded up with media, single tv tuner card on broadcast tv
 * Steam with a bunch of Big picture mode ready games
 * Also have connected the tablet youtube app to youtube.tv

Back end controls and other fancy bits

 * AutoRemote connected to EventGhost
 * BitTorrent talking to DropBox for incoming torrents
 * xPadder running to move around in WMC with the xbox controller...it works but its kinda clunky still

Stuff I've thought about doing with all this

 * Find a way to gracefully go from WMC to Steam to YouTube.tv to whatever else
 * Standardize all the controls, I've got a phone, tablet, KB+M, and the xbox controller, they all can interface differently, I'd like to make it so they are all useful, in a perfect world I don't want to have to grab a mouse and keyboard to do anything unless I absolutely must

Specs:

* ASUS P5GC-MX/1333
* Core 2 Duo E4500
* 3.5GB RAM (it has a 2x2 kit but the BIOS only counts to 3456... far as I can tell it's a BIOS limitation related to integrated graphics)
* GeForce GTX 470
* 40GB HDD (doesn't need much... I have 2TB of RAID5 in my server upstairs, connected via gigE)
* DVD-RW (using as only a -ROM for now)
* Ubuntu 12.04.2 x86_64 custom

It's connected (via HDMI) to a circa-2005 Sony SXRD projection TV, overscan-compensated with a custom modeline. (Effectively 1772x999i. Blech.) For audio, it's connected to a Logitech Z-5500 box system via 3x3.5mm analog.

At this point:

* gotten XBMC running at boot, and connected to network shares
* Steam is installed, working in big picture mode.
* sixad is set up, paired to one of my DS3s.

Things I want to do:

* Steam doesn't see my DS3. Apparently I'll need to emulate a 360 controller with xboxdrv.
* Speaking of Steam... game selection is lackluster for the combination of Linux *and* local multiplayer (I have a proper PC gaming setup upstairs for when I'm home alone). Halfheartedly considering converting this guy to Windows. Really don't want to.
* Disable accelerometer in sixad so I can actually map buttons in games
* I'd like some kind of launcher outside XBMC. Something optimized for a TV setting where I can pick individual games that I've installed from, say, Humble Bundle installers. Haven't seen anything nice yet.
* Gotta install Firefox and optimize it for TV. Not really sure how to approach here either.
* My keyboard SUCKS. I need a pointer too.

All that said, it kinda feels like I'm not getting much use out of it. At this point it will merely a glorified video player that connects to my network and does a few games. Surely there's more? I want ideas.

PS: Yes, I have an obscenely overpowered GPU in it. Laugh all you want. Fermis, while notoriously hot, are actually quite quiet. Since they are designed for very high operating temperatures, they don't need much airflow to get plenty of heat dissipation.

Currently I have an old gaming PC running as my HTPC. It's a bit ugly, but it has a q6600 intel chip, 4 gbs of ram, and 6850 radeon. I plan on using it for XBMC and Steam big picture mode. I want to upgrade the box to a more ""HTPC"" looking case, but I have a normal size mobo and replacing the CPU and mobo with a micro didn't seem cost effective just for ascetics. Please persuade me otherwise. 

Otherwise in the house we have a few laptops (2 macs, 2 pcs) and a gaming desktop. I would like a central back up solution. One possibility is running small business server on my htpc, but I rather not leave a 430w power supply running all the time. So I think I need a NAS to do two things. One -- back up my stuff. I want it to be automated and work with both mac and PC. Second -- store my media so any device can access our downloads (tablet, apple tv, etc). 

We currently have a synology box at work for a private cloud and it's awesome. But I've read that using it as a media server has mixed results. Since I have a htpc that should be doing most of the heavy lifting will this be an issue? The synology boxes also have seedbox capabilities built in which are pretty attractive.

1368684078.0,6,self.htpc,1efpup,Critiques of my first HTPC build? (AMD),7,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1efpup/critiques_of_my_first_htpc_build_amd/,"I want something fairly small and not ugly that will do the usual HTPC stuff (playing downloaded/streamed content that is), as well as do a bit of gaming. Not high-settings modern games, but ideally I'd like to be able to emulate everything up to Dreamcast and PS2; all generations below that are a must.  And I'd like a tiny bit of CPU-future-proofness since decoding high quality media seems to be getting more intensive with time.  Flexible budget somewhere around $500.  I am in Canada.

Originally I was looking at mini ITX cases like the Apex Mi-008 and [this sexy beast](http://www.ecosmartpc.com/ei5.html). But I read about heat and space issues in the Apex.  The silver Ei5 is, visually, my absolute favorite, but then I started looking at currently available FM2 ITX mobos, and the selection looks pretty weak right now.  The thing is going to be fairly hidden and I have the space, so I am going with micro ATX.

So here we have my selections and some features I like about them.

[PCPartPicker part list](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/XAAG) / [Benchmarks](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/XAAG/benchmarks/)

**Case** | [Apex DM-387 HTPC Case w/275W Power Supply](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/apex-case-dm387) | $44.77 @ DirectCanada 

* It looks decent, it is smallish yet roomier than those ITX ones, it has a translucent front so I can put a CIR receiver in there, and it's insanely cheap even before the fact that it comes with a usable power supply.

**CPU** | [AMD A6-5400K 3.6GHz Dual-Core Processor](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-ad540kokhjbox) | $62.99 @ NCIX 

* If I had gone with a Llano or even Trinity A4, I think I could have gotten away with ITX, but this should provide me with some extra oomph for gaming.  My understanding is that this APU can handle PS2 emulation.

**Motherboard** | [ASRock FM2A75 Pro4-M Micro ATX  FM2 Motherboard](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/asrock-motherboard-fm2a75pro4m) | $74.99 @ Newegg Canada 

* CIR and USB3.0 are important to me. Beyond that I know almost nothing about what I should be looking for in a motherboard, other than ""make sure the CPU fits"".  FM2 = future upgradability, which is nice.  Also this board does not appear to share the heat/voltage/QC issues with its mITX cousins, knock on wood.

**Memory** | [G.Skill Ripjaws X Series 4GB (2 x 2GB) DDR3-1600 Memory](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/gskill-memory-f312800cl9d4gbxl) | $36.99 @ Canada Computers 

**Storage** | [Sandisk  128GB 2.5"" Solid State Disk](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/sandisk-internal-hard-drive-sdssdp128gg25) | $99.05 @ DirectCanada 

* Just for OS and programs. I already have a 4TB external.

**Case Fan** | [SilenX EFX-08-12 25.0 CFM 80mm  Fan](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/silenx-case-fan-efx0812) | $6.99 @ NCIX 

* Because everyone complains about the Apex case fan being too loud.

**Operating System** | [Microsoft Windows 8 (OEM) (64-bit)](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/microsoft-os-wn700404) | $97.99 @ NCIX 

**Keyboard** | [Microsoft Arc Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/microsoft-keyboard-j5d00001) | $36.98 

**Total** | $460.75

Other stuff:

* Inteset internal CIR receiver (around $30)

* Xbox controller wireless adapter thing

* Optical drive: I have an internal DVDRW lying around that would be convenient for the occasional rented movie.  But if it would be more beneficial to have more airflow / less heat, I could easily avoid an optical drive altogether and just use my external one. Or I could spend $30 on a slim internal if that would help.

I want to run my set top box (cable) into Windows Media Center to use it as my PVR. I had this set up with my old machine, but I can't seem to find a USB IR blaster / receiver that isn't over $50. 

I am trying to re-purpose a few internal parts from an old school HP media center that it came shipped with. It had a Hauppauge tuner (SD), an internal media card reader with an IR receiver and an IR blaster port in the back.  I pulled out the IR parts but have no way of connecting them  as the case has a door that covers all of the slot and bays. 

I was going to dremel a bay cover to add the media card IR thing and just the blaster to the back some how, but that wont work. I was also going to get an external hard drive case and pop the parts into it. But it is internally powered and is connect using internal usb cables.

I basically want to run my cable into media center, use a media center remote to change the channel and have the HTPC blast the channel change to the set top box. (I am in Canada and CableCards are not an option). I tried the Hauppauge HD PVR, but it doesn't work.

Here is a pic of the parts I am trying to work with.

For the build, it would be my first build so I am a little nervous but still confident that I could do everything. Also, booting from windows on a USB seems to be a problem on the barebones system. The barebones system will be hooked to external 1TB HD for storage. Is it a question of ease vs power. Is there more in the build? Will either the build or the barebones struggle at all with 1080p?

* budget not more that about $900, but way happier with $500 or under
* dual OTA for viewing &amp; recording
* watch video streamed from net; Netflix &amp; Amazon, et al. (WiFi)
* watch video streamed from NAS (WiFi)
* watch an occasional DVD or blue ray
* listen occasional CD - no ripping needed
* listen/pull audio from NAS for playback (WiFi)
* quick boot, but nearly always on
* very quiet, nearly silent operation
* Win7 OS probably WMC for video, but that may change
* Winamp for audio
* WiFi N only; can't get Ethernet cable to HTPC location
 
It needs to be able to capture &amp; store away two simultaneous HD OTA channels while:

* watching a DVD/blue ray, or
* watching streaming HD online media, or
* listening to online audio (local NAS, Pandora, Spotify)

I don't get-n-rip movies, just stream from online providers.
This machine won't be used as a primary storage except for captured OTA, and I'm not concerned with backups of that media.

Video will be direct to LCD via HDMI.

Audio will be direct to amp via optical connection.

I know the SDD is overkill, but I do like speedy reboots.

The machine won't be used for any gaming except for MMOs/MMORPG.

I have the normal stream of questions:

* Will this processor keep up with my needs?
* Is the relative quality of components balanced?
* Any, ""for $5 more"" I can get a much better component?
* Are there some trade-off somewhere?

I have two cards, an ATI TV Wonder 600 USB and the MyGica HDTV Thriller.

I only have a BASIC cable package with Comcast (only really need the internet), and have previously tuned to 7.1 (the only channel I wish to record) on 32-bit Windows 7.

2  x pc's in the office networked with a 1TB HD full of TV shows/movies. when we want to watch something we have to put it on a USB stick then play it on the Xbox360 in the lounge. but often it’s in a format it doesn’t read and you have to convert it.


I’d love to be able to just switch on the TV and get access to everything!

So what are my options? I don’t have a super TV, I only need to stream 720p(I think) I’m happy to keep all the downloading on the PC's. I have looked at a few android boxes, but have heard they are not up to it yet. Is a Raspberry Pi what I’m after? I’m not sure how it would fit into the networked HD. 


So I’m not sure what my options are? Anyway general advice needed. If I should ditch the HD and move everything to something else or network it differently? Let me know.

All I really want is to download/rip 1080p movies and to view them in my home theatre setup with the least amount of effort. That's it. I already have the TV and the sound system, all I need is the front-end system with some Media PC software that is low maintenance, can play 1080p movies (.mkv, .mp4), and can automatically sort my movies.

So, my questions:

*  Is there a STB or pre-made solution (like WDTV, Apple TV, ZBOX) that can handle 1080p and run free Media Center software?
*  If not, what is the bare minimum CPU/GPU requirements for running 1080p videos?

A bit about me: I've been a casual HTPC user for a while now -- not tech-savvy enough to stay up to speed and tweak XBMC, so I used Boxee until they stopped updating the desktop client. I have hardware experience building PCs, so I have no hesitation about building a new box, but I don't think I have the competence to keep up with tweaking XBMC to perfection (unless I have the wrong impression of XBMC?).

Questions are:

* Is that 8400GS card gonna cut it for HD?  If not, any recommendations on a good low-power card to take its place?  (Won't be doing anything more than ""casual"" games on this thing)

* I've read quite a bit of stuff on the sidebar and some old posts, but can't seem to come to a consensus on how good Media Center is as a channel guide/recording substitute.  Not a big fan of Cox's box, but one thing it doesn't do is forget my shows, even if after a long off-season.  In fact half the time I don't even know a new show is back on until I see it in the recorded list.  Anybody have good feedback on this?  I know Win8 is a wildcard here too, so may be too early to tell.

* I have the Logitech Harmony Xbox Remote (IR only) -- I found [this](http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Control-Infrared-Receiver-Ultimate/dp/B00224ZDFY/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340218144&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=vrc-1100) Remote/IR receiver that apparently can work with the IR Harmony, but sounds like it's a bear to set up.  Should I just ditch my Harmony IR or are there suggestions to salvage it?
* Is the [Ceton InfiniTV 4](http://www.amazon.com/Ceton-InfiniTV-PCIe-4-channel-CableCARD/dp/B003B4VLJQ) pretty much the holy grail of tuner cards?  I see it everywhere...is there another recommended option that isn't $200 with most of that capability?

* Finally...am I missing anything?  I see references to HD PVRs too...but I'm not exactly sure what that would be for if I already have the hardware I have spec'd out here.

Anyways, I was wondering about hard disk management, as I'm currently using a Nas4Free box which has 3 500 GB hard drives mounted as Raid 5, which gives me 1 TB storage space.

Between pictures, music, and movies, it's already filled up 80%. Now, I plan on keeping movies here, so I'll quickly need an upgrage storage-wise.

I'm wondering if I should either buy a single 2 TB hard drive which will be used solely for movies, or upgrade the whole RAID array.

(The RAID was firstly built in order to backup family photos and music.)

Of course, budget is an issue as I don't want to spend hundreds of euros in hard drives. Yet, I'm afraid of disk failure (already happened to me once), and it'd be a bummer to lose 2 TB worth of movies.

3: Play/stream smooth 1080p video to my HDTV easily (with no lag.)

4: Something that feels quick and snappy. Trying to avoid a sluggish system that takes an eternity to start up, or open a program.

5: The ability to connect to a surround sound system.

6: Fast wireless connection. Currently using
[this router](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833122466&amp;name=Wireless-Routers/) (not sure if that matters)

7: Something that is fairly quiet

8: Option to add a TV tuner in the future.

9: No need for gaming.

10: Ability to use a remote and wireless keyboard/mouse

11: Should I go with Windows 7 or 8?

12: Bluetooth? not sure if this is really needed or if it can be installed internally. What do you think?

My budget for hardware is $600.

Do you guys think I will get better future proofing and performance with the i3 and 7750 combo over Trinity? The GPU benchmarks for trinity are out, but I am concerned about its CPU performance. Budget is not really an issue, I am most concerned about best performance with least power/heat.

I had been running 5.1 audio via s/pdif through an Onkyo receiver and out to some Infinity Classia speakers. The Onkyo receiver died (might be repairable, but beside the point). Currently, I'm running just stereo audio through a repurposed Roland UA25-EX USB audio out to M-Audio bookshelf BX5a studio monitors.

This works surprisingly well for stereo, but I want to go back to 5.1.

I don't need it to handle video, since I just do HDMI straight to the projector, and I don't need a tuner, or multiple inputs.

[I will be using a 1TB hard drive which I already own for storage]

I have had some experience putting PCs together in the past, and although I've been out of the loop for awhile on current parts, this build seems fairly appealing to me. If there are any glaring flaws, please feel free to point them out, it would be much appreciated.

My major questions are the following: 

1) What operating system would you recommend I run? I am currently leaning towards a simple Windows 7 build with XBMC to handle my media. I would like for this PC to remain open for access by any device in the house so I can stream video to my laptop in  my room, etc.

2) Is there a good way to integrate an Android tablet (looking at the Nexus 7) into this system to use as a remote, and possibly to stream video onto.

3) Is this even a good idea? I find the idea of an independent PC attractive, but I've also heard about set-top boxes and that sort of thing, and was wondering if that might be a simpler, better solution?

Clearly I'm not entirely well informed on the project I am working on right now, but I won't be buying anything until I have the whole thing planned out. I'm really hoping some of you who have more experience than I do will be able to shed some light on the areas I don't know that much about, and hopefully will be willing to call me out on my mistakes.

I'll be using this HTPC on a 60"" HDTV and it will be for the following:
* Windows 7 w/ XBMC - probably lots of skinning/plugins
* Playing/decoding HD video
* Netflix/Youtube/Hulu Streaming (HD)
* Usenet setup (Sab, Sick Beard, Couch Potato)
* Skype
* General web browsing and streaming from websites


This build won't be for gaming, just media purposes.


Here is a build I came up with based on my own research as well as looking at previous rigs posted here.

I didn't list hard drives because I've already got an SSD along with a larger HDD that I will be using for the OS and media storage.


My main concern here is whether these are compatible. I think they are but a second opinion would be nice. As well, I have concerns about the cooler being adequate for the processor and case. I'm not well versed with how to pick out a proper cooler so the one listed was chosen because it had decent reviews at a mediocre price.


I've also thought about using the AMD A6-3500 processor instead of the A8, but I think the extra ~$50 is worth it for future-proofing the device.

In short: I have a collection of movies (DVDs and blu-rays), TV broadcasts on my PC (mostly sports), and tons of games.  I also have a Comcast DVR that I wouldn't mind getting rid of.  I was thinking something along the lines of a small form-factor HTPC with a small SSD for running XBMCbuntu, a NAS for all the content, a dual-tuner card for DVR functionality, some emulators, and my PS3 controllers over bluetooth for games.  My living room isn't very well wired for internet and I'm hoping to put the NAS in my room and have the HTPC use 802.11n to pull from it.

First, does anyone see any issues with that?  Is XBMCbuntu a bad choice since I want DVR and PS3 bluetooth functionality?

What would a good NAS for this be?  Obviously a lot of storage is a must, but some of the NAS recommendations I've seen have been obscene ($1000 without HDs).  Price isn't a concern if it's worth it, but I'd like to keep the cost down where I can.  In other words, I'm frugal, but I'll spend a bit extra if it's justified.

So I have my heart set on putting together a mini ITX build and I need a bit of help on finding a particular case. I've narrowed down my choices to the [Habey EMC-600BL](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811321016&amp;Tpk=Black%20Habey%20EMC-600BL), which fits perfectly on the top of my desk and doesn't look too obtrusive.

Now, the Habey and K-Book are the same re-branded items, which leads me to believe there must be an American equivalent to the T-Book as well. So, have any of you seen a similar case on the market?

The problem occurs with my recording schedule. I often record multiple things in a row (all the good shows occur around prime time) When this happens, the first show records fine, but all the subsequent shows get the beginning cut off. 

This wouldn't be so bad if the overlap was perfectly matched up. (ie: the beginning of one show was contained at the end of the previous one.) But it doesn't match. there is usually something like 2 minutes missing. We often end up watching the beginning of a show on hulu, and then switching to wmc. (obviously not ideal.)

How did I miss/overlook this?

Back to the reason for my post.  I'm getting ready for some big changes in the way I receive TV and want some advice on what I should plan for.

I currently have cable through Comcast, but my telephone company is upgrading EVERYONE to ftth (fiber to the home).  The last estimate I got was that my section would go live at the end of the month.  They will be providing the fastest internet in the state, tv service and of course phone service.

I have what I call a hybrid HTPC setup.  I do all of my recording through my main tower in my basement, but watch most of it through a desktop machine in my living room.  Both machines are Dell Optiplex's.  The tower is a 760 and the living room one is a 745.  Each are running win7 ultimate, with 4 gigs of ram, core2duo 2.4 - 3.06ghz.  I have a gigabit lan in my home, so bandwidth isn't really an issue.  I control my unit downstairs (which is connected to a tv as well) with a standard wmc remote.  I use a gyration mouse/keyboard for my living room setup (which I think is awesome).

I dvr using a Haupauge 1850.  While it's not HD, or widescreen, it works.  I don't even have HD tv service yet.

I've been considering getting a cablecard tuner but can't find much info on them.  My phone company is new in the biz, and from what I've been told by others, know nothing about the technology.  Is there anyway I can use a cablecard with them?

Enough of that rant.  I'm so glad I found this place.

What got me into the idea was that I have recently discovered the world of Ubuntu and SFTP as a means to access files anywhere - so naturally I thought I would need a server that I could leave on somewhere and that would be that.. Things have escalated in my mind. I'm sure you're familiar with how it goes..

I've read the sidebar and dome some research.. But I've never built a computer before so would like some advice before I go and spend any money.

**What I will be doing with it**

Watching downloaded movies/tv shows: Downloading via torrents/usenet and playing using XMBC

Powered up 24/7 so it can act as a media/document server

I envisage maybe using it to stream to a computer/portable device in the future not more than one at a time - so dual core is ok right?

Space is nice but I don't think initially i'll need more than 1TB - can I get away with one hard drive? money is a kind of issue..

I'd like to load calibre on it and get it hosting my ebook library too

Basically not that intensive stuff as these things go I don't think

Requirements:
* Stream content from my Home server (without media format issues like PS3)
* Stream from online sources like Netflix, Hulu, Youtube etc
* Internet (I have a Ethernet outlet near my media center)
* Play Blu-Ray movies
* 7.1 (or at least 5.1) surround sound
* 1080p HD. I want ONE HD cable running to my AV receiver etc
* RF remote to type and navigate
* Small footprint and low noise levels
* Currently NO plans of recording TV shows etc on this HTPC

I am currently working on trying to figure out how to add the netflix plugin to Google Chrome. I started by taking the user agent of ChromeOS and spoofing it on my computer so it is the same, the user agent for ChromeOS 28 is: 

    Mozilla/5.0 (X11; CrOS x86_64 4100.68.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/28.0.1500.68 Safari/537.36

With that I am able to get past the first ""step"" of authentication, Netflix then lets click the button to stream video, but when I do it loads ~5% before it spits out this error code: 

http://i.imgur.com/qj8oQGE.png

The cause of this error code is that the normal version of Chrome does not have the Netflix plugin that ChromeOS has, this plugin is needed in order to decode the data from Netflix (allows for DRM). So I then pulled what I believe are the 2 applicable files from my chromebook (you can download them [here] (https://mega.co.nz/#F!q5IHlLKY!b5HReSv0yWkoVNDIbHf94A
)) and copied them over to the equivalent place on my Linux computer (/opt/google/chrome/PepperFlash/libnetflixhelper.so), however they are still not showing up in the list of plugins. 

So this is where I need you guys to help me, I need to figure out what is stopping Chrome from recognizing this plugin. My personal guess is that there is some ""index"" file somewhere, that is used for the indexing of Chrome's plugins, and we may need to add the netflix plugin to that list. 

So does anyone have any ideas on how the installation of chrome plugins works? 

Edit1: According to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1a443g/netflix_now_has_an_html5_client_but_still_no/c8uhgu3) comment, manifest.json is the ""index"" file that we are looking for. However, I tried making the change he suggested and it was still a no go. Sadly /u/invapid has not been seen for over a month, so we can't ask him for more details. 

Edit2: Just found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1a443g/netflix_now_has_an_html5_client_but_still_no/c8twfjb) comment, which seems to imply that this is not impossbile as we don't have the hardware needed to do this, I doubt this is true, so I'm going to go ahead and try installing ChromeOS on my laptop following [this](http://zzsethzz.blogspot.com/2013/02/install-chromium-upgrade-it-to-chrome.html) tutorial. If I can get Netflix streaming from that, then I know for sure that specialized hardware is not needed.

I've actually tried posting this in the buildapc subs but got minimal responses. I was hoping coming straight to the source for HTPC related things would help.

Keeping this short, I am ditching my xbox(a netflix/minecraft machine at this point) for a HTPC. I've been researching links (the sidebar producerism one was fantastic) and parts but I simply dont know if, for what I need, the parts I have are good for the build. Obviously, I'd like to spend as little as possible.

The HTPC will need to handle:

- Streaming/netflix/ptv/downloading/pvr/sickbeard/etc through XBMC or media browser most likely

- Minecraft (my son plays it on my xbox and really enjoys it)

- Very light video conversion as needed, just in case

- Emulation, NES to GC/PSX, through hyperspin or maximus (This is the least important feature, but one I would like to be able to do)

Thats pretty much it, barring me finding out some other cool things to do with a HTPC. No other games besides emulated ones and minecraft will be played, no steam, no semi modern games, nothing.

I had these parts picked out but again don't know if I need more/less. I went with micro atx, but if there's a cheaper way to go mini itx thats fine.

The Silverstone ML03B is almost the perfect HTPC case for me. It's thin and uses common desktop-sized parts. Unfortunately **it can't sit vertically**.

My current entertainment center doesn't have horizontal space for it, so I would like to have it stand adjacent in an upright fashion. Someday I might get a new entertainment center, then it would be great to have it sit horizontally.

All vertical standing cases with similar thinness come with some odd-sized PSU. I want to be able to use reuse my leftover parts from my main PC as I upgrade.

I've spent hours looking at every case on Newegg, TigerDirect, pcpartpicker and many other places. If such a thing doesn't exist, I'd really like to jury-rig something to make the ML03B sit vertically.

* *  monitoring the CPU load: its sometimes peaky but not over 40% most of the time
* *  re-setting up all the channel's and re-tuning them
*** I noticed the CPU was running hot, so I replaced the heat transfer paste and it worked flawlessly for one night.... weird.
* playing old recordings is flawless**

So I'm looking to put together a box that can run a full web browser for streaming video content from various sources, playback of local HD video content, transcoding for streaming to a couple of tablets via Plex, plus a crap ton of space for mirroring music and video that will be synced with cloud services.

I'm stuck between an Ivy Bridge build with a 2x2.9ghz cpu, or an AMD build with a 2x3.4ghz cpu. The AMD build is about $25 cheaper and involves a significantly faster processor, but I've never done an AMD build and there are a lot of letters and numbers I don't necessarily understand that are involved.

Specifically, I'm looking at these parts:

[AMD A4-5300](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819113283)

[MSI FM2-A75MA-E35](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130662)

[LG 12x BluRay combo drive](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827136252)

plus $90 for a copy of W7 = $499.94 plus shipping

**OR**

[Intel Pentium G2020 Ivy Bridge cpu](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116886)

[ASUS P8B75-M LE](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131842)

[the same BluRay drive](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827136252)

so is there a reason to spend the extra money on a slower cpu, or am I just falling into some sort of brand loyalty trap with Intel chips? Also, am I spending too much money on any of these parts (i.e. the case) when I could get by with a cheaper option. Bare in mind, I don't particularly care what it looks like or if it is totally silent, it's more important that it works for what I need it for and is almost unreasonably cheap.

I have a few questions on this setup and whether performance will be an issue.

First, PC specs:

* i5 3570k quad core processor

* HD 7770 GPU

* ASRock Extreme 4 mobo

* 8GB Ram

* 128 GB SSD 

* 750 GB HDD


My SDD holds windows 7 and program files while my other HD is used for media.  My currently plan is to purchase an HDHomeRun Dual Network Tuner and use WMC to record my usual shows from my antenna.  I would set up Plex MS on my PC and use it to stream the 'DVR' content to a Roku 3.


What problems might I see with this setup?  Technically, this should be sound, however, I wonder about my PCs abilities to do the HTPC work as well as anything else I may be doing on the PC at the time.  For instance, I often play games like Path of Exile or Civ 5 while my wife is watching her shows.  I am assuming that my processor will be able to handle the transcoding and gaming, but I'm afraid it might be an incorrect assumption.  


I'd also like to note that I have an old PC that I could use as my DVR and media server, however I'd have to buy some new hardware for it (mainly HD).  It also runs on Linux, which means I'd have to find new DVR software and get Plex to work on that OS.  This PC has an e8400 core 2 duo processor, 4gb ram, and HD 4850 video card.  I worry about the transcoding while streaming with this PC, though it may do the job just fine.

I plan on ditching cable, or at least severely paring it down to basic cable. I want my HTPC to be able to record live TV, both as a DVR of sorts as well as (hopefully) the ability to permanently archive content to my media library.  I currently have *everything* my cable company offers, and would like to take advantage of this before making the cut. 
The only mistake I made in purchasing parts for my HTPC was that I bought the Hauppauge 1187 WinTV-HVR-1250 to go in my Silverstone MLO3B, which is half-height, and the card is standard size.  

So, first off - can anyone recommend a good half-height (is this referred to as 'low profile'?) video capture card?  I would like to use this within XBMC if possible, and support HD content.  I also want to use this in two different scenarios - one as a true TV tuner for when I get rid of my cable box, the other as a simple capture card that receives digital content from my current cable box.

And some other questions:

* Can I simply use it as a 'VCR', and just record whatever video is being fed into it?  (While I still have premium cable, can I just pass the cable box output into the HTPC and record whatever is playing?)
* Are there restrictions when using a video capture card with digital content?  Once I drop the cable box and plug the coax directly into the card to use as a tuner, what kind of problems should I expect to run into?  (I do know that some providers encrypt their feed, i'm not sure if mine does - Brighthouse cable, which is an offshoot of TimeWarner, so they tend to share a lot of the same resources - for instance we also have RoadRunner cable.)
* Has anyone gotten PVR to work through XBMC directly?  I've been reading up on it and it seems like it's somewhat involved.  Any good walkthroughs or resources for this?
* Any must-have software I should get for the things I want to do?

I thought I had more questions but they seem to be eluding me - need moar coffee.


As for my setup:  

* Silverstone MLO3B
* Mobo: ASRock Pro4-M (1 PCI-E x16 3.0, 1 PCI-E x1 2.0, 2 PCI-E x16 2.0)
* 8GB RAM

I'm currently using a WD Live SMP but not happy with the way it displays my movie and TV catalogue and also can't record TV via a guide.

I've decided to get a small HTPC build, planning on using XBMC or MediaPortal, with all my media being stored on a NAS. But I thought, if I'm going to have a full size HTPC case in my cabinet, then maybe it's worth looking at doing some gaming (BF3 and TF2 mainly).

So far, I've got laying around:
* Seasonic 650w PSU
* 60GB Intel SSD
* 1TB HDD
* GTX570
* 2 x 2GB DDR3
* Win7 Home Premium
* TV tuner

So now I need a case, CPU and motherboard. I'm also wanting this to run fairly quiet and as little power as possible when not gaming.

What CPU (and I guess motherboard) would you all suggest? I was leaning towards an FX4100, but its a couple of generations old already. Happy to use AMD or Intel.

Secondly, is there a way to turn off the GTX570 when just watching movies or TV?

Lastly, what sort of power would a setup like this consume in hibernate?

My HTPC runs on an A6-5400k.  Originally it was built solely for HTPC use, but I've recently decided to do some PC gaming on it.  The A6 has handled older games very well on my 720p television (Portal 2, Assassins Creed 2, Team Fortress 2, Far Cry 2... all seem to run well with decent graphics settings).

Now, from what I understand, crossfiring the AMD A-series with a Radeon dGPU doesn't really yield results that are worth making an investment.  And if you go with an nVidia card, you lose the integrated graphics which was one of the selling points for the AMD APU in the first place.

Now my question is this; are there any graphics cards out there that would increase the performance of my PC when it comes to gaming that might yield better results than what I've seen from the crossfire benchmarks with the A6? 

My requirement for any card would be low profile (fitting into a mini ITX case) and HDMI out.  Any suggestions, thoughts, or comments? ",,False,self,t5_2rbfy,False,,,True,t3_17yjin,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/17yjin/amd_aseries_apus_with_graphics_cards/,

In my case my HTPC sits in my office and looks like a standard desktop with monitor, keyboard, and mouse, but I also have HDMI and audio cables going through the walls to my living room TV and 5.1 audio system.  In the living room I control it from the couch with my Nexus 7 tablet running a program called Unified Remote which gives a simulated mouse and keyboard via wifi.  I have Unified Remote configured with 1-button switching between TV and office monitor.  I also have a 360 controller which works great through the walls for gaming.  The benefits of this setup are zero noise, no ugly box in my living room, and admining the system is easily done from the office.  Since I have one system being my gaming PC, HTPC, and file server I only have to upgrade and maintain one machine.  I can game at the desk or on the couch, whichever suits me.  While my run between office and living room was pretty short, a good HDMI cable should go 50 feet so I see no reason a longer run couldn't be achieved.  AMA

Got a problem/some questions for you. I'm using TMT5 for folder BR playback from WMC's native movie library. The entire PC and TV are calibrated for 0-255 black levels. All videos work fine in the correct color space. TMT5 though, uses it's own levels which causes crushed blacks and overblown contrast. This was tested/confirmed via the AVSForum calibration BR disc via TMT5 and the AVSForum MP4 calibration video files via WMC video library. Now, in the TMT5 desktop/standalone player I can adjusts its brightness/contrast settings for movies to display correctly. However, these settings don't carry over to the WMC interface, and you can not adjust brightness/contrast in the WMC interface either. It was confirmed by another user on their forums as well. I've contacted support and they had me try some adjusted .ini files which did not work. They then said I'm basically shit-out-of-luck and would have to use the desktop player if I want proper black levels. :/ That does me no good as this is a WMC HTPC controlled via remote. On their forum, Arcsoft_Jason said that this would then be an engineering issue which they don't have sufficient resources to put behind a fix. Great resolution. Makes you appreciate some other companies like Ceton.

Anyway, my question. For those who have their HTPCs/TVs calibrated for 0-255, does TMT3 (via WMC) have this issue? What about those of you who use PowerDVD via WMC? And how about WinDVD (I don't even know if that has a WMC plug-in)?

I have considered raid solutions in the past but having different sized drives makes conventional methods less then useful.  Also I think one of the advantages of having it set up the way I have is that the drives are not all simultaneously active.  Hopefully the drives will last longer.

At the same time I'm also looking for it to run a little light gaming in steam's big picture. Not particularly trying to get everything to run on max but comfortably run modern games on low at a half decent framerate. That's where I kind of start to hesitate, is the onboard gpu powerful enough to let's say run borderlands 2 on lowest everything at 60ish fps?

Here's a build I got going, in the near future I'll buy a remote and bluetooth dongle, and I have a blu ray drive from my gaming rig that I am just going to use in this as I don't use it anyway.

I have been stalking some of the threads recently.  I have seen that some builds come in at ~$200 and others come in at $600.  I was wondering why there are such big price differences.

For my requirements, I would want 1080p playback, it to function as a DLNA server, and it to eventually have a TV tuner card added to record TV (I would do this once I build a NAS for storage).

I would never use this machine for anything other than displaying/streaming video and other video-like content.  I would also want it to look sleek.  I think an HTPC that blends nicely into a theater system really makes a big difference (look like a standard unit, isn't giant).  Lastly, power consumption is a concern of mine.  I'd want a unit that uses as low power as possible.

With those requirements in mind, is it possible to build a fully featured HTPC server (minus the capture card) for the $200 price point?  Would investing a few hundred more dollars make a huge difference?  If so, what would it change?

Thanks!

Additional questions:

Does anyone know if there is any open source slingbox-like software that would enable someone to remote control the HTPC and see the content on their own screen?
Can the HTPC be used as a slingbox receiver?

I'm new to the whole HTPC setup and have been trying to do as much research as I can but I can't really seem to get a clear understanding when it comes to getting cable to my PC.

For the record: I currently have Charter HD service in Connecticut.
My goal is to drop my set top box and simply use the HTPC with my cable subscription.

Somebody correct me if I'm wrong on this as I don't want to buy more/not enough and screw myself over. This is a collection of information I've gotten online and through the cable representative.

My overall goal (and I'll probably be posting more questions) is to get an all-in-one system for Cable/Movies/Games/Internet rather than have multiple external boxes.

I will need:
A TV Tuner card that supports Cable Cards. I was thinking:
http://www.amazon.com/Ceton-InfiniTV-PCIe-4-channel-CableCARD/dp/B003B4VLJQ

This seems to be the only internal 2+ channel card that supports CableCard. 

A Tuning Adapter - Provided by my cable company.

A computer that works.

There are a host of other equipment I know I'll need (HDMI video card, etc, etc) but assuming I have the rest of it set up, these 3 parts (Card, Tuner, Adapter) are all I need to get Cable to my PC, record and also play it?

Any suggestions/comments on this setup? Is there a better alternative?

Now I know no HTPC pre-made is going to be perfect for everything I need (that is why people build their own), but I was surprised when my multiple-week-long search really didn't turn up what I was looking for because all I really want are three things:

* Cheap (sub $500)
* 1080p output with no hickups
* TV Tuner for DVR capabilities

It's the last one that seems to be the sticking point. There are TONS of small, cheap ideal-for-what-I-am-looking-for HTPCs, but NONE of them have a TV Tuner.

My current setup is as follows:

I have a PS3 which I almost exclusively use as a DVD/Blu-Ray player (I'm a PC gamer). I also have a Seagate Freeagent Theater+ for playing (up to) 1080p MKV files either from an external hard drive but mainly from a Nas4Free computer I have, which is running 3 500 GB hard drives in Software Raid and provides video/audio/photos using uPnP.

Both the PS3 and the FreeAgent are connected to a Pioneer Amp (which supports DTS and DD), a Samsung LE40C630 1080p LCD TV, and a BenQ W100 videoprojector (only 480p but has a DVI input, and it does the job so far).

I would like to ditch both the FreeAgent and the PS3, and switch to an HTPC. For the OS, I think I'm going to go for XBMCbuntu (I was going for Plex at first but I like XBMC better).

Here are the parts I'm able to salvage from my dad's old computer (I offered him a new one, so I get to have his spare parts).

- [Asus P5KPL-AM](http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/Intel_Socket_775/P5KPLAM/)
- Pentium Dual Core E5200
- 2 GB of RAM

I still have to buy a graphic card, PSU, case, and Blu-Ray player. I plan on going the cheap way, as I'll only be using the HTPC to play MKVs, Blurays, maybe a bit of youtube and surfing the web.

For the Graphic Card, I think I'm going to go for a Sapphire Radeon HD 5450 (with passive cooling), which has 1GB of onboard memory and an HDMI output.

For the Sound Card (as I'll need an optical output), I'll probably go for an [Auzentech X-Studio 5.1](http://www.auzentech.com/site/products/x-studio.php).

For the Blu-Ray Player, I'd go for the [LG CH10LS28](http://www.lg.com/nl/computer-producten/optical-storage/LG-blu-ray-disc-reader-intern-CH10LS28.jsp).

Here are my questions :

1 - Could this build be powerful enough to decode Blu-Ray discs and 1080p MKV files?

2 - Is there something I'm forgetting?

I recently read a lifehacker post from this subreddit about a great $500 htpc. It looks awesome, but I figured I should probably look for alternatives. Having no knowledge of the components currently out there, I would not really know the pros/cons or what is possible from an htpc.


edit: Just found out that AMD should be releasing a new apu in a month or two that would be good for htpcs with light gaming.

1. I want to be able to play 1080P mkv files on this, as well as some light emulator based gaming (classic games, nothing newer than N64).  Do I really need the discrete graphics card or would the Intel HD4000 + i3-3220 be enough to handle this?
2. Any thoughts on that case? I like the look of it and the fact that it comes with a power supply, but I'm not familiar with it.
3. How much RAM should I really have? I know 8GB would probably be overkill, but do I even need 4GB?

I'm also still up in the air as to SSD v. HDD, but leaning towards SSD since my media will be streaming from a home server and I sort of want the load speeds from the SSD so it wakes up/turns on more quickly.

I have recently bought the Klipsch Quintet 5 speaker setup, and I am looking for a good receiver and sub to go with them. 

I bought the speakers for $200. I am looking for a receiver around $300 and a sub that is around $300 as well.
I live in an apartment and will continue to do so for the next 5 years.
I have a friend at Bestbuy that may hook me up with a discount on the receiver and sub.
I just went to Bestbuy and saw some receivers.

$250 Receivers

Pioneer - 400W 5.1-Ch. 3D Pass-Through A/V Home Theater Receiver [1] http://goo.gl/K8bMK I am not sure how Pioneer is? I have always thought of myself as buying a Denon, but thought I would include it to see what you guys think?

Denon - 550W 5.1-Ch. 3D Pass Through A/V Home Theater Receiver [2] http://goo.gl/ElyXT [3] http://goo.gl/C8clr I'm not sure what is the difference between these two models. I was recommended this at bestbuy. I think bestbuy employees get a good discount on Denon and its also a cheap reciever. I wish it haf more HDMI ports but oh well.

Sony - 945W 7.1-Ch. 3D Pass-Through A/V Home Theater Receiver [4] http://goo.gl/TgscJ Why is this receiver so cheap? 7.1 and better wattage then any other receiver? Do Sony receivers suck?

More expensive (but I should get a discount just like the smaller receviers)

Denon - 600W 5.1-Ch. 3D Pass Through A/V Home Theater Receiver $400 [5] http://goo.gl/9iyz7
Denon - 875W 7.1-Ch. 3D Pass Through A/V Home Theater Receiver $579 [6] http://goo.gl/RYDmR This is probably too far outside my budget even with discount. Futureproofing would nice but I'm guessing that buy the time I get another system I will be able to toss everything out and start anew whith much better hardware.

**My needs**

 - Playing stored videos
 - Playing stored music (preferably scrobbling on last.fm)
 - Netflix
 - Old game system emulation

**OS choice**

 - *Ubuntu* - I would prefer running this whole setup on Ubuntu (Specifically, XBMCBuntu to not suck up extra resources), but I also need Netflix playback.  I know there are televisions that have built in Netflix support, so this would still be doable, as I don't currently own a TV, but I also don't want to throw money at a gimmick.

 - *Windows* - Obviously, there's a lot more apps available, but...it's Windows.  Ever since I switched to Ubuntu, I've been super reluctant to switch back to Windows, but to be honest, I have noticed Windows lets my HDD stop spinning more frequently than Ubuntu.

**Television**

I need around a 40"". and would prefer to spend &lt; $800.  The only requirements I have would be possibly having Netflix integration, if I went with Ubuntu.

**Controllers**

It seems like there are 3 basic options to choose from here:

 - Game controllers - Good for game emulation, crap for typing
 - Remote with keyboard on back - Small form factor, uncomfortable typing
 - Wireless keyboard - Great for typing, but kind of unwieldy

**Questions** 

 - Is XBMC the best program to accomplish these things?
 - Would you recommend Ubuntu + Netflix TV or Windows?
 - What TV would you recommend based on OS suggestion?
 - If Windows, anyone have any experience with Netflix TVs?
 - What type of controller (or combination of them) would be best?

I'm not a techie, but I'm concerned about whether a combination device like this could handle the job of streaming online video, watching a locally stored HD movie or playing a DVD on the primary TV, while also allowing others in my house to access/watch content stored on the HTPC's HDD on their own PCs. Assuming such a combination is feasible, would it be preferable to have more than one (internal) hard drive? (Otherwise, if it is best to keep network shared files on a separate device, is NAS the only way to go?)

Ideally, such a device should probably have a gigabit network connection, HDMI and VGA output, sufficient USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports, and audio out, at a minimum, as well as run relatively cool.

The HTPC is mainly used for TV recording, archiving and watching TV Shows and movies, on-the-fly transcoding (Plex to iOS), mp3 streaming and file storage. Lately, with HD content and more iOS clients watching, it seems to be running out of breath.

My PC is fine for standard tasks but the CPU overheats easily when transcoding stuff (not on-the-fly, but rather for later viewing on portable devices). Since I am no hardcore gamer I am fine with the on-board graphics of my mainboard (Gigabyte GA-MA79GM-S2H). Additionally, but not in use, I have an **ATI Radeon HD 5670** graphics card.

At times when I user my PC there is rarely any HTPC watching going on and vice versa. Watching streamed media and streaming mp3 should be possible while the PC is in use for browsing (redditing!) and home office stuff.

I would like to fuse the uses and upgrade my PC with a Z77 based mainboard (eg. an ASRock Z77 extreme4) and an **i5-2500k** CPU. I would use my dual monitor setup for desktop stuff and hook up my TV via a long HDMI cable (and re-use the graphics card in surround view mode).

I want to upgrade both machines and this seems one way to do it. The (one-the-fly) transcoding seems to be what I need more power for and why not use one more powerful setup rather than two?

I have a HTPC with an ATI Radeon HD 6570 video card that's connected to my TV. I'm running Windows 7 x64 and XBMC for my front end.

I use a different input to watch OTA. After switching back to my HTPC HDMI input on the TV XBMC will report that it ""failed to initialize audio device"" and sure enough, when I exit out of XBMC the volume icon in the sys tray is x'd out. When I look at the sound properties there are no devices listed. After I unplug and plug in the HDMI cable from my PC everything goes back to normal. 

I set the display properties in windows to never turn off. I looked for a power saving setting in device manager to turn off but couldn't find anything. 

Has anyone else had this problem? Any ideas on how to fix it? I hate having to go unplug the HDMI every time I switch back to the PC. 

Thanks in advance for any replies!

TLDR: After switching to my PC's input on the HDTV, no sound from HDMI.

I tried to make this work with the Thermaltake built-in PSU, but it made a racket.  It's probably defective, so I may RMA it if they let me just so that I have a backup.  There are no silent SFX PSUs that I found, and I think many people power their builds with PicoPSUs.  It didn't look to me like those would power this processor. I could be wrong, but it looked to me like only the PW-200-M would do it.

The next problem was the AC/DC converter.  The Dell DA-2 seemed ideal, it has some shutoff protection that won't allow it to power up most motherboards.  Why Mini-Box doesn't have a higher powered converter is beyond me, but I used their [192W 12V converter](http://www.mini-box.com/12v-16A-AC-DC-Power-Adapter), and it works fine.  At $50 it's a ripoff though IMO.  All the PSU calculators I tried for my build said I needed 185W max.  That's my biggest concern with this build, but so far it's worked fine.  I had to build a mount in order to put the PSU in it, and that was the largest amount of work.

I swapped out the fan on the [Slim X3](http://www.amazon.com/Thermaltake-Profile-Height-Cooler-CLP0534/dp/B003WOL4UG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337806686&amp;sr=8-1) for a [Noctua PWM](http://www.amazon.com/Noctua-NF-R8-PWM-Premium-Bearing/dp/B006GD30UC/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337806723&amp;sr=1-1).

So it makes basically no noise.  When I first powered it up with the Noctua fan I didn't think it had turned on it was so quiet.

I decided that I'd take a gamble on a [refurbished Logitech K700 on Newegg.](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823126267) 

So far, definitely worth the pricetag. First of all, it was brand new. Everything still wrapped up, no marks or scratches. The mouse and keyboard is incredibly responsive. In fact, I can pause movies from literally anywhere in my 3 bedroom townhouse. The signal is that strong. And if you've already got a bunch of Logitech gear, this has the Unify adapter, so they can all run off this one USB adapter. Doesn't help me, but a cool feature.

A couple of notes: Since this was intended to be a controller for Google TV, not everything works just the way I want it to, nor does every button have a function. For instance, the play and pause buttons don't work in  [Daum Potplayer](http://www.dvbsupport.net/), my favorite mediaplayer. Not a dealbreaker, because the space bar works just fine for pause and play. It's worth noting that the pause and play buttons DO work on Windows Media Player, though.

Also, DON'T LISTEN TO THE NEWEGG REVIEWS. To right click, all you have to do is hold the Fn button and click. Works just fine.

So yeah, if you're looking for a great htpc keyboard/mouse, you could do a lot worse than this one. I've also heard very good things about the [K400](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Keyboard-Multi-Touch-920-003070/dp/B005DKZTMG/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top) but it was cheaper for me to get the K700 on Newegg at the time I bought it.",,False,self,t5_2rbfy,False,,,True,t3_u121c,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/u121c/review_logitech_k700_keyboardmouse_combo/,

1) Have I gone completely overboard with a 400W power supply?

2) On a related point, can anyone suggest a nice case for this sort of rig? I'm almost tempted to go fanless....

3) Will this achieve DTS-HD/MA passthrough? And if so, is that capacity limited by OS? For example, would it do the job on OpenElec, or a linux flavour, or is Windows a pre-requisite?

- Would prefer nvidia as I may eventually change from Windows to Linux, however not fixed on this.
- Simple browsing would also be done

Adding it as a movie causes all files (chest &amp; back, arms and shoulders, etc) to show up as its own movie..adding as home videos gets close, but you must rename the files a certain way..i JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT the proper way to do it.

I have a Windows 7 Media Center based HTPC and an Logitech Harmony 550. The remote is great but the one annoyance is the delay between button press and on-screen action. When using the remote that came with my Hauppauge tuner, there is no such delay and commands are very snappy.

I figured this was a problem with delays in the Harmony setup software, but no matter what I change these to, things remain frustratingly slow.

Does anyone have any experience with this and if so, how were you able to fix this? It's very annoying when you are quickly going through channels on the guide; trying to stop on a certain channel only to have it still moving seconds after you've stopped.

**Edit**

So, it appears many have this exact problem and no amount of searching yields any fix. So, for now I have retired my Harmony remote. Fortunately, I have a USB-UIRT which means I can use EventGhost to control my IR components in the same way the harmony can--but with my Hauppauge MC remote!

This gives me the best of both worlds: quick responsiveness and multiple component control with one remote.

With EventGhost, I have it so that pressing the power button on my Hauppauge MC remote toggles the TV's Power. In addition, if WMC is already open (when TV is currently on), it closes WMC. However, if WMC is closed (when TV is currently off), it opens it with added command lines to remove the startup animation. I have WMC closed when the TV is off because I use OrbLive to stream LiveTV to my phone/laptop and it doesn't work if WMC is open.

So can I tweak what I've got and make it work well?  I imagine at minimum I'll need to add some memory in those DIMM slots.  I know it won't be a powerhouse but if I can't make it do what I want it to without lagging all the time that would be great for now.

I don't have more than a few thousand to spend on the setup. I am looking for what you would do with the home with a $4,000. We're talking wiring for media and possibly setting up server(s). 

Current Plan:
I plan to have 2 TV's, one in the 'Family Room' and one in the 'Loft' (floor plan link at bottom). I plan (but this can change) to have all of the media in the closet under the stairs called 'Finished Storage' in the floor plan. I was thinking that I might run usb and hdmi from the server into each room. HDMI for the tv and usb so I can hook up a wireless keyboard (with track ball attached) to control the server. The wireless usb receiver will need to be in the same room as me (I suspect) so I'll have to run a cable back to the server. My concern is that 1) this seems like a very inelegant solution and 2) the length of the cables might be a problem.



Requirements for system:

* I want 2 places in the family room and 2 places in the loft where I can plug in the tv. That might be a simple HDMI face plate or something else, but I want to be able to move the tv without running cables through the room.

* The TV's need access to cable (like normal) but I also stream videos from the internet into the TVs so it's important to have full pc-like functionality from my living room.

* I need to be able to control my media fully from the Loft and the Family room.

* Needs to be an elegant solution. Hidden wires, nice wall plates, and any server or equipment needs to either look very professional or hidden.




Questions I have:

* Is running HDMI from the pc to the TV the best solution?

* How's the best way to control the server from the rooms?

* Is the length of the HDMI cable a large concern (or any cable)?

* Is HDMI over cat6 better than strait HDMI?

* Is an HTPC the best solution?

* Is it best to have the server(s) in the closet, or should I just have a server in each room physically (seems ugly???)?

* What's the best way to be able to watch two DIFFERENT things in each room? This is not necessary, I'm ok if the server can only watch one thing at a time, but I'm interested in looking at this. Do I need a server per tv or will 1 pc be enough?

I'm getting an HDTV in the near future, and I want something to go with it. I have a good PC already (suitable for modern gaming), which I could use to stream media, and which alleviates any need for a gaming console. 

Here's a rough ordering of my priority for features:  
1. Stream Netflix. Watch from Hulu (not Hulu Plus) would be a bonus.  
2. Watch DVDs, upgrade to Blu-ray a bonus here.  
3. Stream media (downloaded files, DVDs I have archived, and my iTunes music) from my desktop PC. My PC is wired, the TV will not be near the router so anything would have to be wireless.  
4. Integrate with my current collection of tech -- in addition to my (Windows 7 HP) desktop PC, I have an iPhone, an iPad, and an aging (disused) Mac (G5 tower).  
5. DVR-like features for my cable TV.

Here are the options I see:  
1. AppleTV -- good integration with iTunes and my phone/iPad, no dvd/blu-ray. May require jailbreak to stream all of my files, doesn't do 1080p. Fairly cheap.  
2. Gaming console -- gaming features would go mostly unused, xbox doesn't do blu-ray, middling price.  
3. Build my own HTPC. Should handle 1-3 with no problems, but probably won't integrate with my phone/iPad. Most expensive option, but most likely to do everything I want.

Part of me really wants to go for the HTPC, but at the same time I feel like the price of the appleTV is so much better than an HTPC, I should just go for that. I've got a preliminary build worked out for an HTPC, but the price is quite high in my eyes -- about half what I paid over a year ago for a decent gaming computer. PS3/XBox seem like they don't add many features over an Apple TV, but add a lot of cost... seems like the worst of both worlds. 

Here's the build I'm looking at right now, so you guys can get a sense of price -- feel free to let me know if I've made horrible choices or can save some money here and there.

Build doesn't include any sort of remote or keyboard/wireless. I've also picked stuff that will allow me to add a second, larger HD once prices come back down as well as add a tv tuner card of some sort. I would prefer this to be a linux-based build as well, if possible, so I have gone for an nvidia graphics card, as those seem to have a better reputation.


Am I looking at this wrong? Is the HTPC experience worth the extra cost? Can I reduce the price of the build enough to make it more competitive price-wise? Should I delay and wait for the next version of the Apple TV?

*******

Hello all, I'm ready to pull the trigger and build the system I've been wanting for a long time and would love to hear your comments and suggestions on what I've come up with.

**TL;DR** - Intel Celeron based HTPC/Media Server running Windows 7, WMC, + PLEX to record and stream 1080i video and music to whole house, play older PC games and Blu-Ray DVD. Sharp looking case with 4TB storage and future expansion capability.

****************************

After a good deal of experimenting with several solutions I've settled on PLEX for serving videos and music and Windows Media Center for TV recording and PVR functionality but this may change as time goes on. I'd prefer to go with Linux to save the cost of the Windows license but all of my research keeps pushing me back to WMC being the best solution for OTA recording plus I'd like to be sure I can still run windows apps and do some light gaming (**Fallout 3, Half-Life-2, Mass Effect 2**, etc..).

The system will sit in my living room next to my main TV connected via HDMI and then connect to the bedroom TV via the PLEX app on a Roku. I'll also use this system for playing Blu-Ray DVDs. I considered MythTV but went back to WMC so I could still run Windows based games and apps. My goals are as follows:

* Stream 1080i HD movies, TV shows, and entire music collection to all rooms in the house
* Record full 1080i broadcast resolution, Watch, Pause, Record, &amp; Rewind Live TV, Schedule and record TV shows (allowing me to get rid of my TIVO box)
* Watch and record two TV programs at the same time
* Energy efficient for low cost 24x7 operation
* Near silent operation
* Capable of running some older games, ripping DVDs, and playing Blu-Ray discs
* Act as a small home server for other types of files (secondary goal)

Here are the parts I've chosen:

Other considerations were I wanted a sharp looking case and have components that were new enough that they will last at least 4 or 5 years before I need to upgrade.

I want to be sure I can expand this system as time goes on and add drives as needed so the case selection has been a challenge. Spent a lot of time looking at ""HTPC"" cases but could not find one I liked that met all my needs. I'm leaning toward the [Fractal Design Micro ATX](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811352011) but I'm still considering the [LIAN LI PC-V354B](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811112300). Would like to hear any comments you may have about either of these cases.

The motherboard and CPU selection where based on making sure it met all the above goals but be as cheap as possible. I'm indifferent to the CPU being **AMD** or **Intel** based but I am partial to **Gigabyte** or **ASUS** for the MB and when I was going back and forth selecting components I ended up with Intel. The other brands were selected for a balance between quality, cost, and aesthetics ; i.e. not the most high end but not complete crap either, hence the ""midrange"".

I am still on the fence with the [Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-2250 TV tuner card](http://www.amazon.com/Hauppauge-1229-WinTV-HVR-2250-System-Builders/dp/B001E2T6Y4), my other option is the [SiliconDust HDHomeRun DUAL HDHR3](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HO58SO/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER) which has the added benefit of allowing me access to TV signals anywhere on my home network. SiliconDust is supposed to be coming out [with a new model the HDHR4 anytime now](http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/08/silicondust-announces-two-new-hdhomerun-network-tuners-with-tr/) that will have 4 tuners and be fully DNLA compatible. The Hauppauge on the other hand also has an FM radio tuner. *Decisions, decisions.*

Having an SSD is not important to me at the moment but if I ever want to add one in the future this MB has a 6gb SATA connection. For now I'll install the OS and games on a Western Digital Raptor 740gb drive I have from a previous build. I plan on installing the stock CPU cooler and case fans and see how quiet it runs once I get it put all together, if need be I'll upgrade them.

I'm not a heavy gamer so a high end graphics card was never a requirement. I'm expecting the on board graphics of the Intel CPU and Gigabyte MB will handle everything just fine. Finally I should add that I don't have cable, all my TV comes from over the air signals, I happily cut the cord 4 years ago.

My original budget was $500 which I probably could have made with Linux, a cheaper case, and less storage but this is where I came out. Look forward to reading your comments and suggestions, please let me know if you see any compatibility or functionality issues I may have missed. Thanks!

It's not ultra impressive, but it does everything we need it to do seamlessly, and more importantly automated...ly? Except for one little detail, the control part.  Lot of detail for my question, but better to understand situation and reason.

**The Setup.**

I have all my media devices in my laundry room with my servers (web and media), network panels, modem/wireless, and tuner cards. This then feeds my bedroom, patio, and living room via HDMI over Cat6 with IR extenders. My 3 main media devices are Roku, HTPC running win8, and networked Receiver. Roku handles almost all stored and streaming content, and accesses my Plex server. HTPC is running WMC hooked up to a HDhomerun tuner and acts as my DVR. Then my Receiver is an Onkyo NR515 that is my input switcher and surround.

**The last Issue.**

Everything works together great, no problems, and I have apps that control every aspect perfectly. I'm using my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 with built in IR blaster. This lets me control devices over wifi or IR when needed. The only real issue is a better way to switch apps on the tablet AND the input at the same time. First World Problem, I know.

**Possible Solution.**

At first I wanted to create a better universal remote app that would handle everything, but now realize I'd rather use all the great apps that currently work. I also don't really need to ""recreate the wheel."" I think a real solution would be for an app that switches between the remote apps installed via a hideable dock that would change receiver inputs upon focus. Simple and effective. Before I try and dig in, does anyone know of any app like this already? Homebrew or appstore? I've looked around but couldn't find anything. A lot of build up for a simple question.

**TL;DR** Anyone know of an android app that switches between apps and send an IR signal to switch inputs at the same time? Also looks good? ",,False,self,t5_2rbfy,1375809088.0,,,True,t3_1jti4o,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1jti4o/entertainment_setup_remote_the_last_thing/,

I want a small-form-factor PC with two 3.5"" SATA bays but I haven't bought or built a PC in ages and I don't know what's out there and good.

""Good"" for me in this case means a) runs a popular distro (like Mint) out of the box properly (mainly, working video and networking -- I'll occasionally log in locally to a GUI to do things), b) has two or three 3.5"" bays for SATA hard drives (optical drive is optional -- I don't need to rip things directly on it), c) gigabit networking, and d) low energy usage/low heat. I'd like decent performance when needed -- I might start getting into doing capturing or transcoding with it -- but mainly I'm interested in low energy, so I'd probably want something in the low-end Intel Core or 'i' families, but probably not as low as something like an Atom.

One thing I *won't* ever use this for is video playback. (I know, I know, never say never, but I'll mainly use this to stream shows to computers &amp; devices in the house, including a Mac Mini (10.6/Front Row forever!) hooked up to the living room TV.) Streaming mostly happens over SMB, or HTTP via Apache directory listings. Fancy, yeah. :-)  (But I still want gigabit ethernet to make bulk transfers fast, like when I load up a laptop with kids shows before a trip.)

I've owned small corporate desktops in the past (like the old Compaq Deskpro EN SFF) and been happy with them; I don't know if there's something comparable and current that I should be looking at or if I should do the newegg/barebones thing. Honestly, I'd rather buy something from an OEM if the price isn't too different -- I'm not worried about getting every ounce of performance out of every dollar spent and I don't have free time like I used to. If it's an OEM, I'll just take out whatever drive it comes with and stick in two multi-TB drives -- whatever's cheap that week -- to start. (One main drive, one for backup -- and a third bay would be nice because I could start with, say, two 2 TB drives, then add one 4 TB later when my collection has grown and prices have come down.) Thoughts?

I got this HTP around the the end of 2008 start of 2009 and it's starting to show it's age, it's having troubles playing HD videos on Youtube and Twitch.

I have a htpc case, which limits me to micro-atx motherboards, but I was wondering if I could just swap out some pieces instead of doing a complete overhaul.

I basically need this HTPC to be able to stream HD videos without issues.
Here's the HTPC's part :

-ADATA 4GB (2 x 2GB) 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 800 (PC2 6400) Dual Channel

-AMD Phenom X3 8750 Black Edition Toliman 2.4GHz Socket AM2+ 95W Triple-Core Processor

-GIGABYTE GA-MA78GM-S2HP AM2+/AM2 AMD 780G HDMI Micro ATX AMD Motherboard

-SAPPHIRE 100252HDMI Radeon HD 4550 512MB 64-bit DDR3 PCI Express 2.0 x16 HDCP Ready Low Profile Ready Video Card

-Antec New Solution NSK2480 Black/Silver 0.8mm cold-rolled steel MicroATX Desktop Computer Case 380W Power Supply

and some 640GB HDD.

I'm wondering if just changing the video card would do the trick, but I'm also thinking of getting an SSD. I know the MoBo is only Sata2, but it would still give a boost to performance, and I would not need much space on it. The Mobo also only offers a PCI Express 2.0 x16 slot, would a PCI Express 2.1 x16 video card work?

I also got a Antec Sonata 2 case, but it's guts are alot older, but it's got a 450W Power supply I can take.
I just cancelled the cable Television, so I'm saving alot and willing to spend a decent amount on this, toppping out at about 300$. This is in Canada too.

Typing is hard and often key presses don't register the first time, the range is very bad (spotty connection from about 10 feet) and the mouse optical sensor drives me nuts after a while. I do like the backlighting of the keys and the battery life. I keep this one around in the bedroom because it's the least painful to use of the ones I have.

So then I got the Logitech DiNovo Mini hoping it would solve my problems. The keyboard is much easier and better to type on and my key presses always register (while the thing is working), and the mouse does take some getting used to but I like it slightly better than the Lenovo. However, the dang thing is practically unuseable because the drivers and bluetooth connection are terrible. If you google it there are tons of problems with this keyboard. It seems like every time I use my HTPC either the keyboard buttons don't work, the mouse becomes super laggy randomly, certain special function keys don't work anymore, or the entire keyboard just decides it won't connect anymore and I have to reset it via the battery or USB dongle.

So now I'm back to the drawing board because those were two of the higher recommended keyboard/mouse combos for HTPC use that came up in my research. What are you guys using? The two that I'm considering right now are the Cideko Air Mouse/Keyboard and the Rii, although a lot of people dislike the Rii and think it's cheap. I'm still undecided how well the Cideko will work.

I've already been running Sickbeard and sabNBZd on my main PC and I really like it, which has led me down this road. I'd originally debated going the Linux route but it seems like I'll be better off sticking with Windows for WMC/MediaBrowser or XBMC.

Overall, what I want in the end product is the ability to read/rip BluRay with full 1080p and , SB, Sab, CouchPotato, Netflix, Amazon Instant, ESPN3, game emulators (all the way up to PS2 if possible, but at least PS1). 

However, I'm interested in having a large drive pool/mounted volumes in Windows for the server portion. Basically I want it to be easily expandable for both the data and the parity. This is fairly easy with Linux using mhddfs and SnapRAID (just from what I've read, never done it), but I'd like some insight into using Drivepool with SnapRAID in Windows. I'm thinking of using a smallish SSD for the OS and all the front end stuff, and then begin with a 2-3TB data drive with a matching parity drive. Then I could expand outward and have the protection to recover from a dual drive failure. Tools in Drivepool can apparently keep me informed of the health of my drives as well. This would hold all my data/media.

The big questions are what kind of hardware am I looking at and how big of a job is this? I'm fairly comfortable with setting up MediaBrowser (haven't checked out the new one yet) and all the Usenet tools, but I've never really dealt with logical volumes or any type of Raid. I'm unsure of how much horsepower I'll need to push all this either. Power draw is not a huge concern but I don't want it to be overly noisy. Any advice is welcome.

I did see a post by [frosty tech](http://www.frostytech.com/top5heatsinks.cfm) that shows the top coolers by noise and effectiveness. I am just not sure which one would work for my rig with regards to clearance for such things as the ram for example. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: After all of the advice I thinking I am going for the noctua fan for this setup. The low profile is a plus since it can be used another htpc setup in the future.

1370261323.0,5,self.htpc,1fkrdo,Update on my HTPC build,11,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1fkrdo/update_on_my_htpc_build/,"A couple weeks ago, I posted [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1ervl9/how_does_this_build_look/), seeking advice/validation on my build.  Well, the system is up and running and I wanted to share my thoughts.  Apologies for the long read, but I hope to offer some insight and real world experience for others.  

* The AMD A-5300 is working very well.  Win7 and WMC run smoothly and HD video payback is flawless with no stutter, even with an extender watching TV in another room.  I daresay the picture even looks better than with the equipment my cable company provides.  This APU is no powerhouse by any stretch of the imagination but it's working beautifully in my application, and for $50 I'm extremely pleased.

* The MSI mobo is fine too.  I usually use Gigabyte and this is my first MSI product, but it's doing it's job.  The system posted on the first powerup and the UEFI is a nice touch.  I'll definitely consider MSI for future builds.  

* For memory, I wound up going with Kingston HyperX Blue, 2x4gb, 1600mhz.  Newegg had a shellshocker deal on it so I went with it.  It's fine.  Running stable at 1600mhz, 1.65v.  Mobo recognized it immediately.

* I had the power supply and HDD on hand.  Not much to say about them.  An SSD would make the system a little snappier, but no complaints. 

* The Ceton InfiniTV 4 is pretty sweet.  Install was straightforward, my cablecard worked fine on the first try, and pairing it was simple.  I dislike their mini coax cable adapter, but I see why they did it and it works fine.  

* I did go ahead and get a Ceton Echo as well because they had a package deal that saved $50.  It's working fine after a firmware update and some tweaking of the settings.  I was ready to send it back before I did the update, and the jury is still out, but I think it will be fine.  

* Finally, since my house is not wired with cat6, I decided to try powerline adapters to save me the trouble of pulling cable.  I used Actiontec's 500mbps adapters (knowing they would be limited to 100mbps since they do not have gigabit ports) and I'm seeing a pretty stable 80mbps, which is more than enough for HD TV.  They're an ok option and super simple to setup if you're not needing a ton of speed. 

Thanks for reading.  I welcome your questions or comments if you have any.

A good quality jukebox

Decent processing power (677mhz CPU and 512mb is slow during large jukebox navigation)

optical drive would be handy, but not vital

Play all media files

* About $500-$600
* Primary function to play ripped DVDs (tired of scratched discs!), or occasionally NTSC/Blu-Ray DVD
* Secondary: Replace Roku for Netflix/Amazon
* Tertiary: Supports low-mid range PC games (e.g. stock Skyrim), maybe old console emulators

This is for a very simple home TV setup (older Sony Bravia KDL-40S5100, Sony BDP S360 &amp; Zvox 325, Roku) - nothing fancy needed for audio/3D etc.  Quiet operation for ripped/DVD playback is important, but I don't mind having a case fan kick in if its working on an older FPS.

Due to wiring constraints, this has to be wifi (Roku is currently and has no problems - I have good bandwidth and a decent router)

So - a Win7, XBMC setup looks pretty nice.  I found this [LH post](http://lifehacker.com/5936546/how-i-built-the-media-center-of-my-dreams-for-under-500) that seems to be a good starting point.  Dropping it into PC Part Picker shows it at $546 (including a few extra peripherals).

I've built an Intel home PC for gaming/coding previously, and have never used an AMD (although love my Radeon 7950!), so I have my concerns on the CPU.

What does Reddit think, is this a solid build recommendation, or can it be improved?

Edit: Clarified setup above.  Will likely have a home NAS solution within 6 mo., so local storage can probably be lower.  I have (and appreciate) an SSD on my home PC, but wonder if it's worth the premium for an HTPC (as I don't expect frequent cold-starts)

*Edit2: Revamped part list based on feedback below!*

Edit3: I just discovered this nice feature of the Roku:

 a) The Roku 2 has a free ""Plex"" channel
 b) A Synology NAS has a built-in media server

I tried this out with a quick install of a Plex server on my workstation, and it looks to be working great there.

With that in mind, I'd appreciate any comments.

I want to be able to put full rips (.VOB files; no compression) of my DVDs onto this machine and stream wirelessly to an iPad or Android tablet. The connection to the TV may be HDMI but most likely streaming as well. I should mention that my TV isn't wireless ready so I'll need to add a box that can pick up the stream (will Roku 3 do that? I should check). 

Looking at various other builds around the net I've created the machine below based on a recent Tom's Hardware one. I picked Windows 8 so I could use Storage Space, and have a large set of choices for streaming/playing (like Media Center, XBMC, VLC). I have a bias to having more memory and power than I ""need"". 

Price isn't really a factor.

Thanks in advance for your comments. 

EDIT: Just noticed that I should have an ""n"" for the wireless as well.

* **[boinxtv](http://www.boinx.com/boinxtv/overview/)** (that was 2-3 years ago) it has had a really shitty playback quality. (got it cheap in some bundle, would have cried if i've payed 500$ for it. perhaps it's also made for something else than playing back videos)
* **finalcut** works okay, but there is a (powerfull) mac and a licence required. if i remember correctly the newest version does not support video playback on a external monitor.
* **quicktimeplayer** one year, when boinxtv went crazy we just used the quicktime player. it worked but it was quit a hazzly to hide the gui elements.

as you may see, so fare we used a mac to playback the videos. this is not required. we may use a windows 7 pc (also i'm not familiar how to disable all the notifications and auto update popups). my favorite solution would be some kind of linux software.

my ideal software:

* absolutely no graphical user interface (playback is controlled via tcp, webinteraface or some other api)
* no problem if there is a 1 second lag for buffering
* simply plays a movie, when done black out screen, i can choose the next video.
* automatically changes repetition rate according to the videofile.

i've thought about just using vlc, but i think there should be better solutions?! e.g. what happens if the movie is 24fps? vlc will just interpolate to match the 60fps of the screen and not try to change the repetition rate?! (our beamer would support 30,25,24,60,50fps in 1080p via dvi)

i think we would simply convert all the films (mostly 1080p) to the right format. so i don't see a big problem here. of course it would be nice if we could play back the original files (e.g. mpeg4 or motionjpeg),..

i'm happy about any tiny information, because my google-fu let me down. thanks a lot.

 First, we're watching a movie through Plex and it keeps stopping/skipping and reloading.  From what I've read on these forums I think it's transcoding and the NAS will help this?  

Second, is there a way to skip the Roku/Plex and use a DLNA-enabled blu-ray to watch our media?  We have a POS Toshiba blu-ray right now, but would be looking to upgrade if we could use that.  Would it need a different media server to play through the blu-ray?

I'll be adding a Hauppage WinTV HVR (single-tuner) card from the old build as well for very occasional OTA viewing. 

As stated in previous post, my HDTV is only capable of 720p for gaming so I am thinking the APU will meet most of my needs at this point, if not being overkill. What I am wondering at this point is:

1) Will the Antec Basiq BP350 PSU from my current build be sufficient? Or do I need something beefier? 

2) Any other concerns spotted in the parts list? Improvements keeping the total outlay under $400?

It was suggested that I ask my question here from r/hometheater.

Here's what I'm looking to do and I don't know if it's possible:

- Install XBMC on a Raspberry Pi board
- Connect Pi's audio to stereo receiver
- Use my phone's DLNA ""Play On"" feature to send audio signal from phone to XBMC to play on stereo via wifi (from phone's media player. media is stored directly on phone)
- There will be no screens connected to the Pi board

I have no experience with XBMC and I want to know is if this setup will work without a screen for XBMC before I invest time and money into this project. 

Once it's set up, will I be able to power-on the Pi and start using the music service without having to tell XBMC to go in DLNA mode (via XBMC's UI) or something?

Thanks!

**EDIT**: I'm going to get this: [Blackberry Music Gateway](http://ca.crackberry.com/blackberry-music-gateway/9A172A11438.htm) for a few reasons: 

1) It will let me stream music from any source on my phone, not just the media player (will let me listen to songza, pandora, etc. on my stereo!)

2) I can use this in my car since it uses USB as a power source unlike other similar products

3) Since it's bluetooth it works with any phone... no it's not for blackberrys only although it seems to be marketed that way unfortunately for them 

4) It's a cheap and easy set up

5) I can leave it on 24/7 without worrying about wasting electricity, no PC server needs to be on all the time.

I'd like a system that's of course small and quiet, which will run XMBC and which I'll be able to view UK content through. I have a VPN for this last part. Today I connect to the VPN on my PC and then extend the Iplayer browser screen to my TV, connected via HDMI. The goal is that I'll be able to watch the same content without needing the PC and in a way that's easy to operate (such as using an Iplayer add-on for XMBC). I just need to make the VPN connection process transparant.


I don't today have a NAS but I'll soon have one up and running.

I won't be gaming, won't be watching 3D but will be streaming 1080p content. There's also no need for digital audio.

I had presumed that I'd just go and get a box which would do everything for me but looking at lots of forums out there is seems that building a mini-pc from scratch seems to be a popular way to go.


So what I'd like to know is if people build their own solutions so that they have full control over the final design and cost, much like why I build my own PCs, or are there very few or poor pre-built solutions out there?

**Here is my system:**

* Dell Zino HD HTPC w/ Radeon 5450 video card
* Denon 4311CI Receiver
* HDMI Connection

**Software Used:**

* JRiver Media Center (FLAC / MP3 music via Wasapi)
* Spotify (Streaming music)
* Windows Media Player Classic (mkv/avi movies)
* PowerDVD / WinDVD (Blu-ray and DVD, bitstream)

My receiver is capable of handling 24 bit, 192 kHz 8-channel. However, I want to minimize any resampling, but also want seamless playback when going from one piece of software to another.

An issue I face now is that when I use JRiver in Wasapi mode, then go into Spotify, it emits a loud high pitched whine, and I risk damaging my speakers. The music also plays incredibly slowly. The only solution is to go into the Windows audio settings, change the bit depth / sample rate to 24bit/96kHz, then back to 24bit/192kHz.

Another issue is that some multi-channel 24bit FLAC will not play without resampling in JRiver. I've also received the same resampling error if I try to play a video file in JRiver.

I basically want what I can bitstreamed to the receiver, so that includes DVD, Blu-ray, DTS audio, and some HD video files.

I was asked by some firm to suggest them a media player. This company has a couple of ferries, and in each ferry there are several screens playing their promotional videos. At the moment, there is a DVD player hooked to each screen, but they skip and it is annoying for them to update the discs.

The screens have composite video input, and as far as I know, there is no network infrastructure on the ship.

The client asks for a device that has:

- Simple interface (and a remote control) for the stewardess to start playback.

- Internal storage, preferably SSD because of the (sometimes) strong motion. They only need 8-30GB, but can be more.

- Some USB port to upload material.

They just want to attach such device to each TV, load it with their .MOV or Video_TS files and loop the playback.

I was joking with them to get a cheap old iPod touches with the dongle and tape it to the back of the TV... But I would like to come up with some options for these media box devices that seem to be popular at the moment. Would anyone here like to recommend some hardware?

I am not sure where the SSD price went. On NewEgg it is US$65.

I have built PC's in the past as a teenager with my dad and this will be my first on my own.  The part picker list is at the bottom of this post. The HTPC will be streaming mostly 720p content, but would like to eventually have it be able to stream 1080p content somewhere down the line.  I'm planning to run OpenELEC or another version of Linux based XBMC if anyone has suggestions for me to look into, I'm still new to this and OpenELEC seems like the best option.  Down the line I plan on building an unRAID server, but for now the files will be served either by an external hard drive attached to another computer in the house or locally to this HTPC, or to a simple NAS connected to the router. I could see myself maybe doing some light emulation gaming with it, but it will be predominantly used for watching video content.  Also, is 3D (connected via ethernet or locally) possible with this build?

EDIT: Forgot to mention, I need to pick out a CPU cooler but not really sure which ones will fit with a case such as the one I've selected.

I recently bit the bullet and got an HDHomerun Prime with a cable card and cable subscription and now I gotta build an HTPC for it!

I currently have a PC that I use as both as a gaming PC and a HTPC that I will be gutting for parts for this new build.

I also am looking into purchasing a NAS with (hopefully) either 2 or 4 3-TB drives in some sort or RAID (or unRAID, which I'm not familiar with but that's neither here nor there).

Ideally I would have a case that is very small with one external bay and 1 internal bay. I have an old-ish AMD Phenom xII 555 BE (unlocked 3 cores) that I plan to use as the CPU, and I want to get a mini or micro ATX case and a new mobo and discrete graphics card.

Like everyone here, I'd expect this machine to send 1080p to a receiver/TV connected to it via HDMI flawlessly. It would also serve as the main TV center (using Windows Media Center) for my apartment and for my technologically-limited girlfriend and friends, so I plan to leave it always on so that she (or anyone) can come and turn on the TV (using a WMC remote) and won't even be able to tell they are on a computer.

With respect to the NAS, I'd REALLY like to be able to have the HDHomerun Prime record shows directly to the NAS, and so that other computers and extenders in the house can access media; this is something that I've heard is not easy.

Oh, and I have no Linux experience and although I would like to learn it I don't plan to until the distant future.

Is all of this feasible?

Is it overkill to try to have an always-on HTPC? If I plan to do it like that, should I get an internal SSD to minimize moving parts? And if so, would that mean I would only need one internal bay thus increasing my options of cases?

Is it possible to have the HDHomerun Prime record directly to the NAS? I understand that if I want to see TV shows recorded by the HDHomerun Prime, my ""extenders"" (I plan on using my windows 7 laptop) would basically tap into Windows Media Center on the HTPC that is connected to the HDHomerun Prime, and I'd like the HDHomerun Prime to write directly to the NAS so I don't have to worry about space. The NAS will also store video/audio (not talking about recordings from the HDHomerun Prime) that will be directly accessed by my laptop without the laptop having to access the HTPC (right?). Any NAS suggestions? I've heard people talking about Synology the most often.

If my CPU is not enough for 1080p (currently it is paired to 2 video cards in crossfire), which video card do you recommend (again, purely playback/recording, virtually no gaming)?

What size power supply will be able to juice this?

I have AnyDVD decrypting them, and it's doing the job just fine. I'm encoding them with Handbrake into .mkv files. There are some movies, such as The Avengers and Kill Bill, that have short segments in foreign languages that are normally subtitles in English. However, Handbrake is not recognizing any subtitle tracks on my Blu-Rays. I've tried doing this two different ways. For Avengers I just had AnyDVD make an image of it which I've mounted using Daemon Tools. For Kill Bill I went in with MakeMKV and ripped the movie first, to be compressed in Handbrake later. I ripped all the subtitle tracks when I did it, and VLC recognizes the tracks just fine and has no problem switching between them on the fly.

Handbrake, however, won't recognize subtitle tracks on either movie. All I get is ""Foreign Audio Search"", which from reading on the internet is *supposed* to do exactly what I'm trying to do. However, without Handbrake recognizing any subtitles at all, it's kinda useless. Has anyone else had this problem, and how the hell do I go about fixing it?

EDIT: Did a bit more digging, apparently Handbrake doesn't yet support PGS, which is what Blu-Rays use for their subtitle tracks. Currently it only supports VOBSUB. Anyone got any alternatives?

I just found this sub-reddit (which seems awesome by the way) and have a bunch of questions regarding an htpc setup. The main purpose of this build is going to also be a small NAS that is able to stream movies at 1080p. My whole house will be connected via LAN, so wireless is thankfully out of the picture. Now for the hardware critique =)

I have a couple questions.

* 1. Is the integrated graphics sufficient enough? Would there be any advantage over an AMD processor?
* 2. Any opinions on the new WD red drives? From what I've seen and read (mostly from WD marketing) is that they are built more for a NAS type set up. Also I was reading somewhere that WD green drives don't do so hot in RAID 1, but I'm not sure if I'm remembering that correctly.
* 3. I'm a frequent lurker at /r/buildapc and they would probably internet slap me for using a cheap PSU, any reason to be worried?
* 4. What can I do with that Biostar remote?

* 1. Obviously I'm saving a ton of money with the second build, but what am I sacrificing? 
* 2. Does anyone have experience with that case? (and included PSU *shudder*)
* 3. Anything else you would edit or change?

Like I mentioned in one of the questions, I would like to set up the drives in RAID 1. Data redundancy and longevity is super important as I'm trying to justify this build to my father to help fund it for the house. A lot to read, I know I'm sorry but if someone could help me with any little bit of it I would highly appreciate it. I got no love from /r/buildapc or /r/networking. 

Last thing. Front end software clients? xmbx and plex are my leading two right now.

My plans are for a do-everything HTPC which means, DVR OTA TV, run SABNZBD/CouchPotato/SickBeard for movies and shows, music, and some light gaming ala emulators (PSX, SNES, NES) and maybe Steam. I may occasionally want to stream from the HTPC to an Android device or a couple Macbooks.

I have 5 2TB Hitachi HDDs laying around and I was going to throw 2 of them into this case in RAID 1 for storage. Or I just may go RAID1 and use a cloud service as a backup. I was aiming to come in around $500 give or take $20 and played with an Intel i3-based build before piecing this one together.

Is this build overkill for my needs? My LCD TV is old so I can't do better than 720p. I feel like this thing will do everything I want and then some. For front end I am thinking of running WMC for DVR functionality and then XBMC for everything else. I also have a Harmony 700 remote I'd like to be able to put to use. I am a little worried about going AMD as I haven't used their chips in years. Also concerned I won't be able to route the boards USB3 ports to the front of the case chassis.

Please let me know if you spot any areas that are lacking, where I might be able to save a buck, or if there is something I flat out forget. I've already learned a ton from this sub so, hopefully, I put it all to good use picking out these components. Thanks!

Hi Guys

I have been watching the Mini Android PC market intently over the last few months since XBMC was announced and have seen many devices come and go (MK802, MK802+, MK802 II, CX-01, Pivos XIOS, Oval Elephant, ect).... But so far I haven't really been satisfied with the specs combined with the whole Allwinnner A10 XBMC spat and the fact that the Tegra 3 OUYA is due early next year have put me off buying anything.

But I have come across the MK808 for around $65 and I think the specs on look very interesting...

* Dual Core Rockchip 3066 1.6GHz (heard multiple reports it's actually clocked at 1.2Ghz)

* Mali 400GPU???

* 1GB DDR3

* 8GB nand flash

* 2x USB Host (1x full size, 1 mini)

* MicroSD card slot with support upto 32GB

* Android 4.1 Jellybean

Looking at the [rockchip datasheet (pdf)](http://tabreview.ru/content/pdf_docs/RK3066_datasheet_brief.pdf) it looks like it supports neon and hardware video decoding.

Performance in benchmarks seems to put it at a similar level to the Galaxy S II and Galaxy Nexus.

So does anybody have one of these? what are your thoughts?

Does it run ok with a 1amp USB adapter (one person suggests it can't and needs a 2A, but nobody else seems to have mentioned it)

I ask because my Asus GTX580 is giving me artifacts when I play any games. It works pretty well when I'm watching movies/shows via Plex  - though sometimes the playback randomly stops, which I imagine is because its under heavy load with the HD format.

I think I need to RMA my card back to Asus, but I don't want to be without my PC for however long they take. I was thinking about buying a different brand graphics card (cheaper), but I don't really know whats good/bad. This new card will likely be a replacement for me since I don't know how Asus will handle the RMA process, they may not accept it at all.

In addition to the different numbered cards, any preference for manufacturers? Based off newegg reviews I see EVGA and Zotac seem to be the better companies.

Here's what I'm running:

* Intel Core i7 processor 3.2ghz

* 8GB of Ram (g.skill)

* asus sabertooth x58(?) mobo

* 850 watts psu

I have a 24in 1080p monitor hooked up with DVI and I have a 32in Sony TV hooked up via HDMI. I see the temperature shoots up about 20 degrees Fahrenheit because I guess the TV is natively 720p so when you have different resolutions it works harder - though I guess it technically supports 1080p?

Before I used the computer as an HTPC the graphics card hovered around 87-90F, when I plugged the TV up to it, the temperature hovers around 113F.

Sorry for the giant wall of text, figured I'd give the whole backstory. Any help you can give is greatly appreciated.

I just completed my first build yesterday. The computer runs great, but after I connected it to my TV/speaker set with an HDMI cable, my speakers began to output static, constantly. Whenever I play a movie or television show, that sound is output as well, but the static still remains underneath.

I was wondering if anyone has had a similar problem after finishing a build or if they might know what's causing the static output.

I'm particularly curious about the PSU. MicroATX PSUs aren't a breed I'm familiar with, and my go-to brands don't seem to make anything in the wattage I want (250-350 watts. I want this thing on constantly, so I'm hoping for low-draw.) 

Also, should I worry about cooling the CPU?

It would sometimes see my hard drives but generally would let me know that there was ""No Storage"" attached, even though there was.


Then, I moved to the newer WD TV Live, thinking ""Oh! It's newer, surely they have at least made it work with their own hard drives seamlessly!"". Well, I was wrong again. Just as bad and now I am out another $100.


So, what I want is a home media server that works. I want to be able to play music and video. I want to be able to play pretty much any format of video or audio. I want it to be arranged nicely and to show information about movies, tv shows, and music albums. I really like the look of the Popcorn Hour C-300's menus and how it automatically brings in album covers, movie covers, reviews, synopses, etc. but am not sure if I would just be throwing money down the drain again in terms of compatibility with my hard drives and future hard drives I may purchase.


Is it best to buy a media server box like that or should I build a pc that is a dedicated media server? The boxes are attractive of course due to the price and compactness. I can afford a media box right now but would not be able to fully afford a media center pc right now. How do I best do this? The only computer I have currently is just a laptop. I don't have a dedicated desktop at home that I could plug the hard drives into and then somehow stream to my TV. Please help!!


Please actually give me informative answers if you can. Not just some brand I should buy. I really appreciate this!!


**EDIT**: Price range would be from $500-$700 for the NOW stuff.  Price of LATER stuff is negligible at this time but if it can be added in this price range and still provide me with a very robust, reliable machine, then so be it! Otherwise I will just add to it as I can afford to.  Let me know any other questions or if there is something you recommend that I have not listed below that will make this better!


**What I need in this machine *NOW* is:**

-A sound card that can handle crisp audio (component?) 
-This machine would be located in the living room near the TV.  
-I want at least 3 USB slots but the more the merrier.  
-One or two firewire would be nice as well since data travels faster from my external HD's over firewire.  
-Bluetooth of course (or whatever would work best for a wireless keyboard/remote interface)
-I want to be able to have 720p/1080p go to my television (by way of HDMI I'm guessing)
-Ability to move files from my main home computer to this server via the home network (basically be able to always add to my library).
-I want this to generally be a keyboard/remote only server.  I don't want to have to have a mouse setup in my living room.  But if I need to use one sometimes for file management and for the initial setup, that is fine of course.
-I want a really nice, sexy user interface. I want it to auto-download movie covers, album covers, etc.  Also synopses and reviews would be nice if possible.


**What I will eventually want within the next 6 months to a year is:**

-I want to be able to eventually run high quality surround sound from this machine(perhaps S/PDIF would be more appropriate for that?).    
-I would like to be able to stream my audio from this machine to other speakers or receivers in the house some day as well (deck speakers and kitchen speakers!)
-To be able to add an internal hd or two with maybe even the option of adding more down the road.
-Maybe be able to stream content to a second TV downstairs as well for the kids. This does not have to be 720p/1080p. I guess I can use some sort of cheap box for this but I just need to be able to have this box stream out to that box.  Also, for overnight guests in our home to be able to stream from this box to their laptops or ipads would be awesome if that is possible with read-only access.

I'm sitting on about substantial collection (500+) concert DVD's in what I can only describe as 'raw format' (Video_TS &amp; Audio_TS folders) on a DroboPro and I have been starting to remastering some of these (adding  audio from DAT / FLAC sources as well as color correction; etc., as most of these are sourced from generated VHS transfers.) 

Soooo... 

Question #1:

Is there an accepted lossless video container (i.e. what FLAC is to audio)? I've been toying with both MKV, MP4 &amp; even simple disc images in ISO format, but figured that there were folks out there who know a lot more about video formats than me. 

Question #2:

Are there any forums / communities that specialize in this sort of thing, I've been on taperssection.com (live audio taping forum) for 10+ years but when it comes to video it's either taboo (footage of bands that don't allow video) or folks just don't have a good working knowledge of video (like me). 

Hell, while I'm asking... if someone knows of a good workflow for remastering VHS sourced video in Final Cut Pro that'd be huge.

By light gaming I mean steam indie games.  I mainly want to be able to play my local multiplayer steam games as well as run N64 and PSX emulators.  The most intensive game I can imagine playing on it would be Portal 2.  Not sure if a small ssd would be good for loading these as well as the OS.

For the HTPC part I'd like it to be as quiet as possible while watching media (not as important when gaming).  I'm also saving room for a tv tuner addition at a later point.  I'm not sure if recording live TV would be worth it if I use it as a seed box.  Also, if I could use it to replace my comcast box that would be great.

I plan on leaving it on all the time as a torrent box/media server.  Mostly just for streaming music to my phone or at a friend's house.  It will be on pretty much constantly.

Here is my [current build](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/8cFD)

I think that psu should cut it for this particular setup.  Not sure if I need a better cpu or gpu.  If I do I'd likely need an ATX mobo to accommodate a larger psu. I have an alternate build for that since it also needs a different case.

I have a had a PS3 for a couple years that I used as a way to watch downloaded stuff on my TV. I had issues streaming that never seemed to work out. Recently I have been just using a USB drive and plugging it directly to the TV to watch an episode or so. Also, I recently cut the cord on bought a OTA antenna that is great for when I catch a couple sports games (which I would like to record, but I am in between a hd homerun and a hauppauge).

So, I am looking for a machine that will automate downloading TV and Movies for me. The biggest thing I want is to be able to watch 1080p TV shows and movies without having to worry about if my network will support it. I figure the best way to do that is with a HTPC that has local storage. This requirement makes me weary of building a NAS unless someone can convince me otherwise. I would also like to be able to watch Hulu and Netflix, but those are secondary demands. The software will be Plex or WMC, I haven’t done enough research to decide. I will be running SabNZB and sickbeard as well as torrents.

Is there anything I am missing? Should I wait for the Ivy Bridge CPUs to come out (better graphics, lower power?)? I may add some fans, but I want to build it first and see what the layout looks like. I have heard I might need a low profile heatsink, but I will wait on that as well. Also, I am unsure of what bitstreaming audio means. I have [logitech z-5500](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-THX-Certified-Digital-Surround-Speaker/dp/B0002WPSBC) speakers that have 3 3.5mm jacks in, 1 optical in, and one digital in. Ideally I would use the optical for the ps3 and the 3 3.5mm jacks from the PC. Is there any issue with that?

UPDATE:
I went ahead and purchased the HTPC. I made a couple changes and probably overspent, but I am fine with that.

 I SHOULD be lowering the receivers volume but it is annoying to keep the remote control here or frankly to even pick it up if I am doing other things. My Foobar Hotkeys are way more convenient.

SO... **Why can't I find a USB powered IR blaster that can control my Home Theater equipment?**

Something simple that I can just program or teach the IR codes to my equipment so my in-windows volume control keys are now hotkeys to lower or raise my receiver's volume. I can think of about fifty awesome reasons for something like this. Say I start a video in MPC-HC. I could throw a macro out to set the receiver to Surround instead of Stereo or turn on my TV.. When outputting a surround encode strait to a receiver you lose all windows volume control as well so anyone with a properly set up HTPC must be experiencing this too.

So am I crazy assuming this doesn't exist and I just can't find it?

http://www.zotacusa.com/products/mini-pcs/zbox?limit=all

i would prefer to add in my own ssd and ram, so i guess mainly i would like to know which is the best cpu/gpu combo that Zotac offers.

i also would prefer to keep my media local on portable hard drives. i'm not really a fan of streaming from my main pc. i may even want to keep certain things on separate hard drives as well. like movies on one portable drive, and tv series on another. is this going to be a problem for XBMC?

also, i'm not opposed to building my own box, so i'll gladly consider recommendations for that as well if you think that is the better route to go. but the most important thing to consider is that it must be super quiet. i think my PS3 Slim is far too loud as it is.

I've been doing a lot of research on HTPCs and NASs and am trying to find an optimal setup. I have a lot of devices I'd like to be able to stream to and have the ability to connect to storage - apple, android, ps3, tvs. I guess the biggest question is do I really need a HTPC, NAS, both, or hybrid? I'm a recent cord cutter, so I have the usual sickbeard/couchpotato/etc setup. Along with that comes a need for a lot of storage and transcoding ability. Transcoding is where the real problem is. With the need to stream to so many devices I think I may need more horsepower than just a barebones NAS. Part of me says HTPC (wait for ivy bridge :D) with a small SSD and dedicated GPU for transcoding and grunt work of cable cutting then a barebones NAS for storage. Another part says just combine the two (eg HTPC with a ton of storage) and use ATV, ps3, etc for serving media.

Keeping them separate is nice, since I like delegation of work to be clean cut. Also, getting something like Synology would make all the different platforms play nice together for storage and low power usage. Or I could roll a custom NAS with Solaris or FreeNAS. Then again keeping everything together has its perks too.

Currently I'm using XBMC and Windows 7 for most of my work. I'm not opposed to using a different OS or different software for anything though. Plex, Boxee, WinServ 2008.. yadda yadda

I've upgraded a few components and today tried to add a simple TV Tuner.  However I'm getting video stuttering, freeze ups and out of sync audio.

I bought the [Pinnacle PCTV 80e HD Mini Stick](http://www.amazon.com/Pinnacle-PCTV-Mini-Stick-23058/dp/B003NUDZVA).  I chose this one for two main reasons - 1) I just wanted a simple tuner to watch OTA TV and 2) most of the other tuners out there seemed built for Win 7 with Media Center.  I'm running WinXP SP3 and since this was a little older it seemed better designed for my system.

My current config:

* 1.8 GHz Processor
* Win XPSP3 (not MCE)
* 4 GB RAM
* Asus 1GB video card ([EAH5450](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121447))
* 1 TB WD external drive
* Pinnacle PCTV 80e
* PC TVCenter Pro 6.4 (DL'ed most recent version from website)

**Synopsis of issues:**

Video will play just fine when I first open the app.  This may be for 10 seconds or 5 minutes.  Audio is out of sync half the time.  If I change channels it always starts to stutter immediately, after changing a few channels it freezes all together.  I also tried setting a recording as I saw that suggested on another site, that didn't work - the entire recording is a frozen screen.

I searched the knowledge base for this issues and followed their (Pinnacle's) [directions to run this on a slow PC](http://www.pctvsystems.com/tabid/62/default.aspx/Knowledgebase/tabid/231/language/en-US/Default.aspx) to see if that would help, even though I don't think mine would be considered slow for an HTPC.  [Here are my settings](http://i.imgur.com/E30ZJ.jpg) in the TVCenter app.

I also checked CPU usage and it jumps from about 17% - 30%, not sure whether or not that is considered high usage for this process.  [Here's a pic](http://i.imgur.com/clCyj.jpg) of all usage data with the TVCenter Pro running.

Any suggestions to fix this?

Is their an aftermarket viewer I could use?

In searching Google I found a reference to MythTV and using that in XBMC.  If I read correctly on their site I haveto download the files then compile them from C++ to... something.  That's way beyond my scope of abilities.

I finally got my HTPC up and running, but the last item I'm getting stuck on is my wireless keyboard/mouse. I just bought a [wireless keyboard/mouse](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823217019) from CompUSA today because it was the only one with a mouse built into it and it was on sale so I grabbed it. It works, but only seems to work about 6 feet from the pc. It says it's supposed to work up to 30 feet; I only need it to function roughly 10 feet away. Should I just return it since it's useless to me at the moment, or is there a cheap way to increase the strength?

I'm not interested in USB extenders or trying to solder an antenna to the keyboard. I don't have any AAA batteries on me at the moment, but I've heard replacing the stock ones with new, brand names one may help. What do you guys think? Or is there a better one that ya'll would suggest, that's around the same price (~$40).

1330465553.0,2,self.htpc,qa9my,"In the home stretch, and I need a nas. unRaid is expensive, but I'm willing. OpenMediaVault is hard for me to understand. I know dick about linux. someone help. I need guidance",6,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/qa9my/in_the_home_stretch_and_i_need_a_nas_unraid_is/,"So here's the deal.  I have several brand new 3tb drives.  I have several 2tb and 1tb drives that I have laying around.  I have double digits of 250gb to 500gb drives laying around not being used.

I have set up a gigabit network, and I want to save my library to a nas.  

**disclaimer: I know NOTHING about linux. Have no desire in learning. **

The PC i'll be using is a semi-old duo-core 2.4ghz with 4gb of ram.  Nothing special.  Has 4 sata ports on board, and I have a pci card with 4 more sata ports.  I have room for more sata cards to add too, down the road.**

Here's what I want to do: 

* 1) I want to be able to have 1 location. I dont want a separate share for each disk.  i want just one location showing the entire array as what I have for available space. if I have four 3tb drives, than I want it to show I have 12tb free. (I understand that unraid uses one drive for parity.  I'm not saying I want all drives available for space. I'm just using the example that I want one network share showing however much space I do have, as one location.  (9TB free, or whatever)  **edit: am I correct that unRaid doesn't allow one giant volume?  Each disk is it's own share?  2nd edit: nope. You can access all of your drives with one share. unRaid is looking like the only option**

* 2) I want to be able to add space easily down the road. With media libraries, it's never enough, and since I have so many different drives, I need whatever system I have to be able to use any drive and add the available space from that drive to the total available space.  ie: if i have four 3tb drives for space, and my network location shows 12tb available, and I add 1 tb to the mix, it should now show 13tb.  Not 2 separate locations or whatever.

* 3) please understand, the four 3tb drives I have right now will make up the main part of the NAS right now, but I literally have 10-15 other drives I could add, that are just laying around.  It would be stupid to not use them, so while it's not super important, I need the ability to use any size drive, different types of drives, and all that. 
then, in the future, I pull out one drive, and add a bigger and I lose no data.  I'm not interested in obtaining 12tb of data all over again. 

* 4) it has to be easy to set up.  I've been messing with unRaid, and following tutorials, and I have it set up with a basic license right now, but I set the wrong disk as the parity drive (I have 3 Seagate Barracuda 7200rpm drives, and one WD 5900rpm and I set THAT one as the parity. I read that I should use the fastest drives for the parity drive) so when i try to change the drives around it says missing disks, and I dont know what to do. I have no data on any of the drives right now, so maybe I should preclear the entire array again (another 37 hours) and just start over, but it's such a pain in the ass. i just want to get this thing up and running. i've been playing with it for 2 weeks and can't figure it out. 
Also, I have another 3tb drive that currently has my entire library.  I figured once I set up the NAS with the current 4 drives, I could just copy the data from the 5th drive to the array over the network, then add the 5th drive to the system, giving myself another 3tb.  if there was a way to just pop the 5th into the array and add the data that way, even better. 


so heres what I've done:  I have a sytem dedicated to plex media server, and another system dedicated to sabnzbd, couchpotato and sickbeard.  If I could run sabnzbd, sickbeard and cp on the nas, that would free up a computer for me, but it's not super important.  The reason I bring it up, is unraid has an easy way to add sabnzbd via the unmenu gui.  I need super easy ways to add the shit I need. OpenMediaVault seemed to set up easily enough, but it woudln't identify certain drives with file systems already on them.  It uses raid I believe, and I dont think it's as easy to add drives later down the road, but I might be wrong.  their help wiki is lacking, to say the least.  And the only way to add sab, cp and sickbeard was through actual interfacing with linux, as opposed to using the web gui.  If someone was to help, I'd be able to get through an installation in linux, but understand when I say i have ZERO grasp on linux, and even less of a desire to learn it.  I just want to set it and forget it, and maintain it through a web gui.


unRaid is expensive as shit, and the license is tied to your usb guid. 

If your usb drive breaks (where unraid is installed) you have to buy another copy. You can't just email and ask for another key.  

I couldn't find any way to pirate it, so i could at least test the pro/premium installations.  I'm perfectly willing to pay, but the idea of paying and then their pro installation not working the way I think, or them forcing me to pay again if I used the wrong guid, or if my usb thumb drive dies is really not something I'm interested in.

I'll do it, if unraid is the only way for me to go, but I really REALLY would at least like to get a key for cheaper, or have them willing to honor a refund, or even a new key down the road.  Hell, if I could pirate it, I'd be willing to pay extra after I got it set up, since I'd know that IF MY KEY DIED IN A WEEK, I could get it back up and running without paying them another $200 bucks. 


**tl;dr: unRaid is probably the only way to go, right? OpenMediaVault is relatively new, and I tried it, but it requires a bit more linux knowledge than I have, at least to get it up and running the way that works perfectly for me.   Also, I'm unclear on how expandable it is in the future.  As I understand it, OpenFilier and FreeNAS are not expandable, but maybe I'm wrong.  help me /r/htpc. Please. **

**edit:  my friend said just enable raid and run that with windows, but I KNOW that's not the best option for a media server, since more people don't do that with their htpcs.  I just...i'm so frustrated and on the edge of insanity, that I could cry as I type this.  I just want it to be fucking done and done without me having to worry about my lack of linux knowledge down the road.  arrlasjsfd;lajfl;ajsdfl;sja;lf**

I'm running a HTPC inside a Silverstone Grandia GD05B case. The videocard in it is about 4 months old, Asus ENGT430 1GB. 

When I first bought the card it was silent, absolutely no noise from the whole machine but unfortunately in the last few weeks I'm hearing a ""grinding"" sound from the box.

After checking through all the fans i've narrowed it down to the crappy little fan on the GT430 heatsink, im not sure whats caused it but its definitely that fan. 

I;ve tried oiling the bearing, to no avail. I also tried running the card without the fan connected but I get lockups &amp; reboots when watching 1080p .MKV's with a high bitrate.

I have also emailed Asus requesting a replacement fan however their response was ""we dont suppy the fans, try Amazon"". The part number for the fan is EFB0412HHA however the one supplied with the card is different in that the ""chassis"" of the fan seems custom made to fit in the GT430 heatsink.

What else can I do about this? Any way to underclock/undervolt the card to still allow playback of 1080p content but not have the card heat up as much? Should I try re-applying the TIM?

1327948447.0,4,self.htpc,p3aj5,"My 3rd generation HTPC upgrades this weekend, amazing how far some technology is coming",4,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/p3aj5/my_3rd_generation_htpc_upgrades_this_weekend/,"First off every time I have replaced a motherboard and do a major upgrade I call it a new generation.

Generation 1: HTPC playback was using Beyond TV software, a tv card to record video, some shitty old programs to sort the data and play back. DVD playback was done through Powerdvd.

Output was RC jacks to speakers, and s-video. This was later upgraded to a discrete video card for VGA playback.

Used a HTPC case with black finish and it was super heavy.

This computer last from 2004-2008 -&gt; 4 year life span, not bad for the cost vs. use. Only thing added was a video card so the overall cost was less than $750 for 4 years.

Generation 2: Same case as Generation 1, replaced everything to handle blu ray and 720p and 1080p content.

Case was replaced after the faulty power supply was replace by the manufacturer.

Second Power supply (these are custom in shape so I had to use there's) went when the computer shut off at random. When I went to turn it back on the side of the case flew off (plastic fan attached to the metal case), and the PSU caught on fire.

The wife came out wonder what the gun shot sound was I was standing them with a oven mitt on trying to rip the PSU out as it was on fire, and I had burn myself trying to get at it the first few minutes.

I wanted to save as much of the computer and not burn the place down, so I was able to pull out the some what on fire PSU while saving the motherboard.

So what happen? 

I had a friend look into this, while the machine was running the PSU fan died and start to overheat +100C as the capacitor had started to melt. When I tried turning it on again several of the capacitor exploded.

I informed the company of there PSU issues, then refuse to look into the issue.

So I stopped by cases from them.

So a new case and psu that wasn't custom I got off kijiji for less then $150 bucks, got a nice Silverstone LC16M, and a good PSU from a guy.

Over the four year's this system had a few upgrades such as 8Gb of RAM, a HDMI video card that could handle bit streaming (In 2011 I had bought a Onkyo 5.1 sound system to handle hi def sounds).

A lot of storage was added as movies and tv show kept growing in size.

Used Windvd Pro 9 through 11, and XBMC for the software. 

Stopped paying for TV in 2010, as I have everything download at this point, but still buying blu ray and dvd disc's.

Basically at the end of it's life span I start to use usenet to automate my downloads, and everything is self sorting.

This computer last from 2008-2012.

Basically this machine was still running good but was running into various issue.

The P5K board that bough in 2008 was hitting the four year mark, and was having hic ups and glitches playing back 1080p video with high bit rates.

It always had heat issue but it seemed to get a bit higher even with monthly cleaning.

The onboard lan went funny on the P5k board so I had to stuff a PCI GB lan card in to fix that issue.

It didn't support ACHI without a cross firmware class from P5KE, so SSD support was limited.

Either the motherboard or the PSU was having issue as I was no longer able to turn the machine off, if I did it took forever to jump start it to work again.

So it's almost the second month in 2012. Figured it was time to put some real money down buy good parts this time and hopefully it will last.

So memory express was having a good sale on for my replacement parts that I need and the third generation HTPC was born!

Generation 3:

Same case Silverstone LC16M

Replaced motherboard, cpu, and ram.

Core™ i5-2500K
Gigabyte GA-Z68A-D3H-B3 
Patriot Gamer 2 Series, Division 2 Edition DDR3 8GB Kit
Enthusiast Series TX750M Modular Power Supply
OCZ Vertex Plus Series 2.5in SATA II Solid State Drive, 60GB

Cost: $477 + 30 bucks for in store product replacement.

Really nice set-up for less than $500 bucks.

Best part is I spent better part of ten hours rebuild the entire system.

The video card has been removed and so has the lan card.

As the Core™ i5-2500K and Gigabyte GA-Z68A-D3H-B3 have HDMI out using the Intel HD 3000.

Using Windvd Pro 11 for blu ray playback it runs smooth, xbmc works great with that Intel card.

Also the Intel card does bitstreaming without hacks compared to my old flawed ATI 5770 that required a EDID override.

So basically I ripped out half the parts and replaced it with just a new motherboard, ram, and cpu.

In return I get a cooler and quiet HTPC, and it only runs at 35C-40C under load compared to 60C+ before.

Plus my HTPC runs 24/7 so I figure this will save a bit on the powerbill.

But I find it amazing my first generation computer I used on board s-video as it support direct 9.4c as I need that for the program's i was running.

Then I went to using video cards to handle playback etc.

Now I'm back to a onboard video that can handle HDMI 1.4v and bitstreaming without a issue.

Having a HTPC has costed a bit over the years, but it's been almost ten years, and having to replace the parts three times it's that bad.

I think the main issue in the past is my budget was tighter so I have settle for lower end parts.

Now I think I have that solved I think this current setup will be fine for six or seven years.

1327644921.0,4,self.htpc,oytcj,Anyone using an HTPC and intending on using Windows Media Centre with their tv tuner will experience this,4,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/oytcj/anyone_using_an_htpc_and_intending_on_using/,"One of the major problems I found using windows media centre to watch TV is the unexplainable delay it takes to go from windowed mode to full screen. I mean seriously anyone that's ever used it for an extended period of time will know how frustrating it is copping a good 2 -3 seconds of black screen and no sound just to get in or out of full screen. If you're using 2 monitors the problem doesn’t stop there, once full screened, the mouse will then be stuck on that monitor unless you use the windows key to free it and incur the inevitable stutter, not to mention using the windows key leaves the taskbar visible if you’re using your primary monitor or are using ultramon to extend the taskbar to your other screen. Using the Windows Key+Shift+Left/Right to swap WMC between monitors also is not the smoothest experience.



HOWEVER all is not lost. I found a very interesting fix for ALL of the above problems: 

1)	Open windows media centre in windowed mode (if using a 2nd monitor make sure it is on the primary one with the start button 

2)	Go back to your desktop, right click and go to personalise &gt; screen saver

3)	Set any screen saver to come on in 1 minute

4)	Go back to windows media centre in windowed mode and make it the active window

5)	Wait for the screen saver to come on

6)	Hey presto, windows media centre will now full screen instantly, will not trap the mouse when full screened in a two monitor set up, and will also swap between monitors smoothly without the stutter


I have reproduced this effect countless times on multiple windows 7 machines, give it a try yourself.


It will unfortunately revert back after you close it so I pretty much have to do it every time I know I’m going to be watching TV for a while.

I was curious if you guys had any idea as to why this behaviour occurs or any solutions for a permanent fix.

First time posting here. I took a look at the media server guide on the sidebar but I have a few questions about a htpc setup.

I currently have the following rig, which I use mostly for gaming:
- AMD Phenom II 925 Black Edition
- Palit 2GB GTX460
- 8GB DDR3 Ram
- SSD (mainly for OS)
- Two additional 7200rpm HDDs
- Gigabit ethernet

My first question is, do you think I would need to build a separate media server to host all my tv shows/movies/recorded tv and such or would the one I currently have be enough to host it and eventually stream it to my xmbc setup on another room?
The rooms are all connected via ethernet cable.

My setup, just to give you an idea, would be having the media server on my room and then have something else on my living room streaming all the content from the media server.

Second question would be, do you think I would need another pc on my living room to read the content or would an apple tv (or anything similar) be enough?

I plan on streaming 1080p content as well.

Hope this is enough information for you to help me out but please feel free to ask anything.

Any help is greatly appreciated!

All media was stored on this PC until recently, where I built a NAS and moved the movies/tv shows over. Now that my media is in a central location, I'm wondering if I can use an old PC as the media server and downloader so I can free up my main PC a bit. (As a side note, I dont want to use the NAS for anything but file storage at this point. I may expand that in the future.)

The old PC is a gateway with a amd x2 3800, upgraded to 4gb of ram and a new gt610. My original plan was to use this box as the HTPC for downstairs, which is why I upgraded the video card and ram. From the research I've done, I know it would be able to stream 1080p. The real question is if it could handle a Plex server streaming to 2, possibly 3 sources in the house at once. It would be a great plus if it could also  download shows, movies and process files. I'm just wondering what limits I'd be facing before I make a decision. If it's too weak to stream to 2 clients at once I'll keep it as an HTPC.

I'd like to avoid a cable/satellite subscription, so streaming is the route I am looking to take with local content, Netflix, and possibly other options. My SO likes several stations such as HGTV and TBS, so I'm not sure how I would go about getting those (Hulu+ has them, not sure of alternatives). Basically the only thing I watch is anime on my computer that I download via IRC. It is usually 720p .mkv, so that would be the main item to serve. Eventually I could see ripping blu-rays and whatnot. As for storing these, I have never dabbled in the NAS scene, but I am thinking this is the correct route... if not, please let me know.

With that, I am not looking for anything fancy on the NAS side. I will probably just buy something from Synology and slap in some WD Reds.

Now the main question... how do I go about streaming this content to my desired clients? I'll have multiple televisions throughout the house, but I can't see more than 2 being used at once. Does a Roku w/ Plex meet my streaming needs? I understand it can't really transcode, but will I need to transcode? What about Raspberry Pi?

I imagine a HTPC would be nice, because I can then use XBMC (or equivalent), but my only concern is the fact that I will probably have the need for several media centers. A complete setup (HTPC + TV + sound system) for each of these will be pretty pricey... Or would I just need one acting as a media server of sorts to provide for the whole house?

Basically... I am confused and need to know my options. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

As a troubleshooting step, I could try plugging a PC monitor into the HTPC, but that's REALLY inconvenient and doesn't fix anything by itself, it just gives me another troubleshooting avenue. Before I do that, does anyone have any idea what could be going on here?

UPDATE: I have an HDMI-to-DVI cable, so I was able to hook up a PC Monitor to the HDMI port on the HTPC. It works fine. When I plug in the monitor and the AVR+TV at the same time, Windows does detect a new PnP monitor and identifies the AVR like it always has, but doesn't know what resolution to set. Resolution is greyed out under windows and set to 1024x768. (The TV is usually 1920x1080 @ 60hz) I tried a different port on the AVR (the known good input) and I tried a different HDMI cable from the PC to the AVR with no change in behavior. Next up is to plug the PC monitor into the HDMI output on the AVR and see if I can pass HDMI through that way from the HTPC. It's worth noting that the cable box plugged into this AVR works fine.",,False,self,t5_2rbfy,1371769627.0,,,True,t3_1gqel3,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1gqel3/odd_video_problem/,

So, short background: here in the boonies, for years we could only get satellite TV and internet (capped at 10 GB/month data). Now that we have access to fiberoptic rural internet, I want to transition my dad onto an HTPC as cheaply as possible. 

**Primary uses**: Netflix, Hulu, FreeCable/other similar streaming options. Eventually, some ripped DVDs/etc. from a harddrive plugged in, so ability to play 1080 HD files without stuttering via USB would be great. **ZERO** gaming.


I'm looking into a jailbroken ATV, but I do happen to have an old HP Pavilion a1245c I'd love to repurpose. If I can upgrade it for less than $100, I'll go for it. Here are the specs:


&gt;**Computer**: HP Pavilion a1245c

&gt;**HD**: 200 GB 7200 rpm IDE drive (*definite upgrade)

&gt;**OS**: Windows XP SP3 (if I can use this with XBMC, GREAT; I'd like to have Netflix. If not, I'll go Linux)

&gt;**CPU**: Athlon 64 3700+ 2.2 GHz

&gt;**GPU**: Integrated (*definite upgrade)

&gt;**RAM**: 2 GB 184-Pin DDR SDRAM DDR 400 (PC 3200)

&gt;**MOBO**: MSI MS-7184 [specs here](http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c00399477)

&gt;**Chipset**: ATI Radeon XPress 200

&gt;**PSU**: Something cheap and loud, 350W

Would these specs work for running an HTPC? If so, would love suggestions for super cheap GPU and **quiet** PSU. If I have to upgrade CPU/RAM, it may be cheaper to just build from ground up.

If this works, I'll build him something slicker in a nice case down the road, but right now, saving money is key.

It supports DPL2 decoding with a compatible audio receiver. No receivers here though, just an HTPC with some old Creative 5.1 speakers hooked up. There must be a software solution somehow out there, so we looked.

It took a while, but finally we found something that works. Here is the software you need.

GraphStudioNext - Sound mapping and routing.
PowerDVD 6 - DPL2 Filter
FFDShow(optional) - DPL2 Filter, good alternative.

You will also need a mic in 3.5mm port to feed your console's stereo signal. Line-in might work too but there isn't one here so we used mic-in. We use a stereo rca to 3.5mm stereo adapter to hook it up.

Install your filter either PowerDVD 6 or FFDShow. Open GraphStudio and insert you mic-in clicking Graph, then Insert Filter. First select capture sources in the drop down menu, double click your mic to add it. Next select the direct show filters from the drop menu and double click either cyberlink audio effect or ffdshow audio processor. Finally add your speakers output from the audio renderers drop down. You should close the graph menu and save the graph at this point.

So now you have these 3 boxes on your graph area. Double click the mic-in box to get it's menu. Click on the Latency tab. Give it a value of 10 and click set. You may have to raise this if you get skipping or lower if you can and want to. Next double click PowerDVD or FFDShow. Find the dolby options and turn them on, in powerdvd you have to also pick 6 speakers or however many speakers you have, it's automatic in ffdshow.

Now connect the mic out box to the either powerdvd or ffdshow in. It should auto connect the filter out to your speakers but if it didn't do that. So now all are hooked up, click the play button and this should give your sound. Make sure your mic volume is turned up a little, too much will cause feedback.

You can enjoy full 5.1 sound in games like RE4 and Rouge Squadron 2. The results are pretty good and a stereo dolby pro logic 2 encoded wav was tested and it played all 6 channels respectively.",,False,self,t5_2rbfy,False,,,True,t3_1gfllq,http://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1gfllq/software_dolby_pro_logic_2_decoding_using/,

The server will be an ESXI server with Windows 7 running on one VM, with a Ceton InfiniTV 6 (haven't decided between the PCI-e or external box), with all my current media saved to NAS.

My end goal is a single box that will receive streams of live TV from the Ceton card/device to my 2 TVs, pull up DVR recorded shows, pull up my currently saved movies and TV series, and tie in with Hulu/Netflix/whatever else I am wanting to use. I want a single box for uniformity sake. I have used Plex before with great results, but it does not (as far as I know) integrate with Live TV. XBMC seems like it does, but I haven't seen anything about how WELL it combines everything - and I would have to find some small PC or device to load XBMC onto for each TV that will perform all the functions. And WMC will do the Live TV, DVR, and my saved media - but I know I will end up converting a LOT of my media (such as MKV files) since they're not supported - and I don't know if Netflix/Hulu/etc tie into a Windows Media extender too well (like the Ceton Echo).

I have had my setup for over a year now. I use usenet with sabnzbd, sickbeard, and an unraid server. Last week, I tried to update sickbeard through the unraid server menu. It didn't update, and it caused the unraid server menu (tower/main) to constantly say ""waiting on tower..."", though I could still see the server on my network.

I had this problem a year ago (to the day!) and I fixed it by removing the flash drive and running a check disk on it. I did this again, and it seemed to work. However, when I turned sickbeard back on, it happened again.

I decided it was okay because I never use the unraid menu anyways. The next day, the server shut down and will not start back up. I did the flash drive thing to no avail. I then reformatted the flash drive, and now the server will not even boot up.
