I was contacted by a lady who was looking for artists to collaborate with on her startup. She asked if she could use one of my images as a background on her upcoming website. Of course I wanted to get a little more information about her startup and her intended use of my image before entering into any kind of agreement, so I asked her a few questions. She responded by telling me that if I say no, she'll just use it anyway by modifying it just enough to avoid having to pay me for it.

[maker]",18,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/o4v9f/its_not_much_and_it_doesnt_pay_my_bills_but_it_is/,"Though there are an elite few on Etsy who make a pretty decent living and are madly popular, most others are like me. Etsy does not pay my bills. Maybe it never will. And, if you're considering opening an Etsy shop, it's something to keep in mind: you'll probably spend more money than you make.

But, there's more to it than money. My art is my passion, but my shop has become my *dream*. And, dreams are worth a lot, as corny as that sounds. When I was a teenager, I used to dream about boys and my grown up life, visiting Europe, going to college, and being the coolest girl alive. But I'm grown up. I'm done with college. I'm married. I've already adopted a dog and me, the mister, and the pup already have a house (and a mortgage, obviously). I'd love to travel more as I go along, but I've been lucky enough to get to see a lot of far away, exotic places. And, I've realized that being cool doesn't really matter very much. All of these things make me happy and content. But, dreams are *exciting*.  I'm so fucking stoked to have found something else to work towards and hope for.

Also, having a shop open to the public makes me try much harder to become a better artist. Making shitty art is fine but it gets a bit embarrassing when the internet is watching. So, I try harder. And, as a result, I've improved a ton in the last year or two. I still have a long way to go, but I'm happy as long as I'm making progress and a few paintings here and there turn out pretty.

So, that's my take on Etsy. I just wanted to put it out there since I've seen a lot of brand new shop owners in here. I hope your shops are successful, but remember that there is more than one way to be successful.

Good luck and godspeed.

I have purchased so much on there and have friends with stores. I purchased an item from a very popular store and this is how it went down:

- **05/07/2012:** Purchase made for $303, promised delivery in 9-10 weeks
- **06/14/2012:** Requested feedback for my profile as I paid immediately. No response
- **08/10/2012:** Requested update as item had not marked shipped and 12 weeks had passed.
- **08/10/2012:** Seller responds, apologizes and says they had a rush on the item and they're behind on orders. Will be an additional 4-4.5 weeks. I respond saying as long as it will be shipped in 6 weeks, I'm OK with it and understand.
- **09/30/2012:** Requested update. No response.
- **10/10/2012:** Requested update. Received an email (not Etsy message), that they had two family deaths within three weeks and ""all that that involves"" and are hard at work to fulfill orders. I offer condolences and say I don't need a hard date, just a rough estimate. I also point out that it looks like they are fulfilling orders for other shop items purchased after May. They respond that they hired someone to do the SMALL orders and ensured that my LARGE order will be done in the order received.
- **12/20/2012:** I ask for update as it shows that a LARGE order made in September was fulfilled and my May order still outstanding. Receive a copy-paste letter detailing their woes - they got behind, too many orders, we are bad business people, leaving it up to the Lord, etc. And that the September order I pointed out was because someone left negative feedback and they did a ""kiss and make-up"".
- **01/06/2013:** I offer condolences and ask for an update as to when I can expect my order. No response.
- **03/19/2013:** Pointed out that according to feedback, a customer who ordered in October received their item. Seller responds that ""if you must know"", the customer ordered BEFORE me, but made final deposit in October. And they're still working on my order.
- **03/30/2013:** Request an estimated time of delivery. No response.
- **05/27/2013:** Pointed out that two more LARGE orders have been fulfilled. Blatantly requested a refund of my $303 as I have not heard a single thing since March. Also messaged them on Facebook, and registered a PayPal dispute (even though the deadline has passed).

Honestly. What can I do? They promised everything until the very second the dispute resolution deadlines for both Etsy and PayPal had passed and have wish-washed me around since. They continue to send out SMALL orders every week so I know they're alive. Just ignoring me. Do I out them? They have been featured on HGTV, Pinterest, etc. Hence the popularity that seems to suck for only me.

Mine are:

1- Buying too many expensive crafting supplies at the beginning and not looking around for better prices like I am now.

2- When I started my soap making, I spent far too much money on supplies, then realized that I needed to start from scratch because of Canada's 2cm slot mailing rule aka Canada Post's ""Slot of Doom"".

3- When I first FIRST opened, a year before my 'official new opening date', I was completely clueless and did not know about stat checking, advertising, and I basically lost some money from posting listings &amp; having zero sales altogether.",,False,self,t5_2qq24,False,,,True,t3_18h2mb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/18h2mb/discuss_what_are_the_3_biggest_mistakesregrets/,

I feel like the fat girl who's tried every diet plan and nothing works.

I'm active all over the place for social media and promotion.  I make treasuries, I belong to teams who feature me back in their treasuries.  I've tried blog features, giveaways and contests.  I completely redid my photography for my shop, and took DOZENS of hours earlier this year to re-edit all of my listings so they looked what I thought was pretty perfect.  I comb my listings just about once a week to try and make my keywords and titles better....

I just don't know what else to do at this point.

1347239580.0,19,self.Etsy,zmo2k,[Discuss] My fiancé is planning on shutting down her shop due to poor sales... any advice I can give her?,19,0,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/zmo2k/discuss_my_fiancé_is_planning_on_shutting_down/,"She opened her shop around May/June of 2011.  Sales were slow at first, then a few months of pretty decent sales, but since then, she's been lucky to get one sale a month since January.

I've tried giving her advice on promoting, and to be honest, she didn't really need the advice cause she was doing everything I could think of - Facebook, Twitter and that thing you do on Etsy to make your shop more relevant.  I even posted a couple links through here.

She says she's closing it, and put everything in her shop 50% off for a couple weeks and is just going to donate the rest of the stock eventually.

I just feel so bad.  This shop meant a lot to her, and it was very creative and she's put countless hours into it.  I don't want to spam reddit, nor am I planning on posting a link - this isn't a ploy to get people to go to the shop.. 

I just want to know what you guys have done when sales really sucked and hope seemed lost.  I know there has to be some of you like her, who have poured your heart into your products, only to see the return less than desirable. 

Another note.  In the last few months, someone opened a shop almost completely identical to hers.  Almost 100% the same products, materials, shop description (sorta) and even item descriptions!!! She was upset, but ultimately respectful and welcoming, WAY more than most people would be in that situation... I, on the other hand, was livid when I found out and wanted to report the 'etsy police' on this shop owner.. However my finace explained that this sort of thing happens a lot.  This shop has also had a good amount of sales since it opened, eclipsing her shop.

So yeah, I just feel like I don't know what else I can say to her to keep this little dream alive.  She's trying to think of a way to drastically change it, so she's still donating profits (oh yeah, she donates 20% of proceeds to animal shelters... that other shop doesn't)

I just don't want her to close down something she loves if there's anything else we could do beyond facebook, twitter, buying search ad's, sales, etc.
Thoughts? Advice? Thanks in advance.


[EDIT]
Since I made this post, we've talked a bit and she's decided that instead of just completely shutting it down, she's gonna try to refocus.  This means donating whatever of her current stock doesn't sell and focusing on creating different products.  It's a good thing, yes, still kind of tough watching knowing how much of her heart she's put into this.

I will feature you and your article on my site, and then blast it to 170,000 Pinterest users.",19,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/1h5z8u/request_send_me_a_link_to_your_shop_and_a_diy/,"I know that a lot of people are really into NOT using Pinterest and get super upset when they see people DIYing their products.  THIS POST IS NOT FOR YOU.  Just back slowly away, thanks.  
  
For those of you who aren't threatened by Pinterest and/or people figuring out how to do what you do, I have an offer.  
  
Make a sort of basic intro to whatever you do/make.  Or a related DIY project.  E.g. you sell bottle necklaces with little putty characters in them, but write a general article about using putty to make tiny characters.  
  
Or just a 400-800 word description of how you do what you do.  As an avid Pinterest user- I can say with confidence that maybe 0.00001% of people will actually attempt the project.  The rest will see how AWESOME it is and jump on over to your Etsy shop (I hope- haven't tried this yet).  
  
Provide me with some nice pictures, your short description, and a link to your shop.  I will post a ""feature"" of you and your product with the article on my website, and then pin the whole thing to 170,000+ Pinterest followers.  
  
I have done this with my own webpages before with great success, and I also offer it as a fiverr gig and so far the response has been great.  Traffic to a GOOD picture or pin is through the roof.  I don't know how much of that will convert to traffic to your shop, as I have never attempted this before.  However I am extremely aware of how many people consider Etsy spamming to be ...well... spam.  It's hard to get an Etsy item repinned, but easy to get a DIY project repinned.  Especially when you start by blasting it to over 170k users.    
  
**So that's my offer- anyone who'd like to take me up on it, shoot off a PM or comment here.**  
  
The last one I pinned resulted in a quick traffic bomb, then a slow decline.  E.g. First day 300 new visitors, 2nd day 350, 3rd day 250, 4th-8th 150~, and now I'm still hovering around 30 per day from just that one Pinterest blast.  Imagine that many people seeing your product and being interested enough to click over and read about it!  
  
If you check out my fiverr account feedback, the first buyer got over 2,000 unique visitors total from my blast.  The 2nd one reviewed after only 2 days (grr I specifically ask them to wait) and said he got over 500 unique visitors so far.  
  
If you need picture help, I'm definitely here for you.  I want this to be a mutual effort for mutual gain.",,False,self,t5_2qq24,False,,,True,t3_1h5z8u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/1h5z8u/request_send_me_a_link_to_your_shop_and_a_diy/,

I recently opened my etsy shop selling jewelry (http://www.etsy.com/shop/kitchies). My first sale came in and I prepared the earrings, shipped them off and waited anxiously to find out how my buyer liked them. I've made earrings for myself, friends and coworkers and they've held up well, but as luck would have it, the buyer messaged me saying that one of her earrings broke within the first two days she had them. 

I offered to replace them or give her a refund, and she said she'd prefer a refund and expressed her disappointment. I issued the refund immediately and messaged her telling her I was still going to send her a new set, because she was one of my first sales and I wanted to provide her with a product that wouldn't break. She sent me a nice message back, and I think the situation is resolved and (hopefully) won't result in negative feedback.

But now I'm looking for advice, since I'm new...

Have you had a similar situation? How did you handle it?

Have you ever a purchased an item that broke soon after you received it? How did the seller handle the situation?

If you do get a negative feedback, what is the best way to bounce back?

Any tips from those who have had similar experiences would be much appreciated! I was so disappointed that my first sale went this way and don't want to be discouraged about my luck or the future of my shop.",,False,self,t5_2qq24,False,,,True,t3_17ccg1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/17ccg1/discuss_how_to_deal_with_sales_gone_wrong/,

She says she has made and sent them three different times. On occasion one will get returned to her but sometimes she says she has to remake the items by hand and re-send them when I tell her I never got them. Her feedback on the site is 100% positive and she has 900+ responses, so I'm on the side of trusting her. Here's the biggest problem: In the beginning I offered to pay for insurance to track the packages but she said it was too expensive. It's possible she didn't realize I was offering to pay and instead thought I wanted her to pay. Now a year later she is out of the fabric for the items I wanted, they are somewhere in the great mail system between Australia and the US, and she's asking me if there is something else in her store that I would like instead. Even if there was something else I'm afraid it's just going to get lost in the mail again and I was willing to pay the extra $60 for insurance for the original items, but not anything else she has in her store. Please help! I have no idea what to tell her and I'm afraid to ask for my money back at this point because, if she's been completely honest and so nice as to believe me, then the poor women will be out the shipping.

There was a post about having more than just promotion around this subreddit, and I agree. If we are going to promote our shops, let's at least have some fun with it and get to know each other :)

So here's the premise of this post: if your Etsy shop was a brick and mortar (an in-person shop), what kind of music would we hear while shopping? Maybe there's a certain genre, band, artist, decade, whatever. You can be as general or as specific as you'd like. Really look at your shop and decide what music would add to the experience of your shop, not just what your favorite music is (though that helps). Be sure to leave your shop link so we can put your answer in context!

I'll go first..
If my shop Itch for Kitsch (www.itchforkitsch.etsy.com) was a b&amp;m, you'd likely hear some Vampire Weekend, The Strokes, The Avett Brothers, Ida Maria, and Regina Spektor. Kind of all over the place, but then so is my shop!

What about you guys?

Here is what's crippling me: an overwhelming sense of dread about negative feedback. So far I haven't gotten any, but with orders picking up I'm getting more and more nervous that someone isn't going to like something for whatever reason and then I'm doomed. 

I've heard some real horror stories from a friend of mine who sells online professionally. My shop is just an amateur side business, but I'd like it to grow into something more one of these days. 

Is there anyway I can prepare for negative feedback? Is a shop doomed if it has just one red notch?

I've been lurking here for a while as I am an avid Etsy browser/shopper, but this is my first post. 

I just opened my Etsy shop [Modern Folk Vintage](http://etsy.com/shop/modernfolkvintage) and I was just wondering what your first impressions are upon looking at my shop. Of course my mom, SO, and friends all have nothing bad to say - but I need the honest truth and I figured strangers would be willing to give it to me.  Anything is appreciated, good and/or bad! 

Also, I created a new user/shop name for this shop, though I have another one that I've done all of my purchasing through, therefore my new shop has zero feedback. I would love to know how important feedback is to you as a buyer. If you see zero feedback, does it deter you from purchasing? If so, is there an appropriate way to refer a hesitant customer to another account to show them positive feedback? Does that even matter if, say, 80% of that feedback was from me as a buyer, not seller?

If so, there are a lot of import/export laws, particularly when dealing with animal and plant materials. If you get caught violating some of these laws in the US there are serious consequences, even if you weren't aware you were violating the law. We're talking huge fines and possibly jail time here. At the very least you risk the item being confiscated by customs, and that is not how you keep your customers happy on Etsy!

Here's a few links relevant to the import and export of animal products, useful if you're selling vintage fur items, exporting animal products, or use fur, bones, leather, feathers in your work.

Now, on to Italy. I do not ship to Italy, because everything I have ever sent there has arrived looking as though it has been folded in half and stomped upon. Their postal system is notoriously unreliable. They also have some bizarre import prohibitions, some of which are as follows:

* Haberdashery and sewn articles of any kind, including trimmings and lace; handkerchiefs; scarves; shawls, needlework including stockings and gloves; bonnets, caps, and hats of any kind.
* Hair and articles made of hair. 
* Human remains. 
* Live bees, leeches, and silkworms. 
* Nutmeg, vanilla; sea salt, rock salt; saffron.
* Playing cards of any kind.
* Toys not made wholly of wood. 

This is pretty much the extent of my knowledge of import/export laws as they apply to me and my store, but I am hoping that some of you out there have more knowledge that you would be willing to share with the rest of us. I JUST started shipping internationally myself, and do not want anything I send out to be confiscated in customs or never arrive due to a shoddy and unreliable postal system in the country in question.

So lets discuss -

* Where do you ship? 

* Where do you not ship? 

* What precautions do you take when shipping internationally?

* What import/export laws apply to what you sell?

My shipping policies are mixed - animal parts and products are US only, everything else can be shipped internationally. Inexpensive items that I can replace/refund if lost in the mail get sent First Class/First Class International, but more expensive items require Registered Mail. I do not ship to Italy under any circumstances. When shipping internationally I pack the same as when shipping to the US, but with more tape and more tissue paper.

What are others doing?,13,3,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/vmkmf/shop_stagnating_with_very_few_or_sometimes_zero/,"I have a pretty decent time selling niche, novelty stuff on one of my shops (necklaces and keychains using gaming dice). It does fairly well and I've more than broken even on it. Every sale now is money in my pocket. Sadly, pocket money is about all it is, but that's still nice to have. :-)

On my other shop, which I consider to be my more serious shop, I'm having trouble driving views. I think a lot of it has to do with not really understanding the ""mainstream"" jewelry market. I'm not a beader, really. I'm not a metalsmith quite yet. I'm something else. I'm not sure where to advertise, how to advertise, how to penetrate, and my advertising budget is.. not much.

I tried Etsy ads and as most have said on here, they're not great. I've tried Google Ads and they weren't much better.

I'm beginning to think that I'm going to have to rely on local shows, networking, and word-of-mouth. Is that what people generally do...? I'm in one gallery in a very limited capacity right now and don't have a huge number of prospects for more. 

Need some pointers. :)

1367431152.0,11,self.Etsy,1dhtib,[Question] - Is there any way I can get scammed by doing this? (As a seller),12,1,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/1dhtib/question_is_there_any_way_i_can_get_scammed_by/,"Someone tell me if there's any way I can get scammed with this:

Posted something I made on Etsy. User contacted me and asked if they could pay by money order. I said that's fine, but they'd have to mail it to me first, I'd cash it, and then ship out the item. They said OK and asked for my address. 

User just created the account today, has no picture and no purchases. 

This is my first sale so I have no feedback score and it seems a little iffy that someone would trust me to just mail the cash to me. 

Am I going to run into any issues or risks by doing this? Just want to make sure I'm not setting myself up for some scam I'm not aware of. 

EDIT: In the last half hour they've asked for my address 3 times.... 

EDIT 2: This is too weird. So, the item is a bra that's part of a rave costume. I'm wearing it in the picture. The only info in the profile is that it's male. So I searched the username in the offchance that it'd come up elsewhere. Turns out this guy has a bunch of creepy, sexual comments on youtube videos of girls in rave gear and stuff, with the same username. 

So, either I'm going to get stalked, or he's going to use my name to sleuth me online... or he's gonna buy it and sniff it. CREEPYYYYY. 

EDIT 3: Told the guy I'm not comfortable giving out my home address and would rather do it through etsy.... he came back and offered me well above asking price for it. Also told me it was for his girlfriend. Something's weird here...

I figured I should look at tutorials on how to apply it to my black hair when bam, the girl in the video pulls out a 36 piece set that included the same colors I had just bought except they're called ""soft pastels"" and said it was $5 at Micheal's (Which is pretty much the same as Jo-Ann). Then I started looking at all the shops that sold hair chalk, and all the chalk looked exactly the same, some where broken up to sell as samplers. These sellers had over hundreds of sales!

Now don't get me wrong, buying supplies and selling supplies, sure fine.  Isn't that what vintage sellers do with apparel and other items. Also, I know not everyone has a craft store near them, but they are even sold at wal-mart. But they are selling as handmade without even mentioning any sort of ingredients or process.

Sorry for my rant. I just thought that this can't be right.

I could never do a 50% off sale in my store. My margins are running too close. I'm charging enough that I can comfortably compensate customers when their order gets broken in shipping, but if I were to even think of of 50% off sale I'd be selling below cost.

Maybe I'm under charging, but when I see sellers listing the same $150 clay chess set that looks like a cross between Mr Bill and Doctor Who I can't help but think that maybe the problem isn't the buyers. (Okay, that one was a bit personal. That seller isn't on here are they?)

I've done a series of staggered trades with other folks on Etsy for various items in my shop and built a good relationship with a few other users, but I thought I'd give r/Etsy a whirl and see if anyone here would be interested in anything in either shop [here](http://www.ragepaints.etsy.com) or [here](http://www.oakwoodleaves.etsy.com).  The best part about trading through Etsy is that cost is minimal, and it's easy to ensure that you receive the incoming item in your trade by using ""Other"" as payment and leaving each other feedback.  I used trades frequently early on with my setup of my second shop (Oakwood Leaves) to boost feedback and credibility within the Etsy community.

Another wonderful part of trading baked goods is that if you pick something from my inventory, it's easy to do an even trade by just baking X amount of cookies/brownies/whathaveyou you feel is a fair trade.

Almost a year ago, my mom decided to open up an Etsy store to sell some of her jewelry. She's been loving it, constantly making new jewelry and started doing craft fairs and going to the farmers market. She loves reddit and will start to tell me about the things she's read, only to have me cut off with ""Yeah, I read that this morning."" Anyway, because of the support she received, she wanted to say thanks. 

She recently cut the prices on all her jewelry by 25%, but was more than happy to cough up an extra 15% if you use THXREDDIT. Or, since we all like choices, you can use FREESHIP to get free shipping. Thanks again Reddit!

I've heard from some family members and friends that my prices are too low, that people will think it's inferior because it's not expensive enough etc. However, these are people that frequent art shows and craft fairs where people are willing to spend money. I feel that the internet is very competitive and raising prices would kill the small amount of business I get.

The materials I use are permanently-colored copper wire, sterling silver wire to wrap and Swarovski crystal bead accents. I've looking into upgrading to full sterling silver wire for the body of the pieces, but sterling silver wire is crazy-expensive and I would have to charge way more than I feel I would be successful selling. I have also looking into silver-plated wire, which is also more expensive, but might be a material I move to in the future. I currently pay about $9 for ~24 feet of wire. Silver plated runs about $11 for only 10 feet. I've also considered buying both and offering the silver-plated as an option for my custom pieces.

Any suggestions about pricing?

What to do?,10,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/uyy8m/shop_owner_not_standing_by_her_store_policy_what/,"So, I ordered some necklaces for my bridesmaids off Etsy at the middle/end of last month. They were a colored pearl necklace and judging by the pics and description, they sounded great! I emailed the shop owner to see if she had more necklaces than the one listed; she said they could make more for me. After reviewing her shop policies (and seeing a policy on returns), I ordered the necklaces. Waited a bit and never heard from the shop owner, so I emailed her asking if she had sent the necklaces yet. She finally said that she had the necklaces made and had enough bead for a pair of earrings and that if I wanted to wait a few more days, she would be getting more beads to make two more pairs of earrings free of charge (mind you, I only ordered the necklaces but was pretty excited about matching earrings!). So almost 2 weeks ago I got the package. Opened it up and while the necklaces were very pretty, they didn't match the dresses like I thought they would (the pics made them look a little darker than they were instead of the seafoam green that they really were). So, according to her store policy, she wants happy customers and if the customer isn't satisfied, to contact her within 3 days of receiving the package to work out an exchange/return. I emailed her the very next day saying that the color is just enough off that they won't work. No response. So I emailed her again this morning and just got a response back saying that all sales are final and those necklaces were ""perfect."" Also, she ""had to make me 2 extra necklaces and the earrings to match"" (even though I never asked for the earrings; she volunteered them for free). 

So I guess my question is an I screwed out of $75 because she doesn't want to stand by her policy? I kindof reviewed Etsy earlier and it looked to me like they try to stay out of these types of things. Does Etsy or PayPal step in and help in these situations or am I going to have to try and sell these on EBay or something to try and regain some money?

I was thinking it would make her feel better if she could sell some handmade stuff.

I know very little about etsy, so I am asking:

* Is it an appropriate place for selling such things? 
* Is the competition fierce? Does she have to be really good to sell?
* She lives in Eastern Europe, is that a problem for shipping?

If you have any recommendations/advice, please share.

Can Reddit help?",16,6,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/pb8vl/gf_lost_her_job_were_trying_to_make_it_using_etsy/,"Her shop (vixensempire) sells funny greeting cards. It was created shortly after getting laid off from a job 2 years ago. The company she worked for recently folded but her Etsy shop has taken off this month (valentines day). What can she do to cut costs further or increase sales?

So far we've been able to increase the quantity of supplies purchased. Installed CISS on her printer [1] http://www.inkjetfly.com/product_info.php?cPath=194&amp;products_id=272&amp;osCsid=dbb090d09c71fc357e8125647b35c871

We've shopped around on all her inputs to find the best supply, quality/$. This includes shipping envelopes, business cards, cellophane wrappers, and gift envelopes. The only thing we can't seem to find a better supply of is the card stock.
[2] http://www.envelopes.com/notecards/a7-folded-card-70lb-bright-white

the price recently went from $85 to $130 for 1000 cards. We've been buying in quantities of 2000+ for our recent cost cutting crusade and we're hoping to find a cheaper source and have been unsuccessful.
We're also trying to streamline production. Where I think we can save the most time is the shipping envelopes. Right now we're printing graphics and return address on 50 or so envelopes at a time. Then printing stamps at stamps.com on avery paper. Then copy and pasting from Etsy to print the mailing addresses. Then we get to apply the stamp and address.

Stamps.com has a batch function that interfaces with Etsy but I can only get it to print package mailers... not envelopes. If it worked it would be both a huge time saver and a money saver on the avery labels.
I (accounting/business grad) have done some cost spreadsheets, some potential profit goals, and have made several cost cutting gains. At our modest goal we save $109/year for every penny saved. $547 for every nickle saved per card.

Valentines, Steak and BJ day, and Mother and Fathers days are her big sellers, after that there is a big slump. What other cards would you recommend? I've already talked her into making an arbitrary day card!
Lastly, How can we drive more traffic to her site. We've registered her domain name and forwarded it to her Etsy. She has a somewhat well followed twitter. Shes worked hard updating search terms. Kept an eye on what key words bring people to the store. and have paid to have our products featured with certain key words which pays for itself 4 times over.

We have a ton of ideas for new cards but I'm concerned too many would bury the better selling items.

Thanks Reddit! And Happy Valentines Day!",,False,self,t5_2qq24,False,,,True,t3_pb8vl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/pb8vl/gf_lost_her_job_were_trying_to_make_it_using_etsy/,

So first I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Jordan and I am a 20 year old, print making student. As well as loving art, I have a deep interest in insects. Currently I am selling unmounted beetles, customizable beetle shadow boxes, real beetle jewelry, and other custom items as a way to gain money to support my own beetle collection. 

What I would like to hear from you guys is pretty simple. after looking at my shop http://www.etsy.com/shop/beetlebuy what do you guys think would appeal more to viewers and what kind of custom things would you yourself be interested in seeing?

I really appreciate any advice and will be happy to answer anyones questions if they have any!

Thanks,

set up in memorandum of my Aunt.",8,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/x5hds/fan_remembering_tuesday_a_crafters_etsy_shop_set/,"Hello Reddit crafters,

My Aunt and Cousin have set up an etsy shop in memorandum of their sister and mother, (respectively) Laura Foster of Tuesday Market. 

My aunt was tragically taken from us this last May. Besides being a wonderful mom, grandmother, and aunt, she absolutely loved Etsy. She loved arts and crafts, and developed a passion and a skill for making beautiful things. I think that aside from her children and her animals, her Etsy shop gave her a sense of purpose and fulfillment that she had not otherwise found. 

Since her passing, her sister and my cousin opened an Etsy store, taking her Tuesday Market name and changing it to Remembering Tuesday. This has given her daughters and her sister some comfort in continuing something that Laura loved, and I think this is a wonderful way to honor her memory.

They sell crafting supplies, stamps, card making and scrap booking materials, and lots more. If this is something that is up your alley, it would be great if you could check it out.

I was talking to a friend who has a soap business not on Etsy.

She says that if I want to sell ANYTHING, I need public liability insurance. I don't have much money as it is and I certainly don't have the money to get insured.

Surely there are a lot of sellers who want to make pocket money through knitting, sewing, candle etc making and don't have this type of insurance.

Is it REALLY neccessary to have this insurance? Is my friend just trying to put me off? I've sold photography prints on etsy and didn't have insurance.

I'd be really interested in hearing from sellers without public liability insurance and what kinds of products you sell.
