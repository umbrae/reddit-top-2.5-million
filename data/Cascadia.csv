Does anyone remember how the Tea Party started?

I was there, right at the beginning.  The Tea Party was a new movement, fresh and truly grass-roots, and it was galvanized by opposition to the Federal government bailing out the failing US auto industry via massive transfers of wealth in the form of tax dollars.  The Tea Party was a reaction against this.  It caught on quickly, and the cries for change started to strengthen.  It was also a truly bipartisan group; it didn't matter whether someone had an R or a D after their name; the Tea Party opposed the bailouts and would work against anyone who supported them.

But then the Right saw this thing happening; this new movement that was neither in their pocket nor that of the Left. So people like Glenn Beck and other right-wing conservatives (calling themselves ""libertarian"" without a hint of understanding the meaning of the word) ran to the front of the parade and pretended they'd been leading it all along.

And it worked.

Other conservatives joined the movement and started calling themselves ""Tea Partiers,"" and soon the clean, clear message of ""we oppose the bailouts"" became muddled up with other messages; messages that just happened to match right up with standard right-wing talking points.

This was a problem for the primary message of the Tea Party, because when you change ""we oppose the bailouts"" to ""we oppose the bailouts and immigration"" or ""we oppose the bailouts and welfare"" or ""we oppose the bailouts and gay marriage,"" you start slashing away at the population of people who would otherwise support your cause.  All the people who also oppose the bailouts, but who don't oppose immigration, or welfare, or gay marriage, soon decide that the Tea Party isn't the place for them, and they leave.  Meanwhile, your message becomes more attractive to a smaller, more partisan group of people, so over time, the original tea partiers left and were replaced with more or less extreme-right Republicans.

The Tea Party now is just a branch of the Republican Party, and isn't taken seriously by anyone on the outside, because it's simple message of ""no more bailouts"" ended up co-opted, diluted, and eventually lost in the morass of partisan politics as usual.

...

Remember Occupy Wall Street?  They, too, were against government bailouts.  Except this time, they were co-opted by more standard left-wing issues, like student loan relief, abortion rights, and strengthening unions.  And Occupy went down the exact same road as the Tea Party, but on the other side of the street.  Now it's a small, vocal group of extreme-left activists, who nobody takes particularly seriously.

At their inception, the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street had *exactly* the same outlook on what needed to change.  They were natural allies.  But by adding more and more extraneous ""wish list"" items to their respective messages, they destroyed any chance at appealing to more than a tiny percentage of the population in the long run, and both movements withered away and became worthless.

...


So now here we are, with this Cascadia thing.  The core message is this: we are far better suited to govern ourselves, and to decide our own fates, than people in New York or St. Louis or Atlanta or Houston or the District of Columbia are.  A lot of people can get behind this message, because every day gives us more and more evidence that this is overwhelmingly true.

But many of us are still trying to drag the idea of Cascadia down that same, futile path.  We don't just want self-determination; we want self-determination and wind power. Or we want self-determination and free health care.  Or we want self-determination and high speed rail.

And every time we add an item to our wish list, we slice off a group of people who might otherwise be our supporters, our activists, and our legislators.  Every.  Single.  Time.

The **only** way Cascadia will ever be anything more than a tiny Internet debating society is to grab that one pure desire; the thing we can all rally behind.  **We have to make the case for self-determination, and leave everything else out of it.**

Unfortunately, thanks to Citizens United and a Congress that is 90% in the pockets of transnational corporations, it's become clear that the chance has passed.

This is terrorism.

http://news.yahoo.com/romney-elect-house-gop-wreck-economy-192105183--politics.html

The GOP literally held America hostage in 2011 and they're threatening to do it again soon even though it's constitutionally illegal. What a bunch of scuzzy, dirty thugs; they are willing to compromise the entire American economy for their own personal gain. This is absolutionist nationalism and historically this type of toxic environment never ends well for the people living in those countries.

Romney already cheated the primaries so there will probably be some voter fraud to get him elected too. It's ugly shit like this that makes me think that an Independent Pacific Northwest or West Coast wouldn't that bad. Cascadia used to sound like a joke to me.. But more and more it really sounds like the only way to go.

If the rest of the country wants to justify:

* blind nationalism
* complete abuse of the constitution
* money as free speech
* denial of climate change
* dis-belief in modern science
* destruction of women's right to own their own body
* complete coercion of the state by the fossil fuel industry
* a broken patent system
* an unstable, poorly regulated banking system that encourages corruption... 

Let them... Cascadia would be better off on its own.

They can deny climate change and keep rebuilding the eastern seaboard every year due to continuing northerly hurricanes.

They can scrub the toilets of their royal 1% overlords and call it patriotism while us on the west coast build software, airplanes, renewable energy systems and solve real world problems. And we will do it without living an abject poverty for the benefit of the elite few.

Now I **DO NOT ADVOCATE VIOLENCE** to win our freedom; nor do I encourage the push for Independence if the federal government actually becomes progressive enough to fix the corruption problems.... But, if/when the US, and consequently Canadian economy, defaults and industries fully collapse.... Then yes, strong regional power with ethical laws and transparent decision making... That's what we will need to escape the mess the monarchs of the East coast have made for us.

I also think if the US defaults, most of the country will transition to a total military police state very quickly. Leaders in the PNW need to pass legislation NOW as precaution against this.",,False,self,t5_2s4dh,False,,,True,t3_12mq48,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/12mq48/the_gop_is_literally_going_to_threaten_america/,

Chuck, of the beer blog the [Barley Mowat](http://barleymowat.com), called them out on this asshattery. Since then it's been a social media war on all things Steamworks. You can help!

As of yesterday, Steamworks replied to Chuck claiming that they did us all a favor by trademarking the name (to protect it from big-beer corporations) and now they're doing us an even bigger favor by leasing out the name for $1. The letter is [here](http://barleymowat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cascadia-trademark-response.pdf). 

Chuck's newest post does a great job of summing up why this isn't good enough. We are putting some pressure on Steamworks but we need to continue. Send them a tweet, post on their facebook page. Post on your own facebook page to get others to join in. This is an important point to make if we want to protect our microbreweries' ability to call their beers Cascadian and continue showing the world that Cascadians care about integrity, quality, and community. 

Who's interested in teaching Eli of Steamworks what the term Cascadia represents?

**Place:** 1717 Pacific Ave, Room 3100 Tacoma, WA

**Background:** On March 11, 2007, during an anti-war protest at the Port of Tacoma, nine people were arrested on a public sidewalk for wearing backpacks in a ""no-backpack zone."" Since there is no such thing as a “no-backpack zone”—not even in Tacoma, Washington—the arrestees were charged with disobeying an officer in the duty of directing traffic. The city of Tacoma pursued the cases for one-and-a-half years. After the cases were thrown out of municipal court, the city appealed in superior court and lost again. The ACLU chimed in: Hmmmm...this is suspicious and smacks of Civil Liberties violations!

Now six of the former defendants are suing the Tacoma police and the city of Tacoma. The trial begins on January 7. Please come and support the Backpack 6!

**PLAINTIFFS:**
* Charles Bevis
* Phan Nguyen
* Liz Rivera Goldstein
* Thomas McCarthy
* Leah Coakley
* Patrick Edelbacher

**STARRING IN THE CASE OF:**

McCarthy et al. v. Barrett et al.

**REPRESENTED BY:**

Attorneys in conjunction with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)

**IN THE COURTROOM OF:**

Judge Ronald B. Leighton

**DATE:**

January 7 to January 17 (Mondays–Thursdays only)

9:00 am to approximately 4:30 pm

**LOCATION:**

The Tacoma Courthouse
1717 Pacific Ave, Room 3100

1348795757.0,37,self.Cascadia,10lgyj,A Veterans Reason for Cascadia,45,8,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/10lgyj/a_veterans_reason_for_cascadia/,"It has recently come to my attention that a bill to provide increased living wages for disabled veterans has been blocked anonymously by a republican senator. For me this is completely unacceptable and is in fact one of the reasons I wish for a free and independent Cascadia.

I know there a lot of people here who probably don't understand how I connect the dots with this one so I will try my best to explain. I served four and a half years in the US Army which included a year long deployment to Afghanistan in Kandahar province. As a result I now have permanent tinitus, hearing loss which is slowly getting worse and I am comfortable enough to admit that I have PTSD as a result of seeing combat as well as the constant fear of losing limbs or having my life snuffed out by an IED. Since coming back I have received some support from VA services which are increasingly harder to gain due to the flood of people getting out after the war in Iraq ended. With the war in Afghanistan supposedly winding down I expect these services only to become even harder to obtain.

I stopped going to my mental health appointments at the VA hospital in Spokane because they were being scheduled a month and a half between each other. I receive some compensation for my tinnitus and I am awaiting word on whether I will also receive disability for PTSD. I do receive post 9-11 GI Bill benefits but it is often slow going. For example I failed Summer quarter because I did not have the money to buy my books even though I attended most days of the whole quarter. I received my check after the quarter had ended.

I am thankful for what has been provided to me for my service to the US however it is still not enough. Especially when measures to provide veterans jobs or basic needs are constantly turned down in congress in the wake of the current political atmosphere. If a country cannot, or WILL not provide for those who stick their neck out for them then how can a country provide for its civilians?

However interestingly enough this isn't just held to politicians or slow, cumbersome government agencies. Ever since coming back and getting out of the Army I have been treated like shit and have seen other veterans treated in a similar manner. So many people have been keen to place yellow ribbon stickers on their cars or to repeat the slogan ""Thank you for your service"" but in the comment sections on an article about veterans unemployment they basically say ""fuck you!"" I've even been accused of feeling ""entitled"" to services and benefits that I argue I earned. In a recent battle with the court system, my service was actually used against me and I was labeled as ""dangerous."" This started less than a year after coming back from Afghanistan and every time my deployment and its effects on my mental health was brought up it was dismissed and I was treated as bad as a domestic criminal.

It is my hope that Cascadia will treat its veterans with the dignity and respect that they deserve irregardless of an individuals personal feelings about the wars they fought. I hope Cascadia will have a robust and responsive system for helping its veterans, something that the US currently lacks. I believe much of this is because there is not an understanding amongst the general populace of what war can do to a person. I understand there are many here who would ask ""why did you go fight an imperialist war?"" but I would like to see comments focus on the present and the future rather than the past. I have my reasons.

Like I mentioned above if we can't help and provide for out veterans the services they need then how can we do the same for the whole of the people? There is a lot of anger amongst the veteran community over things like this and it could turn out to be something like the Bonus Army back in the '30s.",,False,self,t5_2s4dh,False,,,True,t3_10lgyj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/10lgyj/a_veterans_reason_for_cascadia/,

(And other ideas),47,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/10nacq/cannabis_for_cascadia_and_other_ideas/,"The way I see it, and as I've noticed many other people point this out as well, the first step to Cascadian independence/autonomy is to work on setting ourselves apart from other regions culturally, economically and politically. People have suggested personal things to do to help the movement (eg buy locally) but I would like to see more community projects here. What this movement needs to do is get started working on smaller projects -any projects- that will help build more of a sense of community within the movement as well as the region.

One big issue at the moment could really help our cause, and I think many people here support it. That issue is the legalization of cannabis, on the OR and WA ballots, and enjoying some recent BC support as well. It's important to consider what this would actually achieve in Cascadia: 
Firstly, this shows our willingness to oppose the federal government, setting us apart from most of the country (and world) on this major taboo issue. It would be a shining example of our Cascadian ideals of free-thinking and personal freedom.
Second, it's no secret that the cultivation of cannabis is a huge industry in Cascadia, and this would help us achieve greater economic independence by legalizing it.
Finally, working together on a tangible project, such as this one, will make the movement itself stronger, bringing everyone together through collective action.


This is just my suggestion, we can pick a different issue, but I think this is something with a lot of support within this movement. Community and environmental projects/issues (or even a massive Cascadia-wide tree planting event) could also bring people together.

Other ideas/opinions?

One more thing: This movement seems to be very decentralized, with mainly local chapters creating small events. Unless I've overlooked it, I haven't noticed any big Cascadia-wide rallies. I understand this works well with many peoples' ideal of anarchism/small-community in Cascadia, and I'm not saying we should appoint some great leader to run the whole thing, but if we could unify a bit more, we could rally a lot more people and focus a flood of support on a few carefully-chosen issues.",,False,self,t5_2s4dh,False,,,True,t3_10nacq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/10nacq/cannabis_for_cascadia_and_other_ideas/,

Are there some like minded people here on reddit who would like to meet up for some coffee meetings in their cities to have discussions on what to do and how to go about doing it? I am willing to work with a Seattle group. Anybody out there want to represent their city?

I think the first item to address would be the formulation of a comprehensive platform with regards to big, medium, and specific issues. From there we could share our results from each city group, further hone and deliberate, then actually publish a trans-cascadian formal platform. 

Edit 1: for anyone wanting to join a Seattle meeting, here's a doodle poll to help us figure out the scheduling side of things.

http://www.doodle.com/wrta2ayqfmtfkvbc

It is very easy to organize a Doodle poll and I highly suggest that anyone outside of the Seattle area interested in getting a meeting started contact your local Cascadians and Redditors to start a meeting. I will try to post the minutes and discussion points from this upcoming Seattle meeting once it has occurred. Cheers to all and good luck!

-Spelling. ""Colour""? ""Color""? ""Practise""/""practice"" or ""practice"" only?

-Joining both ferry systems to become UNSTOPPABLE. With BC ferries' fleet and Washington ferries' ridership, both corporations will surely benefit.

-SI units and either Kelvin or Celcius would probably make the most sense. ThinKMetric!

-In my own personal opinion, I think the tree in the middle is quite ugly. No offense, but all I can think of when I see the flag is poop smears.
 
-Portland as a capital? I think that's a bit odd. Seattle and Vancouver have more people. Also renaming Vancouver BC would be silly considering how you can merge Portland and Vancouver together if you must insist on having Portland as a capital city.

-Consider a constitutional monarchy as opposed to a republic? It'd be weird having a republic with an area called BRITISH Columbia inside of it. Also, joining the commonwealth might actually make people take us more seriously.

In case you're unfamiliar, permaculture is a system of design principles based off of systems theory and applied to ecological and social spheres. 

The core tenets of permaculture are:
Care of the earth: Provision for all life systems to continue and multiply. This is the first principle, because without a healthy earth, humans cannot flourish.

Care of the people: Provision for people to access those resources necessary for their existence.

Return of Surplus: Reinvesting surpluses back into the system to provide for the first two ethics. This includes returning waste back into the system to recycle into usefulness.

 Folks from Windward Sustainability Research Center near Klickitat, WA are offering a really affordable permaculture course Sept 6-8th. Generally, permaculture courses are about $800-$1000, so do understand this is a particularly skookum opportunity. They want people to learn this - not just the ones who can afford it. 

It's highly recommended. They've also offered some materials and videos ahead of time in case you're worried about not getting enough out of the weekend.

In short, it is a link without much context.   The [population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Washington) (taken from well sourced wikipedia entry) of many of those counties are very small with the land covered being very large.  Let's take a look at Lincoln county as a comparison.

Now, they receive well over double for each dollar they pay in taxes.  However, there is only a little bit over 10 thousand people in the entire county.  For the sake of simple maths, let's say everyone in that county pays 1 dollar in taxes.  That means that they are receiving approximately 27,600 in state funding, not a ton of money.

Meanwhile, if we make the same assumption for King County, they are receiving 1,178,000.  Still less per dollar, but far more than what Lincoln County received.

Basically, when you've got fewer people, even a small project is going to overtake your tax input to the state very quickly.  Considering a lot of Eastern counties cover a LOT of territory, there are almost always state roads being re-paved or projects of that kind.

So what I'm saying is, I do suppose I understand some negative sentiment towards the politics here, heck I live here on the dry side and I dislike the political leanings very much.  But using this map to make it seem like were a living in well-fare is quite misleading.

1370306640.0,27,self.Cascadia,1fmbkd,"My criticism of the phrase ""Free Cascadia""",39,12,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/1fmbkd/my_criticism_of_the_phrase_free_cascadia/,"I see a lot of social media posts where the phrase ""Free Cascadia"" is used and it sort of irks me.  I love the images and commentary it's used in, but I don't find it an optimal phrase to spread the message we're trying to spread to wider audience currently unaware of Cascadia.

There are two big qualms I have with this phrase:

1. It's a call to action which assumes that we currently are not free.  I completely understand the criticisms of our political status quo and sympathize with many of them.  But this phrase makes the underlying assumption that we living in Cascadia, as Americans and Canadians, live without freedom.  And that assumption just doesn't hold true to many who stop and think about it.  Yes, there's definitely many things off about our status quo, but we're not living under tyrannical regimes - I think this phrase has that underlying connotation.  I think a ton of people unaware of what Cascadia is and what bioregionalism is about would be very sympathetic to our visions, but probably won't be on board with the extreme notion that we are currently not free.

2. To piggy back off of that, the underlying assumption which ""Free Cascadia"" provides - that we currently are not free - leads one to make a connection between ""not being free"" and ""America"" or ""Canada.""  Therefore, to be free, one must be ""against"" America or Canada.  This too is a false connotation which I think is inhibiting our potential to spread our message.

I feel like these two points are processed internally be those who come across the phrase ""Free Cascadia"" and are subsequently rejected, causing our messages and visions to not be taken seriously by many who would otherwise be very interested in being a part of the movement in some way.  Instead, I'd like to offer a different phrase which I think will peak curiosity and provide for a much wider audience to become a part of the movement: **Re-Unite Cascadia**

This call to action speaks to our desire for unity, speaks to the fact that this region was united for a very long time before the 49th parallel became a thing, speaks to the fact that we're currently divided (an empirical fact), and it avoids any underlying assumptions of being oppressed or needing to be anti-American/anti-Canadian in order to support ideas and visions for Cascadia.

Just my two cents.  I know many of the images and writings I refer to which have ""Free Cascadia"" are done in a more humorous manner meant to peak someone's interest, but I believe the two points I outlined still have a negative effect on our efforts.",,False,self,t5_2s4dh,False,,flair,True,t3_1fmbkd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/1fmbkd/my_criticism_of_the_phrase_free_cascadia/,

This contest ends on Nov. 7th. 

Design a sticker that is less than 1 ft by 1ft in area. Preferably a sticker that can be stuck on bikes and cars, signs, and doors. All over, really. 

The winner will be selected by being the top sticker on this thread. If people are complaining of a tie, then I will print both. 1000 stickers will be printed if there is 1 winner, 500 of each if there are two. 

Stickers will be distributed to chapter heads and through the screenings of the Occupied Cascadia documentary. 

Recommendations: include reddit.com/r/cascadia somewhere on the sticker to draw more folks to this great discussion space. 
submit your image as a vector graphic or as a very high resolution piece (300dpi)

These will be vinyl stickers.

This competition is sponsored by Viva Cascadia Flags.

**The idea is:**

1) Throw up your city (hopefully somewhere around the Pacific Northwest) or see if someone has already added it

2) Upvote and throw a 'I'm in' or 'me too' comment if you're interested. Think about doing this even if you might not want to lead the effort but are willing to help out. Maybe add a suggestion for a good place to meet.

3) Give it a few days or people to add their names to the list, then a doodle.com calendar will be created for each place so people can add the times that work for them. After that, we can throw up the meeting time/place on the sidebar. All done!

**Ways in which our group can help out:**

1) Help broadcast the first meetings on our email newsletter and in our facebook groups.

2) Help new folks think of good ways to get started, what their interests are and some initial projects they could work on.

3) Help get a quick website up

4) And of course hook peoples up with stickers, flyers, patches and other merchandise and literature.

All it takes is a couple people in each city to get this started as a real regional movement.

What would our new nation look like? I wonder what might come out of a constitutional convention. A giant 'what if', but I find it interesting, especially since ideas of government and law have – obviously – radically changed since the 18th Century.

Seal and symbolism – we have a flag, but what about a seal or emblem? Simply the douglas fir? Other things we associate with national sovereignty: IDs, passports, birth certificates, license plates ...

Government – what would it look like? Would it be like a Westminster system, or an American-style republic?

Constitution – how would we decide our new constitution? Should we follow Iceland's example?

Foreign policy – what's Cascadia's relations with other major secessionist and bioregionalism movements?

Currency – modern and tech-infused, I assume. Coins, banknotes? Neither?

Capital – Seattle, Portland, Vancouver, something else?
 
Subdivisions – would we retain the current borders of US counties/BC districts?

Business – would utilities be nationalized? Cascadia would be home to some major international corporations ...

Environmentalism – open ended here ...

Anyway, I think it's fun to think about how all of this would look given our unique culture. I'm from the Seattle area, so my bias is leaning liberally, but I think that given the region's positions in relative to the rest of the United States, I'd expect the new nation to be somewhat progressive.

I believe in both an independent (or at least more autonomous) California and Cascadia. I can buy the argument put forward that even Northern California is sufficiently different from Cascadia that it wouldn't quite fit, and would work better as an independent nation, either with or without Southern California. 

Now, that being said, I do see a lot of shared culture between California (at least NorCal) and Cascadia. We have a lot in common, and that's awesome. Thus, it is so shocking to me the sheer level of just automatic hatred lots of supporters of the Cascadia movement hold for anyone South of the Oregon border. Surely both our causes are better served by working together in friendship? Its very disheartening to see comments that basically declare all of California to be some sort of hell hole, and frankly lessens my enthusiasm for the Cascadian movement as a whole. 

Does anyone else here feel the same way, or should I and my fellow Northern Californians consider ourselves persona non grata on r/Cascadia?",,False,self,t5_2s4dh,False,,,True,t3_mbcuk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/mbcuk/whats_with_the_kneejerk_hatred_of_california_on/,

Will the government be restricted and citizens/environment protected by a constitution?  What would be the monetary/fiscal policies?  Would Cascadia retain a standing army, or reserve organised militia?  How do we remove anti-Cascadian, Can-American interests?  How will indigenous peoples be recognised?  I apologise for the number of points to address, but I believe unless we can arrive at a platform on which to win the support of the masses and differentiate our cause from the current paradigm, Cascadia will remain a hypothesis for novels, microbreweries and bumper stickers at best.

Education is arguably the most important factor in the sustained success of Cascadia. How would the curriculum differ from the United States? Should schools be entirely state-run, or does the private sector have a role? How is it funded? What benchmarks should we hold our educators and students to, and how will we enforce them? What should higher education reform look like?

The Cascadia Education Project is a 501c3 non-profit fiscal sponsor. Here's our mission: 


Cascadia Education Project offers educational, participatory, and collaborative opportunities to the public of the Cascadia bioregion for the purposes of fostering an awareness which holds local culture and ecology as foundations for the sustainable and holistic reinhabitation of the bioregion. CEP adheres to the “Cascadian principles of unity”, also known as “the common bond” of a unified Cascadian culture, and in doing so commits to supporting and disseminating the principles held therein.


Cascadia Education Project engages sponsored projects and partners in a process of visioning collective educational, community building and healing, and ecologically restorative efforts within a context of bioregional reinhabitation. This is accomplished via approaches including but not limited to: providing umbrella support to compatible start-up projects, partnering with compatible organizations and aligned community entities, identifying and supporting project to project and project to partner collaborations, gleaning educational output for bioregional curricula, and networking projects and partners with communities and watershed organizations.


Cascadia Education Project integrates novel meeting and organizational processes which include: consensus and facilitated decision making, non-hierarchical membership structures, dynamic and rotating leadership opportunities, ecological and cultural representations and presence within meeting formats, utilizing engaging meeting locations, participatory agenda construction and follow-up processes, and language-of-place exercises.


In order to properly fiscally sponsor projects that come to us, we are in need of some support from a lawyer who understands non-profits. 

If you are one, or know of anyone, please send them our way. Email tim@cascadiaeducationproject.org

Sure, there are sites that list which brewpubs are where, but they all lack the information we all want to know: ""Where can I get the best pint?"" and ""What beer should I get?""

Now, sure, the answer to the second question is probably ""all of the above"", but not all beers are created equal, and not all breweries make a good Lager, IPA, Porter, or Hefeweizen. This is where you guys and gals come in. I want to try to create a definitive list of where to find the best beers, regardless of where you are in Cascadia.

In terms of features, it is relatively close to ""General American"": our distinctive features are rather small. They do exist, however, and here is a list:

* The Cot-caught merger (shared with Canada, the Midwest, Pittsburgh, and Boston)

* /u/ becomes [ʉ] or [ɯ]

* The vague-bag merger (though this is only partially true, /ɛ/ -&gt; [eɪ] before g)

* Canadian raising (/aɪ/ and /aʊ/ are raised before voiceless obstruents)

* /æ/ is lowered in the direction of [a].

* Before the velar nasal [ŋ], /æ/ becomes [e]

* /ɑ/ is backed and sometimes rounded to become [ɒ]. 

Edit: also:

* /t/ and /d/ -&gt; [ ɾ ] between vowels and liquids (eg Seattle -&gt; See-aa-dull)

* /tn/ and /dn/ -&gt; [ n̰ ] (eg burden -&gt; burr-'n, also with ""m"")

A chart of our vowels can be seen [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Pacific_Northwest_English_vowel_space.PNG). For comparison, [this](http://www.ic.arizona.edu/~lsp/IPA/VowelChartLF.gif) is ""General American"" and [this](http://dialectblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/rp.gif) is Received Pronunciation ""BBC English"". Other dialectical features include the use of words derived from Chinook Jargon, such as skookum, potlach, chuck, saltchuck, itkus, tyee, tolo, as well as place names: Alki, Chinook, Colchuck, Hyas, Ikt, Illahee, Ipsoot, Pilchuck, and [more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinook_Jargon_placenames).

I would love to learn more from my fellow redditors about your thoughts on Cascadia. Mainly how you would feel about forming your own country based on economic and environmental similarities. Not to even mention the cultural similarities that we all know we share. I know this can stem a lot of questions and I'm open to that. I want to debate and learn with you all on this fascinating topic. I have been searching the web for quite a while tonight and quite a few places told me to visit reddit for answers. Since I was a part of the reddit community anyway, I figured I could meander into the Cascadian community as well. Cheers.

I try to explain that I agree that divergent thought is extremely important, and that I am not looking for an environment where everyone thinks the same way; rather, I envision a collection of people that are looking for the same things and have the same goals, just with different ideas about how to get there.

I am currently reading Paul Thompson's *The Agrarian Vision* and this part struck me as being remarkably appropriate for explaining this kind of idea. I thought you all may be interested to read it.

""This type of thought places individuals within concentric webs: family, community, and nature. As described in Aristotle’s (384–322 bce) Politics, these webs work as interacting hierarchies to establish feedback loops ensuring that individuals internalize the consequences of their ac- tions into habits of personal character. One does not stand back from a potential impact and wonder how to value it; rather, one sees the whole organic situation as creating more specific value commitments, which are understood as virtues that integrate and preserve the whole. Families provide an environment for the growth and development of children, but communities, in turn, provide an environment that can either help or hinder the proper functioning of family life. Communities themselves take on unique characteristics by virtue of the regional environment in which they exist. In an integrated and healthy moral environment, ten- sions among family loyalty, citizenship, and stewardship are actually a creative and positive force. They counterbalance one another and prevent the exclusive or obsessive development of any one character tendency over others. A balance or harmony of the virtues signals right action. Decline occurs when otherwise virtuous conduct tends toward excess, veering in the direction of vice.""

TL;DR The Greeks had some interesting ideas about the role of divergent opinions. Honestly, this can't really be TL;DRed. It isn't that long, read it if you're interested I guess.",,False,self,t5_2s4dh,False,,,True,t3_17dyxn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/17dyxn/an_interesting_idea_for_envisioning_cascadia/,

The original intent of this little slice of Reddit was to discuss the things that matter to those of us who are lucky enough to consider the Pacific Northwest home. Things like local news stories, new/interesting art, culture, technological endeavors, sporting events, non-partisan political discussions, jokes, etc. are all welcome here. What is not welcome here is hatred, bigotry, intolerance, shilling, spamming, and overall douchebaggery. 

The mods work very hard to address the issues that are raised, and deal with those who are just here to start trouble. We're not trying to play sheriff, be the bad guy, censor free speech, or push any particular agendas. We just ask that you act civilized when dealing with your fellow Cascadian Redditors. Simply saying ""Fuck you for removing my post"" isn't going to get you very much traction with anyone.

That being said, there are some posts and users which we have removed from the subreddit. These posts were either completely irrelevant, incorrectly submitted, had links that were invalid, or were attempting to incite violence toward particular groups of people based on sex, creed, color, ethnicity, etc. The users who have been removed have been removed due to either child-like, trolling behavior, or for posting the offending materials listed above. These bans, much like any other ban on the internet, are temporary, and completely circumventable. Essentially, they're designed to be a time-out in order to let cooler heads prevail.

Ultimately, we don't want to have to ban anyone, nor do we want to have to remove content from this subreddit. That's why the upvote/downvote system exists...to weed out the bad posts, while promoting the good posts. If something egregious slips through the cracks, please either downvote it, report it, or both. 

We're trying to create a welcoming place for our 3,000 plus subscribers. In order to do that, we simply ask that you, as a subscriber, keep being awesome, and help us discourage those who are only out to troll.

Again, thanks for being awesome. I know that this doesn't affect the vast majority of you, but I felt it was my duty to keep you all in the loop.

**TL;DR: We removed a few posts that were not keeping with the spirit of this subreddit and banned a couple users. We don't like doing it, but bans are temporary, and sometimes necessary to keep the flow of information going. Posting guidelines are in the second paragraph. If you're unsure about a post you see, ask a mod.

However, rather than just pull my hair and screech about being associated with the Tea Party movement, I'd like to propose something more positive: forming a Cascadia political party, similar to the PQ in Quebec or the SNP in Scotland.

Now would be an excellent time to direct political action where it could best be served: a party dedicated to Cascadia, so that we can escape the two-party system and being mired in politics that don't serve our region by nominating candidates for local offices they could stand a reasonable chance of winning, to begin enacting positive change on that local level.

From there we can set the building blocks for greater independence and eventually the means to totally self-govern if the right opportunity comes.

Having never formed a political party before I have no clue what the process is - but deciding on a name and working together on a platform seems like a great place to start, either online or setting a date for a ""convention"" where we could get together and talk about it in person.

What personal freedoms of property and person do you want protected most of all? How would you change the current constitution of your country? You submit ideas as to what you want to see in a Cascadian Bill of Rights and I'll make any changes you want to have put in! I've omitted the last two since they reference the constitution.

Some good starting places are:

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights#Preamble

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Constitution

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms

* Your own wacky ideas

Try to keep as many of your ideas centered on personal and property-based freedoms, such as searches, seizure of property, arms, cruel and unusual punishments, self-indictment, and freedom of speech.

Let's start with the US Bill of Rights as the template. What would you clarify or change? Post and I'll edit it!

---

* First Right – Establishment Clause, Free Exercise Clause; freedom of speech, of the press, and of assembly; right to petition

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

* Second Right - Right to Equality for all people

All people shall be equally protected under the law, regardless of, but not limited to, age, race, creed, color, sex, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, marital status, health status, body shape or modification, and socioeconomic status.

* Third Right – Protection from unreasonable search and seizure.

The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

* Fourth Right – due process, double jeopardy, self-incrimination, eminent domain.

No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

* Fifth Right – Trial by jury and rights of the accused; 

Confrontation Clause, speedy trial, public trial, right to counsel
In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.

* Sixth Right – Civil trial by jury.

In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of Cascadia, than according to the rules of the common law.

* Seventh Right – Prohibition of excessive bail and cruel and unusual punishment.

Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.

* Eighth Right - Right to popular secession

If a region/province of Cascadia should hold a referendum which clearly and openly demonstrates &gt;67% of the population is in support of independence, they should be allowed the right to peaceful secession. Cascadia would have no grounds to invade/suppress the ""revolution"" and the government and people of Cascadia would acknowledge independence after completing negotiations regarding military facilities, trade deals, roadways, and shared land deals over resource management.

* Ninth Right – Protection from quartering of troops.

No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.

* Tenth Right - Right to join Cascadia

If a region/province outside or formerly of Cascadia should hold a referendum which clearly and openly demonstrates &gt;67% of the population is in support of joining Cascadia, they should be allowed the right to join. If the citizens of Cascadia hold a referendum which clearly and openly demonstrates &gt;67% of the population supports the new area joining, they will thereafter be recognized as being part of Cascadia, after completing negotiations regarding military facilities, trade deals, roadways, and shared land deals over resource management.

http://www.oregonlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2011/03/gray_wolf_debate_lands_in_the.html

How I understand it, is that wolves help the environment by hunting elk. This culls the population of the elk, and increases the aeration of the soil (their hooves rip up the dirt). This in turn allows for grasses and trees to take root, bringing biodiversity to the region and preventing erosion. With less erosion, the streams run cleaner, and the salmon thrive.  What is good for wolves is good for salmon.  And obviously, what is good for salmon is good for Cascadia.

Events will feature music, food, events (maybe a game of 'Capture the Doug'?), T-shirt, bandana, patch and flag making, and more importantly the chance to meet all the other folks out there interested in the idea of Cascadia. 

We'll also have several collaborative art projects that everyone will be encouraged to help us create as we travel. 

Come meet your fellow Cascadians, no passports necessary.

July 1st is Canada Day, July 4th US Independence Day, and so we have chosen this weekend, and the symbolically important Peace Arch to celebrate the things that make the Pacific Northwest unique. 

An inter-dependence that transcends national and state boundaries and unites us together. 

* Portland: June 29th
* Seattle: June 30th
* Peace Arch: July 1st 

Details will be added as soon as we get them confirmed. If you can't make the events in Portland or Seattle, hold a gathering in your city or region and join us at the Peace Arch. Show your support, and we'll get you added to our list of events.

We'll also be working to try and provide everyone with ride-shares and crash space if they need it, so just leave a comment or message us directly and we'll try to get to you. Also contact us if you have extra space.

Thanks!

Our drive was up a few hills into what seemed like the middle of no where. As we drove, the trees and mountains got bigger and bigger and houses got farther and farther spread out from each other. Once we finally got to the brewery, on these couple acres of land, surrounded by trees in a car garage, we stepped out of the vehicle and heard nothing but silence.

You could smell the fresh air along with the wood burning from burn piles or fireplaces in the area. A bird would chirp now and again. The mountains were HUGE (Olympic Mountain range) and covered in snow. The trees were greener than I've ever seen. We just both stood there for a minute looking around as the crisp cool air brushed against our faces. Roughly 40 degrees that afternoon. We looked at each other then proceeded inside where we sampled a few of the fine brews the new Brewery had to offer. More people showed up and we discussed the Seahawks game and the up coming Sounder season and soccer in general all while drinking this delicious craft beer.

Memetic Cascadia: A knowledge sharing course on building a contagious Cascadia

Course description:

We will examine ways to transform the abstract idea of Cascadia, the bioregion, into a contagious idea  associated with our regional identity. The class will consist of knowledge-sharing as well as creating a functional workspace from which to spread the meme of being “Cascadian.” The intent of the class is to eventually become a “think tank.” 

This course is FREE as it is part of Portland Free School.  The goal is to create a bioregional awakening (Cascadia) that becomes widespread and very contagious and then create a ""culture of active social change.""


Time:
Mondays (starting July 11th) 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM


Location:

Okay we have not found a permanent location for the class and I have decided no matter what we will start on July 11th at 5:00 PM.  So that first class will meet at the front door of Millar Library at PSU.  There is a big beautiful tree that PSU had to build around when they redesigned the library years ago.  We will meet there and send ""runners"" to find a study room either in library of Smith Memorial Hall (northwest across from the library).  When we find an empty room that we can use then we will leave a note at the entrance of the library (we will put a Doug flag or something indicating Cascadia on it with directions).  To get to PSU campus if by bus then there is the Max lines that go up Fifth Avenue end at PSU and the Portland street car also crosses the campus.  The following is the address to the Millar Library:

Portland State University Library
1875 SW Park Avenue
Portland, OR 97201

http://library.pdx.edu/

Future location of classes are still to be located.  We need a place that will not be interrupted by restaurant music, loud pub talk and other normal interruptions.  The ideal location should have a whiteboard, internet access, chairs and a center table.  Also a projector and screen or infocus machine would be really great.  We are looking into the Red &amp; Black Cafe, PSU student clubs, several downtown churches and so forth.  I would prefer downtown only because it is centrally located for those coming from all directions in Portland and its outskirts, but if a location that has a main bus route of Max line  near by then that would due.

The citizens have created, for all intents and purposes, a society that is free of the materialist, paternalistic culture that they have left behind. However, the shortcomings of the novel far outweigh the great concept of the premise.

Now it's been at least two years since I've read the book, but I'll try to do my best to point out what bothered me about the novel.

- Undeveloped protagonists - I don't need to really explain anything here that Amazon reviewers haven't pointed out already, except that it definitely made the story less believable. This might be the most forgivable aspect.

- Unrealistic expectations of the new society - A society free of cars might actually be attainable, but there are some bizarre cultural transformations that take place within the blink of an eye, only twenty years of independence. It was definitely obvious the era Callenbach was writing this book for this reason. Free sex was everywhere and there was the very dated concept of separating races into their own communities.

- Extremely focused on the Bay Area - Almost the entire novel focuses on a protagonist who for the most part stays within the Bay Area, which is not necessarily a bad thing. However, there are barely a handful of references to anything north of the bay. I thought it was hypocritical of Callenbach to write about a people who revolted against a U.S. who were ignorant of their interests, but preceded to ignore 90% of Ecotopia. Callenbach himself was an academic at Berkeley which has a somewhat deserved reputation for its academic department being very insular.

For all of these reasons, I don't think that the ideas presented within Ecotopia represent our movement very well. I am as environmentally inclined as any of you, but I hate to see us represented by this piece of writing. If I could recommend a book that we can all rally around, a piece of literature that truly represents the spirit of Cascadia and Cascadians, I would much prefer Ken Kessey's *Sometimes a Great Notion* over Callenbach's *Ecotopia.* Kessey was a home-grown writer who truly encapsulated the northwest - it's truly an epic novel in many ways.

There is no need to incur the expense of building and maintaining a Capitol building when secure online communications can achieve the same purpose.

I propose that the Republic of Cascadia legislature use video teleconferencing to coordinate and to carry out their duties. A secure, government-run communications link* can enable our legislators to exchange ideas and cast votes. Here is an example scenario:

Legislator Jones enters her home office and logs into the Legislature website (https://legislators.legislature.rc) and sees that an appropriations bill is being debated. She reads the text of the bill and sees that Legislator Smith has given a 3-minute speech in favor of the bill and that Legislator Castillo has given a 3-minute speech opposing the bill. Legislator Jones clicks on each of these prerecorded videos in turn and listens to the arguments given. She makes up her mind on the bill and turns on her camera connected to her computer. She then uploads her own 3-minute video giving her opinion on whether or not to pass the bill. When the time comes, they will all submit their votes electronically. She then contacts Legislator Chen and video chats with him about a different bill that she wants to collaborate on drafting with him. Later, she leaves her home to meet with the people of her district and discuss issues with them.

Of course, these debates would be available for any citizen to view for themselves and the votes would be made public. The only thing that the public couldn't do was to vote for the bills, unless they had been referred to the public (or enough signatures gathered) for referendum.

The advantages of not having a Capitol building would be: No expense of building and maintaining such a building, keeping legislators in their home districts and in touch with their constituents, and demonstrating to the citizens of Cascadia and to the world that the Republic is committed to maintaining a technological cutting edge.

Who should we talk to?,35,19,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/jvozs/hi_rcascadia_my_friend_and_i_are_thinking_about/,"If you can help us find a space, or Know People who might be interested in selling goods and services, please let us know!

Some background:

I'm a 22 y.o. EE who took a Bitcoin Roadtrip from Hartford to Los Angeles, spending only Bitcoins for two months. I spent the most on gas and food, usually with [proxy buys](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9jC0TP-Yug).

I'm an [agorist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agorism), so I think having a local non-FRN currency will lead to more efficient businesses, cheaper products, and reduced need for government.

So we'll be starting from the ground up, building the community of Cascadians who are interested in participating. We'll set up an open source framework to make it easy to trade goods and services, and use a web of trust to let you filter content according to the people you trust.

I ended up in Portland in late June after finishing up the roadtrip and I really like it here. I'm keeping an eye out for EE jobs but in the meantime, I'm unemployed. This puts me in a catch 22 because it's damn difficult to get a roof over my head without income and it's damn difficult to do anything productive without a workspace. My buddy took a bus from the Northeast and he's right here with me. We've been couchsurfing for a few weeks but our welcome is wearing thin and my car's [in the shop](http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/jvhmv/help_me_fix_my_99_firebird_need_someone_with_efi/).

So, finding some housing is our number one priority.  We're looking for a headquarters where we live and work. We'll consider anything with plumbing, wiring, and cell/internet coverage. A cheap penthouse in Metro Portland would be the best location, or barring that, at least somewhere with MAX access.  We'd like to find some housemates to participate in the project, so the ideal space could fit maybe 4-8 people.

I'm willing to spend dollars for utilities and rent if necessary; the housemates can pool their bitcoins and sell them at the end of the month for these bills.  Of course, this does kinda feel like cheating, so we would be happier if a landlord was willing to accept BTC. They can always sell the btc for dollars immediately.

Finding food and clothing will be a second priority. Got a food truck or a shop somewhere? It'll be really easy for you to participate - I've seen some nice web apps, android apps, and exchanges that are all improving the bitcoin user experience. 

We might get some IP cameras and sell access to live streams, make it a reality show type deal. We won't start living on Bitcoins alone until a) we've planned this out thoroughly enough or b) I hit my credit card limit, whichever comes first.

I am a new face to the Cascadia movement, though I remember hearing of it a few times in passing over the years. I would first like to apologize in advance, as I've been awake for over thirty-six hours, just reading everything I can on this subreddit and cascadianow.org, so my thoughts may be jumbled.

Over the past couple of days I have combed through many of the topics around the web and have found that I agree with most of what people are saying. I don't believe that the Cascadia we all hope for will be viable in my lifetime (though I assure you that I hope I'm wrong) but I see no issue with paving the way to change, for future generations. 

I am currently situated a couple hours north of the Okanagan in British Columbia, and it seems that there isn't much of a voice for the movement up in my parts. Maybe due to the fact that it is a smaller city or that people just aren't aware. I want to help spread the word, in whatever way possible. I see some issues for myself though:

1. How do I present Cascadia to those who may not see the value in a positive light? My partner and families have extremely varying political, economical, cultural, and environmental views to mine. It seems to me that they would dismiss the movement as a simple 'hippy thing' and leave it at that. 
2. I live in a small city (approximately 80,000) and since the majority of the movement is prevalent in cities such as Vancouver, Seattle and Portland it doesn't feel as though mine would get a proper chance to come to terms with it before being squashed by something else. 
3. Since being a Canadian is already seen as somewhat of a minority (due to populations) within the Cascaidan bioregion, it makes the chances even lower for support on my end.

Since I've been up for quite some time, my brain is a bit more than fried. What are some solutions you could suggest? I don't want to sit idly by while the change takes form, I would love to be apart of it. As I said; I don't see this happening in my lifetime, but I don't see the harm in getting the word out.

Thanks to all who comment. I look forward to talking with you all.

1364312065.0,15,self.Cascadia,1b1nod,I think I'm starting to articulate what Cascadia means to me. What do you think?,19,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/1b1nod/i_think_im_starting_to_articulate_what_cascadia/,"---This is a reply I posted on the [Buzzword of the Month](http://www.bcbusiness.ca/marketing-media/buzzword-of-the-month-cascadia) article---

Cascadia is not a brand. It is a bioregion and the name represents the incredible beauty and abundance this land shares with us. If it is only treated as a brand, 99% of it's meaning is lost. 

The name should only be used to represent that which is working to protect, restore, bring equality, justice, and beauty to her. Through permaculture design principles like biomimicry, we can use our enormous brains to actually help bring more abundance. 

Additionally, much of Cascadia is unceded Native land and the rest is plagued with broken treaties. The Idle No More (Indigenous Nations Movement) is about restoring Native communities and cultures to their rightful place. As non-Indigenous people, we should be honoring them, allowing them the space they need to rekindle their culture of inhabitation, and hope that they will share with us a knowledge of how to live in right relationship with the land, instead of just on it or off it. This is the process of decolonization for everyone. We are all colonized at this moment and need to recognize it. 

We live in a time where the US and Canadian governments are wholly run by corporations. We're even taught to think like corporations. Cascadia is under constant threat of having her remaining ancient forests clear-cut, her natural gas extracted through fracking, and used for the transport of oil and coal that should never be burned (not only for the sake of Cascadians but for all people around the world). 

If there's any hope here, it's the hope that we can create a society that governs itself from the ground up. Where people self-organize in resilient communities that help bring more life and abundance to Cascadia. In order to do so, it means reclaiming our power from Washington D.C. and Ottawa and kicking the solely profit-driven corporations out who contradict these goals of life before profit. This is where the community rights movement fits in. 

It's already happening here. That's really why the name Cascadia has become so popular. People feel it in their heart and see it in the changes happening around them. They can't help but use it. 

This isn't Utopia. It's Cascadia and it's happening now. Through permaculture, decolonization, and community rights, we're creating the world we want to live in. Visit http://cascadia-pdx.org to learn more.

Whose to say that the current city structure will remain intact after a collapse or switch in power?

While that is fun and worthwhile, there are also certainly a lot that we could achieve to bring British Columbia, Oregon and Washington closer together and share more across the border.

So that's what this thread is about. What can we do right now to bring people together? What can we lobby our still separate governments for? I have a few ideas:

-More frequent train service to Vancouver? There is a customs roadblock with the federal government that is standing in the way of the region's needs.

-More cultural collaboration? Maybe a Cascadia music series with local artists touring across the region as a group?

-More collaboration in activism and advocacy. Are we talking to each other enough? This movement can bring together different groups doing the same thing on different sides of the border.

-More cross-border soccer tournaments for teams of all levels?

These are a few ideas, but I want to hear more. I know they're out there. And wherever possible, let's try to start action on these and other topics right away.

[Action],15,1,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/uz6ss/to_build_an_energy_policy_for_cascadia_action/,"Cascadia needs an energy policy which eliminates petrol within a defined period of time. Few would debate this; the science is not disputable. Fossil fuels are inefficient, expensive to claim and process, and environmentally filthy. Currently there are bountiful technologies for producing clean, inexpensive energy which could out-compete petrol if not for subsidies and unfair legislation. However, not all of them are right for Cascadia.

Friends of Doug, we need an energy policy that makes sense for Cascadia. We need an energy policy that we can **show** to the general public which contrasts with the current policies of Canada and the United States. It must be *leaner*, *cleaner*, and *a whole lot cheaper*. 

It must be specific to the bio-region, rooted in current scientific data, and provide a clear path toward the elimination of petrol. It needs to define our resources and the best methods to tap them. It should also be sensitive to economic considerations, and prescribe solutions for the challenges which will arise during the transition.

This should not be done within this community. Stay with me.

Cascadians should commission respected experts in the field to craft a comprehensive energy policy. This is arguably the single most important issue of our lifetime- we should put all of our *energy* into building a policy which will be read and reviewed across the globe. 

With a concrete, clear vision in hand we can truly offer a competitive alternative to CANUS which will be taken *seriously* by the Cascadian populace. Most importantly **we can begin to apply serious pressure to the existing architecture by offering a tangible solution**.

Now for the brick wall. Real action requires real effort, and real money. That doesn't mean we can't be deft about it. These are the hard steps:

* We must seek out professionals with expertise in energy and energy economics who have an interest in this study.
* We must work closely with them to determine their needs and the cost of this study.
* We must raise enough capital to commission this study.
* In the event that we are successful, we must provide a forum for our experts to communicate and exchange data.
* We should strongly consider hiring a PR individual or firm to provide the study's narrative to the public.

Kickstarter is the obvious option for fundraising, although canvassing and mailing may be advisable (which may require working with sympathetic organisations).

For example, I know many liberal progressives that enjoy hunting and fishing, and many self-titled Conservatives that care deeply about environmental conservation and think same-sex marriage is fine.

That said, when I've had to live in states like California, I sense a huge divide that is reflected in the mainstream news media. People segregate themselves socially and geographically by their political beliefs, which leads to a *""Im better, smarter, wealthier, more righteous, and more whatever than you are""* and people cramming into a political box.

In my opinion, mutual respect and understanding of our individual differences and lifestyles is key to our mission, and breaking free of the FoxNews/MSNBC ""Left"" and ""Right"" is a big hurdle for achieving greater regional unity. That's just one thing and one guy's opinion though...

What do you think are some challenges we face for achieving greater regional and cultural unity? Outside business or political influence? The US-Canadian Border?

Right now we have a great group which meets informally every 2 weeks, and have coordinators who will be starting student groups at NCCC, SCCC, SU and UW (students will likely be holding their own planning meetings, but also are also a welcome part of general meetings). We'd also love to hear from anyone interested in the Puget Sound area (looking at you Bellingham, Everett, Tacoma and Oly) who might be interested in either joining us for a meeting, or getting a group started in their own area. 

Projects are based around whatever people feel is important or a good idea, and could range from simply getting thrown on our email list, to artwork, postering, newsletter, website stuff, designing literature, procuring merchandise, selling said merchandise, and in general helping raise awareness of the idea of Cascadia. 

If you're interested in the idea, then we're excited to hear from you.

Meet at the clocktower at Riverfront Park initially and we'll find out if we want to move from there (I promise I won't be late this time!)

Its time to get the ball rolling Cascadians! This meeting we'll see about hashing out some admin related things and talk about reaching out to the people and the various organizations we have in Spokane and the Inland NW. Also we should talk about some quick down and dirty actions we can execute on the short term while we are getting the word out to the people.

Feel free to bring your own agenda items you would like to discuss as well. I mostly laid those out in the description since I feel they are important things we need to take care of before we begin to get into the ""meat and potatoes"" of this. Admin stuff mostly means:

-Adopting a mission statement
-Adopting a name for the chapter (""Spocadia"" has already been suggested!)
-Figuring out who wants do what activism-wise as well as chapter responsibilities-wise

Boring stuff I know but I think its important we have at least the basics figured out before we start to engage the people of Spokane! Also I'm thinking about maybe moving the time to 3pm in case we need more time for things.

I am currently preparing for a college course I am teaching about films and filmmaking in Cascadia. It may be framed as 'The Pacific Northwest,' but I want to bring in the question of bioregionalism and Cascadia. 

I'm wondering if anyone knows of any core texts on 'Cascadia' that I might assign as a main reading? Most of the readings will be .pdfs and film texts, but I'm wondering if there is one I could slip in about the PACNW as well...

Anyway, any other suggestions of films would be welcome as well! This could be any film/media set in or about the Pacific Northwest/Cascadia.

that said, i was wondering if anyone's ever put thought into cascadia having it's own ranger group. people who would make sure that the natural beauty of cascadia stays that way, ensures wildlife is still healthy through it, in general making sure that the nature that makes cascadia so green and beautiful is itself thriving and living. 

one idea i had was to give some hunters and fishermen who venture into these wilds a sort of membership to the rangers. they go about their hunting, and return back any findings of unusual or negative activity. both parties could potentially benefit from this i think.

The current situation regarding the Native Americans or whatever nomenclature you prefer, is less than ideal in my view. Being on the US side of the border I am pretty unfamiliar with how Canada deals with this issue, but honestly the reputation that comes along with the reservations seems shameful. 

People think of many of the reservations as slums with little infrastructure or job opportunity's, and the ever present problems of the casinos and the alcohol. Cascadia will have to confront this problem at some point so lets at least get some ideas. 

I say the best thing we could do is involve the tribal leadership with the terms of their inclusion in Cascadia this would at least be an improvement on many of the policies of the US. 
Do we allow the Tribes the option of secession? I think morally we should though I don't think it would be good for the Tribes or Cascadia. Do we support them though special funding or does that just go to support the idea that the tribes are lesser people incapable of helping themselves? I doubt we can avoid involvement to be quite honest. 

I know the reservations are at least in some way supposed to preserve and protect the culture and way of life of the tribes that historically lived throughout the Bioregion. I am not sure though, that this is a viable possibility anymore at least not the way we are currently doing things.

 The Reservations stagnate without the public funding and private investment that lifts a community up. The casinos help the community members lucky enough to be involved with them, but seem to other wise to bring down the community by luring in the kind of people that aren't great for growing communities. The checks that come in for tribal members are an interesting thought, but I am not sure that money alone is enough. 

I propose abandoning the current arrangement of reservations and opening them up. Some might say this would be the end of the Tribes, but if we can be perfectly honest with ourselves the tribes in a traditional sense ended a long time ago. The best we can do is provide an effective means for the people living on the reservations to plug in with the rest of Cascadia (assuming the like this plan and choose to go along with it). We use public money to invest in infrastructure on the reservation creating schools, roads, medical facilities, law enforcement buildings, and parks. We buy the land from the tribe for a hefty sum of money (which is evenly distributed among the members living on the resvations), and then set up a community center or something dedicated to the local tribes history and culture, but also establishing some sort of new organization run by the tribe out of this building to keep the maintain the history and culture of the community. 

We then sell this new ripe real estate off for dirt cheap (re:we lose a lot of money), to community planners with some sort of agreement of lowered house land pricing for the tribe-members then watch as the investment rolls in and housing and businesses try to get into this cheap land with such good amenities from all that public investing. This plan allows us to help the tribe without condescending to them or leaving them to fend for themselves. Plus each tribe member can use their portion of the money from the huge land buy to purchase a new home in this community or travel to another part of Cascadia and settle where they choose. Hopefully this can free up a few members stuck in the poverty cycle.

This plan relies on a great deal of money which I am not sure a brand new community could afford, and would also NEED to have the consent of the majority of the community otherwise the tribes may begin to feel that they are once again not involved with their own fate.

This was rather long and entirely hypothetical. Just wanted to get a discussion started. I will understand if this is too much for the community to handle considering at once or if it gets skipped over. This idea has just been sitting at the back of my head for so long I needed to share it. Thanks r/cascadia for being the outlet for my ambition!

This Hasn't Been Discussed Yet!,15,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/ucbmj/immigration_policy_this_hasnt_been_discussed_yet/,"Oregon has a relatively substantial amount of immigration, particularly from Central America, however I am not sure about the other areas of Cascadia. The United States, in my opinion, has an unacceptable policy on immigration that is often borderline inhumane.

What would be a reasonable policy?

I don't think it should be as strict as US's policy. Immigrants *create* jobs. Immigrants provide an abundant amount of labor that we *rely* on. I say, if they are already here, they are welcome unless they break a law that causes harm to someone. They aren't here to usurp the resources of the rich, or to ""steal"". They are here to build on the American (Cascadian?) Dream. In addition, new immigrants would be scarce in number anyway. The US would provide a very big buffer zone. Any immigrants who make it to Cascadia would be lucky, and should be welcomed. Is this radical? Yes. But so is seceding from the States!

We should be a safe haven for those who are *forced*, yes forced--because for most it's a choice between life by emigration, or death--to immigrate. Worried about population increase? Some more numbers, especially in the northern parts of Cascadia, wouldn't hurt! ""But they're illegal!"" Well, it was illegal for Rosa Parks to sit in the front of the bus, but that doesn't make the law right or wrong. I guess I am just advocating for a less strict, more humane policy on immigration. I wouldn't know the logistics--this is mostly a theoretical rant/statement--I just wanted to bring up the topic.

What do you think?

Since then I've been doing some reading about various different Bills of Rights around the world and think it's time to make one for Cascadia.  I personally believe that Canada's Charter is pretty good, but South Africa's Bill of Rights is what we should strive to emulate/improve upon.  South Africa's Bill of Rights is actually inspired by Canada's Charter and I think Cascadia could improve upon it even further.
