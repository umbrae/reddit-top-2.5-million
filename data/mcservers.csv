And honestly, I haven't enjoyed any of them. Most of these servers go to huge ends to prevent griefers from getting into your ranks and destroying people's stuff. That's fantastic, but I havn't had a single problem with griefers. All my problems are with your moderators (and occasionally admins.) When I join a survival server, my list of tasks looks something like this:

1. Run away from civilization until I am in no-mans land.
2. Make a secret base that nobody will find and start hoarding food and supplies.
3. Make structures that are nice enough to get a passing glace from others.
4. If there is PVP, get full diamond gear and kick butt.

This is fun for me because it takes effort, and a lot of time. The problem is usually around step 2. Some moderator will teleport into my house, or fly around my house at mach 3 with full diamond armor. Then proceed to play god, watch me from above and either smite me or give me his eternal blessing by showering me with items he thinks I want. This kills the entire point of playing! I don't want your items, I don't even want to see YOU with those items. Having you find my base is enough of a punch-in-the-face to make me want to leave for good. Nothing kills my effort faster than someone instantly summoning an item or building that I spent DAYS on. I play to be unique and be able to show something interesting that I created with my brain and from my hard-spent time. NOT watch you get it in seconds.

So if you want to make your severs better, here are some tips:

1. Your focus on no-griefing is admirable, keep it up.
2. If you are a mod, DON'T wear diamonds. Hell, don't wear anything. If you are on a HUGE server and you have 10 mods and like being distinctive with a uniform- then wear chainmail.
3. I don't care if you have an economy system, or a trade system. But I had better not see anyone asking a mod for stuff because he died and his items fell in lava. If someone does ask, moderators should be professional enough to say ""no"". 
4. Your moderators should be like police officers. Nobody want's to see them unless they are called. If you're mods want to play like everyone else, I don't have a problem with that. But I have never seen a single mod that refused ALL cheats/powers and played like a normal individual.
5. Finally, I have seen many moderators 'stalk' people who they suspect of cheating/griefing. That is just creepy, even in a game. If you want to 'watch,' then use spectator tools. They let you watch from a camera perspective and nobody knows you're there. DO NOT just TP yourself over to me every 10 minutes.

The original idea about this server happened somewhere on /r/minecraft about 3-4 months ago. The subreddit  I linked quickly got a userbase of at least 5-600 subscribers the first few days, and here we are today. 1300+ subscribers, 2000+ players have visited our old map (470 so far on the new one, we made it YESTERDAY) and an average of about 50-70 people online at one time.

The server is pretty open, not entirely anarchy, but sort of. The ""roleplay"" is that nobody knows who they are, what happened in the past, you're all allowed to make your own stories. The subreddit is full of them!

Please read our subreddit in order to gain information on the player base, post your clans/factions, comment on posts about others clans/factions or whatever the hell runs through your mind (has to be inside the rules of course!).

-

Running from top-notch hardware, I bring to you MINER APOCALYPSE! The server started for the original and first subreddit /r/minerapocalypse, with one goal, a server which focuses on being deserted and lost in a world of chaos, looting but also the occasional friend.

Miner Apocalypse is not for the faint of heart. You will probably die, you will probably kill someone, but in the process you will have loads, upon loads of fun. The original subreddit gives you base information about what players are doing, who plays on the server, and news from the staff.  
On our website you will see a list of rules, a link for the people who want to donate, and a link to click if you've been banned.

We try our best to bring our players the greatest experience from a survival/pvp/semi-vanilla server by banning hackers, being supportive and letting the community grow by itself, and as little admin/mod impact as possible. Yes, moderators are able to play, but they do not have permission to ruin the game for you. If they do, you are enforced to tell us through using the /helpop command.

The server features creative use of random spawning, to ensure the best next-to-hardcore feeling. If you have a bed, however, random spawning will be overridden (just make sure to keep your bed safe!).

There are many player-made factions on Miner Apocalypse (no, we do not run a faction plugin) and people use the subreddit as the easiest way of communication. There are no rules on making a faction, you play the game like you want it to be played, with little- to no interaction from 3rd party plugins.

The server is best enjoyed hot, and griefing/stealing/killing is 100% allowed. Not said that it's smart to do, as people tend to keep a log over who are bad guys.

The server has over 2000 players visited all time, and around 50-100 players active EVERY DAY, maybe even more! We run a server located in Germany, but it should not be a real problem for international players, as long as your computer isn't running off a potato for internet.

IP: PLEASE CHECK OUR SUBREDDIT /r/minerapocalypse FOR INFORMATION ON HOW TO JOIN. IT'S IMPORTANT TO READ THE RULES BEFORE PLAYING, AS TO ENSURE YOU WON'T BE BANNED. OUR RULES ARE REALLY BASIC, AND SHOULD MAKE SENSE TO ALL OF YOU.

**TL;DR: Miner Apocalypse is a badass server you gotta join if you like having fun!

1313980565.0,71,self.mcservers,jq6hg,/r/mcservers its time we had a talk.,76,5,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/jq6hg/rmcservers_its_time_we_had_a_talk/,"This subreddit only has 2,352 readers so I don't feel like I should have to bring this up but it's time we got a few things straight.

There are a few types of minecraft servers but for the sake of simplicity we will go over two of them.

**The First:** A server that *you* own. You can physically come up and touch the box with your bare hands. You host it on hardware that you own presumably on your own (or more commonly) your mothers broadband service.

**The Second:** A service an online company provides for you. This can be a VPS, VDS, DHS, MHS, Cloud service hosting, or any other shared hosting provider. Just google [""minecraft hosting""](http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;source=hp&amp;q=minecraft+hosting&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=minecraft+hosting&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g5&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=1589l3834l0l3874l17l7l0l0l0l0l1008l2376l1.1.1.1.0.1.0.1l6l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.&amp;fp=e98f3ed7284443fe&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667) the results are rather overwhelming. 

At this point you may be asking yourself ""okay whats all that have to do with me?""

I am sick and tired of pouring through 50 servers that 13 year old kids host on their laptops with promises like ""24/7 server"" and ""large user-base"". Id be willing to bet only 1 out of every 5 servers on the ""whats hot"" page of this subreddit are actually **on line**. Especially since thats about the amount of IPs that I can actualy connect to when looking for a server.

Chances are if you have your own server that is hosted by you on your own connection its going to barely be stable. ISPs change customer IP addresses constantly and Himachi isn't the greatest alternative to this dilemma. Most younger server owners are bound to host MC servers on their wireless networks, I shouldn't even have to explain why this is a bad idea. and not to mention if your new with Bukkit your install is probably poorly configured and you have way too many plugins for your little home computer to host. Minecraft hosting isn't easy or cheap. It uses a massive amount of RAM, it takes a decent amount of processing power to run java and quick I/O access for loading and saving chunks is very resource heavy.

Bukkit installs and maintenance are not easy. Assuming you don't have a dedicated host that sets up Bukkit from you or has tools to set up bukkit for you, you will have to fully configure it yourself. Now I can expect some rage for posting this but hear me out. Installing Bukkit is easy as pie. You can even [download an EXE](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/craftbukkit-auto-installer-beginners.26555/#post-478221) that installs Bukkit for you, all you have to do is click a few buttons and BOOM you have a working install. But when it comes to giving users permissions to do various things this isn't easy and is only getting more difficult with future releases of Bukkit (for the time being, look up 1060s new permissions APIs). For every single plugin you have there are nodes you have to define in a groups file that allow your players to use one command and your mods to use another. finding these nodes and setting them up is time consuming especially if you want a good cheat proof server you need to have your ABCs covered. **bugs** when you have 20 plugins there are going to be bugs. Tons of errors, server crashes, massive lag, memory leaks. Hunting these down and finding the culprits can be difficult. Unless your a Bukkit pro and have tons of time to keep up with updates and config changes you should be advertising a 24/7 server. Players don't want to be on error ridden servers that go down every other hour.

Things I would like to see change: Educate yourself about your server and post accordingly. If you plan on having more than 5 users on at a time and you want to run a ton of plugins and have a 24/7 server look for a acceptable host. Do not hop on /r/mcservers and write a big long professional post encouraging a ton of users to join that you cant support. People spend a lot of time on servers working up stats in mcmmo, putting hours into building a house and mining for items. They also tend to bond with the community and make online friends. So when you advertise your server keep this in mind.


Things users looking for large servers can do instead of wasting time digging through crap to find a good server:
[http://minestatus.net/](http://minestatus.net/) This site is AWESOME it shows uptime which makes it obvious to tell who is reliable and who isn't. It also shows Players, Creation Date, Votes, and Score. Makes it easier to wade through the shit and find a legit server.

[http://minecraftservers.info/](http://minecraftservers.info/) I'll admit this a porly designed site. Its heavy in images and content and servers aren't sort-able by specific details. But it tends to have a more professional  userbase.

[http://bestofmc.com](http://bestofmc.com) it shows uptime, live maps and more!

&gt;The basic premise is that you spawn in a random location in the world, and there is no global chat. 

&gt;You are free to use local chat to seek out others and build a civilization, or live on your own.

&gt;Death results in a 6 hour ban, so there is some incentive to avoid dying.

Our user base is mostly mid-20's.

- 6 hour deathban

I love the people that MCServers has brought me, and I don't want that to stop. We are an established community with a couple of servers out there, and are always looking for new people. You may have seen us around - we are a no bullshit server that treats players with respect (unless you don't treat us with respect) and are quite welcoming. With 444 readers on our [subreddit](http://mcnsa.reddit.com) we are a server that has been around for over a year now.

**Noteworthy features**

We have full anti-grief protections in, and we are well staffed by non assholes (they may troll you a bit, but we encourage a sense of humor) and you will be playing with around 25-50 people at all time with similar mindsets (hopefully).

We have a currency system that was built from the ground up.  It has been wildly popular, keeps evolving, and you can read about it on our subreddit or visit the store itself at [po8.mcnsa.com](http://po8.mcnsa.com).

We have a chat system that has been built from the ground up.  It is less intrusive than HeroChat or the others and is pleasant to look at, as well as very feature rich. You have the ability to mute anyone that annoys you, speak only to those near you, as well as create your own channels for you and your friends.

Our ranking system is very robust.  With twelve separate ranks you will rank up depending on performance that is based around trust, kindness, and sometimes proper grammar.  Follow the rules and you'll be fine, and should rank up at a steady pace and gain abilities with each rank.  Due to the number of members we have it can be difficult to see who has been around enough for a rank up, therefore we encourage you to work with others, and engage in meaningful conversation in chat.

**mcnsa.com**

Server specs:

16 gigs of ram

i7 processor

Writes to a solid state drive

Backups every 3 hours

50 mbs connection

Mumble server (mcnsa.com)

We are an SMP server and encourage you to play the game like it was meant to be played. You might get a pair of gold pants or something random, but it's all in good fun. No griefing, read the rules and all will be well. PVP is enabled but only for *organized* duels. Random PVPing will not end well for you.

The server is mcnsa.com, and yes  that's all you have to type to join. No whitelist, no signing up, just come and play with us. We look forward to seeing you there.

* **Description**: 

Miner Apocalypse is a hardcore, semi-vanilla survival server that facilitates and encourages RP, but does not require it.  The server is set in a post-apocalyptic world where there are no laws and there is no authority (But there are server rules!). However this does not mean that civilisation is lost! Cities and factions rise from the ashes of the wasteland and attempt to live in peace or to achieve domination. Anything is possible on Miner Apocalypse as long as you have the will to pursue it. Feel free to go out and make friends. But be wary, some people on your path may not be as friendly as you hope.

The world of Miner Apocalypse is changing and the apocalypse survivors have rediscovered an old technology, the radio! It is the only way available for survivors to communicate over long distances. Re-join the apocalypse like you have never experienced it before with an all new hand-crafted custom map and custom plugins written especially for Miner Apocalypse!

Experience a massive 10K x 10K map created just for Miner Apocalypse with epic landscape features, such as volcanoes, waterfalls, craters, rivers, and mountains that extend above the clouds. Every block is put there to create an immersive and epic apocalypse experience.

*Some more information about Miner Apocalypse:*

• Tight knit, friendly community – Here at Miner Apocalypse we have an incredibly close community. Alliances crumble overnight and new enemies are made daily, as the server constantly produces new factions and new cities. You will come to learn how far a reputation can get you.

• Apocalyptic atmosphere – We have a local chat plugin that only allows players to communicate clearly within 100 blocks, beyond which the message becomes distorted and nameplates aren't visible at long distances. To communicate over long distances, survivors must use radio towers. .

• Griefing, raiding, and PvP are allowed – Anywhere on the map, that means there are no protected zones and of course, nowhere is safe. Arm yourself! There is little room for pushovers on Miner Apocalypse. Defend your possessions!

• Paid for by donations – Meaning that it is absolutely free, forever. Donating can earn you little perks such as unique in game flair and a reserved slot if you donate a certain amount. But we promise you don’t have to donate to have fun on the server.

• Run by the community, for the community – Have a good idea for the server? Post on the subreddit and gather support for your idea. The server is made for the community, so they make the decisions.

Why you should try flatcore:

1. Introduction tutorial at spawn, without tons of signs. Random spawn on a 10,000 by 10,000 superflat map, filled with villages, player bases and custom loot shrines!
2. Upon death, you go to Limbo – a death temple, where you can spend 1h trying to beat challenges, which could lead to your early revival.
3. Ranks are fully transparent and granted for skills. There is no hidden agenda, no subjective voting. Do weekly challenges, earn points, rank up.
4. MCNSA has been organizing Minecraft servers for over 2 years. We have a large community of avid Minecraft players. Staff is helpful and mature.
5. You should try flatcore if you never lusted after redstone or books. Believe us, the feeling is great – they’re not commodities on superflat.

THE SERVER

-24/7 Server

-Player limit: 20

-Player ranks based on trustworthiness (Peon, Default, VIP, Mod, Saint, God)

-Kits (Deluxe sets for VIPs)

-Monsters are turned OFF until health is serverside. No point in wasting CPU cycles on something that doesn't work. (you can still see them in dungeons though)

-There is a 32 unit protection radius on the spawn zone. Nobody but Super Mods/Admins can build here.

RULES:

-Obviously, no griefing. This will result in being permanently banned.

-Build your buildings at a decent distance from other buildings, no building-crowding. Failure to do this will result in having your building torn down by a mod or admin.

-TNT is for use by VIPs and above only. If you need something blown up ask someone.

-Asking for VIP or modship automatically disqualifies you for it.

-Backsass to mods is allowed, so long as it's justified.

-No water or lava structures.


Type /help if you need any, and seeing as this is a brand new server, please move away from the spawn to build!

**Server Name:** damNation.eu

**Server Website:** [damNation.eu](http://damNation.eu)

**Server Address:** *damNation.eu:25565*

**Game Play Types / Playstyle:** A bit of all-in-one: PvE/Adventure/Survival/Build-friendly/Creative/Projects/Survival Games etc.


**Why play on damNation?:** Age limit 15+! No Map Resets! Build Friendly settings! Protected Building! High Quality Special Projects! Adventures with custom adventure setup! Treasure Hunts! Full View Distance! ...and the Friendliest Staff and Community you will ever find!

Tourists may play ""Freedom"" (survival world with Grief Prevention), Survival Games, The Dropper. For all world access; registration and application on the forum is required as this assures higher quality and less griefing and player issues.


**Rules:** 

**Important rule #1**: This server is intended for mature adults with more than half a brain and we expect EVERYONE here to behave accordingly. You must be at least 15 years of age to be considered for membership.

**2.** Be courteous and respect others. Agree to disagree. No fighting, namecalling etc. This includes not heckling or demeaning lower ranks or the Tourists!

**3.** Real world legal and societal laws and rules apply! Just use your common sense, if somebody would not like if you did it in the real world - don't do it here.

**4.** No exploits, duping, cheating, stealing, griefing etc. You get ONE chance not to do that on this server! That means no cheat clients, especially no xray/ore finders. Cheaters, thieves and vandals do not belong here. We log all block and chest interactions and will BAN you! Do not peek into chests that belong to someone. Treasure chests (marked and notified on opening) are per player and you are expected to loot those when found (we have quite a few hidden).

**5.** Leave the landscape looking natural and beautiful please. Terraform to your hearts content, but: All trees must be cut down fully, leave no tall pillars, floating junk midair, screwed up water or ugly beaches/deserts anywhere please.

**6.** No giant pixelart, voxelart, letters, flags etc (statues and real ""builds"" are ok) in the regular worlds (creative play area is the only place you may build those).

**7.** Build with some taste please: Avoid large featureless walls/floors of cobble/dirt/birch/lava etc.

**8.** Aim to build within reasonable distance from each other. Minimum distance before it is customary to ask for permission is 128 blocks (=Normal Render Distance), you can also measure this with string.

**9.** Make sure large redstone creations or machinery is turned off when not in use. We have a very powerful server, but it is still limited. Also, don't make ""annoyance machines"".

**10.** Always obey the admins &amp; moderators (red color names). Report misbehaviour, grief, exploits and bugs to staff using the forum, pm's, or mumble. Do no bother them unnecessarily, and NEVER EVER bother us for op or admin rights.

**11.** Do not spam or do commercials for other servers or any commercial services. 

**12.** You will be eligible for a FREE protected plot in the main city. You have 10 days to have a proper building there (square wood/cobble box is not proper) after which it may be taken back to the state and given to someone else (extensions only on special circumstances). The free plot may be dug to bedrock, and built up to 15-20 above ground, depending on plot. Further promotion is dependent on your ability to finish a first build.

**13.** Mobtowers/XPgrinders etc are allowed in MODERATION. Preferably with an off-switch, and do not build in heavily populated areas. You are not allowed to let any mob stack up more than about 100 in a chunk (excessive stacking of monsters is cause for warning/demotion/ban!). Furthermore, towers must be covered and look like actual builds (not like flying platforms) - follow the building rules and some aesthetics please. No one wants to see giant cobble/wood cubes in the landscape. Besides, we have EasyEnchant, so there is little use for excessive XP grinding.

**14.** On your application to enter the server: Take the key number from rule #1 (in bold) and ADD it to the key number (also in bold) from rule #8, and write the sum as answer to the last question. Thank you for understanding we only do this to make sure people read the rules properly. You will love the result of it once you get inside.

1312963341.0,32,self.mcservers,jee69,Preventing Griefers: How to be an Effective Moderator,40,8,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/jee69/preventing_griefers_how_to_be_an_effective/,"This is not a post designed to teach how to start a server or install any plugins, the [side bar has an excellent post on how to do that stuff](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/jc1o0/subreddit_improvement_episode_1_minecraft_server/c2ayn01). The reader should also note that the majority of this post is about being an effective *Administrator* though moderation is thoroughly discussed (you happy, xul?).

This post is going to cover some of the mistakes I see a lot of administrators and moderators making in their servers that leads to a large amount of griefing. Hopefully other admins/mods out there take these points seriously.

* **Figure out the scope of the server and stick with it.** Do you want it to be survival or creative? Are you going to be a chaos server or one that is more conducive to building? Whatever you decide on, don't waver from it. If you decide to be a survival server, don't go spawning diamond blocks for yourself.
* **Research plugins that will help you achieve the type of server you want.** Go into multiple servers in /r/mcservers and type the command ""/plugins"", this will give you a list of all plugins that the server is using. Take note of what is on the server and google any that you are curious about. If you see the same plugins popping up in multiple servers, chances are they are very good and necessary. *Suggestions:* [NoCheat](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/sec-nocheat-v1-12b-detect-and-fight-the-exploitation-of-various-flaws-bugs-in-mc-1046.4523/), [BigBrother](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/sec-bigbrother-1-10-1-catch-griffers-red-handed-1000.12879/) (or [LogBlock](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/info-admin-logblock-v1-25-spout-bedrock-cheating-fix-find-those-damn-griefers-1000.4543/)), [LWC](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/sec-mech-lwc-v3-31-10-official-languages-lightweight-inventory-protection-management-1000.967/), Permissions and [PermissionsEx](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/admin-dev-permissionsex.13396/), and Help.
* **Be careful who you let in!** I personally hate whitelist, but that might be what you are looking for. Instead I prefer setting up a greylist. This means that anybody can join the server but have to specifically be given building privileges by an admin. Don't let any random joe schmoe join. I like to use this period as a trial period to see if said newbie would fit in with the server.
* **BE EVEN MORE CAREFUL WHO YOU LET MODERATE and what permissions you give people.** Do not just give mod status to the first people you see. Carefully comb over what permissions every single group has. Let the new guys use commands like /list, /help, /spawn, or /msg. I visited a server recently that let people who just joined use a command called ""/unlimited"" which gave them unlimited of ANY items (obviously unintended because /give was blocked). When figuring out if a person should be a moderator, I ask myself: 1) Do I really need another moderator?; 2) Has this person contributed to the server more than anyone else?; 3) Can I trust this person to keep a cool head in an emotionally charged conflict? [vsTerminus made a good point about moderators](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/jee69/preventing_griefers_how_to_be_an_effective/c2bfsdt).
* **Thoroughly test everything before you go live.** Run a test server off your computer, test out and learn different plugins, make sure changes don't break things. If the admin on the forementioned server had tested before going live, he wouldn't have had the problem.
* **Don't be a dick.** Don't be the admin who abuses their power because they can. Don't go crazy and mess with people just because. When you are assholes to people you will justify (at least in their eyes) griefing. It is your duty as a moderator to be level headed and smart about things. [This is a very good article on how to be a good moderator, despite it being meant for a forum board.](http://www.theadminzone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=6783)
* **Don't be a push over.** While you shouldn't be a douchebag, you definitely do not want to let potential griefers trick you. If someone blatantly breaks the rules, ban them and get on with your life. If it's a simple misunderstanding then let them go with a warning, but if they do it again, then feel free to kick them out of the server.
* **Visit other servers.** One of the most useful things I've done was go visit other servers and see how they moderate. I check the plugin list, ask questions about how they run the place. I've learned many of the tips listed above from just talking with people on other servers. *Red flags:* When exploring servers, note what annoys you as a newbie to a server. If it annoys you then it is definitely annoying people who visit your server (if you have a similar situation).
* **Be careful where you advertise.** I prefer only advertising on /r/mcservers because that is the demographic of people I like to have on my server. Keep in mind that the more places you advertise the more attention your server will get and the more likely you will have griefers at your front door. I'm not saying don't advertise, I'm just saying be careful with it.
* **Watch griefing videos.** This is perhaps one of the strangest, but most useful pieces of advice I can give you: it is extremely informative to regularly watch popular griefing teams to see the extent of what they can do. I'm talking about watching all or most of the videos out there. It's also an excellent way to learn how not to admin, by watching how bad moderators react to the griefers (overreacting, being douchebags, etc.). I also suggest signing up for [griefing forums](http://teamavolition.com/forums/), watch [stream chats](http://www.teamavolition.com/stream), and just generally keeping tabs on the griefing community. *Popular Griefing Teams*: [Team Avolition](http://www.youtube.com/teamavolition) and [AusMinecraftGriefers](http://www.youtube.com/user/AusMinecraftGriefers)
* **Accept that shit happens**: You cannot be perfect, so expect problems to stay hidden until you go live. Prepare for this by constantly making backups and have a safety net.

**Common Red Flags:**

This is a list of Redflags when observing either a visitor to your server (or even current members who are potentials for mod status):

* **Beggars**: Anybody who immediately (upon joining the server) and/or constantly asks for more privileges should be immediately suspect. While the chances are they are just impatient, you should be wary that most griefers don't have the patience to undergo an initiation/examining period before building. Plus do you really want someone so impatient on your server? Even if these people are legit, be wary of them because they may not deal with in stressful situations.
* **Mutes**: If someone joins/builds on your server for a while without talking, they may be griefers trying to not draw attention. However, it is very important to note that they could just not want to be chatting. Feel free to teleport to these quiet types and try to engage them in conversation (don't be a dick and just start questioning them, just the casual ""hey what's up"" is good).
* **Hold-My-Hand's**: These are those 12 or 13 year olds who non stop ask for help, get upset when people do not immediately respond to them. Not only do they scare away more mature players, these young-uns don't have much tolerance for the rules (or don't read/care for them). These are players who do not generally intend to grief, but some of them may grief inadvertently or out of frustration because they lost their items in lava or weren't spawned those diamonds.


Following these tips will not prevent griefers from knocking at your door, but at the very least you will be prepared to deal with them. Good luck and have fun!

-----------

*Edit*: On the topic of [mcbans](http://mcbans.com/), I have to say I am very against it. The concept of having a watch list for griefers is a good one, unfortunately in practice I have to put my faith in any admin out there who has mcbans installed in their server and hope that they are not being rash with their bans. From visiting many servers, I know that there are admins out there who ban anybody who disagrees with them.

**How fast can you win ordinary Minecraft?**

Let’s be honest. When you play on a normal survival map you can get to diamonds under 15 minutes and you probably have everything you ever need in a day. And then you’re so bored you try to blow up your friend’s house. Is this everything Minecraft has to offer?

How about you try some Flatcore.

Flatcore is a **hardcore survival** on a **superflat map**. Imagine a huge grass ocean, a home to dozens of slimes during day and hundreds of monsters at night. Imagine a map that wants you to curl in a ball die. Imagine a world where you have to get through to rare NPC villages to craft your first wooden sword and jumpstart your empire out of lava and water. You will be lucky if you find saplings to get more wood, too.

Flatcore is a game of smarts and logic. To create a safe base and powerful gear you have to use multiple renewable mechanisms available in game. You probably tried making charcoal but did you know you can use mushroom blocks as fuel? Have you ever been so lost and hungry in Nether you started a waterless melon farm in a cave? Did you know how to light a nether portal without flint &amp; steel? You will, once you are hooked on Flatcore.

But that’s not all. **When you** (inevitably) **die, you go to [Limbo](http://imgur.com/a/fkfuU#6)**.

It’s a 1 hour timeout in an eerie place where you can try to beat challenges to be released early. Finish the vertigo-inducing Parkour or win the brand new and vicious [Death Pit](http://i.imgur.com/HEvimc1.jpg) to be released and keep playing. So don’t even think about killing yourself to replenish hunger. Survive at all cost!

Flatcore is a player versus environment kind of a game so come online and have some fun with us.

_(Yes, we’re on 1.6.2!)_

**Unique features:**

1. Your skill decides of your rank. A completely unique take on ranks where you do weekly challenges to get points and climb the ladder of promotions.
2. Staff plays legitimately among players. If we have to help, we switch to a duty mode with separate inventory.
3. Completely custom and automated system for resetting villages. You can join whenever and you will still be able to find unraided villages.

""Offline mode"" means it does not auth checking to the main Minecraft servers. This means you can log in to a ""cracked"" server with any username you like if you use a cracked client.

People write ""cracked"" when they just mean ""offline"" mode.

The server has been completely rebuilt from the ground up with many player suggested features and optizmations included. The server features a fresh, fully generated world to explore and wage war over.  May the best faction win!

-----------

Minecraft Wars is the idea of playing minecraft with a strategic mindset. Through the use of a plugin called Factions, players can group up to form city-states and compete for dominance over a vast world and multiverse.  A Faction can be destroyed if their leader's power is dropped to the minimum (*-20*) at your hands!  Once the leader is out of power, the faction is disbanded and all territory controlled, is removed.  You lose 4 power on each death and power will regenerate over time.

Factions gain power for each player added. The amount of power added to the faction decreases the more players the faction has.  A faction can be sieged with TNT cannons only when it's members are online, the explosion protection turns on after the last member is offline for at least 10 minutes.

Factions can form strategic alliances with one and another. Leaders are able to customize how other factions, and members of their own faction interact with their territory for ultimate control.  

Over time, we will be rolling out various specialize PvP maps, available via special multiverse portals for special competitions of PvP skill for rewards and resources.


There are many plugins installed on the server to offer a varied style of gameplay. Some other noteable plguins include: 

* mcMMO -Offers a Role Playing like skill system to the game.
* CreativeGates -Make portals for instant travel between any two locations on the server.
* Multiverse -Many worlds to explore and conquer.
* iConomy -Player Wallets and economy system.
* Jobs -Players can join a job to earn money by mining, farming and crafting.
* ChestShop -Factions can create shops at spawn to trade valuable materials.
* HeroBounty -Place bounties on other players, or hunt targets for cubecoins.
* TopPVP -Keeps track of the number deaths and kills each player has.
* Falsebook -Create redstone circuits with Intergrated Circuits for more compact and complex designs.
* LavaFurnace -Power furnaces with lava and utilize production chests for advanced smelting.
* Spout -Server and Client software that adds some nifty features to Factions and mcMMO.
* and many, many more!

I started a server loosely based on the Apocalypse idea from this subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/minerapocalypse/

The basic premise is that you spawn in a random location in the world, and there is no global chat. You are free to use local chat to seek out others and build a civilization, or live on your own.

Death results in a 6 hour ban, so there is some incentive to avoid dying. I'm hoping that this along with a white-list will help reduce the number of griefers.

If you're interested in being added to the white-list, post a reply here or send me a message with:

Golden Realm is a US based server with our peak times usually on weekday nights at 9-12 pm EST. We are a tight knit community who enjoy playing Vanilla Minecraft in a multiplayer setting. This is an 18+ community that has been around since last September, with very little tolerance for immaturity. There are other servers like us, but our community is our biggest asset and what makes GR so fun and enjoyable to play on. There are usually 20 people online and 8-10 people in mumble on any average night (our mumble server information can be found on our subreddits side bar). There are no plugins that affect your gameplay other than LWC (chest protection) and the occasional Mob Arena.

Golden Realm reset the map with the 1.6 update and there is plenty of new space to be explored and built upon. 

Feel free to play on GR how you like. There are many people who enjoy building community structures and participating in our many server events such as: PVP, Fireworks shows, MobArena and many more. We also have many talented builders and redstoners who like to build alone, which is also more then welcome. We are currently running 1.6.2 so you’re free to enjoy all of the features that go with 1.6.2. If you should have any questions we have a very capable staff of moderators and admins who are online though most of the day. 

We have a zero tolerance policy for griefing here at Golden Realm. Please note that violators of this rule will be banned on a first offence. Multiple anti-griefing plugins are installed and everything is tracked while you are in game. You do not have to worry about being griefed or harassed when you play on GR, most of us have busy lives so we do not put up with verbal or in game harassing. Moderators are quick to jump on any such problems that may arise.

If you want to see what Golden Realm is like before you apply for whitelist, feel free to go to our dynmap. You won’t be able to chat but you can read and watch everything to get a feel for the map and the community.

I wanted to be paranoid, all the time.  Always on the lookout for nameplates in the distance, ensuring that I'm not being spotted and my base of operations found out.

My ideal server right now would run sort of like this:

 * Run like hell from spawn in some direction.
 * Get as much wood as quickly as possible, and some coal.
 * Dig a hidey-hole in some unassuming spot and seal it off.  Keep it a goddamn secret at all costs.
 * Gather goodies, implements of destruction.
 * Find other bases, kill everyone, take everything, then burn it/blow it up.
 * Repeat until we have the audacity to carve a golden skull into some clearly visible cliff face.
 * Trap said garishly decorated base.  Cackle madly as siege members die.

Seriously.  It should be like Mad Max or Waterworld.  No /give from admins, no being able to easily teleport.  If you want an opulent base, you're going to have to defend it to the death, and risk it being destroyed when you log out.  Extreme paranoia at all times.

I speak from my own experiences running a large public server, but feel free to correct or disagree with me or add even more to this already large guide! This isn't a technical guide: if you want one of those there are several really great ones on the [Minecraft Forums](http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewforum.php?f=1013).

This advice is for people who want to start and run an SMP server for PUBLIC users to join and the things you will need to think about. It's been updated to make sense for the latest server software 1.3.2 and client 1.0.17_04.

** The Hardware **

Minecraft shouldn't need a really good system, but it does. It depends how big you want your player limit to be, but don't forget that the system will also need to do regular backups of a map that can get very large, very quickly. 

* Playing a public server on a home computer only works if you're looking at under 10 player slots and not being able to use your computer for much else. You'll also need at least 4GB of ram and a decent CPU. Otherwise, you'll need to buy a server.

* Shared servers are NOT an option for Minecraft as it loves to bug out and use a massive amount of system resources. You need to get a dedicated, and unless you're going to be using it for other things, this will cost a fair amount of money - much more than you would usually spend on a game server. A good guess for a medium sized server is about $100-$180 a month.

* It's not all about playerlimit but what you're doing in the game. You'll use more resources discovering new land or setting things on fire than you will just sitting near spawn and building a house.

** The Software **

Anyone who thinks SMP is 'buggy' has obviously never had to deal with the server software, which is probably the buggiest thing ever. You will need to manually restart the server often, deal with cryptic bugs and messages and generally be around most of the time if you want your server to be online. I strongly recommend starting a server with a couple of friends who all have access so you can restart it as easily as possible.

* It'll get buggier the more you use scripts, but scripts are very necessary for the game experience right now. Vanilla servers shouldn't run into many problems. Servers running two or more scripts together are going to run into at least some stability issues.

* The server loves to 'hang' rather than 'crash' when something goes wrong. This means you don't always know when things have happened until you try to log in. It makes auto restarts difficult as well, so just setting up a script to make things wrong isn't really an option in my experience.

* Several things will currently totally rape the server software. Minecarts are likely to lag or crash clients and the game and large scale fires will utterly destroy a server. Map backups can also take a fair amount of resources.

* Backups are 100% necessary however. Map corruption WILL happen. It's happened to use once and to every server owner we know at some point. Generally it will happen from map generation, so the more people playing the more likely it will be. It can be fixed, but it's a big pain.

** The griefers **

Public servers will get griefed. This is unavoidable, but you can control the grief by setting up a number of different anti-grief systems.

* The BEST solution, of course, is not to be public. You can use scripts to run a white-list of players and get them to apply before joining, or you can run a semi-private server that has 'public days' when you know you or other staff will be online. 

* Or you can set up spawn as a 'jail' made from bedrock which people are stuck in until you teleport them out. This can work well but it's an extreme measure, hardly very friendly and relies on you or another person with moderation commands to be online.

* The third option is to use a rank system where different items are banned. On our server, we don't let new users use water, lava or obsidian and we have bedrock and minecarts totally banned. Several mods can do this, see below.

* [World of Minecraft](http://www.worldofminecraft.com/Minecraft_Griefers) has a list of 'known griefers'. You put this in your ban list to ban about 8,000 people but remember that this doesn't mean they really are griefers. They may have just annoyed another server owner or disobyed a rule that you might not even have. We've banned everyone on this list but allow people to state their case on our forums.

* The only real way to stop griefers on a public server is to have plenty of staff and users who are willing to help repair problems and report griefers. Even using a ranking system people can still mess up the world if they are determined enough or not caught quickly.

** The Mods **

* Server mods are VITAL if you want to properly run a server. There are plenty around and people use a different mix. Here's some of the ones we use, if anyone else uses different ones I'll happily add them.

[Llamacraft](http://www.minecraftforum.net): Fixes all the really bugs with SMP right now, such as furnaces dying randomly and water buckets not actually making source blocks.

[Hey0](http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1012&amp;t=23340): Adds a bunch of fixes and moderator / server commands that are very, very useful.

[Simple Server Wrapper](http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1012&amp;t=27756&amp;hilit=spiegal): Not widely used but this has been amazing as a firewall to ban blocks from certain users. Using this script has massively reduced griefing in our server.

* The more mods you use, the more likely the game will become unstable so only use the ones that are TOTALLY necessary. Mods update and change fast so explore the Minecraft forums before you choose which ones to use.

** The Management **

Running and maintaining a server is one thing, but actually making it fun to play on and popular is quite another. Here's some stuff that's helped us out.

* Run a website, even if its just a crappy Wordpress page or a link directly to a forum. This is VITAL to organise community projects, big builds and communicate with players. You can use it to say if/why your server is down, which people really like and very few servers actually do. You can also put your rules online and refer people to them rather than trying to explain them every time.

* Get staff. Promote trusted players to use more commands, especially ones like /ban and /tp to help combat griefers. Make sure you can trust them, but don't hold back - the more staff your server has the more organised it will feel and the more fun it will be for others to play on. For our server which has around 200 regular users, we have around 25 staff members, including 3 people with direct access to the server and always look for more.

* Decide on a focus and stick with it. Try to be original, but don't worry too much. Just keeping your server online often and free from as much as much griefing as possible will put you in the top 25% of Minecraft servers.

* Make your rules and stick to them. On a public server you don't want to be too strict. Don't make rules you can't possibly enforce.

* Don't be an asshole. This sounds simple but you would be amazed how many members of the Minecraft community forget. Nobody wants to play on a server run by someone who acts like an tyrant or lets everyone get away with griefing. Be friendly, polite and enjoy yourself, otherwise, what's the point?",,False,self,t5_2s3kg,True,,,True,t3_db2dz,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/db2dz/guide_running_a_public_server/,

**Description:** Bloopcraft is an RPG styled private minecraft community. We're currently undergoing some heavy changes.  The server's core gameplay is still standard SMP and we won't be changing that... However we're adding elements that will help the world feel more like a bustling RPG and less like an empty sandbox.
Here are some of the things we're incorporating that add on to the vanilla experience:

* Economy: Most server economies command based, these definitely don't fit into an RPG setting. We use the shopkeepers plugin. Centered around having a villager as your shopkeeper, the interface is exactly the same as NPC villager shops, but the inventory is set by the player. This plugin blends seamlessly into the world allowing players to trade while offline.

* Towns: We don't use towny or any other border setting plugins (with the exception of the world border). Instead we're taking a different approach to building, the creator of the town gets to set the rules for his town. These town rules can be admin enforced if players ignore town owners. Don't like a town's rules? find a town that suits you, start your own, or build in the wild.

* Pvp &amp; Factions: Faction plugins are bulky so we've decided against all faction plugins. Instead factions will be verbal agreements. Made some friends on the server and now you want to play together? feel free to call yourselves a faction, Build a town together and restrict it to just your faction if you like. So what's the real benefit to having a faction? well that comes into play with the anarchy...

* Anarchy: A second overworld that gets reset often. The purpose  of the anarchy world is to bring fresh resources (we have a border set on the world and don't plan on restarting it). There are no rules on the anarchy world so thieves will try to take your resources. Having a faction allows you to work together while gathering resources to bring back to the main world, without a faction the danger is increased and you're susceptible to being hunted by other factions.

* Events &amp; Quests: There are a wide range of server events that are planned and scheduled to give players extra activities outside of the norm. Quests will normally be incorporated into dungeons which will automatically switch players into adventure mode. These will reward players with both experience and emeralds to the players.

* Lore: We're writing a backstory to the server and plan on having books scattered throughout the land similar to the elder scrolls universe. Some of these will hint at quests, others will be for fun.
These are just some of the things we're incorporating, it's important to note that none of the changes affect the core gameplay, we tried to avoid as many plugins as possible while adding content.

**Rules**: No Grief/Theft!; No profanity; No advertising; No exploits; No Mob Grinders; Respect your peers.

* Description: AmishSMP is a full-throttled hardcore, 7-day deathban experience. The deathban adds a sense of danger and urgency, as one false step can lead to disaster. Players spawn with a sparse starter's pack and a limited amount of newbie-protection (from pvp). They may then set out an establish a base, get food, and survive. Note that there is no land protection, and griefing and stealing are fine. Everything goes in this world, and a player can make of it what they want. Those seeking hardcore pvp can gear up and hunt down other players. Those who are more creatively inclined can work towards building wonders, with the risk of death always in the back of their mind.

**Description**: Legitmine is a community-based server inspired by the gameplay of true Minecraft. We don't spawn items on the server, everything outside spawn is handmade.
While mostly a vanilla experience, some things have been changed to compensate for the modern Minecraft experience:

* We run a carefully balanced mob-based economy, with a possibility for buying any normally obtainable items (shops in progress!)
* We do have a strict no-griefing policy, and this rule will be enforced. Your structures are safe, if they are griefed it can be undone and fixed near instantly by the staff, just contact them. 
* PvP will be available in community-built arenas.

We are running on an almost new map, there is an entire unexplored world waiting out there to be colonized! 

The map can be viewed from http://map.legitmine.net

**Rules**:

* Rule #1: Be civil in chat and everywhere else - no caps, hate speech, racism, sexism, or slurs.

* Rule #2: No griefing, mods/cheats, or harassment - violators will be banned. Appeal at legitmine.net.

* Rule #3: You are responsible for your account - we don't accept excuses that your friend/sibling etc griefed.

* Rule #4: We are a 'legit' server - no tp, give, fly, etc. If you have to ask if you can do it, the answer is probably ""no.""

Trees, grass, animals are rare. Monsters are highly aggressive and are stronger then normal. Survival will be tough, this server is not for those that do not want a challenge.

We have server shops for players to peddle their wares. We even have safe-zone plots in the spawn for the wealthy to buy and contribute to the server spawn.

PvP, and survival not your thing? We have a massive multi-level maze to conquer. And a prison server in the making.

I have been on the ChosenCraft server for less than 2 weeks and I was banned for ""hacked client"", but that isn't even the start of the issues I have with this server.

The mods that are under 15 years old like to abuse their power.  There was a group of 8-10 of us on the server and 3 were taking advantage of a voting glitch that A. got the server more recognized, B. got them diamonds, it was a win-win and the server owner told them they could do so, as long as they were out of the lottery.  Mods did not like that our group then started working together to make money and buy plots in a city together.  They would teleport to us all of the time while strip mining and continue warning us that we would find too many diamonds...

Anyway first experience that I had with getting in ""trouble"" was minor grief, 1. I was not told when and where I griefed(even though I had no clue) and 2. instead of the normal 1-2 hours for minor grief I got an entire day.  Seems unfair, but w/e it was a day.

Next day I log on I'm stuck in a giant prison made of bedrock with 4 signs saying along the lines of ""your group has too much money from working together, we don't like that so we're gonna take everything you have and wreck your houses and make it seem like an investigation.""  Wasn't too happy with that, but a newly appointed mod helped me out of there and I went back to mining.

Last straw was hours after I was out, I was back to mining, just strip mining finding a couple diamond deposits.  The same mod that let me out of the prison checks on me, because I found too many diamonds.  He checks my progress and tells me I'm in the clear(just to clarify I mine in one direction until I find lava, then just change to left or right all while mining in a 2x2 square)  A few minutes later another mod teleports to me and checks on me, I ask him what was wrong, no more than 2 seconds later I'm banned for ""hacked client this was your last chance""

... In the span of 2 days I went from normal jailed to banned, because of having friends work together and being a lucky miner...

As for hacked client, I do have mods for single player, including Industrial craft 2, Buildcraft, RedstonePower, Rei's Minimap, TreeCapinator, Inventory Tweaks, and additional pipes for Buildcraft.  The only two of these that even made a difference on the server were Rei's minimap and Inventory Tweaks, which had no effect on the amount of diamonds I would find anyway.

TL:DR So in conclusion, don't join this server with more than 4 friends or the mods will accuse you of cheating/hacking and you will go from 0 to banned in less than 3 days.

But if anyone would like to tell me if I was in the wrong please point out flaws in my argument that this server should be avoided.",,False,self,t5_2s3kg,False,,,True,t3_p2ybz,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/p2ybz/chosencraft_a_server_to_avoid/,

I’m a regular on [MCNSA](http://mcnsa.com)’s RPG server inviting you to join. 

_Edit: we’re looking for **regular players** who can take care of themselves. If you’re not an advanced Minecraft player, this server is not for you. There is no hand-holding, no handouts and nobody will help you get to places or other people._

==================================== 
# What is RPG / mcMMO? 
====================================

If you haven’t heard about mcMMO, it’s a server-side plugin expanding game mechanics **without** any client-side modifications necessary. It makes standard activities (like mining, farming, fighting) more interesting by adding [experience points and special skills](http://i.imgur.com/VC7yM.png) acquired when leveling up.

[The full list of skills and abilities](http://mcmmo.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Skills) is listed on mcMMO’s wiki page and I urge you to flip through as you can learn how to play effectively in minutes.

==================================== 
# Server “rules” 
====================================

This is a flavor of a chaos server because you are allowed (though not encouraged) to kill other players, steal their things and grief their homes. There are no moderators and you can only be banned by repeatedly asking for items and spamming chat. Type **/rules** to learn more.

You can also lock 3 chests and 2 furnaces.

==================================== 
# Player’s toolkit 
====================================

You can use following commands:

* **/spawn** – teleports you to spawn
* **/time** – shows in-game time
* **/stats** – lists all skills and their level + experience
* **/cprivate** – lock a chest (or furnace, doors, etc). 3 items limit
* **/[skill name]** (for example: /mining) – lists details about skills
* **/mctop** – Top 10 Players
* **/mctop [skill name]** (for example: /mctop mining) – Top 10 Players for specific skill
* /mcc – find out more about mcMMO

To set your home / respawn place, use a bed.

==================================== 
# Server’s info 
====================================

Server is located in USA and runs 24/7 on powerful hardware (lots of RAM, SSD disk).

IP: **mcnsa.com:1111**

====================================

**tl;dr** – This is a survival server with RPG leveling and skills. You can grief, steal and kill. Read the description above to learn how leveling up works.",,False,self,t5_2s3kg,True,,,True,t3_iycbj,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/iycbj/rpg_survival_server_mcmmo_with_a_dash_of_chaos/,

**Description:** Age limit 15+! No Map Resets! Very Build Friendly settings! Protected Building! High Quality Special Projects! Adventures with custom adventure setup! Treasure Hunts! Full View Distance! Lots of Redditors ...and the Friendliest Staff and Community you will ever find! Tourists may play ""Freedom"" (survival world with Grief Prevention), Survival Games, The Dropper. For all world access; registration and application on the forum is required as this assures higher quality and less griefing and player issues.


**Rules:** 

**Important rule #1**: This server is intended for mature adults with more than half a brain and we expect EVERYONE here to behave accordingly. You must be at least 15 years of age to be considered for membership.

**2.** Be courteous and respect others. Agree to disagree. No fighting, namecalling etc. This includes not heckling or demeaning lower ranks or the Tourists!

**3.** Real world legal and societal laws and rules apply! Just use your common sense, if somebody would not like if you did it in the real world - don't do it here.

**4.** No exploits, duping, cheating, stealing, griefing etc. You get ONE chance not to do that on this server! That means no cheat clients, especially no xray/ore finders. Cheaters, thieves and vandals do not belong here. We log all block and chest interactions and will BAN you! Do not peek into chests that belong to someone. Treasure chests (marked and notified on opening) are per player and you are expected to loot those when found (we have quite a few hidden).

**5.** Leave the landscape looking natural and beautiful please. Terraform to your hearts content, but: All trees must be cut down fully, leave no tall pillars, floating junk midair, screwed up water or ugly beaches/deserts anywhere please.

**6.** No giant pixelart, voxelart, letters, flags etc (statues and real ""builds"" are ok) in the regular worlds (creative play area is the only place you may build those).

**7.** Build with some taste please: Avoid large featureless walls/floors of cobble/dirt/birch/lava etc.

**8.** Aim to build within reasonable distance from each other. Minimum distance before it is customary to ask for permission is 128 blocks (=Normal Render Distance), you can also measure this with string.

**9.** Make sure large redstone creations or machinery is turned off when not in use. We have a very powerful server, but it is still limited. Also, don't make ""annoyance machines"".

**10.** Always obey the admins &amp; moderators (red color names). Report misbehaviour, grief, exploits and bugs to staff using the forum, pm's, or mumble. Do no bother them unnecessarily, and NEVER EVER bother us for op or admin rights.

**11.** Do not spam or do commercials for other servers or any commercial services. 

**12.** You will be eligible for a FREE protected plot in the main city. You have 10 days to have a proper building there (square wood/cobble box is not proper) after which it may be taken back to the state and given to someone else (extensions only on special circumstances). The free plot may be dug to bedrock, and built up to 15-20 above ground, depending on plot. Further promotion is dependent on your ability to finish a first build.

**13.** Mobtowers/XPgrinders etc are allowed in MODERATION. Preferably with an off-switch, and do not build in heavily populated areas. You are not allowed to let any mob stack up more than about 100 in a chunk (excessive stacking of monsters is cause for warning/demotion/ban!). Furthermore, towers must be covered and look like actual builds (not like flying platforms) - follow the building rules and some aesthetics please. No one wants to see giant cobble/wood cubes in the landscape. Besides, we have EasyEnchant, so there is little use for excessive XP grinding.

**14.** On your application to enter the server: Take the key number from rule #1 (in bold) and ADD it to the key number (also in bold) from rule #8, and write the sum as answer to the last question. Thank you for understanding we only do this to make sure people read the rules properly. You will love the result of it once you get inside.

**15.** Before starting to ask a lot of questions, read the Newcomer's guide. If your question is not answered there. When you do need to ask a question, do not ask for permission to ask a question or ask for an admin by name. Just ask the question straight away, chances are someone will answer it. Please do not repeat or spam questions again and again in the chat.

Yesterday, under the joint decision of /r/AdminCraft &amp; /r/MCServers, we created a subreddit called /r/MCStaff. It is a place where people can post advertisements for staff positions on their Minecraft servers. It's also a place for people to post that they're looking for a new staff to join.

The subreddit is being run in collaboration by /r/AdminCraft and /r/MCServers. Both subreddits get posts where people are looking for new staff members, but neither feel like that belongs in their subreddit. We decided to fill the gap.

The subreddit is brand spanking new so it's going to take us some time to figure out best practices for posting guidelines/rules/etc. Please be patient with the mods while we get the ball rolling. If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment on this post, and we will do our best to answer it.

Thanks!

We, the admins who brought you mau5ville.com (deadmau5's server), have decided to branch out with our own project since mau5ville is indefinitely down. 

Basically, we've decided to make our private awesome build server into something much bigger. Now, after some hard work, we are a 256 slot creative server with several maps and some amazing builds already. 

The first couple of maps you'll have access to are a vanilla survival map, and a creative plot world. These are designed as proving grounds for new members, and also a place where even the biggest projects can be easily set up. Good builders who show potential will be granted access to a freebuild map named artharor, and a space map for all your space building needs.

1.) A state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority.
2.) Absence of government and absolute freedom of the individual, regarded as a political ideal.
That would imply that there are no moderators, no land protection, no plugins except ones to prevent players from going outside of the games natural limitations (as in, NoCheat and Spamhammer and nothing else.)
To be clear, I don't mind servers with moderation. I'm more of an anarchy person myself, but I understand why there would be moderation on a server. But to call a server anarchy and have moderators and admins is retarded. And furthermore, it's just a massive superiority complex situation for the admins.

And before anybody says ""Moderators are required for an anarchy server to work right! Otherwise hackers would mess things up!"" I'd like to present 2b2t.net as evidence that NoCheat and an antispam plugin such as Spamhammer are more than enough to keep gameplay fair. And there are no moderators.

This world has been up over a year and there are no plans to take it down, though we do expand it from time to time. We have a live map. http://mc.digstraightdown.com:15566/

Ages 18+ only.

Rules: No griefing, no stealing, no mods that affect gameplay. PVP is off except in our new Arena. Treat everyone with respect.

Server Hardware: commercially hosted. SSD hardware.

Plugins: there are fewer than 20 plugins, including Essentials, logblock, and others. We try to keep plugins to a minimum to minimize lag.

* **Description**: 

Welcome to the Blocktopia server cluster, now accessible through one convenient address.  Blocktopia is one of the oldest minecraft communities, and was founded back in the alpha days pre-SMP.  Initially Blocktopia focused on the development of a first batch of classic servers, introducing lava survival, zombie survival, and TNT combat.  Each one of these servers has enjoyed long-term success, but as the classic minecraft community continues to lose support and interest the Blocktopia devs have been hard at work recreating each of these servers for premium Minecraft. The result has been the development of four unique minecraft servers:  

* **Rituals of Fire [Lava Survival PvE]** 

* **Army of Darkness [Infection PvP]**

* **BuildBox [Creative]** 

* **Journey to Elysium [SMP]**

Each one of these servers may be accessed through the central hub at **lobby.blocktopia.net**

This lobby is a new development, and we anticipate adding activities for the community while you wait on friends.

Once you connect to the lobby, you will see four portals, one on each side.  Each portal will connect you to a separate server.

**If you wish to return to the lobby and select another game type, use the /logout command.**  Or simply disconnect and reconnect.


Descriptions of the individual servers are as follows:

* **Rituals of Fire [PvE]**

Rituals of Fire is an upgraded lava survival experience.  Here players must cooperate and work together to escape and survive the rising lava tides.  The server contains a collection of survival maps and a main lobby.  Players have the option of sitting rounds out and working on their gear in the main lobby, and may join the game in progress through the central portal at any time.  While in the map, players are given a few minutes to collect needed resources and begin to build their forts.  Lava then begins to release gradually throughout the map, and the server will broadcast when the next wave begins.  Each map has its own twists and turns.

Players who survive the lava are rewarded with cookies, which allow for the purchase of new ranks and items.  Higher ranks allow for faster cookie accumulation, as well as access to enderchests, enchantments, and special crafting rooms.

In between rounds players are encouraged to duke it out on King of the Ladder.  Whoever sits atop the ladder the longest is awarded various goodies.  If you die you retain your items so don't stress out.

Some impressions here [http://imgur.com/a/RETsV](http://imgur.com/a/RETsV)

* **Army of Darkness [PvP]**

Army of Darkness is the replacement for the classic Zombie and TNT wars servers.  The gameplay is infection PvP with a minecraft twist.  Maps are randomly selected from a pool of about 40, and Survivors are given a few minutes to explore the map, gather resources, and hunt down items located in chests throughout the map.  After time is up, the survivors are no longer able to gather resources and a Dark Hunter is randomly selected.  Survivors who die are transformed into hunters, and the round continues until either all of the survivors perish or the round time expires (6-10 minutes).

Each map is designed to focus on a different gameplay aspect, from parkour to TNT to archery.  The map authors create pre-built kits that are assigned upon player spawn that fit the theme and help assist new players.  Gear is reset completely between rounds to ensure that the playing field remains level - no donators in full enchanted diamond running around here!  Anyone is welcome to jump in and play.

Renders of a few of the AoD maps may be seen here: [http://imgur.com/a/4vW2a](http://imgur.com/a/4vW2a)

* **BuildBox [Creative]**

Both of the two previous servers feature multiple maps created within the community.  To encourage new map makers and provide a creative outlet for the community the BuildBox is available for any would-be mapmaker or anyone who simply wants to build something amazing.  Here players are allowed to create their own plots in which they are allowed access to WorldEdit commands (and VoxelSniper for the trusted players).  

Anything built here may be exported as a schematic and downloaded at the community site, so your builds may endure forever.  They may also be exported for use on the RoF and AoD servers if they are approved by volunteer staff members who will review your submissions and recommend changes if necessary.

The livemap may be seen here: [http://smp.blocktopia.net/buildbox/#](http://smp.blocktopia.net/buildbox/#)

* **Journey to Elysium [SMP]** 

This final server is also the newest and most popular, and offers players the chance to build their own communities and towns.  Journey to Elysium is a SMP-focused server with several existing towns, NPCs, a booming emerald economy, and PvP + PvE regions.  This allows players to focus on building their worlds without fear of griefers thanks to various plugins, or cross the great ice wall into the PvP regions and duke it out.  Established villages and towns are marked on the livemap.

* **Rules**: Rules vary per server, and may typically be viewed with /rules.  Please take the time to review them, and ask if you have any questions.  Hacking, griefing, personal insults, and general asshattery are universally discouraged across all of the Blocktopia servers.

More details inside.",21,7,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/vnbp3/hello_were_a_group_of_mature_friendly_players/,"Hey /r/mcservers, we're a group of mature and friendly players looking for any new nice and mature builders to join us! Our gaming and development community is legally registered as a non-profit organization in California and 100% funded by our active members. We mostly congregate on our Minecraft Creative server and our Mumble voice chat server, though most of us also play other games together.


On the server, we mainly gather together to build crazy things, show off our individual projects or learn something new about the game and its development everyday. As well, every weekend or so, we have an Events server which we use to host various adventure maps or PvP arena type games (for example, we've had our version of the Hunger Games in Minecraft and we also have a Race for the Wool League planned for the future) for the community to enjoy. We also have a whitelisted survival server for members of a certain rank.


The server itself has many features, but most of all, we pride ourselves in our fair organization, and a group of fantastic, tight-knit and mature members. Our staff of over a dozen active moderators, devs and admins are experienced (majority of which having moderated for over a year and all been playing since Alpha or early Beta), just, and, take this as you will, all at least over the age of 20. Our ingame chat system is hooked to an IRC server and we have other cool little plugins that make the place unique.


The server has no whitelist, however, we use a ranking system to curb griefing and encourage good behaviour. Advancing through the ranks will unlock new building tools for players (and eventually Creative mode) and is solely based on merit such as building skills and friendly attitude, as such not everyone will get a rank up; donating money to us, though very welcome and encouraged, is not a necessity in advancing through the ranks and unlocking new tools (you are instead given different cosmetic perks ingame for recognition). If you wish to build on the server and join our community, I invite you to read all the signs ingame and consult our forums for more detailed information. Be warned, we don't accept all new players, though if you are an even remotely good, mature, patient and understanding builder, you should have no problems getting your first rank up.


Make sure you understand the rules! The basic ones are: use common sense, be nice, don't swear, and don't use any client modifications not specifically approved in our forums. Ingame, type ""/help"", ""/faq"", and read the signs in spawn to get you started! A forewarning though: we don't take kindly to immature and asinine behaviour. Please don't act like a typical conceitedly entitled 14 year old.

For building (everyone loves building) have automated builders that would upgrade building from pre-made blueprints (Have player contests monthly to determine a seperate design/new tier of building, you could get very complex with this) Maybe have an ""outlaw"" class and a police force to combat them?

The thing that makes this concept different is that that would be the ONLY thing you did on the server. Sounds boring right? Nope, you'd have to find a distributor, a market for what you want, a market to sell things, and then people would actually have to buy stuff. 

Thanks to **BEARCASTLE** for making this amazing list: 

**Resource-based:**


Lumberjack - Arboretum Master, Fletcher (Bow/Arrows)


Miner - Ore Specialist, Excavator


Blacksmith - Technician (Redstone), Weapons Forger (Swords, Picks, etc)


Farmer - Butcher, Agriculture Farmer, Herbalist (Any non-edible sources like flowers, cacti, and dye products)


**Fighting-based:**


Hunter - Archer, Swordsman, Headhunter (Bounty Hunter against enemy factions)


Adventurer - Guide, Woodsman, Forester (Someone who knows what biomes where and gets intel on the land, and can be hired to escort you and watch out for you while you work)


Thief - Mercenary (Someone hired to kill enemy players for pay, similar to Headhunter but keeps spoils for himself), 


Spy (Someone who infiltrates enemy bases to keep track of their progress)


Guard - Kings Guard (protects city from enemy) Watchmen (patrols against raids, commonly seen outside of the walls and going to outside territories to keep enemy gatherers out of their territory)


**Trade-based:**


Builder - Specific builder (specializes in one style/building), Architect (general builder who largely plans and hires specific builders)


Potions Maker - Alchemist, Druid, Priest


Salesman - Specific Salesman, General Salesman


Ambassador (if we decide on cities) - Elders (rule-makers) and Kings (commands guards/fighters)


Merchant (The difference between Salesmen and Merchants is Merchants would be between cities, and for the most part sell finished items, while Salesmen would sell resource products like wood and stone)

&gt;The basic premise is that you spawn in a random location in the world, and there is no global chat. You are free to use local chat to seek out others and build a civilization, or live on your own.
Death results in a 6 hour ban, so there is some incentive to avoid dying. I'm hoping that this along with a white-list will help reduce the number of griefers.

Summary:

- 6 hour deathban
- Random spawn
- Local chat
- ~~Towny~~ Edit: We are moving to Factions
- Pregenerated land currently 9000x9000
- Only rule is no cobble pouring

**The Factions:**

The Warring Factions:
Orsana City Faction: We are the civilized people living in under a Single Lordship who seeks to improve our daily life. Under his rule building codes and plot dimensions are strictly enforced, but it is for the better of all. Obey the simple rules of the City and Prosper. Olat the Lord of Orsana has begun expansion into the wilderness clearing forests for roads and settlement expansion. This has so enraged the Raghnall Tribe and these two are now at WAR.

 
  Raghnall Tribe: Inspired by Fantasy legend and lore of the Nordic / Viking population this tribe of ruthless warriors are a Mountainous people that feel the ever expanding boundaries of Orsana is creeping into their domain. Enraged at the destruction of land and their home they have Declared WAR on the people of Orsana. Trikan the ruthless leader has 2 small limitations, no massive structures and you must adhere to the Viking / Nord code. (IE Mainly Wood with small amounts of stone mixed into your buildings.)

  The Neutrals:
Merchant Guild: The merchant guild is a neutral party that takes it pride in Trading and Architecture skills. They assist in the war effort by supplying each faction with materials. Merchant Coast will be a NO PVP zone. You will trade gold bars or Blocks for Items of your choice. Items that will be supplied, Armor, Weapons, even rare items from the Nether. You can also hire the Architectural Genius's to build structures in your land. If building and creativity is what you want, the Merchant Guild is for you.
 
 In Server Currency: Use gold ignots and Gold Blocks to buy from the Merchant Guild, Contract them out to build Amazing buildings for you, intricate traps, and other things! But Nether Only items from them for your use... Glowstone, SoulSand, Nether-rack! Got killed in a gank or skirmish? Out of materials? Buy new stuff from them!

We've be running since before this server list existed, have 1,500 forum members and some 200 regulars, usually resulting in between 20-40 people playing at all times of the day.

We have a great staff, many of whom are Redditors, and the staff have to follow all the same rules as users. We don't put up with any racism, homophobia or any of that nonsense, and we don't spawn blocks and mess with users for fun.

We have zero tolerance for griefing and stealing and have plugins and staff to deal with things. It's very rare a staff member isn't online, and we have a full forum ticket system for users to resolve problems online.

We don't accept donations or give donators more powers than regular users, we have a VIP system but its based purely on your contribution to the community.

We have a number of plugins installed to make life easier, like Craftbook, chest protection and Minecart Mania. We don't go crazy with plugins though, and tend to only use one that fix problems or are in the spirit of Minecraft. We also have our own custom code to integrate forum activity, whitelist users, administrate and make things easier for players.

We have a large 'carebear' zone for people who don't want to fight monsters all day and just like to build, and outside that zone we have a wilderness where you can survive and get attacked by mobs.

So yeah. If you're tired of servers that don't put everyone on equal ground, or close after two weeks, or can't handle more than 20 players at once, hit us up. We could do with more Redditors!

Hopefully it'll give you a great idea of how we play, and anything else you might wonder about us and if we're really the for you. I suggest reading everything to ensure this is the place you want to play, but skip to the TL;DR if you'd rather read that.



-.

Anywho, I’ll give you a little backstory of our server. June of 2011 we began as a group of Real Life friends just looking to play together online. We’ve been around for over two years now (since beta 1.6) and won't be going anywhere anytime soon. The current map we are playing on now was fresh with the release of patch 1.5 back in March/May of 2013. [**You can see a couple pictures of our small spawn area here.**](http://imgur.com/a/G4gRo) There aren't any rules for building around spawn, or anywhere on the server for that matter... long as it's not completely obnoxious or impeding on other players of course.

-.

So you’ll probably want to know exactly how we play. We run a strictly 1.5 (1.6 soon, once the bukkit update is out we'll likely be ready on July 6th or 7th) Vanilla Survival Multiplayer server on regular biomes. **No one on the server receives any sort of handouts, and there are no players who are higher ‘ranks’ that other.** No one can pay their way to be an admin/moderator. There are only four admin accounts to moderate the server, and even we play legitimately on a different accounts, as to not abuse the Operator powers. 

Our #1 goal in running this server is to keep it as vanilla as possible, using only necessary plugins for running a successful server. These plugins include WorldEdit/Guard, creeper protection, DeadBolt, logblock, etc. We even disable /home and /spawn commands to ensure this. You set your house on fire? Well, you're going to have to fix it, just as you would in vanilla single-player. Our philosophy is, if you go out hunting, don’t get lost and be prepared to find your way back; it’s an adventure, and the only way to set your spawn point is by using a bed.

An important note to mention about our server is MobGrinders; long ago, they use to run rampant on our serve and caused a diminished amount of mob-spawns in the overworld. We decided to outlaw them completely here on LittleDigPlanet. If you're the kind of person who likes to sit AFK to grind XP and items, this is not the server for you. **This is a hard-mode survival server. Go somewhere else if you don't want to play it like one.**



-. 

**Our definition of 'griefing' and PvP rules** are as follows: Griefing is defined as 'causing grief unto another player' which could mean anything from destroying their build (obviously), stealing from chests, or unjustified killing.

We use to run the server with an free-roam/no rules PvP system, but it just ended up doing nothing but causing nothing but drama. Here on LDP we play to hang out and be friends, not dicks to eachother. It's not really so much fun when everyone gets along except for a single person who wants to just kill everyone. Go to a chaos server for that.

However! If you like to have the persona of some sort of hermit, or what-have-you, I can set your area to be a PvP-Enabled zone. Anyone who enters will get a warning broadcasted to them and will be open for free reign PvP. Anyone who dies in one of these zone is expected not to cry about it.



-.

As far as age is concerned, good rule of thumb is- if you don't act like you're at least 17 or 18, don't bother trying to join. If you're younger than that but **act like your at least 17 or 18**, then cool. It's not like we're going to ban someone who we find out is 15 or 16, it just comes down to how you act. We don’t need any 12 year olds running around being a nuisance.  If someone is always being annoying repeatedly saying things like, “OMG I found DIAMOND!” or, “OMG! A creeper!” or asking, “Who can I build with? Can I build with you? Who wants to be my friend??” they’ll likely not last long with us. We’ve had people like this in the past, and they just get on everyone’s nerves and get booted (but it's also for these requirements that we've built a strong community).

-.

As I mentioned earlier, wiped our server and started a new regular biome world with the release of patch 1.5. Lately we've had usually about 6-10 players on at peak times, so you can assume our server map is still by no means full of giant cities or anything. The beginning area is very new, and it isn't difficult at all to find somewhere to build and get started. 

Some other miscellaneous information I guess I should include is we currently run with 18 slots, 24/7, and hosted by daddycheese.com out of New York. There is a white-list and we play on the **‘hard’** difficulty setting (starvation kills you), and zombies break doors.  We also have a world-border set at 15,000 in every direction from 0,0. It should also be noted that our maps are not permanent. We do server resets every once in a while, usually with every other new patch, or every 6 months. It helps rejuvenate everyone and bring back players. Resets are healthy for a community.That is all I can think of to put here for now, but that’s the rundown of how we play. Now that you've got an understanding of our server and what we are about, (provided you're still interested in joining) send me a private message, or moderator mail on our subreddit and tell us about yourself! There's no set in stone requirement for joining us, but I'd like to hear what **you're** about. I'll probably at least look at your Reddit comment history to make sure you're not a complete idiot as well. 

-.


**TL;DR** (*But you should still read the whole thing!*)


* Strictly Vanilla SMP running version 1.5 (will be patch 1.6 in a few days, likely July 6th or 7th)

* Minimal plugins; only used for protective reasons

* Been around for over 2 years

* 6-10 players online at peak times 

* Server map was reset when Minecraft 1.5 came out.

* [**This is a screenshot of our small spawn village**](http://imgur.com/a/iR4Jq)

* No player ranks; everyone is equal

* On our server, 'griefing' is defined as causing grief unto another player. It's not just destroying peoples work.

* If you die and lose your items, they're gone; no item respawns

* No 'annoying 12 year olds'. Must be at least be 18 years old, or act like it.

* We play on 'Hard Difficulty' (Starvation drains your hearts and kills you; zombies break your doors)

* 18 slot server

* Online 24/7

* Server is hosted by DaddyCheese.com, from New York, USA

* White-list enabled

* No mob grinders. This is a hard-mode server. Go somewhere else if you don't want to play it like one.

* No SMP map is permanent, and neither are ours. We have occasional map resets (as we just had one). Some people get upset with resets, but it's a necessarily evil. It helps rejuvenate the community and bring back old players. We have resets every couple patches, or around every 6 months. 

* Check out our subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/LittleDigPlanet/

* **If you'd like to be white-listed, you can reply here, send me a private message, or use moderator mail on our subreddit. Be sure to tell us about yourself; there's no set in stone requirement for joining the server, just make sure you don't make yourself out to be a complete idiot! The more you tell us about yourself, the better chance you have of being accepted. :)**


Hope to hear from you soon!

* **Description**: Green Bay Minecraft is a tight-knit server, started by a couple guys in their thirties.  Being an old guy/gal isn't a prerequisite to joining this server, mature young players are welcome too.  We run a Mob Arena, PVP Arena, Mall (with user shops) and a School for non-combat skill training.  All players are safe from PvP in or near spawn and PVP is disabled for the first 30 minutes.  Check PVP timer with /pvptimer check and you have the option to remove your own PVP protection early if you choose.  Once you join the server you will spawn in the ""House of Spawn"", everything you need to know is on the roof.  In the basement there is a casino with a few slot machines, Notch who repairs your tools, weaps and armor and of course the server jail.  There is a Nether Portal in the span house and in the basement there is an End portal but it's hidden so you have to be clever or ask a fellow Minecrafter for a hint.  A live world-map can be found on our website, this shows the entire 3,000 x 3,000 world with faction and region territories highlighted.  Creating a faction costs $5,000 and each land claim costs $1,000.  To make money when you're starting out, just do /sell hand command to sell what you are holding.  /bal to check your balance.  All commands are posted on ugbattle.com.

* **Rules**: This is a ‘no warning’ server, if anyone is caught cheating.. or even suspected of cheating they are getting the INSTA-BAN HAMMER. Server policy is when in doubt press BAN. There’s no shortage of responsible players who would be more than happy to take your place. Grieving is allowed so use factions /f claim command to protect your territory. If you die enough and lose enough power you can have this land taken from you so be careful. You start with 20 power, you lose 6 power each time you die and you will gain power at 1 power every 5 minutes up to a 20 power max. Each power enables you to claim a 16x16 area of land bedrock to sky. If you take on multiple faction members, your faction 'max power' increases, factions have a max of 20 members. Random killing is allowed, bullying is not. Random occasional killing of another player to take whatever loot they drop is acceptable but killing the same player over and over is not. When you kill someone you get their head and you can wear it or use it as a decoration in your home or shop, they are quite fun to collect. Repeat killing is only allowed during a raid or in self defense if your victim keeps coming back at you. My advice to all users, just act like you would in RL and ‘hopefully’ you won’t get killed.. much. When a player kills another player, the killer can keep whatever the victim drops, give it back, destroy it or sell it off, this is up to the killer. Absolutely no mods are allowed on this server, this includes mini-map, macros, etc.. If you are caught using any mods you will be insta-banned, no questions asked, no backsies. Texture packs are allowed, Xray is not. Exploiting game or plugin bugs to your advantage is a bannable offense. If you discover a 'bug' and you don't report it, you will probably be banned. Mods can ban anyone at anytime for any reason. All bans are final, if you feel you have been banned unfairly, feel free to vent on our forum.

We are a 100% no nonsense Minecraft server. Mostly vanilla except for anti-grief/cheat and some warps are set up to alleviate the longer walking distances. We are moderated 24/7 with highly manipulable rollbacks installed to ensure there won't be any long-lasting damage caused by griefing. Our moderation team won't hesitate to kick or ban at the slightest sign of bullshit or douchebaggery.

Server Specs:

* 16GB DDR3 RAM
* 3.2 GHz 6 core processor
* 64GB SSD
* 1TB Western Digital HDD

We are hosted at the [Nexcess](http://www.nexcess.net/) data center in Dearborn, Michigan with a 1Gbps connection to the Internet. Our server can handle quite the load, so no need to worry about lag. Theoretically, we can support well over 120 players, but until Minecraft's multi-core support improves our max caps out well before that.

Here at NoBullcraft you start out as a [Drifter] and advance your way up to [Resident]. Residents are more respected, can use lava/TNT, and have the ability to lock chests. The best way to achieve this status is to play on the server, don't be a dick, and most importantly, don't ask to become one! New Residents are selected democratically by current residents, via a voting process held by one of our Mods or Admins.

Our server runs solely on donations, so we ask that if you enjoy playing then you at the very least consider showing us some support. We understand not everyone has the ability to do that, but we greatly appreciate all those that help keep us up and running! Our server will remain public for all to enjoy as long as we are able to pay our monthly fees. In-game, donators will receive a special custom tag of their choice, as well as super awesome protected plots of land...and we sure love donators &lt;3

Any further questions can be asked and answered either in-game, or here on this thread.

We look forward to seeing you online!

* **Server Name:** The Dying of the Light

* **Website:** http://www.dyingofthelight.net/

* **SubReddit**: /r/TheDyingOfTheLight

* **Server IP:** 67.209.228.94

* **Game Play Type:** MC Version 1.6.2. Featuring a new map with many unexplored areas. A post-apocalyptic themed server with unique and custom plugins to reinforce a roleplay-centric and balanced game. No client side mods are required, but it is strongly encouraged to read the [**manual**](http://www.dyingofthelight.net/Manual.html) as we do have many unique and interesting features. 

* **Description:** 

Alright kids, here's the deal. I'm not going to water this description down with flowery soliloquy about how this server will entertain you and your whole family. I'm not going to gussy it up. We've been around nearly 9 months now and have chewed up and spit out a ton of players. 

You see, this server, at it's deep, dark, cold heart was created to weed out the chaff. It's like that asshole coach who made you run laps until you puked because he wanted a winning team this season. It's going to eat you alive if you're not a decent Minecraft player. It's going to crush your soul and make you run back to Creative so you can build your pretty buildings. It's a **hard** server and you are going to hate it. 

The only solace I can offer you is that the map, the gameplay, and the theme is designed to reward tough, intelligent players. It's hard so that the good players shine. We have given you the tools to build defenses. We have given you the tools to build real, impenetrable walls. Farmers matter because guess what? There's barely any dirt to farm on. Ores are prevalent in only a few biomes, but come in spades for those adventurous to find them. Mountain biomes from 0-254y, made of radiation emitting blocks make roads matter. Even the damned sun is out there to burn players without their full leather suit, making any above ground travel something to plan for. In a nutshell, strategy matters for once! 

Use your noggin and you will rule. Play like a spastic griefer and you will die. That's how the game is played. 

There's a ton of info in the [**manual**](http://www.dyingofthelight.net/Manual.html) about our gameplay changes, our environmental effects, our approach to death, and our approach to justice. You will not find a server like this anywhere. We are unique. Listed below are some tidbits to help prime you. 

1. The map is 10,000 x 10,000, custom with an average surface height of 180y, and giant caves. You spawn in the NW area of the map. There are no spawners, no villages, no End portals, no successful Nether portals, no Mineshafts, and custom biomes. There are custom structures that have been spawned into the map. Some have chests with inventory. Most do not. 

2. Sunlight will burn you unless you're wearing a full leather suit. You get a free one on login. The second one will be yours to make. Days are three times as long.

3. You get a free kit on spawn &amp; respawn. It will contain some essentials. Don't waste them.

4. Radiation is almost everywhere, especially the soul sand mountains and the deepest depths. It will kill you if you don't eat Rad-X (unenchanted golden apple) to keep your Rad count down.

5. Rad-X can be crafted using food and water bottles. There are a number of unique crafting recipes.

6. You die. You go to Hell, unless you have life tokens. You get 5 to start. Earn more by roleplaying on the subreddit, escaping Hell, or boring the Gods while in Hell. Craftable life tokens soon to come.

7. We use a chat limiter. Only players within range can hear you.

8. Coordinates won't work. We have radios, maps, and things called ""geographical landmarks"" that will help you navigate.

9. Special mobs with special drops populate the map. Do not underestimate the mobs.

10. There are two special worlds that have replaced the Nether and the End. Hell and a special area where you can do battle to win free lives. It's out there, but you need to find it.

11. Potatoes grow everywhere, but other foods do not.

12. Tesla coils can be built for use against enemies. 

13. Imprisonment/Slavery exists. More hands on than PrisonPearl it will allow you to capture players. Play nice.

And the list goes on. You got the basics. Your best bet? Find some form of civilization. Find some torches. Introduce yourself. It's a hard server, depend on others. 

* **Rules:** Chaos. The few rules that govern play are for cheating and reinforcing a roleplay environment. See the [**rules**](http://www.dyingofthelight.net/rules.html) page on the website for all rules.

* **Server Hardware:** 4 GB RAM, dedicated MC host. 

* **Active Plugins:** AutoSneak, RandomSpawn, RealisticChat, Irradiated, Sunburn, StackableItems, Extrahardmode, CakesRadio, TeslaCoils, and many more custom built plugins...

* **World Generation Plugins:** TerrainControl (with custom structures &amp; ore generation) and GiantCaves (creates giant caves).

* **Owner/Admin:** schneiderwm

* **Moderators:** Solkim (OP support and coding), Warezthebeef (technical help), Borox1, Pernidote, XSerdnaX, and Mister_Mxyzptlk.

Description: This is a strict survival server, set on hard, and creepers do block damage. Very close to vanilla. Only the owner has creative or /give, and he doesn't build. Warm community. Griefing is almost unknown among us; griefers are immediately removed. We have a lot of joint projects, and some gifted builders. If you want to build and have fun, and you're tired of being hassled and having your builds griefed, this is the place for you. This world has been up over a year and there are no plans to take it down, though we do expand it from time to time. We have a live map. http://mc.digstraightdown.com:8123/

Ages 18+ only.

Rules: No griefing, no stealing, no mods that affect gameplay. PVP is off except in our new Arena. Treat everyone with respect.

Server Hardware: commercially hosted. SSD hardware.

Plugins: there are fewer than 20 plugins, including Essentials, logblock, and others. We try to keep plugins to a minimum to minimize lag.

No more are the archers of this world, Legolas reborn, now each arrow has a delay on how fast it can be fired. Legolas fanbois QQ in their boots, while the melee classes rejoice. Fear not archers, with slower speeds comes higher damage. Each arrow at its base has been increased to 3 hearts. Increase this even more if you join Orsana and choose Archery as your weapon skill.


**Vampirism**

A sickness has befallen the world of Greysoul... Those who survive the sickness are forever changed. Cold to the touch, sensitive to light, a lifeless non breathing corpse. The scent of blood awakens them to a mad frenzy, darting and dashing after their foes! Even the monsters of the night are fearful of them, choosing to ignore their presence. The priests of Greysoul may have found a cure but it is not cheap, and those who are turned may not always want the cure. Choose to be a prince of the night, or forever have a wooden weapon on hand!

**!NEW FEATURES!**
---------------
---------------

**mcMMO, Skills and Professions**

A RPG plugin that grants unqiue skills and a leveling experience to players. Chose from one of many Professions and Weaponskills to upgrade and alter the way you fight in PVP Combat! Never before seen abilities to liven up the stale sword and bow spam! This coupled with the faction system grants each enemy different strategies in combat!

* Weapon Skills:
Play as an Orsanian Soldier or Archer! Let your swords wreak havoc while you parry enemy attacks and/or bleed your enemy!

* Choose to be a Raghnall Berserker and rush into battle with a massive battle-axe cleaving your enemies in two with critical hits!
Raghnall has been training hard to combat the soldiers of Orsana and have adapted in ways of the sword as well.

* A new enemy approaches! The Dwarves of Castillona (Cast e- ona), have entered the fray. Dwarven Axe's are just as deadly as the raghnall Berserker, but all fear the dwarven Brawler's fists. He is un-paralleled in unarmed combat causing his foes to drop their weapons mid fight.

* Professions:
Herbs your thing? Come harvest wheat and mushrooms to gain a chance to double proc, the higher your skill the more health is healed by the items you cook! Never again will you look down on the wheat farms of Orsana.

* Digging in the dirt and sand since childhood? Well Excavation may be your thing. Find useful items as you keep that childhood innocence alive, from sulfur and bone to cake and diamonds. Yes you heard right, find diamonds in the rough. (LOL)

* ""I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK. I sleep all night and I work all day"" Cut down the trees faster than ever before and also gain a chance to gain double procs on your wood harvesting buisness...

* Is climbing tress and scaling heights a rush for you? Try your hand at acrobatics and learn the skill of tumbling. Never again worry about the mountains of Raghnall! Leap upon your foes from the cliff tops!

* (Mercator / Castillona only)
Only two of our factions are skilled and or crafty enough to master the delicate work of armor and tool repair! Craft an anvil and get to work! Repairing your tools from a hard day of battle, or do it for the sole purpose of profit! Repairing at higher skill levels will let you proc 'Super Repairs' (hey, I didnt name it), this repairs a MASSIVE ammount of durabilty with only one peice of raw material!

* (Donor Only)
Minecraft is all about the Mining... We all know it and love or hate it. It needs to be done to fuel the warmachine! Iron and Diamonds that are destroyed or lost in battle must be replaced! Purchase them with your rupees or replenish them on your own. Either way the Miner skill will let you mine faster and more fruitful than ever. At Higher levels it will double proc all ores for you... and yes EVEN DIAMONDS!

  **Vampirism**

A sickness has befallen the world of Greysoul... Those who survive the sickness are forever changed. Cold to the touch, sensitive to light, a lifeless non breathing corpse. The scent of blood awakens them to a mad frenzy, darting and dashing after their foes! Even the monsters of the night are fearful of them, chosing to ignore their presence. The priests of Greysoul may have found a cure but it is not cheap, and those who are turned may not always want the cure.

Chose to be a price of the night, or forever have a wooden weapon on hand!



  **Music Craft:**

Play musical compositions using note blocks. [Want to play Gold Saucer from FF7](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFTRelKQxSc&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=32) without using 100 note blocks? Well now you can!



  **New Faction, Castillona!**

A wild Dwarf appears! Fight? Run? ...err wait..... A new Dwarven faction has been spotted in the wild. These stout soldiers of the mountains are a vicious nature and wield Axes or simply punch things to death, master crafters and master blacksmiths are among their many ranks. Join them if a world underground or mining is a passion of yours!

**The Factions:**
---------------
---------------


**Orsana City:** 

We are the civilized people living in under a Single Lordship who seeks to improve our daily life. Under his rule building codes and plot dimensions are strictly enforced, but it is for the better of all. Obey the simple rules of the City and Prosper. Olat the Lord of Orsana has begun expansion into the wilderness clearing forests for roads and settlement expansion. This has so enraged the Raghnall Tribe and these two are now at WAR.

 
  **Raghnall Tribe:** 

Inspired by Fantasy legend and lore of the Nordic / Viking population this tribe of ruthless warriors are a Mountainous people that feel the ever expanding boundaries of Orsana is creeping into their domain. Enraged at the destruction of land and their home they have Declared WAR on the people of Orsana. Doodlord, the leader has two small limitations, no massive structures and you must adhere to the Viking / Nord code. (IE Mainly Wood with small amounts of stone mixed into your buildings.)

  **Castillona:**

A Dwarven race that dwells underground, they specialize in digging in both mountain and dirt/gravel. They are master smiths, and after 100 years of working with tools and armor, they have learned the secrets of repairing broken armor and weapons and tools.

Dwarfs preferably uses axes as fighting weapons, but after many Pub fights they are quite skilled using their bare fists!


  **Mercator (Neutral):** 

The merchant guild is a neutral party that takes it pride in Trading and Architecture skills. They assist in the war effort by supplying each faction with materials. Merchant Coast will be a NO PVP zone. You will trade gold bars or Blocks for Items of your choice. Items that will be supplied, Armor, Weapons, even rare items from the Nether. You can also hire the Architectural Genius's to build structures in your land. If building and creativity is what you want, the Merchant Guild is for you.

* **Description**: You wake up in a random location on the expansive map. No one hears you. You can only speak to people within 100 blocks. You must adventure through the world, looking for other players. But when you find them, don't expect them all to be friendly. You can be killed at any moment. It's up to you, who you trust. Don't leave your stuff out in the open, as thieves may run by and ransack your buildings.

Good luck out there!

* **Description**:
The Sandlot is a moderated, family-friendly server designed to be a safe place for kids and families to play without fear of foul language, hate speech, vulgarity, and the other various scourges of the internet. 

We accomplish this using a whitelist, chat censoring plugins, block logging and anti-grief plugins, as well as visible and present moderator staff.

We also have a solid group of friendly and helpful adult-age players that are parents, friends, relatives, or just friendly strangers that enjoy the company of younger players. We are a 30-slot server, with an average peak-time player count of 16-24 players. Off peak times often have at least a few players on. We have several players from other time zones to help spread the player load around.

Our server strives to maintain the ""vanilla"" experience, straying from it only when necessary to prevent stealing, griefing, etc. We never spawn blocks, and our moderators and administrators play the game just like every other player.

We have been running for over a year now, and recently moved from a VPS to a dedicated server for more stability and room to grow. We offer three worlds to play on: one easy, one normal, and one hard difficulty. We recently started a new map (our normal difficulty map) so there is lots of room for players wanting a fresh start. 

* **Rules**: Our rules are simple and common sense yet clearly stated and are available on our website. No griefing, no cheating, no swearing, etc... We do strictly enforce our rules, and do not make them up as we go along.

* **Server Hardware**: Intel Core i3-2130, 8GB DDR3 RAM, 1TB HDD x2 in RAID 1, 100Mbit connection (OVH-US)

* **Plugins**: Lockette, WorldGuard, GriefPrevention, Player shops (we use gold ingots as currency), Various other Anti-cheat and Anti-grief tools

* **Owner/Admins/Moderators**: Owner: cheracc, Admin: ty564321, Groogaroo Moderators: Rioghan, OisinsVids

* **Pictures/Videos URL**: http://www.sandlotminecraft.com

* **Other**: We aim to be as close to vanilla Minecraft as possible while providing safety from other players that may wish to maliciously interfere with you. Players are able to protect their own land and lock chests and doors. Monsters (creepers, endermen, etc.) do not do block damage.

We are a group of generally mature players. Hence the name, most of us are into smoking weed, sometimes discuss drugs and other adult type topics. You don't have to be a druggy to play, I would say a lot of us are not, but just have an open mind. My goal is to find interesting, engaging and level headed people to play and just hang out. I think everyone on the server plays for mostly the social aspect.


We have been around for a few months now, but a new map is up for 1.3.1 and we will be updating to 1.3.2 in the near future.


We encourage you to play with us, no pressure do donate, and it is almost completely free build. I have high hopes for the future with the server so come help us build the community and have some fun!


*To build on the server, Please register at the [website](http://psychedelicraft.webs.com/) and Submit an [application](http://psychedelicraft.webs.com/apply-to-build)*


**Rules:**

**1)** Please do not ask mods for items, ranks, game modes, or admin rights

**2)** Please do not complain about the server. People that help with this server do it out of their free time. If you have a suggestion just let us know in the forums politely. We always appreciate good ideas!

**3)** Griefing and raiding is not tollorated. We do have anti-griefing pluggins to prevent such a matter but it still should go without saying, stealing and or destroying creations will result in a ban.

**4)** Be respectful and kind. 

**5)** This Server is 18 and over. If you are not 18 then please move along.

**6)** PVP is not permitted unless you both agree before hand. Smacking players you don't know, or who are not expecting it will not be tolerated.



**Server Hardware:**
We run a remotely hosted server, rented from beastnode.com. Currently we do not experience any lag, and we have 30 player slots open.


Server runs on 1 gig of dedicated ram, which has been working just great, but if the future requires upgrades we will make them


Backups run frequently and remote backups are ran daily

Through the use of a plugin called Factions, players can group up to form city-states and compete for dominance over a vast world and multiverse.  A Faction can be destroyed if their leader's power is dropped to the minimum (*-20*) at your hands!  Once the leader is out of power, the faction is disbanded and all territory controlled, is removed.  You lose 4 power on each death and power will regenerate over time.

Factions gain power for each player added. The amount of power added to the faction decreases the more players the faction has.  A faction can be sieged with TNT cannons, or Gold Cannons only when it's members are online, the explosion protection turns on after the last member is offline for at least 15 minutes.

Factions can form strategic alliances with one and another. Leaders are able to customize how other factions, and members of their own faction interact with their territory for ultimate control.

There are many plugins installed on the server to offer a varied style of gameplay. Some of the noteable plguins include:

* Jobs -Players can join a job to earn money by mining, farming and crafting.
* ChestShop -Factions can create shops at spawn to trade valuable materials.
* HeroBounty -Place bounties on other players, or hunt targets for cubecoins.
* TopPVP -Keeps track of the number deaths and kills each player has.
* Cannons -Create cannons out of Gold Blocks that launch several different kinds of projectiles.
* LavaFurnace -Power furnaces with lava and utilize production chests for advanced smelting.

Walt Disney World - Magic Kingdom Preview

We are proud to present Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom in Florida.

Although a few items remain to be filled in, all the rides are now finished and ridable, plus restaurants are working.

This project started on the Reddit Creative Server and was later moved to Redstonehost.com. It took us 4 months of work and over 25 Cast Members to finish. We have recently started on EPCOT and will be continuing the resorts soon. As each park is finished we will release another download. As always, these downloads are free. We seek no monetary gain.

SGTekkit is the ultimate Minecraft Tekkit experience. What is Tekkit? Tekkit is a collection of SMP mods that really enhance the game and adds so many new items that the avid player will still be interested for a long, long time to come. 

Boredom is never an issue when playing with the Tekkit Mods. There are specialty machines to supply power to other machines. Utilize Lava / Oil and or the Sun to harness energy and fuels. Create automated farms that replant by themselves. Have automatic crafting tables to manufacture a never ending supply of Diamond Tools with advanced machinery. 

Everyone’s Tekkit experience is individual! Come and decide how yours will be!

**Installing Tekkit is incredibly simple! It runs in its own separate Minecraft client!** You can find a full guide on how to connect to SGTekkit on our website or by [clicking here](http://www.sgtekkit.net/join)

We do require you to apply for citizenship to build. This is a counter-measure for griefing, of course. Although you can log in as a visitor and  check out the server. Application approval usually takes no longer than an hour.

Additional Plugins:
*Towny
*iConomy
*Chest Shops
*Hawk Eye
*LWC (Light Weight Chest – Protection)
*Money Drop

As the title implies, we are virtually a lag free server. This is because my custom scripts load minecraft into a ramdisk (tempfs). This means that the entire game is running in memory instead of from the hard drive.

In addition to anti-lag, we feature a number of extremely popular plugins. Runecraft v2 and iConomy/iCShop change the dynamics of the game and make it even more fun. And the LWC plugin allows users to lock their chests to prevent stealing.

We did a map wipe on Saturday, January 29, 2011. Our new map features all of the latest and greatest blocks and items.

THE SERVER -24/7 Server

-Player limit: 26

-Player ranks based on trustworthiness (Peon, Default, Altarboy, Priest, Elder, Saint, Templar, Holy Spirit, God) NOT A RELIGIOUS SERVER.

-Kits (Deluxe sets for Priests)

-Monsters are turned OFF until health is server-side. No point in wasting CPU cycles on something that doesn't work. (you can still see them in dungeons though)

-There is a 160 unit protection radius on the spawn zone. Nobody but Templars/Admins can build here.

RULES:

-Obviously, no griefing. This will result in being permanently banned.

-Build your buildings at a decent distance from other buildings, no building-crowding. Failure to do this will result in having your building torn down by a mod or admin.

-TNT is for use by Priests and above only. If you need something blown up ask someone.

-Asking for priesthood or modship automatically disqualifies you for it.

-Back-sass to mods is allowed, so long as it's justified.

-No water or lava structures.

IF YOU NEED FIRE ASK A MOD, otherwise we will think you are burning down someones baby.

See you there!

* **Description**: 

Welcome to the Blocktopia server cluster, now accessible through one convenient address.  Blocktopia is one of the oldest minecraft communities, and was founded back in the alpha days pre-SMP.  Initially Blocktopia focused on the development of a first batch of classic servers, introducing lava survival, zombie survival, and TNT combat.  Each one of these servers has enjoyed long-term success, but as the classic minecraft community continues to lose support and interest the Blocktopia devs have been hard at work recreating each of these servers for premium Minecraft. The result has been the development of four unique minecraft servers:  

* **Rituals of Fire [Lava Survival PvE]** 

* **Army of Darkness [Infection PvP]**

* **TNT Wars [TNT PvP]**

* **BuildBox [Creative]** 

* **Journey to Elysium [SMP]**

Each one of these servers may be accessed through the central hub at **lobby.blocktopia.net**

This lobby is a new development, and we anticipate adding activities for the community while you wait on friends.

Once you connect to the lobby, you will see five portals. Each portal will connect you to a separate server.

**If you wish to return to the lobby and select another game type, use the /logout command.**  Or simply disconnect and reconnect.


Descriptions of the individual servers are as follows:

* **Rituals of Fire [PvE]**

Rituals of Fire is an upgraded lava survival experience.  Here players must cooperate and work together to escape and survive the rising lava tides.  The server contains a collection of survival maps and a main lobby.  Players have the option of sitting rounds out and working on their gear in the main lobby, and may join the game in progress through the central portal at any time.  While in the map, players are given a few minutes to collect needed resources and begin to build their forts.  Lava then begins to release gradually throughout the map, and the server will broadcast when the next wave begins.  Each map has its own twists and turns.

Players who survive the lava are rewarded with cookies, which allow for the purchase of new ranks and items.  Higher ranks allow for faster cookie accumulation, as well as access to enderchests, enchantments, and special crafting rooms.

In between rounds players are encouraged to duke it out on King of the Ladder.  Whoever sits atop the ladder the longest is awarded various goodies.  If you die you retain your items so don't stress out.

Some impressions here [http://imgur.com/a/RETsV](http://imgur.com/a/RETsV)


* **TNT Wars [PvP]**

Our newest server addition and the fastest paced. TNT Wars is a reincarnation of a classic counterpart of the same name, and aims to provide a heavily-modded twist to Minecraft PVP. The basic goal of the server is true to its name; use the TNT block we all know to blow stuff up and hopefully get your enemies too while you're at it. To help you, there are many other custom coded weapons (such as Grenades, lightning attacks, ""Axetinguisher""s and more) that are all special and help you gain an advantage over your opponent.

On TNT, the games are played in 10 minute rounds, on a randomly selected map (out of 40+) and each round can be one of many game modes. To give you a taste of what game modes are on offer we have:
Capture the flag. This is the classic game we all know. Try and sneak into the teams base and bring their flag back to yours. Watch out though. When you're holding the flag, you've lost your ability to sprint!
Control Point. Stay in the control point for as long as possible and rack up points for your team. It's quite small though, so you're gonna have to be very devious to dodge the incoming TNT.
Words can only say so much... Check out the trailer for all the information!

 [TRAILER](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=EU-aGnKq6xM)

* **Army of Darkness [PvP]**

Army of Darkness is the replacement for the classic Zombie and TNT wars servers.  The gameplay is infection PvP with a minecraft twist.  Maps are randomly selected from a pool of about 40, and Survivors are given a few minutes to explore the map, gather resources, and hunt down items located in chests throughout the map.  After time is up, the survivors are no longer able to gather resources and a Dark Hunter is randomly selected.  Survivors who die are transformed into hunters, and the round continues until either all of the survivors perish or the round time expires (6-10 minutes).

Each map is designed to focus on a different gameplay aspect, from parkour to TNT to archery.  The map authors create pre-built kits that are assigned upon player spawn that fit the theme and help assist new players.  Gear is reset completely between rounds to ensure that the playing field remains level - no donators in full enchanted diamond running around here!  Anyone is welcome to jump in and play.

Renders of a few of the AoD maps may be seen here: [http://imgur.com/a/4vW2a](http://imgur.com/a/4vW2a)

* **BuildBox [Creative]**

Both of the two previous servers feature multiple maps created within the community.  To encourage new map makers and provide a creative outlet for the community the BuildBox is available for any would-be mapmaker or anyone who simply wants to build something amazing.  Here players are allowed to create their own plots in which they are allowed access to WorldEdit commands (and VoxelSniper for the trusted players).  

Anything built here may be exported as a schematic and downloaded at the community site, so your builds may endure forever.  They may also be exported for use on the RoF and AoD servers if they are approved by volunteer staff members who will review your submissions and recommend changes if necessary.

The livemap may be seen here: [http://smp.blocktopia.net/buildbox/#](http://smp.blocktopia.net/buildbox/#)

* **Journey to Elysium [SMP]** 

This final server is also the newest and most popular, and offers players the chance to build their own communities and towns.  Journey to Elysium is a SMP-focused server with several existing towns, NPCs, a booming emerald economy, and PvP + PvE regions.  This allows players to focus on building their worlds without fear of griefers thanks to various plugins, or cross the great ice wall into the PvP regions and duke it out.  Established villages and towns are marked on the livemap.

Supernatural players - To add some flavor to combat and give players some special abilities. Because who doesn't love those?

Would Anyone be Interested in a Creative Server Dedicated to the Building of the Land of Ooo from Adventure Time? (X-Post from r/minecraft)",18,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/il7qc/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_creative_server/,"[Here is the original thread. Most discussion and updates are happening here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/il2b7/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_creative_server/)

~~**UPDATE:** We have a guy that can host. He says he can't make it dedicated, but he's on ""most of the day"" (therefore the server is up a lot) and this would be a good opportunity to start the map for another server when we want to upgrade. Problem is he can only host about 12 people and anyone who wants to join must have Hamachi. Anyone interested?~~

**UPDATE 2:** There's a Redditor here that may be able to set up a dedicated server for us, no Hamachi, ~20 people at once, so keep your fingers crossed. I encourage you guys to go to the crappy [forums](http://atmc.lefora.com/) I set up and get started there. The forums will just be for collaborating, sharing ideas, announcements, etc. They aren't necessary, but sign up if you want as it will make things easier. Keep hoping my man can get this server up!

**UPDATE 3: We are live! Come join us at landofooo.dyndns-server.com:25567 and the forums at atmc.jadons.com!**

I was visiting Minecraft Middle-Earth and it got me thinking. Wouldn't it be sweet if we could recreate the Land of Ooo from Adventure Time in Minecraft? Who would be interested in such an idea? There's a lot of potential, considering the Ooo is huge and full of sprawling towns and biomes and colorful locations. Here are some ideas.

* The center of the map, or the spawn area, could be the [Candy Kingdom.](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/Candy_Kingdom) Players could create permanent homes in this area.
* Finn and Jake's [Tree Fort](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/Candy_Kingdom) could be a fun thing to build. There are landmarks around the area there that would be fun to create too.
* [Marceline's House](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/Marceline%27s_House) could be build in a huge cave.
* [Lumpy Space](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/Lumpy_Space) could be created in the Nether, as long as an appropriate texture pack made the Nether look ""right."" Or we could build it in the clouds.
* The [Ice Kingdom](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/Ice_Kingdom) would be great to build in a snow biome, obviously.
* Then there's the [City of Theives](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/City_of_Thieves_%28location%29), [Cube Village](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/Cube_Village), [Desert of Doom](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/Desert_of_Doom), [Boom Boom Mountain](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/Boom_Boom_Mountain), and [all these other places.](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Places)

New locations are constantly being added, and there are tons of minor locations from specific episodes. I don't have the hardware to create a server, but I'd love to be involved in such a project. Any other Adventure Time fans out there?

tl;dr I'm looking for a free, new Minecraft server host to let me and a community of builders create Ooo, the mystical land from the show Adventure Time with Finn &amp; Jake. Please check out the link at the top of the page, where people are responding the most. If you want to help find or host (or host yourself!) please respond or PM me.

EDIT: Another idea hit me. If this did get rolling, we could always have a talented person create us an official Adventure Time texture pack that matched that of the show (the current ones out as of now don't really capture the show that well, imo). And someone could make us character skins as well. I know there's talented Redditors out there that'd love to be involved.

EDIT 2: Further ideas submitted so far. Will be updating as comments come.

* Using the Skylands mod for Lumpy Space. Great idea. Waiting for the sky dimension idea being developed by Notch to be officially released might be more rewarding, however.
* The maze from [The Limit](http://adventuretimewithfinnandjake.wikia.com/wiki/The_Limit)
* Tree Trunks' and Lady Rainicorn's house
* Land of the Dead or the Nightosphere could be in the Nether

EDIT 3: [Here](http://imgur.com/9Sz4T) is a *very* rough approximation of what the tree fort could look like. Now that it's possible to place leaf blocks, this could be incredibly easy.

EDIT 4: **IMPORTANT!** I made a request on the Minecraft forums for someone to host for us. Hopefully someone will respond. [Here it is.](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/456611-looking-for-host/)

EDIT 4a: I've asked around on the Minecraft forums. It seems there are some people who wouldn't mind us building Ooo on their server, but I've yet to find a host that will dedicate the entire server to such a project. I'm still looking.

EDIT 4b: I'm still looking for a free host that'd be dedicated. No real luck so far.

EDIT 5: I hate to be a douche, but can anyone who upvotes this thread also upvote [this x-post?](http://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/il2lw/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_creative_server/) I want people in r/adventuretime to see what we're up to.

**Overview:**

Greysoul is a community of active Minecrafters who have ascended into a world of battle and intrigue. The player base frequently participates in daily raids, battles, and ambushes in the brutal exchange of power and land. Here you will find your countrymen among a number of Nations; including a highly-structured Kingdom, chaotic brotherhood of Viking warriors, and shrewd Merchants. With the recent update to the Towny plug-in, it is now a better time than ever to join in this world as the Empires begin to expand outward from their home territories to uncontested lands. How will you forge your legend in this world of power and devastation? Come fight for glory, or build your name atop a mountain of gold. Earn your titles as you slay the enemy, strike down on the Tyrannical King and his legions, if you dare; or drive back the Viking hordes and wild beasts of lore untold. Whatever side you choose, the battles will be fierce and the fun will be everlasting.

**Server Perk:**

Every server you have been a part of has died off, plugins are out of date, and/or your cool ideas falls upon deaf ears? No more! The Greysoul Admin and Moderators are in constant communication with the plugin developers, giving feedback, getting adjustments, and/or developing ENTIRELY new plugins. The 'Arrow-Limiter' plugin was developed as a Greysoul exclusive plugin, then later released to improve other servers. The well known plugin, mcMMO, which was developed by Nossr50, is one of the MAIN plugins on many RPG servers. Nossr50 and Server Admin, are in constant communication on how to better mcMMO. What this means to you is our server is the breeding ground for new idea's and improvements of one of the best RPG - Leveling plugins, your ideas, critique's and opinions are taken into account and put to good use. 

New plugins developed just for Greysoul are paid for by player donations to make this server better, for you the player. This will continue to be the way as the plugin developers listen to our feedback and tweak them to make our PVP experience one of balance and fun. As long as we have donations, you will have a server that is constantly changing for the better.

* Tamer (New Class!)
* Priest (New Class!)

Check out [this Imgur link](http://imgur.com/uf0mD?full) for a quick description of the Classes.

**New Classes!**

**Priest:** Love that feeling that YOU are the reason your teammates survived an ambush? That YOU and your buff on the swordsman are what caused a gank to go so well? Then look no further! The Priest could very well be the perfect class for you! Use your holy book to Heal, Buff, and Resurrect your teammates! 

**Mage:** 'A 7 inch wicker wand is all I need to make my maidens love me' With the mage class, unleash amazing area of effect spells, entomb your enemies within glass, and blink away from the brunt of the damage! With lots of new spells being added constantly, this is becoming a very popular class! Get it while you can Harry!

**Tamer:** Harness the power of nature itself, by taming and leveling up your very own Wolf! You can name this beast, if you so wish, and develop stronger bonds than glue itself. Fido will follow you into battle and loyally strike down any who have the audacity to oppose you. Unlike normal wolves, Fido will respawn after dying, with a short cooldown of course. Never feel lonely again, yet you are alone, so very, very alone...

##!NEW PLUGINS!##
***

**Arrow Limiter**

No more are the archers of this world, Legolas reborn, now each arrow has a delay on how fast it can be fired. Legolas fanbois QQ in their boots, while the melee classes rejoice. Fear not archers, with slower speed comes higher damage. Each arrow at its base has been increased to 3 hearts. Increase this even more if you join Orsana and choose Archery as  your weapon skill.

**HookShot** (Donors Only)

See a need, fill a need.. See a wall climb a wall? No more worrying about building pillars to climb walls or get out of caves. Our VIP's enjoy the newest technology including this amazing hookshot. Aim an Arrow, right click, then select string and right click, you will be yanked to the arrow. Use it to scale walls, Escape or chase down people in PVP. Go spelunking, shoot and zip anywhere your heart desires!

**Runecraft**

The Legendary SSP plugin ported over into SMP. Craft runes on the ground using Redstone, ore blocks and other materials, right click to activate, and voila. Useful and fun runes for the entire server to use. Examples being: Zeerix Chest, summon a chest to your location grab some items and then return that chest back to its orginal spot. Another? Well sure, Phantom Torch, a few simple redstone and a few torchs, creates a magic floating torch that follows you where ever you go, the duration is dependent on the Key Tier rune you use upon creation. These are just 2 examples of the many different runes you can cast!

**ItemCraft**

Itemcraft is a SMP port for SSP plugins. This AMAZING plugin allows SSP plugins like but not limited to, KSlopes, FancyPack, and Mo'Creatures to be ported over into SMP. Yes, thats right, I said Mo'Creatures on a SMP server. Before we get ahead of our selves I will explain the other 2 we have on our server.

* kSlopes: Allows for slanted blocks, angled blocks, and other amazing corner blocks to be placed, giving your creations a totally unique, and unblocky feel to them.

* FancyPack: FancyPack adds many new items and designs to the game. Chairs, tables, chains, decorations, hidden wall panels, and much more!

* Mo'Creatures: One of the most famous SSP plugins that spawns lions and tigers and bears, oh my! and various other woodland creatures, including tameable, rideable, and breedable horses (Horses are currently buggy in SMP)

**For a complete list and detailed descriptions of each plugin, check the website**

We have all but one problem, there is not enough dedicated people to fill our server. We have some amazing, very active community members but are always looking for more. Our server has currently 16 slots and is looking to fill a majority of them. We are almost pure vannilla. All we have are simple bukkit mods that allow for things such a prevention of griefing and the ability to lock chests. If this sounds like the place for you please leave a comment and I would be happy to add you to the whitelist.

This server is a dedicated one so the costs are paid for by are Youtube channel. We would appreciate it if you check us out. =)

* **Description**: 

Toro League is a Minecraft roleplay server for a fictional setting in the Pokéverse. The Toro Region, is a new under-developed continent where trainers (that's you) come from around the world to start a new adventure. You will have the chance to act, talk and play as your own fictional character to wander the Toro region or settle down in the city... or start a business... or be a prospector... or a nurse... or a gym leader... the possibilities are endless!

We're a growing community that currently has over 200 registered members on our forums with an average of 15 players online during a weekday. There is a white-list application but that is primarily to ensure that the community understands the bare minimal for roleplay. The current server can easily handle up to 50 players with pokémon flying enabled and we're currently in the process of updating our server to 1.6.2.  

I also personally make the server's texture pack myself to ensure the best RP immersion possible. It will automatically prompt you when you login to download the texturepack. 

Join us today for a fun easy time that doesn't involve killing each other!

A curious side-effect this rule is that while griefing is allowed, hardly anybody does it. Racism, sexism, cursing, it is all allowed. Don't worry, there's also a /mute command.

BAD has been continually hosted for over 16 months of fierce dick on dick action.

**Info:**


When I join most locked servers, I know what I'm in for. I know that my items are completely secured, and everything that I make is going to, for the most part, last forever. 

In contrast, Vanilla is not that. Vanilla is not necessarily safe.

In Vanilla, my sense of security comes from me, and the decisions that I make. 

In Vanilla, the only reason that I suspect I might be safe in my own home is **because** I decided to get lost in the world.

To add to that, I'm not even sure if CreeperHugger42 (who just joined the server) is going to be a friend or a foe. But guess what...the outcome of his (and every other players') allegiance to me is based on how I interact with them. Will I bring him food when his life balances on the edge of starvation? How about a room and bed to sleep in when the night decides to crawl out? It's these kinds of decisions that determine one's place in the server, not just rules that have been written or hard coded into the game.

Now, that's not to say that there's no room to be civil. Civilizations can grow and prosper in even the most hostile of environments. But for that, survival requires teamwork.

Mushroom runs on Pure Vanilla, straight from Mojang. But besides us, Pure Vanilla servers are few and far between these days. However, there's a good reason for that: most servers *need* to add plugins to simplify basic admin tasks. Things like QoS (Quality of Service) and server security are made really easy with the introduction of Bukkit and Plugins.

Yet, I still consider myself a big proponent of Pure Vanilla. There's just something about Minecraft in it's simplest form that is so beautiful. The uncertainty, the raw thrill associated with not knowing what could happen at any moment is addicting. And being able to influence the world with more than my blocks is just that much more alluring.

**Other**: This write-up
should adequately describe what we're all about. Hopefully it'll give
you a great idea of how we play, and anything else you might wonder
about us and if we're really the server for you. I suggest reading everything
to ensure this is the place you want to play, but skip to the TL;DR if
you'd rather read that.



-.

Anywho, I’ll give you a little backstory of our server. June of 2011
we began as a group of Real Life friends just looking to play together
online. We’ve been around for over two years now (since beta 1.6) and
won't be going anywhere anytime soon. The current map we are playing
on now was fresh with the release of patch 1.5 back in March/May of
2013. [**You can see a couple pictures of our small spawn area
here.**](http://imgur.com/a/G4gRo) There aren't any rules for building
around spawn, or anywhere on the server for that matter... long as
it's not completely obnoxious or impeding on other players of course.

-.

So you’ll probably want to know exactly how we play. We run a strictly
1.6 Vanilla Survival Multiplayer server on regular
biomes. **No one on the server receives any sort of handouts, and
there are no players who are higher ‘ranks’ than others.** No one can
pay their way to be an admin/moderator. There are only four admin
accounts to moderate the server, and even we play legitimately on a
different accounts, as to not abuse the Operator powers.

Our #1 goal in running this server is to keep it as vanilla as
possible, using only necessary plugins for running a successful
server. These plugins include WorldEdit/Guard, creeper protection,
DeadBolt, logblock, etc. We even disable /home and /spawn commands to
ensure this. You set your house on fire? Well, you're going to have to
fix it, just as you would in vanilla single-player. Our philosophy is,
if you go out hunting, don’t get lost and be prepared to find your way
back; it’s an adventure, and the only way to set your spawn point is
by using a bed.

An important note to mention about our server is MobGrinders; long
ago, they use to run rampant on our serve and caused a diminished
amount of mob-spawns in the overworld. We decided to outlaw them
completely here on LittleDigPlanet. If you're the kind of person who
likes to sit AFK to grind XP and items, this is not the server for
you. **This is a hard-mode survival server. Go somewhere else if you
don't want to play it this way.**



-.

**Our definition of 'griefing' and PvP rules** are as follows:
Griefing is defined as 'causing grief unto another player' which could
mean anything from destroying their build (obviously), stealing from
chests, or unjustified killing.

We used to run the server with a free-roam/no rules PvP system, but it ended up causing nothing but drama. Here on LDP
we play to hang out and be friends, not dicks, to each other. It's not a lot of fun when everyone gets along except for a single person
who just wants to kill everyone. Go to a chaos server for that.

However! If you like to act as some sort of hermit, or
what-have-you, I can set your area to be a PvP-Enabled zone. Anyone
who enters will get a warning broadcasted to them and will be open for
free reign PvP. Anyone who dies in one of these zone is expected not to cry about it.



-.

As far as age is concerned, good rule of thumb is- if you don't act
like you're at least 17 or 18, don't bother trying to join. If you're
younger than that but **act like your at least 17 or 18**, then cool.
It's not like we're going to ban someone we find out is 15 or 16,
it just comes down to how you act. We don’t need any 12 year olds
running around being nuisances.  If someone is always being annoying
repeatedly saying things like, “OMG I found DIAMOND!” or, “OMG! A
creeper!” or asking, “Who can I build with? Can I build with you? Who
wants to be my friend??” they’ll likely not last long with us. We’ve
had people like this in the past, and they just get on everyone’s
nerves and get booted (but it's also for these requirements that we've
built a strong community).

-.

As I mentioned earlier, we wiped our server and started a new regular
biome world with the release of patch 1.5. Lately we've had about 6-10 players on at peak times, so you can assume our server map
is still by no means full of giant cities or anything. The beginning
area is very new, and it isn't difficult to find somewhere to
build and get started.

Some other miscellaneous information I guess I should include is we
currently run with 18 slots and are hosted by daddycheese.com out
of New York. There is a white-list and we play on the **‘hard’**
difficulty setting (starvation kills you), and zombies break doors.
We also have a world-border set at 15,000 in every direction from 0,0.
It should also be noted that our maps are not permanent. We do server
resets every once in a while, usually with every other new patch, or
every 6 months. It helps rejuvenate everyone and bring back old players.
Resets are healthy for a community.That is all I can think of to put
here for now, but that’s the rundown of how we play. Now that you've
got an understanding of our server and what we are about, (provided
you're still interested in joining) send me a private message, or
moderator mail on our subreddit and tell us about yourself! There's no requirement set in stone for joining us, but I'd like to hear what
**you're** about. I'll probably at least look at your Reddit comment
history to make sure you're not a complete idiot as well.

-.


**TL;DR** (*But you should still read the whole thing!*)


* Strictly Vanilla SMP running version 1.6 

* Minimal plugins; only used for protective reasons

* Been around for over 2 years

* 6-10 players online at peak times

* Server map was reset when Minecraft 1.5 came out.

* [**This is a screenshot of our small spawn
village**](http://imgur.com/a/iR4Jq)

* No player ranks; everyone is equal

* On our server, 'griefing' is defined as causing grief unto another
player. It's not just destroying peoples work.

* If you die and lose your items, they're gone; no item respawns

* No 'annoying 12 year olds'. Must be at least be 18 years old, or act like it.

* We play on 'Hard Difficulty' (Starvation drains your hearts and
kills you; zombies break your doors)

* 18 slot server

* Server is hosted by DaddyCheese.com, from New York, USA

* White-list enabled

* No mob grinders. This is a hard-mode server. Go somewhere else if
you don't want to play it this way.

* No SMP map is permanent, and neither are ours. We have occasional
map resets (as we just had one). Some people get upset with resets,
but it's a necessarily evil. It helps rejuvenate the community and
bring back old players. We have resets every couple patches, or around
every 6 months.

* Check out our subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/LittleDigPlanet/

* **If you'd like to be white-listed, you can reply here, send me a
private message, or use moderator mail on our subreddit. Be sure to
tell us about yourself; there's no set in stone requirement for
joining the server, just make sure you don't make yourself out to be a
complete idiot! The more you tell us about yourself, the better chance
you have of being accepted. :)**


Hope to hear from you soon!

 Here at Minecraft Junkie we just love Minecraft and playing it, so our server is about feeding that addiction and just having fun playing this amazing game. We feel everyone should be able to play, so our server is 100% public right away, you may build right off the bat and we have no builder rank.

 Also, for our server to be public and grief free, we have a team of staff devoted to preventing griefing at all costs, so everyone can play the game and not worry about their builds and items. Also our staff are promoted to playing just like you, they do not spawn items and we keep the true vanilla feel.

 We are very centered around the idea of a community. We have many towns, cities, businesses, and whole civilizations of people working together to survive in the world of Minecraft. Each community can do whatever they please. They can institute their own economy system, make their own community storage, create farms, have leaders, make jobs, literally anything. This is what makes Minecraft Junkie so great, our communities and the people on the server are always just there to have fun and play Minecraft.

A few things that are A MUST!

 * Fairly populated
*     Serious role play (meaning no one in chat talking out of character unless marked as such, even this should be limited)
*     Free role play; the world and lore is built by the players, and not predetermined events
*     A few plugins that help aid the experience (things like mcmmo, chat plugins, factions, etc)
*     Different races (dwarves, elves, humans, etc)
*     Deep lore that's interesting to learn (ie no ""Steve was the leader and died"" better would be a long engaging story talking about his reign, his life, his enemies, and how he died)
*     WHITELIST, enforced by requiring some type of backstory (or the like)
*     Friendly staff, that will actually RP
* No prison/drug servers

Our gaming and development community called [Precipice Games](http://www.precipicegames.com) is legally registered as a non-profit organization in California and 100% funded by our active members. We mostly congregate on our Minecraft Creative server and our Mumble voice chat server, though most of us also play other games together.
On the server, we mainly gather together to build crazy things, show off our individual projects or learn something new about the game and its development everyday. As well, every weekend or so, we have an Events server which we use to host various adventure maps or PvP arena type games (for example, we've had our version of the Hunger Games in Minecraft and we also have a Race for the Wool League planned for the future) for the community to enjoy. We also have a whitelisted survival server for members of a certain rank.


The server itself has many features, but most of all, we pride ourselves in our fair organization, and a group of fantastic, tight-knit and mature members. Our staff of around a dozen active moderators, devs and admins are experienced (majority of which having moderated for over a year and all been playing since Alpha or early Beta), just, and, take this as you will, all at least over the age of 20. Our ingame chat system is hooked to an IRC server which connects our Creative and Survival server togehter and we have other cool little plugins that make the place unique.


The server has no whitelist, however, we use a ranking system to curb griefing and encourage good behaviour. Advancing through the ranks will unlock new building tools for players (and eventually Creative mode) and is solely based on merit such as building skills and friendly attitude, as such not everyone will get a rank up; donating money to us, though very welcome and encouraged, is not a necessity in advancing through the ranks and unlocking new tools (you are instead given different cosmetic perks ingame for recognition). If you wish to build on the server and join our community, I invite you to read all the signs ingame and consult our forums for more detailed information. Be warned, we don't accept all new players, though if you are an even remotely good, mature, patient and understanding builder, you should have no problems getting your first rank up.


Make sure you understand the rules! The basic ones are: use common sense, be nice, don't swear, and don't use any client modifications not specifically approved in our forums. Ingame, type ""/help"", ""/faq"", and read the signs in spawn to get you started! A forewarning though: we don't take kindly to immature and asinine behaviour. Please don't act like a typical conceitedly entitled 14 year old.

My simple hardcore server has limited plugins to keep the Vanilla feel alive! Our only plugins are anti-xray, WorldBorder, starting items, and a random spawner.
 
Start off in a random location with just a few items to start. Build a home and raid other homes, or fend off invaders. If you see someone, choose to be their friend or foe. Be careful: If you die, then you're done for six hours!
 
The person to have the most kills at the end of the week (6/22) will receive a golden name! Each consecutive week will have different rewards.
 
We ask that all players act maturely and do not hack or xray. Failure to follow these simple rules will result in a ban. Griefing and looting is allowed, and TNT actually works!

Open to everyone.",18,8,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/uuxy0/legends_wildlands_epic_customgenerated_world/,"**Server**: firefly.techhell.net

We want to provide an engaging, dynamically-changing RPG experience, and we think we've created the perfect world for it to take place. Anyone can join; this is the Feral chapter, so it's wide-open to be explored and contested.

Classes receive skills with each level. It's not about the grind, it's about the progression. Each level unlocks another extremely useful (or deadly) skill, and each skill makes you more explosive or more elusive, depending on your path and the secrets you discover.

* Immense, unforgettable landscapes spanning all heights and depths.
* Epic forests and wastelands, towering mountains, impassable jungles.
* Eight unique classes innately benefited by their native biomes.
* Movement and acrobatic skills to aid in exploration.
* Customized Legends interface, powered by the Heroes engine.
* 40+ plugins used to expand and intensify the usual Minecraft experience.
* New, vastly more interesting and in-depth clan system.
* Unique region protection through our own version of the PreciousStones system.
* Classes have been further refined and new traits and skills added.
* Intense, loot-filled dungeon instances to plunder and explore.
* New features planned and implemented regularly.

Cheaters and trouble-makers are quickly sorted, we're looking to share what we've created and we think you'll appreciate the direction it's headed.

If you're fed up with the poor grammar, obnoxious players, and general immaturity of some of the servers out there, we may be what you're looking for!

We run ~50 plugins, on Bukkit, hosted on a dedicated 6-core rig with 16GB ram. Files are stored on a SSD, and backups are run hourly. Uptime approaching 99%! 

**How we run:**

Griefing is not tolerated in any form. Poor grammar &amp; spelling, jerks, spam, and bad attitudes are dealt with quickly, or at least hilariously. Our server is organized, has creative and survival worlds, and is semi-gray listed. No cussing in public chat (though most language will fly in private), and an absolute no harassment rule. We have a dedicated staff, and active, helpful players to answer any questions you have. This weekend, we'll try to have as much staff on as possible, to help awesome redditors get settled. When you get on the server, you'll spawn in our ""noob"" world. Play well here, and you'll get promoted to recruit, a much more open rank. Staff may observe your progress, but help us get to know you too! We like meeting friendly new players, and the vast majority of us are redditors. That said, most memes are beaten to death by the time they hit the front page, so we don't really like them used on the server. Wow, that was a lot! Pm an admin the world ""narwal"" and receive a diamond for reading all of this :) 

Anyway, if you've got a clean ban record, a good attitude, and you're looking for a great community to be a part of, come check us out! 


**IP: play.scribbleserver.com**

_
&gt;**Be aware**, if you have a past history of bans, fail to follow our simple rules, or are a jerk in any way, we may put you into our maze (or worse). It's our right to chose players, and we have very high standards. This keeps our community as friendly and happy as possible.

They also let you submit servers for them to grief, and are capable of **session stealing** allowing them to hijack your minecraft account. Two of my friends from my server have had their accounts hijacked, both of which had their password changed and had to reset them. My account was switched to a mojang account instead of a minecraft account, so maybe that's why mine isn't hijacked.

Notice that this is not the complete plugin list, and that some of these plugins are for building, and behind the scenes.

I *just* started with this, so if anything doesn't really make sence, or something should be corrected, it's because i haven't thought this a 100% through yet :)

The idea of the server is to have some serious roleplaying going on. Permissions, classes, factions(i know there aren't really any faction plugins on the list yet), countries, lords, kings and stuff like that shall be used a lot. 
If somebody wants to be a mage, he'll be able to cast spells, make firework and transform into.. lets say, the ender dragon. A player who wants to be a warrior will not have these abilities, yet he will be able to use weapons and armor more effectively. A scout/spie or ranger might be able to transform into whatever the *passive* mod they'd like. A werewolf could transform into a wolf. 

I have an idea about how the storyline is going to work, but it will have to be a forever WIP, since i want the game to keep running. There will be a storyline, in shape of *""At some point, dwarfes are going to attack humans, but we don't know when. Maybe when we get enough troops. It should be done by the end of this week though""*. Kinda like in real life - you can't really plan anything.

If any of you have feedback on this, please leave it in the comments. If you want to participate, please PM me - you will have to have quite a lot of time on your hands, and take this just a tad serious, otherwise we aren't going to get anywhere with this.

What is Bitstorm

BitStorm Survival is a brand new survival freebuild community, spun directly off of the established 
GateCraft camp and the first non-GateCraft member of the new GateCrafters gaming network. While we'd love to describe what makes BitStorm so great, we'd rather simply put it as: It doesn't exist yet. So, grab your pickaxe and grab your shovel, and make your mark that will define BitStorm's greatness!

We are a white-listed, 64-slot, vanilla SMP community based on player interaction based completely on the players. In a sense this is an anarchy server, but more in the form of political anarchy rather than every flag-burning 13 year olds idea of anarchy. We do run Bukkit for one purpose, that is to run a WorldBorder around our map to keep it in a uniform shape/size - Which we expand as needed.


We have a fairly active playerbase and have been running the server for 3 months strong now. The server is located on dedicated server hardware in a datacenter with plenty of RAM and bandwidth/speed so in theory we could even expand past 64 players.


There is an active Mumble VoIP server for our players to use for Minecraft and other games (we've actually turned into a rather good gaming community) and the Minecraft server is available 24/7 with near-constant administration.


We are planning to re-launch our Vanilla server with a clean map for everyone to start their civilizations on 11/11/11 or whenever Notch/Mojang decides to release - So right now the server and player population is a little dead but it will certainly kick up again.



If you are interested in a server like this, you can learn a little more about us here: http://binarychaos.net/forum/index.php?topic=383.0


And remember, even if you don't agree with all of the rules/guidelines - The server is basically player run. Everything we decide on we decided with a majority vote.

I started my quest to improve performance from being annoyed with the ""[Warning] Can't keep up! Did the system time change, or is the server overloaded?"" messages.  The system time did not change, and the server is not overloaded.  I run my server on an ESXi VM (the free ESXi - you can try this at home) but it is just as possible to do the same thing with a physical machine.  My Specs: 4600+, 6GB RAM, 40 GB HD.  Full backups daily, incremental backups every hour.  Nothing fancy, but not shit either.  

My quest is not over, I have not resolved those messages by mere software changes alone, but I will, eventually.  I will update these instructions as things change, or I discover more/better things to do.  

Feel free to use the following tips and tricks I have found.  Most of these revolve around using the java server itself (minecraft_server.jar), not the minecraft_server.exe.  You cannot control the options on the exe file as easy.  Do not panic, it is very easy to run the java version.  

I will also focus my attention on GNU/Linux (specifically Ubuntu 10.10 x64) as that is what I've found to best allow me to do everything I need.  Any x64 GNU/Linux would do.  As would any x64 version of BSD, Unix, Mac, or Windows.  Everything I will mention is possible in all OS's, however, my instructions will be focused on a single one.  Also, links I provide I found to be the most helpful for me.  Your Google foo may differ.

First, [install](http://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/java) the [x64 Java version](http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) - you will need this to allocate enough RAM.  (Enough is subjective.  Change value as desired, and allowed by the limits of your hardware.)  I found using the /opt directory quite handy, as its unused in Ubuntu, so I could put Minecraft, c10t, Java, etc, all as subdirs of /opt.

For my Ubuntu setup, I knew I didn't need swap (I have plenty of RAM), so I turned it off.
&gt;sudo swapoff -a

The most common tip, and the easiest to implement - change the amount of RAM your java process gets allocated.  How much hardware will limit how high you can go (obviously).

Here are a few examples, using different notations and values. (Minecraft_Mod is for hMod, craftbukkit.jar for Bukkit) These are easiest to put into a batch file or shell script (server_nogui.sh for hMod, start.sh for bukkit) Ex:

    java -Xms2G -Xmx2G -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui
    java -Xms3072M -Xmx3072M -jar Minecraft_Mod.jar nogui
    java -Xms2048M -Xmx2048M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui
    java -Xms2048M -Xmx2048M -jar craftbukkit.jar nogui

Next trick is to run the world inside a RAM disk.  Now, because the world is held within RAM, things become more volatile than using a HD, but it becomes much faster.  BEFORE you create this ramdisk, you need to move your world to a different folder.  Once this ramdisk is mounted, the world folder will be empty (or so it appears - you can unmount the ramdisk to see the files if you haven't moved them out).

Below assumes Minecraft is ""installed"" in the /opt/minecraft folder.
Add this line to your /etc/fstab

&gt;ramdisk /opt/craftbukkit/world tmpfs mode 1777,size=512m

Or if you are running hMod:
&gt;ramdisk /opt/minecraft/bin/world tmpfs mode 1777,size=512m

Or if you are running vanilla
&gt;ramdisk /opt/minecraft/world tmpfs mode 1777,size=512m

On reboot, this mounts the ramdisk onto your world folder.  If you do not want to wait for a reboot (who does?)
&gt;sudo mount /opt/craftbukkit/world


Or
&gt;sudo mount /opt/minecraft/world

Or
&gt;sudo mount /opt/minecraft/bin/world

Now, copy your world back to the /opt/minecraft/bin/world, /opt/minecraft/world, or /opt/craftbukkit/world folder, and you should be able to start up your server.  I gave the ramdisk 512 MB because, shit, why not?  I only use 137 MB right now, but I like to know I have plenty of room to grow.  If I get close to exceeding that, I'll increase it.

Here are the scripts I use to start and stop my server.  Remember, I to also run backups every hour off the entire /opt/craftbukkit or /opt/minecraft  directory, which includes this ramdisk world, so at worst you will lose an hour.  These scripts, together perform the following tasks:

1. Set ownership of ramdisk folder
1. Copy the world from the HD world area (named backup in my case) to ramdisk.
1. Run the script: server_nogui.sh which launches the server.
1. Once server_nogui.sh finishes (server stops, crashes, etc), run the script stopserver.sh which removes the stale HD staging area, recreates a fresh HD staging area and moves the files from ramdisk to the HD staging area.

I found when I remounted the ramdisk, or rebooted, it had root privs.  So I need to be there to launch my server (no big deal for me) as my first script requires sudo privs.  I ~think~ I can get away without it, but I didn't want to risk it.  Scripts assume they are located in the /opt/minecraft, or /opt/minecraft/bin directory, and you run them from there as well.

I play over at damnhigh.com a lot, but I wanted to set something up too.

So I've been messing around with some plug-ins just to have fun.

So far it's a fairly new map. I have plenty of kits to get you started off doing whatever, I also just recently added the grappling hook mod and I've been messing around with that. It's fun.

I might try Stargates again in awhile.
Either way, I'm messing around with some plug-in's so the map is not going to stay right now. Once I get everything situated I will start with a new map and we will get things rolling.

Until then it's just dicking around, having fun and doing whatever.

If you'd like to come hang out, say hi(gh) or whatever, send me a message for the URL.

The server has been up and active for roughly 3 months + and we've had great success  as far as quality members go.  It seems, however, that a large percentage of people that join will be active and great companions/builders for 2-3 weeks and then disappear afterwards. We've got a solid, albeit small core group of regulars, but we'd love to add more.  

A little about the server:
 
Specs-

* Server Type: SMP (Survival Multi-Player) 

* Mods: Hey0

* CPU: AMD Phenom II X6 1055t

* Memory: (4GB DDR 1333)

* Graphics: Nvidia GTS 250

* Hard Drive Space: 3.64TB

* WAN: Comcast Cable (20mb down, 5mb up)

* Location: Western IL, USA

* Active 24 hours a day 7 days a week

There are three admins, all of us in our mid-twenties and up, and all of us know each other in RL.  We also have a couple moderators who have been with us since server start up with limited admin commands. All admins have access, remote or on site, to the server.  This is a relatively vanilla server, minus the Hey0 mod, so there is no spawning of blocks/items.

We don't have a white list, but upon first logging into the server, you will not have dig/build rights until you do a quick application on the server's website.  Since implementing this 2.5 months ago, we've had one griefing incident, which was caught within 5 minutes of it happening and I personally rebuilt the member's home for them.  Applications typically take anywhere between 5 minutes to 24 hours to be approved, dependent on if one of us are in game at the time.  I always check the applications nightly.

We have two main, settled areas.  Our initial spawn, and a new city area.  The city is an organized server-wide project, with a planning thread in our forums.  Our current spawn point will start you in this new city, however there are Hey0 warps to our initial community area.  There is also a google map of our server on the website that was last updated 4 days ago.

I will be on for another 2 or 3 hours tonight, and I am typically on or available from 6pm central time to 10pm central M-F, broader during the weekend.  We'd love to see some new faces!

* **Description**: AevusCraft (1.6.2) is an already well-established survival PVE server. The server has been running for over six months. We have a solid, dedicated player base of all ages. There are up to 60 slots available with on average 15-20 players on at a time. We use many plugins to enhance the game experience and provide the server with excellent anti-griefing precautions. Our primary plugins are Towny and McMMO. Towny is a plugin that enables players to join or make their own towns with protections. McMMO is a skill building plugin that rewards players for their hard work by intensifying survival skills and with Towny, they both greatly enhance the game making everything you do very rewarding and fun. The theme of our server is time travel, though players are free to build what they want, and there are plenty of quest sites in the works! We’re growing everyday and always looking for more players!

* **Rules**: NO griefing, stealing or cheating. This is a server that accepts everyone, so discriminating and/or harassing language is strictly forbidden. Please respect the staff and all players.

Today I will be discussing how our Secret Shoppers verification is going to work. Last week in the [Community Poll](http://redd.it/xbtda) the community voted to form a group of ""Secret Shoppers"" that would go into servers and check to see if a server meets it's tagged criteria.

Some main points of this program that I want to talk about:

* **Secret Shoppers will never identify themselves, anyone who claims that they are one are not.**

* Anyone who outs themselves as a Secret Shopper will be removed from the program.

* /r/MCServers Moderators will not be part of the program.

* Do not ask to become a Secret Shopper, we will ask various users around the community.

* We will post a Google Docs list of verified servers and give verified posters a flair indicating so. 

* This program will take up to 2-3 weeks to get ready to launch (I do have a job).


If you have any ideas/thoughts/rules please post them below and we can talk about it!

This iteration of Valikorlia was made after the owner of our old server shut it down. A dedicated group of other players then took the opportunity to re-evaluate, tweak, and balance every aspect of the game, and launch the next Valikorlia. Many of our current players were so dedicated to the community that they took the risk and invested their time and effort into making this new server just as good as the old one.

Valikorlia uses a plethora of mods and plugins to enhance the pillars of Minecraft play: Mining, Combat, and Building. This ensures the most immerse experience, while still staying true to the game's roots. The RPG plugin Heroes has been extensively tweaked by our admins, with each class built from the ground-up, and is designed to have a unique playstyle. iConomy is used as a superstructure for the server economy by providing a currency and shops. Towny allows players to make towns, form alliances/rivalries, go to war, and secure territory for themselves. We also have dungeons for groups and individuals to level in, and we plan on adding instanced dungeons as well. This makes for a fun, not-tedious leveling experience.

As a player myself, I can say with confidence that this is the best Minecraft community i've ever had the privilige of playing on. The community is extremely strong: we have our own Ventrillo server, and have all been playing with each other for a long time. Our community is very laid-back accepting: a new player won't have a problem assimilating. However, the community is also lively, and as such, there is always enough drama to keep things interesting in the game, and for town politics to really have a purpose. Check our server out. You won't be disappointed.

I have pluggins in place to prevent it from happening. Griefing is allowed, stealing is allowed, and PVP is allowed. The only game-changing plugin I have is MCMMO, this adds an RPG style leveling system, the more you do things, the more you get better at them.

We are a 100% no nonsense Minecraft server. Mostly vanilla except for anti-grief/cheat and some warps are set up to alleviate the longer walking distances. We are moderated 24/7 with highly manipulable rollbacks installed to ensure there won't be any long-lasting damage caused by griefing. Our moderation team won't hesitate to kick or ban at the slightest sign of bullshit or douchebaggery.

Server Specs:

* 16GB DDR3 RAM
* 3.2 GHz 6 core processor
* 64GB SSD
* 1TB Western Digital HDD

We are hosted at the [Nexcess](http://www.nexcess.net/) data center in Dearborn, Michigan with a 1Gbps connection to the Internet. Our server can handle quite the load, so no need to worry about lag. Theoretically, we can support well over 120 players, but until Minecraft's multi-core support improves our max caps out well before that.

Here at NoBullcraft you start out as a [Drifter] and advance your way up to [Resident]. Residents are more respected, can use lava/TNT, and have the ability to lock chests. The best way to achieve this status is to play on the server, don't be a dick, and most importantly, don't ask to become one! New Residents are selected democratically by current residents, via a voting process held by one of our Mods or Admins.

Our server runs solely on donations, so we ask that if you enjoy playing then you at the very least consider showing us some support. We understand not everyone has the ability to do that, but we greatly appreciate all those that help keep us up and running! Our server will remain public for all to enjoy as long as we are able to pay our monthly fees. In-game, donators will receive a special custom tag of their choice, as well as super awesome protected plots of land...and we sure love donators &lt;3

Any further questions can be asked and answered either in-game, or here on this thread.

We look forward to seeing you online!

**ANOTHER EDIT: I don't suggest you enter the server and ask if you can join anyone's team. Most teams do not want to recruit people they are seeing for the first time. I suggest you either get to know some players on the server first or sign up on the forum at [Kingdom-SMP.com](http://kingdom-smp.com) and apply to a team there under ""Teams""**

Hey guys a few months back I posted my server here and since then it has improved a lot.

**IP:** Play.Kingdom-SMP.com

Website:[http://Kingdom-SMP.com](http://Kingdom-SMP.com)


**Rules:** No Hacking **(THIS INCLUDES XRAY, YOU WILL GET CAUGHT)**, No Logging out during PVP, No Spamming
Allowed: Killing, Looting, Destruction!
Monsters: Enabled


**The spawn town is a safezone and is protected by a 125 block radius. **


Our server objective: Kingdoms at War is a Minecraft SMP server that aims to create an engaging experience for hardcore winner-takes-all type of pvp players through team warfare. The Kingdoms At War server has a protected spawn town and only has a few rules including no hacking, spamming, and logging out during pvp. Players can build and hunt alone or form alliances with other players in the server to build and protect towns, fortresses, and more. In addition, players can raid, loot, and destroy other towns and fortresses to gain wealth and wage war against other factions. We highly encourage players to band together for protection and attacking other groups. If that isn't your cup of tea that's fine, you can do whatever you wish in this server, you are not forced to be friendly with anyone.


It has been a month or more since we have started and the server's quality has increased a lot since then.
We are extremely active in catching cheaters and xrayers and have numerous plugins installed to help catch these people. We also have our own unique plugin for team management and chat installed! The team plugin doesn't add any annoying features or permissions though, it simply helps organize teams and gives them the ability to use team chat. At the launch of the server there were only a few real teams but since then many more teams to join have taken root in the server. All in all the server has become a much more engaging experience since we first began. You can see the full list of team commands for the server here: http://www.kingdom-smp.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=129


Also our server is **lag free!** The server is located in texas, but a large majority of our players are located in Australia and they say that they never get lag.


**TL:DR:  In our server players form teams (or don't if they don't want to) and make bases and raid other team's bases, resulting in epic pvp battles that you probably won't find on other servers. **

The commandment, ""No griefing"" is too ambiguous and is left far too open to interpretation.  Is the mindless destruction of property griefing?  If my history lessons serve me well, that is what it originally meant in the world of Minecraft.  This is a new age of Minecraft, however, and simply disagreeing with ones own ideals on how to survive in this blocky, mixed up world, one shouts, ""GRIEFER, BURN THEM AT THE STAKE!""  

What I am suggesting, Almighty God Emperor Server Administrators with whom I devotedly serve and follow until the ends of time, that you perhaps give us, the ignorant masses, a clearer meaning of what thou mean when thy commands us ""Thou shalt not grief.""

Is the mindless destruction of property, ""griefing?""
Is the creative destruction of property, ""griefing?"" (Traps, ect?""
Is stealing, ""griefing?""
Is enforcing the law of survival of the fittest, ""griefing?"" (PVP)
Is journeying into someone elses mine and harvesting their virgin resources, ""griefing?""

We are merely ignorant masses and can't not ever possibly hope to known the Divine Will of the Almighty God Emperor Server Administrators but surely They can remember that we ignorant masses are, indeed, ignorant when thy issues commandments.

Right now me and a few people I have invited from Reddit and other places (6 or 7 people so far) have slowly started to build the city of Aldona.

Here is the album: http://imgur.com/a/X43IE Note that a lot is still under construction and we are no where near done. Multiple people have projects going on.

If you would like to join the server please PM me on reddit but please note our following rules:

We are trying more here to create a community - right now we have little restrictions as in anyone can pour water or lava (fire is disabled) as well as public storage and a community that is helping each other.

- No random exploring. You can explore for a bit but try not to go too far as it makes the map bigger and can cause lag as the server software is still pretty buggy. (14mb map so lots to be explored still)

- If building within the city limits please try and make your building fit in with local architecture but we arn't anal about this many people have different buildings

- If you want to build a public building make sure to just ask in chat and see if its ok and let the community have a say in it - we all like to help out on ""community builds"" I guess you could say.

We arn't strict but are just looking for people who want a smaller community of trusted people (no griefers) all working together.

So if your interested let me know.

EDIT - I will be inviting a few people at a time so as to manage the new players and to make sure no griefing occurs.

EDIT 2 - We have had a lot of people interested and a lot of newcomers so if you havn't recieved an invite yet don't worry.

* **Description**: Minecraft Risk is a game of total war. Teams fight for control of a territory map, until only one remains. The victors receive tokens which can be used during any match for bonuses and special abilities.

Territories are generated and defined over top a minecraft world.  The territories defined can be claimed by your team by being within the territory for some time.  Each territory has a perk assigned to it (*shown on an item frame*).  Every territory with a similar perk will stack up in level to give you better gear.  Claiming territories and killing other players will sometimes give you tokens which can be used to purchase items and power ups throughout the game.

All tokens won, mcmmo levels, and inventory contents will persist through out rounds.  To access the in-game token shop, click the Diamond in your inventory.  Mousing over the Emerald will show you your token balance.

Each team gets a private chat channel.  The command `/ch t` will take you to it.  The command `/ch g` will put you back into the global chat channel.  Use the command `/risk help` to see a full list of current commands.

On death, players are respawned into a graveyard (*the end*).  Depending on some conditions, you will be taken back into the normal world after a short amount of time.  Instant revives can be purchased from the shop to skip this.

To win the round, a Team must eliminate all other standing teams.  When the rounds ends, the board will be reset, Award Tokens will be given to the victor, and a new board will be chosen randomly based on the amount of players online.

*Please report any bugs to the admins.  All known bugs from Beta release have been resolved.*

There is also a Factions server featured.  Tokens won on the RISK server, will be able to be withdrawn as emeralds on the Factions server.

* **Joining**: Go through the Lapis portal in the lobby to join the Risk server.  The Obsidian portal will take you the the Factions server.  The command `/server` will show you a list of available servers you can join.  You can join any of the servers in the group by doing `/server &lt;name&gt;`.

* **Rules**: No Cheating. No advertising. Be Respectful to other players and staff.

Did I mention we are cat-themed? Meow.

Nobody except the owners listed below have the ability to spawn in items/Catz, and we never will so don't even bother asking. The less the admins interfere with the in-game economy, the better.

* **Description**: Green Bay Minecraft is a tight-knit server, started by a couple guys in their thirties.  Being an old guy/gal isn't a prerequisite to joining this server, mature young players are welcome too.  We run a Mob Arena, PVP Arena, Mall (with user shops) and a School for non-combat skill training.  All players are safe from PvP in or near spawn and PVP is disabled for the first 30 minutes.  Check PVP timer with /pvptimer check and you have the option to remove your own PVP protection early if you choose.  Once you join the server you will spawn in the ""House of Spawn"", everything you need to know is on the roof.  In the basement there is a casino with a few slot machines, Notch who repairs your tools, weaps and armor and of course the server jail.  There is a Nether Portal in the span house and in the basement there is an End portal but it's hidden so you have to be clever or ask a fellow Minecrafter for a hint.  A live world-map can be found on our website, this shows the entire 3,000 x 3,000 world with faction and region territories highlighted.  Creating a faction costs $5,000 and each land claim costs $1,000.  To make money when you're starting out, just do /sell hand command to sell what you are holding.  /bal to check your balance.  All commands are posted on ugbattle.com.

* **Rules**: This is a ‘no warning’ server, if anyone is caught cheating.. or even suspected of cheating they are getting the INSTA-BAN HAMMER. Server policy is when in doubt press BAN. There’s no shortage of responsible players who would be more than happy to take your place. Grieving is allowed so use factions /f claim command to protect your territory. If you die enough and lose enough power you can have this land taken from you so be careful. You start with 20 power, you lose 6 power each time you die and you will gain power at 1 power every 5 minutes up to a 20 power max. Each power enables you to claim a 16x16 area of land bedrock to sky. If you take on multiple faction members, your faction 'max power' increases, factions have a max of 20 members. Random killing is allowed, bullying is not. Random occasional killing of another player to take whatever loot they drop is acceptable but killing the same player over and over is not. When you kill someone you get their head and you can wear it or use it as a decoration in your home or shop, they are quite fun to collect. Repeat killing is only allowed during a raid or in self defense if your victim keeps coming back at you. My advice to all users, just act like you would in RL and ‘hopefully’ you won’t get killed.. much. When a player kills another player, the killer can keep whatever the victim drops, give it back, destroy it or sell it off, this is up to the killer. Absolutely no mods are allowed on this server, this includes mini-map, macros, etc.. If you are caught using any mods you will be insta-banned, no questions asked, no backsies. Texture packs are allowed, Xray is not. Exploiting game or plugin bugs to your advantage is a bannable offense. If you discover a 'bug' and you don't report it, you will probably be banned. Mods can ban anyone at anytime for any reason. All bans are final, if you feel you have been banned unfairly, feel free to vent on our forum.

The basic premise is that you spawn in a random location in the world, and there is no global chat. You are free to use local chat to seek out others and build a civilization, or live on your own.


*Death results in a 6 hour ban, so there is some incentive to avoid dying.*

The white-list helps reduce the number of griefers and hackers, when they do get caught its easy to remove them, and prevent a continuous log-on of alts. I'm very lax about the whitelist - there are no special requirements to play.

We run just a few major plugins, mostly there to give the ""apocalypse"" feel. We have towny installed to protect your builds, within your town, which you have to pay for by collecting gold and other resources, then travel with it to our server ""bank"" to sell it. This trip can be dangerous, so you have to learn to always be alert. People have established several towns, and started building roads between them, as well as to the bank. We also have a mail system to help make global communication possible, while still fitting with the theme. You can mail letters, and in a few minutes it will arrive at the recipient in the hand of a villager.

We have several active players, and the server is constantly evolving. Being in our server doesnt mean you'll always be the ""noob,"" towns are constantly being created, destroyed, and moved. With the new 1.2 update coming out soon we will be expanding the map area, and many towns are planning to move their bases further out into the new areas.  So now's a great time to join.

Welcome to Thunderdome bitch. Keep your head down and form alliances to survive life on the inside. Toil in the mines and stack your money secretly to earn new ranks with access to new cell blocks. Oh shit, guard saw your shank. Hand it over or kill his ass and run. New cell blocks contain more profitable mines and cooler features in general. As factions compete for dominance, deals are struck with guards who look the other way. Money exchanges hands silently and contraband floats undetected through the prison. There's also a rumor of an old forgotten escape route out of the prison but either no one knows where it is or they keep it to themselves. Will you try to find it? Or will you work hard and earn your way out of this death trap? The choices are yours to make and you get out what you put in. A light RP and imagination will definitely make it more fun but its not necessary to have a good time. Try thinking outside the box!

Welcome to Thunderdome bitch. Keep your head down and form alliances to survive life on the inside. Toil in the mines and stack your money secretly to earn new ranks with access to new cell blocks. Oh shit, guard saw your shank. Hand it over or kill his ass and run. New cell blocks contain more profitable mines and cooler features in general. As factions compete for dominance, deals are struck with guards who look the other way. Money exchanges hands silently and contraband floats undetected through the prison. There's also a rumor of an old forgotten escape route out of the prison but either no one knows where it is or they keep it to themselves. Will you try to find it? Or will you work hard and earn your way out of this death trap? The choices are yours to make and you get out what you put in. A light RP and imagination will definitely make it more fun but its not necessary to have a good time. Try thinking outside the box!

A state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority. 2.) Absence of government and absolute freedom of the individual, regarded as a political ideal. That would imply that there are no moderators, no land protection, no plugins except ones to prevent players from going outside of the games natural limitations (as in, NoCheat and Spamhammer and nothing else.) To be clear, I don't mind servers with moderation. I'm more of an anarchy person myself, but I understand why there would be moderation on a server. But to call a server anarchy and have moderators and admins is retarded. And furthermore, it's just a massive superiority complex situation for the admins.
And before anybody says ""Moderators are required for an anarchy server to work right! Otherwise hackers would mess things up!"" I'd like to present 2b2t.net as evidence that NoCheat and an antispam plugin such as Spamhammer are more than enough to keep gameplay fair. And there are no moderators.

FORUM:  covecraftpvp.forumotion.com

CoveCraft is an open-world pvp pirate themed server.  The plugins have been balanced so that you are never -completely- safe, but your towns are realistically protected.

Raiders will have lots of fun here.  Players used to Creative servers will probably have trouble.

Towny is fully set up and perfectly calibrated with balance in mind.

Dozens of hand made dungeons are scattered around the map. Some are above ground, and some are hidden underground. All are full of tricks, traps, monsters, and loot.

Beating an 'epic' dungeon for the first time will give you a title (ex: thwhodini the bone breaker, for defeated the BoneBreaker Dungeon)

Screenshots of the server can be found in this thread:  http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/810839-10-covecraft-pirates-on-the-high-seas-pvp-towny-iconomy-no-whitelist-custom-terrain-generation-247-dungeons/

VIP perks are balanced and not OP, yet still provide an edge to players who know what they're doing.

Hi there, minecrafters!

DrFunkesMC is a 24/7 Survival Server, over a year old and still up and running! Have trouble finding a long term server? Tired of dealing with tyrannical admins and moderators? Constantly getting your hard worked creations ruined by immature griefers? DrFunkesMC let's you play minecraft as it's supposed to be played.

**Plugins and Server Details**

DrFunkesMC runs close to vanilla, no crazy plugins to distract you. All player have access to /home and /spawn commands. All players are given building rights upon being whitelisted, that means no confusing permissions or steps you have to go through. But don't fear, griefers can't hurt you! Our admins have various tools to detect and undo griefing of any sort. Every user has the ability to lock their own chests, so only you can access your own items.

Just like was mentioned in the title, we have our very own [map of the server](http://drfunkesmc.com:8088/map/pigmap-default.html) available online! Our latest map is still only a few days old, so there's plenty of undiscovered areas yet to be explored. All mobs are on, as well as creeper damage. Both the Nether and The End are accessible as well.

**Moderating Style and Rules**

We don't let the crazies run our server, we're non-intrusive and let everyone play in their own style. Our admins and moderators are all active players, and are almost always the server's IRC channel, #mc. We don't spawn items, for anyone, not even ourselves. Every block we have has been mined by hand, we play fair on this server.

We're also very open to questions, comments, or suggestions. If any thing is unclear to you, or bothering you, we aim to fix it. Just let us know, we don't bite.

A well written and detailed Rules and Code of Conduct can be found on our website (check the tabs to find all our pages), everyone who wishes to play with us should familiarize themselves with the rules. We're all chill people, but we don't like rule breaking. We make sure to enforce all our rules in order to retain the quality of our server.

**How To Apply** (In case you missed it above.)

Applying is easy! All you have to do is visit our [website](http://drfunkesmc.com:8088/blog/) and fill out the Whitelist Application, you'll be emailed as soon as we can send it! While you wait to be whitelisted check out our [map](http://drfunkesmc.com:8088/map/pigmap-default.html) and member list, or even pop into IRC to say hello!

See ya, in-game!

Theoretically, we can support well over 120 players, but until Minecraft's multi-core support improves our max is around 40-50 players playing simultaneously.

Here at NoBullcraft you start out as a [Drifter] and advance your way up to [Resident]. Residents are more respected, can use lava/TNT, and have the ability to lock chests. The best way to achieve this status is to play on the server, don't be a dick, and most importantly, don't ask to become one! New Residents are selected democratically by current residents, via a voting process held by one of our Mods or Admins.

Our server runs solely on donations, so we ask that if you enjoy playing then you at the very least consider showing us some support. We understand not everyone has the ability to do that, but we greatly appreciate all those that help keep us up and running! Our server will remain public for all to enjoy as long as we are able to pay our monthly fees. In-game, donators will receive a special custom tag of their choice, as well as super awesome protected plots of land...and we sure love donators &lt;3

Any further questions can be asked and answered either in-game, or here on this thread.

We look forward to seeing you online!

* Do not use give lightly. Perhaps to give bedrock if you sacrifice 10 diamonds to an OP. Or other 'fair' ways to get unobtaniums.

* PvP everywhere, so you have to be careful with your sword. Encourage PvP against the other faction. But hey, why not have backstabers and betrayers?

* Are not grief protected. I am not a griefer, let me make that clear. But let me paint a picture. The main town has a solid gold statue. Say a player were to spend time and effort finding similar players who may want to preform a heist of this statue, they then spend a few minecraft days digging under the town, to try and hollow out the statue. All the while trying not to look suspicious. They dig up, aiming for the statue, but disaster strikes, one of the blocks under the statue had redstone on! It's set off an array of note blocks, and redstone torches in the mayor's house! Do you run? Or try and get one of those precious gold blocks? Knowing the moment someone see's your name you'll be an outlaw. And everyone will be hunting you down. I feel that would add some depth. But maybe that's just me.

But I don't want one of these chaos servers. No whitelist, nothing to encourage human decency, they really are just chaos. Everyone ends up building thousands of blocks away from everyone else until they have diamond everything. Then they go and terrorise anyone that's new.

It's fairly vanilla, save for a few plugins ( but these are just for administration ).  Right now the current plugins are: map, LWC, ExactSpawn, Realms, AfkKick.  But I am open to suggestions.  I will probably add something for Minecarts as well in the future, like Minecart Mania....

I'm looking for some nice regulars just looking for a nice virgin server to build on.  Or to go have some adventures and explore.  Basically I'd love to make the server as ""multiplayer"" as I can.  The one aspect of Minecraft that makes me feel so lonely in the game is the lack of interactions with other humans.  Sure there's always an army of Creepers out there ready to hug me, but those relationships usually end in a quick bang.

I also don't like having/using what I view as ""cheats"", like the using the /give command.  I like to know that I mined all those blocks out of the ground, like a man.  Right now, /tp is active, as well as a few /kits, but that's to cater to some of the players on the server.  I would really love to remove them, but I don't want to drive away the few players that are here.  If I can enough people who enjoy playing MC like I do, I feel that will be the appropriate time to remove these ""cheats"".

I'd love to have a community going, group builds/projects, large structures.  It'd be nice to have someone to chat with, or see what they build.  I don't really care about any specific theme or anything, build whatever you please.

I think my only big rules are don't grief and try not to mess with anyone else's builds.

and I have a basic ( read: ugly ) website set up for the server at the same address [REMOVED].  There are daily cartographs auto-posted there, as well as a dynamic live map using the google maps API.  And a simple online list.  I may plan on creating a forum there if enough people join the server.

Also, right now the spawn area is protected, and you have to be in at least the vip group to build at the spawn.  But everyone is free to freebuild outside of spawn.  If you would like something protected, get in contact with me in game, or by e-mail ( magiik1@gmail.com )

This is going to be a private server to help keep the community tightly knit as well as to help minimize the potential for griefing.

Since we just launched yesterday afternoon, we have yet to do any real building. We've mined a good cache of resources and setup a decent mining outpost.

One of our ideas is to create a huge theme park with rides/attractions (roller-coasters, boat rides, etc.) based on video game, movie and television references. Eventually we could offer up our save file for download so that others can enjoy our work. Though this not a strict guideline, we just ask that you think BIG and be as creative as possible! :)

A few Rules:

* You are welcome to build whatever you want, but please make sure you are not building too closely to another player's work.  It would also be nice if you'd let the rest of us know what and where you're going to build, as others may want to give suggestions or participate.

* Feel free to explore a little bit, but don't venture too far off.  We'd like to keep the map size manageable by the server software.

* Please respect the work of everyone here, try not to change something major without seeing if it's okay first.  Griefing will not be tolerated.

* Think EPIC! Let's work together to make something awesome and fun to build at the same time.  Whether you love creating huge structures or hollowing out gigantic mine shafts, there are lots of good times ahead.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, reply here or send me a message and I will give you the server info. Thanks, and happy crafting!

Description:

--------------------------------------------------------

You think you're good at Minecraft survival? Are mobs too stupid? Is hardcore to girly? Are you tired of being alive? Then put your skills to the test. Only the best of the best can survive in this incredibly hostile world.

We are Hawks and Doves and we present to you the hardest, most rage inducing server you've ever played on. Most of you will join and within minutes come back here on Reddit to down vote us because you aren't good enough (don't be this guy).

Has anyone managed to master this world? No, no one has ever manage to beat the map, many make it far, but when it comes down to pure ingenuity and grit, no one has enough. (Oh did I mention the entire world is made up of floating islands?)

Despite the hostile introduction, the people are quite mature and nice. Since all immature players can't make it past the first night without rage quitting, we don't have problems with immaturity. Although introducing yourself may be difficult. You may want to establish a base first, so you actually have enough time to open your chat bar. Also, griefing is allowed, but not encouraged. The map is hard enough without players attacking eachother. Their is a protection plugin to help focus attention on PvE and not PvP/raiding. Protection is easy to use, but it is limited.

Also, tired of learning all the commands that go with any new server? With our new system everything can be handled form an in-game menu! Just because the server is hard doesn't mean you have to remember all those annoying commands!

---------------------------------------------------------

Rules: [1]Be Mature [2]Don't complain when you die. [3]No hacked clients. [4]No excessive griefing. [5] No massive animal farms.

Plugins: [Essential] [Ships] [Bloodmoon] [Extra Hard Mode] [mcMMO] [Terraincontrol] [Clear Lag]

For a while now I have been looking for a small private group of people to build some nice large scale projects with. I have over 2 years of building experience and have been part of groups like this before. I live in Perth, Western Australia, GMT +8. If anyone is willing to let me tag along with them just reply to this post or message me.

**Ok since there have been so many responses I will host the server but the limit is 6 people at a time. Please PM me if you are still interested so I can try and narrow down the amount of people, although I may decide to make it seven or even eight people**

Things you need to include in the application:

Prior experience in both Minecraft in general and servers like this.

Reason(s) why you would like to play.

Your In game name so I can whitelist you.

Your skype name if you want to skype.

What time zone you are in.

And finally your age (be truthful).

**Thank you.**

* **Server Address/IP:**  minecraft.gameserv.co:26061
* **Game Type:**  Survival (Extra Hard), SMP, PVP

~~--------------------------------------------------------------~~

* **Description:**  If Minecraft has gotten too easy and you want a challenge this is the place to be.  You're all but guaranteed to die here.  Server difficulty is massively ramped up from vanilla settings and there are several gameplay changes in effect.  Our goal is to provide an atmosphere where individuals can enjoy a strong and challenging PVE survival atmosphere while still being able to engage in PVP outside of the spawn city walls if they choose.  For those seeking a simpler life free of monsters &amp; PVP they have the option of working to become a citizen and building inside the city walls where these features are disabled.  They will however need to suffer with everyone else until Citizenship is earned.  Those choosing to live outside the city walls will continue to remain immune from PVP when standing within their claims.  There is however a cost to living far away - convenience.  There is only one warp on this server (/spawn) and it's on a lengthy cooldown.

**NOTE:  mcMMO has been tuned drastically down from default settings for balance.**

**NOTE:  There are no donation perks.  There are no donations at all.**

**NOTE:  There are no handouts or advantages given period.**

A few notable gameplay changes:

* 1)  Mobs are much more plentiful.
* 2)  A variety of additional blocks are impacted by gravity.
* 3)  Cave-ins are very real risk of mining.
* 4)  All mobs have new abilities and immunities.
* 5)  The deeper you dig the more dangerous it becomes.
* 6)  Crops have a chance of dying.
* 7)  Buckets can't move water source blocks.
* 8)  Pigmen are always hostile.
* 9)  Etc.

* **Rules:**  Have fun but be respectful.  Individuals found to be cheating (this includes X-ray), glitching, or unable to control themselves in an adult manner will be banned without warning.  Beyond that, it's okay for people to get upset from time to time but don't go out of your way to be a dick.  Raiding unprotected chests is allowed.  Destruction of other people's builds just because you can however is not.  We've provided the tools necessary to protect yourselves and if people choose to not use them it's their responsibility.  Chain killing and spawn camping will also not be tolerated.

* **Description**: 

When you first log on you're placed inside Vicky, our portal hub. From there you can either go to our modded up cat-themed SMP Minecraft server, Craft Cat, or over to our mostly vanilla SMP server, NoBullcraft. Both servers require you to complete a short ""test"" before you can play, which won't take longer than 10 minutes and just lets you know some information regarding the server and its rules. We figure if you can't take the time to complete such a short task, are you really going to contribute  anything to the server?

**Craft Cat** - This is our well established, cat-themed SMP Minecraft world. It has BOSeconomy, ChestShop, McMMO, and several other plugins installed to enhance the overall Minecraft experience. Please pardon our dust at spawn, we are currently undergoing a huge community build and giving it a major overhaul.

**NoBullcraft** - NoBullcraft is perfect if you're looking for a simple, delicious, vanilla-flavored Minecraft adventure. Only plugins here are for protection against griefers and hackers.

We enjoy planning things such as PvP battles at the Colosseum, raids in our custom-built PvE arenas, building contests, and many other activities to keep the players entertained and the community bustling. For a very small sample of our builds, check out what players have posted [here.](https://nobullcraft.com/discussion/1561/show-off-your-builds-here-and-have-it-posted-on-the-official-nobullcraft-facebook/p1)

There are currently about 8-12 people on every night and there are several timezones that people play in. Ideally the population will be around 15-20 on every night. The server population will be capped once we hit our optimal level so there is no intention of making this server into a big server. The server has also been recently upgraded with some donations so lag should not be an issue.

**Website:** [damNation.eu](http://damNation.eu)

**Server Address/IP:** *damNation.eu:25565*

**Game Play Types:** A bit of all-in-one: PvE/Adventure/Survival/Build-friendly/Creative/Projects/Survival Games/PvP games/SkyBlock/Parkour/The Dropper etc.


**Description:** Age limit 15+! No Map Resets! Very Build Friendly settings! Protected Building! High Quality Special Projects! Adventures with custom adventure setup! Treasure Hunts! Full View Distance! Lots of Redditors ...and the Friendliest Staff and Community you will ever find! Tourists may play ""Freedom"" (survival world with Grief Prevention), Survival Games, The Dropper. For all world access; registration and application on the forum is required as this assures higher quality and less griefing and player issues.


**Rules:** 

**Important rule #1**: This server is intended for mature adults with more than half a brain and we expect EVERYONE here to behave accordingly. You must be at least 15 years of age to be considered for membership.

**2.** Be courteous and respect others. Agree to disagree. No fighting, namecalling etc. This includes not heckling or demeaning lower ranks or the Tourists!

**3.** Real world legal and societal laws and rules apply! Just use your common sense, if somebody would not like if you did it in the real world - don't do it here.

**4.** No exploits, duping, cheating, stealing, griefing etc. You get ONE chance not to do that on this server! That means no cheat clients, especially no xray/ore finders. Cheaters, thieves and vandals do not belong here. We log all block and chest interactions and will BAN you! Do not peek into chests that belong to someone. Treasure chests (marked and notified on opening) are per player and you are expected to loot those when found (we have quite a few hidden).

**5.** Leave the landscape looking natural and beautiful please. Terraform to your hearts content, but: All trees must be cut down fully, leave no tall pillars, floating junk midair, screwed up water or ugly beaches/deserts anywhere please.

**6.** No giant pixelart, voxelart, letters, flags etc (statues and real ""builds"" are ok) in the regular worlds (creative play area is the only place you may build those).

**7.** Build with some taste please: Avoid large featureless walls/floors of cobble/dirt/birch/lava etc.

**8.** Aim to build within reasonable distance from each other. Minimum distance before it is customary to ask for permission is 128 blocks (=Normal Render Distance), you can also measure this with string.

**9.** Make sure large redstone creations or machinery is turned off when not in use. We have a very powerful server, but it is still limited. Also, don't make ""annoyance machines"".

**10.** Always obey the admins &amp; moderators (red color names). Report misbehaviour, grief, exploits and bugs to staff using the forum, pm's, or mumble. Do no bother them unnecessarily, and NEVER EVER bother us for op or admin rights.

**11.** Do not spam or do commercials for other servers or any commercial services. 

**12.** You will be eligible for a FREE protected plot in the main city. You have 10 days to have a proper building there (square wood/cobble box is not proper) after which it may be taken back to the state and given to someone else (extensions only on special circumstances). The free plot may be dug to bedrock, and built up to 15-20 above ground, depending on plot. Further promotion is dependent on your ability to finish a first build.

**13.** Mobtowers/XPgrinders etc are allowed in MODERATION. Preferably with an off-switch, and do not build in heavily populated areas. You are not allowed to let any mob stack up more than about 100 in a chunk (excessive stacking of monsters is cause for warning/demotion/ban!). Furthermore, towers must be covered and look like actual builds (not like flying platforms) - follow the building rules and some aesthetics please. No one wants to see giant cobble/wood cubes in the landscape. Besides, we have EasyEnchant, so there is little use for excessive XP grinding.

**14.** On your application to enter the server: Take the key number from rule #1 (in bold) and ADD it to the key number (also in bold) from rule #8, and write the sum as answer to the last question. Thank you for understanding we only do this to make sure people read the rules properly. You will love the result of it once you get inside.

**15.** Before starting to ask a lot of questions, read the Newcomer's guide. If your question is not answered there. When you do need to ask a question, do not ask for permission to ask a question or ask for an admin by name. Just ask the question straight away, chances are someone will answer it. Please do not repeat or spam questions again and again in the chat.


**Server Hardware:** 16GB i7 2600k (Datacenter 100mbit). 100/100mbit in EU central datacenter with excellent backbone connectivity - giving good ping from all over (chosen with care). We have players from all over and we like it that way.

**Plugins:** 100+ plugins at time of writing

**Owner:** OriginalMadman   **Admins/Mods:** About a dozen in total. The red color names :). Always helpful and friendly. Our moderators are from Sweden, USA and Netherlands

Before you start playing on the server it is recommended that you read the beginners guide in the tutorials section of the forum:

[Beginners Guide!](http://www.unknown-degree.net/index.php?/topic/7-beginners-guide-for-unknown-degree-minecraft/)

The server address is: 188.165.189.187:25565

There are some rules for the server that we are going to be enforcing as much as possible, people who break these rules depending on the severity can be banned. Keep that in mind:

* Don't grief! That should be obvious, griefing is intolerable. Simple as that.
Remember your place on the server, moderators are there for a reason, anything they do is part of their role on the server.
* Don't be immature. It gets really annoying and everyone is just here to have fun. We're not expecting everyone to be robots, but you'll know if you're being annoying.
* No glitching, hacking etc. We do have anti-cheat, but we know this doesn't stop everything, if we see people hacking and glitching we'll ban you.
* Don't make extremely complicated redstone circuits that are intense on the CPU of the server, we want everyone to be able to enjoy playing the game without lag.
* Keep the server tidy! If you're in the wilderness, don't just randomly build giant poles into the sky and leave them there, we want the world to look nice too!
* Follow the rules for building set by your town leader if you're in a town.
* If you are a town leader, don't enforce stupid rules like ""I R TEH LEADER, DO WHATEVER I SAY"" because we will just take your town from you if you've managed to get a town.

Generally, it's mostly common sense. If you're contributing to the server in a good way, we'll like you, simple as that. You might even be rewarded for it!

Thanks,

&gt;* Forum. To post questions, request features, and share ideas. New updates will be posted on the forums also, as well as on the news feed on the main page.

&gt;* Gallery. Photos of the server maps and events. You can submit screenshots also, and the best ones will get featured on the front page! 

&gt;* Chat room. Place to talk with fellow DVZ players or simply hangout if you are bored and feel like chatting with someone.

&gt;* Livestream. All games are now livestreamed for anyone who cares to watch. Commentary provided by kevcar and steven while playing.


&gt;So come check out [the site](http://dwarfsvszombies.enjin.com) and let us know what you think! We hope the site will help make events easier for people to attend, and offer a better experience for you guys.

Think you're the better Minecrafter?  Willing to put those words to the test?

**Ultra Hardcore**

* Health cannot be regenerated like normal.

* You can view everyone's health by pressing 'tab'

* To get health, you must eat a golden apple or drink a potion.

* Recipes have changed.

* A golden apple requires gold ingots instead of gold nuggets.

* A glistering melon requires a gold block instead of a gold nugget.

* This functionality is all server-side.  No need to modify your client.

*If you die, you will be disconnected and will not be able to reconnect for 1 hour


  Welcome to Jackal's Den.  A Ultra Hardcore Deathban competition server.  A game is always going on, join and be a part of it!  Join the game and when your ready to begin, right click the 'randomspawn' sign in the middle of the room.  You will be plunged into the wilderness.

  This is based off of the youtube ""Mindcrack Ultra Hardcore"" series.  What is Ultra Hardcore?



  The game ends once somebody had achieved one of two goals.  If you're into PVP and such then get 50 PVP kills and you win the game!  If you like survival more then slay the Ender Dragon and bring the Dragon Egg to an admin and you will win the game!  Pvp is still enabled for you though so be careful!  Once the game is won, the server will reset and it will start all over again.  Another thing I should point out is that the Ender Dragon has fortified her defenses.  It will not be as easy as normal to slay her.  Did I mention this is hardcore?

  The server is configured as close to a vanilla server as I could achieve with UltraHardcore.  This makes beds important again.  The only non-vanilla commands are /spawn and /kit food.  The /spawn command will send you to spawn to view server news and be free from pvp for a moment.  The command has a 20 second warmup and 10 minute cooldown.  The /kit food command will give you a couple meat once in a while.  There are no other commands to help you.  Did I mention this is hardcore?

  Each game's champion will have their name added to a hall of fame at spawn.  Also you will receive a snazzy title in game so everyone knows how awesome you are.  Only one person can win a game.  Who's it gonna be?

2.5 MB/Sec upload speed &lt;--- this is a slow internet upload speed to host a minecraft server. Unfortunately I am unable to increase my upload speed so this server will have a cap of 20 players max. However, I'm willing to test pushing the limits

1) deal with the player cap/lag
2) pool our money together and rent out a professional server

To contact me, you can post in this thread. I will recieve an email notification if you do.
The best way to contact me, is through the facebook group. I have facebook on my phone and can respond much quicker that way. Also, if I recieve your message while I'm not home, it gives me time to come up with a solution by the time I get home.

40 Slots | Located in Chicago, IL | 24/7 Dedicated Server


[ Description ]
Team up, fortify, and wage war! We are a 100% survival server. Hardcore mode is enabled, meaning mobs are set to the ""very hard"" setting. Mobs will do more damage. Poison, fire, and starvation will kill you. If you can survive the monsters, then watch out the players. Because they can and will try to kill you. Death is accompanied by a 12 hour ban from the server, and a lost of faction power. Players that can survive will be rewarded with higher faction power. Allowing them to claim more land and conquer more of the server. 

Faction bases do have protection with a few exceptions. Our server runs a plugin called ""Creeperheal"" allowing craters and other damaged caused by explosions and fire to heal after a amount of time. Bases are not immune to explosions or fire. Making tactics involving TNT launchers and lighters completely viable. Another object not protected is chests that are in faction territory. Whats the point of laying siege to an enemy base, if you cannot plunder it? 

You'll need to recruit scouts, loot runners, fort defenders, and base attackers if you want to be successful. Can your faction be the champions of the realm? 

[ Spoutcraft ]
We do have Spout enabled on our server. If you use the wonderful Spoutcraft client you will gain many UI improvements that will help you enjoy the server. Such as faction tags, colored cloaks on players so you can easily tell between enemy, neutral, ally, or friend.

Spoutcraft is a standalone Minecraft client. What this means, is that it will not edit your existing Minecraft installation. Just download the executable and play. 

Get Spoutcraft

[ Rules ]
We have a simple set a rules on our server. 

1) No hacks, cheats of any kind. This includes ""X-ray"" texture packs. You will be banned, no exceptions.

2) Do not spam chat. 

3) Do not ask admins for handouts. 

4) Do not use any exploits, bugs or any other glitch, that is not intended gameplay to gain an advantage. 

We want a fair environment here guys. That said, if you do find an exploit, or a bug. We do have a bounty on them. Contact an admin and we will reward you with bonus in currency. 

[ We Are New Disclaimer ]
Our community has been around for close to a decade. This is our first official Minecraft server. That said, there may be some growing pains with the server. If you lag, keep in mind that the server is located in Chicago, IL, so if you live in say, New Zealand... You may have issues. Our website is currently being overhauled so expect a fresh site in a few days. We do have a both a ventrilo and mumble server for use by our community. Regulars on our server are welcomed to use it.

[Awesome Parkour Action](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZT35Nlnb98&amp;feature=youtu.be) with Smart Move Plugin!

---

**Overview:**

Greysoul has been ressurected! The world has been reset, and factions have been given an entirely now look! Explore the new world as a mountain traversing, Raghnallian viking, or rebuild the ruins of the once great Order of the Silk Blade, as an Orsanian Knight.

The Greysoul server is a community of active Minecrafters who have ascended into a world of battle and intrigue. The player base frequently participates in daily raids, battles, and ambushes in the brutal exchange of power and land. Here you will find your countrymen among a number of Nations; including the organized Kingdom built within a fallen civilization, and a chaotic brotherhood of Viking warriors. With the factions plug-in, it is now a better time than ever to join in this world as the Empires begin to expand outward from their home territories to uncontested lands. How will you forge your legend in this world of power and devastation? Come fight for glory, or build your name atop a mountain of gold. Earn your titles as you slay the enemy, be a ninja warrior using the smart move plugin and crawl into places your enemies could only dream of, strike down on the Tyrannical King and his legions, if you dare; or drive back the Viking hordes and wild beasts of lore untold. Whatever side you choose, the battles will be fierce and the fun will be everlasting.

As an Admin and a Game Designer, I try to balance all the classes in PVP to their fullest. If there is something that is unbalanced and or unfair, thanks to the 'Heroes' plugin, I have 100% control and can modify it on the spot. No more waiting for a plugin to update, no more waiting for weeks to get a buff or much needed nerf. That being said I can not control somethings and plugin updates are still needed if things are a major change. I can add classes, change classes, tweak damage values, and ban or limit things that are unfair to PvP.

**Server Perk**

Every server you have been a part of has died off, plugins are out of  date, and/or your cool ideas falls upon deaf ears? No more! The  Greysoul Admin and Moderators are in constant communication with the  plugin developers, giving feedback, getting adjustments, and/or  developing ENTIRELY new plugins. The well known plugin, mcMMO, which is currently beign developed by TheYeti, is one of the MAIN plugins on many RPG servers. The new MCMMO developer TheYeti and the Server Admin are in constant communication on how to better mcMMO. What  this means to you is our server is the breeding ground for new idea's  and improvements of one of the best RPG - Leveling plugins, your ideas,  critique's and opinions are taken into account and put to good use. 

New plugins developed just for Greysoul are paid for by player  donations to make this server better, for you the player. This will  continue to be the way as the plugin developers listen to our feedback  and tweak them to make our PVP experience one of balance and fun. As  long as we have donations, you will have a server that is constantly  changing for the better.

**Heroes**

Heroes is a dynamic, flexible and highly configurable class, skill and experience system. Heroes itself is the hub of your players RPG experience, boasting classes, multi-tiered and fully fleshed out. Along with classes, Heroes offers your players a new style of PvP through our well-developed skill system and our weapon + armor restrictions. No longer will your mages have the ability to use diamond swords, your rogues will no longer sneak around in their heavy diamond tunics and most importantly, you can now hurl fireballs and stun your targets. The best part of this? It's your choice how your Heroes is set up, don't want a certain skill, that's fine, you can just remove the skill and be done with it! We're working towards making everything about Heroes configurable.

---
**Classes and Skills**

---

**5 PvP Classes**

*Warrior* - Heavy Armor and beefy tank, that can use a shield and sword!

*Rogue* - Stealthy leather wearer that can sneak at full speed and backstab his enemy for massive damage.

*Archer* - Leather Armor and ranged physical dps, can use a bow and cripple their foes.

*Warlock* - Ranged magic caster adept at slowing, poisoning, and igniting their foes.

*Cleric* - An armored holy Steward that can heal and buff their allies, while smiting down their foes.

---

**1 Non PvP class**

*The Merchant* - Can Set up shop to sell and trade goods, gain levels by mining and farming.

---

**Smart Move**

Ever wish you could leap across a ravine and instead of just missing your jump and falling to your death, actually climb up the ledge of the cliff? How about diving through a small 1x1 hole in your safehouse to barely escape pursuing PvPers? This mod makes all your wildest parkour dreams come true by allowing a myriad of ways to navigate your way around the minecraft world. Climbing up iron bars, skirting your way around ledges made by half blocks, you name it and you can do it in this plug-in. You ARE Indiana motherfucking-Jones.

---

**Hero Bounty**

Some players like to make a living toiling away in the mines of Greysoul, while others might become thrifty merchants to make coin. Others in Greysoul do not fit in with the more civilized of society and spend their days mercilessly hunting the trouble makers of the land. These bounty hunters can collect bounties listed by citizens of one faction on the other. Is an enemy camping your house tirelessly? Put a bounty on their head to have other members of your faction hunt them. Was your mine destroyed by some charlatan? Put a bounty on their head and make them pay for their crime! Have fun bounty hunting with the Hero Bounty mod installed on our server!

---

**KSlopes**

Sometimes it is necessary to diverge from the normal cubic building options of vanilla minecraft, and Kslopes gives players the option of triangular blocks and other variations on the normal styles. Houses can have a sloped roof, interior architecture can take on a whole new dimension as you can craft fancy fireplaces and surreal columns with the KSlopes mod.

---

**Upcoming Plugins:**

---

   **Rope Mod**

Are you deep behind enemy lines and separated from your unit? Are you scaling cliffs with the enemy at your heels, while your team looks helplessly from below? With the rope mod, you and your allies are no longer isolated by height. The rope mod was created for all those times you wanted to rappel down a large cliff or cave. Fall damage is a thing of the past with this handy mod.

---

   **Balkons Weapon Plugin**

Weapons, weapons, weapons! This wonderful plugin adds a veritable arsenal to minecraft. Our admin team figures this plugin will have great synergy with the heroes plugin, allowing several classes multiple weapon choices for their class. From spears to warhammers, from crossbows to blowguns, this plugin will give players unlimited options in combat.

Hey guys, theheyway here. I run the server [Marvin Online](http://marvinonline.org/). It's gone through a lot of changes due to varying personal circumstances and patch updates, but I've been running it for about a year and I like to think that it's been successful so far. Given the conversation about servers and server quality popping up suddenly, I thought I'd weigh in with this little helpful guide of my own personal observations.


**What's success?** First off, what do you *want* your server to be? An awesome creative server? Hardcore SMP? Pure vanilla? Mocha? There's a lot to consider in that question. Marvin is a mocha server (almost vanilla, some plugins), and I try to keep it that way.

-----


**Your server is a commitment to your players and its experience.** People want to feel like they belong somewhere when they play on a server--after all, establishing, building, etc. is worthless when everything gets wiped constantly. I don't know anyone who likes a server that has a world reset every month, or a server that they find and a week later shuts down. If you're running a server and you intend for it to be a success, **commit** to it. Buy yourself a VPS. Learn how to administrate your server. Learn what plugins do what, and the extent of them--hell, learn how to *make* plugins if you so feel the desire.


**Make people feel like they belong.** For me, success doesn't mean tons of players coming in and out--it means players, no matter how many or how few, want to stay. You want your players to be able to look back and say, ""I had a great experience on that server, I'd love to play again tomorrow, or when I have time."" It's like brand loyalty. You want people to feel like they're a part, and own it.


**Humor your players.** A lot of players who are more creative will want to engage people in power, i.e., you, the moderator or administrator. Sometimes, people make awesome stuff and want other people to see it. It doesn't matter who, but usually, you're the most capable and most able of giving recognition of what your players have done. Believe it or not, this is **so important**. If your players feel ignored, then they'll ignore your server.


**Be around, be social, even if indirectly.** Certain players just like to be left alone and to their own devices--they find a server, they don't talk much, and they just build away. Yet, you'll find that even these players tend to log off if they're the only one on. People are social creatures, even the introverts, who may socialize indirectly. Just having people around is always good; it makes people feel like a server is alive, that there's actually a community there. After all, if you're not in it for the community in one way or another, then there's no point to playing multiplayer on Minecraft.


**Choose your moderators/admins wisely.** This is really important. I've heard tons of horror stories where people have been screwed over by asshole moderators or administrators and swear never to go back. Don't select anyone who's overly rude, rash, or even too eager to help. You want people who can speak intelligibly but don't say too much; people who show restraint and good taste in how and where they build, and how they interact with other players. You want people you can depend on and trust.


**Be accessible.** This is a huge one. You want your website (if you have one) to be direct and up front--not annoying to navigate, or figure out. You want players to be sucked in immediately so they actually get to your server. Then, once they're in, make sure your spawn is comprehensible. Don't force people to read hundreds of signs--your server is not that important. If we're going to act like a dick, we're probably not going to read your signs anyway. Highlight the important things, and if you have to explain a lot, space it out with interesting things to look at. A lot of players want to just get to somewhere to build. Don't hassle your players for no reason.


**Give people something to do.** Not everyone is entirely self-motivated, and I'll admit, a lot of the times being a server administrator is like being a brother, sister, babysitter, father, mother, and doting grandparent all at once depending on who you're interacting with. Sometimes you just need to give people ideas, help them work on things, let them into your world and feel involved and important. Don't give too much and never be lax about your own policies and rules, but giving people a push in the right direction helps individuals and promotes a great community spirit.


**Set rules and stand by them.** Don't bend your own rules. If anything, try to follow your own and play like part of the pack. While there's definitely an administrator/mod-player divide, try to minimize it as much as possible so players don't feel alienated. At the same time, if you set certain rules and they're broken, punish appropriately (but not excessively). Make it clear that players should respect your server, or they should leave. It's that simple.


**Be humble, and encourage your moderators to be humble.** Don't overplay your power as an administrator, and don't be excessive (though of course everyone should have a little fun with WorldEdit every now and then). If you allow your moderators access to any kind of special powers, make sure that they don't abuse them or show them off excessively. It doesn't do any good for the community at large.


**Ultimately, foster a caring community.** It's important to set up a community that respects itself and one another as they're playing Minecraft and having fun. Don't let people with bad attitudes stick around for long. You might even find yourself in the position to be a mentor to someone who looks up to you, or puts a lot of weight in your feedback. Remember my first tip: you have a commitment to your players if you're serious about running a server. So be good to them, and they'll probably be good to you.

Calmore is a multiplayer survival server quite different from most you might find, while there have been other servers like it (binarychaos.net for example) ours was more planned than those.

If you like to play in vanilla and you like survival then this server is perfect, build your empire and try to survive from not only monsters but other nations, cities and groups of mercenaries too!

This is kinda RP but you don't have to participate in any of that to play, I don't. If you just want to help build cities with friends or build an arena and host battles then so be it!

The most important thing is that we would like mature players, we don't want people mindlessly griefing however there are no rules against griefing (except in the spawn city which is a safe haven). You can also steal and kill. So you really do have to watch your back but playing in an atmosphere like this does require a level of maturity that other servers do not look for. This ensures a fun, friendly atmosphere for everyone playing.

SHUT UP AND LET ME PLAY: mc.midgardserver.net

Hello all!

Midgard is a survival server (24/7) with Bukkit and select mods.

We stay close to the vanilla playstyle while incorporating features that help the game feel fresh and user friendly.

The map is less than a week old so not much is explored.

We have a strict anti-cheat policy which is enforced by plugin NoCheat and an anti X-ray mod which obfuscates ores.

Activity is not huge, but stable. We regularly see 10-20 users on line during peak hours from all regions of the world.

We have a strong administration team who are on at varying hours, both inside and outside of peak. We're helpful and informative too - just ask :)

We also offer a PVP and Creative map, which are accessible in parallel to the survival mode.

We don't operate a whitelist policy, and we have ungriefing tools. Regular players operate on a three strike policy before a ban is issued, but generally we're pretty lenient. New players who seem to break rules quickly (griefing, harassing, etc.) are dealt with equally quickly.

Also we have a website (linked above), with forums, a new shiny teamspeak server and a very high uptime.

Please feel free to check out the website (the commands and features is ever so slightly out of date - in-game has them all, though) and post any questions you might have here.

We look forward to having you!

P.S. When you inevitably have a good time on this server, please consider coming back here to upvote so that we can benefit even more from the wonderful Reddit community which has been an inspiration to us to continue to offer the server :)!

Our economy system is well thought out and maintained by our admin staff. We highly recommend that you visit our subreddit, found at [www.reddit.com/r/theoldshillelagh](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheOldShillelagh). There you can find the server rules or information on how the economy system is set up. **If you are interested in joining this server, please post your MC name and we can add you to the whitelist.** Also, it wouldn't hurt to frontpage the subreddit, as that is where any future announcements will be posted.

**Worlds:**

[*The Old Shillelagh*](http://i.imgur.com/hFjdw.jpg)

Our PvE map. There is no greifing allowed here, and we have measures in place to repair or replace any griefing that is done(Griefer's will be found and banned). There are also no creeper explosions on this map. We have recently moved to this new map when our old hosting service went under, so not much has been built up yet. We have a few redstone geniuses on the server that have set up a fully functioning minecart station that can send you from spawn out to 1k in any direction. There are also many cities springing up across the map. We have recently made a cartograph of this world that can be found [here](http://i.imgur.com/JFlpR.jpg). 

 
[*The Dark Shillelagh*](http://i.imgur.com/O13FB.jpg)

Our brand new PvP map where anything goes. This map is a recreation of The Old Shillelagh, but with a much darker touch. You can get to this map through a portal at spawn. Griefing, stealing, killing, and traps are allowed on this map, however, there will be zero tolerance for this in The Old Shillelagh so pay attention to what world your in!

Owner of MCNSA.com here inviting you in.  We are fairly well known among the reddit community, have a very active [subreddit](http://mcnsa.reddit.com), and would love to have some more quality people.  Our main rule is don't be a douche, which encompasses quite a lot of things.

Server Specs:

* 50 mbs up/down connection
* 16 gigs of ram
* Writes to an SSD

We can run 60+ people just fine.  At the time of writing this there are 40 online and there is zero lag.  This is a survival server and you are expected to survive.  The server runs nocheat, so don't expect to fly, along with a host of bukkit plugins to streamline your experience.  We have also recently implemented MCNSA chat, which is a customized chat plugin which allows you to mute any user you don't care to be bothered by (as well as much much more).

The server is well moderated, with a staff of around 21 Saints and Templars (these are our mods).  We will protect structures upon request and *griefing is not tolerated*.

Come visit us, if you act like a douche you will be banned.  If you're not a complete buzz kill then you will find you might have a new home.  

We look forward to seeing you!

We are a 100% no nonsense Minecraft server. Completely vanilla except for anti-grief/cheat and some warps are set up to alleviate the longer walking distances. We are moderated 24/7 with highly manipulable rollbacks installed to ensure there won't be any long-lasting damage caused by griefing. Our moderator team won't hesitate to kick or ban at the slightest sign of bullshit or douchebaggery.

Server Specs:

* 16GB DDR3 RAM
* 3.2 GHz 6 core processor
* 64GB SSD
* 1TB Western Digital HDD

We are hosted at the [Nexcess](http://www.nexcess.net/) data center in Dearborn, Michigan with a 1Gbps connection to the Internet. Our server can handle quite the load, so no need to worry about lag. Theoretically, we can support well over 120 players, but until Minecraft's multi-core support improves our max is around 40-50 players playing simultaneously.

Here at NoBullcraft you start out as a [Drifter] and advance your way up to [Resident]. Residents are more respected, can use lava/TNT, and have the ability to lock chests. The best way to achieve this status is to play on the server, don't be a dick, and most importantly, don't ask to become one! New Residents are selected democratically by current residents, via a voting process held by one of our Mods or Admins.

Our server runs solely on donations, so we ask that if you enjoy playing then you at the very least consider showing us some support. We understand not everyone has the ability to do that, but we greatly appreciate all those that help keep us up and running! Our server will remain public for all to enjoy as long as we are able to pay our monthly fees. In-game, donators will receive a special custom tag of their choice, as well as super awesome protected plots of land...and we sure love donators &lt;3

Any further questions can be asked and answered either in-game, or here on this thread.

We look forward to seeing you online!

I've got a brand new private SMP server and I'd like to invite some redditors to play in it. I'm looking for a few mature players who want to be creative and build while not messing with any existing stuff. I'd love to do some large co-op builds or you can do whatever really.

The first few comments saying they want in will get in and if things go well I will invite more later.

EDIT2: There is supposed to be a client/server patch tomorrow. I will try to get the server back online ASAP as my time (and minecraft.net) permit.

Since we had quite a bit of griefing our first night up, we have enabled the whitelist.  Rj usually takes it down while he is on, but if you want on the server and the whitelist is enabled, just pm him and he'll be happy to add you to it.

After approved they can flag users as griefers, and must provide proof of this(aka server logs).  Regular users can create accounts to comment or flag these posts if there is inaccuracies, and can also appeal bans.

there would be a simple export feature for this as well to get a full list of griefers, and if any known griefer attempts to join your server you can always refer back to the information found on the list and make your own decision about this person.  Your export could also be customized so if You decide to let in a known griefer he wouldn't show up on a future export of the griefer list(to make your life easier and not have to constantly merge through the list and pull out names)

I was also thinking of different types of bans, so you can ban actual griefers, or just dupers(if your server tries to be vanilla), people who act rude constantly or whatever.  then admins could filter this list based on the type of bans you want to uphold

**THE SERVER**

-24/7 Server

-Player limit: 12

-Player ranks based on trustworthiness (Peon, Default, VIP, Mod, Super Mod, Admin)

-Kits (Deluxe sets for VIPs)

-Monsters are turned OFF until health is serverside. No point in wasting CPU cycles on something that doesn't work. (you can still see them in dungeons though)

-There is a 32 unit protection radius on the spawn zone. Nobody but Super Mods/Admins can build here.

RULES:

-Obviously, no griefing. This will result in being permanently banned.

-Build your buildings at a decent distance from other buildings, no building-crowding. Failure to do this will result in having your building torn down by a mod or admin.

-TNT is for use by VIPs and above only. If you need something blown up ask a Mod/Supermod.

-Asking for VIP or modship automatically disqualifies you for it.

-Backsass to mods is allowed, so long as it's justified.

-No water or lava structures. This makes the server laggy.

We are running a Minecraft Server, Seppe Universe. We have installed a whitelist to keep griefers from attacking our server overnight. We are still looking for more people to join our server. We aim to be a survival server and we do not use mods that influence gameplay, just a few to protect us from griefers. We have a mumble server too, so we are able to use voice-chat :) 
You're not obligated to use the Mumble (a lot of people don't), but feel free to hang with us over there too.

* **Rules**:
We don't have a clear rule-list. It's important you respect our number one rule; just be kind to eachother. Have some common courtesy, be a little mature and don't kill eachother or edit/remove buildings you didn't build without the player's permission.
Deliberate griefing results into an instant ban.

* **Server Hardware**:
The hosting is done by http://offensiveservers.nl/, we've got 3gb of dedicated ram, the server is ran on a SSD.
* **Plugins**:
Just a few for protection. Normal players should have a 100% Vanilla experience.
This is a Semi-Vanilla survival server, so there will be no small enchantment plugins like Essentials. *That is Final!*

We've got the following people as Admin:

* **Description**: 

The Server is running http://feed-the-beast.com/ with the MindCrack v7 modpack. PvP is enabled by default, the server is set on hard difficulty with default biomes.

Our admins have a background in information technology and are working on our own plugins/continued integration of Bukkit plugins into Forge.

Currently there are 3 possible ranks on the server:

1. default(you start in this group)
2. user(after 1d of playtime)
3. advanced(after 4d of playtime)
4. trusted(after 16d of playtime)

Higher ranks allow you to claim more and bigger residences(use /res limits to check).


How to claim your own area:

1. Get a wooden axe
2. Select a cuboid by left clicking on one end of your claim and right clicking on the other
3. use //expand vert
4. /region define regionname yourname
(where areaname is the name of your area)

This is if you want to allow your friends as well:

4. /region addmember regionname playername



* **Rules**: Since playing with other people is fun it should never be your goal to ruin someone else's experience. PvP is allowed outside of residences(those are regarded safe-zones!), do not try to grief residences these are the only rules on our server.

The only way to protect your land, anything not in a town is susceptible to griefing.

- Start a town, become a mayor, lead your residents into a prosperous time of peace, or indeed send them to arms in an effort to secure more land.

Feeling brave? check out the mob arena, choose a class, and prepare for complete chaos as you battle wave after wave of monsters like an unrelenting storm. Go in with friends, work as a team, see who can survive the longest competing for bragging rights, whilst picking up prizes along the way.

Feeling creative? Several of our Mob Arena's were designed and built by the players, if you think you've got the talent, talk to an admin to make arrangements.

Feeling even more adventurous? Test your skills in the spleef and team death-match arenas. Winner takes all!

TottonCraft is a whitelisted server all about the **vanilla experience**. No freebies or game changing mods allowed on here! We also like to make grinders and other high-tech redstone devices. Occasionally we have events in the weekends e.g. hardcore matches.

We provide a place for adults to do and build whatever they please (within reason of course :P)

Our main focus is to build a great community of members who help each other out as well as build wonderful towns and monuments together.

We have been online 24/7 since July 2011 and we aren't planning on closing up shop any time soon, so do not worry about losing your creations!

Our detailed stats page tracks all of your actions in the server [\(example\)](http://www.tottoncraft.com/player-statistics/?player=S74Rshaped) and our [Live Map](http://map.tottoncraft.com/) shows you where you are at all times

As said, the server is vanilla with specific plugins to ensure that no griefing occurs.
So, how can you sign up? Check out our [website](http://www.tottoncraft.com) and hop on over to the 'Apply' page.

* **Description**: A simple vanilla server for adults, 18+. I just started the server, and am looking for some nice mature people. Everything on the server will be 100% legit, for everybody, always. The server is set to hard difficulty. PvP is turned off. No plugins! Some anti-cheat plugins might be added in the future, if we have any problems, but there will never be any plugins that affect game-play in anyway. I'm looking for people who are going to stick around, and build a nice tight-knit community.
    The map is randomly generated and fresh, with basically nothing. New players can help build spawn, or go out and do their own thing! This server is Whitelisted! If you would like to apply, please use the format below and message me, or post below. I'm looking for 15 or so people. Thank you!

* **Rules**: 
    Be nice. This is obvious. Nobody likes a jerk.
    No cheating. No mods/hacks/cheats whatever. No flying/x-hay or anything of the sort. Cheating results in a ban, foreverz!
    No stealing! Don't take anything without getting permission to do so.
    No griefing! Don't bother people's things. That's rude. Don't be rude.
    Be active! Anybody who doesn't log on for 2 weeks time will be unwhitelisted. (Unless they notify me of an absence.)

* **Description**: You start alone in a random location in this 9000x9000 world. Difficulty has been set to hard, so you better make sure you don't get too hungry and die from starvation, or you'll respawn in another random location. The only way to stop the random respawn is to make a bed and sleep in it. Oh, you also might want to keep your things hidden, as griefing is allowed at all times, in all locations. As long as lava and water sources blocks are picked up after the griefing is over, you're 100% okay to grief. 

We recommend joining with friends or meeting up with other users on the server. There is no ""Factions"" plugin, but groups have formed on their own. The threat of betrayal is always there. It's up to you who to trust.

If you can't hear anyone, it's because you aren't within 100 blocks of them.

Hope to see you soon! Good luck!

Today's topic is the controversial topic of how to format your post's title. 

Last week you voted that we are going to ban the use of nonstandard ASCII characters, in my opinion this means that you cannot use anything but letters and numbers and the ""[ ]"" brackets. 

You also voted to allow the use of plugin tags, in my opinion this would cover massively game changing plugins (EX: McMMO) not NoLagg and the like. I want to talk about what sort of plugins should be allowed and what should not be allowed.

I would also like to talk about creating a standardized title format that we can use when the Standardized Posting Format becomes mandatory.

You can do this in anyway you please (except client hacking), and stealing, bribery, and assassinations are skills you will have to learn to escape and reach the top.


You must also align yourself with other players and factions in the world, as 2 sects of players are also fighting for the kings seat and only those at the top of each can become king. These Factions (Thieves and Military) have benefits and negatives to joining and so it is up to you to choose your allegiance wisely.


Gather players and therefore support as they pledge fealty to you in return for your protection, for monarchy is a popularity contest is it not?

What I'm looking for is cool people who want to get on, gather resources and build. On their own, or in group projects, I don't care. I have put in a whitelist to keep the douches out, and installed a handful of mods to keep the world safe and keep hackers out. Other than that and the essential commands, the world is vanilla.

If you love Minecraft, want to join a new server, survive and just BUILD, then hit me up with a PM. I'm going to make the server go live at 11:00 pm EST tonight, hopefully with a whitelist with a couple of people on it who can come and go as they please. If you guys would like to help me build spawn, that would be awesome as well, as I plan to make everything 100% legitimate without spawning materials (we'll see how that goes). :)

Also, because I have limited experience running a server, I'm completely open to suggestions. Hopefully the community that grows from this will be tight knit and trustworthy. Together we can make a great place to mine AND craft until the wee hours of the morning.

Currently my server has 16 slots. Here's to success!

**Servers Live! Let's hope this goes well.**

**67.166.244.120:25565**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

**UPDATE:** Wow, couple of hours in and we have a great little community! I think for the sake of my limited power server, and to limit the possibility of getting any griefers/hackers/assholes, I'm going to limit the whitelist at the moment to around 20 people. As of now we have about 15. Thanks everyone for making this a success!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
**UPDATE 2:** Well we have quite a bit of people on the whitelist now, so I'm going to be cutting applications off atm. Once people start disappearing we'll probably be looking for more. I'll definitely post when that happens, and if you sent a message and weren't able to get in try again next time you see!

After seeing a lot of servers that claim to be Vanilla (but end up having loads of plugins), I had gotten to my breaking point. I am looking to provide a simple, fun, and mature experience in Minecraft for all to enjoy.

There will be no plugins that alter the experience for players EVER installed. No McMMO, no iConomy, etc. The only plugin you need to worry about is LWC, which allows you to lock your chests, doors, and furnaces to prevent stealing. This is a friendly and calm server for all to enjoy.

We are a medium sized server where a player can build an city or an empire on his own accord. Or tear one down if suits his taste. We thrive on player confict and action, so this server isn't for the faint of heart. However, our admins are fair and strict rules guide their actions. No items may be spawned in for individual players. Instead any items distributed will be done in the form of our regular community events,in which players can earn glory or wealth. These events can range from simple quests, PvP Tournaments, team versus team brawls, and much much more. We listen to what our community has to say and seriously listen to their suggestions and concerns.

**Server Rules**

- Do not exploit glitches.
Common sense here, this means you're not allowed to exploit into an enemy factions base to try to snag sweet loots. 

- PvP is allowed.
If someone kills you don't get mad, get even.

- Griefing another faction is allowed, provided it does not violate rule 1.
You're allowed to destroy enemy factions bases, unclaimed griefed bases are subject to removal by admins. 

- Moderators and Admins are not allowed to aid players in a way that would give them an unfair advantage.
They will not teleport you to a new spot, or give you items, or treat you any differently than any other player.

- No Cheating.
This includes third party hacks and X-rays(both mods, texture packs, and minimaps that show ore locations.)

- We do not censor swears or other naughty words.
This doesn't mean that we allow constant hate speech or general bigotry, keep it off our server.

- Exercise common sense.
Just because we don't have it listed in these rules doesn't mean it's allowed, if you're unsure, ask an admin.

In the PVP world we allow griefing, creepers destroy buildings and lave + fire... guess you'll have to find out for yourself!

We also allow Factions in the new world! Become allies or fight as enemies to the death!

I hope to see you there!

There is no whitelist and everyone can build by default. We use WorldGuard(/region claim) and LWC to protect our stuff, so griefers shouldn't cause you any problems if you use the tools available to you.

*Community is over 1 year old.*

Welcome to Thunderdome bitch. Keep your head down and form alliances to survive life on the inside. Toil in the mines and stack your money secretly to earn new ranks with access to new cell blocks. Oh shit, guard saw your shank. Hand it over or kill his ass and run. New cell blocks contain more profitable mines and cooler features in general. As factions compete for dominance, deals are struck with guards who look the other way. Money exchanges hands silently and contraband floats undetected through the prison. There's also a rumor of an old forgotten escape route out of the prison but either no one knows where it is or they keep it to themselves. Will you try to find it? Or will you work hard and earn your way out of this death trap? The choices are yours to make and you get out what you put in. A light RP and imagination will definitely make it more fun but its not necessary to have a good time. Try thinking outside the box!

**Features**

Factions

Purchasable plots

Many ways to make money

You may apply to be a guard but you must follow the Warden's rules

**SERVER RULES**

1. Do not use client side mods (mini map mods are allowed)

2. Do not spam chat (use faction chat to keep spam to minimal)

3. Do not glitch out of the prison
If this happens let the warden know

4. Do NOT advertise other severs

**Prison Rules**

1. Do not attack other prisoners/guards.
This is a PVP server; PVP is not against server rules, But if a Guard sees this he/she will jail you or kill you

2. Never be in possession of contraband items.
If a Guard sees an item, he/she will ask for it 3 times, if you do not give it up, he/she can jail.


3. Do not camp the spawn, work areas, shops, etc.
This includes camping PVP borders and wait for people to leave, as well as attacking from Non-PVP.

4. If you kill a guard, that guard MUST forget what happened. But if you kill the same guard 3 times in a row consecutively the guard can jail you.

**Cell Blocks**

Inmate: The default rank in the prison, basic work stations are provided.

Convict: $25k

Vandal: $50k

Thief: $75k

Terrorist: $100k

Freedom: $145k

* PVP is ON
* Monsters are ON
* Difficulty is HARDCORE
* Deathban is 3 HOURS
* Map size is 10k by 10k

Once you're out of the spawn there is no going back and you will have to fight to survive. On death you are kicked out of the server and must wait 3 hours before you can come back. In terms of gameplay anything goes so be on your guard at all times. My only request is that you don't use exploits or hacked/modded clients to gain unfair advantage.

* **Survival** - PvP is enabled, but has [rules](http://diamondmine.net/rules) and is moderated. We do not give players items, as it's survival. Build wherever you want or join a city.
* **Ranks** - If you build great things, you're acknowledged for your work.
* **96 Slots** - Our server is hosted by [Akliz.net](http://www.akliz.net/), located in Boston. There is no lag, and we're always up (unless Bukkit says otherwise).
* **History** - Our community has been around since July of 2009, we know what we're doing, and [we do it well](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0jsVJZI8YI).
* **Plugins** - We have many plugins, several of which [are our own](https://github.com/laCour), all are meant to make your stay enjoyable. We do not have intrusive plugins (e.g. iConomy or Factions). We have a bartering economy, you can set up shops and trade items.
* **Creative world** - Not into survival? That's fine, we understand. We also have a creative world.

There is more to it than fighting though.

It's not much fun to join a server with a whole city on it already. I want a PVE survivor server that runs ALL THE TIME. Vanilla, no cheats/modz except for some anti-greifing possibly. Just so I can actually play WITH people. This is ridiculously hard to find. 
I have visited 8 servers now:

* 2 servers didn't work at all. Not sure why you advertise them on reddit if you don't have them going strong yet. I might log in, play for 20 minutes and then BOOP-dead.

* 3 servers only run ""when they feel like it"" so when the admin goes to bed, they shut down the whole server. God forbid I find some redstone before you do while you nap.

* 2 other severs have ""no cheats"" except for the admin/moderators who basically flaunt there giant-ass builds and summoned diamonds in front of your face while you play survival. This is the worst type of server. Played for 6 hours straight looking for diamond, found about 12. Then go to another player's house and see he has 6 sets of diamond armor in display chests? Not only is it irritating, but it basically makes me feel like I wasted every minute of playing.

* The final one even had really odd ""extras"" added in that the admin didn't tell anyone about. Such as creepers that blow up into diamond ore blocks

(nearly). No whitelist but you must apply to build! PVP only in arenas and certain regions.

We have a core group of regular dedicated players and friendly moderators.

Anti-Grief Measures:
* Personal regions - you can't be griefed if your house is protected
* Rollback - Didn't setup a region?  That's ok, we can still rollback the damage.
* Bans - We have near zero tolerance for griefing.

I plan for the server to be around for a long time but if you build something that you really like you can take it home with you. When updates call for terrain regeneration, structures are imported by request so you don't have to worry about losing that home you spent hours working on.

We are a 100% no nonsense Minecraft server. Mostly vanilla except for anti-grief/cheat and some warps are set up to alleviate the longer walking distances. We are moderated 24/7 with highly manipulable rollbacks installed to ensure there won't be any long-lasting damage caused by griefing. Our moderation team won't hesitate to kick or ban at the slightest sign of bullshit or douchebaggery.

Server Specs:

* 16GB DDR3 RAM
* 3.2 GHz 6 core processor
* 64GB SSD
* 1TB Western Digital HDD

We are hosted at the [Nexcess](http://www.nexcess.net/) data center in Dearborn, Michigan with a 1Gbps connection to the Internet. Our server can handle quite the load, so no need to worry about lag. Theoretically, we can support well over 120 players, but until Minecraft's multi-core support improves our max caps out well before that.

Here at NoBullcraft you start out as a [Drifter] and advance your way up to [Resident]. Residents are more respected, can use lava/TNT, and have the ability to lock chests. The best way to achieve this status is to play on the server, don't be a dick, and most importantly, don't ask to become one! New Residents are selected democratically by current residents, via a voting process held by one of our Mods or Admins.

Our server runs solely on donations, so we ask that if you enjoy playing then you at the very least consider showing us some support. We understand not everyone has the ability to do that, but we greatly appreciate all those that help keep us up and running! Our server will remain public for all to enjoy as long as we are able to pay our monthly fees. In-game, donators will receive a special custom tag of their choice, as well as super awesome protected plots of land...and we sure love donators &lt;3

Any further questions can be asked and answered either in-game, or here on this thread.

We look forward to seeing you online!

100% legit play includes NoCheat, AntiHack, and AntiXray.
Non-administration related plugins:

Death and Rebirth - When you die, you have to find a shrine and type /rebirth to come back to life. Until then, you can't do anything.

Dreamland - When you sleep in a bed, you go to the Skylands.

iConomy - Money system.

Jail - Jails bad players.

LevelCraft - Leveling system. You don't need any levels to use stone tools. You need level 5 in a skill to use the iron tool related to it, 10 for gold, and 20 for diamond.

Lockette - Chest and door locking system. If your stuff gets stolen due to your negligence in locking your stuff up, not my problem.

Supernatural Players - Allows you to be a ghoul, werewolf, vampire, priest, witchhunter, and demons.
     To be a vampire, place a gold block and put at least 20 obsidian blocks within a 7 block radius of it. Then right click the gold block.
     To be a werewolf, get killed by a dog at night. You'll have a small chance of coming back as a werewolf.
     If you donate valuables to the church donation chest, you will automatically become a priest.
     If you kill three different types of supernatural players without dying, you will become a witch hunter.
     If you enter the Nether in full leather armor and kill yourself in lava, you'll become a demon.

**MineGaiden - Now Serving 1.6.6**

After months of work and moving from host to host we're finally ready to open our server to the Minecraft community! Join us for when we kick off our PvP events in the next couple weeks and help get our (rather open-ended) economy rolling! The more people that become regular Miners, the more features will be added over time. MineGaiden is hosted for you, the community!

**Server Location:** New Jersey, US

**Address:** minegaiden.servegame.com

*Mumble coming soon*

**Why MineGaiden?**
Our world is as open-ended as you want it to be. Our economy, cities, and PvP events are all optional features so if you want to live in the wilderness you can! As long as it's not protected by WorldGuard, or doesn't involve knocking out our transit system, it's open season!

**So wtf do I do now that I'm in here?**
All new players start in ""Peasantville,"" a multi-chunk section that is surrounded by lava. We use this as our ""whitelist"" to filter out undesirable players. Escaping from Peasantville will get you banned instantly, but this is to protect the rest of the world and to test your maturity level. Show us that you're an active, all-around good Miner and you'll be invited to join on of our growing cities. Start by building and gathering tools and weapons.. you'll never know when a Hit Squad might roll through Peasantville. [Click here](http://minegaiden.forumotion.com/t14-minegaiden-this-is-how-it-works) to read more about how we work.

**Open-ended economy?**
Yep, You can make money however you wish. Start a Mining operation and sell your goods to other Miners or even the cities, create a mob grinder and supply your city will arrows, etc. etc. etc. We have Market zones in each city for you to post your [Trade] signs so there's always a central location for you to find the wares you need. We'll even pay you for helping us build up our infrastructure. 

**What kind of PvP events are you running?**
We have an arena setup with more on the way including a multichunk-sized ""world PvP"" section. PvP is always enabled outside of protection zones however, including friendly-fire. Spleef is also in the works.

**Do you require donations?**
Never. I felt asking money for access to /kit and a couple cheesy commands was just that, cheesy. People who take the step to help keep MineGaiden alive are rewarded with ""Lord"" status. This gives you full access to plugins, weekly bonuses to your /balance in-game, and build rights on our Creative world. While this isn't a monthly requirement the more often you donate the more you secure your Lord status.

Hacks = Ban 

Not only does it give you an unfair advantage when it is essential to live far away from spawn and hide but it also degrades server performance for all other players.

Bananas started off as a private server for a couple of my friends and myself, but we got lonely so I opened our doors to reddit. Needless to say, we made quite a few new friends and our community has grown to the point where I can no longer host the server from my home computer. 

So what does switching to a VPS mean? It means the server will have much less lag, it can support many more users, and will be up 99.9% 24/7 not including updates and such. I have increased the max slots to 30 as well. A world map with the google maps interface will be set up at http://bananas.stith.me/ over the course of the next couple days too.

Be sure to check [/r/BananasMC](http://reddit.com/r/bananasmc) for updates on the server, we use this as the server forum as well.

I hope to see you guys in game!

We have installed hey0's mod to deal with fire/TNT problems, and do allow kits (mining and crafting). We no longer expect frequent map restarts (except when absolutely necessary). On top of that, we have active admins.

We have no real rules, aside from the common sense (do not be a dick and tear people's stuff down, we're all just trying to have fun) and you're all more than welcome to join and begin building.

I'm going to run a server for about 48 hours to test system resource usage.  You're all invited to log in and create whatever you want.  There's a 20 user limit on the server and it's first come first serve.

Keep in mind that there's still some issues with authentication on Minecraft's servers, so if you get the ""took too long to log in"" message, this is because Notch's poor webservers are getting beat up.  Keep trying and you'll get in eventually.

Server address is: ypass.net

**edit:** 24 hours of admin experience later, and here's my observations

* Within a few hours someone will have burned every tree anywhere near spawn point, making wood almost impossible to find.
* If you find the 1x1 pointless pillars to the sky annoying, you'll end up going around and cleaning them up after people (I've gotten quite skilled at this).
* The official minecraft server is very buggy.  Various things cause severe lag.  The server I'm running this on is a dual Xeon 2.33GHz machine and I gave the server 1G of memory.  It is connected to the Internet via 100Mbit Ethernet.  The server hardware and network connection are not overloaded... this is a problem in the software.  Tomorrow night when I shut down this test, I'll mess around with a 3rd party server.
* Running a completely open server is probably a bad idea unless you're a masochist.  Random people will come in and just fuck shit up.  This leads to a lot of complaining.

1. Use common sense. If you think that what you're about to do could possibly get you kicked/banned, it probably will.

A little note on griefing:

If you grief, you WILL be IPbanned. I do not tolerate griefers at all. Same goes for those using hacked clients. There is nothing I hate more than griefers. I will show no remorse.

Griefers will also have their griefs rolled back. I can do it just by typing one string.

Griefers that get banned with also have another ban on a mcbans.

Tekkit updates with vanilla Minecraft (albeit with a little time in between to allow mods to be compatible).

There are also many additional mods that are not included in the Tekkit pack that the staff has installed on the server. LWC, Chestshop, Towny, and more! Additionally the Owner of SGTekkit is a member of the Technic Development Team! Come check out SGTekkit!

When you join the server for the first time you will spawn somewhere within a 5000 block radius. The spawns are random for everybody. There is no set spawn point. If you die you will respawn randomly unless you have created a bed.

The experiment is to see how fast people can find eachother and create a town. Here's the twist: you cant talk to other people unless you are 200 blocks away. So in order to be found you will need to create signs of your existance; statues, houses, or stick a sign on a tree that says ""Notch waz here.""

The only game changing plugins this server uses are LocalChat, Random Spawn, and World Border keeping the server as close to a vanilla single player experience as possible. You will be able to steal, grief, and make traps to kill others, as well as work together to build cities and monuments. Because of average minecraft server lag, I will not enable pvp. You will just need to find more creative ways to kill each other. There will be no spawning of any item in the server, not even by owner or admin. Everything in the server must be made.

My server was started in alpha, always with the goal of keeping notch's original SMP, with commands like /home and /spawn, but also making it as similar to single player as possible. We've always been a small server, 20 or so slots, and people come and go, but we've always had regulars who were on all the time and who we trusted completely.

So, about 2 months ago, my younger brother (and co-admin) wanted to switch our server over to tekkit, I was initially against it, but decided to let him try it. About a week it, we gained a whole bunch of new players, all interested in tekkit, while our older players and regulars decided they didn't like it, and wanted the old server and map back. I jumped on board with them, while my brother sided with the new people, and thus a civil war ensued. The aftermath was that our server stayed tekkit, our regulars quit, and the news guys got as rich and powerful as is possible in tekkit and got bored, and began stealing and griefing other less rich people. My brother got bored too, and started playing on capture the flag and Hunger Games servers, but refused to let me change the server back, after another few weeks, I finally was able to change the server back, and we immediately gained back some of our older players, and newer players who were tired of tekkit. Everything was fine, and everyone wsa happy, but then people started disappearing, until what was 10 players on at all times was 1. I went through the server logs and learned that while I was gone, one of our best players (let's call him aero) had been poaching our players away to another server. I felt betrayed, and banned him for breaking one of our biggest server rules (no poaching- advertising for other servers). 

Now, our old players have found another server, our new players have all quit to do other things, and the tekkit elite spend all day bothering me to change to tekkit, which is as far from what I want as possible. 

So, reddit, can you do me a solid, and check out my server? If you don't like it, then you can go. But I want life to return to my server, it's a fantastic world full of incredible work by myself and our players,  and the remaining 3-4 people are extremely nice. We cater to all players, old school alpha and indef/indev guys, all the way to late beta and minecraft 1.0 players.

The server has been up for over a month - although we have few members, we're all very friendly and helpful.
It is EST with the most members online being four out of a 20-slot (but a total of around 8 visit, over half are new to Minecraft) due to their work schedules, so we're really hoping to make a more active community.
At least one of the admins is British and they're on a bit, so if you're on a different timezone you won't be alone.

* There is no age limit but we do expect members to be mature and respect one another.
* We have a 'no bullshit' policy: we can't be bothered for those who cheat in Minecraft, use hacks, Godmode, X-ray etc. 
Simply enough you will be banned if found using them.
* We *do not* give out Creative-spawned freebies to anybody.
* Plug-ins are currently in-use, but they are never the game-changing ones as we have Economy, ColorSigns.
* Anti-grief plug-ins and permissions are on, and **the server constantly saves and backs itself up so we can rollback should something happen.** We have surprise teleport visits and we constantly check inventory :) Big Brother is watching you.
* Stealing from your neighbour's chest is *very* frowned upon! We look for a family-like community, so please ask us if you need help for materials before taking anything that doesn't belong to you!

The server is **whitelisted** so please post or PM me your Minecraft username to be added.

The goal is to rise from just getting out of jail, to back in your seat as the biggest drug manufacturer on the boardwalk. You will have to buy supplies, an apartment, and of course weaponry to protect yourself from other blood-thirsty drug dealers looking for a quick buck. You can start out by growing some ""reed"" (Sugarcane) to sell illegally. DON'T let the cops (admins) see you with it, though. We also have the Weed plugin installed so if you throw ""reed"" in a fire, you go under the effects of that psychedelic drug. Now, once you make a living selling reed you can move to bigger and better things. Buy a brewing stand and start making the big bucks on potions. Lastly, when you tire of toiling over a brewing stand, you can start producing golden apples for immense profit.

The map has cool hidden passageways to explore, tons of materials to buy, lots of things to keep you busy, and some funny hippie shelters.

It's been around a few months now and is at the moment just a small group of uni students from Sydney, Australia. The server is survival only, with a few non-game changing plugins that change over time, such as door locks etc... The server map is quite populated with a lot of little settlements from many players, and through our website we organise to build group structures together and other projects... and the occasional slaying of an Ender Dragon.
We are still an extremely new server, we are only just opening our community to others, so the player base is quite small, but very frequent and loyal. The server size will increase based on demand, so if our loyal player base expands, so will the server. So please come and check us out.

Just another note, our spawn area is not very populated with buildings because we all stray from the spawn to build our own projects. There is a railway at the spawn with mine carts into the centre of the area where most of us are building, please use that to get to us; or feel free to build at your own will anywhere.

Our server is Whitelisted, so to join you must have permission to log on.

For Example, we have an armor mod that give special permanent states while you wear that item. Diamond boots prevent fall damge (for use with our Jumppad mod), leather makes you run fast, iron gives XP while you walk, Gold lets you walk on water, etc. We have a jumppad mod that allows anyone to make a pressure plate into a jumppad. When paired with the diamond boots, it's a perfect way to get to the top of a tall building. We also have many other mods that help create a minecraft experience that's different from the others out there and we have a big, friendly community and dedicated staff that keeps everything safe and sound. Come try us out. http://www.mcquintarra.com Click the Join Us button after looking around at our site a bit if you want. We use Ventrillo (optional). 1.2.5.

A Friendly server for everyone!,7,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/sgkvb/smp_no_whitelist_moonnet_a_friendly_server_for/,"Moonnet is a continuously changing and up to date server. Everyone is very friendly and welcomes new players with open arms! Personally I've played on the server since it began and it has grown tremendously. We have a beautiful spawn center complete with tutorials, portals, and a working Server-Player and Player-Player economy! However we do have rules.

-Note: Spawn is currently being worked on. Don't be a dick and tell us whats wrong. We know.
Disclaimer: These rules are subject to change.

* NO GRIEFING. We have several anti-griefing plugins in place but some assholes love to find ways around. GRIEFING IS IN INSTANT BAN, AND WE HAVE PLUGINS THAT ALERT STAFF OF ANY GREIFING TOOLS USED. (Ex: Bedrock, lava, etc.)

* NO HACKING. HurrDurr. Isn't this every server's rule?

* DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE. We don't regulate this rule quite as much as some of us would like, but still. We want a friendly community to keep up a good reputation. BE NICE.

* DON'T ASK FOR OP OR HIGHER RANK. You won't get it. Stop spamming our chat. Which brings me to the next rule...

* NO SPAMMING. This also goes along with don't be an asshole. Spamming our chat IS A BAN-ABLE OFFENSE. WE don't want to be too mean so you will likley get muted first. Just saying. THAT ALSO INCLUDES NO CAPS.

* NO FLYING. Most servers have this rule too. Its basically a sign saying ""hey mods! Ban me please!"". Don't do it. 

**Know your staff! We are here to help you and are pretty nice.**

1332337657.0,6,self.mcservers,r6ppm,Hey Reddit; I'm looking for volunteers :3,10,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/r6ppm/hey_reddit_im_looking_for_volunteers_3/,"Ohai Redditors. Let me first say that I humbly apologize if this is frowned upon here, as I don't usually frequent this subreddit.

I've been working on a server concept for a little while with a few people. The basic idea is that there are four factions, each pitted against each other. We have a top-tier programmer called Nijikokun working with us, who, as you may or may not know, is the developer behind iConomy and Permissions (shameless namedrop; ACTIVATE!). Together, he and the rest of my team are going to be building an RPG-style server that focuses on quality gameplay and teamwork.

What I am looking for Redditors, is a few good old chaps to come work with us. You'll be working as or under one or two managers of each team, depending on what your skills are. Right now, we're in early development, so we're working on a lot of stuff I'm really not ready to talk about (which seems like a tease, I know), but we're looking for a few of everything.

I need extra programmers who can write clean and well documented code. You will be working with Nijikokun to create a gameplay experience that feels true to the idea of a minecraft RPG. There will be no cheesy ""use eggs to cast spells"" sort of work here. Everything will integrate into the game seamlessly.

I need a one or two people who are very knowledgeable about game design, balance, and generally understand what makes a game fun. You'll be working with myself to build a world inside what I like to think as the Minecraft ""engine"" that is fun for both hardcore and newbie alike, and that gives a real feel of progression and investment in a character.

Lastly, I need about five or so people who are extremely talented at creating both terrain and structures that don't seem over the top, unrealistic, or generally gross-looking (I'm looking at you diamond blocks). You'll be handling the world as a whole, shaping it to look fantastic but realistic, so that we can do what terrain generators cannot, usually working together on one or two large projects at a time.

Normally I'd buy you a drink or two before trying to get into your pants my dear Redditors, but it is what it is. I promise you that even though other servers may have similar projects going on, we're going to blow them out of the water with the quality we're trying to achieve here. If you're interested or even simply curious, just send me a PM. I'm perfectly happy to answer any amount of PM's to satisfy everyone's curiosity. You know, if there is any.

Finally, if you think you have a talent applicable to a project like this that I haven't listed (like working well as a community manager or server admins), I'm very receptive to anything like that! Just drop me a line, and maybe we can have a nice sit-down candlelight dinner or something. And maybe we can make out or something afterwards. Who knows?

Edit: I feel like I should mention somewhere in here that we have a very international team, so people of all timezones are welcome! In fact, I prefer it, so they we can have people functioning at all hours of the day. 

Edit #2: Thanks for all the responses! People seem to like PM a lot more than reply, but I don't mind one bit! Keep them coming guys, I've gotten a few gems already!",,False,self,t5_2s3kg,True,,,True,t3_r6ppm,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/r6ppm/hey_reddit_im_looking_for_volunteers_3/,

Clans

Many other servers use towns or factions. Clans are completely different. We are a PvP server, and you shall not have free acess to protection of land and PvP. You will not be scared and flee to your protected, pvp disabled land. You will most likely get killed in this server. But that's the enjoyable part in this server. Get killed once, get revenge! Become rivals, just remember that this isn't just kill people for the hell of it.

Heroes

Warcraft doesnt run the popular McMmo for many reasons. I will not explain all these reasons as of now, but I will tell you that Heroes is a better match for a PvP server, as it lets players have their own ups and downs. Everyone one of our heroes have their own unique abilities. We currently have

Woodsman

Warrior

Mage

Mender


As primary classes. Each of them can only wear specific armor and weapons. Each have their own skills. Every one of these are unique in their own way. More information on the skills, armor, and weapon limitations here.

5. Do not ask admins/mods for materials, items, perms, etc.

6. Listen to admins, don't argue with them.


Protections

We use a special plugin that will allow you to protect your land. With a cost. No, not cost in currency. We are talking about cost in items. Yes, we will use items, ores, Bar-blocks(diamond block, iron block) and special blocks to protect your land, or do special effects for yourself.

-There are very few ores here. Particularly, there is a lack of stone on the map. Stone can be found in veins like any other ore. You may find that you actually have to use wood tools to start.

This means **no plugins or modifications** and **no whitelist**  



Server Address: game.8bitrift.com

Server Forums: [http://www.8bitrift.com](http://www.8bitrift.com)

If you're looking for the real Minecraft multiplayer experience, and not some watered down ""lets play house"" server then look no further. I was tired of playing on servers that restricted how far I could explore, where I could build, *what* I could build, and what blocks I could use, so I created my own.  



**Explore as far as you want!** Some of our players have traveled out to 200k blocks from spawn, and *farther*.

**Use ALL the blocks!** Fire, tnt, lava... there are no restrictions here.

**Kill ALL the mobs!** All passive and hostile mobs, including wolves and village npcs, and yes creepers explode.

**Always the newest version!** Never have to wait weeks after a new version comes out waiting for Bukkit devs to play catch-up.

**Limited op moderation** Our rules are designed to let you do what you want without being hassled by overbearing ops trying to use you as a play toy.

**Persistent World** The world was reset for the 1.0 release but we will never again reset the entire world. The marks you leave on this server will still be here one year from now. The only exception to this is that a small radius around spawn may be periodically reset if Mojang introduces radical changes to the world generator (such as new biomes).  


This is **not a chaos server**, so there are some **rules**:
No griefing, No spamming, No racial slurs, No cheating/hacking, No flying,  No douchebaggery, No justinbiebery.

Because there are no plugins to help thwart griefing there is a high chance that anything built near spawn will eventually become griefed. Our players are encouraged to explore out into the world and build as far from spawn as they are comfortable with. The minimum recommended distance is 3k, but players are encouraged to go to 10k to decrease their chance of being found by greifers.

8-Bit Rift has been around since March 2011 and has been pure vanilla the whole time.

You may not know this yet but we are going to get along swimmingly.  I'm the owner of mcnsa.com.  We are one of reddits larger servers, but we have a super tight knit community.  We are SMP running off a server with 16 gigs of ram, a 50 MBs connection, SSD, and an Intel i7 to keep things lag free.  We have a robust rank system, several custom plugins as well as a great staff and great member base.

Our subreddit is /r/mcnsa and we grow in spurts.  If you check the top servers of all time on this subreddit you will see us listed a couple of times.  Technically we are an 18+ server - and age is determined by attitude.  Act like a child and you will be treated like one.  There is always staff online willing to help and you should be greeted with open arms.

Lastly, our spawn is designed to prevent griefers as well as children.  There are a few challenges to work through, but it's nothing anyone with a head on their shoulders can't handle in a jiffy.  Please check us out, we would love to have you.

MCNSA.com is the IP - that's all you have to type.  We hope you join our family!

The world is backed up every 1.5 hours, so if you get griefed, the griefer will be banned and it is no problem to restore any damages. The world will not be reset for the forseeable future (all creations will stay where you put them) and the server is up 24/7 at all times possible.
So far this server has stayed small so there still LOADS of space to build stuff. There is free land literally 30 seconds away from the spawn in any direction. Yet there is still a lot of cool stuff around the world that has been built up, ready for you to explore. This server is very fast, so you can connect from all around the world without worrying about lag. For example, we have players from Holland, Japan, and Australia who do not have issues with lag. We currently have around 8 regulars across different timezones, and many more frequent visiters. 

We just set up a new spawn in 1.0 land, so this second spawn has freshly opened land all around it! Be the first to help build it up! Bring your architectural A-Game! :P

**Who We Are Looking For:** At this point we have a good base of all sorts of players, **so now we are looking for more Talented Builders, Awesome architects, or mature regulars.**  
Do you enjoy collecting all your materials on your own, and then building awesome things with your hard earned resources? Are you creative, mature, and love to make amazing structures that are functional and aesthetically pleasing? **If yes, then this is the right place for you, and you will be extremely welcome on our server!** This is a whitelisted server, so in order to join, you must first apply!

**HOW TO APPLY:** If you **want the address to access** our server, **comment and send me a private message** and i will reply to your pm with the IP.
**In the message to me**, briefly tell me your age, your minecraft username, what you will bring to our server, what country/timezone you are in, or any other additional info that you might want us to know for example some people like to send us albums of the builds they've made in the past. **If you don't Follow the instructions your application may be ignored.**

We even have an active [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/crabdancemc/) dedicated to everything related to our server, where our players can submit pictures or posts about their WIPs, finished builds, adventures, or other shenanigans. Our players our encouraged to post here and share ideas, which has turned out great for our community!


**Some basic info: This is a...**

* We run bukkit.

* Survival server, you can do whatever you like, build, mine, venture the nether, explore. Its up to you.

* We try to keep the server as Vanilla as possible. The experience you can expect is the same mechanics as singleplayer, but with more players and much more fun.

* No mods. we do use a few plugins tho, but they are for anti-griefing and only the admin and the moderators can access them.

* Nothing that gives you an unfair advantage over other players is allowed. for example flying, hacking, thieving, using your own mods etc.

* No item Spawning. This is a vanilla server, everything you get or make MUST be legit.

* Fire and TNT is enabled

* Pvp is turned on, but this is not necessarily PvP server. just because you can hit people doesn't mean people want to be hit. respect other people.

* Neutral/enemy mobs do spawn.

* You do not need permissions to build places. However, if someone else has built something, respect their area. do not alter their things without their permission.

* We have two Spawns. The original is in pre 1.7 generated land, and a second spawn located in fresh 1.0 generated terrain!

  [TottonCraft](http://www.tottoncraft.com/) is a survival server seeking ten new members to join today! We are a small community and intend to stay that way. At the moment we have about 10 active players, and now we are seeking 10 more to join us. We have members from North America, South America, and Europe, so your locality doesn't matter as long as you speak English!

We run a mumble server as well for voice and text chat. Moderators idle in the channel pretty much 24/7, and there is usually always someone to talk to.

TottonCraft is a community-oriented server. We are always happy to help you with projects and builds. Check out our [forum](http://forum.tottoncraft.com/) and our [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/tottoncraft).

Everyone here is friendly, and we be happy to get you started and show you the basics once you join.

We run Bukkit, but try to keep the server as vanilla as possible. Here are some of the plugins we have installed

* DynMap - Check out our [Live Map!](http://46.105.112.53:8124/#)
* Lockette - For Chest Protection
* Multiverse - Since this server has been up for over a year, we have seen many changes in the terrain generator. Last week we installed this plugin and created a new world so we don't have any nasty chunk boundaries anymore. Access to the ""old"" world is just a portal away!

We are looking for players that meet the following:

* Must be mature. All of our players are over 16. Currently our average age is in the mid 20s.
* Willing to help on projects
* Friendly
* Optional: Prefers bacon as primary source of nutrition in Minecraft

* Hardmode is a different kind of survival pvp server. Players are spawned in a jail/dungeon area and they must escape it to reach freedom. Players can use whatever they can find in the dungeon to escape. Once the player escapes the dungeon its all fair game. Players can also place down beds to set their home or new spawn point.

Buildworx is a server that provides a fun and ultimately friendly environment that supports creativity and survival. You're welcome to build however you want to and play the game in your own way. Do you prefer mining to making houses? That's fine, go ahead and mine! You can sell your spoils to other players using iConomy if you want to, or you could build something interesting for the server to play in.

**What do I do first?**

Your first course of action is to check our rules and then head out into the wilderness! Craft your tools and once you find a suitable plot, build yourself a house. You could build underground if you want and make it so the interior is the key, but make it look good! Once a mod, admin or owner has approved this you'll be promoted to *Builder*, which gives you access to a few kits and more commands.

There are many different ranks you can achieve, some of which will come from loyalty to the server and how active you are/how much effort you put in, but others will have to be earned.

**Builder
Resident 
Citizen** 

Are the main ranks.

Then you can maybe go on to be **Citizen+** or **Steward**, both of which are only awarded to players by mods, not through applying on the forums like the rest of the ranks unless otherwise stated.

There's much more information on the forums and people on the server are willing to help at all times! There's usually people on at all hours as there are people from all over the world on the server.

**PvP**

Player vs Player IS on, but you aren't allowed to kill people while in their homes (which usually requires griefing to get into the home anyway due to our locking systems on doors) and no overkilling, which is killing people over and over for no reason.

If you believe somebody is harassing you for no reason then there is a place on the forums to report this.

**I've been griefed!**

Don't fret! We have a lot of anti griefing plugins so anything that has been griefed will not go unpunished as long as you report it within the first few days of griefing, as logs are only kept for so long. Your home will either be rolled back or fixed up by mods/admins/other helpers and the griefer will be punished with either a temp ban or a perma ban depending on the severity of griefage and if they've griefed before.

**Are there perks for donating?**

Yes. Donating gives you a lot of extra perks as donations are what keeps the server afloat! However, if these perks are abused or you grief, you don't get special treatment because you've donated. We won't let people pay to be dicks, basically.

**What can I do?**

Well, what do you like to do on Minecraft? If you want to build a town with a friend, sure! If you want to join somebody elses town, go ahead! It's completely up to you. 

**Please note, the server being 'creative' doesn't mean you get creative powers when you join. It means we support creativity and donators can choose whether they want to have creative or normal gamemodes (:**

",7,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/lb9ex/littledigplanet_a_pvpenabled_mostly_vanilla_smp/,"As the title here suggests, you're looking at a decent Vanilla Survival Multiplayer server.


Backstory &amp; Plans: A few months ago some real life friends and myself decided to start this strictly vanilla  server. We've been around for 6 months now, and we are not planning on going anywhere. With the release of 1.8, we started a brand new world, and are still playing on a relatively fresh map (Though the beginning island is becoming a little more crowded). We will continue playing on this map for the rest of Minecraft beta, but once the official release hits, we will most likely start fresh one last time. When 1.9 comes out, we'll have a single portal to new 1.9 content for everyone as well. For now, we are just looking to invite some new players, to get to know, and make friends with. New players, veteran players, doesn't matter.

-

Anywho, as the title of this post implies, this is a strictly Vanilla Survival 1.8.1 Multiplayer server. **No one on the server receives any sort of hand outs,** and there are no players who are higher 'ranks' than anyone else. No one can just pay their way to admin. We definitely keep the original feel for a vanilla style of play, and the only plugins we use are of protection purposes. This includes being able to set private regions of any player to protect it from any possible griefing, creeper/enderman protection, Lockette, ect.


We even have the /home and /spawn commands *disabled* on our server. We have had a few people complain about this, but once 1.8 came out, we felt that since they were really trying to push adventure and exploration that being able to teleport home, out of any situation, can really take away from the survival experience. So you'll really have to be careful not to get lost :)


As far as Admins go, there is only one account with the rank 'Operator' that myself and a couple other close real life friends of mine share to help moderate the server. It is really only used to set player regions for anyone who needs it. This privatizes a certain area so only that player (and whoever else he wants to have permission in the region) can build there.  Griefing is never a problem on our server, but it is always nice to have that peace of mind.

-

This is also a PvP-Enabled server, but **NOT a PvP-Oriented server.** There is a difference.  PvP is not the reason we play this game, and if you're looking to just go kill other players, and your only purpose is to be a nuisance, this is not the server for you. But, PvP is in no way regulated, so feel free to take a kill if you find it necessary, or even if you're just bored, though if it ever becomes a major problem, we'll likely end up having to regulate PvP in some way or form. 

That being said, the **beginning island is a PvP-disabled zone,** so you'll have 100% protection until you leave that area. You'll most likely be just fine once you leave the island, but if you upset someone for any reason, or you're killed by another player for any reason, there isn't any guarantee you'll receive the items you lost. **Admins will not spawn any items for players on the server.**

-

For the time being, there are no sort of 'age requirement' rules on our server, but please use common sense. We don't want any 5 year olds running around here being annoying. There are a few younger players on our server already, but as of yet, we've hardly had any problems with them. 

-

We have a number of players who frequent our server, but during mid-day at peak times, we'll often see around 8-10 players on, so we are by no means a huge server. We are mostly just friends who hang out and play minecraft. We also host a **Ventrilo** server as well for anyone who is playing, and you can find the vent info in the /rules once you hop in game.

-

Other miscellaneous facts:

* We play on 'Normal mode' (Starvation drains you to half a heart)

* 30 slot server

* No white-list; we keep it disabled so there are no issues when anyone wants to invite their friends. 

-

That is all I can think of to put here for now, but its a quick run down of how we play! If you think this server is what you're looking for, comment here, or send me a PM, and I'll shoot you a message with the server info. See you guys around!


**TL;DR**

* Strictly Vanilla SMP

* Minimal plugins; only used for protective reasons

* Been around 6 months; fresh map with 1.8

* 8-10 players online at peak times

* No player ranks; everyone is equal

* PvP-Enabled server, but NOT PvP-Oriented

* If you die and lose your items, their gone; no item respawns

* No age requirement rules to play; just don't act retarded

* Ventrilo server also available for us

We will be launching soon when a recommended build of bukkit is released for 1.8.1 (or 1.8.2 as the case may be) but in the meantime we have been designing our Kingdom based PvP world diligently.

To be clear: the server is not up yet but we are looking for some more players to join us when we re-launch. We are looking for mature players who enjoy RP and PvP. We are an international server with players from all over the US and Europe with a great community and lots of interaction between staff and players.

You can track our progress on our [forums](http://midgardrealm.net/forum/?action=forum) and take a look at the world which we have custom built on our [dynamic map](http://mc.midgardrealm.net:8123/#) with ultra high res mode. We also have a teamspeak server @ *talk.midgardrealm.net* that is usually active with the regulars, even in this period of downtime.

Our world is split into four Kingdoms (via the Towny plugin) that are governed by kings and a high council. Whilst we are primarily RP/PvP we do not make any demands of players to speak differently or act in RPMode, we just appreciate those who want something different and more fulfilling in a Minecraft server.

We also use the Heroes plugin for a class system with completely original and custom made Norse hero archetypes.

We have worked for 3 months now on this idea from design to implementation and so far it is looking great.

Just waiting on a RB of bukkit so our plugins can update and then we launch.

A handful of good builders and experienced admins need a place to roost.,6,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/k6qfa/our_server_is_dying_a_handful_of_good_builders/,"Our server's been running continuously since the halloween update, but due to some staff changes and a few retirements, we're probably gonna be closing down in a few weeks.  Most of our occasional players will probably just move on on their own, but we have a small cadre of about half a dozen who'd like to stick together, wherever we move next.  

We're good builders, great with redstone, and most of us are experienced admins (ie three of us are admins for over a year).  The ideal server is a bukkit survival mode (no give, but fly ok), preferably one that plans to reset after 1.8.  We like working on large scale projects like highways, and there's plenty of talent here.

As an added bonus, I prefer to do regular server maps, complete with labels, like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/Pcel0.gif) from a few months ago.  We also have a [forum](http://creativeminds.dyndns.org/forum/) and [classic server](http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=77d4700b8a2641a54eec8a664663fdef) that will continue to run, so we might even be able to work out a merging of some sort.

Maybe some of the people who have been offering their servers up will volunteer for this?

My idea is to have basically a server based off kinda /r/redditisland.  This was a project that started months ago but basically died because...well, because it's pretty unrealistic.  We'll have one giant island, and that is all that will exist on the map (maybe a few minor ones).  This terrain will be built exactly like an island in the real world, which includes ""actual size"".  For example, [Norman Island](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=norman+island&amp;hl=en&amp;t=h&amp;z=14) is about 4km long and about 1km wide.  This means 4000 blocks long and 1000 blocks wide.  This is a pretty large island, in terms of Minecraft.  It would also be sculpted very similarly with the same basic elevations, etc.  If we go with Norman Island (based off Treasure Island, btw) we can also use Flanagan Island as a sort of recluse island, where we can cast off griefers to based off a community vote.

The basic idea should be that we are starting our own island nation, and we can have votes about who will be the leaders, and so on.  Everyone can have their own job.  Maybe we can even dissolve into different warring tribes...however it plays out.  But it should be played without any mods and on survivor mode, so we're all in it together, and they point isn't to build giant marios but to create a island nation, with a city hall, expansive farms, an airfield, etc.  We can import the same ship from the mine craft republic and park it in the harbor.

Any thoughts?  I don't have a server, but maybe someone with a server would be able to volunteer theirs. They would probably have a built-in audience from /r/redditisland, at least.

**Rules**

* Griefing (altering someone else's property in any way without their permission) is a punishable offense, including server jail time, temporary bans, and permanent bans.

* Stealing from chests and furnaces are looked down upon, but not always banned.  The server uses Lockette, so there is no excuse not to lock your items.  Let this be your warning, lock your chests!

* PvP is active and welcome, however players that are not interested in combat may toggle pvp on and off.

* In game, dynamap, and forum spamming/trolling/fighting will be punished nearly as swiftly as griefing.  It is **not** welcomed in any form.  

* Utilize the easily accessible information resources available for Minecraft before harassing others.  If you need to know how to craft a bed, check the wiki, not your neighborhood admin.

* Lastly, use common sense in all things.  Just because a negative activity hasn't been listed on a rule list does not mean that activity will be welcome and unpunished.



**Server Specs**

* Dell PE2850 Dual Processor 3.0 Ghz

* 16gb RAM

* Raid 5

My server is a bit different and here and there I see the odd player very interested in our style. My first post relating to this server can be seen here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/hwycy/lets_create_civilization_law_and_an_empire_from/

And it is basically under the same premise. The server developed _very well_ and the community grew quite nicely. 


http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/i1sip/started_an_anarchy_server_after_4_days_unexpected/


And with some recent server changes I've decided to open the server  up for white-listing again!

The premise of my server as seen in the first link is very simple, the server is player run in a dark-ages theme with minimal admin-enforced rules. So far the server went from complete mayhem and anarchy to players creating their own factions and civilizations with laws and rules of their own. If all kind of snowballed and developed into some great political stuff on our forum.

Currently we're in the center of a very grassy biome, we have a BorderGuard set up with a 1000 block radius until 1.8 and we're focusing on a single city/civilization until then, at which point we'll open the border to generate tasty new 1.8 features!


tl;dr
- Light anarchy/RP.
- Minimal admin enforced rules.
- BorderGuard setup until 1.8 so we can keep what we build and expand with new terrain generated features in the future.

**Overview:**

Greysoul is a community of active Minecrafters who have ascended into a world of battle and intrigue. The player base frequently participates in daily raids, battles, and ambushes in the brutal exchange of power and land. Here you will find your countrymen among a number of Nations; including a highly-structured Kingdom, chaotic brotherhood of Viking warriors, and shrewd Merchants. With the recent update to the Factions plug-in, it is now a better time than ever to join in this world as the Empires begin to expand outward from their home territories to uncontested lands. How will you forge your legend in this world of power and devastation? Come fight for glory, or build your name atop a mountain of gold. Earn your titles as you slay the enemy, strike down on the Tyrannical King and his legions, if you dare; or drive back the Viking hordes and wild beasts of lore untold. Whatever side you choose, the battles will be fierce and the fun will be everlasting.

**Server Perk:**

Every server you have been a part of has died off, plugins are out of date, and/or your cool ideas falls upon deaf ears? No more! The Greysoul Admin and Moderators are in constant communication with the plugin developers, giving feedback, getting adjustments, and/or developing ENTIRELY new plugins. The 'Arrow-Limiter' plugin was developed as a Greysoul exclusive plugin, then later released to improve other servers. The well known plugin, mcMMO, which was developed by Nossr50, is one of the MAIN plugins on many RPG servers. Nossr50 and Server Admin, are in constant communication on how to better mcMMO. What this means to you is our server is the breeding ground for new idea's and improvements of one of the best RPG - Leveling plugins, your ideas, critique's and opinions are taken into account and put to good use. 

New plugins developed just for Greysoul are paid for by player donations to make this server better, for you the player. This will continue to be the way as the plugin developers listen to our feedback and tweak them to make our PVP experience one of balance and fun. As long as we have donations, you will have a server that is constantly changing for the better.

**New Classes!**

**Priest:** Love that feeling that YOU are the reason your teammates survived an ambush? That YOU and your buff on the swordsman are what caused a gank to go so well? Then look no further! The Priest could very well be the perfect class for you! Use your holy book to Heal, Buff, and Resurrect your teammates! 

**Mage:** 'A 7 inch wicker wand is all I need to make my maidens love me' With the mage class, unleash amazing area of effect spells, entomb your enemies within glass, and blink away from the brunt of the damage!

**Tamer:** Harness the power of nature itself, by taming and leveling up your very own Wolf! You can name this beast, if you so wish, and develop stronger bonds than glue itself. Fido will follow you into battle and loyally strike down any who have the audacity to oppose you. Unlike normal wolves, Fido will respawn after dying, with a short cooldown of course. Never feel lonely again, yet you are alone, so very, very alone...

##!NEW PLUGINS!##
***

**Arrow Limiter**

No more are the archers of this world, Legolas reborn, now each arrow has a delay on how fast it can be fired. Legolas fanbois QQ in their boots, while the melee classes rejoice. Fear not archers, with slower speed comes higher damage. Each arrow at its base has been increased to 3 hearts. Increase this even more if you join Orsana and choose Archery as  your weapon skill.

**HookShot** (Donors Only)

See a need, fill a need.. See a wall climb a wall? No more worrying about building pillars to climb walls or get out of caves. Our VIP's enjoy the newest technology including this amazing hookshot. Aim an Arrow, right click, then select string and right click, you will be yanked to the arrow. Use it to scale walls, Escape or chase down people in PVP. Go spelunking, shoot and zip anywhere your heart desires!

**Runecraft**

The Legendary SSP plugin ported over into SMP. Craft runes on the ground using Redstone, ore blocks and other materials, right click to activate, and voila. Useful and fun runes for the entire server to use. Examples being: Zeerix Chest, summon a chest to your location grab some items and then return that chest back to its orginal spot. Another? Well sure, Phantom Torch, a few simple redstone and a few torchs, creates a magic floating torch that follows you where ever you go, the duration is dependent on the Key Tier rune you use upon creation. These are just 2 examples of the many different runes you can cast!

**ItemCraft**

Itemcraft is a SMP port for SSP plugins. This AMAZING plugin allows SSP plugins like but not limited to, KSlopes, FancyPack, and Mo'Creatures to be ported over into SMP. Yes, thats right, I said Mo'Creatures on a SMP server. Before we get ahead of our selves I will explain the other 2 we have on our server.

* kSlopes: Allows for slanted blocks, angled blocks, and other amazing corner blocks to be placed, giving your creations a totally unique, and unblocky feel to them.

* FancyPack: FancyPack adds many new items and designs to the game. Chairs, tables, chains, decorations, hidden wall panels, and much more!

* Mo'Creatures: One of the most famous SSP plugins that spawns lions and tigers and bears, oh my! and various other woodland creatures, including tameable, rideable, and breedable horses (Horses are currently buggy in SMP)

Split up or face him together! Its a fight for  survival in this PvP-esque maze event. Compete to finish the maze before your  fellow victims.

Olympus) [survival],6,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/i7t03/spirestone_server_looking_for_volunteers_for_a/,"Ok here goes. SPirestone, my server, has been built upon, griefed, rebuilt, and expanded. I have established a small group of dedicated creative users, and was looking where to take the server, when a thought hit me.

Olympus. 

The Gods of Olympus were powerful, but with flaws, distinct personalities, and hidden agendas. Their manipulation of Man made for some epic stories that to this day inspire. I want to emulate that.

My plan is to create separate spawns for several tribes. They will be themed with various world aspects: Air, stone, water, for example. the gods will provide for their tribes, demand tribute, foster the tribes' growth, and of course, further their agenda. There will be possibilities for mortals to ascend to god status, and of course they can rebel against the gods, so long as they understand the possibility of retaliation. Griefing will be allowed only when within the confines of the experiment. you can build deadly traps, but not giant lava towers and blow up everybody's stuff for lulz.

If this is something you are interested in, let me know. Bear in mind this is an application. I want to know if you want to be aligned with the Skytribe, the Deepdwellers, or the Waterfolk. I want to know what your plans would be in the server. If you have some creative bits to bring, let me know. I am talking of prose, songs, etc.

I understand this is a large, improbable undertaking, but I think that with the right people, and a little adventurous spirit, this could be something amazing.

Are you with me?

I'm a pretty layed back dude when it comes to server administrating. The rules of the server are pretty simple. Basically, no griefing, and just try to have fun! And if you are a generally unlikable guy to most of the players, you'll be banned. (Read: Not just me. I try to be fair) There is a restricted building space south of the spawn, and around the spawn, reserved for future community builds.

I hope you'll come build with me and make my world awesome!

A few things: Map resets are rare. We've had only 2 since the server was started in november (one during the beta launch, and a recent one during the beta 1.5 launch) and I dont plan on resetting again unless the map format changes.

**Here's a breakdown of our Group system**
We have a dynamic Group system thanks to the *GroupManager* plugin. Our groups are: 

* Default
* Builder
* Pro
* Mod
* Op

 -and Admin, which is me of course. **Please note**: As a default player, you are required only to fully read the Rule-board, agree to follow them, and a staff member will then immediately promote you to Builder. As a builder you are free to go out and build anywhere that's not protected (a feature of Worldguard) and is not on anyone's property. There's PLENTY of space out there to build! Players that become regulars on the server, and contribute some good, well-made builds will be up for consideration of Promotion to the Pro group. Pro's have special privileges, ranging from various TP (teleport) commands, to command like /time day, /nick, and the privilege of using various fun-related plugins. Pros also get to use the famous Tele-stick (click-to-tele) After that, if a player enough of a regular, has contributed a good amount, and is a respected member of the community, he/she is then up for consideration to be either a Mod (low-level staff privileges) or an Op, (mid-high level Staff privileges).

We are an established server with about 6 months under our belts.  We recently upgraded our hardware and are looking for fresh ~~meat~~ players to come and enjoy some SMP goodness.  We have around 270 members on our [subreddit](http://mcnsa.reddit.com).  Many players use our mumble channel as well, so if that's your thing you'll have someone to talk to.

We'd love to have you, so here's some info.

* This is an SMP server, you are expected to survive.

* Mods don't give out items.

* **Griefing is not tolerated** and we have several mods (as well as moderators) that keep this to a very minimum.  Even if a griefer comes in, destroys everything we be able to undo all the damage for you.

* The server itself is hosted off of 16 gigs of ram, a 50 mbs connection, a 3.2 GHz processor, and all data is written to a SSD for maximum performance.

* Backsass to mods is tolerated as long as it is reasonable.  No noob towers, **overly** offensive language, or buildings close to spawn will be tolerated.

* We have mods in place to protect structures, as well as chests, furnaces, doors, and dispensers.

* TNT and flint and steel are disabled for obvious reasons, as is fire spread.

Basically the rules are don't be a complete ass, respect others, and play nice.  Have fun, but not at others expense.  We are a tight knit community but are very welcoming to new players.  So please check us out.

We are MCNSA.com

Sup reddit, No Bullcraft is going public! We're a (currently) small server with a ""no bullshit"" approach to Minecraft. We're all about having fun and building cool stuff. We have zero tolerance for griefing, if we catch you griefing you're gone, end of story. Our main town is outlined with glass, only [Resident] members can build and destroy stuff inside. Outside the town any person can build or destroy, if you make something really epic outside of the border we will consider protecting it to prevent griefing though. To become a Resident you have to play regularly in the server, and have the mayor (Zomiaen) grant you citizenship.

Our server is hosted in the Nexcess data center in Dearborn, MI. A quick list of specs:

* 16GB of RAM
* 3.2 Ghz 6 core processor
* 64GB SSD
* 1TB Enterprise WD Harddrive

We can theoretically hold up to 120 people, but we still have to put that to the test.

This server is run on donations to pay our 85$ a month hosting fee.(We're already halfway there for this month!) I don't believe in people being able to donate to get items, that would mess up the economy. However, everyone who donates $5 or more gets a custom tag! We will also accept donations for protecting areas of land outside of the town limits, $10 for 25x25, $20 for 50x50, $30 100x100, we can work something out if you need a bigger area.

To kick things off, I made a ""Hell"" area (can you guess where it is on the [map](http://nobullcraft.com/map/)? lol) This isn't like the nether though, its eternally dark so monsters spawn like crazy here. Somewhere in hell there is a tower encrusted with diamond blocks and a chest full of netherock, lightstone, and diamond tools. You just have to run in and take them, but thats easier said than done ;) Countless people have tried, some wearing full suits of diamond, *none have made it out alive*... I conveniently made a ""Highway to Hell"" starting at spawn, so its just a couple minute walk to the gate!

(Hmod+Cuboid+WorldGuard+Borderlands) [Hosted out of Seattle, WA, dedicated host]",10,4,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/eo0p9/dks_world_rppvp_no_whitelist_never/,"For reference sake, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/ek92t/dks_world_rppvp_no_whitelist_west_coast_na_hosted/) is the original server ad I posted a number of days back. Since then, I have learned much in running minecraft servers, and have got it setup much better now. Its now setup to the point where I feel confident in looking for more users. So, some information on the server, in addition to the old posting:

You'll start off in a somewhat deprecated spawn room. Still being rebuilt.

**Griefing information, Protected Zones:** Any griefing that is possible now is allowed, as there are various protections active. Explosions are globally disabled, nerfing both TNT and creepers. Additionally, I willingly will setup a protected zone for you to build your base on. I don't need to see a house built to set it up - you just need to pick a spot and ask to have it protected.

**User Commands and controls**: Type /help when you get in to see a list of most of the commands available to you. In addition, when you get an area protected, /cmod commands for your protected area will open up to you. Also, something I enabled just this morning: All players can currently use the /stack command. This autostacks (almost) every item you have that wouldnt normally stack. So, you can have stacks of food, stacks of doors, and so on.

**Additional Measures:** Fires will not spread on this server. Not from anything.

**Other points:**

* Server is currently only 8 slots max players. Don't worry, this is being increased soon enough. It *should* be up to 16-24 (possibly higher) slots by January (if not sooner) **EDIT SERVER IS NOW UPDATED TO 20 SLOTS!**
**Edit 2:** I just put in for another slot upgrade to 26 slots. We are going to run public with 20 slots here, making room for those on the reserved list (and room to add a couple more to reserve). As reserve grows, so will maximum public slots - as someone reserved is a donator, this gives us more funds to increase the max. slots.

* Donations are now being accepted per request of various users. Donation information is near the bottom of this post.

**Our Server address is:** dk.no-ip.org

Hope to see you there! If there is anything I have forgotten, I will add it to this post as it occurs to me. Any questions, fire away.

(Everything below this text has been added after posting)

**Mods that are coming in the future**: Craftziens, iNations (pending server-community approval)

**Mods that may be coming in the future**: WorldGuard (for quick .schematic backup, however I now have a backup measure in place already), Stargate Portals (if and only if the Nether dosen't come out for SMP 'soon').

**Map Border**: Borderlands is currently set to a square radius limit of 3,000 blocks away from the spawn. I think that will probably be big enough for a while. Not even sure how big of a map that equates to. We can always turn it up.

**Donation information**: Per user request, I have brought online the donation system before I really wanted to. I guess you guys want more than 8 slots before January, huh? Ok, heres how it works. [Donation link](http://artofwarcentral.com/main.asp?page=donatefront&amp;d=222441) Go there, make an account with art of war and then you can donate. Please PM me here with the ID of your donation, and your minecraft user ID to confirm you have in fact donated. Any amount may be donated. Here are the (hopefully, balanced) rewards you will get for donating:

There is a non-game breaking donation shop in place. checkout the forums for details.

This should be balanced, feels like it is to me. All players can get protection zones regardless of donated status, and there is no VIP group here, as it were. Please discuss the idea here, and what you think of it. If its balanced or not in your opinion, and all that good stuff.

The first thing that will be done with donations is to increase the max. player slots.

**ALL** money goes directly to the server (I don't pocket a dime). You are donating directly to my server account with artofwar. We are not(?) using paypal in support of wikileaks.

Again I iterate, I did not want to bring in donations already - I am doing this upon request of my users.

New players are classified as peasants (guests) and can not destroy anything, and must be promoted to citizens via [forum application](http://www.mymgn.com/board/forumdisplay.php?1528-Citizen-Application). The server is a pretty powerful machine with 8GB RAM and 100Mbit connectivity so it should be fine for many players.

We have setup regular world backups and map creations both static and zoomable. We created the starting area by spawning building blocks (to speed up the process) to inspire new players but we will go full legit over the next few days, legit meaning gathering materials, trading with other people etc.

We do not have any specific rules yet as you can see on the website (Hello World Post still there) anyone is welcome to create anything almost anywhere. If you like to create additions to our existing villages/creations you are more than welcome if you adhere to the ""theme"" of the place or if you feel like creating something totally different you can travel away and we will support you with warps to your new home!

Some noteable features we have

* Anti-Grief protections so that peasants (guests) can not harm your creations
* Nice starting area with alot of space for merchant shops this is our main trading hub.
* A public exchange of goods next to our bank!
* Secure Vaults made out of bedrock
* 5 areas are planned with fixed building locations (rp)
* A nice beach resort with beachbar where you can enjoy Cacti Mojitos
* Alcatraz Jail for really bad players! 
* A Football (Soccer) field - the pigs are winning at the moment
* A Basketball court
* We can create warp points to notable buildings and creations (if they are far away from the main hubs)
* We have a zeppelin traveling to Orgrimar and a LoL Pirate ship for happy moments!
* A not so big world tree and much more...

The general idea would be for server owners and staff to report any major griefing attacks from users or to post server problems in order to more quickly resolve issues. That way a potential griefer can't just run through out entire list causing trouble on every server.

The Minecraft community is generally against widescale 'ban lists' as they count them as unfair, but as we are a much smaller community we can fully explain why people are banned and let other server owners make the decision for themselves, or at least keep an eye on these players when they join.

In the future, when we have more servers, we could even use our contacts to run inter-server competitions, where one server 'hosts' an event or building competition each time.

Optionally we could also get together on Skype or Steam to provide instant updates on any major griefing that has been going on.

* **Description:**  If Minecraft has gotten too easy and you want a challenge this is the place to be.  You're all but guaranteed to die here.  Server difficulty is massively ramped up from vanilla settings and there are several gameplay changes in effect.  Our goal is to provide an atmosphere where individuals can enjoy a strong and challenging PVE survival atmosphere while still being able to engage in PVP outside of the spawn city walls if they choose.  For those seeking a simpler life free of monsters &amp; PVP they have the option of working to become a citizen and building inside the city walls where these features are disabled.  They will however need to suffer with everyone else until Citizenship is earned.  Those choosing to live outside the city walls will continue to remain immune from PVP when standing within their claims.  There is however a cost to living far away - convenience.  There is only one warp on this server (/spawn) and it's on a lengthy cooldown.

**NOTE:  mcMMO has been tuned drastically down from default settings for balance.**

**NOTE:  There are no donation perks.  There are no donations at all.**

**NOTE:  There are no handouts or advantages given period.**

A few notable gameplay changes:

* 1)  Mobs are much more plentiful.
* 2)  A variety of additional blocks are impacted by gravity.
* 3)  Cave-ins are very real risk of mining.
* 4)  All mobs have new abilities and immunities.
* 5)  The deeper you dig the more dangerous it becomes.
* 6)  Crops have a chance of dying.
* 7)  Buckets can't move water source blocks.
* 8)  Pigmen are always hostile.
* 9)  Etc.

* **Rules:**  Have fun but be respectful.  Individuals found to be cheating (this includes X-ray), glitching, or unable to control themselves in an adult manner will be banned without warning.  Beyond that, it's okay for people to get upset from time to time but don't go out of your way to be a dick.  Raiding unprotected chests is allowed.  Destruction of other people's builds just because you can however is not.  We've provided the tools necessary to protect yourselves and if people choose to not use them it's their responsibility.  Chain killing and spawn camping will also not be tolerated.

* **Description**

KittyCraft is a new Survival server, only a few weeks old as of this posting.

We are looking for mature players, and that doesn't necessarily mean 18+, adults only, etc.  If you can respect other players and type coherently, I don't care how old you are.

We have protection against griefing by the use of the GriefPrevention plugin.  When you place your first chest it will guide you on how to use it.

If you have any problems just contact the server admin or an online moderator.  Please don't ask to be a moderator.

Right now the server is set to allow 25 max players online at a time.  I'm not sure if this maximum is perfectly reflective of what the hardware can handle, and I will do my best to adjust as necessary, if we ever have problems with that number.

We are open to suggestions on how to improve, and want to make this server as enjoyable and fun as possible.  There will be a suggestion box in-game soon, and until that time, feel free to leave a comment below, or direct your suggestion to the server admin, **KittyTristy**, in-game via the mail system.


* **Rules**

**-** Be respectful to other players.

**-** Please do not advertise other servers.

**-** Try to keep foul language to a minimum.

**-** Do not ask for creative mode, daytime, op, mod, admin, etc. If we need help, we'll come to you.

**-** Do not abuse any exploits you find on the server.  Report them immediately.

**- We have zero tolerance for cheating. Don't do it.**

**-** And most importantly, **have fun!**

* **Description**:
 
Fool's Gold is a Minecraft Server based on the Gold Rush; find your fortune, make a settlement, trade with the residents of the towns or lose it all trying in this mean, gritty world.

This server's main objective will be the gathering of gold to buy stuff and to become rich. We have a custom generated map, with a highly increased gold density, but decreased amounts of other ores. Roleplaying will be highly encouraged, if not reqested. 

The Idea for this server has been around for more than half a year now, but until now it just was an idea. But this is going to change, and to make that change, we need YOU.

We're still in a very early stage of development, meaning stuff like ranks or an economy system are not fully established yet. 

We can use everyone right now. If you want to help with building, send a PM to /u/BrandonThePrez and show off your work. It doesn't need to be outstanding by any means, just show some general understanding of wild west architecture.

If you don't want to build, but still want to play once we're finished, remember to check the our subreddit once in a while to stay up to date, or even make your own posts there and tell us your ideas!

Role-playing here is encouraged and rewarded - It's a truly enjoyable and enriching experience.

Crimson Ingot has many of the typical features of a RP PvP server; however some of the more interesting aspects of the server are:

**Unique Classes** - Only Kings can create Factions and completely manage the finances and members and Oracles are able to see who placed/removed blocks. There are 4 more available classes.

**Powerful Magic** - Mages and Archers have different destructive magic and arrows based on their chosen creed.

**Creeds** - The land is watched over by omnipotent Deities - any one of these Deities can be aligned with and you will gain particular Powers, Skills and Abilities depending on your chosen alignment - allowing each to have a unique game-changing power, including: Immunity from Monsters, Breathe Underwater, No Hunger and much more. These Deities may answer your prayers or bring their wrath down from the heavens.

**Limited Rain** - Thanks to the Deity Deserma - you will not have to endure too much rain.

**Hidden Treasure and Spell Books** - Explore the map to seek amazing riches and unique magical powers.

**Shrines and Temples** - Impress the Deities with your building skills to receive favour and reward.

**Epic Bosses and Unique Items** - The lore comes alive with the chance meeting of key characters in battle and by finding special items that are priceless due to their history and power.

Description: 

Hello, this is a server which you choose a kingdom, each with its own perks, and you go level up by killing pvp, earn gold, buy land, loot others and earn titles. Gear is all bought through a gold system or found from killing NPCs and creatures with items on them. Then when you have geared up and have strengthened your kingdom, you can gather your friends together and invade another kingdom and raid them and kill their king. If their king is killed your kingdom can dominate the land and do with it what you want. There are Guards within each kingdom that protects the king which makes kingdom invasions a challenge. If you take the kingdom, the member of that kingdom can join another kingdom and re gear and re invade to re claim their land. Also there is an arena which holds grand PvP to all kingdoms where the king of the arena holds the title of (G.O.D God of death). Alliances and declarations of war among kingdoms are strongly encouraged. 
We hope to create something entirely new that people will enjoy, so give us a check and apply on our forum to get white listed for this beta event. All users who join now earn the immediate title of (Noble) whereas everyone else gets (Peasant) upon start up. http://forum.wearesection8.com

* **Description**:

Did you purchase Minecraft for your young offspring or other relative? Get them whitelisted on The Sandlot so they have a safe place to play!

The Sandlot is a moderated, family-friendly server designed to be a safe place for kids and families to play without fear of foul language, hate speech, vulgarity, and the other various scourges of the internet. 

We accomplish this using a whitelist, chat censoring plugins, block logging and anti-grief plugins, as well as visible and present moderator staff.

We also have a solid group of friendly and helpful adult-age players that are parents, friends, relatives, or just friendly strangers that enjoy the company of younger players.

Our server strives to maintain the ""vanilla"" experience, straying from it only when necessary to prevent stealing, griefing, etc. We never spawn blocks, and our moderators and administrators play the game just like every other player.

We have been running for over a year now, and recently moved from a VPS to a dedicated server for more stability and room to grow. We offer three worlds to play on: one easy, one normal, and one hard difficulty. We recently started a new map (our normal difficulty map) so there is lots of room for players wanting a fresh start. 

* **Rules**: Our rules are simple and common sense yet clearly stated and are available on our website. No griefing, no cheating, no swearing, etc... We do strictly enforce our rules, and do not make them up as we go along.

* **Owner/Admins/Moderators**: Owner: cheracc, Admin: ty564321, Groogaroo Moderators: Rioghan, OisinsVids

* **Pictures/Videos URL**: http://www.sandlotminecraft.com

* **Other**: We aim to be as close to vanilla Minecraft as possible while providing safety from other players that may wish to maliciously interfere with you. Players are able to protect their own land and lock chests and doors. Monsters (creepers, endermen, etc.) do not do block damage.

Betaworld is a politically-themed server with a Congress, an International Constitution, and Judicial System. Factions represent nations that can claim land, and set their own local laws.

1. PvP is only possible if both Factions agree to war. No sneak attacks are allowed. The server is PvE by default.
2. Anybody can join Congress, so long as you have a homestead within Betaworld. You can help draft legislation, or run to be elected as a Judge that keeps the peace.
3. If you don't want to be part of the politics, you can play normal survival with Factions on a very solid server.
4. To join, you must read the [Handbook](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0Bx0G3VvBGr4ETkVJZmtZNmNLb0E), and agree to our Constitution. You can only find the IP address for the server in the [Handbook](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0Bx0G3VvBGr4ETkVJZmtZNmNLb0E).
5. We have an interactive version of our Handbook for iPad, here: [Betaworld Handbook for iPad](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0Bx0G3VvBGr4EbmExdUNReW1wcm8).

* **Rules**: You must read the [Handbook](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0Bx0G3VvBGr4ETkVJZmtZNmNLb0E) and agree to our Constitution. Until you do, you can join but you cannot break or place blocks.

I am sorry to announce that due to several real life circumstances, I am no longer able to run this server. I am also sorry that I have not been around for the last few weeks and it fell into general decline. If anybody thinks they can do a good job and breathe life back into the server, please contact me to discuss transferring ownership. The current hosting costs around £9 GBP a month (roughly $14 USD or €11 Euro). If no one takes over running the server by the end of the month, I will release all of the server files, including the map, for download on this page.

Once again, I am very sorry to those of you who have put in a significant amount of time playing and building on this server. A big thank you to all of those who made it so much fun to run, despite all the hard work and griefiers.

**EDIT 2**: Apparnently, the server has been down today. I have no idea what could have casued this, since I haven't been online the past few days. According to the server control panel, it was online the whole time, but that was obviously wrong. I have restarted the server and it seems to be working now. Let me know if there are any more problems.

**EDIT**: Server is now back up after grief fixing. White list is on, but most of you who already played are on the whitelist. If you are not on the whitelist, send me a message here. I have disabled a very small number of items that can cause huge damage, plus installed a patch that should stop some of the items overriding towny protections (but probably not all, so still be careful). PvP is still off and it is now a perma-banable offence to destroy Towny protected property using exploits in Tekkit. Thanks for the patience. 


* **Server Name**: New Andalea

* **Server Address/IP**: 46.105.110.96:25592

* **Game Play Type**: Survival, PvE

***

* **Description**: This is a small community Tekkit server that is just starting out (you must use the Technic launcher to play). There is currently no whitelist, but one might be used in future if there is too much demand. Currently there are only about 4 players, but we have room for around 16 people at a time. It is primarily a PvE style survival server, however PvP is on outside of towns. We use Towny and LWC to hep you protect your builds and valuables, with an economy system so players can earn money to start and expand towns. We also have chest shops that can be opened on Towny shop plots. In order to discourage PvP, stealing and griefing, there is a set of 'laws' separate from the server rules. Breaking of the law has in-game consequences. 
For example, those who kill citizens will become outlaws. When an outlaw is killed, they will respawn in jail and must die in jail several times before they are allowed to continue playing as citizens. Punishments for other crimes are not fully implemented yet, but with Towny and LWC there should be no problems. Please act maturely and sensibly.

**EDIT:** Due to griefers using exploits in EE to break Towny protections, the rules have been changed to include not damaging anything that is inside a Towny protection. Bans will be given for this behaviour.

PvP has been turned off for now, and may just stay that way.

There is also now a whitelist. If you wish to join, please give your minecraft username in the comments. 

NOTE: There is also a bug that prevents the item Swiftwolf's Rending Gale form allowing flight sometimes, but not other times. I suggest using a jetpack or something instead if you wish to fly.

When you join, type **/help** for a list of help topics and commands.

* **Rules**:
1. No client mods other than the Tekkit pack
2. No X-ray or see-through textures
3. No hacks or cheats to change game mode or get free items
4. No spamming chat
5. No asking for OP or Admin powers
6. No asking for free items

* **Laws**:
1. Do not kill fellow citizens (killing outlaws is ok)
2. Only post bounties on outlaws
3. No stealing from other citizens (unlocked chests in the wild are fair game)
4. Do not destroy other citizens' property

* **Description**:

Have you ever wondered what it would be like re-enact Animal Crossing in minecraft?
I have!

Our wonderful team of admins have constructed a server from just their imagination and pure determination.
Just for you!

On Animal Crossing Wild Craft. You can own a house in a village and pay off your mortgage to earn the highest expansion!
The server is full of fun events which you will know from playing any Animal Crossing game!

In order to include PvP in this server we have made up certain events!
Including
- The bug-off
- The flea market
- The fishing tourney
- Christmas/Halloween Etc.
- Manhunt
- Team Vs Team
- Capture the flag
Each event has a big prize!

Not only can you pay off your mortgage to get a bigger house, you can donate money towards your town in order to earn exclusive structures for your village.
Eg.
- Nooks shop upgrades
- Lighthouse
- Windmill
- Outdoor furniture
- Fountain
And due to the upcoming release of Animal Crossing 3DS all towns willl eventually undergo a couple of makeovers to relate more to the latest Animal Crossing game!

Vanilla PvP
---
Enjoy Player vs Player combat in its purest, without the use of skills or the restrictions of towny and factions.

* Smart Griefing - Hate players hiding in their houses to escape you? But also don't like your structures being griefed beyond recognition while you are offline? Then Smart Griefing is what you are after.
On Solus Gaming's Survival/PvP server you can break blocks to enter the house of a player, to kill or raid chests. However you are not allowed to destroy/mutilate their house. Meaning that you can build with a piece of mind.

* No Chest Locking - Don't you just hate breaking into someone's house to find that their chests are 'locked by a magical spell'. Well you will never have that problem here. There is no form of chest locking by ANY player.

Additional Features
---
* Custom Terrain - The map at Solus Gaming's Survival/PvP was custom made with 23 unique biomes for you to explore and build on. A very nice change from default minecraft terrain generation.

* Non-Combat McMMO - McMMO provides extra things to do on a server but its combat skills are highly unbalanced and are just asking for people to 'bot' them. Enjoy PvP as it is intended but still gain progression for repetitive tasks such as land clearing and mining.

* Marketplace - You may buy and sell items via a user run global shop. Store some of your wealth in money so that you do not need to start from scratch if your chests are discovered.

* Donation Guarantee - At Solus Gaming's Survival/PvP server we pride ourselves in our fair donation rewards. You will never be able to buy item spawning, god mode, ability to fly or other PvP-breaking perks. There is no pay to win here.

* **Description**:

This… is Azurite 2.0.  

Actually, that’s a lie.  Azurite 2.0 is a Minecraft Server, while this is a series of alphanumeric characters typed into a word processor.  

But you don’t care about that, do you?  Of course not.  You’re just reading this to see if this server is worth your time.  So I’m going to tell you some of the awesome things, and you’re going to sit back and read about them.  Please.  

Azurite 2.0 is a tech server. It’s got IndustrialCraft, BuildCraft, and all sorts of newfangled RedStone doohickeys.  But if you don’t like the tech part, we still have some cool features and giveaways that don’t require complicated techy doodads.  More on those later.

“So what?” says Mr. Generic Reader.  “There are plenty of tech servers out there.  You’re not special!”  
That really hurts, Mr. Generic Reader.  Azurite 2.0 IS special.  And you want to know why?  BECAUSE SCIENCE, THAT’S WHY.  

And it’s not just the science!  Scroll down a bit and peruse the “Screenshots” section of this post.  See those buildings?  Frank Lloyd Wright (read: famous architect dude) couldn’t have done any better!  And most of those were made before we even went public!  Just imagine the kind of stuff that we’ll be making (with your help) in the future!  Azurite 2.0 has everything you need to build.  It’s got dirt, and iron, and dirt, and dirt, and wires, and dirt, and RedStone, and it even has dirt!  What more could you want?  

If that’s not enough, we also have a Mob Arena under construction, with planned boss fights and rewards.  That’ll be ready as soon as our admins get their acts together and figure out what they’re doing.  Trust me, it shouldn’t take long.  

And now, for my last trick, DONATIONS.  Most people won’t donate to the server, and we’re fine with that.  But for those of you with some spare cash in your pockets, you can get access to some cool stuff, choose a custom title, or other things like that.  

What do we do with these donations?  Well, right now we don’t have much planned.  We’d like to be able to use the money to improve the server, but we also want to give back to our community.  Ultimately, we want to be able to use the donations to fund prizes for raffles for our most active members.  We’ll also give a certain percentage of our donations to charity, which I must say is very generous of our admins.  Seriously, I have to say it.  They’re making me.  

* **Rules**: 

Rules and Guidelines

No Griefing. 

No arguing with authority.

Respect the Server and other players.

Use common sense and be civil.

Don't deliberately cause lag (redstone clocks etc).

Obey the spirit of the law.

The mods have wikis. Use them to get help, not the chat!

Any large scale projects (i.e. a subway system) you wish to work on 
you must present to a group of three admins, have a very detailed plan, and have at least 5 workers (Min. worker limit subject to change based upon project scale.)

If you find a bug, exploit, or other such defect to the gameplay let an admin know.  There will be a reward proportional to the severity of the case reported.

No frame quarries.

Upgrade solar panels ASAP.

Rules with Machines

Do not keep timers running all the time when less than 10 seconds.

No Watermill systems.

No Flax Capacitors, Mooshroom Harvesters, Dark Rooms, or any other 
FTB type machines.

No construction foam. 

You must have at least 3 layers of protection before running a nuclear reactor.

Only one Forestry farm of each type per user.

Failure to follow any of these rules and guidelines can result from anything from loss of privileges to a perma-ban.  Punishments will be decided by the admin/mod.

---

* **Description**:

The Sandlot is a small, whitelisted, 30-slot server offering a safe environment for young Minecrafters and families to play. We also have a close group of parents and older players that play here because they enjoy the overall civility and like helping the younger players.

We do not tolerate foul language, griefing, intolerance, etc., and we work hard to teach younger players how to play civilly with each other. Most players are pleasantly surprised with how mature our playerbase can be despite their age (we have players as young as 5). Those that are needy, beggars, or generally annoying do not tend to stick around, because they don't get the negative attention that they want.

We recently started a new map with the release of 1.3. There is tons of open land available for the taking. Our moderator staff is very present, yet very hands-off, making for a peaceful yet ""griefer-safe"" environment. All of the staff plays just the same as everyone else, with nothing on our server spawned or gained illegitimately.

Check us out for more information about the server:

**Lore**


**The Craftsmen** love to mine and craft. Their interests lie in building magnificent constructions, farming, alchemy or complex redstone mechanics. However, they also find it necessary to hide their riches and create lookouts and traps in order to fend off The Barbarians.

This warrior race is primarily interested in combat. **The Barbarians** are at war with The Craftsmen, and are more interested in killing in order to gain their food and treasure.

In the middle of all this we have **The citizens**, which are mostly merchants and mercenaries - there is uneasy peace between this group and the two rivals. Consequently, they often work as diplomatic go-betweens and messengers, arranging deals between The Craftsmen and The Barbarians, as well filling as a darker role - swords for hire. Additionally, they operate as shrewd traders, supplying the two rival opponents with food and equipment…for a price.


--------------------------------

**Classes**



**Blacksmith:**

**Craftsmen/Barbarians/Citizen**

Having a good blacksmith in your
faction is essential, if you want to keep your
faction well supplied. Wend a tool gets low on durability, a blacksmith has the ability to repair it using the material it was originally made of.



* **Alchemist**

**Craftsmen/Barbarians/Citizen**

Alchemists are a very powerful class.
all classes have the ability to use potions,
but only the alchemists are able to brew them.


* **Engineer**

**Craftsmen/Barbarians/Citizen**

The engineers are a smart class.
they have mastered the ways of redstone
throughout years of research, and are the only ones capable of using redstone.


* **Merchant**

**Citizens only**

The merchants are neutral businessmen.
money is what is most important for them, and the best way of getting money is by supplying the two rival opponents with food and equipment…

* **Mercenary**

**Citizens only**

Do you like pvp? but don’t want to choose side?
Then the mercenary class may be the one for you.
Any class have the ability to place bounties  on players heads, and you are the guy to collect it.
--------------------------------


* **Rules**:

- No client mods other then optifine!

- No X-ray texture packs or mods!

- Watch your language!

- No all caps messages!

- No spamming!

- Respect staff decisions!

- Don’t ask for staff rank or op!

- Don’t ask for game mode!

- When you are asked at a later point about the rules, reply: Of course

- Don’t use shop features for personal chest protection

- No out-of-game advertising

As you may know we have recently updated the rules to include what the community voted on. This now makes the [standard formatting](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/faq#Post) required, as well as implements some other rules for posting. Since this change we have greatly reduced the number of spam and nonsense server post to /r/mcservers

However we are now faced with another dilemma.

At the time of writing this, out of the top 25 post on the ""hot"" list, 48% of them are [Wanted] ads. Most of which are asking for servers that you already have listed. Things like ""*I am looking for a small whitelisted SMP server.*"", which more than one is already listed in the top 25 ""hot"" list. 

*It would seem the Wanted ads have become too generic, and seem to be taking over the ""hot"" &amp; ""new"" list on this subreddit.*

**So we have some options**:

* Remove the option to post [Wanted] Ads all together, so that only Servers can advertise on r/mcservers.

* Only Remove post that are asking for something generic and that are covered by our standard [classification of tags](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/faq#Class). And allow post that are looking for something specific (eg, ""*[Wanted] Looking for a Faction server running the deathchest &amp; inomcats plugin.*"") [*best option IMO*]

* Or, we can allow the Wanted Ads to continue to be a free for all, and take up the majority of top post on the ""hot"" &amp; ""new"" list, thus bumping server ads to be lower in rank.


**[VOTE HERE](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/LVCHYNH)**

Please fill out [the one question survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/LVCHYNH). We will let it run for a couple days to see what you guys prefer, and then adjust our moderation of post accordingly. As always comments or questions are welcome here.

EDIT: As of 20120808-0530EST it looks like the majority (74.2%) is tied to have the wanted ads cleaned up or removed.

* PvP Desert Arena for small matches. (Settle your petty disputes here!)
*Chernobyl-themed large PvP arena. If nothing else, come for this. The arena atmosphere is amazing and creepy as we could get it! (Camp out with faction members, attack your enemies and they won't stand a chance!)
* Multiple public areas such as the admin-run market where you can both buy and sell items for great prices, and the 24/7 Drop Hall, useful to people who want to get rid of items and for those who may need some.
* Public events and contests such as ""The Mine"", Spleef Arena, Log Jump, and more!
* Chest protection always available.
* Nocheat enabled for admins, so no hacking! Everything here is fair.
* Multiple worlds! So far we have a Creative world and a PvP/Faction world. More to come!
* Mature admin, cool people. :]

The world is backed up every 1.5 hours, so if you get griefed, the griefer will be banned and it is no problem to restore any damages. The world will not be reset for the forseeable future (all creations will stay where you put them) and the server is up 24/7 at all times possible.
So far this server has stayed small so there still LOADS of space to build stuff. There is free land literally 30 seconds away from the spawn in any direction. Yet there is still a lot of cool stuff around the world that has been built up, ready for you to explore. This server is very fast, so you can connect from all around the world without worrying about lag. For example, we have players from Holland, Japan, and Australia who do not have issues with lag. We currently have around 10 regulars across different timezones, and many more frequent visiters.

**Who We Are Looking For:** At this point we have a good base of all sorts of players, **so now we are looking for more Talented Builders, Awesome architects, or mature regulars.**  
Do you enjoy collecting all your materials on your own, and then building awesome things with your hard earned resources? Are you creative, mature, and love to make amazing structures that are functional and aesthetically pleasing? **If yes, then this is the right place for you, and you will be extremely welcome on our server!** This is a whitelisted server, so in order to join, you must first apply!

**If you do not want to fill the form , instead message me.** In the message to me, briefly tell me your age, your minecraft username, what you will bring to our server, what country/timezone you are in, or any other additional info that you might want us to know for example some people like to send us albums of the builds they've made in the past. **If you don't Follow the instructions your application may be ignored.**

We even have an active [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/crabdancemc/) dedicated to everything related to our server, where our players can submit pictures or posts about their WIPs, finished builds, adventures, or other shenanigans. Our players our encouraged to post here and share ideas, which has turned out great for our community!


**Some basic info: This is a...**


* Survival server, you can do whatever you like, build, mine, venture the nether, explore, conquer the end. Its up to you.

* We run bukkit.

* We try to keep the server as Vanilla as possible. The experience you can expect is the same mechanics as singleplayer, but with more players and much more fun.

* No mods. we do use a few plugins tho, but they are for anti-griefing and only the admin and the moderators can access them.

* Nothing that gives you an unfair advantage over other players is allowed. for example flying, hacking, thieving, using your own mods etc.

* No item Spawning. This is a vanilla server, everything you get or make MUST be legit.

* Fire and TNT is enabled

* Pvp is turned on, but this is not necessarily PvP server. just because you can hit people doesn't mean people want to be hit. respect other people.

* Neutral/enemy mobs do spawn.

* You do not need permissions to build places. However, if someone else has built something, respect their area. do not alter their things without their permission.

* We have two Spawns. The original is in pre 1.7 generated land, and a second spawn located in fresh 1.0 generated terrain!

Right now we're looking to expand to include more players to get PvP and commerce really going! 

Using custom terrain generation with custom objects (new trees, ruins, lamps, statues, and more), we've created a brand new exploration and combat experience from the ground up. HappleCraft uses TerrainControl with custom biomes and uses plugin combinations like Heroes and Mobs to create exciting new combat experiences!

Our server aims to provide a challenging and exciting play-experience for both PvE and PvP and has a variety of classes, skills, and abilities for players to use in both.

We are using client side mods, which I know can be an issue for some people, but we have provided some handy packages for you that make installation a snap! You can also easily backup your old minecraft files to switch back to your unmodded client easily if you so desire, though we hope HappleCraft will be your one-stop destination for Minecraft gaming!

A famous man once said, ""Art is the triumph over chaos."", then somebody killed him, stole his items, and griefed his house. If that sounds like a good time to you or you enjoy the thrill of building a base on a server where your life and loot is in constant jeopardy, then Craft Chaos might be the right server for you. We have no rules. And when I say we have no rules I really mean that. Be as rude, crude, and cruel as you want, we prefer to let nature run it's course. Piss off enough people and eventually your uppance will come. Whether you hunt players, raid chests, or earn your ore the old fashion way the choice is yours.

We believe leaving players to their own devices is the best way to run a server. But we enjoy adding the occasional optional opportunity at some PvP and loot through a bit of organized chaos.

Les quiero comentar que ya hace unos días nos mejoraron el server de minecraft de /r/mexico, ahora tenemos el doble de memoria RAM y más velocidad de CPU, esto le da mas estabilidad al server y podemos tener mas jugadores al mismo tiempo.

Todos pueden entrar al server pero para poder empezar a golpear cosas tienen que ser promovidos a “miembros” por poringo o por mí, también el server tiene medidas de seguridad anti griefing, puedes proteger tus cofres, tenemos un mapa en nuestra página web y todos los días tratamos de mejorar el server.

I'm currently running a really small home server following the ""Mindcrack doctrine"" and we're looking for a few decent folks to join.

The server is 1.2.5* private, **whitelisted**, pure vanilla, no mods, no ops, no economy, no factions, no donations, no shops or any other bull like that. I run a few plugins like block logging, backup and rollback for administration purposes only, but nothing that affects gameplay. No players will have op or admin rights (there is a separate non-playing account just for admin work). 

The map is pretty much untouched still, apart for a few fun builds at spawn just for kicks. There are a few community builds planned (like a nether rail hub) but nothing has started yet. We plan to build these things legitimately.

The server is in the EU (GR) and currently home hosted so no guarantees for 24/7, although I try to keep it operational most of the time. Only a few slots are available for the same reason. If we get a decent amount of active players, we plan on moving to 24/7 professional hosting, and also have events like ultra hardcore highlander, hunger games, race for wool and so on.

Please comment with a few things about yourself, what you are looking for, your location for time zone reasons and any questions you may have, and we'll work from there. 


*A note on the upcoming 1.3 release: Since 1.3 is probably a couple of weeks away, and since there is going to be a major overhaul on SMP mechanics, in all probability the server will continue on 1.2.5 for some time, until all issues with the new 1.3 servers are resolved.",,False,self,t5_2s3kg,1341232234.0,,,True,t3_vx5t2,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/vx5t2/small_vanilla_eu_server_looking_for_20_old_players/,

RPCRAFT 2012 is a new server that is striving for the real RPG feel that you get from playing your favorite games, from Runescape to Skyrim. We do our best here at RPCRAFT 2012 to bring this experience to the player in the easiest way possible. Right now, RPCRAFT 2012 has no Client Side mods, which means that there is nothing extra for you to download! Just pop in the IP address and start playing. We offer everything from custom RPG classes and attributes, to quests and dungeons, as well as advanced magical items not found in vanilla minecraft.

Our moderators are not only active on the server, but also act out of logic and reason; using a mature attitude and a keen problem solving nature to assist and moderate fairly and quickly. The entire mod team is dedicated to maintaining the Survival atmosphere and will not accept bribes or spawn any items for themselves or for other players. This is a Survival RPG for you as well as for us.

If you do decide to check it out and join our wonderful growing community, we have no whitelist, although we do take many measures to prevent griefing and cheating. You will find yourself spawned inside our one of a kind tutorial that aims to teach many ideas and commands in a simple, easy to understand way.

The maps will be reset every day and permanently deleted. There are two teams, the protectors and the destroyers. The job of the destroyers is to build any type of TNT cannon to decimate a town that the defenders have found. Defenders are to build and protect the town from the TNT cannons.

Attackers may not enter the town or place TNT anywhere except in a cannon.

Defenders may not sabotage cannons but may fire back.

Defenders must search and take hold of a town and inform the server of where the town is. Once a town's population has been decimated, all players should go out in search of a new town. Once one has been disocvered, defenders should take up hold and start defending while attackers should start building their cannons.

The server is creative so resources are unlimited and teamwork is crucial. PM me if you want to join and I'll give everyone the IP once I decide enough people want to play.

The server is in offline mode so players with cracked clients may still join and play.

Also, please don't try and lag up the server with a ridiculous amount of TNT. Use cannons or scattershots, dont make a huge bomb outside of the town. If defenders tell you to back off, then back up a little. Coming too close to the towns is unfair and unsportsmanlike. Cannons must include projectiles and the firing TNT. Do not create cubes of tnt and set those off or you will get a ban.


EDIT (JUNE 14)
Do:Spawn villagers. Build/augment to a town.

Don't: Build towns out of obsidian, build cannons entirely out of obsidian, sabotage towns as a attacker or sabotage cannons as a defender. A little obsidian is fine, as long as NPCs may still be killed or the cannon may still be rendered useless by blasts.

If no towns are found, attackers must help defenders build a town and spawn NPCs. Then, gaming may commence.

If someone is found breaking the rules, they may be reported to my reddit account and they will get a warning. after that, they are banned until further notice.

 We are a new server with 72 slots, this can be increased if we reach the maximum players allowed. The      server is from the United Kingdom and is online 24/7
 The server is mainly made for factions and PVP'ing, but we also have a range of other things to do such as mob arena, hunger games and more!
 We have a good variety of useful plugins installed as well as good customer coders on hand to make new plugins.



Vital Craft is a brand new server which is here to test your skills in the wilderness, your skills fighting against others and you chance to build up an empire and dominate the grounds and people around you. Or maybe you  want to bury deep, make a base underground hidden from enemy threats. The world is yours to explore and dominate as you please. With the help of many plugins we provide you with a great experience like no other. We are a friendly community with high aspirations for this server and the people in it.

Once you have made your factions and are on your way to complete dominance just remember that them sneeky not so dominant people can still access your chests if they find away into your house. So lock your doors, board up your windows and defend your empire!

We have allowed chest access in factions as it provide another level of gameplay to the server as them who are not so rich as the others can still manage to steal from right under your noses. They cannot open doors or even break anything, they can only open chests. Beware of the dungeon dwellers who seek to steal your empire from you.


* No combat logging (We have a plugin to stop this)
* No major abuse to staff, there is no point event trying as action will be taken against you.
* No racism of any kind, you will be banned instantly.
* No hacked clients of any kind.
* No xray texture packs or clients.
* Dont spam chat as its annoying and will end up you being muted.
* Do not ask admins to spawn you stuff or set you to creative (This includes people trying to use 'Forceop on me, im not stupid and you will be instantly banned)
* No inside raiding (dont join a faction just to steal there stuff then leave)



WE WANT YOU! WE ARE LOOKING FOR BIG STRONG FACTIONS WHO THINK THEY CAN TAKE OVER THE SERVER AND COMPETE AGIANST THE OTHER FACTION...

Summary: Based from the novels “A Song of Ice and Fire” you find yourself standing before Notch where he drops you into the game centered around a structure called “The Wall” in northern Westeros. It is a cold and harsh land where only the brave can survive. Players create new factions, and crumble others into rubble. Much like any medieval world the lore is shaped by the people who inhabit it. Using the plug-in ‘mcMMO’ each player chooses their path leading them to a specialty. Each specialty grants the player specific and unique abilities to overcome obstacles. Armed with the weapons of their calling, players work their way up the food chain, eventually creating their own house (town/faction) and forming alliances (nations) and grudges (war) with opposing houses to create a brutally beautiful player ran fantasy world.",,False,self,t5_2s3kg,False,,,True,t3_svwox,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/svwox/a_song_of_ice_and_blood_game_of_thrones_rpg/,

Our goal as a server is to create a winner-takes-all environment where players can build, kill, conquer, and more. We try to use as little restrictive plugins as possible so that players can really do whatever they want. (Besides cheating). There are no protected areas except for the spawn zone, the whole world is yours for the taking. Currently there are plenty of teams on the server looking to recruit players to build fortresses and wage war against other teams. Come join the fun.

If you want to find out more details check out our website. Or post on this thread. Hope to see you in game.

**Main Rules:**

1. Do not use cheats or client modifications that provide you with an unfair advantage. This includes things like xray, speed hacks, fly mod, pvp auto attack, etc.

If you are looking for the best Minecraft experience out there than PLAY.10HEARTS.COM is the server for you and this is why.   With our 100% uptime since we released the server and our automatic server restarts every two hours there is NO LAG and SMOOTH GAMEPLAY. 

This server was designed with every playing aspect in mind.  We have multiple plugins to allow players to play there way they want.  If you want to PVP and Raid bases then you can do that.  If you want to PVE and build cities then you can do that.  Our “BIG THREE” plugins include, FACTIONS, ICONOMY, and MCMMO along with multiple plugins to stop and rollback griefing and people cheating.

Our website has been designed to be extremely user friendly and has multiple functions to increase your out of game experience.  Our favorite is the “STATS PAGE” that shows not only overall server stats, but individual player stats as well.

Our 10 Hearts staff is friendly, helpful, and well informed. With the use of MODREQ we allow users to notify our staff of problems on the server.  If your request is made with no staff online it is then put in a queue and will be show to the next staff member to log in.  We request you make your MODREQ as descriptive as possible and if it is a location based request, we ask you make the /modreq at that location. 

We also have our own public mumble for the use of our 

**10 HEARTS IMPORTANT PLUGIN OVERVIEW**

* **FACTIONS** - is a plugin that allows you to create a Faction and claim land for that faction.  Once land is claimed it can only be edited by other members of that faction.  You can designate owners of specific land in your faction that is claimed so only that member can edit that land inside that faction.  If your faction is a “PEACEFUL FACTION” (PVE) they cannot attack or be attacked in their land and their land cannot be taken over or raided by another faction. However, PVE player can participate in “Warzones” which includes the PvP arena at spawn and when PvP events are held in the coliseum.  
If your faction is a regular faction or non-peaceful faction (PvP) is allowed anywhere except in “Safe-Zones” (which is spawn).   If their power dips below their amount of claimed land then there base can be taken over.

* **ICONOMY** – We allow iConomy on this server because we have a server market and allow users to create Chest Shops to individually sell their items while they are offline.  Also when users vote on the website www.10Hearts.com/vote they are rewarded in game currency.  You can vote for the servers daily to earn a reward every day.

* **MCMMO** – This is by far my favorite plugin on the server.  It is both awesome for PvE and PvP players. This plugin allows for an RPG-like experience to exist in the world of Minecraft complete with experience points, special powers, parties, and much more.  It is truly an amazing and fun plugin.

* **EXPERIENCED MINER** - Gaining experience to enchant items is a b****.  This plugin allows you to gain experience from breaking any natural block in the game.  The reason I said natural is because you cannot place and destroy a block to gain experience.

* **LOGBLOCK**- We use this plugin for a few reasons.  Because griefing of PvP factions is allowed we do not do it to roll back griefers. We instead use it to track players to make sure they do not x-ray.  We also use a lot of other anti x-ray plugins as well.  When it comes to PvE towns getting griefed by non-faithful members we can remove all of their grief within the town as well.

* **COMBAT TAG** – Is my favorite PvP plugin of all time.  This eliminates ANYONE from logging during PvP.  You might ask how that is possible and I will tell you.  Once you have been attacked by another player you and that player are both “Tagged” for combat.  If one of those players decides they want to be a wuss and leave the server creates an NPC of that player with the players’ equipment and full inventory on them.  If the player is killed while offline, when the player logs back in they will be sent back to their spawn point.  

**This and many more plugins and people make our servers great.  You should come check us out at play.10Hearts.com and look at our website www.10Hearts.com**

What is factions you might ask?  It’s a guild/clan oriented battlegrounds with virtually no rules.  It’s about as survival based as you’re going to get.  Griefing isn’t even possible in this game mode, it’s kinda the point.  You go around, recruiting people into your faction (up to 6) acting like a badass and fucking shit up.  Your faction can claim land, but that can become compromised if you die and lose power.  Your whole world can flip upside down in an instant, but don’t let that discourage you, as you can do the same to other people.  Stealth and discretion are two abilities that will really help you in this game.

We also have an incredible easy-going community filled with fun and friendly people from all over the world. There are always community projects and activities going on such as Livestreaming movie nights, contests, radio via Spotify, and a Mumble server for hanging out and getting to know your fellow crafters! Everyone is encouraged to get involved with projects and improve the community. The open and honest Staff are always willing to listen to ideas, questions, problems and concerns.  We've been around for over a year now and we're not going anywhere anytime soon.

* **Description**: 

Basic Craft is a mature, 18+ community currently seeking active new members. The server seeks to cultivate a fun, welcoming community for its players. 

Although the server is PvE, Basic Craft has a large PvP arena for single battles against other players. Admins regularly organize PvP battle events, in which you could be fighting each other in an epic battle royale, or multiple mobs at once. 

On top of community events in the PvP arena, Basic Craft also hosts community events in its games room. Basic Craft currently offers Hungry Hungry Hippos, Blockey, Temple Run, Parkour, Archery, and Spleef for everyone to play. If you do well enough, you'll be given a great prize and be inducted into Basic Craft's trophy room!

Our admins are currently making a NEW games room. The games listed above are still available to play, but will be moved to a new location with new games as well! If you have an idea for a game that you'd like to see added to the server, join today and add a suggestion!

Admins also run server events occasionally and announce a week in advance. Past server events include battles against multiple wither to earn a wither star and battles against multiple ender dragons to earn a dragon egg. Currently, the admins are planning a building contest for the server. Join now and have a chance to vote on the next server event!

If you're into community-style building or like to have neighbors around you while you build, Basic Craft has a wonderful neighborhood located in one of our forest biomes with a newly-finished community center. The next community project in the area will be a train station for the server's transit line, so join soon to be included in the project!

The wonderful admins at Basic Craft are currently upgrading our jobs center. The job center currently offers farming, mining, and excavation jobs. Use these jobs to earn in-game currency to buy essentials like food or armor, or to buy in-game currency exclusives such as a lava furnace. Using the jobs center also increases your McMMO points! Join now and be apart of the job center's grand reopening!

Even if you don't want to participate in community events or you want to play a more vanilla game without using in-game currency, Basic Craft is still the server for you. Above all else, the server constantly strives to remain inclusive and engaging for all members. So if your play style is to go the farthest corner of the map and build a hobo hut, then that's just fine with us!

Best of all, Basic Craft is still growing. The owners and admins are constantly coming up with new ways to enhance the server, and they want YOUR input. 

Recently, admins installed SkyBlock which has become a popular addition to the server.

Furthermore, the members of Basic Craft voted on a new Mob Hunter plugin to make the game even more interesting and challenging for members. 

If you want to be part of a server where your voice will be heard, Basic Craft is perfect for you.

To join, please make an account on the [Basic Craft website](http://basiccraft.org) and then submit a [Whitelist Application here](http://www.basiccraft.org/join). 

OR

If the application is blank/doesn't load, you can post your application in [this thread](http://www.basiccraft.org/forum/m/8231739/viewthread/5455160-basiccraft-20-whitelisting/page/10).

Our admins are attentive and active, so you won't have to wait long for an answer back! I hope to see you on the server soon!

* **Rules**: 

No harassment of other members in chat or Mumble. Always be respectful and polite to your fellow players. If you are being harassed, report to an admin.

No use of racist or homophobic language (or any hatespeak) in chat or in Mumble.

No griefing, even if a player's build is unprotected. This includes destroying blocks and/or stealing blocks. This also includes stealing from unlocked or unprotected chests.

No use of X-ray texture packs or any hack clients; this is considered cheating.

No harassing admins. This includes for in-game advantages such as items or teleporting. This also includes asking for positions as an admin or moderator. The admins will let users know how to apply for these positions when/if they're needed.

As this is an 18+, mature server, cursing IS allowed and you should expect mature discussion. If you are uncomfortable with that, then this server may not be for you.

 Here at Minecraft Junkie we just love Minecraft and playing it, so our server is about feeding that addiction and just having fun playing this amazing game. We feel everyone should be able to play, so our server is 100% public right away, you may build right off the bat and we have no builder rank.

 Also, for our server to be public and grief free, we have a team of staff devoted to preventing griefing at all costs, so everyone can play the game and not worry about their builds and items. Also our staff are promoted to playing just like you, they do not spawn items and we keep the true vanilla feel.

 We are very centered around the idea of a community. We have many towns, cities, businesses, and whole civilizations of people working together to survive in the world of Minecraft. Each community can do whatever they please. They can institute their own economy system, make their own community storage, create farms, have leaders, make jobs, literally anything. This is what makes Minecraft Junkie so great, our communities and the people on the server are always just there to have fun and play Minecraft.

* **Description**: The server currently has a starting world (**Hub**), 2 main worlds (**Chaos** and **Freebuild**), and a project world (**Towns**). We're now over 2 years old, and we hope to last another few :)

**Hub** - Starting world

From here you can get to the other worlds using ""/worldname"". e.g. /chaos

**Chaos** [PvP][Chaos] - New map!

Chaos world (obviously). PvP, build a base, grief, steal, or team up and make friends. Your choice. A mix of players play here. Play as ""hardcore"" as you want, or not.

End and Ender chests are disabled. 

Nether portals are currently a little buggy, use the ones at spawn to be safe.

Clans, although completely optional, are also available using /clan

**Freebuild** [Creative]

Plot based world. Use ""/plotme auto"" to be given a plot, for items, use ""/i itemname #"", e.g. /i diamondpick 2. Or, ask to be given creative mode (will be fixed soon so players can activate it themselves).

**Towns** [PvE] - 'Project world'

Although all players can explore this world (and fly using /fly, once it's fixed). Only certain players can build in this world. If you are interested in building in this world, message me. Although we are pretty strict here.

**Survival** [PvE] - Optionally [PvP] - Coming soon

* **Description**: This is an experimental minecraft project. The server's main focus is learning from other people, and dividing fields of ""academia"" or minecraft projects into player-built towns, factions, organizations, etc. Mostly all kinds of discourse is acceptable, except for anything insinuating something oppressive in nature (i.e. racism). We are looking for player who are interested in hanging out, talking deep, or even learning from each other. Also those who enjoy building too. The Academy is an open environment for learning, agitating and discussing. Fields/towns can take on any topic, and freely collaborate. Ideas like: psychoanalysis, neuroscience, philosophy, politics (i.e. liberalism, marxism, anarcho-hereyougo, free market ideology, etc.), comp-sci, maths, english, languages, linguistics, music, music theory, art history, etc. etc. We want you! Builders and ideas are always needed to construct towns. If any of this interests you, you're invited. Currently we have a pvp-free protected spawn, and some developed + in-development towns.

* **Rules**: There are no distinct rules. Citadel and Prison Pearl establish a sense of player-oriented governments. None of this admin autocratic bs.

* **Description**: 

Miner Apocalypse is a hardcore, semi-vanilla survival server that facilitates and encourages RP, but does not require it.  The server is set in a post-apocalyptic world where there are no laws and there is no authority (But there are server rules!). However this does not mean that civilisation is lost! Cities and factions rise from the ashes of the wasteland and attempt to live in peace or to achieve domination. Anything is possible on Miner Apocalypse as long as you have the will to pursue it. Feel free to go out and make friends. But be wary, some people on your path may not be as friendly as you hope.

The world of Miner Apocalypse is changing and the apocalypse survivors have rediscovered an old technology, the radio! It is the only way available for survivors to communicate over long distances. Re-join the apocalypse like you have never experienced it before with an all new hand-crafted custom map and custom plugins written especially for Miner Apocalypse!

A brand new custom plug-in was just introduced with the 1.6.2 update, Blocksaver! Blocksaver aims to provide a simple and intuitive method of block reinforcement to further balance builders and griefers. You can see a video demonstration [here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am4H9tzvZjU) 

Experience a massive 10K x 10K map created just for Miner Apocalypse with epic landscape features, such as volcanoes, waterfalls, craters, rivers, and mountains that extend above the clouds. Every block is put there to create an immersive and epic apocalypse experience.

*Some more information about Miner Apocalypse:*

• Tight knit, friendly community – Here at Miner Apocalypse we have an incredibly close community. Alliances crumble overnight and new enemies are made daily, as the server constantly produces new factions and new cities. You will come to learn how far a reputation can get you.

• Apocalyptic atmosphere – We have a local chat plugin that only allows players to communicate clearly within 100 blocks, beyond which the message becomes distorted and nameplates aren't visible at long distances. To communicate over long distances, survivors must use radio towers. .

• Griefing, raiding, and PvP are allowed – Anywhere on the map, that means there are no protected zones and of course, nowhere is safe. Arm yourself! There is little room for pushovers on Miner Apocalypse. Defend your possessions!

• Paid for by donations – Meaning that it is absolutely free, forever. Donating can earn you little perks such as unique in game flair and a reserved slot if you donate a certain amount. But we promise you don’t have to donate to have fun on the server.

• Run by the community, for the community – Have a good idea for the server? Post on the subreddit and gather support for your idea. The server is made for the community, so they make the decisions.

• Close to vanilla, Miner Apocalypse is close to vanilla so it's easy to pick up and play. Miner Apocalypse has tweaked the vanilla experience to provide a unique a balanced experience.

* **Description**: A Scoop of Vanilla is just that: a vanilla server.  We strive to maintain a positive community that is driven by mutual respect and a love for the game.  We welcome all age ranges, but expect a high level of maturity from all of our players, regardless of age.  The rules reflect a gameplay style of cooperative building and survival.  The plugins stated below are only usable by OPs and are only used in the case of repairing griefing damage or resolving issues (both of which rarely happen).  There are no advertisements or donator perks; everyone is on the same level.  The server's moderators are always open to suggestions from the community.  A simple post to the subreddit will be seen and replied to quickly.  Applications to be added to the whitelist are [found in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/asov/comments/1jkoje/applications_are_reopened/).  We are looking for players who enjoy the game and want to build together with others who enjoy it.  PVP is allowed only if both parties agree to it beforehand.  Most Saturdays Zamiul hosts a UHC battle on a sister server, so look forward to that.

* **Description**: 

This is a new server, new map. This server is for players who just want a safe place to build. The right plugins are in place to help keep griefers out and good builders in.

 The [griefprevention](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yop9isF0LbU&amp;t=1m57s) plugin allows you to use a gold spade to claim blocks and protect your precious builds. Players can only build within these claim blocks. If other players still use the claim areas to cause havoc, then the claim will be removed and the area restored. Both griefprevention and logblock have rollback capabilities.

Since this is a new server, there aren't any players who visit besides the one's who come across this advert. So, if you'd like to start something new, then this is a good opportunity.

* **Rules**: Be cool. Respect other players.

* **Description**: Spiralcraft is a Factions based PvP server with a custom generated world made from World Painter. Our map is separated into two continents, one to the North and another to the South. On our server you can explore each continent and the different cities that are built there.  Each city has unique shop items, prices, and PvP opportunities. We encourage to explore our world and to raid and fight other players.

We have a ton of special features on Spiralcraft such as a special traveling shop which sells a limited amount of rare RPG items and have even hidden other rare items across the world.  The more often you explore the map the more likely you are to finding a surprise.

The spawn of our server is on an island centrally located on the map. Our spawn building is specifically built underneath a volcano. From there you can walk to the portal house which teleports you to either the Northern or Southern capital city. After that point you can explore the world or walk into the wilderness to start your own base.

We have a list of rules which you can access on our server by typing /rules. However the most important thing to know is that griefing of any safezones or warzones is strictly forbidden and will result in a perm ban.

You are protected from PVP in the overworld. PVP is limited to the Nether, End, and Mob Arena.  

  The [griefprevention](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yop9isF0LbU&amp;t=1m57s) plugin allows you to use a gold spade to claim blocks and protect your precious builds. You start with 500 claim blocks and earn 70 per hour. So build slowly and protect as you gain more claim blocks. 

  The /prefixchat command lets you add a colorful prefix to your name. 

  There is only one ""free"" warp command: /spawn. You can set your bed or use /spawn as your resting place after deathban.

  There's more information on the website at http://spawnpad.me.

* **Description**: We are a seasoned Minecraft server with a brand new main world. This map is custom generated, so its outstanding terrain features can't be found anywhere else. A wide range of mods and plugins are there to give you an exclusive gameplay experience which is fair, challenging and unique.

On Winthier, we focus on legit gameplay with an even balance. No one gets overpowered advantages by donating or voting. Our focus is to provide a fair challenge to everyone.

One important aspect is our economy system. We have a market for people to open their own shops as well as an auctioning system. Both stimulate trade and make sure that your endeavors will always be rewarding.

To protect you and your builds from harm, we have many safeguards in place. One is a claims system which allows you to easily protect your areas so nobody but you and the people you trust can make any changes to them. Player vs. player combat on the other hand will only be enabled by mutual agreement, signaled to the plugin by punching another player. With these and many other protective measures, especially our very active staff, you can consider yourself safe from griefers, cheaters and other nuisances.

Other features include, but are not limited to:

- Home System (set home locations to teleport to)
- Chest Shop System (setup chests selling items for you, along with auctions)
- MobArena (fight waves of enemies with your friends and make extra money)
- PokeMob (capture creatures in eggs)

We have powerful hardware which allow us to host an established community with a wide range from casual gamers to dedicated Minecrafters on several additional servers. In addition to the mainserver, you are encouraged to also check out the Creative, Semi-vanilla and Feed the Beast servers that are at your disposal in the Winthier Network.

* **Description**: McExiled is an interesting server. It's not just your average factions pvp server, it has a twist. You live your life underground. Every city is based underground. Visit the dwarven city of Rhakor, the underwater city of Marinova, or stay comfortable in the spawn city, Haven. Above the ground, It's far too cold to survive. Every few seconds you take 3 hearts of damage UNLESS you have a heat source nearby. The underground is an interesting place, with massive caves, each one having its own biome. Back to the surface, you will find biodomes and villager homes. Inside each you will find room(s) that contain treasure. To get animals, find them in a cave and lure them back, or obtain a spawn egg through the market in Marinova, or find them in biodomes/villager homes. Most of the necessities can be found in the market at spawn.

Here's a quick runthrough of what I'm looking for:
PvE, No Open PvP (PvP arenas/seperate PvP worlds are fine but I'm a builder not a fighter)
Bukkit Essentials. /Home is a must and /back is appreciated.
Treeassisst or something similar is highly welcomed. Like I said, I'm a builder. I need a lot of lumber sometimes and I hate floating treetops.
Things like McMMO or classes can be a plus for me if not over done.
No factions. 
Some sort of grief protection is a big requirement as many of my builds tend to be large and take a lot of work so naturally I like to protect them.
I generally frown upon donor perks (if your server is good people should want to donate just to keep it running) but I can tolerate small donor perks.
I'm 17 almost 18 so I don't care about language and I would prefer a server with people around my age or older. Although some people my age can be immature and maturity is what I'm really looking for.
That's about it. Let me know if your server matches what I'm looking for. If it doesn't, and you know it doesn't, don't use my post as advertising for your server.

(5): Hacks or exploitable mods are strictly prohibited.

(9): Deaths do not warrant you an item refund ever.

(10): If a chest is unlocked, you may steal from it.

(11): Killing other player's Livestock is considered grief.

**Description**: Legitmine is a community-based server inspired by the gameplay of true Minecraft.

While mostly a vanilla experience, some things have been changed to compensate for the modern Minecraft experience:

* We run a carefully balanced mob-based economy - kill mobs for cash and use that to stock up on supplies in our admin-only shops at spawn or trade with other players
* We do have a strict no-griefing policy, and this rule will be enforced by banning and undoing all damage. Your structures are safe - just contact online staff or post on the forum. 
* PvP will be available in community-built arenas but NOT in the general map.

The map can be viewed from http://map.legitmine.net

**Rules**:

* Rule #1: Be civil in chat and everywhere else - no caps, hate speech, racism, sexism, or slurs.

* Rule #2: No griefing, mods/cheats, or harassment - violators will be banned. You may appeal on our forum at [legitmine.net](http://legitmine.net) - we consider all appeals on a case by case basis.

* Rule #3: You are responsible for your account - we don't accept excuses that your friend/sibling etc griefed and not you on your ban appeal.

* Rule #4: We are a 'legit' server - no tp, give, fly, etc. If you have to ask if you can do it, the answer is probably ""no.""

**Description**: Empire Minecraft is a unique experience compared to standard MC servers. It consists of multiple servers that are in many ways connected. For example you can move items and blocks between servers using the Vault. On each SMP server is a Town world with over 1,500 residences, the size of each is 60x60 blocks! Every player is allowed to claim a residence without any white-lists or application process.

The Empire is a ""legit"" community, not ""creative"". You have to explore and mine to find resources. We believe this the most fun and adds more depth to the game. On Empire Minecraft even the moderators don't have the power to spawn/give items, they also play legit.

There is NO PVP anywhere on any Empire Minecraft server.

**Description**: Remember the thrill of your first day playing Minecraft? Learning how to craft items, surviving the night, all by the skin of your teeth using just your wits and your wooden tools? This is the experience we try to replicate at Legitmine. Outside of spawn, the world is your oyster. Survive solo or join a village of players. Hunt down vicious mobs for money. Adventure, build, invent, and return to the true spirit of Minecraft!

Our small 20-slot server has been around in multiple forms for nearly three years and we have a very friendly international player base and experienced moderating staff. If you’re new to multiplayer servers, this is a great place to start! There are just a few commands and simple rules.

* [aktuarie’s Farm](http://aktuarie.com/blog/2013/3/26/the-farm-first-progress-pics)

---

While mostly a vanilla experience, some things have been added to compensate for a multiplayer server:

* A mob-based economy - kill mobs for cash and use that to stock up on supplies in our buy-only shops or trade with other players
* No-griefing policy - enforced by banning and undoing all damage. Your structures are safe - just contact online staff or post on the forum. 
* PvP is disabled on the general map but we do allow it in designated arenas. Be the first to build a Coliseum for our aspiring gladiators!

---

**Rules**:

* Be civil in chat and everywhere else - no caps, hate speech, racism, sexism, or slurs.

* No griefing, cheat mods, advertising, or harassment - violators will be banned. You may appeal on our forum at [legitmine.net](http://legitmine.net) - we consider all appeals on a case by case basis.

* You are responsible for your account - we don't accept excuses that your friend/sibling etc griefed and not you on your ban appeal.

* We are a 'legit' server - no tp, give, fly, etc. If you have to ask if you can do it, the answer is probably ""no.""

- Whitelisted

- Rules against griefing / spamming / general dickery

* **Description**: CraftSiege was born when a group of players, playing on another Minecraft server decided that they themselves could in fact do better. Sick of the all the drama, bias, hypocrisy, ignorance, and staff who insisted on using their position to promote their agenda, the three individuals consisiting of Grixer, Ikorolch, and RelentlessSoviet set off to accomplish this challenging task.
Their goal was quite simple. The goal was to create a server by players for players. Having experienced a variety of other servers, we decided to put together the best possible combination of plugins, gameplay, and policies to create an environment that is driven by you the player. Our philosophy is to maintain an extremely limited role in the player’s everyday lives on the server.
As a result we think we can establish an element second to none. Players on CraftSiege won’t be dictated by the staff on what they can and can’t do, they won’t be stone-walled by staff who are biased due to hearsay, their situations will be examined case by case based on context. Here at CraftSiege we want the players to create and control their own destiny, to shape the events that go on our worlds themselves, and to create an experience that anyone can enjoy. Welcome to CraftSiege.


* **Rules**:CraftSiege Rules
1. Respect the staff.
2. No use of hacked clients is allowed.
3. No griefing is allowed.
4. Use common sense.
5. Stealing is allowed.
6. No advertising
7. No combat logging.
8. No swearing in Global, use Mature chat instead.

**Description**

 
Server Owner: Zekeprower

 
Server admins: Phaedrusmind, I_Am_Throat


**We have added the Battle Arena Plug-in!!**

 
Our world has changed and we have been blessed with completely custom biomes. You may find yourself wandering through volcanoes, mountains, floating isles, hell biomes and much, much more! There are bosses to battle, and loot to be found. There are hidden cities, magical places that will teach you spells. But don’t forget above all this, we are an MCMMO factions based server. The beauty that you find you must protect with your guilds power and wit. Also if you like to play blackjack, well guess what… we have that too!

 

 

We are a pvp based server using the mcmmo plugin and we play legit, don’t ask for the items, earn them yourself! We have added the Battle Arena plugin to our world to allow people who wish to pvp right away the ability to have a kit and jump right in. There are 2 game modes as of now, one being 1v1 arena, and the other being a 8 person ffa that is a timed match, items spawn on the map and the player with the most kills at the end wins. Anyone who feels they are the best can challenge someone to a duel in any arena and even bet on their match. Our map is 7000 blocks in all directions from spawn. You can teleport to spawn for free but only once every 30 minutes, you may use warp signs to visit the cities but they cost money.  Spawn is safezoned and provides a few basic items at a server shop. You will spawn with 2 dollars so spend your money wisely. To earn money you can sell items from your hand. We have tried to balance our economy so that 1000 dollars is a lot of money. There are 2 other cities around the map which contain better gear, blocks, and food offered from server stores. The cities also offer great loot and boss fights in hidden areas. Don’t be a afraid to look for buttons on this map. There are many and most of them do something!

 
**Rules**:  There are 3 admins and a group of mods to help keep the server enjoyable and cheat free. Our mods are experienced players with no benefits, no gamemode, etc. They play the game like everyone else. Some basic rules to the server are: be mature, no cheating, no game mods other than optifine or mcpatcher, no chat spam, no begging. Basically use common sense. Different rule violations bring different punishments.We will ban anyone right away if we catch you xraying, or using any game mods which are not accepted. Our mods are experienced players and they have heard every story in the book, it is best to admit what you have done and hope for mercy (if applicable). All bans are final.
