1360755525.0,216,self.TeraOnline,18fuwi,"[GUIDE] So, you just hit 60",256,40,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/18fuwi/guide_so_you_just_hit_60/,"The Permanent home for this guide was, ironically, lost. Edited for Nexus update May 7th 2013.



So, you just hit 60. By now you've probably asked yourself, ""What the hell am I going to do now?"". There is a lot of advice available, some of it awful, some it isn't. This thread is for you brand new 60s, from the perspective of a launch veteran as well as a returning 60. Really it's the best of both worlds in terms of things that people already knew about, mixed in with all the new TERA: Rising content that we've been given. For convenience I've broken the guide down into sections, it turned out to be quite long because there is a lot of information you should know about. Unfortunately it took me awhile to write this, because the more I wrote, the more I realized needed to be included in order for this guide to be as complete as possible. 

**Index**
*I. Making money*
*II. Which dailies should I focus on?*
*III. Glyphs*
*IV. Sleeper Gear vs. Keeper Gear*
*V. Nexus*
*VI. Gearing for PvP*
*VII. Masterworking*
*VIII. Preparing yourself for Hard Modes*

**I. Making money in TERA--------------------------------**
&gt;I'm sure by now you've seen some of the broker prices for top tier gear in TERA.  These numbers can seem pretty overwhelming, but if you're dedicated and get a little lucky, you'll be brandishing Regent weapons and saving up for Visionmaker gear in no time.

**Balder's Temple Sloths (aka monkies)**
&gt;Enter the Balder's Temple dungeon alone and turn left after the entrance. You'll see a field of sloths idling about. Kill these and sell the drops to the vendor. Repeat this for the Hard Mode instance. Come back and farm them again when your dungeon cooldown timer is open.

**Dailies**
&gt;Depending on whether or not you are Elite, dailies can reward you between 500-2000g per day. Some reputation merchants, like Invalesco, sell items that can sell for quite a bit on the trade broker as well. Make sure you complete all of your dailies each day, and if you are Elite do not turn in your dailies until you have 18-20 ready and are able to activate your Quest Reward boost as well as your Reputation boost.

**Dungeon Drops**
&gt;Eventually you will begin doing dungeons at 60. Some of the drops in dungeons are quite valuable and a lot of new (or bad) players make the mistake of selling these items to vendors, or worse, at prices much lower than what they are worth on the broker. For example, do not ever ever ever ever sell T14 items to the vendor. You'll notice that they sell on the broker for as much as 10x their vendor value, because many other players require these items for enchantment fodder. Depending on whether or not you are on a PvP server, some T13 gear falls into this category as well. Be safe and always check the broker before selling dropped gear to a vendor.

&gt;Some other stats that often get seriously undervalued: x2 Attack speed on superior-quality enchantable weapons, x2 Boss damage received on superior-quality enchantable armor, crit damage or crit rate on rings and earrings, Stun length reduction on earrings, attack speed on amulets. Always check the broker to see how much items with equivalent enchantments are going for before listing your item. Just because it lists for 600g does not mean your item is worth 600g.

**II. Which dailies should I focus on?-----------------------**
&gt;There are two faction reputations you should always invest in first: Unified Field Lab, and Jax Trust. This is especially important for non-Elite members, as there are far more daily quests available to you than your limit of 10 per day.

&gt;The reason you are focusing on UFL and JT first is that these two factions can reward you with some seriously awesome items in comparison to the other factions in the game. Depending on your class, either UFL or JT will have maximum item level, non-enchantable gear available for purchase without a reputation level pre-requisite. This  means as soon as you save 900 credits for that faction, you are able to purchase gear that is almost as good as endgame +10 Nexus/Abyss gear. Obviously since they are missing enchantments they are not best in slot, but considering how little work you have to do to receive this gear you'd be a fool to pass it up. These chest pieces also have the same special bonus stats found on Regent armor, making them some of the best Sleeper gear in the game for certain classes.

&gt;Lastly both UFL and JT offer Rare and Superior quality enchantment fodder for purchase as you gain faction levels with them. Depending on your server, this will likely save you thousands of gold as you are attempting to Masterwork and enchant your Keeper set. Make sure you are doing these dailies every day!

**III. Glyphs-------------------------------------------**
&gt;By now you should understand how the Glyph system in TERA works, so I won't explain how to use it or what your best glyph setup is. What I can tell you is that there are special glyphs available for purchase with specific dungeon currency that either cost less glyph points or evolve your abilities in previously impossible ways. Saving one glyph point on a skill glyph may not sound like much, but cumulatively this can provide you with anywhere from 3-6 extra glyph points for use on other skills.

&gt;There are two dungeons available to you at 60 that provide the currencies you'll need to purchase these glyphs: Temple of Temerity and Sirjuka's Gallery. Both dungeons sell different sets of glyphs (with some exceptions) so you'll need to do both in order to unlock them all. As well, both dungeons reward a secondary currency that you can use on special boxes that have a random chance of providing you with junk, or a rare glyph.

&gt;While rare glyphs are not a necessity for progressing into Hard Mode dungeons, they can make a noticeable difference so it is imperative that you spend as much time as possible after hitting 60 grinding ToT and SG for glyphs.

**IV. Sleeper Gear vs. Keeper Gear---------------------------------**
&gt;Sleeper gear is a term used for items that you don't plan on keeping, but still need to progress through content in the game. MMO players typically invest far less money on sleeper gear than they would on its counterpart, Keeper gear. Keeper gear is a term applied to items that you plan on investing a lot of money on to improve their stats. In the case of TERA, your Keeper set is the set you plan on Masterworking and enchanting to +12.

&gt;The easiest set of Sleeper gear you can get in TERA is the reputation armor from UFL or JT that I mentioned before. These items don't cost much and don't require an investment for enchantment. The Nexus is also a great way to earn Sleeper gear, which I'll get into more later. Whatever you do, don't spend any more money on this set than you have to. You're going to need that money for better jewelry and your Keeper set. 

&gt;Your Keeper gear in TERA will, depending on your class, likely be a combination of Nexus, Conjunct, Abyss or Regent gear. Ultimately everyone's dream Keeper set consists of a full set of Visionmaker armor and weapon. Make sure you research what the best non-Visionmaker items are for your class, as they can vary pretty wildly in terms of their costs.

&gt;For jewelry you will want to check reputation vendors to locate socketed rings that have a special stat specific to your role. For example the Shariar vendor has socketed rings with a special +1.5% damage stat, making them ideal for DPS classes (duh). Socketed earrings can also be obtained from ACNM, ACHM, and MCHM. If you prefer to PvP, you can grind out Bellicarium credits to purchase Conquer Rings and Wind's Whisper earrings, which are just as good. Make sure you save some gold as these jewelry pieces often require you to re-roll their stats using Semi-Enigmatic scrolls, which can become quite expensive depending on your luck.

**V. Nexus------------------------------------------**
&gt;Nexus is a zone-wide event that spans across Khanovar Front, Kanstria, and Granarkus. Rifts open at specific areas and spit out 3 waves of increasingly tough monsters. Agnitor faction reputation and credits are rewarded for being present, accepting the quest from the quest-giver, and helping complete each wave of a Nexus rift, with a bonus for completing all three. When the final Nexus in a zone is completed a special raid dungeon opens at that location. In order to enter, you must have been present for at least one final wave of a Nexus rift. This dungeon drops T13/T14 fodder, T13 PvP gear, and sometimes T14 Agnitor gear. In order to enter you must have at least 7 people inside the dungeon, and a drop bonus is provided for every person you bring to a maximum of 20 people. Don't be afraid to join public raids for this dungeon, groups are easy to find and the dungeon itself is not very difficult even with 7 people.

&gt;The gear provided by the Agnitor reputation merchant is almost as good as the dungeon equivalent Abyss gear, and provides you with a safe stepping stone moving from UFL/JT reputation gear towards your Keeper set whether your interests are PvE or PvP. Use this gear to supplement your Abyss set if you are interested in PvE, and if you are interested in PvP then this set is required to construct your Keeper set, Conjunct gear. If you've completed your PvE or PvP gear already, Agnitor reputation is also an excellent way to purchase Master Enigmatic scrolls, which you'll need to MW your Keeper gear.

**VI. Gearing for PvP--------------------------------------**
&gt;Speaking of Conjunct gear, I'll speak briefly on how to properly prepare yourself for PvP in TERA. At endgame, your choices of PvP boil down to one of four options: Open world, Guild vs Guild, Battlegrounds, and 3v3 Arenas. Regardless of which you prefer, you will need the same items in order to prepare for each one. The first thing you must do is queue for battlegrounds. Get used to them, and get used to dying a lot in the process, because you're going to be spending a lot of time in there. The first set of PvP gear, Victor's, is available from Bellicarum reputation merchants located in capital cities all over the world. I would suggest the Headquarters room in Kaiator, because it also features a one-time battleground quest that rewards you with some extra credits.

&gt;Once you've farmed your Victor's set and have stopped dying in one shot to everything, it's time to start farming for the next tier of PvP armor: the Fraywind set. Fraywind armor is enchantable, and it is strongly recommended that you get every single piece to +9. Make sure you purchase your weapon and your chest piece first, these will make the biggest impact on how long you live in battlegrounds and how much damage you deal.

&gt;Attend every single Nexus you can, you'll need a full set of Nexus armor, the weapon,  and a special crafting material from the Agnitor merchant for your Conjunct set. If you have purchased Elite status, make sure you use your Reputation Boost to drastically increase the rewards from the rifts, as well as the repeatable quest to kill the Nexus Traverse Boss.

&gt;Speaking of the Conjunct set, the final tier of PvP gear is called Conjunct gear. In order to craft Conjunct gear, you require full sets of Nexus and Fraywind gear, as well as special crafting materials from both Agnitor as well as Bellicarium. The process is lengthy so I won't get into it here. Once you've created your Conjunct gear, strongly consider Masterworking it and enchanting it to +12, as far as PvP is concerned Conjunct is basically your Keeper set.

**VII. Masterworking-----------------------------------**
&gt;Eventually you'll start to acquire pieces of your Keeper set and start looking to investing a lot of money in making them the best they can be. Part of this process is something called Masterworking, or more simply, being able to enchant your gear from +9 to +12. Masterworking is quite expensive and entire guides have been written specifically for the subject, so I won't get too much into it here.

&gt;Do some research on the topic and do some preparation ahead of time by saving all the Master Enigmatic Scrolls you receive. Masterworking a piece of gear is essentially saying, ""Screw it, I'm done farming gear, this is the last piece for this slot"". Having a set of Masterworked gear feels fantastic, but it does lend a certain finality to playing TERA as you've essentially hit a wall in terms of gear progression. Choose the gear you want to Masterwork wisely, lest you make a horrific investment of money creating an item that is going to be replaced next week.

&gt;In regards to Visionmaker gear, while it is true that these items are the best in the game, they are also insanely hard to acquire. It's okay to Masterwork a Regent weapon instead and put Visionmaker on the shelf as something to deal with in a couple of months. Consider how much time you'll be investing in the game before you tell yourself you're  not going to Masterwork anything until you get your Visionmaker set.

**VIII. Preparing yourself for Hard Modes-------------------------------------**
&gt;Hard Mode dungeons are the real endgame of PvE in TERA. Your choices consist of Crucible of Flame Rank 3, Argon Corpus HM, and Manayas Core HM. These dungeons are not easy, and can wipe even seasoned groups in an instant.

&gt;Getting ready for these dungeons will require some work on your part, both learning what the best items are to have before you try these dungeons as well as the optimal glyph and crystal setups required. I would not recommend attempting a Hard Mode dungeon in TERA without at least a full +9 Nexus set or Abyss set that has the optimal enchantments for your class on it. Having a full set of socketed jewelry is also a good idea before entering a HM dungeon.

&gt;Really this section is devoted to me telling you to learn as much as you can about your class before you try to set foot in ACHM or MCHM. Some of the mechanics present rely heavily on you already understanding most of the mechanics in the Normal Mode equivalent of the dungeon. Other mechanics are in place to punish sub-optimal DPS setups or players that didn't pay enough attention while they were progressing.

That's most of what there is to know about the time you'll be spending in endgame TERA. Compared to launch, there's far more available to keep you occupied for a long time once you hit 60. While this guide is not a complete guide to everything in the game, it's enough to get you started and provide you with appropriate subjects to research once you get around to needing to know them. I'll be forever editing this thing, considering its length, and I'm also considering posting it somewhere more visible and permanent. If you have feedback or further questions, let me know and I'll do my best to get back to you as soon as I can.

1361192861.0,122,self.TeraOnline,18qyhr,[GUIDE] Stuff to remember on your way to 60,136,14,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/18qyhr/guide_stuff_to_remember_on_your_way_to_60/,"There are a lot of things present in TERA that are remnants of previous eras of the game. Some of you new players may not know this, but there are essentially 3 distinct age markers that separate the game's content by patch or expansion. Here they are in summary:

 **Stage One** 
&gt;TERA as was released in Korea. This includes content up to and including Ebon Tower, Labyrinth of Terror, and Kelsaik's Nest. Level range 1-58.

**Stage Two** 
&gt;TERA as was received in North America/Europe. Included the level 60 cap increase, along with the new Fane of Kaprima and Balder's Temple instances. Temple of Temerity followed shortly after.

**Stage Three** 
&gt;Post-TERA:Rising and free-to-play. Includes Argon Corpus and Manaya's Core from post-Stage Two. Introduces Crucible of Flame, Champion's Skyring and any further content to follow.

**-------------------------**
&gt;Unfortunately for you as a new or returning player who has yet to hit the level cap, there are some leftover items and mechanics built into the game from Stage One and Two that can become obstacles for your progress to 60 and Stage Three content. Here is a quick guide to what those items or mechanics are and how to avoid them wasting your time as you progress through the game.

**Tokens**
&gt;You'll collect a variety of these from Zone Quests as you level, sadly they are all basically useless to you:

* [Progress tokens](http://teracodex.com/item/7046)
* [Support tokens](http://teracodex.com/item/6445)
* [Frontline tokens](http://teracodex.com/item/15421)
* [Dedication tokens](http://teracodex.com/item/15420)

**Badges**
&gt;Before hitting 60 you may notice some badges popping up in your inventory as you clear dungeons. These are legacy items from Stage One that were used to purchase gear. Throw them out, it costs way too many badges to purchase anything worthwhile.

* [Oxbow Badge](http://teracodex.com/item/5355)
* [Eldritch Badge](http://teracodex.com/item/19984)
* [Gellid Badge](http://teracodex.com/item/19985)
* [Duality Badge](http://teracodex.com/item/19983)
* [Necrotic Badge](http://teracodex.com/item/19982)
* [Trial Badge](http://teracodex.com/item/19981)

**Rare Items and Crafting Materials**
&gt;There are a few legacy crafting materials you may receive that have fallen out of use. Previously these were used to craft rare endgame gear during Stage One. Nowadays they're just around to confuse you.

* [Beast Hearts](http://teracodex.com/item/8475)
* [Killian's Chain](http://teracodex.com/item/15846)
* [Broken Phoenix Beak](http://teracodex.com/item/15845)
* [Necromancer's Orb Shard](http://teracodex.com/item/15847)

**Unused Crafting Materials**
&gt;You'll find these mats in high level zones, currently there is no use for them. That doesn't mean you should throw them out though!

* [Aether Essence](http://teracodex.com/item/20731)
* [Osyo Fiber](http://teracodex.com/item/20732)
* [Mutated Silex](http://teracodex.com/item/20733)

**Suppression Orders**
&gt;Unless you plan on completing achievements like [these ones](http://i.imgur.com/Se8cIBC.jpg), you shouldn't have to complete suppression orders while you are leveling to 60. If you find yourself running out of things to do in your level range, double check to make sure you have caught up on story quests, BAM quests, and extra quest hubs you may have skipped.

**Golden Labyrinth to Akasha's Hideout**
&gt;One of the first things you'll hear if you ever queue for AH is, ""potion?"". This caused a lot of drama back during launch, and things won't change now. In order to properly complete Akasha's Hideout with a minimum of fuss, you need some of [these, Holy Potions of Protection](http://teracodex.com/item/5347). You can collect these as drops in Golden Labyrinth, which is another dungeon in the same level range as AH. While it's still barely possible to clear AH if one or two people in your party lack the Potion, sometimes it can cause way too much of a hassle.

**Torching Kelsaik**
&gt;During the Story Quests available near 58, you will end up in possession of a [Vessel of the Gods](http://teracodex.com/item/20760). In a nutshell this item is used to make Kelsaik in the Kelsaik's Nest dungeon vulnerable to debuffs and stuns. To power it you will need [Dark Matter](http://teracodex.com/item/20301) which is an item dropped from the final boss in the Ebon Tower instance. If you are already 60 you won't need this item to kill Kelsaik, but those of you attempting to finish the Story Quest at 58 or so may need this item for the extra edge. Combine Dark Matter into the Vessel of the Gods to craft a [Torch of the Gods](http://teracodex.com/item/20761). To use the Torch, point yourself at Kelsaik and activate the item from your inventory or from your hotbar.

**Willpower &amp; Killian**
&gt; When you are clearing Labyrinth of Terror for the Story Quest to kill Killian, pay special attention for [this item](http://teracodex.com/item/20061) to drop off of the bosses. This potion, when consumed, renders you immune to the fear from the second last boss, as well as the fear from the statues that line the outside of the final boss's room. It's not a necessity for clearing the dungeon, but it certainly can make things go a lot faster for you. There is a merchant in Habere who accepts Traces of Fear dropped from mobs around the city in exchange for these same potions.

**Breaking ~~Bad~~ Bhaozurbas**
&gt;The culmination of the level 38 (I think) Story Quest rewards you with a [special item](http://teracodex.com/item/20009). This scroll is used inside of the Cultist's Refuge instance in order to unlock the hidden Argon boss, Bhaozurbas. Try to complete the story quest before you attempt the instance, it's not strictly a necessity but meeting this Argon boss will help you practice for similar BAMs found throughout the rest of the game. Just point yourself at the floating crystal found just before Priestess Akia and activate the scroll.

**Making smart purchases off the broker**
&gt;Depending on your server, chances are there are already quite a few items available for your level range that other players have farmed from dungeons. Unfortunately the price ranges for this gear can sometimes be a little out of sync with those particular item's true values.

&gt;Here is an example: the following two pictures illustrate prices for gear from the same instance.

* [Level 27 Superior enigmatic items](http://i.imgur.com/FIAXHzH.jpg)
* [Level 27 Rare items](http://i.imgur.com/szpkYDB.jpg)

&gt;As you can see, the items levels of both sets of gear are basically the same. The difference is that the Superior set is enigmatic and therefore enchantable. In theory this means that the Superior gear can have better stats than the Rare items. It's not worth your time to invest x3 more gold on a Superior item because:
* First, the cost involved with enchanting the Superior to have equal or better stats isn't worth it.
* Second, this gear will only be relevant until at most level 38 where you will replace it with significantly better gear.

&gt;Don't be a sucker and waste your money on items like those Superior pieces, you're going to need every piece of gold you have once you hit level 60. Shop smart!

**Crafting, done right**
&gt;It's going to be tempting while you are leveling to try your hand at crafting. The sad news I have for you is that this hobby is largely sidelined in TERA (with the exception of Alchemy). The easiest way to level a crafting skill to 410 is through the following method:

* [Accept crafting quest from any Mission Board](http://i.imgur.com/8wVHWYF.jpg)
* [Visit the quest NPC who provides you with some materials and a design](http://imgur.com/85ndu7U)
* [Purchase extra materials and craft the relevant item](http://imgur.com/Rc6p9Ht)
* [Return the quest](http://imgur.com/RFQK0GL)
* [Repeat](http://imgur.com/IY66Ug7)

&gt;Using this method costs you a small amount of gold in comparison to purchasing expensive runes or materials to try and afford the somewhat ridiculous material cost for crafting items. Once your crafting skill is up to 410 you are ready to craft Visionmaker gear designs, but you'll need to be 60 before you can start worrying about that. You can also pick up extra designs off of the broker, just be warned these designs have never been modified since launch so they can be pretty expensive to collect materials for.

**Other things**
&gt;There are other things I can get into that entire guides have been written about already. I believed I've covered most of the more dangerous pitfalls you can fall into during your quest for 60. Make sure you bookmark this guide, if something crosses my mind that should have been included here I will update the guide accordingly. If you have any questions, comments, or ideas to be included share them below and I will credit you accordingly as the guide is updated.

Six hours past the original window, we've decided to forego updating the platform as we'd prefer our current players be able to continue in the Head Start event.

We're now in the process of bringing the servers back online and will have another update within the hour. We sincerely thank you for bearing with us.

We'll have a proper news post up in a few minutes.

EDIT 2: The forums are back up with the servers soon to follow.

EDIT 3: The servers are back up and can be accessed.

1336472205.0,94,self.TeraOnline,tcqi2,TERA is the first MMORPG to get me excited in years...and I work in marketing. It's nice to be reminded I have a pulse. Anyone else think they were over MMORPGs/gaming and have been pleasantly surprised?,115,21,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/tcqi2/tera_is_the_first_mmorpg_to_get_me_excited_in/,"Last night I got TERA, spent far too long creating my character, and then ventured into the prologue. 

I made an Elin Warrior because, while it may be slightly emasculating, I find I relate more to the adorable cat girl as opposed to the steroid man-hulk-thing they call humans.

I have to admit initially I wasn't amazed; in fact I kind of thought to myself that the world looked a lot like Aion. 

Instead of reading about TERA like I had previously with other MMORPGs I just went with it. I ignored most articles and posts and just thought I'll honestly just give it a go. So I had no real expectations other than I knew it was a pretty MMORPG.

After the prologue I felt a bit...well a bit underwhelmed. TERA didn't set itself apart from anything I had played prior and I didn't feel particularly interested in the world lore. 

New island, conflict, hit things. 

It wasn't exactly groundbreaking but then I started to notice little things. Mainly the whole avoiding attacks aspect. Up until I started actually leveling I had not realised that I could actually weave in and out of attacks. I had assumed it was all stat based and because of this up until my discovery I had played it like any other game. 

Run up, spam rotation, leap away.

Once I discovered this I spent a rather large amount of time simply testing the extent of this. I wanted to know just how much I could avoid simply by running in between attacks. I then started to find combat highly enjoyable because the damage I was taking was due to my inability to avoid being hit by enemy attacks.

In previous games I had always been annoyed by the randomness of taking damage. Even if I ran behind an enemy they manage to keep laying their hits on me if I had hate/threat/enmity. 

So when I found out that everything became essentially my fault I loved it. TERA gives you something a lot of games don't and that is accountability for your actions. As opposed to running up to an enemy and spamming everything I have; fights are now an intricate dance of dodge the hell out of everything because it's fun. 

In most MMORPGs I suffered from what I'm going to dub as combat avoidance syndrome, which is now a thing, where I did my best to avoid combat with enemies as it was usually a chore. 

With combat such an enjoyment I actually took more of an active interest in the storyline, why I'm slaughtering everything, and why these questbots want me commit genocide. 

So much so I started another character, a human slayer, and roped my housemate into trying the game. As a result I'm now sat in work, cup of tea in hand, and feel like crap. Because we didn't sleep and we rocked up every starter quest, watched every cutscene, and listened to what everyone had to say.


It was glorious and yes I will doing exactly that all over again tonight.


Coincidentally if you're on Samael we should be friends. (Couldn't get onto Essenia)

----------

**TL;DR: I thought I was over MMORPGs but I liked this enough to play it. Also, God damn everything is so pretty.**

I have to say, the group PvP was not what i expected as an archer. I was expecting to be able to kite lancers around, 2 shot priests/sorc, and use traps...

None of these things were possible, except being able to 3 shot clothies (one extra shot big whoop). Lancers have some incredible sustainability, even without healers. And kiting them is ALMOST impossible. I started to get the hang of it there at the end... but still, they are straight up powerhouses. And TRAPS, so far the stun ones dont stay up long enough to be of any use, as they disappear to quickly, and take FOREVER to put down. No way youre getting one down in the middle of a fight. Now that i got those cons out of the way, lets talk about how fun it is to PvP as an archer. The sweetest victory i have had yet is my very first duel, was with a slayer both @ 32. It was such a close fight, and he would have had me if i didnt dodge his Vert slash at the perfect moment, and chain into my charged Pen arrow critting him for 5k, and dropping him. Anyways, I was just bored and was reflecting on OB. And you guys know i was just fucking with slayers. In the right hands those things are blenders of straight up death.

Links and Info inside.,96,10,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/u12os/tera_ui_issue_needs_attention_no_developer/,"The issue has been narrowed down by the community to the UI which uses the AutoDesk Scaleform UI.    
http://gameware.autodesk.com/scaleform    
       
Basically the UI isn't being rendered by the GPU and is hogging most the CPUs resources causing a CPU bottleneck. The GPU usage for most including me is around 30-50% at even the most intense moments in the game and having the settings at lowest or highest settings make no difference in the FPS. If people hide parts of their UI their FPS gets a bit better for each part hidden. And if people hide their UI completely (Ctrl + Z) peoples FPS doubles/triples and the GPU usage goes to 70-100%. The issue apparently didn't exist in Close Beta and was introduced during Open Beta/Head Start. The Scaleform UI is capable of Multicore and GPU rendering so it should just be a matter of enabling GPU rendering or something along those lines. I just know that this is hindering many peoples enjoyment of the game including mine. As fun as tanking 60 dungeons is with no UI it'd be nice to see my HP and stuff....

I understand the game is still new and I'm sure the developers are busy getting content ready. But there is a large UI issue that is plaguing many people and there has yet to be a single response acknowledged by a moderator or anyone that can get the word to the devs. This same issue happened in Batman: Arkham City and was fixed with a patch so we know it's fixable... The Devs just need to know it's a problem.

Here is a list of just a few of these post. The largest one being on the Tera EU forums and is the most active and largest post there (300+ post)

Not long ago highly active and very knowledgeable people got banned for ridiculous reasons from the forums, that rules should have been broken from other users as well dozens of times already. And this seems to continue until everybody who's doubting Gameforges ability to handle the game properly has left the forum or the game.

So here I got banned for a ridiculous, not even existent, reason. Since I'm just pointing out the truth/whats happening right now, because I'm not at all pleased of it (since I'm even paying for the TERA Club, which is Elite status in NA)

http://abload.de/img/banspxukq.jpg

Don't get me wrong. GF is terrible, but I wouldnt care about the 12 hours (on a Friday btw... evening till saturday morning) if there would be a statement, apology, explanation. But it just doesn't happen. And TERA doesn't happen with GF. You're sitting there in the forums, searching for a solution. People trying everything, getting no responses, reinstalling their game. And GF either doesn't know the problem because they're sleeping or they (more likely) don't care.

I know it's kind of a lost hope, but I would love EME to take over TERA EU. Point out the situation to BHS. GF is ruining the TERA community. GF isn't listening to us and shutting us (the loudest voies) out of the community. I don't know how to save this game if I can't even write my opinion anymore (I will recreate a new account anyways, since permaban).

    intro_atari.bik

They are located in  *\Client\S1Game\CookedPC\Art_Data\Packages\Video*

----------------------------

* **Enhance Game Field of Vision [\(FOV\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Of_View_in_Video_Games)**

In the **S1Input.ini**, add the following lines, **exactly as shown**, under the *bEnableMouseSmoothing* entry:

*Bindings=(Name=""end"",Command=""fov 90"")*

*Bindings=(Name=""home"",Command=""fov 71"")*

(END Key enables FOV 90, HOME Key restores the game to default FOV 71.)

---------------------------------------------

* **Disable Mouse Smoothing**

While you have the S1Input.ini file open, change:

bEnableMouseSmoothing=True

to:

bEnableMouseSmoothing=*False*

(This change might improve mouse responsiveness on your system.)

---------------------------

* **Gain some Frames per Second and lose the smeared Vaseline look in game**

In the game's Video Options, reduce **Lighting Enrichment** setting to 1. 

This will disable FXAA, the game's anti-aliasing system which causes blurriness and font fuzziness.

(I force MSAA via my GPU software, and get better performance than the in game FXAA.)

-------------------

* **Improve Font legibility!**

Navigate to the *TERA\Client\S1Game\Localization\USA* folder.

Rename the GFxUI into something else.

Going up one folder and enter the INT folder.

Copy *both* files from there and paste them into the USA folder.

Rename the ExampleGame.int and GFxUI.int into ExampleGame.usa and GFxUI.usa, respectively.

(Reverse your actions if you don't like it.)

[Tip of the Hat to **Alleriya**](https://forum.tera-europe.com/showthread.php?t=85660)

Font example [screenie](http://i.imgur.com/UV9gijb.jpg).

If you are a Tera-EU player, use the TERA\Client\S1Game\Localization\EUR folder, and not USA folder.  **(Thanks abialystok)**

-----------------

* **Unlock the games frame rate**

Depending on your system, turning off the FPS throttle in the game may improve your FPS.

Go into S1Engine.ini and change:

bSmoothFrameRate=True

to:

bSmoothFrameRate=*False*

---------------------------

Use common sense when editing ini files, back up copies in another folder to be extra safe, and don't fat finger it or inject typos or your results might suck.

**Skill Summary**

Level 60 Slayer here, you have 3 main skills that are essential.

1. Whirlwind- This is a high damage skill and is actually the hardest hitting skill you have IF you land both spins

2. Heart Thrust- This is your main damage skill, it does huge amounts of damage and is ideally comboed with overpower, which will increase damage (and once you have the right glyphs crit chance and the reset glyph)

3. Knockdown strike- This has a very high knockdown rate against everything (even BAMS occasionally) and helps you put out A LOT of damage when things are on the ground.

These three skills are your combo *starters*, you use them to begin a new combo. All of these skills combo into Overhand Strike, which is where a lot of your damage comes from.

Other skills include

1. Overhand Strike- A lot of damage especially with reset glyph which is pretty essential, combos well after... everything (Tip:If you are leveling solo get the 3% hp on overhand strike glyph, saves on bandages and can save you in a close fight)

2. Startling Kick- This skill is primarily used as an interrupt during a big animation from a BAM OR when your main three combo starters are on cooldown.

3. Stunning Backhand- Same as above, use it to interrupt an animation or when your other main skills are on cooldown

4. Retaliate- Use it when you get knocked down to get up faster and potentially knock things down around you (Tip: Occasionally something will knock you down 2 or more times in a short time period, so don't get up immediately if you know you will get knocked right back down, because they you can't get up fast)

5. Leaping Strike- Use this when something gets knocked down for damage or as a gap closer

6. Distance Blade- Use it as a gap closer, it does decent damage too

7. Backstab- You get his at 56 and just use it to get behind the target and temporarily immobilize them, after using them start with one of your combo skills

8. In Cold Blood- Unlocked at 58 you simply use this for a large power boost, use it right before you start a big combo (good for burning BAMS)

9. Overpower- This literally adds 30% extra damage onto your next skill, which is huge, use it before WW, HT ideally

10. Evade-This is an invincibility frame, meaning that when there is a HUGE AoE skill that is about to destroy everything around you, jump out of it, or through it while it goes off, avoiding all damage. More or less just do what the name implies and evade things with it

11. Headlong Rush- Use this to avoid some skills and also you can use it to set up a WW or a KDS faster

12. Dash- Use it to run faster during combat, good for avoiding things/running away when needed

13. Triumphant Shout/Tenacity- Use them for mana

14. Measured Slice- This is your 60 skills, and casts faster after overhand strike, which as we know casts faster after pretty much everything. This skill is your hardest hitting skill, and is pretty easy to land, so try to land it


**Combos**

As I already said, your main three combo starters are HT, WW, and KDS. So a good combo will typically look like this:

(optional) Cold Blood&gt;Overpower&gt;HT&gt;OHS&gt; (Once 60) Measured Slice

(optional) Cold Blood&gt;Overpower&gt;WW&gt;OHS&gt; (Once 60) Measured Slice

KDS&gt; (If knocked down) Leaping Strike&gt; (Skip straight here if not knocked down) OHS&gt; (Once 60) Measured Slice

Startling Kick&gt; OHS&gt; (Once 60) Measured Slice

Stunning Backhand&gt; OHS&gt; (Once 60) Measured Slice


The important thing to note about slayer is **be flexible**. These combos all work and work well, but if using the combo will let a BAM get a strong attack off onto you DON'T DO IT. Play the hit and run style. Use combos when you can, but an individual HT before using an evade to the side is fine too if it means you don't get hit by anything.

Personal Favorite Combo:

Overpower&gt;HT&gt;OHS&gt;Measured&gt;WW&gt;OHS&gt;KDS &gt;Leaping Strike&gt;OHS&gt;
(If up) HT&gt; Startling Kick/Stunning Backhand&gt; auto/run and wait for cooldowns

This seems like a really long combo (and it is) but this should give you an idea of what playing slayer should be like, put out lots of damage when possible, but I will just as often switch the KDS and WW parts so KDS comes sooner in the combo, or I may lead with a headlong rush&gt;WW and use HT later. It all depends on the situation, which is where you need to decide what to use. 

**Glyphs/Crystals/Tips**

Solo leveling crystals: Vigorous armor crystals and Brilliant weapon crystals will help you with mana problems (which you often will have starting fights) and health problems (seriously the regen is so worth it)

Dungeons (monsters): hunters weapons crystals and stalwart armor crystals, this increases damage output against mobs and reduces damage taken, which make your healer happy

Dungeons (BAMs): Savage, Acrimonious, Focused, and Carving weapon crystals and anarchic armor crystals, this will increase your damage output FRO BEHIND, so get behind targets (backstab is good for this) and reduces damage from BAMs, which is necessary if you don't want your party to say: tank: heal please  healer: srry, shit slayer needs lots of heals

Powerful Zyrks should be used whenever possible (not until you have jewelery slots though). Also crystals get expensive, so buy crystalbind or when you drop 100g buying a new crystal you will wish you only spent 20 and got the crystalbind instead.

Glyphs are largely preferenced based, however some essential ones include:

All three heart thrust glyphs, one of them is a master glyph and costs more though.

Glyph of carving for whirlwind, this triples your crit rate, however it is also a mater glyph

overhand strike 50% eliminate cd (get master glyph is possible, but not a priority)

Glyph of carving on measured slice (not a masterwork YAY) and glyph of power us good but optional

Glyph of carving on overpower (unfourtunately another masterwork glyph)

One last important tip is to make sure that you aren't in front of the BAM if you don't have to be, slayer is the only melee class with no block, so don't play like you have one.

A great resource that helped me lots is a [a slayer guide from Tera forums](http://tera-forums.enmasse.com/forums/slayer/topics/GUIDE-Brolys-Slayer-Guide?page=1)

**TL;DR: If you are currently playing slayer or want to learn actually read this, it's helpful.**

Edit: Once you are getting close to level 60 people have different ideas on what gear is good to buy as a new 60, some people say your first full set should be Abyss (tier14), others say it should be T13 gear, which is cheaper and just used until you can afford better gear (I.E. Regents set). If you are not an elite player and are just f2p/founder it is probably better to use a T13 set and +9 it, but if you do have elite I would recommend saving your gold and buying Jax Trust gear, which you unlock with daily credits. It will take 1800 credits from there, and therefore about 10-14 days of daily quests, but the gear is very good and will let you hold onto your cash to save up for a regents set.",,False,self,t5_2s527,1361482210.0,,,True,t3_18xyjs,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/18xyjs/basic_slayer_information/,

1338299832.0,57,self.TeraOnline,uabjn,What TERA needs to survive and grow long-term.,73,16,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/uabjn/what_tera_needs_to_survive_and_grow_longterm/,"First off, everything here is **my opinion**.  I by no means speak for anyone other than myself, nor am I claiming that the game will falter if any or all of these suggestions aren't considered.  I just wanted to generate some discussion as to what the game needs to be a long-term successful MMO.  These are of course my suggestions.


* GvG is really fun and it's one of the aspects that separates TERA from other games. However, fun simply for the sake of being fun can only last so long when there are so many competing games.  What GvG needs is incentives and long-term goals.  Wars should last longer than a simple 24 hours, because that window really doesn't provide much room for things to heat up.  Right now, all that's at stake is your guild's reputation (if even that)...and with how many guild wars are going on, who really is keeping track of all of the winners/losers anyways?  Do you **really** care if your guild wins or loses?  Maybe a little, but probably not as much as you should.  I believe that the winner in the GvG should reap some form of reward.  Guilds should *want* to win and guilds should hate losing.  What GvG needs is a real competitive draw.  That's how rivalries are formed and that really would be the first step forwards bringing GV to the next level.  However, rewards need to be **meaningful**...not just some simple fluff or tacky rewards which don't add up to much.


* I think that EME and Bluehole could take a page from both DAoC and EVE Online's PvP systems and work on some form of adaptation that can apply to the TERA world.  Just imagine this combat system combined with open-world castle sieges, wars over land and resources, special-access areas (such as Darkness Falls in DAoC) for taking over specific land, etc.  I think that they could potentially mesh very well with the Vanarch system.  I believe that a robust system such as thing would take a long time to implement properly, but it would fit within the game's style very, very well.  **This** is something that would honestly bring TERA to a whole new level, as it would provide tons of replayability and longevity to the end-game.


* Raids.  Not everyone loves raids, and I am one of them.  They can be large time sinks and they're certainly not for everyone.  Due to collision detection and TERA's combat system, a raid can be a difficult thing to implemented properly.  Still, I think that difficult 10-man or 20-man PvE raids would provide a lot of longevity for the game's PvE players.  5-mans can only hold interest for so long because the scope is much smaller and they don't require a total guild effort.  With TERA's mechanics, raids can be made to be very difficult without the need to make them total grindfests.  Raids would really help solidify long-term PvE guilds.


* Simply put, TERA needs long term goals and objectives for players to work towards.  There should always be a few months worth of end-game content out there, with new stuff constantly on the horizon to keep players looking forward.  EME needs to communicate with the player base very well so that the players are always aware that bigger things are on the horizon.


* Difficult achievements and vanity/aesthetic awards.  Achievements and vanity awards always provide great ""side"" things to work on, especially when playing solo.  In WoW, I recall spending plenty of time working on achievements for various rewards, hunting the rare Time Lost Proto Drake for the mount, grinding meaningful reputation for rare rewards, etc.  TERA already offers some of this to a degree - but more is always better!  I would even suggest guild and player housing, as they're fun timesinks to allow players to show off their achievements.


* A little more class customization would be nice.  Each class is very unique as it is, and all have very different playstyles.  However, one small issue is that you aren't very unique compared to people playing your class.  My Lancer is really no different than any other Lancer.  My Sorcerer is no different than anyone else's Sorcerer.  This is OK because of how wildly different classes are - but it would be nice to open up some more customization.  Glyphs are a great start, but I do feel that a little more customization could go a long way if balance can be maintained.


* The Vanarch system needs to have more to it.  Right now...basically Vanarch can disable vendors, disable PvP, and adjust taxrates to an extend.  That's not much to do, and I have a feeling that outside of guilds that are running for office, nobody is really going to care.  Player X and Y aren't going to care much if some vendors are missing or if they have to pay a few extra silver to use the healer.  I think that the Vanarchs should have a lot more control over the region.  Perhaps this can tie in with some of my prior suggestions?

This is long, okay!

I've played kTera (without understanding much of what was being said for the longest time) and started playing on the USA servers recently. I've acquired a level 60 Priest after some two weeks of casual play and wish to present some party/raiding etiquette 101 because I notice a lot of newer players lacking knowledge in this department. 

I've played as a healer for a very long time in various MMORPG's. I've been in some of the top guilds since Vanilla WoW, Ragnarok (though the concept of tanking and healing is far different), Aion, Rift, kTera, Flyff (I was young and needed something simple coughflyffcoughorriblegamecoughstayawaycough) and now I'm working my way up the reputable ladder of Tera USA. I'm going to share my experiences with you because I've noticed with the exception of only TWO MMORPG's I've played (Ragnarok online and Guild Wars 2) that there are standard mechanics people can follow in order to succeed in dungeons.  I feel that with this subreddit garnering a lot of attention from the game recently going F2P that I should provide some general insight from my personal experiences. 


Lastly, the main points I'd like to stress in this guide involve partying successfully to overcome various obstacles regardless of the difficulty with the utilization of common sense and standard in-game mechanics which exist for the sole purpose of making your life in dungeons and raids easier.


I will include diagrams drawn by yours truly with my mediocre paint abilities to provide visual examples.


What are these aspects I speak of? 


* Dodging and parrying (certain DPS)
* Memorizing attack patterns
* Positioning
* Stacking
* Moving in unison
* Killing ADD's.
* Backing out when necessary.
* Telling everyone it's your first time in a dungeon or raid.
* Taking advantage of other players experience through thoroughly written guides and videos posted throughout the internet
* Notes


Lets begin.

**Dodging:** Every class has a dodge or a back step. Some classes have a way to defend themselves further from oncoming attacks (I'm lookin' at you, zerkers, warriors, and lancers). There should be no reason for any class to take on excess damage. Excess damage means more mana spent on healing, which puts a strain on healers when they should be conserving themselves for more desperate situations, not for situations that can be avoided. I like to call this problem preventing.


Once again, healing takes time. A second can make the difference from wiping and/or unnecessary deaths that could have been avoided.


**Attack Patterns:** Every. Creature. In. This. Game. Has. An. Attack. Pattern. With that said, every enemy in EVERY MMORPG has an attack pattern period. After a few minutes, generally you'd have the gist of it. Observing the boss you're fighting instead of mindlessly mashing buttons as if it were just another mob, preventing unnecessary damage by DODGING will make your life and everyone else's life easy. 


By the time you hit 60 you should have a very clear understanding of your class in dungeons. There should be no exception to this rule for anyone who's hit 60, regardless of how you got there -- unless, of course, someone else leveled that toon for you. 


And with leveling comes experience -- not experience that you need to level, but experience with mobs, monsters, bosses, et cetera. You generally refight the same BAM's and bosses over and over again with few exceptions (which will be highlighted later on). You should be able to look at all the mobs in Ebon Tower, Crucible of Flame, and whatnot and say to yourself, ""Damn, these bosses feel familiar"".


Which is why you should be able to DODGE and AVOID unnecessary damage.


I can tell you that Mystics, Sorcs, and Priests have a back step and teleports/more back-step with slows and kiting potential which allow us to get out of sticky situations. I've seen great DPS avoid major damage all-together when 2-manning Ebon Tower (myself and the DPS) for M.E.S.. 


**Positioning:** This is very important as well. There's no reason a healer should have to chase you to the other side of the room and remove themself from range of the tank and other party members because you're unnaware of your surroundings and position yourself far away from the group and the healer. You should ALWAYS be in range of your tank and healer. I can't tell you how many lives could have been saved with proper positioning. I tire of seeing disgusting accusations because you're in San Francisco when everyone else is in Texas.


Healing takes time. Sometimes we suffer extreme damage in our fights. From experience, Priests have strong AOE heals that can bring a party from the brink of life up to par in a mere second with target-able healing (3 when glyphed, 2 when not) that can also save you from death. If there's something healers have to purge, life is much easier when they can instantly click and purge a group instead of running around to target everyone.


With the utilization of dodging, memorization of attack patterns, and proper positioning, even the most difficult of dungeons should be clear able. Yes, there is ilevel to consider and there exist people with characters so powerful that these points can almost be avoided -- up until you enter the TRUE end-game of Tera, Hard Mode Dungeons, but for the most part, even if it's a breeze for players, these procedures should be commonly practiced until they become habit. 


Positioning for the melee DPS should be to the side or behind the boss, between the healer and the tank forming an acute angle of the party. For the most party, healers shouldn't be taking any sort of severe damage at all. Range DPS should be somewhere near the healer to avoid any unnecessary close-range damage, and the tank should be facing the boss away from the group entirely. 


**Stacking:** This one is my favorite. Stacking is a concept that's existed in MMORPG's for a very long time. DPS will stack in Point A, usually behind or to the side of the boss to avoid any frontal damage while the tank stands at Point B taking the brute of the force for the team and maintaining aggro. It makes me so happy when damage is dealt to my party members and I can throw an AOE Heal into the group to top them off before they even notice that their HP was cut in half. 


This makes it easier for you to continue with DDPSing the boss (Dealing Damage Per Second) and for me to heal you and the tank to transition back into steady tank'n'spank after purging you of whatever ails you. Mystic's have a target-able purge (2 without glyph, 3 with glyph) and Priests have an AoE purge that targets up to 15 raid members (if I remember correctly). Yes, purging becomes easier, even single targeting becomes easier. Positioning yourself in range of the tank (so that he may grab aggro) and near your healer (so that you may live through excessive damage) makes partying a pleasure, instead of having everyone disoriented and running around like a chicken with its head cut off. 


**Moving in unison:** This is a concept I learned in Ragnarok and I refined in World of Warcraft. Basically the idea is to move together and position yourselves thoughtfully. In World of Warcraft, when a boss makes a certain motion to highlight the impending strike of an awful attack or to summon adds, the party re positions itself to avoid this moments before the attack is launched, mitigating the brute of the attack or completely avoiding it while preparing themselves to receive lovely healing from their priests. The add's are usually killed the moment they're spawned or kited to death by ranged DPS (in Tera, that's Sorc's, Archers), and seldom touch the healer, allowing the healer to focus on their objective -- which is to keep the party and raid alive. 


Even if you may not get this to work in pugs or random people you'll tackle an instance and raid with, even a few people abiding by this will take plenty of stress off of the healer. Practice this until it becomes habit. 


**Killing ADD's:** Add's is a term used for minions spawned during fights which target whatever grabs aggro first. In most cases, this is the healer. In WoW, there's an off-tank and in Tera there's an off-tank for this as well, which focus on add control. The moment add's are spawned there should be no reason in the world that they should ever reach your healer. If your healer has to kite said adds and suffers damage which forces the healer to focus heal themselves and/or inevitably die which may cause the tank or dps to die and eventually wipe, that is due to sheer negligence. Moral of this point is that you shouldn't let minions reach your healer. Ever. 


**Backing out when necessary:** We've all seen that one guy who takes x amount of damage and isn't healed instantly because of reasons who decides to stay in the fight a bit too long and dies. Often they decide to ridicule the healer or the tank but the truth of the matter is that you should have just backed out. Walk away for a moment to get topped off. Normally when I'm raiding or doing dungeons this only happens to people who aren't positioned well at all. They lack map awareness and despite knowing they're a good distance from the healer, insist on staying in the fight only to inevitably die. Don't be that guy. 

Never be that guy.

**Taking time to tell everyone that it's your first time in a dungeon or raid:** This. This a thousand times. You can avoid so many problems by having a more experienced person in your party explain proper procedure. You should listen intently and learn from their experience. There is NO shame in telling your party that this is your first time in a dungeon.

**And lastly -- Taking advantage of other players experience through thoroughly written guides and videos posted throughout the internet:** In World of Warcraft our raid leaders spent a lot of time linking us videos and taking a moment to enlighten us on the boss fight. As a raid leader, they were obligated to inform their raid about how to defeat the oncoming obstacle instead of wasting everyone's time because a few people didn't do their homework. There's NO shame in taking a few minutes to do your homework and study a video and/or a guide on the upcoming fight to successfully progress on the boss until you eventually down it. 

There's guides posted all over the internet and Google is your best friend. Please utilize these guides to prepare yourself and those around you for the oncoming obstacles. 

**Notes:** You should always know where your healer is. I learned this concept from MOBA games through the superiority of map-awareness and it was refined upon in WoW. In Raids it's common practice to **mark** your healer with an icon, which becomes visible to EVERYONE in the raid. Very important to consider. 

Gather for buffs and charms around a campfire before every boss. You want to go in full-force, not half assed. 

Healers should learn to use their technique to gather mana.

Healers should manage their mana. Don't needlessly heal a target that does not need healing. Don't be that healer which uses a healing spell because someone took 1/20th of damage. 

Healers should practice what's known as ""Preventive Healing"". It's a concept in which the healer uses HOT's (Heals Over Time) to prevent too much damage on their raid members. Mystics have HOT's imbued in their target heals. Priests have AoE Ground Heals and Regeneration Circle on a fairly long cool down for Preventive Healing. 


Mystics should make note to remind players in their party or raid to use their orbs when necessary as a safety precaution. I hate when party members don't pick up orbs from Mystics. They can be life savers.

Priests should use Kaia's Shield in emergency situations. It's a life saver. It will prevent a lot of wipes. It's an absorption shield on a fairly long cool down. Scarcely and wisely are the operative words here. 

The use of steroids is encouraged (but not IRL). The word steroid in video games defines a move that temporarily alters attack speed and/or damage for a short period of time. Priests have one. It's called Energy Stars: This is a lock-on skill and is the only priest skill that can be used while moving. If the monster has received damage from the skill, all party members within 18m range of the monster will receive a special buff for 15 seconds: +X Strength, 5% Increased Attack Speed. Use it every moment it's off cool-down.

With all this said, I'm sure that you there are exceptions to certain fights in which some of these aren't applicable to a T but for the most part these are guidelines that will assist you in overcoming your battles as a party. Please add any inputs in the comments I'll gladly edit them in and provide credit.  I hope you enjoyed the long read. 


Thank you for reading and see you on Tera.

Edit: 

**This is for advice given by other players**

**OrangesAreApples:** Be responsive. I cannot stand it when someone don't reply to questions or answers questions. It's tough. Especially when I say I am new, then nothing is explained. Or folks who go in and never says they new. Or people who rushes. Etc. Communication is key.

**Deylar419:** If you're DPS, please, for the love of God, let the Tank pull. I don't know how many times I've lost a party member or two because I'm kiting the mobs that I pulled by healing the member who decided he could generate more threat than a tank or healer. The only role that generates more threat than a healer, is a tank. So please, again, do NOT pull the room unless you're a tank who can taunt them off the healer.


Note: Going off of this, healers: Do NOT heal before you see the Tank use his taunt. His combo attack doesn't generate the threat that his Taunt does and your heal will pull aggro off him. I learned this the hard way.

**b3thanie:** Don't forget that its nice to always have Stam pots on you incase of a death. No one wants to wait around for you to gain stam.",,False,self,t5_2s527,1361629301.0,,lancer,True,t3_190hrn,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/190hrn/a_dungeonraidingpartying_etiquette_guide_for/,

Hello redditors,

Our fansite, TERAToday.com, is a community fansite for TERA Online with the goal to provide the most up-to-date resources to players such as game guides, news articles and other player-created content. Our user community and player resources continue to grow, but there are still plenty of topics that need to be covered (and it doesn't only have to be guides), and we need your help!

Top priority topics that still need to be covered include the following:

* Lancer PvE
* PvP guides for basically everything but Zerk/Lancer/Slayer
* Dungeon guides for every instance except ToT/Nexus/SJG

We are now getting over 6,000 visitors a day. That's over 6,000 people that you could be helping everyday! There are also a number of benefits to having content hosted by us, such as having full HTML functionality and formatting to create and maintain great looking guides, high search rankings for your content (all of our current stuff ranks extremely well on search engines!) and the ability to collaborate with others, among many others. Whether for the publicity or if you would just like to lend a helping hand to the site and the community, please let us know in the comments, or [contact us!](http://teratoday.com/contact)

Speaking of publicity, we are now allowing guide authors to do a bit of guild advertising if you so choose. We are allowing 1-2 sentences for you to advertise your guild, and it must be approved first for it to appear at the top of your guide.

Here is our current list of guides:

They don't allow pay to win options in the cash shop, they keep spammers and scammers out of global, and they reward those who previously paid and played by giving them more avail-abilities in the game.

How do I know this?

Aion Online was exactly the same.

Aion was struggling 6 months down the line after being pay to play. Not just financially, but the servers were pretty much empty (They even merged servers quite early on because of lack of people).

At this point, the MMO market was changing, and Aion was one of the first premium titles to go free to play... and to be fair, it worked.

Now newcomers to the game are enjoying it, and so are the veterans. The game is thriving with new players, and the chat remained the same as it was before it went free to play.

Tera will be exactly the same. Newcomers will play, there will be busy starter areas for the first month or so, but YOUR game will not change.

TL;DR: Don't listen to complainers in the global chat, F2P Tera will allow the game to thrive and grow more than it was able to on it's pay to play model.

Expect numerous patches and content updates in the coming months.

He is the only toon Ive played so far. Well I was walking though the woodland zone and I was walling across this bridge where there were 2 guilds having a stare down.
Well I guess what happened was 2 people from each guild were having a dispute and wanted to GvG but the one guy was scared. They were calling eachother out for abt 10 min and I was just standing around. Now I'm only a lvl 15/16 and these guys were all like 45 and 48 and stuff. So wayyy higher than me. 
But there was one guy who was talkin to me the whole time. He was very nice to me. I ended up askin him if I could join a guild. And he inved me no questions asked. It was really nice. I've never played an mmo before and I never thought id be asked to join a guild. And this guild is pretty big. I felt really good. So anyway this argument settled and we all went our different ways. 
Later (abt 20 min later) I was killing some big spor guys. And there was someone with infamy around. He was way higher lvl than me. Abt 30 I think. This guy tried to sneak up on me for an easy kill while I was trying to kill this spor and all the sudden he dropped dead. I turn around and there was a guild mate there. He had killed this guy that was abt to kill me. He didn't have too. But he did. And it was really nice of him. Anyway I found out later that the guy who killed the dude tryin to kill me was the guild master.
So I guess my point of this is. I really like the TERA community. Sure there are some dicks. But I think there is a lot of really cool chill people too

So if anyone from my guild reads this. Thanks :-)",,False,self,t5_2s527,False,,,True,t3_tbbpb,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/tbbpb/just_a_story_about_something_that_made_me_happy/,

What they do is leech your help for the first 3 bosses, then kick you before the final boss so that they get all of the good loot like VM designs.

So I was in a party with Sekui, Mystic.Sky, Zyra.Leen, and Yuzurihaa. We're running acnm, and they're all queued together(I know this because they're all from Flame of Glory.)

Before the last boss, one of their guys tells me they'll brb because they have to help their mother with something. I was in a hurry to catch nexus, but I told them I'd be polite and wait.

So I choose to be nice and wait a minute so that he can do his thing, and they call a votekick and remove me. The guy didn't actually have to go brb, he just needed me to avoid starting combat so that they could votekick me(you can't kick within 2 minutes of combat). I wasted so much time AND a dungeon cooldown because of them. They just used me to get past the early bosses faster, then kicked me so that they get all the drops that are actually valuable.

In an attempt to learn absolutely everything about my class and Tera in general I went searching for an elitist jerks style community based around Tera...

I failed to find anything decent or anything on the level of elitism that I’m aiming for... So with that in mind, years of MMO experience and years of doing amateur web design I set out to create a forum...

A home for all the Tera elitists, theorycrafters and enthusiasts, additionally a place for all who want to learn more about their class and better their skills in Tera.

I’m hoping that by sharing this with you guys we can turn it from an empty forum into a thriving information hub for all serious Tera players.

Edit (03/05/12):
Wow, I didn't expect so many comments! I'll do my best to answer everyone, apologies if I miss anything...

Clearly there are some issues with the post background texture lol. I'm working on changing that at the moment and should hopefully have something much better in place by the end of today.

Metnavman, I know what you mean, it is difficult to have an elitist site with a serious lack of info on the DPS/HPS. However there's still a lot that can be discussed / improved on, for example we can't get exact spell rotations down but we can definitely do priority lists for cooldowns. Plus as you mentioned there's quite a few people failing. If those people happen upon our site they can potentially stop sucking. :P As for the things you'd love to see, boss abilities/interrupts will be posted in guides in the PvE section and useful class tips will be in the appropriate class forums. On top of that who knows what EnMasse will do in the future, may as well have the community ready for any serious theorycrafting.

I don't just want TE to be about number crunching, I'm aiming for it to be a community for all serious Tera players, an information hub, a compendium on all things Tera, etc.

Praskovya, my apologies for posting inferior guides that are thriving with stupidity. In truth I've only really played zerker properly and I'm far from ready to write a guide on zerkers yet. Thus I don't know a great deal about the other classes yet and when I saw the guides I thought they'd be a good starting point. I'm hoping people will post in the guide threads and explain that they're fail / write their own decent guides so I can get rid of them.

fingertrollin, I hadn't even thought of that, will add a crafting section today.

GnomeSerial, thanks for the add to the side bar!!! :)

Also thank you to everyone who has joined TE and started posting. :)",,False,self,t5_2s527,True,,,True,t3_t10fk,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/t10fk/an_elitisttheorycrafting_tera_community/,

Anyway with out further ado here is the link to the Google spreadsheet.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AishGsJCbguldG5vcV9sUkh4SXp5Y1FMQWlUYnhzcVE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AishGsJCbguldG5vcV9sUkh4SXp5Y1FMQWlUYnhzcVE)

I've created a lot of charts describing the data, if you're unfamiliar with Google spreadsheet there a list button in the bottom left corner that will quickly allow you access to all the other pages.

Since I couldn't make a nice verbal chart of the most popular combinations there I'll do it right here.


**Top 5 Race Class Combos**

* 41 - Castanic Slayer
* 34 - Castanic Warrior
* 29 - High Elf Priest
* 28 - Aman Lancer
* 26 - Elin Priest
* 26 - Castanic Sorcerer

**Edit**: Guess I should post the basic Class Race Numbers here too.

**Race Selections**

* 182 - Castanic
* 162 - Elin
* 139 - Human
* 122 - High Elf
* 87 - Aman
* 81 - Popori
* 50 - Baraka

**Class Selections**

* 121 - Lancer
* 117 - Priest
* 113 - Slayer
* 104 - Warrior
* 100 - Archer
* 93 - Mystic
* 88 - Sorcerer
* 87 - Berserker

**Edit 2**: So as I look over the data more I decided it be nice to see the role distribution, and it lines up very nicely with about 50% of warriors tanking; [take a peek](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AishGsJCbguldG5vcV9sUkh4SXp5Y1FMQWlUYnhzcVE#gid=27).

I've heard the horror stories of lancers kicking zerks or being assholes in general, but this is the first time I've seen it firsthand.

Story:

*I join a BT through instance matching.*

*Tank is from Feral Valley and is named 'Pimp'.*

*I ignore the douche alarm going off in my head. I didn't get insta-kicked this time for not having a +9 Dayslayer, so things are going better than normal.*

*We kill gorilla, move on to red kumas.*

*Pimp says, ""Ok, time to boot zerker or I go afk.""*

*Being just and upright defenders of the innocent, we politely tell the cockwasher to go fuck himself. Pimp watches while we kill the trash in front of kumas without his help.*

*As we're about to try 4-manning red kumas, zerker gracefully leaves without complaint.*

*Pimp emotes a fucking smiley.*

*He's party leader, nothing we can do.*

The End.

*******************************************

I already know there's not much we can do as a community to stop shit like this, other than appeal to En Masse for solutions.

**The game seems built to protect assholes.**

Scapes, Minea? You out there? Any ideas? Maybe vote-kick initiation for those who aren't party leader as well?

I am sad that this moment has come, but it has. I am no longer able to devote enough time to TERA to properly lead the Territ guild. Since Closed Beta 1 I have logged over *1200 hours* in the world of Arborea. That's unheard of for me, and an amazing accomplishment for Bluehole and EME. 

Now, however, I find that even though I *want* to keep playing TERA, I just don't have the time. With summer fast approaching, my time is more and more limited. I'm lucky to get on TERA long enough to do my dailies.

For that reason, I cannot continue leading Territ. You deserve someone who can devote more time and effort to it than I can. 

As of now, Territ will be run by /u/ajanata - He has been here just as long as I have, has logged even more time than me, and cares as much about the Guild as I do. He has been the co-leader for nearly a year now, and I know he will do a fine job taking the reigns.

Myself, I will still be playing TERA when I can. I have an Elite subscription after all, and I don't intend to waste it! I'll be staying in Territ at the lowly rank of whatever ajanata assigns me :) I will also continue my role as a subreddit moderator.

It has been a real honor and a pleasure to lead Territ for as long as I have. Thank you all!

Added additional hair colors to the following races:

* Humans: red, orange, yellow, green, blue
* Castanics: red, orange, yellow, green (Castanics are never blue.)
* Elins: red
* High Elves: red, orange, green, blue

Modified the alkahests used in item enchantment. Unique alkahests are used for specific tiers of enchantment.

* +1 to +6: Alkahest (sold by merchants)
* +7 to +9: Refined Alkahest (sold by specialty stores)
* +10 to +12: Masterwork Alkahest (sold by specialty stores)

Other stuff: 

* Removed the inter-server party-matching buff, the Valkyon’s Response reward, and the Rescue Supplies. Grouping is its own reward.
* Destiny Eggs and Lucky Eggs have been removed as quest rewards. The eggs were the primary source of combat consumables until the alchemy crafting system was complete. Any eggs earned in the Open Beta Test will still be there.
* Gula Skinners in the Hungry Caverns no longer spawn minions because that’s not how they roll.
* Items from Balder’s Temple and the Fane of Kaprima are now visible via smart search.
* Deleted the unnecessary “Subscription Information” menu from the main menu.

Bugs: 

* Fixed a bug where certain surfaces appeared to flash, glow, or appear dark. We don’t want any flashing in TERA.
* Fixed a bug where channels on the Island of Dawn increase infinitely.

Thanks for Subbing and making this community grow. two months ago we had a 1/4 of the number of redditors here and maybe 1/16 of the submissions. So we need to make sure every one knows our ground rules. These are outlined on the side bar but it seems not everyone reads them or understands them but no worries we would like to just clear the up a few things.
  
  
We have been enforcing from day one ""Submissions that enable or have the intent to enable piracy and online RMT(Real Money Trading) are not permitted."" this includes buying Ktera accounts and private servers. The fact of the matter is that Hangame requires a Korean Social Security Number which is Identity theft so we are removing any links or instructions how to gain access to this.
  
  
We have also been posting once a Beta Stream thread this is to cut down on ""check out my stream"" threads that would take over the Front page. So keep and eye open for that kind of stuff. ;)
  
  
The other Thing we need to mention is Self Promotion. This is a weird slippery slope we want to see what our members are doing we watch practically all of it. :) But we need people to post orginal content and news content. If you are posting only links to what you do for a tera website and never post anything else we dont like seeing that and feel we will need to take action. If you feel like you may be violating this feel free to ask the mods we will let you know.
  
  
Lastly, we will be removing any topic that is a Elin censorship thread. These topics are like beating a dead horse and if you wish to discuss this go to the official fourms and discuss it there.

Got a quest to kill the Fibralist (sp?) People were looking for more people to kill them. The armor upgrade was nice so i decided to tag along for the quick rewards. It was me (a 25 warrior) a 26 lancer and a 26 zerker. The lancer knew what he was doing... me and the zerker on the other hand had no idea what we were doing. ended up dieing twice each and having to run back while the Lancer tanked the BAM like a BAMF. After the first deaths the zerker said ""We need help"" to which i responded ""no we just need to be quicker."" It struck me... When had id ever said that about an elite mob quest in a traditional MMORPG? Usually if the mob is killing you and you are using all of the abilities you have at your disposal and you can't kill it you need to go searching for more people or just a healer. But in Tera you just need to be able to read mob better and react quicker. We killed the first one and went onto the second one, didn't die once. After the quest i soloed one. I dont have any new gear to show for it... but in a short period i could see major improvement in how i was playing.

At that point the novelty of an MMO with a genuinely fun combat system stopped outweighing the fact that there is actually nothing fun left to do in this game, and no enjoyable/meaningful way to continue progressing.

I can bang out my dailies for three weeks just to be rewarded again and again with randomized jewelry that has stats that my class can't even use. Sure glad I do those dailies.

I can get in a Fane of Kaprima hard mode after work, but doing only one FoK a day (any more is impossible due to the hours long lockout) means a couple of months just to get the one item. That makes that time spent each day feel pretty meaningless.

I lucked out and got the most important glyphs from ToT already, thankfully, because that repetition gets old fast. It's a neat concept and all, hinging the success of the party on the individual players' ability to solo BAMs, but the entire time spent killing trash while waiting for and after completing your BAM is just tedium.

I can waste six hours of my weekend trying to keep my PvP gear up to date in the completely unenjoyable lagfest that is VoT Nexus events. After a few weekends of trying to do Nexus, I just can't bring myself to do it anymore, and not being able to keep my PvP gear up to date pretty much kills my will to PvP.

There's absolutely no fun to be had in the Nexus, it is easily the worst gameplay experience I've seen in any modern MMO. I'm going to level with you: the Nexus, in my eyes, is actually stupider than the Vanilla WoW Gates of Ahn'Qiraj ""war effort"" event which required the server to farm and turn in *literally* 3237000 items to open the new raid content. At least that event indirectly encouraged huge amounts of world PvP by forcing thousands of players to go all over Azeroth to farm materials. It also created great community events like lotteries and rewards systems, paid for by the larger guilds in order to incentivize the non-raiding players to help unlock the new content.

It's even stupider than the other part of that event which pitted the major guilds of each server against eachother in a race to gather 16800 bug carapace in order to open up the quest line to complete the Scepter necessary to open the gates. That actually forced major guild confrontations and tensions, and again, massive amounts of world PvP.

The Nexus, which is the only way to obtain PvP gear, actually disables PvP. What?

As an afterthought, why are there still so many translation/localization errors/typos/ambiguities and inconsistencies? Mostly item modifier descriptions but also some glyph and crystal descriptions. With how often EME is patching, doesn't it seem like that would be one of the absolute simplest fixes that makes the game more polished?

So, I guess I'm just done with TERA for a while. I really do hope the game gets polished up, but for now it just really doesn't have anything to offer outside of its combat system.",,False,self,t5_2s527,1341115054.0,,b2,True,t3_vv625,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/vv625/im_not_sure_why_i_expected_more_from_tera/,

**EME seems to be ignoring these issues altogether. Hopefully we can change their minds, or at least get a simple reply here.**
[/EDIT]

EME seems to enjoy removing things for one reason or another.

I'm fine with the removal of Private Shops -- as a Broker/AH system is far superior. I do wish they'd remove fees to make up for it though, or allow people to still have shops but make their items appear on the Broker so we don't have to actually find them, allowing location-based vending while not making it annoying for general buyers.

But, some of the big things that I'm finding really annoying:

**The removal of Boxes of Mischief.**
I honestly can't understand EME's reasoning behind this one. The only reason I've seen is that some guy from EME ""personally had a negative winning streak with them"", and that it ""frustrated players more than it benefitted"". Both of these reasons, suck.

Perhaps the most useful thing you could do with these, was turn unwanted Crystals into, possibly, something useful. How many of you have been NPCing crystals that do more damage to minions and such, because nobody in the world would want them? Normally, in the original TERA, you'd throw them at your box of mischief and hope that you get something useful. So, because of that, we have things like Acrimonious/Carving Crystals costing upwards of 200-300 Gold. That's quite a bit for something many DPS players will have to replace every couple deaths. There are not white or Pristine versions of these and some other crystals, there's no cheaper way out. This also hurts crafting, not being able to duplicate materials by chance. I never tested personally, but I'm pretty sure you could do it with Runes, which would give an option to profit on Archrunes of Arun and such.

Not to mention, nobody is forcing anyone to use the boxes. Nobody in the right mind would throw something valuable into a box anyways. I don't see why they needed to be removed, whatsoever. I hope EME will bring them back one day.

**Removal of Eggs.** EME also removed Lucky/Destiny/Fortune eggs from quest rewards/drops. You still have them if you gained them dring OBT, but you can't anymore. Again, I don't see the point of removing these. If there was a particular reward that EME didn't want to see being gained from it, they could have altered the reward list... Another method of making money and obtaining random useful items gone.

**Removal off Craft Skill-Up Quests.** For every CBT, we had quests you could get from the guild board that would aid in skilling up your crafts. The removal of these quests are the reason crafting past 250 sucks so bad currently. It shouldn't be this way. Especially not with the drop rate penalty on farming the runes required to get past 250, when you're level 60. It's ridiculous.

I'm sure there's more I could talk about, but that's most of the big ones I can think of right now.

**So, why is EME removing content all of the time?** This game is still pretty fresh in general, and I don't understand whatsoever how removing all of this stuff helps. It's one thing when you remove something nobody would ever use, but it's another when you remove something because idiots will get frustrated with it.

So, yeah, big all of text, I know. Sorry if any of my information is incorrect, pretty sure it's all solid though. Does anyone else get annoyed with all of these things being gone? Would be sweet if EME took notice on this, though obviously very doubtful.",,False,self,t5_2s527,1337895929.0,,,True,t3_u2d2p,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/u2d2p/anyone_else_annoyed_with_eme_removing_things_from/,

EDIT: I guess I should add that I'm not unsubscribing because I do not enjoy the game.  As I stated in a reply below ""It's a money and time issue at the moment.  Doesn't mean I won't consider playing in the future.  I am enjoying the game thoroughly, I however, have a cross-country move coming up in early June and have to focus on some other priorities first.""

Then my Tera membership items took 3 weeks to arrive, mmm not so great. Cracks had already started appearing but I still went and got a boxed copy for founder status. Despite the extra 30 days of membership from my boxed copy they decided to bill my Tera Club membership again. Hey nevermind at least now all my new characters will get the village atlas... nope. 

OK so I'll raise a ticket... 4 weeks still no reply...OK. 

I'll cancel my sub I've got 40 days of membership left and this way I can use up my free time from the boxed copy before starting the membership going again...I log in today and they've deleted the village atlas from the 1 and only character who had it even though I've got 40 days of membership left. 

I guess I could always raise another support ticket....

So will you please pick up the damn balls/orbs/motes/round thingies and spare me the aggravation of a dead group? You see, a mystic relies on YOUR participation, which might be a new concept for many out there. All I ask is that you pick up the god damn red ball to keep yourself topped off.

Don't worry about your leveling pace. Thanks to some damage buffs from a previous patch, Lancers are much more potent than they were when the game first launched. 

Not only was their damage boosted pretty much across the board, they also got a few new spells. One of those new spells, called Wallop, is quite the heavy hitter. 

To demonstrate, I solo'd two low level BAMs and recorded the fights. You can find the links below:





level 28 Arachnen BAM - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyAWYlskQh8&amp;feature=youtu.be

level 32 Crab BAM - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIobepGaiZk&amp;feature=youtu.be





You'll see in these videos that, not only is it easy to solo BAMs as a Lancer, but it can also be very quick! 

Lancers also received a Backstep ability, and this allows us to pass through BAMs to reach their backs more frequently, and take advantage of those ""critical damage from behind"" crystals that you can stack on your weapons. 

So if you were thinking of rolling a Lancer, but you were worried about a slow leveling pace (or the need for several party mates in order to efficiently complete your BAM quests), worry no more! Go. Be a tank. Be awesome. ",,False,self,t5_2s527,False,,,True,t3_17vkda,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/17vkda/new_f2p_players_dont_underestimate_the_power_of/,

Just a few words from us Mods. Thanks for Subbing and making this community grow, we have been growing exponentially after these recent betas. Open beta made the game grow along with this community so we need to make sure everyone knows our ground rules. These are outlined on the side bar, but it seems that not everyone reads them or understands them. No worries, we would like to just clear up a few things. 
  
It has been brought to our attention that many subscribers are not aware of what ""[Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) is and what it entails; Reddiquette is an informal expression of reddit's community values as written by the community itself. Please abide by it the best you can!"" We encourage you to read this if you are new to reddit and would like to better yourself as a citizen of this great hive mind. We would like to draw your attention to a few point’s in particular.
  
&gt; Please utilize Reddit's upvote and downvote system. The up and down arrows are your tools to make reddit what you want it to be. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to reddit or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it. Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something, but only if you really think it will help the original poster improve their point. The down arrow is for comments that add little or nothing to the discussion. Downvoting personal opinions just because you disagree with them is not proper Reddiquette.
  
We have been enforcing the following from day one: ""Submissions that enable or have the intent to enable piracy and online RMT(Real Money Trading) are not permitted."" This includes buying Ktera accounts and private servers. The fact of the matter is that Hangame requires a Korean Social Security Number which is Identity theft so we are removing any links or instructions on how to gain access to this. It should also go without saying that we are not going to allow any posts that are selling or trading of accounts. 
  
We also need to mention self promotion, we ask that people people post orginal content and news content. If you are only posting links to what you do for a TERA website and never post anything else we don't like consider that solid contribution and we will need to take action. If you wish to run this through one of us before you post a link feel free to let us know and we'll let you know if it is appropriate.
  
Memes, Guilds, and Pics, some of you have stated that you would like us to start subreddits for each of these things. We don’t see memes being appropriate or attributing to conversation. Guild recruitment and image posts do not seem to be getting in the way of conversations however, if they get out of hand we may take action. You are free to create your own subreddit for your own guild.
  
Lastly, we want to bring up the topic of game client mods such as replacing Elin armor or voice packs. We are aware that it is easy to do and can be done without much effort, however we would not encourage anyone to do so and post it on /r/TeraOnline. It is against the TOS from EME and Frogster so we needed to draw the line somewhere. So if you post a link with your Elin archer wearing KTera armor and not cargo pants and you don’t hide your name we are not going to ban you, BUT EME vists our subreddit frequently and it is a in game bannable offence. We don't want to see anyone get banned for this so please keep this in mind.
  
Other than that, we all hope everyone has a great time playing TERA and contributing to this community!

basically we got to kaprima and brought boss down to 35%, then all of the sudden the mystic just stopped healing me and my friend saying how he was lagging, and at first i had no idea and i did what i had to do. Kept dpsing then boss did 3 rotations of backswing and got me, and my friend too since we didnt get a single heal

Then they decided to kill the boss and take the loot themselves

here are the screenshots

their names are
Crapfalcon
Denzel
Lurikeen

all 3 were from basilisk crag

i believe players like them should be punished for ruining other players the gaming environment

The first area you get to is very beautiful already, the Island of Dawn. Then you get the area around Lumbertown, which has its own mountaineous charme. Val Aureum simply looks amazing and I've never seen anything like it in any other video game.
Then the labyrinths and open world ""dungeons""... amazing. 
And don't even get me started by how impactful battles feel. If you fight a huge boss, you are scared shitless of that thing (unless you have overgeared people in your group)... like the last bosses in Cultist's Refuge I just fought.

I'm definitely glad I bought EMP last weekend cause it feels like such a steal otherwise. All of this amazing stuff for free? Really?

Thanks for providing me with great entertainment value for as much money as I want to spend on it. And thanks for making one of the best f2p business models in the industry.

We are a reddit guild centered around this subreddit (r/TeraOnline). Our core tends to be more hardcore when it comes to content, but we accept any and all fellow redditors!


How to contact us:

* Website: http://territ.us/
* IRC: **irc.territ.us:6667**, Channel: **#territ**
* Teamspeak 3: **ts3.territ.us**, Port: **9989**, Password: **territ1986**

You can also reach any of us in-game either through our chat channel (**Territ**, password **1986**), applying through the TERA interface, or by whispering one of the following in-game:

Sylley, Darkmod, Elbrar, Maroot, Sekhmet, Critical, Netskie, Mieka

We also have created a subreddit for our guild over at http://www.reddit.com/r/Territ/ feel free to discuss anything Territ related there so we don't overrun this subreddit with guild related posts. 

We also plan to carry this guild over into retail and we are currently waiting on the official server list to determine what server we will be on come Open Beta/Headstart/Retail. So if you'd like to play with redditors then you can still contact any of us as we will be there for those as well.


**NOTE:** As we are typically associated with reddit, we tend to be a large target for GvG.

Galaxies .: the game always comes with a free month when bought and not just pre ordered too correct? And since i have to sign up for a monthly payment plan for game time will i be able to cancel it right after i get the game and still use the time i have?

GM Temujin: One moment please, I'm going to confirm those answers real quick before I tell you.

Galaxies .: ok

GM Temujin: Ok, I have confirmed that the 30 free days IS a pre-order special, and yes you should be able to cancel your subscription after placing it, and use the rest of the time till the next bill date.

**Here is the update.**

GM The.Mad.Doctor: Hi, my name is GM The.Mad.Doctor. How may I help you?

itswhysee .: Hi there. I'm contacting you guys because I had a question.

GM The.Mad.Doctor: ok

itswhysee .: So I was looking through Reddit (not sure if you know what that is) but I came across an interesting post about a question someone asked another GM rep.

itswhysee . **I COPIED AND PASTED THE CONVO.**

GM The.Mad.Doctor: hmm let me look

itswhysee .: That's the conversation. It seemed strange to me that you don't get a 1 free month for purchasing the game without pre-order, since most P2P MMO's do have this feature.

GM The.Mad.Doctor: Ok bought or preordered comes with a free month...we had an email about this lol

itswhysee .: Oh so it was just a miscommunication?

GM The.Mad.Doctor: Yes

itswhysee .: Okay, I'm glad that's cleared up!

GM The.Mad.Doctor: We love being posted on Reddit....if it's good lol...

itswhysee .: Haha yeah the userbase on /r/teraonline is definitely getting bigger.

GM The.Mad.Doctor: I know : )

itswhysee .: Gonna post this conversation as a response to clear it up. Any jokes for Territ? :)

GM The.Mad.Doctor: Sure

GM The.Mad.Doctor: hmmm

GM The.Mad.Doctor: Nah I'm comin with a blank....that are clean lol

GM The.Mad.Doctor: I will however say this

GM The.Mad.Doctor: Everyone on Reddit I hope you enjoy Tera as I will also....Please don't kill the Mad 
Docter.....I want to live

GM The.Mad.Doctor: Not that that's my name......you'll never find me

itswhysee .: Haha alright, thanks again for your time and being awesome.

I could set up a mumble and IRC server in my spare VPS, so that wouldn't be a problem. I don't really have time to set up and administer a web site though.

This is my personal favorite list so feel free to add some exceptional kills if you have some. By exceptional I mean 3man or less with no double DPS setup (sorry but dobuble DPS with healer in MC HM is just like 4man kill, not impressive as much because tank is not really required for Shandra). Exceptional kills are also those speed runs or with nice rotations.

EDIT: Grammar ;&lt;

This is just absurd,33,2,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/1cobw7/getting_rid_of_people_that_bot_battlegrounds/,"Been off Tera for a while to come back quite recently to do some more battlegrounds. I've encountered them before, the so called 'leechers' or 'botters'. They are becoming more and more common apparently and i would hate to give up playing because some of my game experience gets ruined by people being AFK in the base.

Got one on your team? Too bad. But you might think to yourself, initiate a votekick? Get rid of that afker! Yeah!

Well no.. I've seen people try, i have tried myself, but sadly, **in order to kick someone you need to be 120 seconds out of combat** (while there is no way of telling how long you have waited, you have to repeatedly try until it works). Indirectly this requires you to leech at least 2 minutes yourself.

After the first step is complete and you finally get to initiate a vote kick you also have to convince and have at least 14/15 in your raid to accept the vote kick within 30 seconds, **if one declines it won't work.** (Fairly sure this is exactly how it is, never succeeded  a vote kick so correct me if I'm wrong here) Also, **if someone is dead during a vote kick he/she can't vote.**

Now here is the hardest part, when/if you manage to initiate a vote kick you can't do anything UI related whatsoever. Meaning, **if you want to open the chat and tell everyone to accept or something similar, you'll press enter and this will actually cancel the vote kick**, fun times!

I know some, maybe even most of you have never encountered bots being afk the entire game in the base to get free points, but i sure have. Unless something is really done about it things will eventually just get out of hand and i don't know what to do about it, but i figured this post is a place to start to get people a bit aware of the situation.


This is strictly speaking from my experience i have with battlegrounds on EU servers. I don't know if people experience this in other regions or not

1358278281.0,31,self.TeraOnline,16mukb,"Territ is full: What this means for current and prospective members, and what you can do about it. Also general information about the guild.",44,13,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/16mukb/territ_is_full_what_this_means_for_current_and/,"TERA has a 300 member limit on guilds. Territ reached this rather quickly in the last week (though still slower than in Open Beta). This means we cannot currently accept more characters into the guild.

edit: And we can't kick any inactive characters right now, either, simply because every character is active. The guild had about 15 characters in it this time last week. They're all either still active or have already been kicked.

During Open Beta, we had an overflow guild (Subterrit). This was extremely difficult to manage. The current management of Territ is not going to do this again, though of course we can't stop other people from making their own guild and inviting the community to join it as well.

**If you are currently in Territ**, we ask that you only keep 2 active characters in the guild. This is rather hard to enforce as the game intentionally makes it impossible to determine if two characters belong to the same account. Please, be kind to your fellow redditors and make room for them by removing excess and inactive alts. Even if you are actively playing an alt, it would be nice if you would consider removing it from the guild to make room for somebody else's main character.

**If you are not yet in Territ**, you may still apply to the guild. ~~We will be going through the applications list and accepting people in application order as spaces free up. Main characters will be accepted over alt characters if application messages specify such.~~ [Since the Applications list is fundamentally broken](http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/16nlln/this_is_a_serious_bug_that_needs_fixed_immediately/), we will be accepting applications from the 12th ~~oldest~~ newest backwards (getting older) until there are fewer than 12 applications in the queue. Sorry if you've been in the queue for a long time, but there isn't anything we can do about it. =\

**Any interested party** may join a chat channel we're going to try to use to help people that are stuck out of the guild -- type `/chat territ 1986` to join it (if it says ""Channel does not exist"" do `/make territ 1986` but obviously nobody else is in the channel yet). To chat there, use `/1`. I have no idea if chat channels work for trial players. Unfortunately, you must manually join the channel every time you connect.

We *may* be kicking characters that are still on the Island of Dawn that have not played for several days during this free period -- this is yet to be determined.

After the first week of free to play, we will return to our previous method of kicking characters that have been inactive for 2-3 weeks. We will not kick for inactivity during the time frame between this free week and free to play as that would be unfair to people who either did not renew their subscription or were on the trial but will want to continue playing. We measure inactivity by looking at the ""Last online"" column in the guild list -- simply logging in to the game on your character will reset your inactivity timer.

**General information**

Copying from [vsTerminus's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/16bbl1/new_and_returning_players_want_to_play_with_other/):

&gt; With the recent F2P announcement, there are a lot of new and returning faces. Many of you will be looking for people to play with, and that's where Territ comes in.

&gt; We can help you find party members to run dungeons, complete quests, or compete in battlegrounds. We can also give you some friendly people to chat with while you play.

&gt; To join Territ, you must be on the **PvP** server (""Mount Tyrannas""). While in-game, press Esc to switch to UI mode and go to [Social Menu -&gt; Guilds On Server](http://i.imgur.com/MTlRq.png). In the Guild Name box, type in 'Territ' and click Search. Finally, click on 'Apply to Guild' and either myself or a moderator will accept you :)

&gt; We'll take anyone at any level, whether you're brand new or you've been playing since beta.
Territ's only rule is, and has always been, ""Don't be a dick!"" If you think you can handle that, we'd love to have you!

Several of us have been around since Closed Beta 1. We know this game inside and out and will help newcomers with pretty much anything they ask.

We have [a website](http://territ.us), though it hasn't been updated much recently as the guild was pretty dead for the last several months. We have a [TeamSpeak 3 server](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads) at ts3.territ.us:9989 that any current or prospective member is welcome to use. There is currently no password on the server and this will remain the case as long as the server isn't abused. We also have [an IRC (text chat) channel](http://territ.us/chat/) that several of us hang out in when we're not playing the game.

**Guild Bank:** If you see something you would like in the guild bank, just ask in /g and a moderator will almost certainly fetch it for you.

You are playing an MMORPG, multi-player ... roleplaying game.

Think of any MMORPG more  like an electronic game of old school DnD -- it is NOT a race. This is not meant to be a 1 player cRPG ie put in 45 hours and Finish the Game.  This is supposed to be an R.P.G.  There is no Winning, no Finishing, no END.  Its an RPG

I want tons of content, TONS... but I don't want all the content to get added just for the 'capped' players.  This is meant to be a gaming experience, your character... your Hero is growing and there will hopefully be some wonderful electronic stories told and retold about just what you've accomplished... BUT the tale told fondly of saving a village over-run by hordes thanks to careful negotiation (quest storylines) along w/some canny opponents taken out in epic style could and Should happen at any level span.

The whole rant ""no end game content"" just makes me livid.  This is a new game. Play it for the experiences at every one of your levels between 1 and cap, and most important of all...

Life is an adventure they always say, and TERA is a digital life. Enjoy the journey and leave the destination to itself.  Beyond that...

LOBBY for new content across the board not just end game stuff.

1338407537.0,29,self.TeraOnline,ucl2y,Let's talk about Temple of Temerity,31,2,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/ucl2y/lets_talk_about_temple_of_temerity/,"Did a quick run of Temple of Temerity today during lunch and learned quite a bit right off the bat. I guess this could be a PSA, but I want to get into the nitty gritty here too if possible, including drop rates with success etc.  

**Quick run-down/PSA:**

* The dungeon is only 20 minutes long, with three optional bosses and and normal dungeon lockout (halved if you use Instance Matching)

* The dungeon consists of wave after wave of *normal* monsters, so rock those Hunter crystals. Later on in the waves, explosive barrels can be used to clear mobs, and traps become available to trigger.

* There is an NPC in the dungeon who will give you a potion. Hold on to it!

* There are 3 rooms. The main room with the crystal you must protect from the monsters and two side rooms where they spawn. The optional bosses will also spawn as time progresses in these rooms. 

* If you enter either side room you will become silenced - this is what the potion is for. *It doesn't last long (2 minutes)* and has a 20 minute cooldown, so don't squander it - use it only as you're entering to solo a boss.

* You will get scaling rewards the more monsters the party kills and the more optional bosses are cleared.  

**Actual Run-Down/Quick Guide:**

* Talk to the NPC to get your potions. 

* Activate the relic to start the timer. Make sure the team is ready first.

* Protect the crystal in the middle from the waves of trash.

* After a few minutes, the first boss will spawn. It is a kumas. One DPS can chug a potion and solo it. Anyone who hasn't quaffed a potion will be silenced upon entering.

* Continue killing the trash. Soon barrels will spawn for you to destroy trash with. They do not injure you or your team. 

* Soon after, the second boss spawns. This boss is an snail. You may want to send your tank + dps for this one.

* The trash continues. The third boss is an arachnen (SM Boss). Use your final DPS to take him down.

* In the last leg of the dungeon, 3 traps will be spawned. One in front of each door which are on short CDs - these are spike traps that slow and do AOE damage - and one in the middle. The middle trap - the Cataclysmic something or other trap - is an OH $#!% trap that clears the whole room. Save that for when the 'Game of Death' wave comes. At that point (2 mins IIRC) enemies will swarm from both sides and be rather overwhelming.

* ???

* Profit  

So that's it folks. It's actually pretty easy, and the only reason we didn't kill all the bosses is that I was noob and needed me some o' that fancy potion when the dungeon started.  

**What do we get?**

Rewards from this dungeon are Dire and Practicum badges, as well as (AFAIK) gold necklaces and possibly other jewlery and crystals. 

* A new badge merchant has appeared in the center of Kaiator that will trade 60 Dire badges for one advanced glyph. 

* Another merchant will trade 15 practicum badges for one glyph box that has a chance of producing an advanced glyph.  

It should be noted that my run only killed 2 of the bosses and 250 trash mobs. We recieved 3 Practicum Badges and 1 Dire Badge. This is where you guys come in. Let's start aggregating! Let's find out what other yellows drop (we got a necklace much better than Blooddrop with +3% AS) and what the badge rates are. Also, discuss the dungeon and give feedback, criticism etc. GO!  

EDIT: Drops include

* Crystal guard scrolls

* Dire Badge(s)

* Practicum Badges

* Uncommon Cruxes

* Gold jewellery

&gt;I have good news and bad news. We will start with the bad news. (For TLDR skip to bottom. Useless information inc)

&gt;Unfortunately there was a Snorlax who was sitting in the way of me getting to our account management admin panel to attempt to change your name. It was crazy, I had to go to Vemilion city and talk to an old man. He told me that the only way to wake a snorlax is with a pokeflute, and the only way I can obtain a pokeflute is if I make peace with Cubones mother. 

&gt;So the good news is that I made peace with Cubones mother and the old man, who had a machop, supplied me with the pokeflute. Once I played the tune required to wake the sleeping giant I was granted access to our control panel. 

&gt;From there I had to challenge Brock (don't ask me why he was here and not in pewter city) to a battle. My only pokemon, Pikachu, is extremely weak against rock types, so I figured I would never defeat him and be able to change your public name! Suddenly, a fire breaks out and onyx is weakened by the water! I'm conflicted... I would win on a technicality and harm brocks honor if I defeat him because of a fire, but at the same time... you, a paying customer, deserves your public name changed! 

&gt;But no, I'm an honorable trainer. Just as I turn to leave Brock grants me access to our admin panel. From there I successfully changed your username to Radant.

&gt;Congratulations!



&gt;TLDR/ What in the hell is all of this : I changed your username to Radant as you requested.

&gt;If you have any further questions or concerns please do not hesitate to message us again!


I got this as a response to a request for a forum name changed and it made me laugh! The ticket was open for 30 minutes max. I thought some of you might enjoy the story and others of you would be glad to hear that EME/BHS has awesome customer support.

http://patch.tera.enmasse-game.com/temp/Game_-1to11.zip

* Install the TERA-Launcher by going to account.enmasse.com signing in, and clicking ""Download Game""
* Double click the Setup.exe file that was downloaded
* Go through the installation process of the launcher. Do not double click the launcher after the installation finishes
* If you played TERA during CBT5 and need to update to the most recent patch download the patch from http://patch.tera.enmasse-game.com/temp/Game_10to11.zip. If you have not downloaded TERA before, or it is currently not installed go to http://patch.tera.enmasse-game.com/temp/Game_-1to11.zip and download the file. This will take a little while as the file is over 20GB
* When the download finishes, unzip the files into your TERA folder. (Default location is C:\Program Files (x86)\TERA for 64 bit version of Windows and C:\Program Files\TERA for 32 bit versions of Windows)
* Start the TERA-Launcher

Above are directions for how to install the game directly from EnMasse's website. You would just skip the Launcher portion until after you've purchased the game from Amazon.

* Gold items come with 3 random effects. The effects that can be changed by using scrolls have 2 small green arrows that form a circle at the end of it. (5g per scroll to re-identify it)

For example, back in WoW I played tank and DPS, never healer, and generally chose tiny characters or extremely large ones (gnomes, draenei, goblins, tauren). The Popori were what grabbed my attention initially (badgerrrrr), and the Baraka appeal to me as well, but the Aman females--whoa! I love their look. Not so common for me--a mid-sized toon. 

For the OBT, I started a Popori slayer and he is definitely right up my alley so far. The Baraka appeal to me as well, but the Aman females--whoa! I love their look. Not so common for me--a mid-sized toon.

Based on meager experience with a lancer, I was disappointed with how it felt and may not take that route (though will persist a ways, in case I like it later on) but maybe warrior will be more instantly engaging.

I'll start with what I think is cool to know (on top of my mind).

* Always try to party up with people doing same quest as you... As soon as you are 2 or more, you get 0 cooldown on quest monster since you kill them too fast.

* Fastest way to level 1-32 I found is:

* &gt; 1-20 Quests 

* &gt; 20-25 SB runs &amp; Bailisk

* &gt; 25-27 Quests

* &gt; 27-32 SM runs + Ovolith

* The LFG tool (""Y"") is very usefull when you want to do stuff that you cannot queue for. I found about this tool sunday and I wish everyone would know about it! You can type ""/lfg blablabla[30 letter max]"" to open a LFG. People can apply to your LFG; it'll send you a message with &lt;Name&gt;&lt;Class &amp; lvl&gt;; &lt;accept&gt;or&lt;Deny&gt;. I suggest you look in the LFG tool before creating one...

* When the tank is kitting monster to make a huge stack, PLEASE DO NOT DO ANYTHING, EVEN HOLD YOUR BREATH. Nothing is worst than a mystic dropping an HP ball and breaking aggro when tank is kiting 10 monster then shit turns to hell 1 time out of 2 (Healer gets aggro, DPS turns on that monster, the huge stack doesnt get killed &amp; tank dies).

* People liked the way I tanked once dungeons gets easier: I would grab 5-12 monsters(This is when you shouldn't break the aggro or it get messy), walk back behind a wall/cornor (out of sight) and wait till the monster pilled up, then taunt &gt; GAME ON &gt; AOE and DPS all the monster in a single target bunch - most of the time.

* You can party invite people by typing ""/invite Player.Name""

* You can claim you pre-order items and w.e by going in the menus &gt; Item Claim (or something close to that).

* Don't put loot option on Roll exeption for ""uncommon"", that spams the roll prompt for shit items.",,False,self,t5_2s527,True,,archer,True,t3_sro9w,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/sro9w/lets_make_a_tera_protipfyi_thread/,

Well let me start by saying that I've personaly read lots of posts just like this one in the past but I've always told myself the grass cant be THAT greener on the other side, its probably just angry nerds trying to vent out.


NOPE


After the resent epic and total fail by Gameforge with the August events I installed NA just to try it out this weekend. Right now I reached Lumbermill @ lvl 11. So what went down so far?

I went to the site I started to DL the client is nothing absolutely nothing like the EU client. Not only it looks 100 times more professional it also allows you to start playing the game withing 10-15 min while dling the rest of the game in the background. Big woop?

So I start making a character and I notice that in the name tab you can type virtually anything you like, no restrictions. Bloody.Fury.Shadow your thing? You got it.

I log in with a less subtle name and a msg pops up that I got items to claim from lvl 1. Its a regular starter mount, a 7 day pet to pick up my trash and a 50% boost. Wow..

Then I see ppl selling race/name change vouchers in global for about 8k gold (a mes is worth 250g). REALLY? There arent even **** like that in EU. You gotta pay 20 euro for something like that only your account can use obviously.

So I immediately open the shop and then my eyes go like O.O The shop is freaking HUGE. All sorts of stuff I've never ever seen before. Thousands of stuff.

I decide to check out a few small things before I start playing. There are couple of bugs on EU like unable to unfriend/unblock someone in your friendlist with the button and you gotta type /ublock &lt;name&gt; in chat instead. GES WAT GUSY? Its all working perfectly fine in NA.

Personaly I got a graphix issue. My driver crashes every few hours when I play the game. Dunno why, I've tried all sorts of stuff reinstalling, clocking, underclocking, older drivers. It still crashes. Yes only in TERA. I've been playing in NA for 2 hours now. Everything is fine. I'd gotten at least 1 crash till now 100%.

Then I started playing and the 2nd tree drops me an orange lockbox for that popo pet thats currently being sold as a random lootbox in EU shop. R O F L

I'd also like to mention (this is on MT server) that so far I havent seen any retarded players spamming their asses in global channels. (Yes I mean you gank and co. retards, ppl on Killian know) Could it be that players fear/respect ""game authorities"" here?

So if you are a passionate player who enjoys TERA as much as I do and you are playing on EU rush to http://tera.enmasse.com/ and start downloading. No reason in the world to spend another second on EU even if you got a VM piece as far as I care. I'm so sorry I've ever spend cash for club/items on Gameforge. You don't deserve a penny. You are running what could be a perfect mmo in the ground for Europe.

Wanted to do a google docs, but the raw data is too much, so I'll just update this if I come up with more numbers. Gonna do server counts.

Level 20+:

Archer -  3856 -  13%       
Berzerker  - 3613  - 13%       
Lancer -  3321 -  12%       
Warrior - 4067 -  14%       
Slayer -  4203  - 15%       
Sorcerer -  3354 -  12%       
Mystic  - 2834 -  11%       
Priest -  3406  - 12%

Level 11+:

Archer    -  10064  - 14%       
Berzerker -  8576 -   12%      
Lancer    -  7265  -  10%       
Warrior   -  11047  - 16%      
Slayer   -   10013 -  14%       
Sorcerer -  8717 -   12%       
Mystic   -   6935 -   11%       
Priest    -  7671   -  11%

Raw:

Archer    -  35276      
Berzerker -  28880       
Lancer   -   25073       
Warrior   -  40352

this is especially useful if you have a SSD or fast cpu/mobo

We have a **[website](http://territ.us)** with a **[roster](http://territ.us/roster/)**, a **[chat room](http://territ.us/chat/)**, and more. 

We also have a **Teamspeak 3** server that is open to all members, and we encourage you all to use it. Info is available on the site or in the chat.

If you're looking for a party to run with right from the start, now is the time to get into the [chat room](http://territ.us/chat/). Once the servers open, Teamspeak will get pretty busy. You can always join us there and find a party that has an open spot, or start your own and invite others to it.

Keep in mind, this is a *casual guild* that exists for the purpose of bringing people together. Most people don't want to solo an MMO and we want to help with that. 

- Acceptance into the guild requires only that you ~~submit your character to our [roster](http://territ.us/roster)~~ apply to the guild in-game, and include either your reddit username or the guild member who referred you :) Please take a look at our **[Guild Charter](http://territ.us/p/guild_charter/)** for more information!

- For the hardcore players, we do have plans to open a sister guild for the more 'dedicated' people once retail begins. More on that in our [Guild Charter](http://territ.us/p/guild_charter/).

If you have your own IRC client you can connect to our chat that way too.

First, I must say that I am very impressed with this game.  I've been watching for the US release for over a year and was very excited by what I saw.  I was also skeptical that it wouldn't live up to expectations (I'm looking at you SWTOR).  After playing through this weekend, I can say that I look forward to the game's release and will be taking the time off work to get my leg up on the competition.

The leveling in this game did not feel too bad.  Some people mentioned that there is still quests of kill x or gather y.  I don't think you'll ever really be able to get away from that.  You are either going to be grinding mobs or grinding quests.  Trying to make a ton of quests that are dynamic and interesting would take thousands of man hours that only a company with tons of assets would be able to take advantage of.  But with a group, the quests fly by, and you can level amazingly quick.  You can solo, but it is much slower, so I am glad that grouping up to do stuff actually has merit when questing.  

The instances so far were a lot of fun.  I remember the first time I ran SB and 4/5 of our group members got killed when the rock guy slammed his arm down into the ground.  There haven't been any crazy amazing bosses yet, but just having some skills that bosses would use in other games applied with this combat system makes it somewhat refreshing.  And the graphics of some of the manor bosses were really cool.

PVP on the PVP server was actually pretty awesome as well.  I got pked a few times, but I also got to kill some pkers.  Once I hit 27 and got some decent gear, I joined my guild in GvG combat.  The encounters with one another were very dynamic, and just because one group outnumbered the other, it didn't mean victory.  Our smaller group of 8 people managed to beat out a group of 13.  

I'd say the most amazing part of the beta was when we were camping the gate to the entrance of manor for enemy guilds and about 100 No Fun Allowed guild members poured through the gate, wiping us all as they went along.  Just seeing such a large cavalry charge in itself was awesome.  But seeing that many people flow through the gates for over seconds and not seeing a single person warp or glitch or anything just floored me.  The net code in this game is amazing (IMO).

However, if you enable [this](http://i.imgur.com/6MkaM.jpg?1), you can use your movement keys to move, while menus remain open and without exiting UI mode!
The only downside to this is that you can't turn your character without pressing alt, turning, then going back into UI mode. However, if you're facing the direction you want to go, and run into a tree, you don't have to exit out of all your menus.

Edit for clarity:  This changes absolutely nothing for non-UI mode (battle mode). Every ability/dodge/attack will behave normally.
What this does is that in UI mode, you can use WASD to move your character, but you cannot rotate the camera (because your mouse has to move the cursor). So if you run into a tree while in UI mode, you can press A or D to move around it, then your autorun button, without exiting out of UI mode (and closing all your windows). If you run into a wall, or another large obstacle, while in UI mode, you have to press alt to go into battle mode, turn your camera, then press alt to go back into UI mode.",,False,self,t5_2s527,1337801819.0,,warrior,True,t3_u1d2w,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/u1d2w/protip_menus_while_moving/,

I can't tell if this game looks like something I'd enjoy or not. I say that because I was a SWTOR believer for too long...now I am a bit jaded on MMOs and part of me doesn't want to play them anymore.

Anyways couple things I would like to know if you don't mind:

1 Does this game have a coherent main story and character story? And by coherent, I mean non Japanese-esq surrealism. (Anyone else think FF has gone WAY over the deep end?)

2 What is this ""true combat"" system? Looks impressive, but I can't quite figure it out.

1328819656.0,27,self.TeraOnline,pi9jg,Anyone interested in a Reddit Guild/Alliance?,29,2,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/pi9jg/anyone_interested_in_a_reddit_guildalliance/,"Just as the title says, is there anyone that would be interested in having an official Reddit guild? I would love to have a guild full of knowledgeable players to play and learn with. Some group of people that would have my back when I had a question or needed help with some part of the game. Who better than the fine folks here on Reddit?

Now, I understand that there are many people who would love to create their own guild and would turn down a single guild of Reddit, but hear me out. How would you feel about being part of a Reddit alliance at the least? I'm not in the know when it comes to if there is an official alliance system or not, but even if it was an unofficial alliance I feel all the guilds involved would benefit.

I was really hoping to create a guild whose core members would be Redditors that I would recruit here, but I would feel a fool if I was to claim it was the official guild of Reddit. As much as I would love for my guild to claim that title, I don't believe that it would work out too well.

I don't really know, just tossing around ideas here really. Hoping to get a general feel how for or opposed the community is towards this topic.

And if anyone was interersted, I'll be starting up on NA Tera.

I play on Fraya (EU).

1. 3 weeks ago high latency problem started. It's not just me, almost everybody have lags. I won't even mention wiping for 4 hours on MCHM just because of that. Problem is still there right now. No clue if Failforge even knows about that.

2. Week ago bunch of people on TERA EU have been banned for no reason at all. 2 members of my static team were banned for nothing. They got unbanned after 2 days. Obviously we haven't heard a word about that from Gameforge. Why would we?

3. Yesterday Gameforge decided to ban them once again. Today they added our healer to them. One of them finaly got an answer from the 'support team'. No ban reason included. Just pure bullshit. Now all I have is our tank. I ain't gonna look for another static team just because Failforge owns TERA EU, lol. I submitted a ticket regarding those bans and I'm going to be really surprised if they give me an actual answer to my question in next month.

Support is not helpful at all and Failforge just bans people for no particular reason. No clue what to do. Anyone got banned like that as well? Or maybe knows somebody who is..

1340821597.0,23,self.TeraOnline,vp3wi,Played the 7 day trial.

So I wanted to try Tera after seeing all the awesome looking videos. A little history I have played several years of playing quite a few MMo's World of Warcraft, Everquest I+II, Guild wars, Star Trek Online, Perfect World, and lastly Ragnarok. So with all of these I felt something was missing mainly the player interaction I have memories of rolling over 1-5 then watching my paladin kill everything it just wan't fun. So setting out on my Journey I made a Slayer in the image of a close friend. 

Slayer
[Sashsa.Blade](http://i.imgur.com/qfg30.jpg)

I was joined by a IRL friend who was a priest both of us new and knew nothing. We finished the Island of Dawn without much difficulty although getting lost on the Ferocious flower felons, somehow we got to the gorge in our absentmindedness but we finished it. soon after we were thrust into the Magical world of Tera. We were in Awe of how beautiful it looked. Soon mounted we journeyed to the plains and began to clear the various areas. Soon we found ourselves at BoL however it being 3am no one was playing on a Tuesday. So I later finished the dungeon myself with a PUG, it was amazing I was blown away and soon was informed as I was killing the final boss that I had 5 minute left before it locked me out. I killed the boss took my picture and left it for later. 

Warrior
[Cuddle.This](http://i.imgur.com/mWiuZ.jpg)

I decided that I must experience the various classes and races. So I set out to play all the classes and every Race that I could. warrior and Elin was an interesting choice. My thought was small hitbox and quick movements make for a good evasive class. It was hard for me, I think this was the hardest one to get off the island alone that I did. I also had a lot of downtime. It seemed like it was me killing a few mobs then sitting by the camp fire. It look a long time but felt satisfying when I killed Karascha. Overall maybe it will get easier I may pick this class up again. 

Priest
[Sasha.Beauty](http://i.imgur.com/LvAmb.jpg)

I enjoyed myself quite a bit. I enjoyed having to worry about my friends and their health as much as myself. Also the large amount of downtime made me happy. I know that it will slow down drastically as it seems to with all MMO healing classes but for now I enjoyed myself. The final boss was a breeze and I even played longer into this class than the others off the island.  I will be coming back to this character. 

Archer
[Felixis](http://i.imgur.com/KKaa4.jpg)

Sadly this was the fastest I cleared the island however it felt boring and uninviting. Also felt like it took the Real Time action and slowed it down. As soon as I made it to Lumbertown I dropped this toon. Did not feel that connection. But for a lack of talking here is a chicken. 

Sorcerer
[Sasha.Firecracker](http://i.imgur.com/22tzK.jpg)

This was an interesting class, although it was very I have to kill you before you get to me otherwise I die. But all the same it was fun. Boss went down without trouble and only thing that even remotely slowed me was killing the Dark Reavers. It needed a better crowd control but I imagine that will come with time. 

Mystic
[Odepius](http://i.imgur.com/EAXph.jpg)

This was fun and I enjoyed it very much. Having a little tank Guy to get attention while I beat on things was fun. I wish the other classes had this. Made short work of everything but I am afraid that it did too many things and not enough of one thing for it to keep my interest. Wish the early self heal was a real heal and not the globe things. 

Lancer
[DragonBorn.Darknight](http://i.imgur.com/IMfG4.jpg)

Lancer was cool. I liked that I could block everything and take little damage and by the time I got to playing Lancer the Enemies were second nature and I could predict everything. I think I took less than 2k Damage the entire Island. I want this to be my class as I like having  the huge ego and it seems that they are the only class that everyone needs for the group and there are very little of. 

Beserker 
[Myamoto.Musashi](http://i.imgur.com/LAewj.jpg)

Very much felt to me as the same as the lancer just with some added DPS content. I liked it but didn't make a difference from the slayer and not enough quick fire damage to become a better lancer. finished out the Trial with this last night. Very good ending on a great 7 day trial. 


I Loved what I did and I have the full collectors edition Physical copy that I opened last night. I am now playing Sasha.Blade and you can find me on JC. I look forward to applying to Territ and will be active most days. 

Thank you for your time, 
Sahsa.Blade Slayer of Bears

I don't think DPS folks realize what they can contribute to a group other than just damage, stunning or stepping away from a fight can help ease a healers job.  Stuns on mobs that randomly switch targets can also be a HUGE help in controlling a pull (after being stunned the mob forgets that it was chasing some random person and goes to highest threat).   I've used the stuns from other players to hit provoke when I know my threat was getting low - and this has helped groups succeed.  There's nothing like being mid-animation and realizing that I'm going to be a tad late on blocking a spell, to see someone else stun the boss... FFS TY.

To expect the entire well-being of a group to be solely in the hands of the tank is somewhat of a ridiculous idea in this game.  Good players will actively find ways to contribute to a group.

In the absence of crafting quests it is very difficult to level crafting abilities, so I thought I would share some insights I've gained while maxing my leatherworking.

250-280: This is a grind, no two-ways about it. However, it's not as terrible as most people seem to think. Level 60 characters are still capable of farming the runes. What you need to know is that the drop rates inside instances are not heavily penalized for over level characters. This mean that Necromancer's Tomb and Sigil Adstringo are your friends. They are quick and drop a good number of the non-BAM tier 4 runes for crafting. Run them on cooldown. Archrunes of titans also do not have a heavily penalized drop rate. My favorite place to find them is the Naga Battlemasters on the north end of Serpentis Isle. It's not uncommon to get 50-100 in half an hour.

280-290: You're going to need to find some patterns here. The patterns themselves drop from Ascent of Saravash at a high rate from the Devans in the beginning and off the first boss. There's no need to go further and it shouldn't be difficult to solo. Another thing to remember is that attunement patterns will level your crafting. Rowan runes are very cheap right now and crafting and attuning items will cut down your titan rune requirement significantly.

290-320: Now you've hit it easy. Standard recipes off the vendor and likely the runes you've been hording in the bank will take care of this.

320-330: Another rough patch. You'll need to find another recipe. This time they drop out of Saleron's Sky Garden. The prions directly after the first boss will drop them and they respawn. This will be difficult solo and I've only done it as a warrior so beware.

To my knowledge the rest of the patterns you will need are plentiful on the broker and you should all know how to get a hold of tier 5 runes at this point. Happy crafting and please post any additional tips and tricks you might have here.",,False,self,t5_2s527,False,,warrior,True,t3_ue0ch,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/ue0ch/what_you_need_to_know_about_levelling_crafting/,

I was running with another guildmate and we encountered 3 sets of Unscripted players today alone in the Citadel outside Necromancer's Tomb.

Beware of these guys.  They will try and hit your lower level characters to get their points and will actively engage in GvG **BUT** if they see that they are definitely going to die and you can't kill them before they can finish typing **/gquit**, they will temporarily unguild themselves.  By quitting the guild (Only to get an invite a moment later) they are immediately removed from the GvG list and lose their PvP flag making them non-hostiles.

1327765382.0,21,self.TeraOnline,p0ji0,IAmAn experienced MMO veteran playing the Korean version of Tera Online. AMAA,30,9,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/p0ji0/iaman_experienced_mmo_veteran_playing_the_korean/,"Prepare yourself for a hearty read. I have a lot of good to say about this game.

**A little background information about me:**

I'm a college student studying Computer Science with a focus in programming. As such, I have a technical background to work from while analyzing this game. Also, I'm American and can't read Korean. That being said, I'm in a guild of 250 Americans, some of which know Korean, and there are multiple English guides online for the game.

I'm an 8-year Star Wars Galaxies veteran that achieved the rank of Jedi Knight in the FRS. For those of you that have no knowledge of that game during its early time, that was a hell of a grind. Fun, but tedious. I've played a bit of WoW, a lot of Age of Conan(or Age of Fail), and, until recently, was playing SW:TOR. I have a 50 PvP Champion on Bondar Crystal. Believe me, there's a reason why I'm playing Tera over Bioware's [TORtanic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o08e_xlXAVc), but I'll address that in another thread. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

Additionally, my computer is top-of-the-line circa 2009-2010. So far I've been able to run this game on full graphics in every zone, including dungeons and large boss fights, with 30-60 fps. My fps drops to 20 when I record live game footage with Bandicam, but I assume it's because my video card is bottle-necking my system. 

Computer Specs: 

* AMD FX-4150 Quad Core processor @ 3.6GHz
* nVidia GTX 275 - upgrading soon
* Corsair 4GB DDR3 1333MHz - upgrading soon
* Intel 320 series 120GB SSD
* 1 TB HD @ 7.2k RPM for fraps and other storage


**About the game:**

Quests and PvE are relatively simple, save for the enhanced enemy AI. Most of them involve killing monsters or enemy NPCs, but in an MMO that's a given. 

Combat is as complex as it is immersive. Critical hits from my swords fly on the screen in red explosive text, and charged arrows seem to nearly shake the screen when released. 

The graphics are as good as Skyrim's Ultra setting, if not better. There is also plenty of room for client-side visual modding, as the 3rd Unreal Engine is relatively flexible.

Class balance is a primary concern and focus of the development team. Every class is viable in both PvP and PvE. 

Character creation was in depth and complex, offering more face-detail and race customization options than Skyrim. 

The game's ""glyphing"" system, as it's called, is a talent system that allows one to expand on their skills via purchasing and activating glyphs. Every skill that you learn can be upgraded in one way or another, be it by decreasing mana cost, increasing damage, decreasing cast time, decreasing cooldown, and more. For example, my main strike that builds up mana builds 30% more per hit because I purchased a glyph and put points into it. Talent trees are non-existent, or so it seems. 

**Why Tera Online will most likely succeed in its North American release:**

* The game is fun. I mean really fun. The action MMO genre has been a joke up until now. I've played an Archer up to level 15 and my Warrior is level 27. Detail on these classes and more can be found [here](http://www.tera-online.com/content/classes) 
 
* The FPS system is fan-fucking-tastic. No longer will you have to tab target and spam buttons. It's all open-ended. Melee feels like a hack-and-slash and ranged combat requires the utmost care and dexterity. You will not get bored playing this game. While it is an FPS system, the camera always stays behind your character. But future client-side mods may change that. 

* The game itself is entirely a sandbox. Worlds are open and full of life. While different quests will take you to different zones of the game, it is relatively non-linear and truly feels like an MMO should. I have only explored around 10% of the game world, and I'm already impressed.

* The AI is as challenging as it is diverse. 

* Crafting is complex, or so it seems. I can't read Korean, but I'm told by those who can that it's great. Whenever legendary gear is crafted, it is displayed across every players screen in plain view, accompanied by a rewarding trumpet sound.

* Guilds may take over and control almost any zone of the game, promoting a very complex war-like environment. It promotes an Alliance/Enemy system amongst guilds.

* Anyone can go to war with anyone. Was one of your guild members insulted by an individual of another guild? Or maybe you just don't like the other person's goofy face. Whatever the reason, you can wage full-out war on a whim. 

* The game has a collision system amongst NPC's and characters, promoting unique and more realistic combat. 

* Class roles are more important than ever with the FPS system. For example: Heavy tanks can stand at the front line and hold up their shields via a block system, physically guarding their mages and archers behind them. 

*  The Korean version of the game has been released since January of last year. As such, it is relatively bug free and already has content patches. 

* The game revolves around end-game guild vs. guild PvP. While there are raids and dungeons that can be completed for loot, the primary focus of this game is mass PvP. 

* Tired of Alliance vs. Horde or good guys vs. bad guys? Yeah, me too. Thankfully, this game has 7 different races/factions. More information on these factions and the game's lore can be found [here](http://www.tera-online.com/content/game)

* Server load cap is insanely huge for Tera. IIRC it is well over 50,000 players. - GnomeSerial


**I'll add more information as it comes to mind. Feel free to ask me almost any. Obviously I won't be able to answer much about the crafting system.

*Edit 1: Added information about the glyphing system.

**Edit 2: Added information about server population caps",,False,self,t5_2s527,True,,,True,t3_p0ji0,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/p0ji0/iaman_experienced_mmo_veteran_playing_the_korean/,

""Quote: Runespider on 05/23/2013, 10:31 AM - view

    Maybe you aren't supposed to be able to get this mount?

    Newsflash, It's not in their interest for this to be widely owned.""

I'm coming to that conclusion as well. The question I've been asking myself is this, ""Why would Tera create an anniversary event that is so very painful to the bulk of the players?""

Yes, some folks have their routes down cold and guess what. Those folks are harvesting the spawns and as a result the spawns are not there for others to find until they respawn. There are only so many boxes popping up and they don't respawn quickly. So if you're running a regular route for the spawns you may be getting 100, 200, 300 boxes but no one else is. You're taking them all and actually that's fine because even with hundreds of boxes you're still in the low percentage rates to actually get the mount.

So why create such an event, where even if you find a box you're still looking at a very very small chance of getting a letter? Why allow the letter drop to be duplicated - how many folks have endless T's, E's, and R's but no A's?

When I first read Runespider's post I thought hmmm - conspiracy theory! Time to put on my tinfoil hat! But after listening to global chat this morning I realized that perhaps there's some truth there. I can only think that the event is NOT designed for you to get the mount.

It's designed to make you WANT the mount. And when you don't get it in the skewed event then you'll buy it in the store.

The more you search for boxes the higher your investment in having the mount rises. The more you open boxes and find a useless firework the higher your investment in having the mount rises. The more frustrated you are the more likely you are to go into the ""well it's ok I can just buy it when it shows up in the store"" category. Which is now popping up over and over in Global.

I feel like such a noob for running around looking for the boxes. If I run across one fine, but my investment of time and energy ends here. I don't play games where my odds of winning are 1% but my required investment is 100%.

And for the record, I'm a paid subscriber. I love the game but this is my first event and truthfully I feel a bit dirty now. ",,False,self,t5_2s527,False,,,True,t3_1exbvr,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/1exbvr/tinfoil_hat_on_tera_event_not_designed_to_get_you/,

(Founder Codes Prizes!!!),28,8,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/1a4dlo/no_sleep_til_60_event_founder_codes_prizes/,"Hello everyone I'm a streamer over at Twitch.tv and I just happen to have a whole bunch of Founders Codes. Like piles of them. So when I heard about this SUPER FUN event being put on for new players to come join us in Tera I figured... why not do something awesome?

So here are the rules, how to participate, and the prizes!

First you need to make a FRESH LvL 1 after the start time of the event. That means that some of you will be logging into Tera at 3AM EST (like myself). 

Here is that information: http://tera.enmasse.com/news/posts/power-level-for-prizes?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social_media&amp;amp;utm_content=031113-no-sleep-event-update-link_CTA&amp;amp;utm_campaign=news

My Event runs from 12:01 a.m. PDT, March 12 to 11:59 p.m. PDT, March 25. Image proof submissions will be accepted until March 26th 00:01AM PDT 

You will need to take a screen shot of your account before you make your new leveling character like so:
http://imgur.com/uZfU22i

Then after creation another screen shot to help verify some more:
http://imgur.com/9dYwzjv

Once you get into the game, please make sure to hover over the FPS which shows important data such as server time and time played like so:
http://imgur.com/3ZjnfQO

Then get to leveling silly! Every 10 levels make sure to stop for a moment, hover over that FPS again which shows server time, time played, take that screenshot and post it here (all in one post per person please)
http://imgur.com/90BFOrP

Everyone who participates in this event by leveling from 1 to 60 before the event ends will be entered into a drawing for at least 1 Founders Code, and some other swag from my bag 'o goodies over at twitch.tv/realblankspace. This event runs for the same amount of time as the No Sleep 'Til 60 event! Make sure to get all of your picture submission uploaded as quickly as possible. We will be closing the drawing sometime after the event is completed and we can sort through all of the submissions and verify as needed.

The amount of Founders Codes will be proportional to the number of entries! So make sure to tell your friends!

If you are interested in joining others on your server who are participating in this event please make sure to stop by the stream twitch.tv/realblankspace and ask in chat who has a guild that is accepting members for this event!

It has resulted in hundreds of players enchanting their gear to +9 and selling it on the trade broker. Frogster took over an hour to acknowledge the issue but by then the damage was done.

Players have been screaming for a rollback, however it has been stated that such a thing will not happen. https://t.co/ncX5PGPg

The forums are now awash with complaints, which will most likely be ignored. I have only just begun playing the game (have a lv30 toon) and am gutted that players will have top end gear everywhere.

It looked really cool, but I made a mistake at character creation, so I put the item in the cross-character bank, and remade my character. 

The item is unusable now. Essentially it is a wasted $10. I know it isn't much, and it is completely my fault for deleting the character... but I figured it would work on the new character as I could actually store it in the bank! If you take a look at the collector's edition items, the necklaces cannot be stored in the bank because they are bound to the one character. I used that information, and assumed it would work. I was wrong.

En Masse refuses to unbind it for me, or at least replace it with one I can equip, and they tell me to buy another one. I don't want a refund, I just want the item! I figure if I was playing WoW or something, they would at least give me one fuck up and fix it for me, but these guys won't budge.

TLDR; bought the kingsguard appearance item, deleted character, En Masse won't help me retrieve the item. 


Edit - Added links to photos of the chat with the GM. I deleted names, because I don't want to get the GM in any trouble, as I will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he is being told he can't help me.

Edit #2 - Their latest response was a copy and paste of a previous response... 

http://i.imgur.com/VH58I.jpg

Final Edit - spoke with an awesome GM on live chat and they not only fixed the situation for me, they allowed me to switch to another weapon skin if I wanted. You guys were right, submitting tickets is very impersonal and easy for them to say no. A live chat, on the other hand, helps get someone with experience in good customer service.

1335914862.0,22,self.TeraOnline,t2bss,Debilitate Numbers - Lancers must read!,26,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/t2bss/debilitate_numbers_lancers_must_read/,"For those who don't know what this skill is, Lancers get it at lv. 28 and it has the following effect:
&gt;Briefly weaken the endurance of your foes by 3%. Effect stacks up to three times.

It's on a 3.5s cooldown and the effect lasts for 12s.

When I first saw Debilitate, I assumed it was like any other sunder armour and should be kept at 100% uptime during boss fights.  Watching some level 60 Hard Mode stuff, I noticed the tank wasn't keeping it up, so I thought maybe the 9% Endurance decrease on your target wasn't worth it.

I just ran some tests, and here are the numbers.  This is at lv. 44 Slayer doing damage to a lv. 40 Ovolith.  For the Crit numbers, he was using 2 Critical Damage increase Glyphs.  It's important to note that the numbers themselves aren't the focus, it's the *difference* between them that is worth noting.  *(DB = Debilitate)*

                 No DB, Non-Crit	3x DB, Non-Crit	   No DB, Crit   3x DB, Crit
    AA (3rd Hit)	   700	             1,000		
    Heart Thrust	   7,800	         9,800	         30,000	        35,000
    Knockdown Strike                                     20,000	        25,000


As you can see, the difference is pretty significant.  This is only at level 44, at the difference (between no stacks and 3) will only widen as Crit rates and base damage get higher. 

If you consider 3 DPS attacking a boss for 5 minutes, and they're gaining a ~5k damage increase every 10 seconds from 3x Debilitate, you gain 450,000 damage.  These numbers will be much larger at max level with proper Glyphs/Crystals on your DPS.

tl;dr

* Debilitate should be kept at 3 stacks 100% of the time during boss fights.
* Glyph of Impulsion gives a 35% chance to eliminate it's MP cost.
* Glyph of Lingering increase the duration of the debuff by 100%.
* **Glyph of Lingering** is an absolute must use.  It's very possible to keep the debuff up without it, but the breathing room the glyph allows for boss movement/mechanics is a huge and it will guarantee 100% uptime.

*Please keep in mind these concepts are from a min/maxer point of view.  If you don't share that mindset, feel free to use whatever glyphs/abilities you want!*

I will be testing some more later with a Berserker, and will update this post with numbers.

Just posting this here so I can ask you guys to proof-read / edit if I overlooked something. 

Also if somebody knows how to format stuff better that would be great. Not sure if the sections should be ordered in importance or something...

Feel free to add more stuff to it so long as 

1. It is relevant to very low levels. So I'm talking lv1~15.

2. Keep the answers brief. 

3. It isn't big enough to be a page on its own and doesn't fit in the other pages. There is some overlap with the leveling tips page.

----------------------------
There are some shit people in this subreddit, downvoting anyone that responds with actual facts about how to avoid hitting any of the grind limits. And upvotes for anyone that just whines and bitches. It is extremely annoying and we as a community should be better than this.
God save me from some aspects of the MMO community. You people are impossible. You have ruined a ton of AAA games in the last few years - you DEMAND treadmill gated endgame, beat it in a month, and then whine and abandon a game for not having enough content (you all know exactly the games I am talking about). Now a game has to literally FORCE you to stop doing the same mindless activity over and over and actually do different things to enjoy endgame, and you all bitch and whine because you can't grind yourself to boredom in a month like you have done with every other MMO.
You are destroying the viability of MMOs by being entitled impatient kids who can't make fun for yourself, you have to have a game hand it all to you on a silver platter and whine and bitch if you don't get it fast enough, or complain because you have to work hard to get something you want because they won't let you run the easiest dungeon over and over or run the same dynamic event over and over. Fuck everyone whining about this.
You all keep acting like this, you realize NO MMO WILL EVER SATISFY YOU. You will buy a new MMO, play it for a month - bitch and whine - and then abandon it and the company will lose money. What will happen in 5-10 years? Nobody will be making MMOs anymore, because they will simply not be profitable.
Maybe the problem isn't the MMO, maybe the problem is you. Maybe you need to examine the way you approach an MMO - many of you will spend hours playing a FPS with no progression because it is fun - and then you whine because spvp has no progression and say so ""what incentive do I have to do spvp if I don't get better gear?"" (Actual statement I have heard).
Many of you will spend hours exploring the world in Skryim, doing tons of side-quests, and yet whine and complain because all there is to do in GW2 is explore the world and run dungeons and do events. That is like rushing to finish the storyline quests in Skyrim and then complaining that the game has almost no content.
Why can't we as an MMO community take the attitude we bring to FPS games, RPG games, and apply it to an MMO? Too many damn players feel like the only thing that motivates them in an MMO is the ""carrot"" of gear always being held out in front of them (and don't know what to do with themselves without it) - and you are destroying the genre. You need to fix that shit before you destroy the genre that we love.
We take the attitude of playing games for FUN in almost every other genre, so why can't we do it for MMOs too?

Honestly, tera was hard as shit but people complain nonstop about game mechanics and every patch they nerfed or buffed something to oblivion. They made warrior tanks easy mode, they gave insane damage buffs for queuing/just random pots, buffed crystals, nerfed dungeons EVERY patch repeatedly.

Please know that we are actively working to resolve them and will provide updates on the TERA website as they happen. For quicker updates, feel free to visit us on our Twitter and Facebook pages.

After working on these top priority issues for a day, we have a few updates. We have stopped these errors from occurring for new players, meaning that the support queues will subside and you'll be able to be helped faster.

Parallel to this fix, we're manually correcting the issue on existing accounts. Additionally, we're exploring options for a global solution. In the meantime, if you are encountering the ""Server Error 500"" or subscription-related issues, please contact our Support Team. They'll be glad to help you. 

In the interest of transparency, you should know that it will take up to two days to manually resolve this issue for all accounts affected by it.

Lancer:
You shouldnt really even consider yourself a tank until level 18. Challenging Shout is your primary threat generator. It's significant, should be using it every 10 seconds. Use Shield Bash every C/D followed by Shout or Spring Attack. Whenever you can, use your basic attack to get MP back. Dont use Second Wind in combat unless you're sure that you're safe.

Glyph Mana Return to your combo attack right away. Dont glyph threat to your combo attack, it's too small to matter. Glyph Shield Bash Cooldown and +threat to challenging shout and Shield Counter ASAP. Glyph C/D to Retaliate when you can.

Get +threat on weapon crystal, I found a +11% very early on. +Health and +MP5 are great additions.

Warrior:
Use Torrent of Blows every C/D. Use Smoke Aggressor every C/D  on bosses or duing mass little mob pulls (make sure you have the health available). Dont use Battle Cry every C/D, the C/D is too long, you'll need it for oh crap moments. Pounce is 50% less damage during the entire animation, careful usage is key. Raising Fury is decent threat and 20% less damage. Threat is much easier to hold on a warrior.

Good movement is key as a warrior. You can dodge left and right instead of through the monster, gives your DPS an easier time positioning. When smoke aggressor is up, you still need to be building threat. Smoke aggressor takes time to get used too. You can move during casting, get used to figuring out how to drop it off correctly.

Be very careful with Rain of Blows. It commits you to an action for a very long time with no damage reduction.

Warrior tanking gets easier at 26. Plan to Glyph Death from Above for c/d straight away.

If you can keep up Combative Strike and Traverse Cut, things will die quicker.

Glyph retaliate c/d straight away, as well as defensive stance. Then +mp on basic attack and threat on torrent of blows. Smoke Aggressor c/d is very useful.",,False,self,t5_2s527,False,,lancer,True,t3_qxu30,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/qxu30/tera_tanking/,

We want this to expand and be a good go to place for FAQ’s that we see here on our subreddit we as a community can point new users to for common question like “So, I just installed TERA and I played X in game Y what class is most like X?”, “What are each classes is the easiest to solo content in TERA?” or “Whats PVP like in TERA?” These I would have to say are the most common questions we see weekly if not daily that we should be able to create these rather quickly. After we get some of these FAQ type questions knocked out go nuts create guides for reputation, hitting 60, dungeons, nexus whatever! 
  
Currently the only requirements to post in the wiki are a reddit account for 60 days and you must have 10 karma within the subreddit. We will monitor this closely and if things get out of hand we will be forced increase the karma requirement or account age requirement.  
  
We hope this will be beneficial to the TERA community at large as well as our subreddit.

Post them if you got them.,27,5,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/17tlgx/tips_for_new_players_post_them_if_you_got_them/,"With a likely influx of F2P players I felt that I should post what small things I've learned in the past month of playing.  Feel free to correct me, I don't have much experience with the game yet.

* To claim items from special editions or other rewards: Hit escape, go to the Activities Menu (Angel Icon), and click Item Claim.

* You can add crystals to your weapon to enhance damage, regenerate HP/MP, improved criticals, and other bonuses.  Crystal merchants will sell cheap crystals, specialty merchants will sell more expensive ones with better benefits.

* Tera works great with a controller.  I use a PS3 controller (With MotionJoy) and enjoy it greatly.  L2, R2, and L2+R2 will each change the main 4 buttons into different commands.  Expand the tray (Button in the top right of tray with two small squares) to see the ability slots that L2+R2 would use.

* If you have a physical copy of the game you can enter the code on the site backwards to get some scrolls, a 280 speed mount, and emeralds which can vendor for 2000 gold.  I played for a week before finding this out.

* Fall damage can't kill you

* You can hold the pickup button to pickup multiple items without having to spam it.

* Teleport Masters are great, will get you around the zones quickly, and are highly recommended.

* If you pass on instantly teleporting to the instance when using the LFG tool ~~you won't be able to get that option again~~.  You will have to 1) run to the instance, or 2) Warp to town and purchase a teleport scroll, **GuyWithFace adds 3) ""if you click the option that's not ""warp now"" or whatever, you can click on the Dungeon Finder button below the minimap to teleport to the dungeon.""

* You can use armor/weapons you don't need in four ways.  Vendoring, Auctioning, Extracting, and Enchanting Fodder.  Vendoring is likely the least helpful since there is always a need for enchanting fodder being sold on Auction and you'll get more for it.

* You can quickly change channels by clicking the Ch. # in the top right corner and select the one you want.  This is great when questing and the place you want is too crowded and you can't get anything done.

So alone, for the last 20% of the boss' health I have to fight solo (having my rez on cd from saving someone's ass earlier).

- Pre-Order Digital Collectors from you guys
- Level a 22 on Head Start (open Beta Weekend)
- Cancel Pre-Order because I Pre-Order at a local store for the box version because I really love this game
- Head Start weekend could not get onto my server period and told me to play another server.
- Few days later when there was no Queue on my server I found out my 22 was deleted.
- Went to pick up my pre-order and find out the idiot local shop sold out... Forgot to keep enough for pre-orders.
- Bought Collectors from here again.
- Played but got DCed every 5-10 minutes really odd the game seems to derp my router out for some odd reason not your fault I think.
- All my pre-order bonuses are gone
- Woke up logged in and account expired due to this sub bug now..


Now if this was World of Warcraft or almost 95% of the other companies on the internet I would have done a chargeback and raged so hard.

But from what I seen and how helpful they been so far to the players in a whole I feel that my issue will get resolved. I will never be able to turn the clock back and I'm not going be able to catch up and nor will I be the first at anything now. But because the way they have treated me and many others I just feel like I'm part of something special and unique. I have never experienced this kind of service on the internet for about 10 years now.

Self posts, link posts, comments, everything is needed. (Please keep it SFW, and at least somewhat on topic.)

Your feedback at this stage is crucial, as it will help us find problems and make changes before we roll anything out to the main subreddit.

Heavymetal was my first character, and I'm glad I chose that class: I like the role that tanking has in dungeons, and this is the same for my warrior as well.

Oreos was my second character, and having all that Lancer experience made it difficult to adjust at first-- but vital when I suddenly found myself tanking SM while being DPS specced a couple of times.  Not all that complicated to tank that dungeon, it was a fun learning experience! (I have no knowledge of future dungeons after this one though. :b)  But playing a warrior gave me better appreciation of lancer positioning during group play.  I didn't realize it until I was already too invested in the character, but somehow I ended up choosing the deepest voice for this elin.  It's hilarious and terrifying.

I started a Berserker to level up with a friend playing a Slayer-- we find ourselves crazily grabbing all the nearby quest mobs and slaying them all at once!  I have yet to do the first dungeon with her, though.       The whole mass-slaughter effect makes it fun to do quests that way.  XD

We will be working together to add our info/roster on their website as well which can be found here: http://www.territ.us/

I have copied some of their post so that I could make sure I had all the information in it. I hope they don't mind! 

My aim is the exact same as theirs. I have actively been on this subreddit for quite some time now and want to see the TERA community as well as this subreddit grow. 

**General information**

With the recent F2P announcement, there are a lot of new and returning faces. Many of you will be looking for people to play with, and that's where Territ comes in.
We can help you find party members to run dungeons, complete quests, or compete in battlegrounds. We can also give you some friendly people to chat with while you play.
To join Territ, you must be on the **PvE server (""Tempest Reach"")**. While in-game, press Esc to switch to UI mode and go to Social Menu -&gt; Guilds On Server. In the Guild Name box, type in 'Territ' and click Search. Finally, click on 'Apply to Guild' and either myself or a moderator will accept you :)
We'll take anyone at any level, whether you're brand new or you've been playing since beta. Territ's only rule is, and has always been, ""Don't be a dick!"" If you think you can handle that, we'd love to have you! I, personally, have been around since head start and although I don't have a max level character on the PvE server, I do study the game and will try my hardest to help whoever is in need. We have a **Ventrillo** server at **TX2.LeetVent.com:3806** that any current or prospective member is welcome to use. There is currently no password on the server and this will remain the case as long as the server isn't abused. Be advised, it is only a 75 person server atm as this is all I can afford. If in the future it is not enough room and someone is willing to help with funds I'd be all for increasing the capacity.

**Guild Bank:** If you see something you would like in the guild bank, just ask in /g and a moderator will almost certainly fetch it for you.

I know we are not full yet, but I figured I would put this information in here anyways. We are going to have a 2 character limit to start out with. If it turns out to be not as popular as the PvP server then we will increase those numbers. But, to start out with only 2 character in the guild! Thanks!

Main characters will be accepted over alt characters if application messages specify such. 

After the first week of free to play, we will return to our previous method of kicking characters that have been inactive for 2-3 weeks. We will not kick for inactivity during the time frame between this free week and free to play as that would be unfair to people who either did not renew their subscription or were on the trial but will want to continue playing. We measure inactivity by looking at the ""Last online"" column in the guild list -- simply logging in to the game on your character will reset your inactivity timer.",,False,self,t5_2s527,1358730490.0,,,True,t3_16yhw9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/16yhw9/reddit_guild_now_recruiting_on_tempest_reach_pve/,

Also there seems to be many times the amount of video footage out there for GW2 than there is Tera.

The game looks quite beautiful, and it seems like it'd be fun to play.  I just don't understand why people, the press, and the company behind it aren't publicizing the game more.

I've noticed that many EU players, including me and a friend of mine, are thinking on moving over to NA servers (yes, Frogster is doing such an amazing job! /sarcasm). However, playing with VERY high latency isn't good at all. If you didn't play on NA betas and wanna test your connection before Head Start / Launch, follow the following steps (special thanks to GM Athyrlea who helped me through live support!).

* Download the [diagnostic tool](http://download.enmasse.com/diag.zip) found [here](https://tera-support.enmasse.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/216/kw/diagnostic).
* Run it, and let it do the test. After it's done, click on the button to save results to desktop. It will create a .txt file with detailed results.
* Browse the file and search for ""CONNECTIVITY TESTS""
* You'll find ""enmasse port"" values (80, 443 and 10001) - those values should be **below** 0.3 (after 0.3 it gets very laggy). If they are below 0.3, you should be able to play it fine (depends on how close to 0.3 they are - the lowest, the better)  
  
Also, try to grab one of those [ Head Start Buddy Codes](http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/ssftl/tera_head_start_buddy_codes/), in case you haven't pre-ordered yet, and check it for yourself on head start (already got mine :P). Hope this helps you deciding where you'll play ;)

I'm tired of samey, easy WoW clones. I'm tired of MMOs with nonexistent economies and social aspect other than general chat, and I'm *especially* tired of being able to pay little to no attention to the game I'm playing and still succeed.
 
Now, I haven't played TERA, but I am really looking-- squinting and shielding my eyes-- forward to the day I'll be able to, because if it lives up to BHE/EME's promises and how fun the gameplay videos I've watched look, it is literally everything I'm looking for in an MMO. 

That said, why don't more people know about it? Surely, I'm not alone in how I like my games.

I'm of the opinion that En Masse needs to kick their marketing into high gear right now to generate enough good hype for release. Correct me if I'm wrong, but in the West, Korean MMOs in general, let alone those with quiet overseas launches, don't have a history of faring well. I've tried to show TERA to my SWTOR guild, and I've noticed that when the word ""Korean"" precedes ""MMO,"" it becomes a dirty word. Everyone just immediately shuts down and dismisses the game as a standard grindfest, and many Korean games are. (Aion, anyone? Ugh.)

Okay, I think I'm done ranting.

Anyway, what's keeping EME from publicizing this game more? Are there plans in the works to ramp it up as release draws nearer? I just think that TERA has so much potential and it would be a crying fucking shame to see it fail due to poor/not enough marketing.

I'm going to split this into offense and defense sections, but the basic principle is pretty simple.  I commit the bulk of the force to the positions that are usually the hottest (i.e. mid pyre), with the rest holding key choke-points or providing artillery support. Additionally, this strategy is rather conservative, but has proven effective so far - even if more aggressive tactics  (i.e. Zerging a ladder) do result in faster wins on the occasion that they work.

**Offense**

***Opening maneuvers: 15:00 to ~12:30***

* 4 DPS and 1 healer (usually me) in south airship, to attempt to “ninja” the crystal.  Priest is preferable over mystic here IMO because of the ability to throw Kaia's shield upon landing.  If this airship is shot down or the team is killed upon dropping, they join the main assault force from south pyre.  If they survive, simply hit the crystal (Anchorstone) until they clear you out or you win.

* 1 person, doesn't matter who, launches north airship a few seconds before south to act as a decoy, joining the main force once killed.

* The other 14 should hit South gate like a fucking freight train, bringing it down ASAP.

* Tanks shoot at cannons/mid pyre to suppress enemy sieges and keep some heat off the airships and attacking team.

* Once the south gate's HP is low, tanks move in to support infantry and help for the next maneuver.

***Assault on Central Pyre (Mid): ~12:30 to ~11:00***

* Once the south gate is down, all 20 teammates rush up the ramp to mid pyre

* 2 tanks roll up to mid to support the push and one moves into courtyard.

* It is very rare that a defending team is equipped and positioned to handle a 20-man armored assault, so mid pyre usually falls in about 30-45 seconds.

* The rest of this time is spent clearing out and stragglers and moving all tanks to the inner gate.

***Assault on Inner Gate/Anchorstone: ~11:00 to ~08:30***

* Once mid is secured and artillery is positioned in the courtyard, the cannons and tanks begin bombarding the Inner gate/walls.

* Meanwhile, all 15 or so infantry are executing a rolling rush on the gate, spawning from mid to defend it on occasion and keeping constant pressure up between respawn waves.

* Once the inner gate falls, everyone Zerg rushes the crystal (Anchorstone).  Don't stop to fight defenders, **the crystal is priority**.

* Tanks bombard crystal/defenders in the room though the door.

* Keep pressure up until the round ends.


**Defense**

You may have noticed that I made no mention of scanning in the offense section, and that is because I feel it is largely unnecessary when assaulting.  I will throw in a scan or two every so often, but I'm not using it on CD unless the enemy is behaving abnormally.  On defense, the leader should be scanning *as often as possible* and directing auxiliary troops to hotspots.  Doing so will preserve you defensive assets (gates and cannons) for longer, which is very helpful in assuring a win.

Note that I will not be including times here, as my defensive strategy is relatively static and there is only one major maneuver after the initial positions are taken up, which will be explained below.

***Opening seconds/Initial Positioning***

As you may have noticed from my explanation above, Mid Pyre is a critical objective for any attacking team that wants to take down the inner gate.  Therefore, much of the defensive effort will be concentrated on holding mid.  However, there is another objective which, IMO, is more important, and that is adequately defending the inner ladders.  Strategy to follow:

* 4 Ranged DPS on the inner wall, preferably one archer and one sorc per ladder
* One zerk in inner wall for backup if a moderate push is made on either inner ladder.

*I always call for these players by name before the round begins, they tend to hold their posts better than simply calling for a class to stick a ladder.

* One healer should stay inner as well. I always fill this role in my BG's, which enables me to focus almost entirely on leading and directing support instead of combat.

* One *competent* person takes the tank on inner and helps shoot down the airships; the 4 outer defenders (explained later) stay on inner to repel an airdrop should the sieges miss.

Note that the inner defenders (aside from the auxiliary team, which moved out after the airdrop) should be holding static positions **for the duration of the round, no matter what.**  This is a tedious role, but an absolutely critical one in this strategy.

* 10 men move to mid ASAP and hold it, with tank and cannons providing support.

* The remaining 4 defenders take positions on the outer ladders and provide auxiliary support for mid if needed.  Note that these players should stay on the inner wall until the airships have been successfully destroyed or the airdrop repelled.

* In the event that an outer gate is destroyed, the outer defenders on that side abandon that section of wall and retreat to mid to help defend against the inevitable rush.

* If mid pyre is successfully controlled for the entire round, these positions remain static; nobody deviates from their assigned objective unless Leader issues a new directive. 

***Turtle Mode (AKA “Oh-shit-halp-we-losing-wat-do Defense Mode”)***

In the event that mid pyre is lost, the entire team except for a couple of random harassers retreats to the inner castle.  This occurs in around half of my BG's, usually with about 3-4 minutes remaining in the round.

* One additional DPS moves to each inner ladder-top, bringing the total to 6 DPS, one healer, one zerk, and the tank on inner wall.

* The other 11 or so people spawn on inner and harass the infantry trying to break down the gate by either jumping off the wall and fighting in courtyard or shooting through the gate with AoE's.

* Once the Inner Gate falls to 40% HP, the harassers retreat to the crystal room and prepare to stop a rush.

* The tank moves downstairs to physically block the door way should the gate fall.

* I will generally head downstairs as well at this point, but the zerk and anged DPS ladder guards hold their positions *no matter what*, barring Leader's adapting the plan.

Usually, a well coordinated team will have the gate up and defended until about 2:00 remaining, assuming my strategy was implemented first round so that the defense lasts roughly 7-9 minutes..

The attackers' first rush can be repelled with usually only minor damage to the crystal, while the successive waves are a bit hairier.  If there are 3 minutes or less in the round and the tank is blocking the doorway, defenders can hold out for the balance with ease.  If longer, you've got your work cut out for you, but it is doable assuming the enemy is brought down quickly upon reaching the crystal.

In general, my teams will win with either a perfect score or approximately 5000HP remaining on the crystal by the end of round 2.

**Additional Notes/General Tips/Et Cetera**

* This guide was written assuming that you are spawning attack side first.  If you intend to implement this strategy on a defensive initial spawn, simply adopt the same tactics and victory is reasonably within your grasp, especially if the defense holds for a full 15:00, which in my case it most often does.

* Co-operation is absolutely key in CS; kills have no direct bearing on wins/losses, so lone-wolfing it only hurts and frustrates your team. Please follow the leaders directives.

* Communicating with your teammates goes hand-in-hand with cooperating, and is absolutely key to a smooth Battleground run.  Call out incoming enemies in /ra with a number and location (i.e. 3 incoming south inner) and don't hesitate to call for help if your area is getting overwhelmed.  This allows other players to better assist you and provides critical information to your leader which assists him in making effective decisions.

* In the event that you intend to lead a CS run, which you should be equipped for after reading this and playing 15-20 or so rounds, issue commands in a clear and polite way.  People don't like being shouted at, and respond much more positively to being asked or politely ordered to do something than to being treated like an idiot.  I have quite a bit of personal experience with communicating in the manner as a coxswain on my University rowing team, and for a number of years prior; the same principles that apply to my rowers work just fine leading a raid or BG in Tera.

* Personally, my general syntax looks like this:  “3 DPS to the north inner ladder please.”  If the command is ignored I will call 3 DPS players by name to report to the north inner ladder, which looks like “Player 1, 2 and 3 please report to the north inner ladder ASAP.”  If this command is ignored, I drop  the polite act and say something along the lines of “3DPS to north inner IMMEDIATELY! We're vulnerable there!”  If this is ignored, chances are you've got a team of assholes, and can begin cursing out people until they fall in line, although always try to present a mature and collected persona along with demonstrating your anger.

*I do intend to edit this guide with additional, more specific information as well as alternative strategies in the future, so please feel free to contribute any information you feel I have overlooked or left out.  Thanks for reading!*

I know lots of people know how to this, but many people seem unfamiliar with metal extraction and alchemy and don't use scrolls in pve combat, so I figured I'd type this up to help people!


Apologies in advance to anyone that has a scroll monopoly on their servers. :S


One of the best ways I've found to make scrolls is by extracting t 11/12/13 gear for metal ingots! This is a painless way to get rid of those drops that most people pass on in dungeons and make them into something super useful!


Step 1: Level alchemy to 250. Go to a crafting board and pick up the alchemy quest. Do the quests to level up alchemy. It should take about 20 minutes or less and less than 200g! Learn the scroll recipes you want when you hit 250.


Step 2: Level your metal extraction. Go to a general goods merchant and buy the METAL extraction recipes. Start with metal extraction tier 1 and work your way to 13. You don't need to extract anything to level it up, just learn each scroll.


Step 3: Acquire/Extract your t11/12/13 gear. This gear drops in virtually any end game dungeon and nexus. While some pieces of gear may sell well as templates on the broker, I'm too lazy to try and sell them so I just extract everything. :S


In terms of what gives the most xersteel ingots, it goes Weapon &gt; chest &gt; gloves = boots. For quality of item, Yellow &gt; Blue &gt; Green &gt; White. A Yellow (Superior) weapon will give around 150 xersteel ingots! On the other hand, white boots might give you 2 xersteel ingots. Occasionally, extraction will fail and you'll get nothing.

Step 4: Craft your scrolls! Note: If you want scroll of dash, you'll have to use swiftness potions (I KNOW, they're actually useful for something!)


I usually get most of my t11/12/13 fodder from duoing KN/ET/LoT while farming mes/mwa. Lots of people also tend to pass on it in Nexus cuz they're scared of wasting a good roll on these tiers as well!

My question is, will entering the product key I received from Amazon into an En Masse account start the 30-day free time immediately? It would be a waste if this is so as I can't play right now.

A secondary question is, I've heard that to be eligible for the Golden Weapon skins I have to have subscribed before May 31st. Will subscribing start the 30-day free time immediately?

I'm having an unexplained issue with the game that Mods, my ISP and a few days of troubleshooting have not fixed. Also found some interesting temporary solutions, please read on if you want to try to help me!

Alright. So this is not your ordinary problem. My computer has some pretty good specs, all of which surpass the recommended settings by far, and I don't drop ANY frames on the highest detail. It has been established that this is not a problem with the capability of my hardware. 

The problem isn't any kind of frame lag, it's a type of disconnection lag that seems to happen almost all the time. I can log in no problem, but as soon as I'm logged in, my shit will just freeze. I can run around but I can't use skills, get on mount, jump, etc. After a few days of crying about it with my boyfriend, I decided I would not give up. I contacted a few of the GMs through livechat; GM Chad- who told me I had no problems, and GM Cahir- who told me I was dropping packets and needed a hard modem reset from my ISP (Time Warner).

Now, I've never had ANY lag problem ever with ANY other game on high settings. This includes Vindictus/Starcraft 2/League of Legends, which further adds to my frustration. So, after the hard Modem reset obviously did not work, I traded in my old modem for a brand new one, and doubled my speed to 20/2, hopefully figuring this would eliminate the problem (I'm not specifically tech savvy, don't kill me, it was free.)

This did not solve the problem. I did what GM Cahir asked and it did not work. Out of frustration, I opened Tera one last time before laying it down for a while, whilst having Youtube open to a video. I logged in and was lag free.

I found out that somehow youtube is fixing the problem I'm having. However, if I close youtube, Tera will stop working again and do the disconnect thingy again. I don't neccessarily need to be listening to anything, but if it's not open, Tera will refuse to work.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I ask you, r/TeraOnline, do any of you have any idea just what the FUCK is happening to my game? Why is youtube fixing the problem? What the hell is wrong with my computer (I guess that's the only thing left the blame?) Let me stress that this is NOT in any way fps lag. It's pure d/c, as in, I can see standing animations, but everything just stops moving. 

tl;dr: stupid person can't figure out why youtube is fixing a disconnect problem. help!

I'll post my comp specs later, currently about to type a paper right at the deadline because Tera.

FUN NOTE: if i don't have youtube open, and I press o (options window), it will actually pick back up for a moment and spam everything that happened while i was lagging for a moment, the drop back off again. (until I press o again, LOL.)

UPDATE: Specs:

Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 3401 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)

Installed Physical Memory (RAM): 8.00 GB

AMD Radeon HD 6700 Series (1GB)

anything else I should put here?

Small Update: If the problem can't be solved, I don't think it matters too much, this YouTube solution thing seems to be working and consistent.

(Will have xpost on EU forums) (LONG POST WARNING)",25,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/185kfe/open_constructive_letter_to_the_tera_team_at/,"Written aimed at the Gameforge Tera Development and Localization team.

I am referring to something you must know for days by now: You are currently not competitive with the version hosted by EnMasse at all. You have finally got the exact same content patch out (we used to lack chronoscrolls at the very least), but now you're making mistakes with the cash shop? Why would you limit the things you throw on the cash shop this much, I truly wonder, I assume you do like selling things, yes? And a second problem I will adress, the interaction with the community is really poor at times.

Following are some things I believe would improve your game drastically, and perhaps stop the flow of players to the version hosted in NA, by EnMasse. The better timezones and reduced latency, and the german and french localization, are currently the only reasons you have any players at all, and why people are still around. This is obviously not a good thing. **Please at least try to be competitive with the version hosted by EME, that is supposed to co-exist!**

**This is going to be a long LOOOOOONG post, to explain my points. The above is pretty much a ""TLDR"", and is enough to get what the rest of the post is going to say, but here is the full version for those patient enough to read through all of it:**

**ISSUE 1:**

NA/EnMasse cash shop has MUCH more items in it. Probably about 10 times as much, maybe even more. You have seen the screenshots of this shop by now, no doubts. You are the publisher of the game: Updates come from Bluehole, right? Why did you guys only implement, or receive, this small an amount of items? Or is EnMasse itself making all those items, and not Bluehole? Unless EnMasse itself has a dev-team working on it, and you guys only receive a small selection from Bluehole (which would definitely suck for you guys), there is no reason you shouldn't put those things in. The age-rating thing can hardly be related to that, nor can the language, as for as far as I know you guys are the ones that are making the language-based adaptations for the content, right? And we'd only be talking names of items here with cash-shop items.

What to do? Add more items to the Cash Shop. Gameforge CM Raven posted ""we'll continuously add more"", which you should of course, if everyone bought everything you'd not be able to sell anything. But at the moment, we don't need individual (/ small sets of) items being added in over time, we need a MASSIVE increase in the amount of items, otherwise people will simply leave to the other version of Tera if they wish to have more choice, and if they do not mind the lag of course. And even if you're going to be adding those items in we are behind: Please stop releasing a major patch when not everything is done, as it creates a negative feeling in your playerbase. You could've even just announced the release date of this F2P patch to be a week or 2 later, if you didn't have stuff done, that wouldn't have lost you any significant amount of players at all to the US base. You saw EnMasse delaying the cash shop by 4 days, and there was nothing wrong with that.


**ISSUE 2:** (I wanted to make this 3, but the next one is so long, that I decided to make it the second)

The communication between the Gameforge team and the playerbase (I refuse to call it a community due to the definition of the word, but if you like to call it a community, sure, read ""the community"" instead.), is just not too great.

First of all, there is no good way to keep up with most news, and your official stance on things, unless we bookmark the profiles of all your employees and look at their recent posts. A tool looking up all the recent posts, or even making newsposts with your statements (much) more often, would fix some of this. However, most third-party websites that tracked official responses, are no longer functional, and you do not have a big fansite like for example Blizzard has in MMO-Champion, that track this stuff for you. Allowing people to browse through official responses would make communication MUCH better.

The other thing is 2 parts that influence eachother: A: The responses from official employees tend to always be very short and/or vague, except for maybe here and there a few insightful posts explaining some things. B: Your official forums tend to not be a pleasant place to read through.

I have to admit, you're getting way more hateful and non-constructive critique from some of your players than I have ever seen the publishers/developers of a game get. The reason they have to make these posts is usually valid, but there is a lot of whining. The responses given in return aren't very great either though, as mentioned before. Communication between Gameforge and the playerbase just seems to be very difficult.

Now on the other side, we have EnMasse being on the exact other end of the spectrum: People are raving about them (in a sense that they are generally considered the best in the world by their players), their employees post in a very light-hearted fashion, and they even take to Reddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/) to clarify things here and there. Why Reddit? Because the constructive and most-agreed-upon criticism or comments are visible on top, and the trollish/flaming ones on bottom, or not at all, and this gives for a great place to have self-moderated discussion. Obviously, they take it a bit far, and I'm not saying you should start answering questions on Reddit that in reality should have be sent to customer support, or pay more attention to it than to your own forums. And I think it's impossible to post in a manner that is as cheerful as the EME guys do it of course. But you could at least try and engage a little bit more in discussion on your forum where the comments are constructive, or make singular replies on Reddit to matters that seem to bother the playerbase a lot.

I think this will make the playerbase a lot happier, and will make people feel less ignored, as it at the moment feels like it's impossible to communicate our concerns. Forums are nice, but if they are poorly moderated, or do not get useful developer/producer conversation, they could just as well be the forums of a mediocre fansite. (and yes there will always be some vocal whiny or trollish people on forums.)

This covers 154 episodes, each roughly a half hour long.
Total, the videos take 79 hours, 20 min, and 46 seconds.
I omitted small sections between videos that involved trade broker stuff and vendoring, but I included all of my questing and gameplay.
I uploaded the first video on May 10th, and the 'last' on October 22.
I record in 1080p, so each episode is ~20Gb before I compress and process it; after processing the episodes are usually about 7Gb and I only keep the compressed version due to space.
All 154 Episodes, compressed, are currently taking up 1094Gb across two HDDs.

This is the first major Let's Play style project that I've done, and it feels good to be done both with leveling and with this project. I certainly feel like i've gotten better since I started, though I know that I still can improve. I think that as time permits, I may make a few additional videos for things that I do at level 60, but that's all in the future.

A friend told me about Tera today and it looks pretty awesome so I figured I'd check it out.  I tried to buy it from En Masse, but the store seems to be down and giving me ""Error Number:  SYS_000001"" (it's been like that all day).  

I can be patient while they get their store back online so I figured I'd check out the demo instead.  The ""Instant Demo"" link on the site fails telling me I don't meet the bandwidth requirements to play.  That's weird since I'm on 200M fiber and it's not uncommon for me to see download speeds of 15MB/s or higher.  Since that didn't work, I decided to create an account and use the TERATRIAL code to download the trial.  I created an account, added the code, and then got an error saying ""Your account is not allowed to make purchases at this time."".  Huh?  I tried to create a public name so I could join the forums and I got ""This account cannot be updated at this time"".  WTF?

&gt;&gt;Playing TERA outside of North America


&gt;&gt;If you want to play TERA with friends in another country, here’s what you need to know:



&gt;&gt;You can play TERA on En Masse servers from North America, South America, Europe and Oceania.

&gt;&gt;En Masse has a license to operate TERA game servers in North America. This means that if you are in North America, South America, Europe (excluding Russia), and Oceania (Australia, New Zealand, Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia) you can play on En Masse Servers.



&gt;&gt;TERA is being published by En Masse in North America and by Frogster in Europe.

&gt;&gt;You don’t need to be located in North America to play on North American servers but you do need to purchase TERA through its North American publisher, En Masse, and register it to your En Masse account. Check out how to set up an En Masse account.



&gt;&gt;To play on European servers, you need to purchase and register TERA through its European publisher, Frogster.  You’ll find Frogster at http://frogster.eu/en/products_tera.html

&gt;**No Nickname Set:** Yep, that's what I'm trying to do.  ""purchase TERA through its North American publisher, En Masse, and register it to your En Masse account""

&gt;**GM Cindlebell:** yeah but you live in japan

&gt;**No Nickname Set:** It says ""You don’t need to be located in North America to play on North American servers ""

&gt;**No Nickname Set:** I mean, if me being in Japan is going to be a huge issue, that's fine.  I'm not going to push it.  I just wanted to try the game out and probably end up buying it (although the store seems to be down, but I could wait)

&gt;**GM Cindlebell:** i dont know but i know if you access it from over there it will ban you. you need the tera-europe.com

&gt;**No Nickname Set:** Yeah, I heard some pretty bad things about Frogster or whatever they're called.  I think I'll just play a different game.  Thanks though.  I might be moving back to the US later this year anyway so I'll just try the game out then.

&gt;**GM Cindlebell:** cool. :) have a great day!

I'm used to having issues with paying for things online due to being located in Japan with a US billing address on my card and I'm used to having to jump through hoops for my PSN and XBL accounts due to them not supporting the ""AP"" state (it's a state designation for overseas military.  It's as good as a domestic US address), but this is the first time I've ever been banned from a service immediately after creating account just for being here.  That's beyond lame.

Edit:  Now that I think about it, if I start playing when I do go back to the US, what happens when I eventually have to move back to Japan after a couple years?  Another insta-ban?

First off, I'll say that I -myself- don't have any issues with the difficulty.  But then again, I've been playing MMOs since EQ1, as well as many other games.  Rather, this conversation is more geared towards more casual players, such as my girlfriend and others.  

From level 1-59, the game isn't bad at all.  Instances are fun and not terribly challenging.  All of the bosses drop some form of loot that is decent (minus a couple exceptions).  At level 60 (arguably level 58), this all changes.

Instances no longer reward decent loot for the first few bosses, unless you have no accessories.  But even then, one instance run and you'll probably have all you need.  The decent gear is always reserved for the final boss.  And in terms of rewarding development and skill, this is not good.  

As I've grouped with many people outside of my static, I have seen both good players and bad players.  The bad players aren't always bad because they chose not to learn their class or things like that.  Sometimes it is just because they don't have a gaming background and are still learning the ropes.  

For these players, it kinda sucks.  You can't get to the end of an instance without greatly increasing your skill, and you can't get loot without getting to the end, unless you want to farm your arse off and just buy it off the AH.

Then if you try to use the dungeon finder, you get insta booted for not having a high enough item level, despite the dungeon finder saying you should be fine.  So grats, you wasted an hour in queue!  

My discussion or argument is that:  At least for the NM instances, loot should be spread out a bit more between the bosses.  Enigmatics should still be reserved for the final boss, but in terms if players getting better and being able to progress, it makes more sense to spread things out.  

Especially for zones like BT, where the final boss DPS check is so tight that most casuals will not be able to clear it without being carried.  

Hard modes?  Keep them as is.  It's supposed to be epic hard.",,False,self,t5_2s527,False,,sl2,True,t3_tz8ku,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/tz8ku/skill_curve_preventing_casual_players_from/,
