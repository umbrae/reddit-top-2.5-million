One woman explained they were from Texas and we all started chatting about what it was like down there and what their preconceived notions about California were. My main point is, speaking to these people I felt like I was part of their family. I felt so welcome and as if I had known them before and were just catching up like old friends. In CA, many people are so caught up with themselves, they have this better than everyone attitude and meeting these Texans just opened my eyes to what people are like elsewhere. The woman also seemed so proud to be a Texan, she showed me her drivers license and told me there's no where else like it. If Texas is like what this group of people I met were then I would like to say what a fine state you get to live in and I would love to visit there one day. 


Edit: many of you have shared amazing stories to the point where I believe I was born in the wrong state! I am so overwhelmed by such pride and how friendly the responses are.

I also plan sending a physical copy and calling his office to give my opinion on the matter.

Dear Mr. Dewhurst,

I'm writing to you regarding the vote on SB5 that occurred last night.  I find it extremely disturbing that you attempted to violate state law by trying to pass a vote after the deadline for the special session ended at midnight.  Not only that but you then changed the time of the vote in the computer system to the previous day which is completely reprehensible.

You later went on to call the crowd that had assembled ""an unruly mob"".  Mr. Dewhurst, that unruly mob was Texans voicing their opposition to your attempt to take away women's rights and you should keep in mind, sir, that you work for us, the people of Texas.  If you aren't interested in serving us and listening to our needs, then perhaps it's time for you to step down.

Use this link http://hutchison.senate.gov/?p=email_kay to email her.

""Dear Friend:
     Thank you for contacting me regarding S. 968, the PROTECT IP Act.  I welcome your thoughts and comments.

Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the PROTECT IP Act on May 12, 2011.  The legislation is in response to concerns about online copyright infringement and sale of counterfeit goods.  The bill would allow the Justice Department to seek federal court injunctions to halt online promotion of illegal activities. 

I believe copyright protection is a foundation for innovation.  Intellectual property is the creative core of the information age.  Patent and intellectual property ownership laws offer needed protection for the economic and other interests of inventors, entrepreneurs, performers, and other creative thinkers.  These protections are also important to future growth and employment in important U.S. industries. 

Protecting intellectual property is more challenging than ever before.  Among other things, high speed broadband enables access to the entire catalog of movies, music, books, television, and technology. 

Online promotion of counterfeit goods by foreign entities is also a growing concern.  How to protect copyright, patent, and intellectual property rights — and do so without infringing on consumers’ legitimate interests — requires dealing with a complex series of problems. 

The PROTECT IP Act has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Although I am not a member of that committee, please be assured that I will keep your views in mind should this bill or related legislation be reported for action by the full Senate.

I appreciate hearing from you, and I hope that you will not hesitate to contact me on any issue that is important to you.
 
Sincerely,
Kay Bailey Hutchison
United States Senator

Even one day later, it took 30 minutes and 14 gallons of water.",127,25,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/18skgk/dear_garner_state_park_patron_in_campsite_105/,"Dear Garner State Park Patron in Campsite #105:  Just wanted to let you know that I put out the fire you left burning in the fire pit *from the day before*.  Even one day later, it took 14 gallons of water.   
  
At about five in the afternoon at the end of my hike, I noticed smoke swirling from the fire pit in the campsite you abandoned earlier in the weekend.  I knew it had been some time since you left, since I had passed by that area at the beginning of my hike earlier in the day.  Looking into the pit, it was a mixture of white ash, black charcoal, unburned wood and a few orange embers.  Still blistering hot so many hours later, and enough fuel inside the pit to keep it going for at least another day.  After each gallon of water I dumped into the pit, it would roar loudly, throw up a greyish-white explosion of smoke as the water flash-boiled into steam almost immediately.  The water that was not immediately burned off was left in a furiously bubbling cauldron, fueled by several volcanic hot-pot fumaroles that just kept going, boiling away.    
  
I continued to pour gallon upon gallon into the pit, turning it into a seething mass of ugly grey mud and blackened pieces of wood.  Two gallons, three gallons, four gallons, five gallons.  Even though the fire pit was less than two feet across, there were still untouched dry hot-spots that exploded in an ashen cloud when I returned with the next deluge.  Six gallons, seven, eight, nine, ten.  Nope, still some embers in the unburned pieces of wood, several spots bubbling furiously from the untapped heat underneath.  Eleven gallons, twelve gallons, thirteen gallons.  Finally after the fourteenth gallon, stirring the muck around with a stick to be absolutely sure, the fire was dead.  
  
Garner State Park Patron #105, I thought I should inform you that the park is now safe.  It was late afternoon, and a dry cold front had just started blowing through with gusts up to 25 miles per hour.  As I was putting out the fire, dry leaves kept blowing past me and the fire pit into the piles of dry underbrush and trees at the base of the hillside starting about *six feet away*.  Even though the region is currently in a severe drought and there have been several red flag warnings for fire danger recently, I just wanted to let you know, Park Patron #105, that you do not have to worry about the gusting winds blowing embers from the fire you left burning into the rest of the park.  
  
Perhaps you were too busy when you left, Park Patron #105, to put out the fire.  After all, it was a holiday weekend and I'm sure it was quite hectic.  But when I visited earlier today on Monday, the park was all-but deserted, perhaps only a few dozen people visiting throughout the day.  And most of those were undoubtedly down by the river, instead of the more distant non-river campsites where you were located.  In fact, in the half hour it took me to put out the fire, exactly *one* truck drove past the area.  If a small leaf had blown into the fire ring, started smoldering, then another gust of wind picked it up into the crackling-dry trees less than ten feet away, it might have been some time before someone noticed the out-of-control wildfire.  
  
In 2011, nearly **four million acres** of Texas were burned in wildfires.  Park Patron #105, I hope that in the future you practice good fire safety techniques, such as NEVER LEAVE A FIRE UNATTENDED, and always put out a fire dead-cold-to-the-touch, stirring the water into the ashes to make sure there are no hot-spots.   If you ever have any questions about fire safety, Smokey Bear has some good tips: http://www.smokeybear.com/put-out-campfire.asp
   
Park Patron #105, this time I was lucky enough to put our your fire.  But next time, I hope you take the time to do it yourself.  Otherwise, there might not be a park for you to return to.",,False,self,t5_2qho4,False,,,True,t3_18skgk,http://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/18skgk/dear_garner_state_park_patron_in_campsite_105/,

He's in the 21st congressional district so you would need to either live there or be willing to move (I'm not sure if you have to be in the district when you file), so I assume this is most applicable to San Antonio redditors. I have absolutely no idea if getting the requisite signatures would be possible or if there's anyone willing to do this, but I figure this needs to be at least evaluated.

Comparisons:

**Category:** 

Sandy = 1

Galveston = 4

**Wind Speeds**: 

Sandy = Gusts of 94 mph

Galveston = 145 mph (sustained for over a minute straight)


**Storm Surge Size:**

Sandy = 13 ft

Galveston = 15 ft

**Estimated Damage Costs:**

Sandy: $20 Billion

Galveston: $99.4 Billion (adjusted for wealth normalization) 


**Warning Period for Evacuation:**

Sandy: A couple of weeks

Galveston: The morning of... 

**Death Toll:** 

Sandy (as of now) = 33-35

Galveston = 6,000 - 12,000



**This is just haunting:** The dead bodies were so numerous that burying them all was impossible. The dead were initially weighted down and dumped at sea, but when the gulf currents washed many of the bodies back onto the beach, a new solution was needed. Funeral pyres were set up wherever the dead were found and burned for weeks after the storm. The authorities passed out free whiskey to sustain the distraught men conscripted for the gruesome work of collecting and burning the dead. More people were killed in this single storm than the total of those killed in all the tropical cyclones that have struck the United States since. This count is greater than 300 cyclones, as of 2009. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 remains the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history.

I only had that movie, Godzilla and Dr Dolittle, those were the 3 VHS cassettes I rented right before the bombing started so I just watched them over and over again for 3 months.

Anyway, back to the point, I really love the US. I honestly believe that the world is a better place with a strong US in it. You guys do fuck up and disappoint a liberty loving citizen of the world like me from time to time (Guantanamo Bay, NSA etc...) but you are still a shining beacon of Liberty in this world, I honestly believe that.

Anyway, reading about the US I got to love two states a bit more than the rest, Texas and New Hampshire. I love both for a bunch of different reasons (in Texas case, among other things it's rich history, defiance, proudness, independent spirit) but what they have in common and what's a reoccurring motif in my love of that country of yours is, once more, liberty. Being  from an ex communist, extremely socialist country  and reading about places like Texas and New Hampshire where you are able to decide for yourself what's best for you, where you are able to defend yourself and your loved ones instead of being forced to depend on the Government to defend you etc etc etc....Well I'm sad that I don't live there (yet!) but I'm happy that places like that exist. 

What I would like from you is to recommend me a couple of books that would bring me closer to Texas than a wiki page can. They can be historical fiction or non fiction. 

I've read The Son by Phillip Meyer recently and loved it so I recommend that to anyone here that hasn't read it.

At all. I recently moved to San Antonio from New Hampshire to be closer to my family, which, by the way, includes quite a few Mexican-Americans. 

I have a 3-year-old daughter who is white with gray eyes and blond hair. Recently, my wife told me coworkers of hers, including Mexican-American women, warned her after meeting our daughter that blond-haired/blue-eyed white girls get picked on by the girls of Mexican descent. 

Is this true? If so, why is it true? My wife didn't want to push the issue with her coworkers at the risk of offending them, but I'm worried for my daughter, who will be entering into pre-K next year. I doubt it's a problem with 4-year-olds, but I don't want her to grow up being bullied, either.

I have no problem with Mexican-Americans or Mexicans in general. In fact, one of the things I love about San Antonio is the Mexican culture, art, and food. 

Another thing that I've noticed is my daughter, being very outgoing and friendly, tends to walk onto playgrounds waving, smiling, and shouting things like, ""Hi, friends! My name is _______! Want to play?"" and the looks she gets from some of the kids are like... I don't know... mean. Like, ""Who is the kid? Why is she saying hi to me? Why is she calling me a friend?"" This got her instant playmates in NH. Here, it gets her dirty looks. Cultural thing? Again, this is the Latino/Latina children. The white, black, and Asian kids have been pretty warm to her.

Sorry if this is a TL;DR, but I don't know how to shorten it and I'm very curious.

**EDIT**: I'd be especially interested in hearing from Mexicans, especially those who grew up in San Antonio.

For those downvoting, I don't get you. This is an honest question out of concern for my daughter. It's not an attack on anybody.",,False,self,t5_2qho4,1353881012.0,,,True,t3_13rwi8,http://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/13rwi8/raciallycharged_question_do_mexicanamerican/,

What can we do about this negligent dangerous man?
I'm waiting on a call back from the local fire Marshall.

Did say we could file on him civilally. I guess a lawyer does that? 

Update; fire Marshall just came out to my house and spoke with me. He saw that it left this guys property and came onto mine.

1326495212.0,43,self.texas,og2i1,Debrief on meeting with Sen. Cornyn on SOPA,51,8,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/og2i1/debrief_on_meeting_with_sen_cornyn_on_sopa/,"I attended a private constituent meeting with the staff of Sen. John Cornyn about SOPA/PIPA.

In attendance were individuals representing Baylor University, Electronic Frontier Foundation of Austin, Data Foundry, and others.

The Baylor representative voiced his concerns about how SOPA plays with DMCA. For instance, if a student uploaded an album to Bearspace (online storage for students) and someone claimed copyright infringement, then outside of the US the whole Baylor edu could be banned.

Another individual (if you're reading this - sorry, I didn't catch who you were!) brought up an example of Reddit: if the day after SOPA were to pass, someone on Reddit posted instructions on circumvention, would Reddit then be infringing?

I missed a lot of the constituent opinions (showed up late, oops), but here is what Cornyn's office had to say.

They're looking at the [OPEN Act](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/12/27/the-open-act-is-flawed-but-still-better-than-sopa/) which they said is better than SOPA in their eyes, but still not perfect. They think that PIPA still leaves lots to be desired.

The office is very concerned with piracy. Cornyn is also very aware of the DNS provisions in PIPA. He's been trying to address concerns about cybersecurity and DNS-SEC. Also concerned about other aspects of the bill and how they affect free speech, business regulations, and how these infringements would be litigated. 

Many of these concerns have been expressed to Senator Reid in a letter that Cornyn and several other senators wrote this morning. In the letter, also said that the process is moving too fast and asked that the cloture vote get moved so that there's more time to review the proposed bills. They said, ""We couldn't even tell you what this bill is going to look like on Tuesday. It could be completely different.""

At this point, they're still not even sure what's in the current versions of the bills because they're changing so much. They are in the process of determining the impact of legislation on Texas residents and businesses.

Then there was one last question: ""Outside of movie studios and ISPs who is in favor of this?""
They said that because constituent meetings are private, they can't share who has expressed their support of SOPA, but they did confirm that they have had statements of support in private.

I then asked, ""I certainly am ok with being known to NOT support SOPA publicly. Are you telling us that you don't have any constituents who have publicly stated their support?"" Received a similar answer to above.

Lastly, I asked if Cornyn plans to do more meetings like this, since by his staff's own admission the bill is still very much in flux.

They said that while they don't have any additional public meetings / roundtables scheduled, the best thing to do is write letters, call into the office, and arrange meetings with the Senator's staff. According to staff, Cornyn himself monitors his Facebook and Twitter accounts as well.
SO DON'T STOP PUTTING THE PRESSURE ON!

1372318947.0,45,self.texas,1h5zzd,I've seen a lot of confusion as to why the anti-choice bill SB5 is harmful to women so I broke down the omnibus bill explaining why,71,26,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/1h5zzd/ive_seen_a_lot_of_confusion_as_to_why_the/,"The bill (SB5) was an omnibus bill that was 4 bills rolled into one. They would:

1. Mandate all doctors that preform abortions have hospital admittance privileges within 30 miles of the procedure

2. Implement ""minimum standards"" for all abortions clinics, even the ones that don't preform surgical abortions and just give prescriptions for the abortion pill under 9 weeks of pregnancy.

3. Set new (outdated) requirements for the abortion pill

4. Ban abortions after 20 weeks with only a slim SLIM exception for specific fatal fetal anomalies.

These bills would do the following things:

1. Make it harder for physicians to be able to provide abortions legally. Hospital admittance privileges are hard to get. Compile that with the fact that most hospitals aren't willing to undergo the negative attention it would draw for giving privileges to abortion providers and you would create a shortage of doctors in the field. Most hospitals, whether sympathetic or not, wouldn't be willing to subject itself, employees, or patients to the almost certain pickets and protests from pro-life groups that would result.

2. It would mandate that all abortion clinics, even women's health clinics that don't provide surgical abortions but have the abortion pill, become ambulatory surgical centers. This would cost around $1.5 million or more for each clinic to upgrade and would increase their monthly costs something like $40,000+ a month. This is why all but the already 5 abortion centers that are already surgical centers would close. They would not be able to afford the upgrades. Beyond that if any clinic could afford the upgrades the estimated increase of cost of abortions in those clinics would be about 3 fold. The current cost of the average abortion here is about $420 and it would go up to about $1200 making it totally unaffordable to poor and lower class women.

3. It would require doctors administering the abortion pill to do so as set by FDA standards which is about 20 years outdated and includes doses that are three times higher than what doctors actually provide for their patients. This would also (combined with a previous ultrasound and 24 hr mandatory waiting period) force women who seek the abortion drug to make 4 separate visits to the doctor. This of course combined with the closings of the clinics would make abortions almost impossible to get for rural women in south, west, or north Texas. A number of Texas women will have to travel 600+ miles to the closest clinic and will either be forced to stay in that city for each visit (one of which is 14 days after the procedure) or she'll be forced to drive over 1,000 miles for the abortion. The cost of these trips combined with the new increases in abortion would make it unfordable for the average Texas woman. Beyond that there is a provision in this section that says women who seek abortions because of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy aren't really having ""abortions"" and are therefore exempt from the new ""safety standards"". Now why in the hell would they exempt the women who need the procedure the most from the new ""safety standards"" if they were worried about safety?

4. This part of the bill I find personally disturbing as I am prepared to start having children with my husband this year. Only 1.5% of abortions take place after 20 weeks and many are done on wanted pregnancies. Most women do not find out something is wrong with the fetus or pregnancy until the 18-20 week fetal scans. The fetus isn't large enough to detect structural problems before then. There is only a slim exception for anomalies that says ""in a physician's reasonable medical judgment, will result in the death of the infant not later than minutes to hours after birth"" It is absurd to expect doctors to predict the survivability down to the minutes or hours of babies with extreme fetal anomalies. Beyond that it has no exception for amniotic fluid drainage and all but specifically does not cover cases when women are diagnosed with things like cancer and need treatment. It also has no exception for the mental health of the mother which becomes an issue with mentally unstable or handicapped women. This part of the bill would force women to carry unhealthy pregnancies to term. It would also force unhealthy women to carry pregnancies to term that threaten their well being.

So, as you can see this bill will shut down all but 5 of the abortion clinics in the state, force women to drive possibly over 1,000 miles to the nearest clinic, increase the cost of abortions, and yes will also ban abortions after 20 weeks, even for women in terrible situations.

Aside from all of that the Texas Hospital Association announced that the wording in the medical abortion section would prevent their ability to provide prenatal care to women miscarrying. All of the medical associations in the state have publicly denounced and condemned these bills and asked the state not to pass them. These bills are dangerous and will not only hurt women seeking abortions but will hurt pregnant women who aren't as well. 

Edit: I've been eating, breathing, and living these bills for months now. If anyone has any questions regarding them I'd be more than happy to answer them to the best of my ability. If I can't answer your questions I'll pass it along to those more knowledge able than I and I'll get an answer to you as soon as possible.

About a week ago the company implemented a company wide change that now charges *YOU* the customer just for paying your bill!
Whether you make the payment over the phone w/CS, the automated service (IVR), through the Just Energy website, the collections department, even at a payment center. You will no matter what get charged $4.95!!!


Before certain contracts only allow you to pay via a certain method, if you do not pay it in that method there will be a charge. For example, if you make a payment over the phone w/a rep and your contract calls for you to always make your payment online there is a $4.95 contract payment charge.


Also, if you paid via customer service reps they had a $4.95 charge to make a payment with them but, they never advised customers that it was free with the collections department. Most customers were not even aware that our department existed, we're pretty much the people that call when you have a past due bill, disconnect notice, inactive account w/a balance still on it.


A lot of customers still do not know that they are now getting charged to make payments anywhere and will all be basically surprised (and giving us angry calls) once they realize that every single month of the year they will pretty much be paying $4.95 just because they paid their bill... basically $59.40 a year which may not seem like much but, for low income folks, elderly dependant on SSI, unemployed people that is a *lot* of money. We are not required to advise customers of this recent change and we were pretty much told by our supervisors to not advise of this charge as there is no way ""to avoid the charge anyways"".


I didn't really know where to put this but, I wanted to bring some awareness to this absolute scam and perhaps bring to light some little secrets within the company to help you guys out as well. At least as much as I can as I don't know ever departments tricks.


So in an informal way, AMA?


TL;DR - read it, it will benefit you if you're a customer. If you're not a customer it will help you stay the hell away from this company.",,False,self,t5_2qho4,1365458484.0,,,True,t3_1bvkce,http://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/1bvkce/just_energy_tx_users_or_texans_in_general_why_is/,
