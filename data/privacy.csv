But if you used Tormail and Tor BB over the last few days, congratulations the FBI deanonymized you.  So, I think that needs to sink in for a while.  Anyone thinking they could load up Tor BB, sign up on Tormail, and remain anonymous now knows this isn't the case if the server is malicious or otherwise compromised.

What do we do?  For a long time we've been recommending the use of Tor BB in the sidebar.  It is certainly one of the better ways to remain anonymous on the internet but this episode with Freedom Hosting makes it clear that just Tor is not enough.  I'd like to start a discussion of best practices when it comes to using the internet anonymously.

If we can come to a general agreement I'd like to add that to the FAQ and redirect the Tor BB link in the sidebar to that discussion on the Wiki.  I know there are people here who have forgotten more about networking and crypto than I'll ever learn.  What I'm shooting for is the next level of anonymity that is also still attainable by most reasonably computer savvy people.

I'm going to make this a sticky for a while because this discussion will, I hope, lead to a change of the sidebar/FAQ of the subreddit.  I also think we need to think more about hardening our anonymity armor even as the government steps up its game to penetrate that armor.

Thanks

The PRISM project and other illegal data gathering done by the US government is a realistic threat. With the majority of the major technology providers for computers and smart phones most likely being part of the program I consider everything that I have so far done on a computer to be compromised. 

My phone is a Nokia Lumia, I have the find my phone feature activated. The NSA most likely have a record of my movements from the time I own this phone. They know from this where I live and work.

I use facebook and have up-to-date information on there. The NSA have recent photographs of me, know who my family &amp; friends are, know what I like and don't like. Not to mention what they can gain from data mining my comments.

I use google analytics for my website, my browser is chrome and I use gmail as a ""spam e-mail"" for registering online services. Thankfully my primary e-mails are hosted on my own host in Europe, which is probably not directly monitored by the NSA.

I've got a mac computer, god knows what it sends back to apple and again forward to the NSA.

---

I've thought of buying a separate computer and install debian on it to use for every day internet surfing and use where I do not have to identify as myself. I'd keep my mac, and use it for internet services where I have to identify myself (facebook, email, work et. al.). I'd think thrice before doing anything on my mac. I'd stop putting photographs up on facebook, I'd stop e-mailing anything that I would consider private.

The linux computer I'd use for everything else. Maybe use a VPN service as well? 

What would be best practices in creating a computer and environment where I do not have to worry too much about being  snooped on? ",,False,,t5_2qhlc,False,,,True,t3_1k140v,http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1k140v/lavabit_shutdown_made_me_reconsider_how_i_use_the/,

He also said he wouldn't sign the NDAA. They made slight edits to it--but, notably, *did not* fix the section he said was unconstitutional--before he signed it anyways.

Yes, of course, I realize it was a military budget and he can't line item veto. But when you have a President who will sign something after declaring it unconstitutional and threatening to veto, his threatening to veto something else loses some credibility.

Also, IIRC, he's only used the veto twice since he took office in 2009.
 
The Senate is our last real line of defense on CISPA. I'd encourage everyone to contact their senators, and to urge everyone they know to do the same. Pro-CISPA lobbyists are pumping a ton of money into this and they have the ears of our senators.

This is then packaged up into addons for Firefox, Chrome and Greasemonkey so that they are shown as if they were never deleted.

The effect is that when you browse a thread instead of [deleted] you see the original unedited post.  It appears to be widespread enough now that security by obscurity isn't going to work.  The site is unedditreddit.com and apparently they restarted their operation about a month ago.  They had closed it down two years ago after Raldi threatened to ban their scraping activity.

I'm troubled by this because as a mod I really do need the ability to delete posts sometimes and if some website simply backfills it that is a problem.  Of course this suggests that you be even more careful about what you post and try to make sure nothing can be linked to your personal identity.  Also, if you (or a mod) delete something you must assume it is still available as this website appears to be scraping posts in real time.

I'll probably complain to the admins when I have time later today but feel free to beat me to the punch (they are probably sick of my complaints by now).  I don't think reddit needs to necessarily make it *easy* for sites to scrape and save and serve deleted comments.

**Edit:** What appears to be happening is that the addons send the data directly from the browser to unedditreddit.  So there is really nothing reddit can do about it.  Though some people seem to be sending the feed garbage data in an attempt to corrupt it.

**Edit 2:** Details.  When you install the addon it uses a POST to send the entire thread you're reading to the unedditreddit site where they store it.  When the client side javascript comes across a [deleted] comment it sends a GET to the unedditreddit server to see if someone uploaded the comment before it was deleted. If it finds it it inserts that into your page so you see the deleted comment.  In short, this can't, I don't think, be stopped.  Since users are sending the pages to unedditreddit there isn't a way to stop it on the reddit site.  however, as people have noted they are accepting POST data so anyone can send anything (particularly if the comments are numbered sequentially it would be easy to get ahead of them and POST garbage to their database).",,False,,t5_2qhlc,1361683197.0,,,True,t3_1930g3,http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1930g3/psa_your_deleted_comments_arent_actually_deleted/,moderator

1370628777.0,221,self.privacy,1fvko6,Yesterday we learned about NSA's PRISM. Here's a guide to using free software to take back some of your privacy today.,268,47,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1fvko6/yesterday_we_learned_about_nsas_prism_heres_a/,"**Chat:** 

Anything that supports OTR (Off-The-Record messaging) is secure and desirable. It's a plugin that encrypts your chat, ensuring that only you and your friend can see the contents of the messages. Anyone listening in would have to spend hundreds of thousands of computer hours decrypting even a single message.

* Use Adium on OS X and Pidgin with OTR on Windows or Linux.

* Use Gibberbot on Andorid (Free) or ChatSecure on iOS (price?). These both support OTR.

Do not chat on Facebook.com or with Google Talk in Gmail.com/Google+/Google Hangouts.

 * These services log your communication, provide it to third parties, and do not support encryption. You and your Facebook friends can still chat on that account with OTR if you both use Pidgin/Adium or another client.

Do not use text messages, Skype, or iChat.

 * Your data is shared with third parties and they don't support encryption. Microsft actually removed Skype's secure architecture on purpose so they could surveil their users.

Switching to encrypted chat is one of the easiest and most effective ways to take back some of your privacy.

**Storing Files:**

Whenever you want to store anything sensitive, use TrueCrypt and create either an encrypted USB drive or an encrypted file container. 

* You'll have to enter a secure password to open the drive or container, and you'll then be able to store files to it securely. When you close the container it'll encrypt your files.

Use OwnCloud or SpiderOak to store files in the cloud. 

* Both of these support encryption and ensure that only you and the people you choose can access your files.

Do not use Google Drive, iCloud, or DropBox to store any personally identifiable information (or preferably anything). 

* Cloud services store your files in a way that allows them to read their contents, and they will provide your files to any law enforcement agency. Like other popular services, these products were explicitly mentioned as having backdoors that allow for easy surveillance.

Consider using a system that supports Full Disk Encryption. This will ensure that as soon as you turn your computer off all of your files are secure. You'll have to enter a secure password when you turn your computer on.

 * Ubuntu (Linux), OS X, and Windows all support FDE, and there are many guides online. You'll most likely have to reinstall your operating system to switch over.

**Phones:**

Your smartphone reports your location to your telephone company and the company that sold you the phone at all times.

 * Your location is obtained via GPS, WiFi SSID reporting, cell phone tower triangulation, and your IP address. (The upshot being that if your phone connects to anything, it's capable of determining your location.)

If your phone backs up your personal settings to Apple or Google (such as WiFi password, your contacts, etc.), those companies can access it and will provide it to third parties if legally required to do so.

Check the permissions of the apps you install. Any app that needs access to phone permissions is probably sending your contact list to its creators. This information is highly valuable.

There is no secure smartphone. 

There's no smartphone that does not expose personally identifiable information about you. 

There's currently no way to use a smartphone in a way that's even remotely as secure as a computer. 

* A WiFi-only device running a build of the Android Open Source Project is as close as you can get. Even then the privacy tools aren't as good as on a desktop, and mobile apps are desgned from the ground up to obtain usage analytics. It's just considered normal on mobile platforms.

Even if you have a lock screen, law enforcement can plug in a device that dumps the contents of your phone's storage and memory, bypassing this security.

 * It's also speculated that iOS's device-level encryption has a backdoor for law enforcement. Their solution is closed-source and thus cannot be vetted by security professionals.

 * It's unclear whether Android also supports this.

**Browsing:**

Use Firefox or Chromium for all web browsing

 * Both of these browsers are open source and have been vetted for security and privacy

 * Firefox has robust privacy addons that tend to superior to Chrome's/Chromiums' (in my opinion). I find Ghostery, NoScript, and AdBlock Plus superior on Firefox, and it supports addons like Convergence and Google Sharing. Its syncing options also allow you to do client-side encryption and to use your own server.

 * Firefox is also not made by a company whose business is built around obtaining your personal information.

Do not use Google Chrome. 

 * It's closed-source and thus it cannot be vetted by programmers and public security researchers.

 * Google's Privacy Policy grants them permission to monitor all information you enter into Chrome.

 * The Google Instant bar searches Google as you type. Which means that if you type Facebook.com it will search Google for every letter, revealing what sites you visit to Google.

 * Choosing to sync your Chrome settings will send your browsing history, bookmarks, cookies, and other settings to Google.

 * It has many additional features that send your personal information to Google, such as text fields that send your data to Google to get spelling suggestions.

Use the Tor Browser Bundle for anything sensitive.

 * Tor is an anonymity network as well as a ""deep web."" You can either obscure the location and identity of your computer, or connect to websites that are inaccessible to the Internet at large, and only to people using Tor. This is extremely secure.

 * Using Tor doesn't mean you're always safe to post personally identifiable information, or that your connection to public Internet sites (not on the darknet) is encrypted from the exit node to the site.

* If possible, do not use Facebook. There is absolutely zero information on Facebook that is not actively shared with Facebook and dragnet surveillance efforts.

* If possible, do not use Google+. It suffers from the same insecure design as Facebook, except Google is even more plugged into your personal life.

Other popular deepweb projects are I2P and Freenet. They're used for free speech activities, and I2P also operates exit nodes as an anonymizing proxy.

For extremely sensitive browsing, burn a live CD or a live USB key of Ubuntu or another Linux distribution. This ensures that none of your personal data will be saved to the drive, and your machine will be secured as soon as you turn it off.

**Email:**

There are no secure web-based email providers.

 * All of your emails are stored in a way where it can be easily accessed. 

 * The legal requirements for reading old email are far more lax than the requirements for reading recent email.

 * There have been legal rulings stating that because your email is on a remote server, it is not your personal information.

To my knowledge, the only slightly realistic way to secure email is to use GPG.

 * You can use a plugin like FireGPG in Firefox. You and your contacts will have to generate key pairs and exchange public keys. The process is not nearly as simple as OTR.

 * No web provider makes it easy to do this. Changes in the web interfaces will break your GPG plugin. The only really good way to do this is to stop using the web interface at all, and use a standalone email client like Thunderbird or Evolution.

 * It's not in any free email provider's best interest to make your email secure.

Basically, do not send sensitive emails. Do not assume you can ever delete an email.

I am not part of a revolutionary activist group, I am not sending embarrassing love letters, nor am I selling illegal drugs. I am young, my record is clean, and my email consists mainly of university newsletters, and the circulation of humorous links among friends. My life is normal, uneventful, and on the straightest of straight edges. But yet, I feel that I have something to fear.


   I am fine with having my personal information read by a government agent. They would find little more than receipts for electronics and videos of cats. What I fear, however, is the information and communication of someone being analyzed who has something legitimate to hide, whether it be an activist in the US or China, or a homosexual in Russia or Iran. Private communication without the fear of government surveillance is an important part of almost all social change. 


   Because of this, I support encryption and the right to privacy, and am willing to pay for services such as Lavabit or VPNs which protect that right. As a long time Lavabit user its closure, as well as the grim state of affairs which caused it, hit me quite hard. I did not pay for Lavabit to send covert messages of LOLcats. I payed for Lavabit to promote the continuation of the service, so that people like Edward Snowden could use it. 


   This is the important part of all this. If you're not paying for something, then you're what's being paid for. Whether you feel that your own privacy is important or not, realize its importance to society as a whole. Also realize that we have to support private services to help them continue operating. If we don't donate to projects like Autistici, or pay for services like Countermail, then all that we will be left with will be Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo. 


  I have something to fear, and that's the day that real private communication is no more because people didn't want to spend the equivalent of a sandwich a month on services like Lavabit or Private Internet Access. I fear the day that a gay teen in Russia is harassed by police after they read his emails to a lover. I fear the day that a curious mind in the US can't look up and discuss Marx or Trotsky without being flagged and put on a watch-list. I fear the day that people will be scared to discuss ideas for fear of government surveillance and discipline.


   I may have nothing to hide, but I'm here to support those who do.

------------

According to security expert Steve Gibson and court testimony by an AT&amp;T technician from 2006, the NSA gets major tech companies' data without their permission or knowledge by forking off fiber optic light signals (as a prism would) just upstream of where all of the tech companies named in leaked documents purchase their bandwidth. The technician talks about the installation of a secret room by the NSA in AT&amp;T's San Francisco facility at 611 Folsom Street, San Francisco. 

As Gibson points out, this allows the NSA to snoop on nearly all data going into major tech companies without actually connecting to their servers, and likely without their knowledge.",,False,,t5_2qhlc,False,,,True,t3_1gb0pa,http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1gb0pa/how_prism_actually_works_1520_att_fiber_optic/,

Hushmail should **not** be considered an alternative.

To quote from an article in The Register:

&gt;Hushmail has updated its terms of service to clarify that encrypted emails sent through the service can still be turned over to law enforcement officials, providing they obtain a court order in Canada.

&gt;September court documents (pdf) from a US federal prosecution of alleged steroid dealers reveals that Hush Communications turned over 12 CDs involving emails on three targeted Hushmail accounts, in compliance of court orders made through the mutual assistance treaty between the US and Canada. Hushmail is widely used by privacy advocates and the security-conscious to send confidential emails.

&gt;Hush Communications, the firm behind Hushmail, previously claimed ""not even a Hushmail employee with access to our servers can read your encrypted email"".

&gt;However an updated explanation states that it is obliged to do everything in its power to comply with court orders against specified, targeted accounts. Unlocking targeted accounts involves sending a rogue Java applet to targeted users that captures a user's passphrase and sends it back to Hush Communications. This information, when passed onto law enforcement officials, allows access to stored emails and subsequent correspondence sent through the service.

&gt;The possibility that law enforcement officials can tap targeted accounts exists whether or not Hushmail users use the supposedly more secure Java applet option or a simpler web server encryption set-up. The updated terms of service explain:

&gt;""Hushmail is a web-based service, the software that performs the encryption either resides on or is delivered by our servers. That means that there is no guarantee that we will not be compelled, under a court order issued by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada, to treat a user named in a court order differently, and compromise that user's privacy.""

1366603144.0,183,self.privacy,1cudy0,This subreddit is closed to new links for 24 hours in protest of CISPA,220,37,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1cudy0/this_subreddit_is_closed_to_new_links_for_24/,"**To everyone who subscribes to or reads r/privacy,**

Starting at 12am EST this subreddit is going into moderated mode.  This post will be the last post for the next 24 hours.  Why?

I'm doing this in the hopes of helping to incite a popular protest against the bill known as CISPA.  Normally I try to maintain a light touch in this subreddit.  I trust and respect the subscribers and I think you have good judgement.  In only rare cases will I do something like this and I'm only doing it because if CISPA passes it is irreversible.

I have read the bill twice, in full.  IANAL but I believe I understand the basics of what they're trying to do here.  Firstly they want to set up a protected class of corporations called ""cybersecurity providers"" and second they want to open up a legal pipeline from corporate databases to the government.  Now, we should be aware that there are some protections for privacy written into the bill but that is a fig leaf to cover up parts one and two.  Once this data exchange is set up it will be trivial to slowly amend the law over time to erode privacy or for the Justice Department to simply come up with ""creative interpretations"" of the language in the bill.  The US government has already shown that it cannot be trusted with this much ability to intrude on the privacy of US citizens.

So we only get one shot at this.  If they pass it and Obama ""reluctantly"" signs it then we have lost a major front on the battle for privacy.  Opposing this type of bill is one of the main reasons this subreddit exists.  So while I'm sorry for hijacking it I feel it is necessary.

**What can you do:**

1. [Read the bill passed by the House](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr624/text). Never trust anyone to interpret these things for you.

1. [Write your Senator](https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=9048).  The EFF makes this pretty easy.

1. Talk about this in other subreddits.  Link to this thread if you like.

Beyond that suggestions would be most helpful so please comment below.

Thanks, and I hope we can beat this thing.

There are talks to introduce network level filters and blocking that block any and all adult content from being accessed, unless you contact your ISP and opt out of the blocking.

This is supposedly to 'protect children', but I firmly believe that's what the parents should be doing. Teaching their kids about sex as soon as they hear about it, and teaching their kids that porn isn't real, it's just the sexual equivalent of an action film (or whatever analogy they deem appropriate). Taking control of that is, in my opinion, fascism, and I feel that any kind of censorship of the internet is a terrible idea, so let's hit the nail on the head and sign the petition!

In other words, the NSA conducts signals intelligence with the aim of helping US businesses and exports.

USPTO claims that businesses making heavy use of intellectual property in one way or another make up 34.8% of US GDP.

The US has been pushing ACTA, TPP, the upcoming Beijing Treaty, and other copyright extending and expanding treaties. There is heavy lobbying via industry groups like the BSA with express backing from the US government.

Google, Microsoft, Skype, and others have been claiming that they always check whether some NSA request is lawful or not, before releasing any data. We know from Snowden's revelations that all requests are covered by a blanket FISA Court authorization -- individual foreigners are not considered by that court. It would be absurd to even consider the notion that a company (e.g. Microsoft) is sent a surveillance file on a potential terrorist and Microsoft's lawyers evaluate whether to release data on the guy or not. Quite likely the decision process at Microsoft goes like this: Is this a US citizen? NO: Release data. YES: Ask for proper rubber stamp. PRISM's ""collection from servers"" could be an automated service, which takes a username, makes simple checks to see whether the username belongs to a US citizen, and if the answer is ""no"" with high certainty, automatically gives data to the NSA.

Taking these together, it would seem to me that the US surveillance scandal is directly linked to the whole global copyright reform issue. At this moment people who fight for copyright reform are enemies of the United States and as far as any of their data on US servers is concerned, they have no right to privacy. It will be scanned, analyzed, and the conclusions forwarded to US diplomats working to push expanded intellectual property law.

To defeat this and allow for true democratic debate of the issues, we need to keep the NSA scandal in the news and the way we can continue to do so is by tying one to the other. Every time the issue of copyright reform comes up, we need to remind everyone that expanding intellectual property rights is part of US foreign policy and as such, it is also backed by US foreign intelligence agencies. Activistis working to reform IP laws can expect zero privacy on the internet.

The argument ""I have nothing to hide"" loses all its power when you consider that the aim of US surveillance is not to catch criminals, but to change the laws of other countries.

As these laws are changed via international treaties, they will also alter the laws of United States itself. Here we have a massive surveillance industry helping to create and enforce global treaties, which also change US laws, and clamp down on internet freedom.

This probably isn't a specifically [/r/privacy](/r/privacy) issue but the user involved came to my attention because I moderate this subreddit.  I think it is a sad case that everyone should be able to take a look at and see how they feel about it.

First, reddit has a thing called 'ninjabanning'.  This is a practice where either manually or automatically a user is pseudo-banned.  What this means is that the user can log in, submit links, post comments, up and downvote etc.  However, what the user does *not* know is that no one else can see these actions.  It is a sort of cruel experiment wherein subjects are placed into an everlasting timeout.  The site appears to that user to be fully functional but is actually suppressing everything that person does.

I've known this existed for a while.  However, I never got to see it fully in action before.  That was until jasonp1982 came along.  [This link](https://pay.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/qaq1u/privacy_friendly_webmail_does_it_exist/) was initially in my spam queue and I had to decide whether to kick it loose or not.  I did, because it clearly isn't spam.  After that I had to manually approve every one of this user's posts.  I thought this was odd because it hadn't happened before.  What I now know is that jasonp1982 was one of the untouchables.  He had been shadowbanned *over a year ago* for a cluster of posts that probably do qualify as spam.  However, since that time his contributions have been positive and in some cases important.  His reviews of the email providers in the thread linked above were very informative.

I'd like everyone to take a look at jasonp1982's [posting history](https://imgur.com/a/0kD6B/noscript).  You'll note that after his initial posts he has no up or downvotes on his posts.  That is because no one was seeing them right up until I manually approved the post to r/privacy.  Then of course you can see his account come alive because he has a real contribution to make.  Please note I'm not nominating him for redditor of the year, I'm just suggesting that the punishment here does not suit the crime.  Further, it just made me feel really bad to see someone trying to reach out on a social website only to be summarily ignored, systematically, by reddit.  I guess it made me a little sad even though that sounds a bit sappy, there it is.  As far as I know there is no appeal process.

If you think this sucks you can do some things.

1) I'd love some discussion of ninjabanning.  Is this good, bad, indifferent?

2) If you want to upvote this as an issue you can do it in the thread I posted in [r/reportthespammers](https://pay.reddit.com/r/reportthespammers/comments/qlu88/can_i_get_a_review_of_jasonp1982/).

3) You can PM the mods and ask them to reconsider the ban of jasonp1982 and/or stop the practice of ninjabanning.",,False,,t5_2qhlc,True,,,True,t3_qmtb3,http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/qmtb3/the_dark_downside_of_reddits_ninjaban_policy/,moderator

But in that time we've not only reached the 10,000 subscriber mark but we've also grown as a community in more ways than one.

I'd like to direct you over to the FAQ to see one of our most visible accomplishments to date.  It is still evolving over time but it is a great place to learn about privacy issues.  The drill through links are like taking a short college course on privacy in the information age.  We've also been developing the eyes and ears of the internet's early warning system.  We here in /r/privacy are routinely the first group to pick up on rising privacy threats before the larger subreddits promote the stories to the front page.  For now you are providing the stories but, in time, I hope /r/privacy will take its rightful place as a default subreddit and we will help shape the course of the debate.

But I cant do this alone--I need help.  Toward that end I decided 5 months ago that if we could garner enough attention to reach 10,000 subscribers that I would form a governing council.  The job of the council would be to select action-oriented projects to advance the cause of privacy.  *Today we have reached that subscriber goal!*

Since I originally posted the idea of forming a council I've had a lot of time to think about it.  And I think it was a mistake to leave too much of the authority in my hands.  As a result I've decided to open it up to the subscribers.  I'd like volunteers or nominees to be elected to serve on the /r/privacy Governing Board.  Anyone may name nominees and that includes nominating yourself (please don't be shy) or others.  **I officially nominate Ascii_Cat, bincat, lugh, EquanimousMind and Joe_12256.**

Before anyone accepts I'd like to outline a few expectations of Council members.

1. Once you are selected for the originating council you can't ever be removed for any reason though you can resign.

1. You may be called on to do things that disclose who you are.  This could include things like setting up a 501c3 that can't be done anonymously.  If you know for certain that you will never ever want to use your real name for anything here then you may want to turn down the nomination.

1. After the formation of the originating council only a 100% unanimous vote by council members can approve a new member.

The final selection will be by consensus and will include up to 7 originating members.  I'm not assuming I'll make the cut and I hope the subscribers will support me.  I'd encourage anyone who wishes to be an originating member to make your case below.  Thanks all, and good luck :)

**Edit 1** Please note I won't be altering the above text, it will remain as originally posted.  lugh has declined nomination.  If you see other nominations that you like please second them.  Thank you.

**Edit 2** For now I've placed this on hold.  i don't think we have the critical mass needed to make this happen.  Thank you for those who expressed an interested and I hope to reach out to you again in the future.",,False,,t5_2qhlc,1348379086.0,,,True,t3_zqqfc,http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/zqqfc/when_this_subreddit_reaches_10000_subscribers_im/,moderator

I'd like to ask that we drill down on that in some more detail.  Can the average person be expected to run their own mail server?  Are there additional options for people who aren't able to put in that kind of time or effort?

There are a lot of posts asking for suggestions.  It seems like a good idea to try to roll that up into a larger thread.

Thanks

We shouldn't be putting our guard down like this anyway.  We know they're going to draft up a new bill in the next month or so and we need to be ready for it.  We need to keep spreading the word to everyone and their brother that we have to stop this bullshit.  We need to vote corrupt representatives out of office and take to the streets when they try to take our rights.

[But there's a whole other layer to all of this.](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57581161-38/u.s-gives-big-secret-push-to-internet-surveillance/)  The Obama administration is already doing everything outlined by CISPA long before it was even written up.  The only reason he said he'd veto it (which, if you read the statement, you know that this would only delay CISPA as his conditions wanted greater penalties for corporations that didn't cooperate with government surveillance) was to save face.  We can't let shit like this fly.

It is of the utmost importance that we get the word out.  We're all equipped with this knowledge now, and we have a *responsibility* to educate people.  The Founding Fathers knew that society had to remain vigilant for this government to function, but we've grown complacent.  Now's the time to stand up and do something.  Tell your friends and your family what's going on and what we have to do.  Support organizations, like the [Electonic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org), the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org), and the [American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org).  Knowledge is power; fight for your rights.

**EDIT:** I've done some reading and, while the Senate is apparently not going to vote on CISPA, they are currently drafting their own version. Said version could possibly be good for all parties, but we need to be wary and make sure the Senate isn't just trying to maximize their lobbying profits.",,False,,t5_2qhlc,1366990678.0,,,True,t3_1d5kau,http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1d5kau/two_things_1_cispa_is_not_dead_and_2_were_not/,

Its constantly present as video of WTC 7, or news about the FBI anti-occupy wallstreet unit becomes another chapter in the narritive. I ask myself every time I see the new DARPA or USAF monstrosity like robot mosquitos that inject poison or crowd controlling torture beams, and every time some judge decides cops don't need a warrant to strip-search you, or stick a bug in your car, or more recently; track your every move via your cell phone. 

Why? 

Why is our government doing this to us? We expect them by now to funnel tax dollars to billionaires while our cities fall apart. We know they'll lie to us about supporting al-queada in Syria in order to remove Assad as Iran's chief ally in the region so they can invade like they've been trying to convince us is necessary forever. And we understand that they won't rest until Julian assange is in jail for ~~publishing their dirty laundry for the world to see~~ rape.

But why here? Why are they preparing for martial law? Why are they fighting in court for the ability to lock up and torture American citizens indefinitely? Why have they built a system that dredges up enormous amounts of data on virtually every American via our facebooks, emails and phone conversations. Whats with this post war on drugs/terror legislation stolen from Orwell's nightmares? Why have they been working so hard for so long to deconstruct, reinterpret and undermine the constitution? When did we become the enemy and why? And more importantly, where and when do you think its all going to come together? These are the first laws of a brave new world, the one our children will grow up in. And so far its sort of looking like if they're not dying of heat stroke, or drowning in ice melt, they'll be locked up as a 'belligerent actor' in some pit in florida.

I didn't close the subreddit to new submissions lightly.  I truly do fear for freedom in America in a way that I never did before.  There are so few battles these days that we can actually win.  CISPA is one of them and it is going to be a very narrow margin of victory--if we get it.

So if you took some time to call or write your Senator, thank you.  If you were offended by all of this, I'm sorry.  Right over in the sidebar there it says we're trying to change minds and to do that we have to be nice.  I believe that.  i also believe we need to know where to make stands.  Where to stand and say ""this far and no further"".  I believe this is one of those times.  So I took an extraordinary action.

But Ferrari is not being accused of making fun of the Luksic, but of identity theft, a crime that carries a sentence of between 61 and 541 days in jail in Chile. And according to press reports, Ferrari would have never been identified without help from Twitter.

Although free speech and the right to parody are legally protected in Chile, press reports indicate that the key piece of information to identify Ferrari came when the Chilean prosecutors sent a request for information to the U.S. State Department, which asked Twitter to give up the IP of the computer used to post to the @losluksic account. This was not a judicial warrant for information, which is the Chilean legal standard for requesting private information, but merely a simple request for information from the prosecutors.

Also, some reports indicates that the Chilean request was labeled as “identity theft”, although this criminal offence in the US requires that the person accussed ""knowingly transfers or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, any unlawful activity..."", which leave the Chilean claim outside of any 'probable cause' standard, since in this case there is not intent nor unlawfulness of intended use.

Derechos Digitales, a Chilean organization dedicated to digital rights in Chile, is [helping to defend](http://www.derechosdigitales.org/2013/02/19/luksic-twitter/) Ferrari in court. Claudio Ruiz, Derechos Digitales' Director, told the press ""Hablamos de una cuenta que tenía un fondo de billetes cayendo y donde se vertían expresiones como ‘tenemos cualquier plata’. Era obvio para cualquier persona que Andrónico Luksic no iba a estar haciendo esos comentarios"" (""we are talking about an account that had bills falling from the sky as a cover image and that posted things like ""we have so much money"". It was obvious to anybody that Andrónico Luksic was not going to be making those comments""). ""Acá el único delito es haber parodiado a un poderoso"" (""The only offence here is to have parodied a powerful person""), Ruiz added.

Although Twitter has made news by [their willingnesss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikileaks_related_Twitter_subpoenas) to protect their users' privacy in the face of legal overreach, it looks like in this case they've given up one of their users without much of a fight, and without being legally required to do so.

I'm a firm believer that we are on the right side of history.  I believe that people both want and deserve an inalienable right to privacy.  At a minimum we expect the government to respect both the spirit and the actual words in the 4th Amendment.

We have added quite a few subscribers this week.  No doubt some people will be shocked by the revelations that came out with respect to the NSA.  However, no regular reader of /r/privacy is surprised.  Our government went off the rails after 9/11 and has yet to get back on.  Obama's defense this week of the NSA's tactics was, I believe, the low point of his Presidency.  It is sad because as a professor of constitutional law, and a man who promised to reform these bad practices, he has been a severe disappointment.

So to the newcomers I say welcome and to the people who have been around awhile I say thanks.

Together we will select one focused project that we as a subreddit can focus on.  When consensus is achieved we will develop a project plan to make it happen.

I'm determined that this community become action oriented.  If it does not become action oriented then I will have failed and should hand off the subreddit to someone else.

* Installed VPN and configured it in a way to connect to a random server each time on startup. (I'm using [PIA](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) as it's the fastest one I ever had and TF listed them as non-logging vpn service).

* Configured DNS servers with [OpenNic](http://www.opennicproject.org/). So my ISP or Google can't log my IPs.

* Installed [KeePass](http://keepass.info/) with 50+ char master password. Now I keep everything there. Unique 20+ char super strong passwords for each site.

* Installed [CyanogenMod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/) on my android devices. Also installed [DroidWall](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.googlecode.droidwall.free&amp;hl=en) and blocked every application from accessing internet except browser. (even kernel)

* Removed Chrome and installed Chromium. Unchecked everything under ""Privacy"" in settings. And checked ""Send do not track request"" there (Some site-analytics scripts respect that and do not track you). Chromium is open source, so there's no hidden tracking. It's as cool as chrome, but without tracking.

* Changed my search engine to [Startpage](https://startpage.com). And installed custom user style - [Google look for startpage](http://userstyles.org/styles/60164/startpage-google-look). Startpage uses Google's search results but doesn't track you. Add google style to it and it will feel like google, but without tracking.

* Encrypted all my files which are uploaded in cloud (Dropbox, Skydrive etc.) with [BoxCryptor](https://www.boxcryptor.com/). I'm running synctoy to sync my folders once a day which will be placed in boxcryptor folder, boxcryptor will encrypt all files individually and then upload to cloud in encrypted way. But I'm searching for replacement for boxcryptor, because it's closed-source and free version lacks support of filename encryption which is also needed. If you have any idea of this kind of software but open-source and with filename encryption - post it.

* Removed Google Analytics from all of my sites and installed [Piwik](http://piwik.org/). Hey! I respect your privacy too! Enabled hiding last part of IP and I'm respecting users with DNT requests. Piwik has that by default. And it's free and open source!

* Moved from Google Maps to [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/). It lacks few streets and numbers in my city, but hey, I started contributing after work. Just walking around and tagging streets and numbers :)

* Using different usernames on each site. I just pick up a word and brainstorm a new username for each site. This way no one can find links between my 2 accounts on different sites.

The only thing that's left is email. I found one email service - [Autistici](http://www.autistici.org/en/index.html) through prism-break which says they respect privacy. But still, I don't want to keep emails on servers. And that's the question I have to you guys, maybe we can find a solution. Here's what I want to do with emails:

1. Use server which promises they really remove emails on server after you hit delete. ([Autistici](http://www.autistici.org/en/index.html))

2. When receive/send email, download it to your computer and remove from server ([Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/))

3. Encrypt downloaded email with boxcryptor or something else ([BoxCryptor](https://www.boxcryptor.com/))

4. Sync encrypted email in cloud, so you always have emails on every device and they are always backed-up in case you damage your hard drive. And that's where I'm stuck. Problem is that I couldn't find a way to download all emails separately so I can encrypt/decrypt them separately and upload only changes. Because your email file might be over gigabytes and you can't have it synced all the time. If we can find a way to scan changed in new emails and upload only changed - that would be super cool!

Anyway, in conclusion I want to thank NSA! I became better person, supporting open-source software and mapping OSM :) And started respecting other peoples' privacy. Thank you, NSA!",,False,,t5_2qhlc,False,,,True,t3_1h11m2,http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1h11m2/almost_complete_privacy_checklist/,

I mean, they could easily still spy on you and just lie by saying they don't, providing placebos like the search history options. But has anyone ever actually looked into the question of whether or not your browsing history is secretly transmitted?

I've used Chrome for half a decade now and quite like it. Switching would be mildly annoying for me. Recently I've finally decided that it's time to take the privacy issue into my own hands. I already use Ghostery (though I'm considering dropping it thanks to threads like these [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/13sgx8/how_effective_is_ghostery_is_there_something/) [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/14t29c/whats_rprivacys_consensus_on_ghostery_we_seem_to/) [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/uql5a/ghostery_vs_adblock_plus/)) and EasyList Privacy filters, block third-party cookies, and of course do obvious stuff like have most plugins as click-to-play. But taking the final plunge and dumping the browser made by the biggest ad company in history is something I have to confirm is worthwhile, because I simply like the browser. FF has improved immensely since I switched to Chrome all those years ago, but at the end of the day I still prefer Chrome's functionality.

Both attended through work.   I network with a lot of people who work at corporate for large retail chains (who I can't name) but there's several of these stores in every town (some even have grocery stores in them (if that's enough clues).  Well, they told me that they're working on testing a system that was offered to them by a firm (who I don't have the name of) that tracks the Mac address of your smartphone.  Most people know that this is broadcast to wifi routers, even if you don't connect to them, it's just a unique identifier that's part of the wifi system that scans for wifi networks and shows you their information.  

Well this firm, who I'll try despriately to get the name of has figured out a way to tie your name to your phones mac address by using sensors installed at the close proximity of the checkout lanes at major retail stores.  Once your identity is confirmed either by register data from your credit card, or through the stores loyalty card.  It becomes part of this network that wil show all data collected on you, where you've been, your spending habits, etc.  The major key here is they don't even have to tie you to the mac address, since they can scan it when you enter, and scan it at checkout, etc.  

They've also discussed this same firm is contracting it's data to debt collectors, to find out things like where you live, or where you're staying, or where your car might be parked, and how much you're spending and not paying them.  They're saying this is public information since the data collected is data that woud be available to the retail outlets anyway, and the spending information is attached to your mac address, while your location information is tied to your identity. So they're claiming that they're only using patterns to tie together the scans, to the register data, there's no where in their system that processes both together until the retailer says, show me data for this register at this time, and also show me any location data collected at this checkpoint at this time.  It will match the two up and show you a pattern.  It's pretty messed up stuff, it's all very secretive, since any member has to sign confidentiality agreements etc.  

Can anyone confirm this or shed some more light on this?  ",,False,,t5_2qhlc,False,,,True,t3_1fx5ix,http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1fx5ix/unconfirmed_trolls_are_out_for_our_privacy_not/,

Fighting PRISM and other forms of government surveillance solely in the political arena will not suffice. Regardless of its outcome, it won't prevent future transgressions, nor will it protect people outside the United States, whether it is from the United States government, their respective governments, or any other government. Our data flows internationally, our whole online life is international, but our political response - per definition - will only be national.

If political oversight and the legislature fails you, technology becomes law.The only remaining boundary is what is technologically possible. Whether the government [taps the backbone of the internet](http://twit.tv/show/security-now/408), or has direct access to company servers, the mass surveillance has become feasible because data is highly concentrated and a lot of it is transmitted unencrypted.

The only solution to remedy this situation I can think of is a technological one. We need a way to encrypt all our conversations online, whether it is e-mail, IM, VoIP, video chat or file transfers. I am no expert, but I believe there has to be a user-friendly way that integrates with out existing devices. Maybe small servers located in our homes, that we can route our conversations and data through and that communicate with each other in a distributed network, much like Bittorrent.

A lot of technology for protecting users privacy is out there, but nobody uses it. Why, because it is perceived as being hard to use and most importantly, it lacks critical mass. What good is e-mail encryption, when nobody else uses it? That's right, the old chicken or the egg problem. 

We need someone that has the clout to push this technology into the market place and achieve critical mass. Unfortunately, companies that could do this like Google or Microsoft are unlikely to do so. After all, they make their money by collecting and aggregating user data. We need an organization that has a huge user base that it can leverage, that is know for its consumer products, highly liked and trusted, committed to open-source, and has no opposing business interests.

And then it hit me. We already have such an organization: Mozilla. It's [mission statement](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/?icn=tabz) and ongoing support for a free and open internet makes them the perfect organization to spearhead such a development. Through Firefox, it already knows how to develop a consumer-grade, open-source product and I believe they might have the know-how and resources to do it.

This might not be the ultimate solution, but I believe it is a vital part of it. Today, mass surveillance is easy because transmissions are unencrypted and data is centralized. We might not be able to stop it, but we can make it too costly to do it on a broad scale without probable cause.

**TL;DR:** Mozilla is the only organization I know that has the experience and resources to develop consumer software that protects user privacy on the internet by default.",,False,,t5_2qhlc,1371365722.0,,,True,t3_1gfyxv,http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1gfyxv/an_open_letter_to_mozilla_the_key_to_fighting/,

I have been looking around for a more secure Dropbox alternative. Something that, preferably, encrypts my data locally before it gets uploaded.

I have looked at [Bitcasa](http://www.bitcasa.com/), which seems quite nice, but how can I be sure they actually do what they promise? I would much rather host it myself. OwnCloud, perhaps? The current version security seems, from a few google [hits](http://crypto.junod.info/2012/05/24/owncloud-4-0-and-encryption/), to be pretty low. Should be better in version 5, when that is released. But OwnCloud wont accept my 15-cifre, alpha-numerical-symbol password, so that is a no-go.

Are there any other alternatives I could look at? I wouldn't mind a hosted solution, but there must be some insurance in place so I can trust they actually encrypt the data locally and so on.

The solution should preferably be accessable from a desktop client, mobile client and web client.

And this won't happen until there are some real discussions of why privacy really matters.  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like there's much widespread conversation on this topic.

I've spent a lot of time thinking about technology.  Here are a few of the reasons that I care about privacy:

* I should never have to justify my browsing history to my employer
* Government/corporate surveillance needlessly increases the likelihood of criminals using my personal information
* I don't think that a wealthy or powerful person should be able to obtain any email that I've ever written  
* Democracy and freedom are incompatible with complete surveillance

Do any of these resonate with you?  Why do you care about privacy?  Do your friends and acquaintances have similar concerns?

- we need privacy to be able to freely experiment with our ideas and emotions; no privacy means less inner freedom to create and enjoy - for fear of repercussions; also, the need for secrecy in psychological therapy - why do we want to keep our discussions with our therapist secret? Because it's an inner space where we need to be free from judgements. We need this space in order to maintain our mental health, not just to create and experiment. NSA intercepts our personal search engine queries and the URLs we browse, annulling the sanctity of the inner space; we are one step away from thought police now.

**Usurping the social function of privacy**

- we tend to invoke privacy with regard to outsiders while opening up our minds and homes to friends; the more intimate a person is, the less privacy we require from them; privacy&lt;-&gt;intimacy is the social bond that ties people into societies; NSA is playing with the forces that regulate society on a basic level; did total surveillance just automatically add NSA to our list of ""friends"" whether we want it or not? the audacity!

**No financial privacy is bad for business**

- in order to do business we need financial privacy; we can't have our plans outed to our competition; if that's the case, then nobody would want to do business with the USA; the same is true for technology research and other fields

**We need privacy in order to be able to politically organize and protest bad government**

- when the government knows too much about our moves, that would empower them to silence dissidence and thus turn what's left of our democracy into tyranny all the faster; do they presume to say we don't need to protest the state any more?

**Psychological impact of ex-communist people**

- The people there had been spied on their entire lives and the damage was apparent. They were timid, they were afraid, they did not take risks. It's almost like they were children who had abusive parents, always careful not to get into trouble. Can you imagine what that would be like?

**False positives**

- A man sends an innocent text message to his colleagues at a trade show in New York City telling them to ""blow away"" the competition. This man has ""nothing to hide"" and that resulted in him being arrested, and searched, which is bad enough. But the worst part is that he was no longer able to get a certificate of good conduct which is required for his work in finance. Although he is totally innocent, he still lost his livelihood.
 
**Privacy protects our interests**

- from family to state, we need to protect our interests with privacy

**Meek, timid citizenry**

- Above all else, that’s what a Surveillance State does: it breeds fear of doing anything out of the ordinary by creating a class of meek citizens who know they are being constantly watched. ~ Glenn Greenwald

- That mindset creates the incentive to be as compliant and inconspicuous as possible: those who think that way decide it’s in their best interests to provide authorities with as little reason as possible to care about them.
 
**Future abuses**

- It's not really about privacy, it's about what the government can do with information. Do you trust the current administration with this information? What about every future administration? Do you trust President Bachmann with this information? How about President Gore? President Pelosi? President Cain?

- People may have nothing to hide with today's laws. What scares me is that say this goes on, and data is constantly collected. But then laws change for the worse, they become oppressive against liberties and freedoms.By not caring before you've allowed and infrastructure of data collection to be built and used in any manner they care to use it. They know if you're out past federal curfew, they know you spoke negatively to your friends about the government.

**Creativity**

- Ultimately privacy gives you a choice

- The difference between having your privacy and not, is the difference between you having the option of telling someone something, and not.

**Tyrany of the big brother**

- you would always be doing things that other people would expect you to do based on society's norms, which can be shaped by society and large organizations (government included)

**Secret laws, secret standards**

- ""illegal activity"" is, sometimes it is define behind close doors and in secrecy and you are not even capable of knowing what constitutes an ""illegal activity""


**Why do we keep our salaries secret?**

**Double standard**

- why the level of secrecy invoked in defense of national security is so different from the level of privacy allowed to people?

**USA wouldn't have been possible**

- Imagine, if you will, that the year is 1776 and there are cameras on every corner. All communications are recorded and analyzed. Drones roam the skies looking for would-be terrorists and strike down those deemed enemies of the state. How many of our founding fathers would have been targeted by drones before they were able to gain any sort of momentum? The constant surveillance would have allowed to British Empire to track all people involved, hear what they were planning, and use technologies against them so far beyond the average man's grasp that the movement could possibly have been stemmed quite quickly. Would America have even been possible? Or would we have remained under the watchful eye of the British Empire and kept under their thumb? What about Ghandi? Would he simply have been disappeared and the movement in India crushed as well? How many Jews would Hitler have apprehended if he possessed the technologies our government is moving towards?


**The first monitored will be the their own**

- The first monitored will be the politicians, business men, lawyers and activists, ironically. That's because their secrets are the most valuable.


**The difference between ""doing something wrong"" and ""preferring a modicum of privacy"" is the difference between ""assault"" and ""wearing underpants.""**

**Monitoring your peers**

- They're not just watching YOU, they're watching EVERYBODY, including those who can change society. Everyone you vote for, everyone running your company, everyone involved in any civil orgs, churches, or activism with you - they are being monitored. If any of them have secrets, either legal or illegal, the NSA can blackmail them to do their bidding.

**Knowledge is power.**

- Knowledge about something or someone gives you the ability to manipulate and potentially even totally control them.

**Corruption**

- The idea that only people who deserve punishment will receive it is naive and childish wishful thinking. Anyone who has ever had a run-in with a crooked police officer would know that.

**Indefensible**

- The government and its agents have more power than you. When it turns into what you say versus what they say, you're probably going to lose. People shouldn't be so foolish.


**Economic espionage**

- People discuss business strategies and political strategies over email and phone. Let's say my company is bidding on a large government contract and we share spreadsheets, get quotes from suppliers, discuss labor, margins, etc, all over email, phone and Skype. That information would be very valuable to my competition and if people inside the surveillance system are outside of any public oversight, it would be very tempting to try and take advantage of the access to this information. Insider trading has been illegal for a long time, but surveillance state is a perfect cover for gathering insider information from the outside.


**Legal espionage**

- the state to spy the lawyer of the accused to counter their strategy? can our lawyers be spared state surveillance when involved in a lawsuit with the state itself?


**Fallacy of - you did it to yourself**

- Facebook, twitter, instagram...we gave up our privacy long ago and it had nothing to do with the government and everything to do with marketing and profit.

**We already were lacking privacy**

- The government knows where you live, how many people live with you, how much money you make, where you were born, what cars you own, the list goes on. Not to mention privacy exposed on Facebook and other sites.


**What is private?**

- If you think a government shouldn't be able to put tabs on its own citizens, how is it possibly supposed to function? If you saw a cop arrest a man for assaulting another man, you would applaud the officer. But then what if the arrested claimed the law had no right to get involved, it was a private conflict? 


**Affirmation of privacy right**

- Not all things are for all people to hear (let alone government officials), especially private matters.

- Everyone has something to hide, because even innocent things can be weapons as information.


**Privacy is another form of intellectual property**

- Apple would never give away their secret technologies to the government. Neither would defense contractors working on their own research and development projects as their all based on profit earned, so may remain in hidden view by government entities.


**False dichotomy**

- That statement is basically a false dichotomy - the same kind of conundrum as ""you're either with us or against us."" It presents a false choice: you are either guilty of something and therefore have a reason to hide it, or you are not guilty of anything and therefore have no reason to hide anything. It is based on the (false) premise that privacy's sole purpose is to conceal wrongdoing, and it excludes the possibility that someone may be innocent of any wrongdoing buy may still want to conceal their activities. Why? Because something is embarrassing, but not wrong. Something may be deeply personal. Someone may have concerns about their information being used for marketing purposes or stolen. The list goes on and on. Basically...that's how you counter it.""""


**Ruthless self surveillance**

- Stalin spied on his own staff. Thats how you run a dictatorship.


**Manipulation**

- These secrets can be used against you and your friends to manipulate the system.

**Capability of abuse**

- A system such as that can be abused for many years without people even knowing because its a silent abuse.


**Need for a larger societal consensus**

- We must have a discussion as a human race of how to handle this kind of power, and build systems where such power will not be abused since not only US will spy on their own and other people this will probably happen all over the world.


**Innevitability**

- Because its possible we will be living in a spy world. The question is can our ""democracy"" system thats 2000 years old handle it?

**Presumption of innocence**

- We should be innocent until proven guilty, but with the invasive legislation of the past 5 years it would seem that we are being assumed guilty.

Said organization has taken a contract from a government agency.  The questions in this survey inquire into Americans' attitudes toward government agencies obtaining personal information by asking other organizations for it - for example, asking your health care provider for medical information as opposed to asking you in a survey.

In this survey, we are unable to disclose the people we are doing the survey for.  This, in itself, is hardly uncommon - in fact, in survey research, knowing who is behind the study can strongly bias responses.

Interestingly, even though interviewers are restricted in what we can say while on the respondent because of fears of biasing the responses, the questions themselves put forth in this survey are not just biased - they are preceded by a slew of information that is clearly designed to push people in the direction the client wishes.  The questions are all quite literally preceded by propaganda - and like I said, we are NOT allowed to disclose the ones funding this ""research,"" so as far as people know, it is just another poll by an organization that built its reputation on being trusted and unbiased.

I previously loved working for this company, and I certainly do need the money and health insurance I get by working there.  However, I also have a fervent love for this country and its citizens, and it enrages me to no end that this trusted organization is taking money from a government agency (read: tax money) to do horrendously biased and unethical research.  The worst of it is, at the end of this study, said agency will use the results of this ""study"" to convince people that the American people hold an opinion that they simply DO NOT hold.  They will use it to acquire funding, and potentially influence national policy - based on a LIE. Again, using YOUR MONEY to do it.

I posted this on /privacy because the subject matter of the ""research"" is directly related to privacy concerns, and I was hoping that the passion for privacy found here might get somebody angry enough that they might be able to help me.

As most of you probably know we're in a last minute and desperate battle against CISPA. In fact, some are predicting we'll lose this battle. I hope that is not the case. however, no matter what happens we can't keep fighting these things at the last minute. We need to also be proactive. We must not only be technically aware but we need the laws to at least be written in our favor (so that if they are broken we have means to fight).

In that light I wanted to link up to [r/FIA](http://www.reddit.com/r/FIA). It is a fairly new subreddit but I like what I see there. I think it is a place where r/privacy should have a voice and I encourage everyone to at least go over and take a look at what they are working on.

You guys have made this subreddit amazing in a really short period of time. I know you can help FIA get to the next level.

USE IT!

It's the same principle as the never talking to cops. Just applied to hard drives. Imagine your harddrive is a little person who is really talkative. You leave it unencrypted and it will talk to anyone who is close to it, without any restrictions on it's speech. You encrypt a folder or a file, and it will spill everything else but try to not talk about that file or folder, even though with all the peripheral information amalgamated it might start talking about your encrypted file or folder anyway. Now, you put full disk encryption on it, and your hard-drive basically has a keypad on it's mouth. It's not talking to anyone, not even you, till that keypad gets opened. Once it is open, it will continue to talk about everything, which is one thing a lot of people forget about FDE.

Bottom line, don't let your hard drive talk to cops (or anyone else) without a lawyer (you).


FDE needs to go mainstream.
