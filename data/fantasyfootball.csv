.

**MODS: I think its pretty clear we should add this to the list of our weekly threads. Not sure if you guys want FantasyMod to own it though, since I've been editing this post like whoa, but maybe some color highlighting to make it standout more?**

.

**Kevin Ogletree WR DAL** - Theres been plenty of talk here. I think we all know what he *can* do, the question is, will he. I'm personally not convinced, but should Dez/Austin/Witten get injured, he could emerge as a superstar (see: Laurent Robinson last season). Owned in 22.7% of ESPN leagues. 

**Alfred Morris RB WAS** - 28 carries for 96 yards 2 TDs - Owned in 10% of ESPN leagues - Warning: Be wary of WAS RBs. That said, Shanny runs the hot hand, and I consider this a hot hand.

**Aldrick Robinson WR WAS** - 4 rec for 52 yards 1 TD - Owned in **0%** of ESPN leagues - Started to shine when Garcon went out. Good stash and see potential. Seems to have the edge over Hankerson now.

**Stephen Hill WR NYJ** - 5 rec for 89 yards 2 TDs - Owned in 2.9% of ESPN leagues - Great separation all game. 

**Martellus Bennett TE NYG** - 4 rec for 40 yards 1 TD - Owned in 27% of ESPN leagues - Potential to be a poor man's Gronk/Graham

**Dexter McCluster RB (according to ESPN) KC** - 6 rec for 82 yards 0 TD - Owned in 5.2% of ESPN leagues - Looked great today and had a team high **10** targets. Great flex option in PPR. 

**Marcedes Lewis TE JAC** - 5 rec for 52 yards 1 TD - Owned in 4% of ESPN leagues - Not a bad start if Gabbert continues his decent play. CAUTION: Jac lost 2 O linemen. Lewis might be more of a blocker in future games.

**Randall Cobb WR GB** - 9 rec for 77 yards 1 TD (on a 75 yard punt return) - Owned in 12.2% of ESPN Leagues - Rodgers seems to like him a lot, 2nd in targets for the day behind Finley. He also caught *every* pass thrown at him. Also great value in the return game as he returned a punt 75 yards for a TD today. 

**Owen Daniels TE HOU** - 4 rec for 87 yards 0 TD - Owned in 83.4% of ESPN leagues - Shaub to Daniels is back? He had 8 targets, so it seems so.

**Cecil Shorts WR JAC** - 4 rec for 74 yards 1 TD - Owned in **0%** of ESPN leagues - Deep league target. Has potential, but is currently 4th in the pecking order behind Blackmon, L Robinson, and Lewis. *Might* have more value given Jac lost some O linemen, which would result in more blocking from Lewis.

**Alshon Jeffery WR CHI** - 3 rec for 80 yards 1 TD - Owned in 15% of ESPN leagues - Most of a stash player than a starter at the moment. He was 3rd in targets on the day (behind Marshall and Forte), but is still behind Hester on the depth chart. Has potential to be the new deep threat on Chi. 

**Andre Roberts WR ARI** - 5 rec for 54 yards 1 rush for 15 yards 1 TD - Owned in **.3%** of ESPN leagues - Second only to Fitz in targets (Dre had 9). Still a bit of a wait and see pickup in my opinion, but can turn into a solid PPR starter.

**Brandon LaFell WR CAR** - 3 rec for 65 yards 1 TD - Owned in 25.2% of ESPN leagues - #2 in Car, but possibly competing with Louis Murphy for targets. Cam seems far more comfortable with LaFell though. 

**Kyle Rudolph TE MIN** - 5 rec for 67 yards - Owned in 13.9% of ESPN leagues - Looks to be the #2 behind Harvin on Min. Great size. 

**Braylon Edwards WR SEA** - 5 rec for 43 yards - Owned in 9.2% of ESPN leagues - Tied Sidney Rice with 9 targets on the day. Looks to be the clear #2 on the field.

**Coby Fleener TE IND** - 6 rec for 82 yards - Owned in 29% of ESPN leagues - **10** targets today! One warning: a majority of his targets were during a two minute drill before halftime and in garbage time towards the end. Keep an eye out to see if he gets some more consistent looks throughout the game before thinking about making him your starter.

**Jeremy Kerley WR NYJ** - 4 rec for 45 yards 1 TD + 68 yard punt return for a TD - Owned in **.2%** of ESPN leagues - Swapped back and forth with Chaz Schilens at WR3. Viable starter in return yard leagues.

**Heath Miller TE PIT** - 4 rec for 50 yeards 1 TD - Owned in 6.3% of ESPN leagues - 3rd in targets tonight with 7 behind sanders and brown.

**Jonathan Dwyer RB PIT** - 9 rush for 43 yards, 2 rec for 11 yards - Owned in 23.5% of ESPN leagues - GUY RUNS LIKE A RHINOCEROUS. Stat line a bit misleading as he lost a 20~ yard run on a hold and lost a TD due to his knee being down close to the endzone. Caution: Mendy will likely be back soon and replace him. 

**James Jones WR GB** - 4 rec for 81 yards 1 TD - Owned in 14.1% of ESPN leagues - 6 targets today, but I think Cobb is the better target on GB. Jones will be boom or bust all season. Might be worth a look in deeper leagues.

**Bengals D/ST** - Owned in 9.2% of ESPN leagues - They play the Browns next week. Nuff said. A possible pickup *before* game time tomorrow. 

**Patriots D/ST** - Owned in 16.8% of leagues - Quietly have a monster front 7 this season (I'm a homer) who held CJ.4YPC to 11 yards from scrimmage. Getting past the trio of Mayo/Spikes/Hightower at the 2nd level will be challenging for most RBs. They will be playing the Cardinals next, who have Kolb at the helm again. 

**Browns D/ST** - Owned in .8% of ESPN leagues - Scored 19 points in ESPN standard against a tough Philly Offense. Bengals and Buffalo are their next two opponents, so they could be a solid pickup through week 3. NOTE: Joe Haden has been suspended for 4 games.

**Dennis Pitta TE BAL** - Owned in 2.2% of ESPN leagues - 5 rec for 73 yards 1 TD. Flaccos favorite target (**9** targets!). Great size. Might be the top TE target on the wire. 

**Andrew Hawkins WR CIN** - Owned in **0%** of ESPN leagues - Second only to AJ on Cincy. 8 rec on 9 targets for 86 yards. Looks like Dalton'2 #2 guy just barely ahead of Gresham. 

Couple people have asked about QBs. I don't think there are any worth starting *yet*, but here are some stash targets.

**Russell Wilson QB SEA** - Owned in 37.7% of ESPN leagues - 18/34 153 yards 8 carries for 20 yards 1 TD 1 INT - Could have had 2 TDs, but Braylon Edwards played like Braylon Edwards. Nothing spectacular here, but not a terrible rookie start.

**Sam Bradford QB STL** - Owned in 47% of ESPN leagues - 17/25 198 yards 1 TD - Nothing crazy good, but a 105.1 passer rating is respectable. NOTE: The STL C and LT went out with foot injuries in this game. Depending on their status, Bradford could slide back to last years form due to lack of protection.

**Joe Flacco QB BAL** - Owned in 93% of ESPN leagues - Dude is legit. If you are part of the lucky 7% GET THIS MAN IMMEDIATELY.

**Christian Ponder QB MIN** - Owned in 5.5% of leagues - 20/27 270 yards 0 TD 0 INT - Nothing amazing, but he looked better and better as the game progressed. Could be decent BYE week filler depending on matchup.

**Blaine Gabbert QB JAC** - Owned in 2.9% of leagues - 23/39 260 2 TD 0 INT - Solid showing out the gate. He was not without mistakes, but if he continues on this path he could also be a solid BYE week start.

1374848115.0,389,self.fantasyfootball,1j3isn,"Since now is the time of year everyone starts asking, ""What Is the Best Fantasy Website?"", here is a definitive list I have gathered over the years",451,62,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1j3isn/since_now_is_the_time_of_year_everyone_starts/,"Each of these sites are beneficial. Some are weekly rankings, some are breaking fantasy news sites, trade analyzers, draft simulators and even a site that shows you what games will be shown in each US city.

Of course there are thousands of sites...but these have helped me a lot. I've been playing for 8 years now and I have won 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012.

Most of you already know these sites. But for those of you that don't you're welcome. One of my personal favorites is Rotomania.com. It allows you to ask polls on who to start/bench and it get's responded on by other fantasy players. Just do your research, pay attention, and be obsessed.

I'm ALWAYS looking to add to this list. If you have a preferential website that isn't listed, leave it as a comment, hopefully this post can be helpful to anyone that comes across it. 

Good Luck!

Big fan of Redzone.  This week you had a tough challenge: only 2 afternoon games.

With only 2 games on at once, there wasn't a ton of redzone action to cover.  Furthermore, against all reasonable expectations, both games were frequently in commercial at the same time, and they both went to the half at the same time.  You had a lot of time to fill.

Nonetheless, you did it like a champ - despite the slow pace, you still gave us relief from the commercials and carried your weight with above average commentary throughout.

Here's to you, Scott Hanson.

Starting Sunday, the mod team has the green light to begin transitioning to a more active role.  For those of you just dying to show off your fancy new logo, please be my guest to start up or revive one of the half dozen /r/fantasyfootball spin-offs, but lets keep /r/fantasyfootball content-rich and reward the guys who are doing solid analysis instead of the dude plastering faces on boobs and cashing in on 3 times the karma...we're better than that folks!

Fair warning!

Use the report button if someone is being an intolerable douche or drop us a line using the ""message the mods"" button in the sidebar.

First and foremost, let me say that I love how active this community it.  As I'm currently writing this, there are over 300 people on this subreddit.  That is very exciting!

I'm just like all of you fantasy football owners. I'm 1-3 in both my leagues with teams that have under performed across the board.  And yes, I am very bitter about it.

But /r/fantasyfootball needs to change.  Our community is getting too bogged down with so many repetitive posts.  'Do I need to start this person?'  'Pick 3 out of these 4 players.'  I understand we all want advice.  Me and others in this community would love to know how much value Chris Johnson is worth on the trade market, but we need to work together.

There is already a section at the top for 'Who Do I Start?'  And it's even separated into positions!  We need to utilize these resources that we have.  

I also think that there needs to be a section for trades, where people can find out how much their players are going for in other leagues.  If you can't find what you are looking for, make a new comment!  I'm sure that post will help the next person down the road.  The more we use this, the better the thread will be.  Also, I know things change week to week.  A new topic should be created weekly to account for these changes.

Final:  **Ravens 44, Bengals 13**

Final:  **Chargers 22, Raiders 14**

Fantasy Recap: 

**Baltimore**

* **Joe Flacco:** 21/29 299 yards, 2 TD 0 INT (Looked solid.  Great arm strength.)
* **Ray Rice:** 10 carries 68 yards, 2 TDs, 3 catches 25 yards (Every bit the #1.5 Fantasy Back)
* **Torrey Smith:** 2 catches 57 yards, 1 carry 13 yards (Ravens' #1 receiver - don't panic)
* **Anquan Boldin:** 4 catches 63 yards 1 TD, 1 carry 3 yards (A good flex play)
* **Jacoby Jones:** 3 catches 46 yards (had a good drive - clearly not reliable)
* **Dennis Pitta** 5 catches 73 yards, 1 TD (Dickson makes him a wildcard)

**Cincinnati**

* **Andy Dalton:** 22/37 221 yards, 0 TDs 1 INT (Tough start, but has 3 good receivers going forward)
* **AJ Green:** 5 catches 70 yards  (Not a stellar day, but clearly highly targeted) 
* **Benjarvus Green-Ellis:** 18 carries 91 yards 1 TD, 1 catch 4 yards (Fantasy owners should be pleased with his performance.  Approaching RB1 territory)
* **Jermaine Gresham:** 3 catches 30 yards (Disappointing. Lot of TE depth out there to supplant him on fantasy rosters)
* **Andrew Hawkins:** 8 catches 86 yards (Nothing like a big MNF game to put you on people's radars)

**Oakland**

* **Carson Palmer:** 32/46 297 yards, 1 TD, 0 INTs (A solid fantasy day, due to a ton of throws.  Poor man's Drew Brees?)
* **Darren McFadden:** 15 rushes 32 yards, 13 catches 86 yards (A very Forte-esque day.  He's every PPR player's dream RB.)
* **Darrius Heyward-Bey:** 3 catches 43 yards (It was a ragged day, but Heyward-Bey had opportunities to shine.  Continues to disappoint - perhaps the most overpaid player in the NFL.)
* **Rod Streater:** 4 catches 27 yards, 1 TD (Could be a serviceable deep-league flex play, but this Raiders receiving core isn't appealing so far.)
* **Brandon Myers** 5 catches 61 yards (You can find better TEs than Myers, but today's day wasn't awful.)

**San Diego**

* **Phillip Rivers:** 24/33, 231 yards, 1 TD, 0 INTs (The lack of turnovers is encouraging.)
* **Antonio Gates:** 4 catches 43 yards (Another injury scare. Surprised?)
* **Robert Meachem:** 2 catch 49 yards (Caught a bomb.  Then disappeared.)
* **Malcolm Floyd:** 4 catches 66 yards, 1 TD (Looked very good. Has the egde for #1 Chargers receiver)
* **Ronnie Brown:** Gross. Who really cares, right?  Get healthy already, Mathews.  Brinkley had a bad running day - 1.2 ypc - but 3 catches for 28 yards.  Brinkley may get the start next week if Mathews can't play.

1348841127.0,234,self.fantasyfootball,10m9za,Overreaction theatre.,261,27,130,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/10m9za/overreaction_theatre/,"The fact that you're on this subreddit (and/or NarFFL/fantasyfb) means you're smarter than your average jamoke in the office league. With this in mind, and the fact that we're only one game into week 4, the key to being successful at this point is to not overreact to anything, but instead, to profit off of people who do overreact.


There's nothing to suggest that Dennis Pitta isn't going to be part of the offense going forward. He had a wide open TD opportunity and fell down last night. Cleveland's not bad against TEs since they clog up the middle of the field. I'd almost go as far as to say he was the guy they wanted to stop, since Anquan Boldin and Torrey Smith are inconsistent. Cleveland may have been willing to take a chance on those guys not making plays, but not letting Pitta beat them.


He went almost completely undrafted, so unless you dropped someone important to pick him up, you're still playing with house money owning a TE on a newly-revamped offense that throws a lot. And most of your roster hasn't even played yet this week. Same with the other guy. For all you know the other guy you're playing is in line for an ACL injury to his star player.


Conversely, if you benched Anquan Boldin, you probably made a good decision to play someone more established. His standard scoring so far: 12, 0, 4. And 13 last night. Unless you're hurting at WR, that's not worth getting upset over.

It's obviously frustrating to make an incorrect start/sit decision, but complaining that you started Aaron Rodgers over Carson Palmer (just an example) is like complaining that you folded your bottom pair in a Texas Holdem game and would've eventually made four of a kind. Results-oriented thought processes are what lead to more bad decisions in the future and it's a slippery slope. 


Look at what you drafted, or what you picked up in free agency. Use the information all over the internet, watch the games and make your own judgments. If your late round fliers on draft day haven't worked out and you luck into a good waiver wire pickup, temper your expectations. There's a reason this guy wasn't part of the first 192 people taken. 


If your receiver is underperforming, go back and look at the box score and the play by play. Did he get targets? Were there drops? Did another receiver benefit from your guy getting double-coverage? If so, RELAX. That won't happen every week. There's a reason you took Marques Colston in the 5th-6th round, because he normally finishes with 80 catches and 1,000 yards but he'll have some bad weeks. Same with Vincent Jackson. 


Look at everyone who scrambled to pick up Kevin Ogletree after week 1. They may have looked at the box score and gone crazy. Now that Miles Austin and Jason Witten are healthier, Ogletree is back to being the #4 option on that team. 


I'm absolutely not saying ""don't complain"". It's a forum, and fantasy misery loves company. But don't go blowing your team up because you started 1-2. There's a lot of football to be played.

**TL;DR: CALM DOWN. You're smarter than a lot of other people in your league. If you're losing or in a tough spot, get your shit together but don't panic.**",Quality Post!!!,False,,t5_2qlqq,1348841435.0,qualitypost,,True,t3_10m9za,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/10m9za/overreaction_theatre/,

The numbers are accurate as of Sunday night, and are taken from [NFL.com's Standard Scoring Fantasy Points Against page](http://fantasy.nfl.com/research/pointsagainst?position=4&amp;statCategory=pointsAgainst&amp;statSeason=2012&amp;statType=seasonPointsAgainst&amp;statWeek=7#pointsAgainst=pointsAgainst%2C%2Fresearch%2Fpointsagainst%253Fposition%253D2%2526statCategory%253DpointsAgainst%2526statSeason%253D2012%2526statType%253DseasonPointsAgainst%2526statWeek%253D7%2Creplace), which shows the average amount of points scored by a certain position against a particular defense.  These are broken down by team schedule, and are additionally sorted by position and include weeks 14-16, standard fantasy playoffs for most teams.  Teams are sorted by average score during the three week playoffs, but each individual playoff week is listed as well.  Should be a good reference to use making trades during the coming week or two.  For example, as a Cam Newton owner, I was able to see that he has a tough matchup during the first week of the playoffs, and made a trade to acquire Andrew Luck as my backup, who has a very good matchup during that same week.

Please upvote this to further the conversation and to allow other users to see this and have it in their arsenal to go out and improve their championship chances!  Let's bring home as many trophies as we can!!

EDIT:  Please note, these charts are essentially showing the strength of schedule, and should obviously be taken with a grain of salt.  This is NOT saying that, for instance, Mark Sanchez will perform better than Rodgers/Brady/Brees/Mannings etc.  What it IS saying though is that Sanchez has the easiest schedule for a QB during the playoffs (JAC, TEN, SD), or in other words, the teams that have, on average, given up the most points to opposing QBs thus far this season.  Hope that clarifies

EDIT 2:  Please note that the team listed on the chart is the team your hypothetical player plays for.  For instance, if you want to see the strength of schedule for Andrew Luck, you would look under the Colts row in the Quarterbacks chart.",Quality Post!!!,False,,t5_2qlqq,1351000371.0,qualitypost,,True,t3_11xlwl,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/11xlwl/playoffs_you_kidding_me_2012_fantasy_playoff/,

Thanks for the input so far guys. To address some concerns

- **Missing Players**: This is a subset of data, using a list from ESPN for the top 300 players. Their list misses some huge players, so I'll just make my own.
- **WTF? Connor Barth?**: Yeah, that's stupid. There was a bogus trade in the data that was probably vetoed. I'm changing my script to only look for *processed* trades rather than just accepted to eliminate some of the crap. I can also have it only list players that appear in more than X number of trades, and weight later weeks higher.
- **Numbers are hard to read**: Yes they are. I can multiply them by a factor and just set the top player to ""1"". 
- **The 50% Rule**: I'm looking at this a bit further. It might need to be tweaked a bit, but I think the logic is sound. The ideal thing to do would be to add the value of the ""next best player"" you would either be dropping or could add off the WW.
- **These numbers are crap and you are crap and I hate you and your numbers and you as well**: As I said, this is alpha. I honestly think I'm onto something, and have come to you guys first. Please keep in mind I'm spending my free time (and money) trying to build a tool to help people out :)

------------------------------
I did it guys! It works!

Quick Link: http://paste2.org/p/2343480

A few weeks ago, I had the idea to use public fantasy league trade data to somehow ""assign"" values to players. With those values, you could see immediately whether or not a trade was fair.

Well, after lots of trial and effort, I managed to do it! I crawled through all the ESPN public leagues (~1,200,000 of them) and grabbed all the trades. Some python and scipy magic later, out popped values of the players. My sanity check was that Arian Foster, Ray Rice, and Calvin Johnson should all be somewhere around each other at the top. Lo and behold, they were the top 3 values:

    Arian Foster:   0.0075179
    Ray Rice:       0.0074077
    Calvin Johnson: 0.0071362

**How to Use it**

- For 1:1, 2:2, and so on ""even ratio"" trades, you can simply compare the sum of their values. 1+1 = 0.75+1.25. Simple.
- For uneven trades (this is important), it's a bit more complicated, but not much. For every player traded in excess of the other side, you must give a 50% boost over the total. *What*? See the following example:

 - **Trade Offer**: Willis McGahee + Kyle Orton FOR Arian Foster.
 - **Values**: Assume Arian Foster = 1, and Willis McGahee and Kyle Orton are both = 0.5.
 - **Incorrect Usage**: A naive calculation would be 0.5 + 0.5 = 1, making the trade fair. It is NOT. I would hope none of you would make this trade.
 - **Correct Usage**: Instead,there are TWO players for ONE, (2-1) = 1. Thus, you need a 50% boost of Fosters value for this trade to be fair, which would be 1.5.
 - The only trade considered fair would then be 2 players of 0.75 value, say Reggie Wayne and Stevan Ridley. The algorithm will call this trade fair, since .75 + .75 = 1.5 = 1 * 1.5
 - If it were 3 players for 1? You guessed it - 100% of the single players value. All 3 would need to add up to a value of ""2"" in the Foster case.

**Caveats**

- This is the first pass. There will be many passes, improvements, and updates.
- My algorithm did not differentiate between PPR and Standard leagues or the league size. Should it have? Absolutely. Why doesn't it? Well...it takes about 1 second to grab data for every league. That's already 1.2 million seconds, or **13.8 days of running time**. I am able to farm this work out to AWS EC2, but I can't do much more without incurring big costs. Checking league types would add 1 second on every league, literally doubling execution time.
- I need to find a way to get more data. If a players only has one multi-pronged trade, the algo will have lots of trouble will their values.
- It doesn't deal well with IDPs (because so few people play with them), so I've left them out for now.
- It does NOT take into account your personal team. You need to do this. Don't accept a trade for 2 qbs if you already have Rodgers.
- I eliminated weeks 0-1. They were very noisy and aren't all that relevant now.

Well that's it. Top 300 player values, with trades up to 10/14. 

Any suggestions for me? Do you like it? Has it worked for you? Let me know!

It seems like it might be easy for some people to miss over football news and end up drafting big name players who are normally a great pick but actually would get screwed this year if they picked them. Just an extra resource for people?


We don't care about your personal opinion on whether this QB has no targets or this RB is in a RBBC or this WR has bad routes. All we care about is, who will literally get you zero points? Who will contribute absolutely nothing and will be a waste of a draft spot?



For example, these players are out for the season due to injury or... murder if not specified otherwise  

* Aaron Hernandez  
* Dennis Pitta  
* Jeremy Maclin  
* Michael Crabtree  (Possibly not out for the season so maybe worth watching the waiver wire)
* Percy Harvin (Specific injury details coming this week so read up before drafting)  
* Ryan Swope
* Heath Miller (Coming back from surgery so look at injury status before drafting)
* Jason Hanson  
* Chris Cooley  
* Ronde Barber 
* Armon Binns    
* Santonio Holmes (Specific injury details coming this week so read up before drafting)
* Connor Barth  
  
*unsigned free agents* These players are good but are not yet on a team so keep an eye out  

* Willis McGahee  
* Beanie Wells  
* Michael Turner  
* Jahvid Best (RIP his career)  
* Brandon Lloyd (Keep an eye out on him though as the preseason goes on)  
* Laurent Robinson  
* Austin Collie  
* Titus Young (Ha)  
* Dallas Clark  



*Players who are suspended* These players will benefit from lower end draft picks but are costly at the upper half because of the fact they will be missing games  
  
* Justin Blackmon - 4 games  
* Von Miller (Pending, and only if you play IDP) - 4 games    
* Bruce Irvin (Only if you play IDP) - 4 games  
* Jarvis Jenkins (Only if you play IDP) - 4 games  
* Josh Gordon - 2 games  
* Isaiah Pead - 1 game  
* Daryl Washington (Only if you play IDP) - 4 games
* Lavon Brazill - 4 games

RotoViz.com really values the Reddit fantasy football community and so we changed the way our paywall works just to make it easier for you to read our articles without seeing a subscription message.

Our paywall was always meant to allow a free view per day to accommodate discussion forums like Reddit. But that didn't work in some cases because people would click to our site, then click back, and then try to click the site again after having used up their free view. We've changed the code on our site so that if you're clicking from Reddit, it should let you read the article you're clicking to even if you've already used a free view.

A few years ago a ""friend"" of mine (notice the quotes) who I met at the place I was working at the time approached me about joining his Fantasy league. He told me that he and some friends of his from home (none of whom I had met) had a league.

These were lifelong friends, and they've been doing this league since their Freshman year of College (I'm 30, if that gives you a time frame). He said one of their other friends had dropped out, and they were looking for another player. I had never done Fantasy before, but as a huge football fan, I figured I'd give it a try.

Season 1 - I met everyone on Draft Day, nice bunch of people. I obviously had no idea what I was doing fantasy wise, but I had fun and was learning how to play. Essentially, I was in last place.

Season 2 - I had a better understanding of Fantasy strategy after doing research and learning from my previous season. I did better, but still didn't make the playoffs. Still had fun with the group.

Season 3 - I was one spot away from the playoffs, and every game mattered for me because the final spot in the playoffs came down to the last game of the season. Fun time. Had a blast.

Last Season - Best season I've ever had. I made the playoffs, had an awesome run, made the championship game, and came in second place. For the first time I actually had a payout for the season. I was thrilled and psyched for this season.

Fast forward to this week.

Traditionally the Yahoo invites come the beginning of August, so when this week rolled around and I didn't get one I figured I'd call my buddy to see what was up.

I call no answer. Shoot him a text, no response.

Then yesterday on Facebook I get a message, ""Hey man, we all talked and after you came in second last season we voted and opted not to have you in the league this year. We've all been doing this since College and we didn't really like the idea of one of the original players not being in the Championship Game. Hope you understand.""

I was pissed. Like a laughing ""this is so stupid"" level of pissed.

Basically it was fine to take my money for 3 seasons, but heaven forbid I actually learn and become successful.

Anyways, I still have other leagues I'm playing in, so all is well in the world, but I figured this story was so out of the box ridiculous that it needed to be shared.",,False,,t5_2qlqq,False,,,True,t3_yqzgg,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/yqzgg/i_got_kicked_out_of_a_fantasy_league_ive_been_in/,

VONA is a strategy where you try to estimate how many players from each position will disappear before you get to draft again and then pick based on what you stand to lose from passing over the best player in each position.

I went through an example in the ""Legend"" tab if anyone's curious, and even if you're not interested in this particular strategy I hope you'll find a use for the data---I included a power ranking graph that shows how quickly quality drops off in each position. Hope this helps and good luck in your drafts!

What is waiver fodder in a 10-team league can be must-own in 14-team. 

2) Post your scoring rules.  .5-PPR, 6 point passing TD, Standard, etc. will suffice.  If you have very weird rules but it doesn't matter for your question, lie and say 'standard'.

3) For Who Do I Start questions, post the opponent, please.  I know mostly who is playing who, but when giving advice I don't want to look it up.  I'm lazy.  So: [WDIS] Ridley @Buf or Greene v. Mia

4) For trades, or waiver pickups, post your whole roster.  It helps to get some context when giving advice.  You can get general advice anywhere on the web, I imagine you come to this subreddit for more in depth advice, and we want to give it.

5) Don't be afraid to give advice.  This subreddit is very give-and-take and I don't want you to be afraid to give.  You're not a professional, but if you're going to ask for advice, go do some research for someone else!


Also, look around at the comments below - there is plenty of good advice to be had from other looking to help!

I took data from over 1000 NarFFL leagues to see if draft position affects average wins and average points scored in the regular season.,180,23,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/14bw2k/does_the_season_end_as_soon_as_draft_order_is/,"This is my first real year of competitive fantasy football as I joined one of NarFFL alt leagues. I had the #1 pick and finished the season 8-5 as the 5th seed in the playoffs. I wanted to find out if I only had a good season because I had the #1 draft pick, so I used league data from http://narffl.com/standings.php to find out. Here's what I found:

I split the data into NarFFL Premier League teams and NarFFL Alt League teams. There are fewer Premier League teams, but they tend to be more active and competitive. Alt League teams suffered more from teams that were replaced after several weeks of inactivity.

**NarFFL Premier League.** Data taken from 12 leagues (144 teams):

* [Average Wins](http://i.imgur.com/spxjg.png)

* [Average Points](http://i.imgur.com/afuLJ.png)

**NarFFL Alt League.** Data taken from 112 leagues (1344 teams):

* [Average Wins](http://i.imgur.com/qFQfa.png)

* [Average Points](http://i.imgur.com/vO0c4.png)

Some useful info for interpreting these results:

* All NarFFL leagues are 12-team non-keeper leagues. Snake draft. 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 RB/WR/TE, 1 K, 1 DEF starters. 1 PPR. 4 points Pass TD. Full rules [here](http://narffl.com/rules.php).

* [ADP in NarFFL leagues](http://narffl.com/stats.php) (located at bottom of page).

Obviously, there's a lot of variables that affect these results throughout the entire season such as waiver pickups, trades, scheduling luck, etc. That being said, it's surprising that, in Alt Leagues, we can still see that the #1 draft pick was worth over 1.5 more wins and over 100 more points than the #12 draft pick. We can also compare dips in the data to ADP to notice that these dips may have been caused by where typical ""bust"" players were drafted. A lot of busts were available for picks 10-12, so this may be another explanation for the trends. Let me know what you guys think of this data.

Special thanks to NarFFL and fleaflicker for the league data.

1349983068.0,156,self.fantasyfootball,11bolz,Remember me? I answered about 250 questions last week and took 8 hours to do so. Here is an insanely detailed Statistic of how well i did!,186,30,558,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/11bolz/remember_me_i_answered_about_250_questions_last/,"Hey again :)



So last week i answered questions for 8 hours and more about WDIS and trade questions. I took a long time to do a statistic for the WDIS questions now cause i was curious how well i did. [The link of that thread can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/10vww9/free_day_and_ive_been_answering_tons_of_new_posts/)



Let me first say that some of the questions didn't seem to have a certain answer who you should take. I sometimes used the phrase ""if you want to be safe, take X, if you want to risk, use Y"". In those cases i used the safer person as the one i ""took"" as to me you'd rather go safe than risk it. In some cases people actually told me who they took, as well. Some i left out cause the answer wasn't clear. But i tried to be fair and not leave those out i knew i had wrong lol. 



Let me also say that players like Benson and Amendola were asked a lot and ended up getting hurt fairly early in the game, resulting in them causing a lot of bad points in that statistics. Obviously i understand you would still lose those points in your games as well, but i feel like its tough to put that on me getting my analyzing wrong. I did leave them in the statistic though! So dont worry.



I encourage you all to read through this in detail since its quite fascinating. I hope this doesnt get buried by the WDIS threads this week and that many people see this :)



Alright, lets start:





* There were 68 decisions in which i had to choose between two players and one of them started. The 68 players i chose ended up beating the 68 bench players 617.88 to 500.76 or 9.88 to 7.36 if you go per player. I got 38 of them right and 30 wrong. Although it has to be said that with those 38 winners i was able to make 320.6 points more than the person i benched at that point, while only lost 149.5 with those who i benched wrongly. That means if you took my advice and i got it right, i got you 8.4 points more, while if i was wrong, you only lost 4.9. I take that as a pretty good result to be honest.



* There were 10 games in which i had to pick 2 starters and 1 bench spot. In 4 of the 10 i picked the best two guys, in 4 of 10 i picked the worst two guys and in two games i had the best and the worst player. Seems pretty much neutral here. On the over hand you can look at this one pretty negative, as  my players made 8.495 points in average while the bench spot made 9.57... Obviously it could be argued that getting 2 of 3 right can be tough, but yeah, that one I'm not too happy about.



* In 14 situations i had to pick 1 starter and 2 bench spots. I did very well here. In 8 of those 14 i picked the player who got the most points. In only 2 i picked the worst one. My players made 8.32 per player while my bench only had 5.913 per player. If you only count the best bench player vs my player, it is pretty much neutral, both scoring between 8 and 9 points per average. Still I'm pretty happy with this one.



* In 9 situations i had to pick 2 starters and 2 bench spots. This s arguably my best one. In 4 of those 9 situations i picked the best 2 players, while i picked the worst two in none of those. (The rest were two times the best and third best, once the best and 4th best, once the 2nd and 3rd best and once the 2nd and 4th best). My two players scored 254.9 points compared to 91.2 of the bench. That equals 28.322 to 10.1 when you count each game and 14.161 to 5.0667 when you count them per player. Even if you view my worst player i picked to start versus the bench player who scored the most points, my starters still won 73 to 64.7 or 8.1111 to 7.1889 per player. I am insanely happy about this one. Those seem to be the best stats.



* In 7 cases i had to pick 3 starters and 1 bench spot. I did pretty good here too in my eyes. In three cases i picked the best 3 players and in the other four cases i had the best, the 3rd and the 4th best. That means my average starter had 13.49 points compared to 7.54 for the bench. If you only count the worst of my 3 starters in each situation, the bench barely beat me by 7.54 to 6.03 which i dont think is that bad. I would argue that in this kind of situations you could lose a bunch if you bench the wrong guy or if one of the 3 starters has a bad game which essentially is that last statistic.



* In 6 situations i had to pick 1 starter and 3 bench spots. This was one of my best as well. In four of the six situations i chose the best guy, once the worst and once the 2nd best. Average score per playeer was 10.13 to 5.88. If you only count my player versus the best of the bench players in each situation, i still win 10.13 to 8.9 which is pretty astonishing to me. I mean that basically means that the best of 3 people still wasn't better on average that the one i picked. Very happy with that one.



* In another 6 situations i had to pick 2 starters and 3 bench spots. This is pretty tough to analyze. I picked the best two players once, never the worst two. In any combination i had the best player in 4 of 6 combinations and the second best in 2 of 6, the worst player only once in any combination. Points wise on average my starters scored 12.3 and the bench 5.8 but if you take my worst choice versus the best bench player the bench beats me 9.4 to 6.1... I dont know how to feel about that one. I dont think its bad. Picking 2 out of 5 is pretty random anyway.



* In two situations i had to pick 3 starters and 3 bench spots. I picked 2nd 3rd and 4th best in one situation and 1st 4th and 5th in the other. If you calculate the amount of points you potentially lost that would have been 10.6 per game and if you calculate the points you potentially gained compared to the worst combination, you gained 24.3. Basically just as random and not sure how to feel about that.



* In one situation i had to pick 2 starters and 4 bench spots. I got the 1st and 3rd best player in that one. 11.05 to 5.1 on average but my worst choice was beat by the best bench player easily by 14.2 to 5.5



* One situation had me pick 3 starters and 4 bench spots. I picked the best 3 players there. Great success here although pretty random too. My starters had 16.6 compared to 3.625 on the bench. My worst player had 6 points, the best bench spot barely below that with 5.9



* And finally once i had to pick one starter and FIVE bench spots. I managed to pick the best choice there as well getting 14.7 points compared to 13.2 for the best bench spot and 6.4 bench points on average.




I think thats it. I will check to see if i forgot anything and if anyone has any questions feel free to ask. I will try to answer them. Or if anyone has any suggestions for other stats that are missing, let me know too.



ALright, have fun people :)

I know a lot of people here feel this way. It was buried in the middle of an article, so I just copied and pasted it, but it's from today's article on ESPN.com.

&gt;I hate, hate, hate the veto. It's the coward's way out. If I was suddenly made the ruler of all things fantasy, there would never be a veto except in cases of obvious, provable collusion. And in that case, only the commissioner or host website for the league should wield that power.

&gt;Understand these two key things: The art of negotiating is a skill in fantasy. That's part of running a fantasy team. A huge part, in fact. It's a skill that is admired and sought after in real-life general managers, so why should this be any different?

&gt;And second, it is not your job to coach someone else's team. I don't care if you think that tight end isn't nearly enough for that quarterback/running back combo. The only thing that matters is that the guy getting the tight end thinks so. Everyone should be allowed -- encouraged, in fact -- to coach their own team. Even if it's stupidly.

&gt;Because I have news for you. No one ever knows. I remember one of the first email flame wars I got into about a trade I made just after the draft one year, still in the preseason. In my longtime league with all my college buddies (a dynasty league), I traded a package of players for, in essence, Brett Favre, then one of the best quarterbacks in fantasy. It was a depth-for-a-superstar deal, perfectly legit, but the league went nuts because the only quarterback the guy was getting back was a recently promoted backup who had just got the job because the starter had been injured in preseason.

&gt;I argued the point of the deal was to give him depth at running back and wide receiver, which is what the guy said he wanted. He was happy, I was happy, what's the issue? On and on they complained. Until about Week 3 or 4, when they realized the backup quarterback I had dealt, Kurt Warner, was embarking upon his 1999 ""Greatest Show on Turf"" season, and would be better than Favre would ever be.

&gt;No one has argued about a trade in that league since.

&gt;I'll say it again. As long as both teams feel the deal helps their team, regardless of whether you agree, it MUST GO THROUGH. I especially can't stand the people who block a trade just because it doesn't involve them or because it's part of their ""strategy"" to block other teams from improving. That's the coward's way out and you're a scummy, spineless punk if you do that.

&gt;I've said it before, will say it again. Win on the virtual field, not by manipulating the rules.

1355410203.0,135,self.fantasyfootball,14sbpv,PSA #2: Don't put Thursday players in your flex spot,173,38,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/14sbpv/psa_2_dont_put_thursday_players_in_your_flex_spot/,"**TL;DR:** Just another reminder to not put Thursday players in your flex spot, plus an example.

I posted this last week, but just in case anyone missed it (a lot of people are checking this subreddit for the first time because it's the first week of playoffs in many leagues): It's **always** a bad idea to put a Thursday player in your flex spot when you can instead put him in a regular RB or WR slot because it will give you less options to choose from if one of your other starters needs to be benched later in the week due to injury.

Here's an example: Say your league starts 2 RBs, 2 WRs, and 1 Flex, and you decide that you want to start McFadden, Murray, Bryce Brown (playing tonight), Marshall, and Wayne.

* If you start Bryce Brown in your flex (bad move) and then on Sunday morning you find out that McFadden won't play, your only option is to replace McFadden with a RB from your bench. Unless you have a good 4th RB, you're screwed.
* If you start Bryce in your RB spot (good move) and then McFadden is declared out on Sunday, you'd have Brown and Murray in your RB spots, and then you could replace McFadden with a RB or WR in your flex spot.

Here's a good guideline to follow: When you create or adjust your lineup, place the players into your lineup starting in the order that they'll play their games, filling up all non-flex spots first. In other words, say your league starts RB, RB, WR, WR, Flex, and that you've decided to start 3RBs and 2 WRs. Whichever RB plays latest would go in your flex spot. What you should **not** do is put someone like Bryce Brown in your flex spot simply because he's your 3rd-best RB.

If you are curious about someone I didn't list here, or have any other questions, feel free to ask.  Only PM me if you really need to/don't want your reddit competition to see :)  
  
First things first.  If you're reading this and **Nate Washington** is available on waivers, go get him now or put a request in for him.  It's ok, I'll wait here for you.  Got him?  Ok, good.  
  
Other WRs:  
**Titus Young** - The one downfall with this pickup is the fact that Mr. Calvin Johnson Jr. is and always be the WR to own in Detroit.  On the plus side, it seems that Stafford has been effortlessly throwing 300yds/3TDs a game.  This guy should be a decent WR5/6 in 10 team.  
  
**Victor Cruz** - Hixon out for the year, and little to no competition at WR3 in New Jersey.  Manningham concussed, Nicks eternally banged up, opportunity knocking.  Don't expect every week to be like this past one, but even with the 2 outside guys healthy, Cruz may have the chance to flourish ala Steve Smith as the slot guy for the giants.  
  
**Torrey Smith** - It's not every year a rookie WR has his first career catch be a TD, nevermind the first 3.  This guy has the afterburners to take the top off the defense - the same thing Lee Evans was brought in to do.  With his injury, don't expect Evans to do that.  If Smith can keep this up and prevent his pre-season concrete hands from returning, expect him to be the WR2 across from Boldin.  
  
**Donald Jones/David Nelson** - I prefer Nelson just on the 6'5"" frame alone, but either way, Buffalo doesn't seem to have any sort of run offense in the red zone anyway.  Both are worthy of a bottom roster spot in 10+team leagues.  
  
**Michael Jenkins** - Firstly, I'm not sure who this guy thinks he is wearing #84 on the Vikings.  Veteran WR who is just about eclipsing his 2010 totals already.  He seems to be clicking with McNabb, and grabbed 9 of his 11 targets yesterday.  Not the best of WRs out there, but i'm sure some of you 12-16 team league guys may be looking for someone.  BONUS POINTS if Harvin's headaches come back/injury.
  
**Pierre Garcon** - Anyone catch Curtis Painter throwing the rock last night?  Seemed to have eyes only for Garcon.  If IND isn't going for Garrard or another FA/trade, look for Garcon to be a filler while Painter is the man behind center.  
  
**Sidney Rice** - Some crazy people may have dropped him.  He does not belong on the waiver wire.  If you're lucky enough to be able to get him, do it now - no more explanation needed.  
  
  

**RB**  
  
**Kendall Hunter** - Frank Gore hurt his ankle.  This guy might have his opportunity to shine.  Buyer beware with a rookie RB, but if Gore takes any time off, then you can look for him to have little to no competition in SF's backfield.  
  
**Stevan Ridley** - Preseason superstar who seems to be getting more snaps with the steady decline of the lawfirm, BenJarvus Green-Ellis, himself.  Don't expect ANYONE to be the 'feature back' for NE, but with the loose midfield boxes Brady creates, look for any RB with carries to be successful for NE.  
  
**James Casey** - BONUS - this guy is listed as RB/TE in Yahoo.  He has taken over Vonta Leach's role as FB for Houston, but seems to be one of those ""swiss army"" type utility guys.  This is a deep reach, but people may be in need of his services.  
  
**Isaac Redman** - Mendenhall touched the ball over 370 times last year.  Historically, this is a huge warning flag.  Last night we saw some unsuccessful carries from both Mendenhall and Redman.  Redman is rosterable in 12team+ deep leagues, though.  
  
**Lance Ball** - For some reason, Moreno didn't seem to be getting any snaps despite being fully dressed for action.  If anyone expects McGahee to withstand 20+ carries a game, they are terribly mistaken.  Ball runs with urgency and hits the hole hard on a John Fox coached team.  
  
**Earnest Graham** - PPR ONLY.  He seems to be the Bucs' 3rd down back.  He gets a bunch of checkdowns, and seems to be good for double digits every week for ppr formats.  
  
  
**TE**  
  
**Brandon Pettigrew** - If anyone was foolish enough to drop him, scoop him up.  For warnings, scroll up and read Titus young.  
  
**Heath Miller** - Boy has Hines Ward disappeared.  Heath had a couple of great grabs, look for him in deeper leagues.  
  
**Ed Dickson** - Sure, he's no Todd Heap, but Flacco likes to throw his way.  Question marks everywhere with new emergence of Torrey Smith.  
  
**Anthony Fasano** - He has to be worth a look here in deeper formats.  Eventually Sparano will have Henne stop throwing at triple covered Marshall so much, right?  Eh, probably not - but you might desperately need a deep TE pickup.  
  
  
Still avoiding: Early Doucet, Brandon Gibson, Doug Baldwin, Dane Sanzenbacher, Josh Cribbs, Andre Caldwell, Devin Hester, Kevin Walter, and Randall Cobb.  (A few of these guys are actually valuable in return yardage leagues).

1358239645.0,127,self.fantasyfootball,16ly74,This is a fantasy league format I thought some of you guys might like. Our season ends with the Super Bowl.,166,39,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/16ly74/this_is_a_fantasy_league_format_i_thought_some_of/,"I play in a $125 per man 14 team league. We play a 16 week regular season. We then play an eight team playoff that takes place during the actual NFL playoffs. This is my second year in the league. I haven't noticed anyone in this sub having a league like this so I thought I'd share. Here are the details if you care to read.

Regular Season:
The regular season is divided into two eight week sessions of head to head play. We draft before week 1 and play out the first eight weeks. The winner and second place clinch playoff spots and 1st through 4th get paid. Then we redraft before week 9 and everyone starts with a 0-0 record. Play out weeks 9-16 and the winner and second place of session 2 again clinch a playoff spot (if different from session 1) and 1st through 4th get paid out again. The combined records of the two sessions determine playoff seeding with the top eight teams making the playoffs. If a team clinched a spot but does not finish in the top eight overall they jump the lowest ranked team. 

Playoff Draft:
Before the first round of the NFL playoffs we have a 13 round draft. Draft order is determined by seeding with the best overall regular season team going first in each round, followed by 2nd going 2nd in each round, and so on. This draft format is the major incentive for performing well in the regular season, aside from winning money. A starting lineup consists of four team players (QB, kicker, defense, and/or head coach) and four individual players (RB, WR, and/or TE). A team QB or kicker means that you get the position's points regardless of who plays the position for that team; for instance I have Baltimore QB but if Flacco gets hurt I continue getting points from his backup. The head coach gets you 15 points for a win and 0 for a loss. You can have any combination of team and individual players in your starting lineup as long as there is four of each.

Playoffs:
Teams are not matched up head to head, instead the bottom two scoring teams are eliminated after the wild card round. Now with six teams left, each team can steal two players from the teams that were eliminated in a two round snake draft, the top scoring team gets to pick his draft position first, then the 2nd, yada yada yada. This replenishes your team since many of your players may have been eliminated from the NFL playoffs. If you drafted well, you should have several players on bye week teams but you also need to focus on solid wild card round players to make sure you advance. In the divisional round, again the bottom two teams are knocked out and again there is a two round snake draft where you can steal players from the four teams that have been eliminated. Same thing happens in the conference title round, the only difference being now you can have any eight players, team or individual, in your starting lineup (if you even have eight available). By the Super Bowl there are two teams remaining that play head to head. These teams likely won't have 8 players available to start but you play who you have left meaning an owner that managed his player selection well could have more players than his opponent. The winner gets a big payout and 2nd, 3rd, and 4th get paid as well.

This format extends the fantasy season and makes the NFL playoffs way more exciting. We use espn.com for the regular season but the commissioner keeps track of the overall records and point totals manually, also after the second draft he has to change everyone's roster. During the playoffs the commissioner keeps score manually and sends out a text with everyone's score after each game. During the regular season we don't allow trades but we do have a waiver wire that costs $5 per transaction.

1364303789.0,120,self.fantasyfootball,1b1f8m,A better scoring system for kickers?,132,12,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1b1f8m/a_better_scoring_system_for_kickers/,"I’ve always hated the role kicker’s play in most leagues.  They’re always drafted last or close to last.  They’re the position most likely to be swapped week to week.  But worst of all, they are extremely unpredictable.  This leads to too much randomness for my liking. One week a kicker will score 1 point, then the next week 20, then the next week 6 and so on.


There’s been a few leagues that I’ve seen that just eliminates kickers all together, but I think that’s a bit too extreme.  After all, kicking IS part of the game and needs to be accounted for somehow.  The question is what is the best fantasy approach to this?  How can we tame those huge random swings that a kicker adds to matchups?


Here is a picture of the top 13 kickers form last year in a standard scoring format (3 points for &lt;39, 4 for 40-49, 5 for 50+, 1 for XP, -1 for any miss).  It shows just how crazy the scoring is.
(It was supposed to be just the top 12 but then I saw that Seabass was #13 so I had to include him)
(I’ll show scoring in the x,x,x,x,x format from now on for ease of viewing.  This chart would then be “3,4,5,1,-1”)


http://i.imgur.com/QcmsVuJ.png

Average weekly score: 9.07

Standard Deviation: 4.34


Now here are some scoring options I’ve been playing with.  The main thing I think I have to do is reduce field goal values from 3 to something lower.  This is already done with QBs (throwing TDs count as 4 instead of 6) and it makes sense to do for kickers as well.  I’d like any system that has averages around 7 points and keeps the standard deviation below 3.


Option 1:  A kick is a kick is a kick.

Scoring: 1,1,1,1,-1

http://i.imgur.com/mvdY4QN.png

Average: 4.25

StdDev: 1.77

Pros:  It evens out the scoring pretty nicely, not many 0 scoring weeks, never more than 9 points scored.

Cons: It’s maybe too even, average too low


Option 2A: The bonus system.  Only hard to make kicks get scored.

Scoring: 0,1,3,0,-1 

http://i.imgur.com/pKeSv9m.png

Average: 0.93

StdDev: 1.79

Pros:  Even scoring

Cons: Too many 0 or less scoring weeks, average too low.



Option 2B: The bonus system with XPs.  Only hard to make kicks get scored as well as XPs.

Scoring: 0,1,3,1,-1

http://i.imgur.com/sstPOpN.png

Average: 3.59

StdDev: 2.10

Pros:  Even scoring

Cons: Does it put too much importance on long field goals?  Average still too low.


Option 3: Only XPs get counted.  This puts kickers right in line with team success

Scoring: 0,0,0,2,-1

http://i.imgur.com/3IykCeQ.png

Average: 5.00 

StdDev: 3.11

Pros: The scoring is in the range I want

Cons: It’s still a bit random and there’s just something wrong about not counting FGs


Option 4A: Reduced scoring #1

Scoring: 1,2,3,1,-1

http://i.imgur.com/aRmYIkd.png

Average: 5.26

StdDev: 2.33

Pros: Good range of values without being too high or low, even scoring

Cons: Average scores are a little low, maybe a little too even?


Option 4B: Reduced scoring #2

Scoring: 2,3,4,1,-1

http://i.imgur.com/97M7uLV.png

Average: 7.16

StdDev: 3.25

Pros: OK range of values without being too high or low, somewhat even scoring

Cons: Starting to get too inconsistent?


Option 4C: Reduced scoring #3

Scoring: 1,3,4,1,-1

http://i.imgur.com/92Jw2Sk.png

Average: 6.04

StdDev: 2.97

Pros: Good range of values without being too high or low, good even scoring

Cons: Average a bit too low?


Conclusion:

I like Options 1, 2B, and any 4. I think in the end I’m going to go with option 4C.  


30 yard field goals are practically chip shots for kickers today anyway so it makes sense that they be reduced.  (Sidenote; I remember reading something about how Bill Belichick wanted to make extra points harder to make.  I think the reasoning is that every play should count for something and that XPs were too routine).  I think option 4C still gives some randomness while maintaining a good consistent score week to week.

Of backs who carried the ball 250+ times last regular season, Foster ranked 10th out of 14 in yards-per-carry.

Guys tend to not come back well from 400+ carries. Shaun Alexander did it in 2005 and never rushed for 1000 yards again. Curtis Martin did it in 2004 and was out of the league by 2006. Terrell Davis survived the first time he did it, but suffered football death at 27 after his second 400+ carry season. Larry Johnson's career basically ended after his 416 carry REGULAR season in 2006. He rushed for 32 yards on 13 carries in the playoffs against one of the worst rush defenses that year and then was useless for the rest of his career.

Basically, don't draft Foster. He's already hurt. He's the most obvious bust of the season.

EDIT - STATS!

Since 1990, there have been 23 seasons of 400+ carry regular season + playoff carries.

Of those 23 seasons, only **31% followed up with top 10 fantasy seasons**.

Of those 23 seasons, the average Games Played the following year was just over 11.

Of those 23 seasons, the following seasons averaged UNDER 1,000 rushing yards.

EDIT 2 - I don't understand why people feel the need to downvote something the *don't agree with*. My post has generated discussion and I've been respectful. I didn't link to some shitty blog to get traffic to my website. I've made an argument about avoiding a player based on statistical trends and past NFL history. If you don't agree with me, that's fine. But downvoting just neuters discussion which should be the antithesis of what this subreddit is about.

If you want to have consensus opinion regurgitated to you, you can go look at [current ADP](http://fantasyfootballcalculator.com/adp.php)! Lookie there guys. Arian Foster is 3rd! Let's talk about how 3rd he is! 

EDIT 3 - I appreciate the discussion generated from this and I think I have a couple interesting new things to look at like how backs with 350-400 and 300-350 total touches to in following years. If there's a clear statistical trend upward as the carries go down, I think it would be an intriguing point. I thank you to those that didn't just downvote for disagreeing!

My problem with how this forum is now is the content.  In years past there was insightful advice, tips, breaking news, well reasoned start/sit opinions.  This year all I see is images of close wins, close loses, blowouts, stupid line up and of course 'memes'.  If you had a close win that's great, but tell us why you had close win, why did you start a certain player or sit a certain player, just don't gloat about a win, or a bitch about lose, analyze a little bit. 

Everybody who plays fantasy has these same close situations as you, the heartbreak, the joy.. you are not special.

It's fine that you want to be able to share your joy, but please, take it to YOUR LEAGUES message boards or if you bring here, make sure to analyze what happened a little so we can all learn from and become better.

r/FantasyFootball is no longer a resource that I use for making decisions because of the lack of actual, thought out, reasoned content.  I think it was in years past, and I hope it can be again.

Post links to good article you read, if your sitting a stud that you usually start, go ahead and tell us, and tell us why.  If you are starting a bench player that you usually sit, go ahead and let us know, and tell us why, so that other might also consider these moves.

After 3 weeks, many players are playing differently from their draft position. At some point, fantasy owners have to give up on their drafted player and make a trade or a waiver move to make their team better.

Some players, however, have just played poorly over the first few weeks, and they will rebound based on talent or matchups. 

I am lucky enough to have my team in my cash league doing well right now (3-0) so I'm looking for players worth buying now, and waiting for them to return to their potential, when they will become solid starters.

This year I decided to try out one of Yahoo's pro leagues.  It was a 20 dollar, 10 team league.  I thought it'd be fun and wasn't to much money.  Well I got off to a bad start this year.  I started 0-4 and decided it was time to make a move.  I make a public post to the entire league that I had Arian Foster up to sale for the top bidder.  Six or so teams sent me offers.  After negotiating for a few nights I finally finalized an offer with another owner. 

I was sending him Arian Foster, Jeremy Maclin and Jaquizz Rodgers.  In return I would get Adrian Peterson, Alfred Morris and Percy Harvin.  I was absolutely getting the better deal here and I loved it.  However, the other owner was going to benefit as well.  He had a very loaded team.  He was not starting Alfred Morris at all and was replacing Peterson with Foster an obvious upgrade, especially a few weeks back.  He was however downgrading from Percy to Maclin.  

Either way, it was a trade we both agreed to.  That should be the end of it.  The trade was protested by some pissed off owners and on Saturday night it was veto'd by Yahoo's commish office.  

As a result I did not have time to make any more trades and lost that week as well, when I would have won had that trade gone through.  

I emailed Yahoo multiple times.  Even citing their own rules that state they will NOT veto a trade unless it is obvious collusion.  They even mentioned it is not their job to stop owners from making unwise trades.  

Yet, for some reason they chose to veto my trade.  Further, they have not responded to a single inquiry I have made to them over the last few weeks.  Yet they somehow expect me to accept this and pay them my money?  


Absolutely not acceptable.  

I just want to make sure everyone on Reddit knows about this HORRIBLE service and to avoid playing any public or premium leagues on their site.

This draft program allows its user to use a traditional value based draft mindset but with the understanding of the value shift between rounds in a fantasy football draft. By utilizing the average draft pick for each player, the user is able to understand the decrease in projected points between players available in real time and those players who are projected to be available at the user's next pick. In doing so, each pick realizes the greatest value!

Please download and let me know what you think. I know this was helpful to some fellow users last year. I've updated a few things and included customizable scoring which can be used in PPR leagues.

Good luck!

1319748536.0,105,self.fantasyfootball,lre1g,Beginner's Fantasy Football guide,129,24,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/lre1g/beginners_fantasy_football_guide/,"I've seen a ton of simple questions spammed on this sub over the last few weeks, so I hope after reading this that number will go down.

1. Start your studs. You don't need to ask if you should start AP over DeMarco Murray. 99% of the time your stud will outperform any pickup you might have. I don't care if AP is facing the Ravens, first round guys like him find ways to be productive. If he doesn't find the yards he might find the end zone, that's already better than 80% of the wire.

2. Don't drop someone with a long track record of success unless you have concrete evidence of why they are performing poorly. You aren't dropping Rivers, he says he's healthy and he's been missing Gates for a while. He has a chance to come back, you can bench him for Andy Dalton if you want but don't drop him. You aren't dropping Chris Johnson either, I know he's been absolutely atrocious but chances are he will outperform Jackie Battle. There's no absolute evidence these guys can't bounce back, and unless you are in an 8 team league you should probably hold.

3. If you're deciding between 2 guys to pickup, ask yourself why you need them. Do you need a bye week fill-in? Or are you set and you need a bench warmer. If you need the bye week guy, go with the pickup who can produce now. That means you like Maurice Morris. If you want an end of the bench guy who might explode, you want Roy Helu (I know Mo'Mo isn't the best.. couldn't think of a better example right now). If you need the points always go for that first. There are only 16 weeks of football and every week is important.

4. Don't know who to drop for a hot pickup? Is it Sunday? No? Drop your kicker and let the information flow in before you decide. Your kicker won't be picked up by anyone, and even if they are - who cares. Kickers are random the majority of the time. 

5. Be patient. Players will have off weeks. But don't be naive - we're halfway through the season, if a player hasn't shown any glimpses it might be time to sell or cut bait. Again don't drop your studs, think about why they are struggling and decide if you think they will bounce back. You don't want to sell low, you want to do the opposite. Is your team really better if you deal Andre Johnson for Jordy Nelson at this point?

6. Identify your strengths and weaknesses. Are you too heavy at RB? If you have a [WDIS] Foster, McCoy, AP, FJax you should probably deal one for a WR instead. It's okay to sacrifice a little value if it improves your team a lot. I'd feel fine dealing FJax straight up for Mike Wallace if that means I didn't have to start James Jones anymore. Don't be the guy who has a stud on the bench every week.

7. Resources. Read up as much as you can, but don't take every word an analyst says to heart. Use the information and data they provide and come to your own conclusions. I remember everyone saying Gronkowski was the #1 TE for the ROS after the first 2 weeks and look what happened. Consider all the factors.

8. Don't take unnecessary risks. If you're sitting pretty in first place with a 7-0 record, don't trade Ahmad Bradshaw for Chris Johnson. Listen, I understand the allure of a ""sexy"" player like CJ but why risk the potential bust if you're already ahead. Sitting tight is probably the hardest part of fantasy football. At the same time if Ahmad is your 3rd/4th RB, do it.

9. Don't over manage your team. I'm guilty of this and the biggest problem is if you look at players long enough you will find (irrational) reasons to either love or hate them. Going back to the Ahmad Bradshaw for CJ trade, it might be easy to convince yourself after a while that Bradshaw is a for sure 'sell high'. His YTD production largely came from one game, and Brandon Jacobs is due back. He might get injured! Eli Manning just isn't that good of a QB. He hasn't had his bye week. Etc. Again, it's easy to rationalize if you bring yourself to hate a player enough. Think big picture. Your goal is to win the league, not to make trades. If you micromanage too much you'll find yourself stuck with a bunch of players you might have just bought high on.

**Edit: Can someone help get this in the sidebar? Some redditors suggested it.**

Last week's response to the Private Reddit Game was great, so I upped the ante and added an additional $50 to the prizepool and created another free game for this Sunday.

I also increased the number of entrants so everyone who wants to join can participate. Last week slobby took home the win: http://www.draftday.com/stats/nfl/39021/311781/Reddit-Game/

Here's directions:

* Those who haven't done so, signup and make a free account at [DraftDay](http://www.draftday.com/)
* Go to the NFL page and then select the ""Private"" filter
* Join the game (Game name is named after one of the NarFFL Commishes on this forum). 
* Password is ""AlexOnDD"" (case-sensitive) on Reddit.
* I'd appreciate an upvote to help keep this on the front-page and let other Redditors join in the fun

If you are struggling to get either the username or the password, feel free to **PM me here**. The trickier name/password is to ensure that the participants are all Redditors and to prevent Googlers from infiltrating OUR game.

For those unfamiliar, DraftDay is a Daily Fantasy Sports website where fantasy football games are contested over the course of a single week. We use the salary cap system for drafting teams. It's pretty self-explanatory, but if anyone has questions, please leave comment and I can help.

If anyone from last week wants to chime in and offer feedback on whether they liked/disliked the site, feel free to add a comment here.

I look forward to kicking all your butts!

Edit - You can see the scoring system by clicking the ""Rules"" tab at the top of the page when drafting a team.

P.S. - You can edit your roster at any time up until the game begins (Sunday 1p)

PPS - I've had a few requests about inviting friends. Tell anyone you'd like. If you use the ""My Referrals"" under your account, you can get a $10 bonus per referral.

PPPS - You should sign up for the Perfect Lineup too. Free contest, $1 Million Grand Prize and $390 in free prizes :)

I hope you're having a good one.
*******************

So, I'm in a league with a $500 prize and was fortunate enough to make it to my championship game. As of this morning, I'm down 4 points with Roddy White, Darren Sproles, Kahlil Bell, John Kasay, and Drew Brees remaining. My opponent has Pierre Thomas and Jimmy Graham.

Now, I got a call from my opponent and a text later from the commissioner telling me that I need to bench Drew Brees to ""make things fair"" since he played Tony *R'ohno* who scored a whopping 0.00 points. I was told that if I don't do it, the commissioner will do it for me. I live in a different state than these guys, but I wish I could fly back home and punch them in the face. Considering that I have 5 remaining players to my opponent's 2, I think I'd still win even without a quarterback, but that's not the point. 

I'm not asking you guys what to do here, but I am posting this just because of how fucked up it is. I have the most points of any team this season, drafted well and now am being punished for it.

If I do win this, QB or not, I'm going to brag my fucking ass off until the end of time. BTW, you guys rock and all of our advice this season has really helped! Thanks!

**TL;DR - My opponent and the league commissioner and trying to force me to bench Drew Brees since Tony Romo ""didn't play"" this week. The winner of the league gets $500.**
*******************
**Update:** Just to check in after the Sunday night game, Kahlil Bell really helped me out tonight. Either way, I haven't dealt much with the two other guys in the league because I was with my family all day celebrating the holiday. I thought of moving Brees to the bench until 1 min before tomorrow's game when I'll put him back in, just to piss these guys off. But I'm probably just going to ignore their cries and leave my lineup as is. Emailing league right now, too.

**2nd Update:** I got a text from my opponent tonight saying ""I told [the commissioner] you don't have to drop Brees. I was just pissed at Romo"". The text pissed me off because he's still implying that this was his decision and a justifiable one... Anyway, all is peaceful in the world again. I just won my first fantasy football league in a decade! I'm going to celebrate right now with some [Lagunitas IPA](http://i.imgur.com/eaLRY.png). Merry Christmas everyone and good night!

**Final Update:** I started Drew Brees and he killed it, as I'm sure you all know. Sproles, and even Roddy White, had good games, too. I won by a MASSIVE margin, bigger than any point total Tony Romo has put together this year. Assuming Romo hit his projected stats, I'd still have won. Victory is mine!

Pretty much the same as it has been all year, really. The Jets at the top, and... okay, so not at all like it's been all year. The Jets really do rank as the top team this week, though they share the top tier with Chicago, San Francisco, and Dallas. I would consider all four of those teams fairly even, although my formula does favor them as ranked.

I've broken the rankings down into tiers this week, to give a better idea of how much separates each team. Any of the teams in a given tier can be swapped with each other with minimal differences in expectation; after all, D/STs don't show as much separation between scoring as some of the skill positions do. Still though, if you're on the fence about a particular decision, the actual rankings would be my final determining factor.

Waiver wire stars Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Denver rate fairly low this week, although they're all strong enough plays that you can justify starting them this week if you can't roster a second D/ST. If you can though, look to bench them this week in favor of NY Jets, Dallas, Carolina, or Buffalo. Arizona, Baltimore, and Green Bay may also be available and worth picking up.

Overall, I expect this week to be a relatively low-scoring week for D/STs, barring an unusually high number of high variance defensive TDs.

I correctly encouraged you to stay away from Houston, although SF hit the variance jackpot and stomped all over New Orleans. I don't feel a bit of remorse for sitting them in favor of St Louis in the one league I had the choice.

Also, Seattle was a little disappointing, but going into the 4th quarter, they looked to have a pretty solid finish. Then, 10 points conceded later, they fell to a still-respectable 6 points.

So far I have it calculating points over average for likely draftees.  Additionally I want to incorporate position totals for your opponents so you can guess who they will draft next.  What would you want it to do?  I'm giving free copies to the subreddit once I'm done.

Edit:  Another question, what kind of information would you like to see about the players?  Age, injury weeks, touches, shoe size etc...

Edit 2:Does anyone have a good source for ADP info?  I know a few now but would like to average some together.

Edit 3:How about naming this thing?  FF Command Center?  The Draft Tool to end all Draft Tools?

Edit 4: I'm trying to process all this information and prioritize the features.  I think we have a couple of different things here.  One is a draft tool and the other is a data miner.  Initially I think I'm going to work on the draft tools while allowing for easy import of extra info like offensive line ranking, YAC, age, BMI etc etc.  This way I can get going on the actual tool while crowd sourcing the data portion.  Once I establish a structure for the import files all we have to do is share them.

I won't touch these players with a ten-foot-pole next year. Running down by this year's ESPN ADP list:

Chris Johnson - RB - TEN: ADP 8.4 | Nowhere near enough consistency to be considered an RB1. He'll hit some big home runs for you, but won't score enough points to be taken in the top 20 in a 10 team league... where he'll be going again next year.

Darren McFadden - RB - OAK: ADP 25.8 | Constantly injured, and ineffectual when healthy. Got completely showed up by Marcel Reece this year. I saw him go in the 1st round in some drafts.

Hakeem Nicks - WR - NYG: ADP 31.1 | One slot behind AJ Green and one ahead of Victor Cruz

Ryan Mathews - RB - SD: ADP 37.0 | It's not all Norv - this guy had more broken clavicles than TDs and that problem isn't going away with a coaching change.

Vernon Davis - TE - SF: ADP 50.0 | The way he disappears for weeks at a time will kill you. There are always more consistent options available later.

Antonio Gates - TE - SD: ADP 52.1 | He's no Tony Gonzalez. Age and injuries are taking a major toll, but it won't be properly reflected in draft position in 2013.

Jermichael Finley - TE - GB: ADP 62.1 | Having Aaron Rodgers' TE seems like a great idea, until you watch him drop more passes than he catches.

I won't go any further down the line, but other obvious candidates (from this ADP list) are the Ravens D/ST (81.1) and Mason Crosby (117.7)... why do people always take D/ST and kickers so high? I'll never get it.

- Vernon Davis - Minnesota's biggest strength defensively is their line.  They're weak in the secondary, but rank 4th against the run.  Look for Smith to throw a lot, and need to checkdown.

If this post ends up a little long, sorry in advance. It might deal with ideas that are a little more in-depth than most entry-level fantasy players are used to, but I feel like that makes this a good place to discuss it since everyone here seems to be pretty well on top of everything, as well as having good attention spans. If you're reading this post about fantasy football in early July, I'm guessing you're probably pretty experienced and savvy and will be able to stick with it.

So, to start, a couple of ideas/strategies that I see promoted fairly commonly around here: 

* The first is that this year, quarterback is an extremely deep position, and that you're better off waiting until the later rounds (5,6+) to get a quarterback that will be a good value. An Andrew Luck, Russel Wilson, Matthew Stafford type. Most people in this sub, I feel, wouldn't advocate drafting Aaron Rodgers in the first round, and many wouldn't advocate drafting him in subsequent rounds after that.

* The next idea is the concept of  **value-based drafting** (VBD). Laid out pretty well [here](http://www.footballguys.com/05vbdrevisited.htm), this draft strategy basically states that you try to get the best value possible with every pick you make. The goal is not to draft the player who will score the most total points, but to draft the player that will score the most points relative to his peers, thus giving you an advantage at as many positions as possible over your competition in the league. This philosophy seems pretty well-supported and prevalent around here, and is one that I'll probably always stick to.

Agreeing with both of the above strategies, I decided to take an early look at how players stack up value-wise. I've always been the type to lean toward running backs first, other positions later on, and was planning on trying to get an Andrew Luck type QB in a later round, preferably 7 or later. 

The start to any draft plan begins with projections, stats, and how you think each player will do during the year. While I always end up using my own rankings, I was curious to see what the results would be using what the experts are projecting, so I downloaded the consensus stat projections compiled from 7 different expert sources (CBS, ESPN, FFToday, Pro Football Focus, etc) at FantasyPros.com, [here](http://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/projections/qb.php) and used that as my data. Many people here often recommend this as a starting point as it's a nicely-balanced set of data from multiple experts.

Then, I put the data to use to calculate the value of each player. 

Rules I used:


* Standard scoring. Non-PPR, 6 points per rushing/receiving touchdown, 4 per passing touchdown, 10 yards/point rushing/receiving, 25 yards/point passing, -2 for INT's and fumbles.
* Positions: 1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 TE (I didn't include DEF/Kicker in this data evaluation)
* 14-person league (This means that the baseline numbers for VBD came from the 14th-ranked QB, 28th RB, 42nd WR, etc.)

In my evaluation, I used ADP data from Fantasyfootballcalculator.com, which can be found [here](http://fantasyfootballcalculator.com/adp.php).

[**The Result**](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0CDw6nnHAZ8bDEzRXRJYVVkb1k/edit?usp=sharing)

What I saw honestly surprised me. Everyone knows Aaron Rodgers will score a massive amount of points, but the consensus seems to be that there are many more valuable players (namely running backs) that should be drafted long before he is. Yet there he sits, the third most valuable player overall. Brees is right behind him at 6, with Peyton Manning at 11 and Cam Newton at 14. That means that, based on value and gaining a leg up on peers, 4 quarterbacks should really go in the first round of this draft.

Upon comparing that to their ADP, I was pretty shocked to learn that meant that Rodgers is being drafted 17 spots (more than an entire round) below his value, Brees is being drafted 20 (two full rounds in many leagues) spots below his, and Peyton and Cam are being drafted 24 and 34 spots respectively (2-3 rounds) below their actual value. 

Upon examining the data further, it seems that nearly every quarterback is pretty significantly undervalued, and that many of the mid-tier and later running backs are being significantly overvalued. Additionally, the scoring settings I used were, if anything, a little harsher on QB's than many leagues are, using 4 points per passing touchdown rather than 6. Had I used 6, the discrepancies between value and ADP would likely be even further skewed.

I'm honestly extremely perplexed by what I've found. I've gone back through my math and formulas to attempt to find somewhere where I made a mistake, but I can find none. If this data holds up, I may re-evaluate my draft strategy to go for a Cam Newton/Tom Brady-type in the 4th/5th.

**Can anyone explain this? Why are quarterbacks so extremely undervalued this year? Can you see anything I did wrong that could have possibly skewed the data? Any other thoughts, explanations, or advice? Feel free to chime in with whatever thoughts cross your mind; I'd love to get to the bottom of this.**

Hello! :)

First, I hope you started Seattle rather than played against them. My so-called ""best play of the year so far"" delivered with the best score of the year so far. Not bad!

3. St. Louis

7. Green Bay
8. Oakland
9. Cincinnati
10. Tennessee

30. San Francisco

Off the board: Cleveland and Washington

It's in the home stretch now. I squeaked by in my semifinal matchup starting San Francisco (and with Russell Wilson's dud!), but there's no way in hell I'll be starting the 49ers this week. I repeat, **starting San Francisco is begging for negative points this week**. It's the same pattern we've been seeing with Houston last week and pretty much every D/ST opposing New England or New Orleans.

As for the top of the rankings, Miami occupies the first spot this week. That should be no surprise, they're a decent unit facing a terrible offense at home. They've been my week 15 target for a couple months now, and they should deliver.

The surprise to me, though, is Washington. However, it shouldn't be: Washington is most vulnerable in the air, and Cleveland's passing attack is lackluster. Washington will be at home, moderately favored (even with RGIII out), and the game likely will be low scoring.

**Edit: Washington is on the road. I assumed with the spread at -6.5 that they must be at home. Wowzer! Their ranking is even more of a head-scratcher, but I'm not willing to write it off just yet.**

**Tier 1**: Miami

**Tier 2**: St. Louis, Detroit, Seattle, Houston, Green Bay

**Tier 3**: Oakland, Cincinnati, Tennessee, New England, Minnesota, San Diego, NYJ, Pittsburgh, Denver, Chicago

Everyone rated below Chicago can be comfortably sat in all leagues. Anyone in tier 3 can be comfortably sat in most leagues.

**YTD Analysis**

I struggled with a way to determine just how useful these rankings have been. However, I think the following should suffice. I compared how each ranking performed over the year. For example, the teams ranked #1 averaged 12.17 points per game. The #2 teams averaged 9.92 points per game, and so on. For reference, the #1 team (Chicago) has averaged 13.1 points per game.

The next list is the points per game for each rank compared to the team that actually occupies that rank. The percentage is what I'm calling an ""Efficiency rating"" which is a ratio between the two

Ranking | Actual | Efficiency%

1. 12.17 (13.1) - 92.90%

2. 9.92 (11.2) - 88.57%

3. 8.92 (10.4) - 85.77%

4. 5.08 (10.1) - 50.30%

5. 9.75 (9.6) - 101.56%

6. 11.42 (9.5) - 120.21%

7. 12.75 (8.5) - 134.21%

8. 9.5 (8.5) - 111.76%

9. 6.92 (8.2) - 84.39%

10. 9.33 (7.9) - 118.10%

11. 7.67 (7.8) - 98.33%

12. 9.83 (7.8) - 126.03%

13. 5.58 (7.5) - 74.40%

14. 4.5 (7.4) - 60.81%

15. 5.91 (7.2) - 82.08%

16. 6.09 (7.1) - 85.77%

So, my #7 ranked teams from week-to-week, collectively, have averaged 12.75 points - 134% more than the 7th ranked D/ST, San Diego (avg of 9.5 points).

Also, the projected top 12 week-to-week, overall, were at a 99.7% ""efficiency"" - they scored, collectively, 4 fewer points than the actual 12 best teams have.

My first thought was that perhaps, all of the strongest ""stud"" D/STs were bringing up these averages, so I went through week-by-week and tallied them all up.

No. 1s: Chicago x2, Baltimore, Miami, SF x3, GB, Houston, Denver, NYJ, Seattle

No. 2s: SF x2, Dallas, Houston, TB, Minnesota, Chicago x2, SD, Seattle x2, Atlanta

No. 3s: Dallas, Arizona x3, NYG, GB x2, Seattle, Pittsburgh, SF x2, Cleveland

No. 4s: GB, Seattle, Arizona, STL x2, New England, Minnesota, Houston, Miami, Carolina, Dallas, Chicago

No. 5s: NYJ, Houston, Cincinnati, Baltimore x2, Chicago, New England, Atlanta, Dallas, STL, GB, Denver

No. 6s: Philadelphia, SF x2, Atlanta, Oakland, NYJ x2, Chicago x2, Denver, Pittsburgh, Carolina

No. 7s: Buffalo x2, STL x2, NYJ x2, Houston x2, Miami x2, Cincinnati x2, Baltimore

No. 8s: Houston, Chicago x2, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Kansas City, New England, Cleveland, Arizona, Buffalo

Phew. Most teams are represented there at least once. **If I told you before the season started that streaming a combination of the Bills, Rams, Jets, Dolphins, Bengals (and Baltimore plus Houston) would score you 12.75 points per game**, would you have believed me?

1345566850.0,94,self.fantasyfootball,yl4zu,Announcement: New Posting Rules and Guidelines for 2012. ,116,22,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/yl4zu/announcement_new_posting_rules_and_guidelines_for/,"Greetings /r/fantasyfootball.           

After some discussion with the moderators we've decided to try some new things out this year. Laid out below you'll find our rules, guidelines, and FAQ for the 2012 season. This will be evolving as the season moves on and we are still kicking around a few other ideas such as weekly threads for Waiver Wire pickups and discussing your team's weekly results. We may also be adding other features such as link flair down the road. We will have this information posted to the sidebar shortly (though not in as much detail) so that they can remain visible for new and existing subscribers of /r/fantasyfootball.   

These rules and guidelines will go into effect immediately. However, existing posts will not be removed and users will not be punished for them. We want /r/fantasyfootball to be filled with discussions, advice, and helpful users rather than fall into the Reddit trap of cheap memes and one-liners. That is why these changes are being made prior to the start of the 2012 season. But If we find that some things aren't working, we will review the ideas and adjust them as necessary. Now, onto the changes.     

     
*Posting Rules* - Please familiarize yourself with these rules. Failure to abide can result in a warning from the mods, posts being removed, and potentially being banned from the subreddit.          

**1 - No memes and only *relevant* image posts**. (Note: videos will also fall under this rule)         
Yes, memes can be funny, but they really do not add anything substantial to the subreddit. There are good reasons to post images, if you're not sure if your image is acceptable, it probably isn't. For now, images of league trophies, team logos/names, etc will be allowed as they can generate positive discussion. But if we find that these posts lead to negative/off-topic discussion they may be removed and potentially elimated. Please see the examples below:        

&gt;examples of acceptable image posts: Your roster after your draft. Related screenshots when asking about a trade, waiver wire, or general feedback. A picture of a trade proposal. A picture of your league trophy (pro tip: for trophies please provide background on the trophy, how it was made, where you purchased it, etc to generate discussion).     

.

&gt; examples of unacceptable image posts: Any memes. A picture of a player with a caption like ""THIS GUY"". A screenshot of your 1 point victory or loss. A screenshot of ""poor decision"" in your league or poor advice. A picture of you and Matthew Berry giving a thumbs up.        

**2 - No trolling/baiting/harassment etc.**              
Just don't do it. At best you'll have your post removed and get a warning from the mods, but repeat offenders and extreme cases can result in you being banned. Follow Reddiquette and you'll have no problem.            

**3 - No inane/off-topic posts.**            
There's no need to post an entire thread about the spelling of a player's name or obscure factoids regarding rosters. Please try and keep things relevant to fantasy football.               

**4 - Do not post links for streams**               
Games are available for free over the air, at your local sports bar, at NBC.com for Sunday Night Football, and with NFL Gamepass.        

____________________________________________________________             

        
**Posting Guidelines** - These are not rules and you will not be banned for not following these. However, it is strongly 

encouraged that you follow these guidelines as a courtesy to everyone else.             

**1 - *PLEASE* post your league rules and information.** Standard scoring? PPR? 6pt passing TDs? 10 teams or 14 teams? I promise you will receive better advice if you include this information with your post. If you don't include this in your post, 9 times out of 10, one of the first responses you get will request it anyway, so save yourself the time and post it right off the bat.        

**2 - Please use the following tags** to identify what the type of submission you're posting.       

* Rate my team - use tag [RMT] before title of post.      

&gt;ex: [RMT] Please rate my mock draft.          

* Review this trade - use tag [Trade] before title of post. Also clearly state give/get in title.        

&gt;ex: [Trade] Give Ray Rice / Get Ryan Leaf             

* Who do I start? - use tag [WDIS] before title of post. Post names of players being considered in title.         

&gt;ex: [WDIS] Peyton Manning or Eli Manning               

* Waiver Wire - use tag [WW] before title of post. Say who you are thinking of picking up and dropping in the title.           

&gt;ex: [WW] Drop Kevin Kolb for Mcnabb?            

* Keepers - use tag [KEEPER]. Explain the rules of the keeper league. Do you have to give up a draft pick? How many keepers do you get? Etc.                

&gt;ex: [KEEPER] Keep Ray Rice or Lesean McCoy? No draft picks relinquished.         

* Open Leagues - use tag [OL] before title of post. Say how many spots are available in your league, type of league, and if it requires payment.      

&gt;ex: [OL] 2 Spots in 14 Team H2H League. $10 buy-in required.       

**3 - Be thoughtful when replying.** Do not simply post ""You're weak at WR."" or ""I wouldn't draft Peterson."" Explain why you think they are weak at WR, offer ways they can improve their team. Why wouldn't you draft Peterson, who do you suggest instead?  
  
     
**4 - When posting breaking news, please view [NEW](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/new/) posts first.** Obviously, this is so we avoid having 5+ posts every time a player tears an ACL.             

**5 - Try the search function first.** While it's always good to revisit certain discussions, much can be found in old posts. This can especially for Commisioners looking for advance on how to handle a variety of situations. If your question was last discussed 6 months ago, go ahead and post it again. If your question was last discussed 6 days ago, you'll probably be fine reading the previous submission.           

**6 - Help us help you.** We can't keep an eye on every single post and comment in the subreddit 24/7. Don't hesitate to contact the moderators. If you see someone violating rules, spamming, find that sumbitted content is subpar, etc let us know. That's what we're here for.     

________________________________

**FAQ**        

**Can I link to my website/blog/tool?**       

Yes, we will allow the community to decide whether or not your link is popular by upvoting or downvoting your submission. If we notice an unreasonable amount of posting (ie spam), we will notify you and it could lead to a potential ban. You're also encouraged to try /r/sportsblogs.           

**Can X be sticked on the sidebar?**          

Maybe. Post it to /r/fantasyfootball. If there is overwhelming support for the guide, website, or whatever, then there is a possibility it could be sticked.     
       
**Why isn't my post isn't showing up?**        

It could have just been caught in a filter, message a mod to look into it.       

**Why was my post removed?**         

In all likelihood your post either violated a rule or was a duplicate to another active discussion (ie Player X was just injured). Message a mod if you think it may have been removed in error.

My desire to talk to a group of people that wouldn’t think less of me when a want to discuss the potential fantasy value of Wes Welker in February brought me to Reddit a few weeks ago. It is comforting to know that I am not the only person desperately seeking the exchange of fantasy insight in March like Nick Nolte seeks a case of Natty Light. The opinions and comments on the football postings are both informed and entertaining. 

So I ventured off the fantasy football page to look at some of the postings on the other main sections. I stumbled upon a posting from a father of his handicapped child that was able to walk for the first time at the age of 6 with the assistance of walking device, heartwarming positive message on the web in a world of focused tragedy and sadness. This story was disliked by almost of half of the people who viewed it. If that wasn’t bad enough, some of the hateful, ignorant, comments directed towards the father and even the kid were sick.

I just wanted to thank everyone that I have come across in this subreddit so far for being not only being knowledgeable and insightful to posts, but for simply being respectable human beings. Much of Reddit seems to be doing it wrong. Thanks again.

[The Master List - OpenOffice format](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13670504/The%20Master%20List.ods)

###UPDATE!

The link above has been updated with a new version of the spreadsheet. This version should resolve the ""small screen"" issue some of you were having. If you're still having issues with this version, let me know!

I've also added a download link for a "".pdf"" version of this file. I should have a "".ods"" up in a second or two, so hang tight.

I can't export the original workbook as a "".csv"" file as some have requested, since it doesn't support multiple worksheets. Try the "".ods"" or, if you're just looking to print it, the "".pdf"" file.

###Notes!

If you have Excel, I would recommend downloading the Excel version over the other two. It preserves all of the formatting and works great for on-screen viewing or printing.

If you just want to print it, or don't have Excel or OpenOffice, download the PDF. I've already formatted it to fit onto a standard, letter-sized sheet of paper, so all you have to do is hit ""Print"" and you're good to go.

If you're having trouble with the Excel version, and have OpenOffice, try downloading the OpenOffice format. You lose the conditional formatting, but all the data is still there.

As we all know everyone is preparing and drafting for fantasy football this time of year. Our little subreddit starts to see a huge spike in traffic every August, and in particular we always see a *very large* increase in posts asking for draft and team feedback.   

These posts aren't popular with everyone, but luckily we have a large enough community that most people get some kind of feedback. Nevertheless, the volume in posts is very high and can be a little distracting to those looking for news and other discussions. Not only that, but we've noticed that many posts are mass downvoted in an effort to make another post more visible. In an effort to discourage that kind of behavior, and clean up the things in general, we are implementing these two extra rules effective immediately.   

1. [RMT] and [KEEPER] posts are for **feedback** and **advice**, not for bragging. If your post is simply to boast, it will be toast. And by that of course, we mean it will be removed. If you're an ""expert"" at fantasy football we'd appreciate it if you helped others, rather than brag about how you drafted CJ Spiller *and* Marshawn Lynch.    

2. You **must** include information on your league settings. Leading up to the season, [RMT] and [KEEPER] posts that do not include league setting information will be removed. You don't have to give us *every* setting; it can be as simple as saying ""standard scoring"" or "".5 PPR"" or ""2 QB"". The community is pretty good at self enforcing this, but we are going to go the extra step and make it official.    


""How can I help?"", you ask. Well, the mods can't be everywhere at once. If you see a post that violates one of these rules, **politely** request the missing information or click the report button and one of the mods will take a look at it ASAP.   

We'll be making another big post in a week or so with the complete 2013 Rules and Guidelines, but because draft season is in full swing we thought it would be best to announce this now. Stay tuned for the next big post and thank you to everyone for making this place great.

Some things I just want to put out there. ,89,5,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/km62g/been_playing_ff_since_1994_some_things_i_just/,"Based on some posts comments i've read, i just wanted to throw out my 2 cents. I have been in 2 money leagues since 1994 and run ten teams on ESPN for pay. I am not an expert but I am not pretending to be. No projections here. 

Certain players have ""earned"" the right not to be judged on a 2 game scale. In other words, if a player has been a consistent performer and not much has changed regarding their team, health, etc. then don't write them off yet. Players in this category : Finley, Roddy W, Gates, CJ2K, D-Jax, Williams (TB). 

Rookie RB's usually slow down. 

Don't think of your team as different units. In other words don't dismantle a stable of stud WR's because your RB's are weak. Your team is a cohesive unit and points come from all angles. Your RB's may be weak but is your whole team really improving when you trade a stud WR for 2 mediocre rbs. Do the math 1st because often times your team will look better on paper but not in points scored. 

Don't panic. Save panic mode for Week 5. This is week 2. Have confidence in your picks. Some guys will continue to suck but there are not many players who are sucking right now that you can confidently say will suck all year. On the flip side there aren't too many ""out of no where"" big scorers that you can confidently say will continue this pace all year. 

Think of players as stocks. Buy low and sell high. Move Hightower now. Go try and get Finley. 

CONSTANTLY offer trades to struggling teams. You never know when frustration may give way to sheer stupidity. If you are the struggling owner, don't get stupid. You are nowhere close to mathematically eliminated from anything and at worse you are 2 games out of first. 

Again, i am not an expert and thats why I haven't told you, unsolicited, who to go get or who will get hot, etc. I'm just trying to remind folks its a long year. Don't trade away underperforming stars for players who are hot right now. Not yet.

I like to think I have a pretty good amount of knowledge about my team, but obvious things like injuries I assumed would be widely known, but apparently they aren't.  I see questions on here left and right asking what is wrong with the Bears D, and I give the same answer every time and nobody seems to have any clue that this is happening, but injuries have killed the Bears defense these past few weeks.  Let me just give you a list of guys that the Bears are and have been missing.

Henry Melton - was injured Sunday.  This isn't the first time he's been injured this season and the Bears have plenty of DT's who can take his place (Nate Collins has been playing very well so far).  Still, he was headed to the Pro Bowl (may still be) and any time you lose a Pro Bowler it hurts.

Brian Urlacher - The heart and soul of this Bears defense for the past decade, losing Urlacher is a huge loss for this Bears team, similar to Baltimore's D losing Ray Lewis.

Tim Jennings - Got hurt Week 13 about halfway through the game.  Jennings is another breakout star the Bears have found this season and he too is likely headed to the Pro Bowl.  Jennings has been ball hawking all season and without him on the field, it is much easier for teams to avoid Charles Tillman because Hayden is not nearly as good as Jennings is.

Look elsewhere for Week 15 against the Packers (Miami or Detroit should be your ideal choices) but hold onto them for Week 16 against Arizona and Week 17 if necessary, as Jennings and Urlacher will likely both be back, possibly Melton as well depending on the severity of his injury. 

EDIT: I didn't think this was too big of a deal initially posting but after giving it some more thought I'm also going to add McClellin to this list of important injuries.  Without McClellin and Melton the Bears defensive line rotation is missing a lot of snaps.  Although the Bears have a lot of depth they use that depth wisely and it keeps their defensive line fresh throughout all 60 minutes, missing two of those players will hurt the Bears defensive line later in games, leading to extra late game scores.

EDIT 2: To go along with my post about the Bears injuries (what timing right...fuck) the Bears cancelled practice today because of injuries.  That's right, the Bears are so banged up that they can't even practice for the goddamn Packers

I have gone through the WDIS threads many times helping my fellow FF enthusiasts. I have stopped doing it as much recently for a few reasons

1) You rarely receive upvotes, and even sometimes am receiving DOWNVOTES. My FF opinion is fairly informed, but not perfect. I can definitely understand disagreement as FF pre-rankings are not always correct. However, to receive downvotes in threads where there are hundreds, sometimes thousands, of questions and few people answering is simply ridiculous. Replying to my answer and providing a valid disagreement is perfectly fine BTW.

2) I do receive thank you's, but they are few and far between. I have had people save my username and PM me questions during the week. I am 100% glad to go out of my way to give you my opinion on a tough FF question. However, when its just a single line of text over and over, with no thank you, it starts to feel like a 2nd job than something enjoyable.

I tried fantasyknuckleheads which promised a high level of customization ability.  I couldn't see much with the screenshots, but thought, what the hell, its $25.

I was highly disappointed once I registered, and within ten minutes emailed the owner asking if I could cancel my subscription, that unfortunately his product did not match what I was looking for.  I got a response back that was not only unprofessional, but downright rude.  ""Sorry Bro, I am not Walmart.  All sales are final.""  While that annoyed me, I tried again to be polite and ask for a refund.  The next response was ""Sorry dude, I am like a fruit stand, you can't take a bit and then give it back.""  Horrible customer service bothers me, so I thought I would share with you guys and gals in hopes that this would reflect poorly on him and you would avoid his service.  Ended up really liking Rotowire after a bit more research.

TL:DR - fantasyknuckleheads are dicks, and their product sucks.

Do yourself a favor and avoid Foster. His ypc dropped to a pedestrian 4.1 this year. He's currently gotten 383 carries so far this season and, barring an injury, he's almost certainly going to go over 400 next week.

Bust Candidate #1.

I anticipate a lot of hate for this so oh well....Jamal Lewis, Larry Johnson, Jamal Anderson, Shaun Alexander, Ahman Green, Earl Campbell, MJD, Edgerrin James etc. etc etc etc etc. Seriously, you should be mad at Kubiak's blatant misuse of Foster, not the messenger!

I also anticipate the names LT, Emmitt Smith, and Eric Dickerson to be brought up as counter points. So if you think Foster is one of the 5 or 6 best backs in NFL history...by all means draft him again. Otherwise...

Alright, what did Muscle Hamster's season look like last year?

That was good for 262 points in Yahoo default scoring (including one lost fumble for -2 points). Obviously we can't completely take out the Raiders game (#8), since the dude wasn't injured or anything. It was just a great game where the Bucs heavily leaned on Martin. So what I did instead was to figure out his average game *without* the Raiders game, then replace the Raiders game with that average game. That normal Muscle Hamster game looks like this:

 Ru Att | Ru Yds | Ru TDs | Rec | Rec Yds | Rec TD
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
20|80|0.5|3|30|0.1

Now, I rounded up that half TD to one TD. With that game plugged in for game 8, his season totals were:

 Ru Att | Ru Yds | Ru TDs | Rec | Rec Yds | Rec TD
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
314|1283|8|48|481|1

That's good for a total of 226 points again using Yahoo default scoring if we keep the lost fumble, which I'm going to do because I'm too lazy to figure out whether or not it was in game 8. 

This drops him from the 2nd ranked RB, between AP and Foster, to the 6th ranked RB, between Morris and Rice. With an improved offensive line (line play matters a lot more to running efficiency than most people think, just like quarterback play actually matters a lot more to pass protection) and the addition of Revis to their secondary (the main problem with Martin's inconsistency/low games was when they abandoned the run to try to catch up/keep up - see games 4 and 14 above for good examples). In games where the Bucs won, Martin averaged 23 carries and almost 5.6 YPC. When they lost, he averaged 17 carries and 3.4 YPC. 

Most importantly with this perspective, I tend to think that the guys who are ahead of him in this ""new"" ranking will regress this season (with the exception of AP). The Skins are probably going to lean a bit more heavily on their passing game this year and at the same time limit RG3 in the running game, which was a big reason for Morris' success last year. Ray Rice looks to have a good portion of his carries taken by Pierce. Lynch is in the same situation as Morris with a successful young quarterback looking to take snaps away from the running game. Foster's YPC keeps dropping, and yet I can't see him possibly getting more than 351 carries this season. All in all, I think there's a good case that Martin is at least going to have a solid 2013, with huge upside to go along with it.

For instance, last night the Sunday night game was the Chargers at the Saints.  I for one didn't care about this game at all.  But in one of my matchups I was up 74-71 with his Darren Sproles left.  I thought I was for sure toast.  This was going to be an intense game if only for the fact that we were both previously 4-0 and in the same division.  

I was glued to the TV all night.  Every time the Saints had the ball my stomach was in knots waiting for Darren Sproles to break the big one as he usually does.  It finally came down to the fourth quarter and the Saints were driving.  

Sproles was sitting at 2 points for the night (we don't do fractional in this league) and needed either 4 more rushing yards or 2 receiving just to tie.  They gave him the ball and he rushed for three yards. Then, in the red zone, on third down Brees looked for Sproles who was wide open and waltzed in for the score...or would have if it was not for a Charger lineman (Legent I believe) tipping the ball at the line.  This tip saved me from losing and it caused me great joy.  

Now say what you will but this reason alone makes fantasy football worth it to me.  I enjoy almost every game now instead of just the Packers (which haven't been the best this year).

'Twas the night before Football, when all through the house

Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;

The rosters were set by the managers with care,

In hopes that a victory would soon would be there;

The meatheads were nestled all snug in their beds,

While visions of touchdowns danced in their heads;

And fans in their jerseys, and I in my cap,

Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,

When out on the field there arose such a clatter,

I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.

Away to the TV I flew like a flash,

Turned on NFL Redzone and sat on my ass.

The sky-cam on the face of the new-fallen player

My defense just sacked him, my opponent has not a prayer

When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,

But a touchdown reception, as I sip from my beer,

With a little old receiver, so lively and quick,

I knew in a moment it must be Hakeem Nicks.

More rapid than The Eagles when McCoy gets the ball,

I whistled, and shouted, and called on them all;

""Now, Dwayne Bowe! now, Matt Schaub! now, Hernandez and Shonn Greene!

On, Hey-Bey! on Battle! on, Mcgahee and A.J. Green!

To the top of this week's points! to the top of the standings!

Now get 100 yards! 100 yards! In bonus points I'll be landing!""

... (At this point I realized this was longer than I remembered and decided to skip to the end)

...But I heard them exclaim, ere as they walked out of sight,

""Happy fantasy Sunday to all, and to all a good fight!""",,False,,t5_2qlqq,False,,,True,t3_m28ga,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/m28ga/twas_the_night_before_football/,

Here are the week 16 rankings.

1. Chicago
2. Denver
3. Green Bay
4. Houston
5. New England
6. Indianapolis
7. Carolina
8. NY Jets
9. Miami
10. Seattle
11. Washington
12. Arizona
13. San Francisco
14. Pittsburgh
15. Tampa Bay
16. San Diego
17. New York Giants
18. Atlanta
19. Buffalo
20. St. Louis
21. Cincinnati
22. Kansas City
23. Dallas
24. Baltimore
25. Philadelphia
26. New Orleans
27. Minnesota
28. Detroit
29. Oakland
30. Cleveland
31. Tennessee
32. Jacksonville

Chicago rates as far and away the number 1 team, and it should be no surprise to anyone. Arizona has been a goldmine for opposing D/STs, and Chicago have been an incredibly opportunistic D/ST. The only downside to this play is that they're on the road, but let's face it, no one in their right mind should sit Chicago D/ST for any other team this week (although if you somehow have Chicago and Denver, Denver is a strong enough play with enough upside to justify it).

Denver, for their part, might have a higher floor than Chicago, but with a slightly lower upside. They play at home, are huge favorites against Cleveland, and have been on fire lately. After all, if you have been banking on Denver for your postseason, this is the week you've been drooling over.

I will be targeting New England in my leagues that I've been playing the wire, and I'll be starting them in my second leg of my money league championship game as well. They've got a great matchup, and I really like their chances subjectively; all the better that the numbers work out well too!

**Tier 1**: Chicago &amp; Denver

**Tier 2**: Green Bay, Houston, New England, Indianapolis, Carolina, NY Jets, Miami

**Tier 3**: Seattle, Washington, Arizona, SF, Pittsburgh, Tampa

Overall, it's fixing to be a very good week for D/ST scoring.

*Week 15 results*

1. ARI
2. CIN (8)
3. TEN (9)
4. HOU (5)
5. DEN
6. NO
7. SEA (4)
8. CAR
9. ATL
10. OAK (7)
11. GB (6)
12. MIN
13. PHI
14. NYJ
15. MIA (1)
16. WAS
17. DAL
18. CHI
19. SF
20. DET (3)
21. KC
22. SD
23. JAX
24. NE (10)
25. PIT
26. BAL
27. IND
28. STL (2)
29. NYG
30. CLE
31. TB
32. BUF

As long as you were able to get away from St. Louis or Detroit, you likely had a great week following along. Miami did exactly what I was hoping for from them, albeit with a little less upside than I was hoping for, but they held Jacksonville to just 3 points of offense. St. Louis got steamrolled, but Detroit performed fairly well - their final score isn't going to represent just how well they played (or how poorly Arizona played) on Sunday.

Beyond the top 3, the 4th through 9th place rankings all placed in the top 10! Here's hoping that continues - best of luck this week to everyone!

**Also, a note:** These rankings are just a guideline. In attempting to strip human subjectivity out of fantasy football, I do present a problem: what happens when I suggest you sit your ""stud"" D/ST like Seattle, who is on fire, for someone like Carolina? Ultimately, you're the only person who can choose your own starters. If you know you won't be able to stand losing your playoff matchup with the Seahawks on the bench, then by all means, start Seattle! Just don't expect me to agree with your choice. :)",Quality Post,False,,t5_2qlqq,False,qualitypost,,True,t3_152e7e,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/152e7e/week_16_dst_rankings/,

So my big bro spent the last year putting together LeagueHeads - a game/site like normal fantasy football, except instead of competing with fake rosters you go head to head betting the lines of that week's games with a fantasy bankroll.

There's been countless situations over the years where things don't look right and it's all because someone hit the wrong button.

Last year Seattle blocked a punt and returned it for a TD late in the game and it wasn't credited until the morning after. Billy Cundiff had 20-something points and it's because they doubled all his kicks so he had like 8 made field goals. Just last night, Mason Crosby's FG that was wiped out by a defensive penalty stayed in his stats and the box score so he had 7 points after only 3 extra points. 

Defensive scoring changes the most because sometimes it's not immediately clear if the defense should be credited with a sack or if it was a rush of no gain. Blocked punts/TDs and that sort of thing never seem to get done right the first time, and sometimes they don't even wait for stat corrections from Elias on Wednesday/Thursday. I've gone to sleep with one result and woken up Tuesday with another.

Even just yesterday, Reggie Wayne was given a 25 yard rushing loss that was actually a long reception. Last week, a punter apparently kicked the ball -999 yards.

Plays like the Tampa Bay/Kansas City circlejerk where the punter got a punt blocked, recovered, looked like he went down but chucked the ball up to a Kansas City LB, and then that same defender may or may not have gone out of bounds at the 1 yard line... if you're going to try and follow stat tracker after something like that, good luck.

Just know that there are basically millions of people playing fantasy football on ESPN and Yahoo so if there's something that doesn't look right, you're not the only one to notice it and you're not going to get screwed because of it.",,False,,t5_2qlqq,False,,,True,t3_11iacb,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/11iacb/live_scoring_is_unofficial/,

This was fun, good luck to you all tomorrow! 

(Shameless plug) I do all of my player rankings early in the week on my website, [Fantasy Football Filosophy](http://fffilosophy.weebly.com/index.html). It's a pet project, and it is by no means perfect, but hopefully it can help you out with a few questions. Thanks everyone.

______________________________________________________________

I know these threads pop up time to time and naturally, you wonder: why wrigsam?

In honor of the Cam Newton thread, I'll give you ten reasons:

1. I'm bored on a Saturday afternoon and will try to answer all questions for the next couple of hours.
2. I have the Reddit badge for verified email.
3. As an Illini fan, college football will not distract me today.
4. I'm 3-0 in my league because no one else knows what they're doing
5. I told my fiance that I'm working on a project. This is the project
6. I don't think I'm gonna get to 10 reasons.
7. I have hopefully helped a good amount of you at least once, and I hopefully gave good advice.
8. This is my 12th year of fantasy football.
9. Go Bears?
10. Over the 12 years of fantasy football, I developed a forumla/algorithm for WDIS so I can go with more than gut. Hopefully that will help you here. 

**EDIT**: Wow I'm already like 30+ comments behind. I'm really trying to get to all of you! Sorry if I have to be brief now, I want to please the masses. Also, as predicted, Illini are down big already.

**EDIT** Well I guess my Saturday is shot. 300 comments? Really?

**EDIT** Taking a break. Sorry I can't answer all questions. It looks like the mods put up WDIS threads. I would start going with those. Keep checking out my site for any extra help. Thanks guys!

Bullshit! I call bullshit! 
Each and every year I read the rankings. I do 500+ mocks. I scour the web for data, planning my draft order by making the hard decisions on which positions I have to fill early and which I will wait on… and it always is for naught. You see, I am a FF loser. But I am the worst kind of loser. I am a loser that doesn’t even understand why he is so awful.  It all started when I played in my very first league several years ago and got lucky. I happened to get Drew Brees in the mid rounds when nobody knew he was going to be great in NO. I happened to choose RBs that avoided injury that year and hung on to their jobs, and I ended up winning the very first league I had played in. From that point on I was hooked.

Fast forward a bit.  I have continued year in and year out since then chasing that elusive trophy. Each and every year finding another creative way to lose. Drafting QB too early, missing my window on RBs, drafting old RBs, getting sucked into runs at positions like a fool, and even drafting too many players at the same position I was already strong in because I didn’t want to “reach” at another position… and so on. I have failed my friends and I can’t even tell you why. My regular season record last year was 7-5 and for the 3rd season in a row, I did not make the playoffs. 

The problem was, and still is, that I do not understand how to build a winning FF team. I do not understand how anyone could possibly be able to consistently predict the future. All of the experts rank this and that, but in the end, all they are doing is guessing. There are no crystal balls. Matthew Berry cannot guarantee if AP will indeed have another monster year or if he will score 70 pts before blowing his knee out week 4. All we can do is speculate based upon previous season’s performances, and projected potential. I look at the results of mock drafts of players that have a basic understanding of FF and cannot tell you who has the good team. They all have potentially good players; they all got their RBs early, waited till later on DEF, and drafted a K in the final round. But only a few of these teams will be good enough to play in those final few weeks, and only 1 of them will receive the trophy in the end.

So my question to you Reddit is… Is it all just bullshit? We can’t read the future, no one really knows if this person will outperform his competition, and we certainly can’t know that on week 12 he will get us the X points we need from that position to win that game. I’m not looking for player specific responses but rather a 10,000 foot aerial view of what is supposed to happen in this game. Currently, I truly feel as if I am so far away from understanding this process that I may be beyond the help of even the best of you.

Thank you for your time in advance.

Welcome back!

For those of you not following along from the beginning, a word on methodology: **I derive each team's expected scoring from widely available gambling lines, and these are combined with a ""special teams"" score for each team based on their current matchup and each teams' year-to-date performance.**

Week 14:

**Tier 1**

1. Seattle

**Tier 2**

2. San Francisco

3. Cleveland

4. Chicago

5. Denver

**Tier 3**

6. NY Jets

7. Buffalo

8. Tampa Bay

9. Minnesota

10. Cincinnati

11. Jacksonville

12. Atlanta

13. Green Bay

14. Indianapolis

15. Kansas City

16. Arizona

17. St. Louis

18. Washington, DC

**Are you really this desperate?**

19. NY Giants

20. Miami

21. New England

22. Dallas

23. Baltimore

24. Carolina

25. Tennessee

26. Houston

27. Philadelphia

28. Detroit

29. New Orleans

30. Oakland

It's a strange week, to say the least. Seattle really is in a class of its own this week: if they're somehow still on the waiver wire, or if someone dropped them last week in anticipation of the CB suspensions, snag them ASAP. **This is the best rating of any team for any game all year long so far.**

The second tier shouldn't have any surprises either. Cleveland has been a great second tier D/ST throughout the year, at least when they're at home with a good matchup, and that continues this week. They're healthy and playing against the Kansas City Slot Machines at home, so that certainly qualifies.

As for the tier 3 options, they're all solid but unspectacular, and they're fairly tightly bunched. I have NYJ clearly better than, say, Green Bay or Washington, but the separation between Atlanta and Green Bay, for example, is pretty negligible. Use your best judgment and pick accordingly!

Feel like a genius and king during and after the game.  My opponent started Steve Smith and Martellus Bennett, so he slightly outscored me.  But still, feeling great.  

Sunday:  Awful.  The highlights:

* Frank Gore (who I just traded for):  6 points
* Darren Sproles:  6 points
* DeSean Jackson:  7 points
* Eagles Defense:  3 Points
* Mike Wallace scored more points than the above players combined.
* Jared Cook:  Sitting on my bench with 20 points.

I end Sunday up by a little less than 17, no players remaining.  My opponent has…Aaron Rodgers and Packers D.  The genius I felt by starting Andre Brown is long gone.  

Monday:  Somehow, I convince myself I have a chance.  Watching the game, Rodgers isn’t doing much but neither is the Seahawks offense.  Fast forward to the final drive:  The Seahawks begin just past the 45 yard line, and I look at the scoring breakdown.  If the Seahawks score a touchdown they will have 14 points, putting the scoring bonus of Packers D down from 3 to 2.  Also, the drive would put them over 250 yards, bringing that bonus down from 3 to 1.  The three point decrease is enough to give me the win.  I am freaking out.  Obviously, we know what happened – but here I am, worried that they won’t kick the extra point, or might take a knee.  The stress continues.  Thankfully, they do a formal kick, getting them 14 points.  I check the score  - I have won the closest fantasy football game of my life, 113.90 to 112.62.

Tuesday:  I wake up and check my league.  Something has gone wrong.  I check the scores.  There has been a stat adjustment.  Green Bay allowed 238 yards, not just over 250.  My opponent is back in the 3 point bonus.  The tables turn – he wins 114.62 to 113.90.
I know most people don’t like hearing these stories, but holy fucking christ, what a week.

As most of you already know, [quickonthedrawl](http://www.reddit.com/user/quickonthedrawl) has also been posting weekly team defense projections. His are based more on things like the spread, whereas mine are based [solely on recent performance data](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1500sv/boy_those_super_sneaky_dsts_for_the_week_the/c7i279b). [Here's a comparison](http://i.imgur.com/XdYWF.png) between [my week 15 projected rankings](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/14obf7/week_15_team_defense_dst_projections/) and [quickonthedrawl's week 15 projected rankings](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/14oiuw/week_15_dst_rankings_and_ytd_analysis/). If you're looking for a comparison of the rest of the rankings from week 15, [here you go](http://i.imgur.com/F3r78.png). 

Clearly, my #1 ranking (Detroit) didn't perform up to the level that it was supposed to, given the fact that Arizona was supposed to be such an easy matchup. (Note: I use the Yahoo scores for DSTs, so ESPN leagues might have had different scores.)

I also performed a new kind of comparison this week between myself and quickonthedrawl by assigning ""accuracy points"" to each of the top 10 rankings for myself and quickonthedrawl for the last 3 weeks (when I started doing this). Basically, the higher up in the projected rankings you get (e.g., 1, 2, 3), the more important the accuracy, and therefore the more points I added or subtracted to the total accuracy score. [Here are the results](http://i.imgur.com/YRHUb.png), based on the scoring system shown at the top of the image.

Final note: Be sure to check out [quickonthedrawl's week 16 rankings](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/152e7e/week_16_dst_rankings/), as his rankings take different factors into account, plus he's always great at answering specific DST questions.

**Update:** There was a typo in the NYJ and TEN week 15 actual scores, so I updated all the links with the modified projections. It didn't make much of a difference, with the exception of NYJ being moved down a few spots.

**Denarius Moore** - This guy looks sensational.  As long as Heyward-Bey, Murphy, and Ford stay hurt, I can see this guy having many great games as the Raiders come from behind and pass the ball for the entirety of the 2nd half.  Only competition for targets is McFadden at checkdown, since Zach Miller is now gone.  Real potential to become the ""Brandon Lloyd"" of this year and emerge as the Raiders' WR1.  
  
**Eric Decker** - This guy is HUGE for a slot reciever (6'3"").  Although I don't see him coming out on top of Brandon Lloyd, Eddie Royal's 2-4 week injury may provide you with some value here.  One would say 113 and 2TD against the Bengals is no large feat, but for a WW pickup, you may want to consider if you are weak at WR.  
  
**Danario Alexander** - 6'5"" with wheels.  Unfortunately, he has had 6 knee surgeries (correct me if I'm wrong).  This guy has Top 10 WR potential, but carries with him one of the largest health concerns a FF player could imagine.  He has inconsistency written all over him (due to knee soreness and limited snaps).  He has failed time and time again to stay healthy, even though he is still very young.  Great high risk/high reward if you are looking for a WR3/4 fill in.  He either won't do anything for you, or help you win the week.  
  
**David Nelson** - Another 6'5"" WR option.  Fitzpatrick has been throwing his way early and often.  Unfortunately, I don't see his role ever eclipsing Stevie Johnson's as WR1.  This guy is a good stash if you have the room and can't get the guys above.  I wouldn't start him just yet, though.  
  
**Nate Washington** - The only thing keeping him from being the WR1 is Kenny Britt (that's a big thing).  This guy benefits from easier/reduced coverage from CB2, not to mention has been putting up stats while CJ2K continues to falter.  Once Defenses start focusing on stopping Kenny Britt, look for CJ2K and Washington's #s to improve.  Great option in long TD bonus leagues.  
  
**Jacoby Jones** - This guy is a hype machine in the form of a WR and KR.  As long as Kevin Walter stays injured (apparently this doesn't seem to be as long as we thought), Expect to see Jacoby get 4-8 targets a game.  He has been ""due for a breakout"" for the past couple years, but has failed to impress.  If you get return yardage in your league, this guy gets a huge bump (and probably isn't on waivers).  
  
**Dexter McCluster** - In Yahoo leagues, this guy is listed as WR/RB (Bonus!).  In CBS he is listed as a WR.  Most leagues now are doing Start 2RB, 3WR.  This makes WR more scarce, but McCluster gets numerous carries with Jamaal Charles out.  I expect to see lots of dump passes/checkdowns/screens to McCluster with Charles gone for the year.  Super bump in PPR leagues.  
  
Some Players I'm avoiding; Jerome Simpson, Brandon LaFell, Jabar Gaffney, Brian Hartline, Preston Parker, Mohammed Massoquai.  
  
If you are curious about someone I didn't list here, or have any other questions, feel free to ask.  Depending on the popularity of this, I may do a RB and TE edition.

Last year I had to squeek into the playoffs due to tiebreakers at 7-6 despite being third in the league in points for and won the whole damn thing. I can feel this season slipping away from me. My team is good enough to go 5-1 the rest of the way, but there is no way I'll be that fortunate. I've played the highest scoring (non-me) team two weeks in a row when desperately needing a win and I see no reason to hope that my shitty luck will change anytime soon. I feel like I need to score the most points every week if I want to win.

This week was just brutal. If Batch catches that fucking perfect throw from Antonio Brown, if the Bears did the unthinkable and ran the fucking ball when they had 1st and goal from the 3 (nah, they would have just used Bush anyway), if Rice just had an average game (also known as, if Baltimore actually utilized their pro bowl RB) I would have finished with the most points this week and a win. Nope, instead I lose to the guy who scored the most points because Shonn fucking Green got a cheap TD.

So tell me, why do you hate fantasy football right now?

Two of those targets resulted in the aforementioned catches, one was a goal line look that was called back due to a knuckleheaded move by Hernandez. The incompletion was actually on Brady: he should have thrown it in front of Hernandez, as Hernandez had the corner beat. This is what we want out of Hernandez: goal line looks, and using him in various formation (he lined for two of those targets as a wideout, traditional and slot). 

2) Despite the gaudy offensive numbers of the night, the Patriots only had TWO red-zone appearances, where Patriot TEs usually excel. Of Gronk's ten touchdown grabs this season, 8 out of 10 of them have been red-zone grabs, while the 9th and 10th came from 24 and 28 yards out. The two touchdowns Hernandez has had was in the redzone and from 23 yards out. Hernandez didn't produce because the Patriots blew past the red zone too often. Of the two red zone looks, Hernandez had a play specifically designed for him (motion from the regular TE position to wideout) that led to the PI-nullified touchdown.

3) There was talk of Hernandez being limited all week. Well, in today's game, Hernandez was in the game for approximately 75% of snaps. In the three games he's played, he's been in for 71%, 41%, and 100% of snaps. That 100% of snaps game? The season opener. Hernandez has played in more snaps of a game than any other game since the season opener. Also, the Pats played less offensive snaps than they normally do, so expect more targets in ""normal"" Pats games. 

While both Gronk and Hernandez play different TE positions, Hernandez is well equipped with the skills and opportunity to have an output equaling (and even exceeding) what we've seen from Gronk this season. 

Don't lose hope! His performance today was more the fault of the ineptitude of the Jets. ",Quality Post,False,,t5_2qlqq,1353663821.0,qualitypost,,True,t3_13nsxa,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/13nsxa/hernandez_owners_fear_not_hernandez_barring/,

1373896086.0,65,self.fantasyfootball,1ic7ig,The Case for Alex Smith,83,18,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1ic7ig/the_case_for_alex_smith/,"Alex Smith was one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL last season. Yea, that's right, let it sink in for a moment. Of players with at least 200 pass attempts **Smith lead the league with an amazing 70.2% completion percentage**. In fact in the past 25 years only 3 players have finished a season with a higher completion percentage Drew Brees, Joe Montana, and Steve Young.

But his completion percentage was only that high because all he did was check down right? WRONG! **Last season Smith averaged nearly 8 yards per attempt which was good for 5th highest in the league. He also ranked 5th in TD% converting 5.96% of his attempts into touchdowns which beat out players like Tom Brady and Matt Ryan**. Alex Smith also showed that he could step up where it counted most **leading all passers with at least 15 red zone pass attempts in both red zone completion percentage and red zone touchdown percentage**.  By almost any measurably quality Alex Smith was one of the most productive quarterbacks in the NFL last year. In fact the only thing that kept him from being a fantasy stud was volume.

That’s were Andy ‘I am the Walrus’ Reid steps in. Reid’s offenses have been in the top 10 in pass attempts for 7 of the past 9 years. In that time **Eagle’s quarterbacks have averaged 613 pass attempts, 4400 yards, and 26 TDs per season**. In fact Reid has been able to get 300+ yard passing games from players like Jeff Garcia, Kevin Kolb, Nick Foles, A.J Feely, and **Michael Vick who before joining the Eagles only had 2 300+ yard performances in 74 games but threw for over 300 yards 9 times under Reid.**

Using Reid’s average number of pass attempts per season if Smith was able to keep the same pace in 2013 that he did in 2012 he would finish the year with 613 attempts, 431 completions, 4888 yards, and 37 TDs. Obviously those numbers are unrealistic but they do demonstrate what an amazing cushion Smith has. **Even factoring in a 10% decline in his YPA, TD%, and Comp. percentage he’d still end the year with nearly 4400 yards and 33 TDs.**

All of that and we still haven’t even gotten to the icing on this fantasy football sleeper QB cake. Over the past 9 years Reid’s QBs have averaged nearly 400 rush yards and 3 TDs per year. Reid has shown he’s not afraid to call his QBs number in close getting at least 3 rushing TDs in 6 of the past 9 years. Smith has shown flashes of the mobility he displayed at Utah in the NFL and should get to take full advantage of it this year.

Playing behind one of the better offensive lines in the NFL and with a solid set of weapons lead by Dwayne Bowe and Jamal Charles Alex Smith is a nearly risk free option you should keep in mind as you go into your fantasy football draft this year.",,False,,t5_2qlqq,1373910235.0,,,True,t3_1ic7ig,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1ic7ig/the_case_for_alex_smith/,

1345487109.0,67,self.fantasyfootball,yj9tt,The fantasy demise of LeGarrette Blount has been greatly exaggerated.,83,16,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/yj9tt/the_fantasy_demise_of_legarrette_blount_has_been/,"I'm to lazy to put my thoughts into well formed paragraphs, so I'll use bullet points:

**He Has Talent**

* Ran for over 1000 yards and 6 touchdowns in only 11 games while averaging 5 YPC as a rookie in 2009.
* If you take his 2009 numbers and project them to a 16 game season he would have had over 1400 rushing yards.
* Had nearly 1000 total yards on 4.2 YPC in 14 games last season on one of the worst offensive teams in the NFL that was also **dead last in rushing attempts**. In 4 of those 14 games Blount was given less than 10 carries.
* If you take the 10 games where Blount received double digit touches and project it over 16 games he would have had over 1100 rushing yards.

**He Has Opportunity**

* New Bucs Head Coach Greg Schiano has said multiple times he plans to run the ball a lot this year.
* The Bucs also added arguably the best offensive linemen in the entire NFL, Carl Nicks, to an already impressive offensive line. 
* In the first two preseason games of the 107 offensive plays run Schiano has run on 63 of them, basically a 60-40 run to pass split. 
* Given that average NFL team runs 1015 total plays from scrimmage, at even a 55 to 45 run to pass ratio would give the Bucs well over 500 rushing attempts. 
* Let's assume the Bucs run 970 plays, how many they ran last season, this season and run the ball 54% of the time for 523 rushing attempts. Of those 523 let's eliminate 75 for QB runs, WR reverses, and RB/FB runs not by Blount or Doug Martin.
* That leaves around 450 rushing attempts to be split between Blount and Martin. I find it hard to believe Martin, who never eclipsed 300 touches in college, will all of a sudden be given 300+ touches in his rookie year along with all the 3rd down work. Which means at worst Blount receives 45% of these touches and at best would receive 60%. Which means Blount is a pretty good bet for somewhere between 200 and 270 carries. 

**Worst Case Scenario:** Blount is on the wrong side of the committee, gets 45% of the carries, his YPC carry drop to around 4, receives none of the goal line work and he ends the year with 700 to 800 rushing yards and 2 to 4 TDs.


**Best Case Scenario:** Blount holds onto the starting job, receives 60% carries, keeps his YPC up around 5, gets most of the goal line carries, and ends the year with 1200 rushing yards and double digit TDs.",,False,,t5_2qlqq,False,,,True,t3_yj9tt,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/yj9tt/the_fantasy_demise_of_legarrette_blount_has_been/,

A year ago, the front page would have consisted of maybe 5-10 WDIS threads, 5-10 articles and the rest were general discussion threads. Now the front page is almost entirely ""hey, look at my lineup, what should I do?"" posts. 

I am fine with offering lineup advice, and I think that is one of the things that makes this sub great. However I think specific WDIS questions foster interesting discussion, whereas these lineup posts seem to just be the work of people who are a little too lazy or lack the self-confidence to make the decisions themselves.

Unfortunately, making these decisions is what fantasy football is. Where is the fun if someone else is making them for you?

Anyway, if I'm just being some old, ""get off my lawn"" guy, and others like this subreddit much more the way it is, I will happily go away. 

EDIT: Several people have mentioned r/fantasyfb. I have been subscribed there since it was created but I have other issues with it: it has a small user-base and is a little too moderated. I think posts like ""what is going on with Darren McFadden?"" build good discussion. I am just really bothered by screen shots of lineups with no particular question.

So, I have made a spreadsheet that shows the Fantasy Pros composite rankings on the left, ESPN rankings on the right, and then the difference between them in the next column: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArtfjLdB7UVQdGJWbUFWSkd0b1hQWk8xVlV0ZkVZemc#gid=0 A negative difference shows that ESPN is overrating that player relative to Fantasy Pros, and a positive difference means ESPN is underrating that player relative to Fantasy Pros. I have also made the same spreadsheet with fantasyfootballcalculator's ADP compared to ESPN's rankings https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArtfjLdB7UVQdFRXSDk0eVV4UkhKaG0tRk9icVBCU3c#gid=0 . I kinda messed it up and did it inconsistent to the last one, so a positive number means ESPN is underrating that player relative to FFC's ADP and vice versa. By using both of these, you can find good value picks and other advice, like ESPN overrates QBs and underrates players like Lamar Miller and Demarco Murray. There may be a few mess-ups in the sheets, but I'd say 98% of it is right. Enjoy!

1374856532.0,63,self.fantasyfootball,1j3t1i,The reason you shouldn't be afraid of Megatron in the 1st round as well as the case for Reggie Bush (Long post),70,7,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1j3t1i/the_reason_you_shouldnt_be_afraid_of_megatron_in/,"Ok, so I want to start this post saying that I know a lot of people are already really high on Calvin (how couldn't you be?), however there are those people who feel they NEED to draft a RB in the 1st, and this post is more directed at you.

For all intents and purposes, I'm comparing Reggie Bush and Jahvid Best.  Let's take a look at how their combine #s match up:

* Best: 5'10"" 199 lbs.  4.25 40 yd dash (wow).  18 reps on bench.  32.5"" vertical.  9'5"" broad jump.

* Bush:  5'10"" 201.5 lbs.  4.33 40 yd dash.  24  reps on bench.  40.5"" vertical.  10'8"" broad jump.

I know these are just numbers, however if you watch the two play and compare their running style, they are very similar.  They both are fast players who excel playing on turf and running in the open field.  They both can catch passes and make defenders miss rather than run over people.

Jahvid Best played in the first 6 games in 2011 before getting hurt, in those games he averaged 112.8 combined receiving/rushing yards and 0.5 TDs.  The only real tape I could find to evaluate that season is a meh [highlight tape](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9Of2Ox9ljM).  In this tape, however you can see a number of things:

*  Because defenses worry about Calvin, Best frequently sees 6 or 7 men in the box.

*  Detroit loved to run not only middle screens with Best, but also line him up on the outside and run quick screens, I believe Bush was made for this type of role.

*  When Det spreads it out, Best was guarded by a safety or even a *linebacker* and would either toast them to the inside or run down the field.  Bush can beat LBs all day.

*  Detroit often comes out in a 4 or 5 wide spread inside the 15 yard line, which leaves Best lined up with LBs, enough said there.

I will get to why this is all important with Calvin in this next part.

...

Calvin Johnson is coming off of am amazing, record breaking season.  I realize he fell inside the 5 yd line quite often and that had something to do with his low TD # compared to 2011, however I remembered that Calvin grabbed 2 TDs in each of his first 4 games that year.  It could be a coincidence, but I like to look into stuff like this.  

Like I said earlier, Best played in 6 games in 2011, the first 6 games.  I checked out some [Calvin tape](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nqTLSXV3zc) from the first 4 games and I saw some things on here.  I'm not going to go into every play, just the ones that jumped out to me.  Let's start with game 1:

*  First TD - Best was on the field and defense was in 2 man under, Calvin just won this one.

*  Second TD - inside the 5 with Leshoure on the field, however defense left him manned up on the outside.

Game 2:

*  First TD - inside the 15, Best on the field, another 2 deep man under (which Calvin can beat any time apparently).  Easy money.

*  Second TD - inside the 5 with Best on the field.  Man coverage on Calvin on the outside, easy slant TD.

Game 3:

*  First TD - Long one.  Best in game, defense walks 1 safety up and brings 8 in the box, Calvin left manned up, 60 yd TD.

*  Second TD - 5 yd line, Best in game, defense in 4 deep zone and Calvin just makes a play here.

*  Notable 40 yd completion - Best in the game, another man under 2 deep safety and Calvin roasts it.

Game 4:

*  Notable 20 yd completion - Best in game.  Calvin man coverage, easy money.

*  First TD - This one was just a Calvin play.  Triple coverage, Stafford just threw it up.

*  Second TD - Inside 5 yd line, Leshoure in the game.  Calvin man coverage, easy fade TD.

...

Watching both of these highlights has showed me one thing: when the Lions have a good RB, they just play off of what the defense gives them.  If the defense covers Calvin and puts 6 or 7 in the box, Bush will get the ball in the open field via handoffs, screen passes, slant routes, etc.  If the defense puts 8 in the box at any point, Calvin goes deep.  

Inside the red zone, the Lions like to come out in a spread.  If the defense has a lot of LBs on the field, they just run Best on a route and burn them *or* if Calvin is left manned up, it's easy money out there.

...

In summary, I believe that Bush will not only be a great value pick this year, but I also believe that Bush will open up Calvin when defenses decide to try and stop Reggie.

TL;DR Reggie Bush and Calvin Johnson are going to be good.",,False,,t5_2qlqq,False,,,True,t3_1j3t1i,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1j3t1i/the_reason_you_shouldnt_be_afraid_of_megatron_in/,

1350572566.0,62,self.fantasyfootball,11owo6,My NYG RB analysis: Bradshaw / Brown / Wilson ,82,20,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/11owo6/my_nyg_rb_analysis_bradshaw_brown_wilson/,"*News update: Bradshaw is practicing and will probably play.*

**If Ahmad Bradshaw is good to go**, expect Andre Brown to barely have even a few carries per game. NYG famously sticks with the people they believe in even if they are underperforming, and Bradshaw is performing extremely well. They do this for multiple seasons if necessary, so if he's struggling in a game, it's not like they'll switch him out for Brown. Bradshaw is the top dog as long as he can stand upright. He played with two broken ankles for a season to prove it.

**If Bradshaw is limited**, expect all of his lost carries to go to Brown, as long as Brown is healthy and cleared to play. Wilson will not have any RB carries because he cannot (and the coaches know and publicly have stated he cannot) block at the NFL level, and that's what they consider an RB's primary responsibility in Eli's offense. (*EDIT: Yes, I know those news stories about blocking were about Brown, not Wilson. Those were in answer to why Brown wasn't getting a time-share with Bradshaw after Brown's big yardage games. But Wilson is a rookie who graduated college a year early and stands 5'9 at 200 lbs. Brown is bigger and more experienced.*)

**If Bradshaw is out**, expect Brown to get plenty of carries and probably play just as big. There's a lot to suggest the recent run success is a result of a reinvigorated offensive line with a few key players returned from injury. Even with their high-flying passing game, the Giants are a team that commits to the run relentlessly as an old-fashioned style of football. And if you think they'll put up big points and get ahead in a game, they're certainly conservative enough to just run it as long as they are able. But if you think they're going to play from behind in a game, expect Eli to air it out.

**If Bradshaw and Brown are out** expect to be disappointed if you play any Giants RB. ~~I wouldn't be surprised if Scott had more carries than Wilson even if Wilson is officially right behind Bradshaw on the depth chart. But you'd have to be in the deepest league imaginable to pick up Scott - go with another RB somewhere else.~~ (News update: Da'rel Scott had knee surgery yesterday and will miss at least several weeks)

**So to summarize:**

* Bradshaw is a fine RB2 and certainly worth playing in good match ups as long as he is healthy enough to stand upright.

* Brown is a fine RB3 if Bradshaw goes down entirely because of the NYG O-line and the danger of Eli, but if Bradshaw is only limited, it would only be worth playing Brown in fairly deep leagues and against good match-ups.

* Wilson is not getting RB carries in almost any scenario one could imagine. It's not because of the fumbles; it's because he can't block. He is not worth having on your roster unless your league is exceptionally deep, or you value special teams yardage in some way.

* It should also be pointed out that Bradshaw being off the field significantly hurts **Bennett's** value at TE because he's held in to block, and on the other side, a strong running game (and playing from ahead) marginally hurts Eli's value.

1319477735.0,61,self.fantasyfootball,lnbfn,My thoughts on a few Running Backs.,90,29,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/lnbfn/my_thoughts_on_a_few_running_backs/,"Since the complaints about amateur content on r/fantasyfootball, I figured I'd put in my two cents and see what people think. Furthermore, I've been commenting on other threads and figured I post my opinions in an entire post. First, 

**Steven Jackson** (he should look good soon):

Weeks 9 through 14 are approaching, and Jackson plays Ari (9), Cle, Sea, Ari, SF, and Sea (14) (respectively). That being said, he did not do terrible against Dal (#2 run defense). Furthermore, I think this may apply to the the Rams in general, i.e. Bradford and Lloyd, theoretically, should dramatically improve in the subsequent weeks (if Bradford plays, of course). It should be noted that after these weeks, his schedule becomes terrible again.

PS: I know Seattle's run D isn't bad, but Rams have a serious chance of taking the lead, which equals more touches.

**Ahmad Bradshaw** (Sell him):

In the next 10 games Bradshaw faces the #1-4 running defenses 6 times and nothing below above #14, besides the Eagles, during the rest of the season (I believe that is correct; if not entirely, it is close.) Second, Bradshaw has been putting up consistent numbers against St. L, Ari, Sea, Phil, and Wsh. These are arguably the worst defenses in the NFL, besides Seattles strong run D, where Bradshaw tied his low of 9 fantasy points 3 times (standard scoring). Finally, Brandon Jacobs will back and cutting into Bradshaw's carries. I think it's time to sell Bradshaw.

TL;DR - He seems to have the worst schedule of any RB and will lose carries b/c of Jacobs return.

**DeMarco Murray** (Not that great):

In my opinion, he was Torrey Smith all over again. Who's he? He's the WR that went for 152 yards and 3 TDs against St.L in week 3 and hasn't really done much since. Until the next game, I'm afraid all Murray proved that any RB or WR against St.L should be considered.

**Knowshon Moreno**:

I see no reason to think he'll improve. He was not good as the number #1, and with McGahee out, he stills seems to be the obvious #2 (behind Tebow). Believe me, I despise Tebow.

Well, that's about it. If anyone has questions about anyone else I'd be glad to voice my thoughts.

EDIT: I figured I'd post my thoughts on CJ2K also from another thread.

**CJ2K**

""The simplest way to put it is by analogy. Think of CJ2K as a stock that's bottomed out. Simply put, given his schedule and previous game stats, *there is almost no way he could do worse than he already has*. Do not sell the stock when you've lost part of your investment, especially when the stock has a good opportunity to rebound. I consider him a season investment, much like Arian Foster who missed the first few weeks, but is now lighting up defenses. That being said, I would not trade him low (at least until he plays the Colts.)

Disclosure: I do not own CJ2K, but I have been trying to trade for him for the last 3 weeks, primarily based on his schedule."" I've been trying to trade Bradshaw straight up for him, which IMO is a great deal.",,False,,t5_2qlqq,True,,,True,t3_lnbfn,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/lnbfn/my_thoughts_on_a_few_running_backs/,

I needed a win in the last regular season game to go to the playoffs. The Sunday games went well. My team trailed by 9 going into the Monday night game. I had Eli Manning left and my opponents players had all played. All I needed was 10 points. I nervously watched the entire game. With about 2 mins to go Eli had put up enough points to put me ahead by 1. I was sure I had locked in my playoff spot and was already celebrating. On their opponents next drive they went 4 downs without a first and gave the ball right back to the Giants. At that time Eli had 12 yards rushing which gave him exactly 1 point. That's when I realized he would be taking a knee each play and, with their opponent short on timeouts, they would have to play 3 downs. I sat there hoping he would just hand it off once, but nope. He took a knee three plays in a row. Each time taking away 1 rushing yard and leaving him with 9 total rushing yards. This brought his total points to 9 and resulted in a tie. There were no tiebreakers in place at the time and I missed the playoffs that year. Since then we have adjusted the rules to do away with ties.

With that in mind, I'd like to remind everyone of the [Posting Guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/jjf92/creating_some_submission_standards_for_submitting/) that were implemented last year, which is conveniently located to the right under Helpful Links (and they are helpful!).   

A post could be titled ""Drew Brees or Tom Brady?"" (In fact I see two posts under 'new' posted in the last hour with vague titles like this). But is it a question about who to draft, a trade, who to keep? The tagging system introduced last year allows everyone to quickly see the type of post that has been submitted. Note, that the it is not a a requirement, and you will not be banned for not using  it. It simply exists for organization and to make navigating the hundreds and thousands of posts that are coming over the next several months easier. 

Here they are the guidelines as a reminder.    

* Rate my team - use tag [RMT] before title of post.    

&gt;ex: [RMT] Please rate my mock draft.    

*Review this trade - use tag [Trade] before title of post. Also clearly state give/get in title.   

&gt;ex: [Trade] Give Ray Rice / Get Ryan Leaf    

* Who do I start? - use tag [WDIS] before title of post. Post names of players being considered in title.    

&gt;ex: [WDIS] Peyton Manning or Eli Manning    

* Waiver Wire - use tag [WW] before title of post. Say who you are thinking of picking up and dropping in the title.    

&gt;ex: [WW] Drop Kevin Kolb for Mcnabb?    

* Keepers - use tag [KEEPER]. Explain the rules of the keeper league. Do you have to give up a draft pick? How many keepers do you get? Etc.   

&gt; ex: [KEEPER] Keep Ray Rice or Lesean McCoy? No draft picks relinquished.   


*In addition to these tags, I also encourage everyone to explain the size and format (PPR or not) of your league when asking questions. It is also helpful to include the specific player match-ups, as well as your entire roster. This will help everyone give more complete and accurate replies.     

Please let me know if you have any additional ideas that would make this subreddit more organized and helpful for everyone.*   

Again, there will be no punishment for not complying. This is just an idea to help make this subreddit more readable. With that being said, just remember to be friendly, offer advice, upvote good discussions, downvote garbage (keeping reddiquette in mind), and most importantly have fun.

1352471043.0,57,self.fantasyfootball,12ww7v,How to Predict Vincent Jackson,59,2,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/12ww7v/how_to_predict_vincent_jackson/,"I know that Vincent Jackson is known as terribly inconsistent because of his days in San Diego, but I believe that his production this year shows some pretty noticeable trends.

[Here's some data I compiled](http://imgur.com/KS2lf), which includes his actual score, Yahoo's matchup rank per opponent, and footballoutsider's [matchup rank vs #1 WRs](http://footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef) (actually, the inverse of the rank they report, since their rank is hardest to easiest, so I wanted to turn it into easiest to hardest to make it similar to the way Yahoo ranks).

Here's what you'll notice:

* In terms of how many fantasy points VJax scored, there were 3 distinct tiers: outstanding, really good, and really bad.
* Outstanding: One game fell into this category. He scored 27.6 points against the Saints. Yahoo and FootballOutsiders both ranked the Saints as the easiest matchup.
* Really good: Four games fell into this category. All of his scores were between 14.4 and 18.8. All of the Yahoo matchup rankings were between 2 and 15. Almost all of the FO rankings were between 4 and 14, although one of them was 21.
* Really bad: Three games fell into this category. All of his scores were between 2.9 and 4.7. All of the Yahoo matchup rankings were between 23 and 30. All of the FO rankings were between 16 and 27.

In other words, VJax's production, although very up-and-down, has been very closely tied to the matchup, and therefore was fairly predictable. If the Yahoo matchup ranking was #1, he did outstanding. If it was ranked anywhere else in the top half, he did really well. If it was ranked in the bottom third, he did really poorly. The FootballOutsiders ranks were pretty aligned with these tiers as well, and even moreso if you figure that weeks 3 and 4 were a bit flukey. 

I think these correlations have to do with how Tampa Bay game plans: Against great pass defenses, they won't throw to VJax as much. (Maybe they throw more to Mike Williams in those situations, or maybe they hand it off more, although I haven't checked out their numbers in depth. It might also be interesting to compare the number of VJax targets to these rankings.)

Going forward, if these trends continue, here are my guesses about how many points he might score in his future games:

* Week 10 (vs. SD): 14 to 19 points
* Week 11 (vs. Car): 3 to 5 points
* Week 12 (vs. Atl): 3 to 5 points
* Week 13 (vs. Den): 4 to 7 points
* Week 14 (vs. Phi): 7 to 14 points
* Week 15 (vs. NO): 20 to 30 points
* Week 16 (vs. StL): 5 to 13 points
* Week 17 (vs. Atl): 3 to 5 points

**TL;DR:** The amount of points VJax has scored in each game this year has seemed to be very dependent on the matchup (and therefore predictable). So far, Yahoo's matchup rankings seem to be the best indicator.",,False,,t5_2qlqq,1352471341.0,,,True,t3_12ww7v,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/12ww7v/how_to_predict_vincent_jackson/,

Wavier wire priority was not in my favor as I aimed to add Miami's D with their dominant performances and soft schedule for my playoff push. Having added Danny Amendola now being 5 deep at WR in a 3WR PPR league I offered up Mike Williams, Kenny Britt or Danny Amendola to the team that landed Miami. It was agreed upon that I'd send Mike Williams and receive Miami D. To the naked eye, it would seem as if it's a one sided trade but given our league scoring Miami D had actually outscored Mike Williams on the year. 

As the day's go by, trade process date gets bumped to Sunday from Saturday after trade was agreed upon Wednesday night. Come Sunday morning we find out the trade has been vetoed. After a quick poll of 8 of 12 owners that morning, no one protested the traded. The commish then asked Yahoo why this happened while stating the obvious case that our league scoring was not factored into their decision meaning this review was not anything of the sort. 

Here's Yahoo's response:

&gt;Thank you for contacting Yahoo! Sports.
I appreciate your inquiry regarding Yahoo! trade review. I'll be happy to clarify the situation.
All decisions on trade protests are final. Explanations about why specific trades were approved or rejected are not provided.
We value your interest in Yahoo! Fantasy Sports. If you have further comments or questions, please feel free to reply to this email, and we will gladly assist you.
Thank you again for contacting Yahoo! Sports.

TL;DR: Yahoo trade review is not an accurate review of trades. It's simply a money grab.

Ask me your Week 14 WDIS questions.,66,12,380,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/14eg59/i_help_develop_the_projections_and_algorithms/,"My name is Sean Koerner and I work for Bloomberg Sports. I help develop the projections and algorithms as seen in the [Decision Maker](http://bloom.bg/RzKYzE) this year. I won the FSTA award for most accurate NFL projections in [2009](http://fsta.org/awards) and [2011](http://bit.ly/R8okyC). Also finished 1st in the Week 7 official r/fantasyfootball WDIS accuracy challenge as seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/12547z/official_rfantasyfootball_wdis_week_8_accuracy/). Wanted to take some time to help with everyone's tough lineup decisions for this week and will provide a free demo link in Decision Maker for all of your matchups. That way you can see the projections in real-time and see if any of the updates would change which player you would start in close situations. The scoring settings used in Decision Maker are set to [NFL.com](http://www.nfl.com/fantasyfootball/help/nfl-scoringsettings) default, so let me know if your scoring system varies in any way and I will factor it in. 

Edit: doing my best to get to many as I can right now. Will try to get to all of them at some point. Providing as many free links to the matchups as I can so you can track any changes later in the week (the projections will get sharper by Sunday morning). I believe DM is half off right now @ $4.99 so getting the tool for yourself is always an option! Still trying to get to everyone so thanks for your patience...and your questions!

Edit: going to take a break to watch the Thursday night game. Sorry if I couldn't get to all the Oak/Den questions. A brief description of how I feel about tonight's game: will be closer then people think...see it being a 27-20 Den victory. QBs: Peyton is a fantastic play as always and Palmer should rack up decent numbers in garbage time but think of him just outside of the top-20 this week. RBs: Moreno is a great start here as he should rack up close to 100 total yards with about a 50/50 chance of scoring. Reece and McFadden will cancel each other out and I don't really like either. WRs: Thomas is a must start, Decker is low-end WR2 and can be started, Stokely is active but would avoid. Moore and Hey-Bey are weak plays as Palmer is struggling to form great chemistry with either. TEs: Tamme took a bit of a hit with Stokely active but is still a top-10 option, Myers is a great play and nearly a top-5 TE for this week. I will be hanging out in the Thursday night thread if you want to chat about the game there. Will be on my phone and away from my comp so the sit/start questions will resume tomorrow.

Edit: I'm back on answering the comments I couldn't get to yesterday. Hopefully you skeptical Knowshon owners went with him! Luckily he's going to have a few extra days to recover from those 32 carries...he's probably hurtin' this morning. If Palmer threw that pass to a little more towards Myers and a little less towards Bailey my score prediction would've been awfully close, oh well. And for Myers owners, a better throw there would've made his night do a complete 180.

Edit: REMEMBER TO DOUBLE-CHECK THE DECISION MAKER LINKS I GAVE YOU FOR EACH MATCHUP TODAY since some of the tight decisions could have completely changed after updates to our projections. The projections can change based on player injury news to themselves, other players, inside information, weather, etc to ensure they are as accurate as possible.",Quality Post,False,,t5_2qlqq,1355068291.0,qualitypost,celeb,True,t3_14eg59,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/14eg59/i_help_develop_the_projections_and_algorithms/,
