**EDIT:**  I've added an addendum to the end of the article, addressing some common questions.  I'm reprinting them here:

&gt; **How did you market the game?**

&gt;Our friend Mary, from [IndieViddy](http://indieviddy.com), helped us market Dustforce by sending review copies of the game to numerous reviewers and bloggers. She also created and sent out press releases, as well as helped make Youtube videos for us at a time when we were most busy.

&gt; **Was it worth it? The numbers don't seem to translate into a very good salary.**

&gt; Without a doubt, yes, it was worth it. It is true that the final earnings, spread out among four people to account for almost 2 years of development is not particularly impressive, considering that more money could have been made at normal jobs, without taking the considerable risks that we took. However, it's important to note that the entire time we were doing what we loved, not for the goal of a monetary reward, but in order to make something beautiful come into existence.

&gt;It's not that money isn't important - instead, it was simply that the pleasure of making Dustforce was worth far more than the opportunity cost of working somewhere else. Instead of accumulating the means to an end, we just went straight for the end.

&gt;Lastly, our relative success of Dustforce was a fantastic foundation for us as a studio. We now have the financial means to work on a new project for some time; we also have a proven reputation and a community of challenge-loving players. It sets us up to really turn Spire into the best thing it can be. That's something worth more than just the money we made.",,False,,t5_2qi0a,1366175814.0,,,True,t3_1ch3dl,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ch3dl/details_of_the_first_year_of_sales_for_our_first/,

1367566592.0,560,self.gamedev,1dlwc4,Procedural Dungeon Generation Algorithm Explained,643,83,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dlwc4/procedural_dungeon_generation_algorithm_explained/,"So today I'm going to be a little different and talk about one technical aspect of my game [TinyKeep](http://tinykeep.com), that is random procedural dungeon generation. It's pretty over-engineered, but hopefully will give anyone interested some ideas on generating dungeon layouts for their own games.

The interactive demo can be found here:
[Dungeon Generation Demo](http://tinykeep.com/dungen/)

Here's how I do it, step by step:

1 . First I set the number of cells I want to generate, say 150. This is an arbitrary amount really, but the higher the number the larger the dungeon and in general more complexity.

2 . For each ""cell"" I spawn a Rectangle of random width and length within some radius. Again the radius doesn't matter too much, but it should probably be proportionate to the number of cells. 

Instead of using uniformly distributed random numbers (the default Math.random generator in most languages), I'm using [Park-Miller Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). This skews the size of the cells so that they are more likely to be of a small size (more smaller cells, less larger cells). The reason for this will be explained later!

In addition to this I ensure that the ratio between the width and length of each cell is not too large, we don't want perfectly square rooms but neither do we want really skinny ones, but somewhere in between.

3 . At this point we have 150 random cells in a small area, most are overlapping. Next we use simple separation steering behaviour to separate out all of the rectangles so that none are overlapping. This technique ensures that the cells are not overlapping, yet in general remain as tightly packed together as possible.

4 . We fill in any gaps with 1x1 sized cells. The result is that we end up with a square grid of differently sized cells, all perfectly packed together.

5 . Here is where the fun begins. We determine which of the cells in the grid are rooms - any cell with a width and height above a certain threshold is made into a room. Because of the Park-Miller Normal Distribution described earlier, there will only be a small amount of rooms in comparison to the number of cells, with lots of space between. The remaining cells are still useful however... read on.

6 . For the next stage we want to link each room together. To begin we construct a graph of all of the rooms' center points using [Delaunay Triangulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation). So now all rooms are connected to each other without intersecting lines.

7 . Because we don't want every single room to be linked to every other with a corridor (that would make for a very confusing layout), we then construct a [Minimal Spanning Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) using the previous graph. This creates a graph that guarantees all rooms are connected (and therefore reachable in the game).

8 . The minimal spanning tree looks nice, but again is a boring dungeon layout because it contains no loops, it is the other extreme to the Delaunay Triangulation. So now we re-incorporate a small number of edges from the triangulated graph (say 15% of the remaining edges after the minimal spanning tree has been created). The final layout will therefore be a graph of all rooms, each guaranteed to be reachable and containing some loops for variety.

9 . To convert the graph to corridors, for each edge we construct a series of straight lines (or L shapes) going from each room of the graph to its neighbour. This is where the cells we have not yet used (those cells in the grid which are not rooms) become useful. Any cells which intersect with the L shapes become corridor tiles. Because of the variety in cell sizes, the walls of the corridors will be twisty and uneven, perfect for a dungeon.

And here's an example of the finished result!

straight from the FAQ:

&gt;Why is Valve doing this?

&gt;There are two main reasons that Valve is creating Pipeline. The first is that we are frequently asked questions by teenagers about the videogame industry. ""What is it like to work on videogames? What should I study? What colleges are best for preparing me? How do I get a job in videogames?"" Pipeline will be a place where those questions can be discussed. The second is that Valve is running an experiment. Traditionally Valve has been a very good place for very experienced videogame developers, and not so good at teaching people straight out of school (the reasons for this and the tradeoffs are covered in the Valve employee handbook). Pipeline is an experiment to see if we can take a group of high school students with minimal work experience and train them in the skills and methods necessary to be successful at a company like Valve.

&gt;What is the objective of the website itself?

&gt;We want to establish a connection to the world of teenagers that are asking many questions about getting into the gaming industry. We look to answer many of these questions and are willing to reach out to the community and give them the information they need.

&gt;Why Pipeline?

&gt;When coming up with a name we wanted to with something that would connect to Valve to the community. We explored many different options such as ""Seed"" and ""Orenda"".

I thought you might be interested in my journey from someone who literally knows **nothing** about programming to a published game developer. I know that this type of post would have been really helpful for me when was just getting started. Hopefully I can inspire someone in a similar situation!

**THE STORY**

About a year and a half ago, I decided that I wanted to make a game. There was a problem though. A big problem: **I hadn’t programmed a day in my life.**

I always thought it would be pretty sweet to be a game developer but it was so out of reach that it never felt like a realistic goal. But one day in October of 2010 I just decided to go for it. I had nothing to lose so why not?

I learned bits and pieces of a bunch of languages, including C, Python, ActionScript, and Objective-C. Honestly though, I really don’t think it matters too much what languages you learn on. If there is one piece of advice that I can share about learning to program, it is this: **PROGRAM A LOT**. There really is no other way to learn besides doing, doing, doing, doing, and doing again. Every time you make something new, you find a thousand things that you did wrong before. Every time, you chisel away at your horrible programming skills until you’re finally able to make something that you can be proud of.

Along the way I made a ton of stupid, fun, and weird mini-games to help me learn. I made:

* [A game about a man-rodent](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/dtplj/thought_you_might_be_interested_in_my_very_first/) hiding in a town, attacking the townspeople
* [A text-based minesweeper clone]( http://youtu.be/Cn_Oibc4sjg) with a custom-sized board and mine-count
* [A game called Pizza Guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HLumD97DX8), about a guy who had to (you guessed it) deliver a pizza while trying to jump over an endless barrage of pipes of varying heights. The only result was loss. There was no win.
* [A game called Party Man](http://www.whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/1000000423.png), in which the the protagonist is driving along a grid, trying to reach a party. The problem was that my programming was still pretty bad at that point, so he kept literally crashing the party.
* [An app where you could create sequences of musical phrases](http://youtu.be/xWMsBGEwvbY) in the pentatonic scale
* [A flash clone of the classic snake game](http://whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/Racer.swf)
* [A flash clone of those driving-through-an-ever-shrinking-tunnel games](http://whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/Racer.swf)

Finally, I decided it was time to make a real game. Pretty much all of Polymer’s creation was iterative design. I never had an overall plan. I kept thinking, “I don’t know how to make a complete game. I just know how to make basic gameplay,” as if there were one way to make a game. But I realized I just need to make it however I could, even if it wasn’t necessarily the right or best way.

When I sent the game to beta testers, I was convinced that all I really needed to do was polish it up a bit. Oh man was I wrong. I had so many amazing suggestions from my testers that I just had to implement. I probably said, “I’ve only got one or two more things to add, then I’m done!” a thousand times.

Submitting to the app store was terrifying. I was so paranoid that I would forget something huge. Something that could break the game or get it rejected. But at the same time, it felt amazing. I finally did it. My creation, my baby, was done. I went from not knowing a thing about programming to finishing a game that I was very very proud of.

It’s already gotten some awesome previews on [Touch Arcade](http://toucharcade.com/2012/04/19/hands-on-with-whitaker-trebellas-polymer/), [Indie Game Mag](http://mobile.indiegamemag.com/looking-shapely-polymer-teaser-trailer/) and [Gamezebo](http://www.gamezebo.com/games/polymer/preview).

Of course, I hope Polymer sells well. But even if it doesn’t, I’m proud of myself for actually carrying this whole dream through. I’ve had trouble in the past making the journey from start to finish on big projects. Starting is easy. Finishing isn’t. Plus, programming Polymer has taught me so many amazing things. There’s a lot of really messy spaghetti code, but I honestly don’t care too much because it works. Next time I make a game I’ll be able to build upon what I’ve learned, and hopefully make something even more awesome. Until then though, I’m hoping for the best with Polymer. And I hope you enjoy it!

I'm not saying I never work for free.

But if someone in a position to make money wants me to work for free, well then I have to respectfully decline. 

What I certainly don't do is offer free work to the world, for a number of reasons:

* Just because you're doing it for free does not mean people will change their standards. They will want as much of your time as they can get, which means multiple drafts and iterations, multiple back and fourths of ""it doesn't quite fit, maybe try x?""

* If the music in their game is worth 0 dollars to them, your time and energy is also worth 0 dollars to them. 

* If they don't value either of those things, then you have to wonder if they value the success of their own project, and not to mention

* If they don't value their own project, it isn't likely to get done, and you will have wasted your time. I've worked on three projects in the last year with the promise of revenue share only to have the project completely lose momentum on all of them. If they are taking the project seriously, they can spare 50 bucks for some music, voice over, or art. 

* Finally, working for free is not good exposure! Your credit at the end of a game will not bring you more business. If anything, it's exposure that you do work for free, exposure that your work is worthless.

I've emailed back and forth developers who were running Kickstarters and through this I started to get some insight as to why many promising Kickstarter campaigns fail. They may seem like simple common sense (and they are) but they still seem to be overlooked too often.

I wrote this so hopefully I can provide some insight to indie developers who may be starting a Kickstarter campaign in the near future. I hope it helps.

I'll quote the whole article but the original is found here: http://nintendoenthusiast.com/15245/kickstarter-feature-part-1-why-kickstarters-fail-and-how-to-avoid-it/


""I’ve had the opportunity of observing a fair few video game Kickstarter campaigns over the past few weeks from a close proximity. Some succeeded, others didn’t. Being in touch with many of the campaign starters has given me a bit of insight into why some Kickstarters fail and others succeed. It’s too often that you see a really great concept fail to build any kind of steam in their funding. Extremely talented developers will be baffled when they see their projects never make it past lift-off. And yet others seem to glide towards their funding target with the simplest of ease.

It’s not magic or voodoo. Having a really good idea just doesn’t cut it on Kickstarter. There are some clear-cut factors that should be taken into account from the start. Of course, it’s never completely in one’s hands and there are many outside factors that you just can’t control. But before anyone starts a Kickstarter campaign I’d advise them to sit down with their development team and figure out how they will avoid these 3 pitfalls.

**1. Understand the Difference Between the ""Developer-Publisher"" Partnership and the ""Developer-Community"" Partnership**

Very often developers think that all a Kickstarter means is that you work hard on a Kickstarter page and then if you succeed, you walk off with your money and create your game. But that isn't true. The entire model of the relationship between you and your partner is different. Just like publishers get to have a say in the development of the game, the gamers also want to have a say. If you are to convince them to help you fund this project, you have to make sure they see clearly that this a relationship that includes them as an equal partner.

Now, everyone knows one part of the relationship: you give the fans gifts according to how much they back you. But that's not where it ends.

First of all, you should create a section that talks about you and your team. The fans want be part of this relationship and that means they want to get to know you. So, show a picture of yourself or your team and talk a little bit about what you guys like and what appeals to you. Make yourselves seem human. When you have an interview with a publisher you want to show how professional you are.  But your Kickstarter page is your interview with the fans. When you meet with gamers, you want to show them how you understand their mindset and how you're a gamer just like them with specific things that appeal to you. Only, you happen to be a gamer with incredible expertise and experience in the development side of gaming. So show both of those. Show them your gamer side but also your expertise.

Secondly, you should find a way to include the fans in the development process. Meaning, there should be certain decisions where you provide a poll and let the community decide where to go and what to do. This is YOUR community now and they want to feel like you're including them throughout the development. This sense of partnership makes the gamers excited to back your project. So, on the original Kickstarter page tell them where you have already planned for them to be involved.

Third: provide lots of updates. Nothing spells doom to your prospective community more than a campaign-leader who stops providing updates. You must treat your backers like your own personal fanbase and the more you interact with your community, the more others will be willing to join along. That means that even after the game is funded, you can't stop with the updates. You don't have to update every day, but there should be some sense of momentum.

Lastly, appeal to a specific community wherever it's applicable. Go find forums or sites that already talk directly to this community and find a way to create a rapport. Sometimes you find yourself appealing to very broad audiences and see very little success, but if you strike a chord with a more niche community they can sometimes provide you with more support than the broader audiences. Don't wait until the last few days of your campaign to capitalize on this. Plan ahead and strike the iron will it's hot.

**2. The Project Isn’t Far Enough Along**

One of the biggest attitudes you have to have when making a Kickstarter campaign is: don’t expect to be like Double Fine. Double Fine succeeded in their Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter campaign because they were Double Fine. All Tim Schafer had to do was say he wanted to make another point-and-click adventure game and fans were already gathering in throngs to throw money at his feet. There didn’t have to be anything that remotely resembled a real game prepared for the campaign. But that is the exception to the rule. Only developers or franchises that have incredible persuasion among fans (usually due to nostalgia) can rely on that. Everyone else needs to have incredible content ready to show off.

Kickstarters are always found somewhere along a certain chronological line in the development process:

A) There are those who launch a Kickstarter with nothing but an idea or a “pitch” to the fans. The entire game is still an abstract idea and they must convince the backers that it’s a good one that deserves backing.

Pros and Cons: The advantage of this approach is that you will have the backing from the get-go and won’t have to cover any initial costs on your own if your target is high enough. The disadvantage is that there is a high risk of failing because no one believes in your project until there is something to see. (Of course, if your company is famous or has made many games in the past, then everything is different.)

B) Others wait until they have concept art prepared which will give their backers a mental image of the abstract game idea they had. These pieces of art are often all there is for backers to see for many weeks on end.

Pros and Cons: Again, this is similar to the previous stage, but only a bit more fleshed out. The problem here is that too many campaigns start this way. They assume they will find backers with just concept art. While it’s always possible to succeed, it’s a really crippling way to begin your campaign.

C) Some campaigns begin with a prototype video of their game. Their team has already begun to flesh out the game concept with their game engine. The video they show off is usually very early on in the development and can often be crude or very undeveloped. There aren’t many scenes of the game to demonstrate in the video yet. This too is meant to give backers a very early mental image of what the game will eventually look like.

Pros and Cons: This is where the majority of Kickstarter campaigns begin, and I find it to be flawed. Showing fans a crude idea of your game is a good way to put your worst foot forward. You want your first impressions to be really good. Too often developers hope fans will take a leap of faith forward in their mind and envision what the game will look like three months from now. They want the fans to see the vision that the developers have of the final product. But most often, they won’t. Some fans will buy into that vision, but many others will superficially walk away. They have to be sold on the game video, and there isn’t enough to sell them on it. The advantage of this approach is that the developers only have to fork over the cash for the initial stages of the project. The rest of the time they can ride home free on the support of their backers.

D) Then there are those teams that have advanced the game enough in development that their initial video is able to give a very good representation of the final vision. With a little more time and effort they would probably even be able to turn it into a demo for their fans to try. Some Kickstarters even decide to begin their campaign with a playable demo.

Pros and Cons: In my opinion, this is the place to begin your Kickstarter campaign if you want to ensure your success. My rule of thumb is: don’t start a Kickstarter campaign unless you’d be ready to let fans try a demo of your game already at this point. You might not have the time or money to actually work on releasing a demo, but the point is that if you’re still too embarrassed with your early prototype to let fans play a demo of your game then do you really think that a prototype video is going to sell them on it? Fans don’t have to actually play it to see how crude and premature the project is. If you feel confident enough in your project to allow fans to get a closer look then you can also feel confident that fans will be willing to buy into your vision.

E) Finally, there are campaigns that begin with a game that is mostly functional and could probably be released as is. But the developers want the funding to turn the game into something really special and fully realize their vision.

Pros and Cons: Sometimes these projects actually fail because the fans feel like you’re taking advantage of them. You already paid your way through most of the development and now you’re just using them in the last stretch. Fans want to feel like they were a part of the development process. They want to make decisions through polls and have a say. They want to come along for the ride with the weekly or monthly updates. Of course, many nearly-complete projects do succeed on Kickstarter but upon occasion you see those that fail.

—-

So, in summary: don’t start a Kickstarter campaign unless you’d be ready to let fans try a demo of your game already at this point.



**3. The Target Is Too High**

This rule is simple. Sometime you see two very similar projects and one succeeds on Kickstarter and the other doesn’t. The difference? One aimed for $5,000 and the other aimed for $10,000. Or one aims for $10,000 and the other for $50,000. They both could end up raising $45,000 but the second one loses it all when they don’t reach their target by the end of the campaign.

I know this is easier said than done because at the end of the day, those numbers are real. The teams sits down and crunches numbers. They know that the project won’t get done without this kind of money. But the question they have to ask themselves is, what will happen if we fail the Kickstarter? Did we succeed in getting the money we needed because we set a high-enough price?

It’s better to aim a bit lower than what you hope for but make the target one that is easy to reach. There is no set formula for doing this because every game is different. So, you should take a look at recent Kickstarters that seem somewhat comparable to your own and make a proper estimation of what you can target and still succeed.

And remember: Kickstarter campaigns that succeed, almost always get funded considerably above their target. I just took the last 12 video game Kickstarter campaigns to get funded and calculated their average funding. The average between them was to reach 256% of their target funded. So, whether your success will end up being 110% of your target or 400% of your target, you should find a way to include that in your target plans. Drop your initial target by a little bit and assume that if you succeed you will get a that extra bit added on to the final funding.


**4. Lack of PR**

Oh boy. This is the golden rule in my opinion. This is where I have seen first-hand the majority of Kickstarters fail. Kickstarters are so often run by brilliant individuals: game developers. And that means that their expertise is in coding and expert game design. What they usually haven’t had much experience in is dealing with PR. Usually, the previous companies they worked for had PR representatives or out-sourced their PR responsibilities to a specific PR firm (the majority of big publishers outsource their PR to a firm and most smaller developers hire a few individuals internally to handle PR.)

Working on two video game websites means that a large part of my day is working in PR/marketing. Whether it’s paying attention to how one build’s awareness of their brand on the internet, how to increase exposure, or what makes something go viral, these all have been my bread and butter for the past year and a half. So, when I noticed the lack of exposure in many Kickstarter campaigns it wasn’t hard for me to realize why many of the most promising ones were failing.

Again, we return to Double Fine. Don’t expect to be like Double Fine. Tim Schafer has instant virality potential. He said, “Adventure!” and the internet said, “KaBOOM!” Don’t expect your campaign to go viral like that unless you are well-known in the gaming world. If you’re like everyone else, you’re going to have to launch a PR campaign to get anyone to notice your project.

Basically, you’re going to attempt to get as many gaming websites to talk about your campaign. This will help spread your message to millions of gamers instead of a few hundred that like to stalk Kickstarter’s website. The way to do this is to email those websites. The way not to do this is to send a press report to their email. Take it from me: most gaming websites get more press releases in their email than they can handle and unless you are one of the more significant stories, your press release will probably end up in their trash bin.

Instead of sending a press release, send an email that seems personal. It should sound like you’re talking directly to the editor and informing them about your project. There has to be some kind of hook. Something that draws them to your campaign. The editor will only want to report on your game if he can make some kind of headline that draws attention. He/she is looking how they will benefit from running this story. So, feed them that line and reel ‘em in. Tell them what makes your game special. And assume they will only read one paragraph of your email. For the really big sites offer them more. Maybe an interview or an exclusive set of screenshots.

So, what sites should you email? As many as you can (and us, of course: ninten.enthusiast@gmail.com.) But, these are the ones that report on Kickstarters, so they are more likely to publish your story:

A) Kickstarters are practically the life blood of these sites and they will almost definitely spread the word to the Kickstarter community:

indiegames.com
Jayisgames
Rockpapershotgun
TIGSource
Indiegamemag
DIYgamer

If you want to really go thoroughly through all the decently-sized indie sites that would talk about your game this is a great list: http://www.pixelprospector.com/the-big-list-of-indie-game-sites/

B) These sites are massive but they are the ones that also report on Kickstarter campaigns pretty often. As long as a Kickstarter looks promising or has an interesting twist or innovation, they’re willing to report on it:

1367319222.0,435,self.gamedev,1dejg1,Have a game on Greenlight? A little tip to make it easier to let people vote for you.,507,72,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dejg1/have_a_game_on_greenlight_a_little_tip_to_make_it/,"Hey, everyone. I found an undocumented feature in Steam that makes it a bit easier to let people vote for your game on Greenlight. It took a bunch of work for me to find this so I thought I'd share it now that I have it working pretty well.

(I'm using my Greenlight page as the example for this, please don't consider this some kind of excuse for spam or something)

Anyway, you know how you can link people to your Greenlight like this:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=112030991
Which takes them to the page in their browser? It's cool and all but they have to log in to SteamPowered.com and usually do the steamguard thing which deters some voters (I had some complaints on Twitter which is why I decided to work on this).

And you know how you can use Steam to open certain embedded urls by going Start-&gt;Run-&gt;steam://url/SomethingHere/SomeIdHere?

Well, there's an undocumented (I had to hex-examine Steam to find it) embedded URL you can open that opens Steam directly to your Greenlight page on a users' computer, with them already logged-in so they can vote in 1 click. It's like this:
**steam://url/CommunityFilePage/112030991**

So that URL will open Steam and take someone straight to your Greenlight. One problem is that you probably want to share it on Twitter and Facebook, but social media sites don't consider things starting with steam:// as links so they're not clickable. Instead. put a file on your website called something like greenlight.php and put this code in it:
    **&lt;?php
        header('Location: steam://url/CommunityFilePage/112030991');
    ?&gt;**

Now, send someone a link to that .php file you created, and when they click it, Steam will open on their computer directly to your greenlight page! 

I created a special subdomain for mine that makes it easier to read: http://greenlight.blackannex.net/ which is literally just that code I linked above.

I hope this helps you all get more votes and brings you closer to getting your cool games on Steam! Good luck! :D

---------

edit: A lot of people have said you should use this to give people an option for how to vote' That's actually **exactly** what I did on my homepage, but I wasn't sure about linking it because of the whole self promotion angle. You all seem pretty happy with this advice though so I'm gonna go ahead and show you exactly how I implemented it.

1374164061.0,436,self.gamedev,1ikely,GOOD Gamedev Practices and Tips,504,68,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ikely/good_gamedev_practices_and_tips/,"So just recently I have noticed that this subreddit has lots of posts that seem to focus on the negativity surrounding gamedev or just come at gamedev from a defeatist or failure attitude, so in the hopes of turning this trend around and starting positive discussions again, I am going to present some good practices, rules and methods that can be followed to help improve your motivation, productivity, efficiency, happiness and general attitude towards your projects and game development.

###Source Control
This one is a bit of a no-brainer, but it still baffles me that some developers are happy to develop without using some form of source or revision control. This really does separate the big boys from the small. No matter how you try to justify it or come up with valid reasons, there are no excuses for not using versioning when you are developing. One thing that is guaranteed if you don't use source control is that at some point in the future you will run into problems, either wasted time, code confusion, 

Here are some useful source control links and information

##**Perforce**
This is a personal favorite of mine, it's free to setup your own depot at home (for &lt; 20 users), comes with some great client UI applications, and is very easy to learn. I would also argue that Perforce is a professional standard and all of the major games studios use it, so it is worth learning if you ever want to work for a larger game studio (Some people disagree with this point, but this is my opinion, based on all my previous jobs at large games studios) - [Perforce Link](http://www.perforce.com/).

##**Git**
It is worth learning Git purely because it will make your understanding of source control so much better. Git is fast becoming one of the leading source control solutions and there are a number of branches of the git framework that are used throughout the source control world. Public open source depots and online collaboration is also a great reason for learning Git - [GitHub](https://github.com/).

##**SVN**
I would consider SVN the younger brother of source control solutions, it is a good start if you completely new to source control and a good place to start, but generally I would not choose this solution myself over Perforce or Git. If you are looking for a windows SVN client I would recommend [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/).


###Time Management
Having good time management skills will mean the difference between a game that gets completed and a game that you will be developing for the rest of your life. Working on your time management takes time and there always many ways in which you can become a better scheduler and better use your time more efficiently.

##**Todo Lists**

I am a bit of an OCD list maker myself, I like to make lists about everything that I do. I literally have at least 3 different todo lists on the go when I am developing a game and like to use many different solutions to make sure I am capturing stuff that I need to do. I make notes the moment I think of something and all the time that I am thinking about my game and try to make sure that I capture every thought I make about it. I would advice you to do the same.

* Use your phone to make notes for you when you are not physically at your computer and able to access you main to do lists.
* Send email reminders to yourself with bullet points of stuff that you have thought about during the day.
* Try to organize and priorities your lists. Have a different list/category for small tasks and bugs (5-10 minutes), medium tasks (30mins-2hours) and day tasks (4 hours+)
* If you are using dev tracking software, break down your work into epics, stories, subtasks and bugs.

##**DevTracking**

Using some kind of tool to track your development tasks and bugs can be a great help. There are many benefits to having a tool like this that you can access anywhere and online, but there are also some offline solutions as well. The good news is that many of these tools are free or open source and it just takes a bit of searching and testing to find one that works well for you. Going full-on 'Agile Development' might be a bit overkill if you are a solo developer, but there is no reason why you can't utilize the same tools and best practises that make agile good.

Here are some useful online dev tracking tools:

* [youTRACK](http://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/)
* [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
* [Trello](https://trello.com/) - Thanks zaikman
* [http://todoist.com/](http://todoist.com/)
* [Top 10 Open Source Bug Tracking System](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/08/bug-tracking-system/)

##**Pomodoro Technique**

I recently mentioned the [Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) in another thread and a lot of people hadn't heard of this before. I find this method of working in discreet pre-defined periods of time with no breaks works really well for me and I would recommend that you at least give it a go. It might not work for you and some critics dont like it as a way of working, but give it a try, you never know it might help you out. Either way it is good to have a technique for splitting up your time periods and working to a schedule, even if game development is a hobby for you or something you do in your spare time, having a solid working schedule will help improve your productivity.


###Build Processes

One way that most developers waste time is by having inefficient build processes. You would be surprised how much time gets wasted if you do something redundant that takes up 5 seconds of your time every time you make a build. Even just reducing your build time and processes by a few seconds can save you whole hours over the course of your development A good way to start improving your build processes is to start small, try to locate any manual steps in your whole build process and then work on ways of removing them.

Some common things to look out for in your build process that can be automated:

* Copying header files to a root include directory
* Placing lib or DLL files into your source directory
* Converting asset files, textures, models, audio, etc.
* Copying the output exe to a 'deployed' folder after a compile.


##**Batch Files**

If you are doing lots of manual file operations, such as copying files between directories, running other batch files to generate intermediate files or generally doing lots of things by hand, then these processes can all be automated by using batch files. 

Here are some links to help get your started in learning batch programming:

* [Batch Files and Commands](https://cs.senecac.on.ca/~albert.pang/ios100/dosbatch.html)
* [How to Write a Batch File](http://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Batch-File)
* [Windows Powershell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell)


##**Pre and post build steps**

If you are using Visual Studio, you can make full use of the pre and post build steps when compiling your code. These are *invaluable* tools and you should never underestimate how useful they can be. If you need to make sure that certain include files are copied to the right path before a build, or if you need to place certain assets into a data folder after a build, the the Pre and Post build steps are the place to do that! Combined with good use of batch files (as mentioned above) you can really automated pretty much your whole build pipeline.

The ultimte goal of refining your build processes is to have it so that you can setup, build/compile and then run or debug your game from a single click or command. Aim for that goal!

###Productivity
* //TODO : Write me
* *In the mean time see this article: http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/articles/business-articles/1gam-how-to-succeed-at-making-one-game-a-month/*

###Stay positive!

This is really a difficult goal to achieve, but it is worth mentioning. A happy coder is a good coder! A couple of ways in which you can help to keep yourself motivated and happy in the work you are creating:

* Show your work to friends and family.
* Seek out feedback often and solicit suggestions.
* Ignore the negative people! - Good, critical, objective feedback is good and I would encourage you to listen to people who are being critical of your work and giving you something constructive to go on. I would definitely advise you to avoid people who are just negative or rude about your work, with nothing useful or constructive to say.
* Join gamedev communities - you are already on the right path just by being in here, but there are many other game development communities out there, TIGSOURCE, gamedev.net, etc. Go and join them also!
* Take breaks from your work when you are feeling the drain - Go outside, hang with your friends, go and see a movie, etc... anything to get your away from the computer for a few hours (or days sometimes).
* Take inspiration from others and get involved with other games developers.

Well that was a long post and I hope that it contains some useful information for you. It really gets me down seeing all the negative posts on /r/gamedev recently. Lets try to stay positive and keep this gamedev community happy and strong!

Many games (including Valve's cross-platform titles) use it already.

SDL 2.0 is a really big improvement and modernization compared to 1.2, if your game uses SDL 1.2 you should definitely upgrade. Here are some of the changes (taken from the [announcement post](http://lists.libsdl.org/pipermail/sdl-libsdl.org/2013-August/089854.html)):

&gt;
   - Full 3D hardware acceleration
   - Support for OpenGL 3.0+ in various profiles (core, compatibility,
   debug, robust, etc)
   - Support for OpenGL ES
   - Support for multiple windows
   - Support for multiple displays
   - Support for multiple audio devices
   - Android and iOS support
   - Simple 2D rendering API that can use Direct3D, OpenGL, OpenGL ES, or
   software rendering behind the scenes
   - Force Feedback available on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux
   - XInput and XAudio2 support for Windows
   - Atomic operations
   - Power management (exposes battery life remaining, etc)
   - Shaped windows
   - 32-bit audio (int and float)
   - Simplified Game Controller API (the Joystick API is still here, too!)
   - Touch support (multitouch, gestures, etc)
   - Better fullscreen support
   - Better keyboard support (scancodes vs keycodes, etc).
   - Message boxes
   - Clipboard support
   - Basic Drag'n'Drop support
   - Proper unicode input and IME support
   - A really powerful assert macro
   - Lots of old annoyances from 1.2 are gone
   - Open-source using the zlib license (instead of SDL 1.2's LGPL)
   - Many other things!

The site's wiki has a handy [migration guide](http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.fcg/MigrationGuide) as well, since many of SDL's APIs have changed significantly between versions 1.2 and 2.0.

My goal with these tutorials is to introduce developers to 2D development in Unity by utilizing Futile. Futile differs from other 2D frameworks in that it is code-centric, as opposed to utilizing the Unity editor. I briefly talk about that as well as provide a general introduction to Futile in the first post, and in the second I take you through a basic setup. You do not need any pro/paid version of Unity to proceed.

I plan to move pretty fast with these, so I hope to have the next one up within the next 24 hours. I'll be talking about loading and managing art assets. After that we're going to jump into the hello world of game development: Pong! I want to first walk developers through a basic version of Pong, and then slowly add features such as ball trails, abilities (invisible paddles, ball splitting, etc), and we'll see where it takes us. Depending on how that goes, I may consider another tutorial series for a different type of game.

This is the course for you! Learn how to make games, going from Pong to a simple roguelike in the free and awesome game engine Unity, with the C# scripting language (Javascript and Boo users can still follow along, but it might be more confusing).

This course will mostly focus on the broader aspects of game development in general, which can be used with any toolset as long as you make games, but by the end of the course you will be very competent with Unity and C#. 

The course will start on Wednesday, April 10th, 2013. 

The videos will be hosted here: http://www.youtube.com/user/NachosGames

The general structure here is:

- Pong 
- Asteroids
- Galaga 
- A simple platformer
- A simple Roguelike/RPG. 

I'm trying to keep all the videos below 15 minutes, and I'm not 100% sure how many videos it will take to make each game. 

Some programming experience would help, but is not necessary. Being at an experienced or expert level with computers would be nice.

This course will be done on a Windows PC, but Unity is available for Mac, and can be run with Wine on Linux (You'll have to learn how to do that on your own, sorry. However, if you're running Linux, you probably already know how to install programs with Wine.)

I'm not professionally a game developer or anything, I'm a web developer, but I am competent with Unity and various programming languages, and I love teaching things that I enjoy as a test of my own knowledge!

Randy Gaul (whom you might know from his [Game Programming Primer](http://www.randygaul.net/2013/01/06/game-programming-primer/)) has written us a tutorial series about building a 2D physics engine for games.

The final part also includes a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tutsplus/ImpulseEngine) of the engine, in C++, so you can dissect it and modify it as you please.

It gets pretty advanced by the end. I hope you enjoy it! Let us know if you have any questions or comments.

This series of posts attempts to explain and demystify the process as much as possible, explaining in detail how to perform the most common 2D game math problems.  Hopefully it helps you understand each concept, but worst case, it gives you code you can simply use as is.

For each recipe, there is a running application, a break down of just the math involved (as code).  That is followed by a description of how/why things work, then the complete source code for the application.  Each demo is written in JavaScript using the EaselJS library, but the code is easily ported to C, C++, Java or C#.  If you know any of those languages you will be easily able to make sense of the provided code.  There are even pretty pictures... ok, well, there are pictures.

As of right now there are 6 topics covered and a table of contents showing all of the samples running on a single page.  They include:

The code is written to favor readability over performance, so there are plenty of opportunities for optimization, some of which are mentioned in the comments or description.  The code is also heavily documented in addition to the description, or you can just read the math related bits if you prefer.

I don't know why exactly it is that I had never finished a game before, but a large reason was knowing that I could. I knew everything I would have to do, so where was the fun in that? Also, I didn't want to make a simple game that, well, sucked.

I had bigger and better ideas, no time to waste on silly things!

Then I started feeling like a sell-out, one of those people who talks about doing things but has never really done it themselves.

Finally I pulled my thumb out of my anti-mouth and sat down to do this thing.

Using the LÖVE engine and various other tools (below) I managed to complete a mostly-playable game in the 8 hours I assigned myself.

I learnt how to code in Lua, how difficult it is to get good ""feeling"" music for a game, how difficult it is to judge the brightness of your screen against others, likewise with the volume of your sounds...

I'm sure I still haven't got it right, but we all have to start somewhere.

I finally did it, and it feels awesome. I can't wait to start my next one...

Thoughts?  I'm kinda mixed on this, since while it will definitely deter people from putting up fake games or making them put in more effort, I'm not sure about requiring developers to pay a fee just for a *chance* to be released on Steam.

In my years of game design, I've never really worried about having the right sound effects since my experience designing has gone hand in hand with my sound design studies. Well, talking to a few people made me realize that decent sound effects are hard to come by cheaply or freely. Which is ridiculous because it's so simple to make them.

What I have here is a pack I made of over 200+ interface sound effects I made hoping to help a few of you pros and amateurs alike. When creating these sounds, I had PSX era RPG's in mind but I'm sure it'll work for many other games. They kinda have an upbeat feel to most of them so it won't work for your average Slender clone but see what you can do with them.

This pack contains Confirm Tones (going forward in a menu), Back Tones (going back in a menu), Cursor Tones and Error Tones (when an action cannot be completed, like clicking on a grayed out ""Load Game"" when no saves are present).

I have them split into different styles, with multiple patterns per style. Example: Confirm Style 1 has 7 different patterns. And there are 6 different confirm tones! The pack comes in two flavors: WAV and OGG.
Uncompressed, the WAV is 224MB and the OGG is 18MB. 

Links are at the bottom, hope you enjoy these!

**TL;DR -**
Made a pack of interface sounds. Here's some examples. Note, each audio file goes through just the first pattern of each style.

Every now and then, I see a question pop up here that I think, ""hey, I might be able to answer that!"" And inevitably, I see that the commenters have already done a good job covering what I would've said.

But then, another post pops up, and I think, ""ooh! I wrote about that once, too!"" And again, my sluggishness keeps me from doing any more than echoing wise words.

I want to help, though!

You see, I used to be a game dev at BioWare, and I took the indie plunge about two years ago. And a lot of that plunge was made possible by the generous info-sharing of such folks as [Andy Moore](http://www.andymoore.ca/), [Farbs](http://www.farbs.org/), and [Jeff Tunnell](http://makeitbigingames.com/). Their collected wisdom gave me both courage and knowledge to move forward with my plans.

Because of their help, I *really* wanted to do a blog of my own. To pay the favor forward, so to speak. So I did, and have done for over two years now. I have lots to share! And it's free!

It's a lot to read, though. Most people don't have the time to sift through two-plus years of bi-weekly musings. So in the interest of making it easier to window shop the contents, I thought I'd post here with a few of the more popular topics:

* [Indie Development and Money](http://gamedevgonerogue.blogspot.ca/2011/03/indie-develoment-and-money.html) - Considering making the jump to becoming an indie? This post talks about expenses, timing, and funding, in an effort to help prospective devs figure out what they need to proceed.
* [Life as an Indie](http://gamedevgonerogue.blogspot.ca/2011/12/life-as-indie.html) - What does a typical day look like for an indie? How do I handle vacation and working hours? How do I stay on task? What does my work area look like? Also, some readers might be interested in [Day One as an Indie]
(http://gamedevgonerogue.blogspot.ca/2011/05/day-one-as-indie.html), my first full-time workday away from the world of AAA.
* [Motivations for Becoming an Indie Developer](http://gamedevgonerogue.blogspot.ca/2011/09/indie-developer-survey-results.html) - Two years ago, I ran an informal survey asking indies why they decided to become indies, and the rest why they haven't yet. The aforementioned link shares the results of [this survey](http://gamedevgonerogue.blogspot.ca/2011/08/motivations-for-becoming-indie-game.html), and includes my observations on those results.
* [Starting Your Business](http://gamedevgonerogue.blogspot.ca/2012/01/2012-broadcasting-from-apocalypse.html) - In this post, I collect all the info I had accumulated about starting a business. I try to break it down into an easy to-do list, too, including registration processes, name requests, licensing, and government business resources. And while it's specific to BC, Canada, the steps probably overlap many North American processes substantially.
* [Indie Business Administrivia: The Pre-Flight Checklist](http://gamedevgonerogue.blogspot.ca/2012/02/indie-business-administrivia-pre-flight.html) - Speaking of starting a business, this post takes a step back, and covers a broader range of business questions you should be considering before going indie. Questions about such things as your payment provider, website features, and strategies for pricing, marketing, and DRM (or not).
* [Sales, Matrics, and Doing the Right Thing](http://gamedevgonerogue.blogspot.ca/2012/04/sales-metrics-and-doing-right-thing.html) - Wonder what your first month of sales will look like? This post shows one possibility (that of [NEO Scavenger](http://bluebottlegames.com/main/node/2)'s launch), along with some of the driving forces behind the graph. It also talks about analytics for the game and site. And the final section is the first of many discussions on permadeath, save games, and design. (see next item)
* [Thoughts on Game Design and Vision](http://gamedevgonerogue.blogspot.ca/2012/10/thoughts-on-game-design-and-vision.html) - Permadeath is a thing in NEO Scavenger, and this has been the cause of much discussion. ([Much](http://bluebottlegames.com/main/node/994), [much](http://bluebottlegames.com/main/node/994?page=1#comment-4255) discussion). The interrelation of permadeath with game design, saves, and randomness is an evergreen topic with interesting challenges and opportunities.
* [On Public Relations](http://gamedevgonerogue.blogspot.ca/2012/04/on-public-relations.html) - This post is entirely on the topic of interacting with players and the public. In it, I talk a bit about my PR policy, and how I deal with both positive and negative feedback.
* [The Frugal Indie](http://gamedevgonerogue.blogspot.ca/2012/05/frugal-indie.html) - Years of living without a reliable income have helped me whittle my living costs down, and I try to share as many tips as I can here.

1371471364.0,316,self.gamedev,1giewv,Breaking into game design: Part 1 - find your mountain [x-post from r/gamedesign],366,50,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1giewv/breaking_into_game_design_part_1_find_your/,"Before I left to work on [Enhanced Wars](http://quarterspiral.com/#Home), I was a producer and manager at BioWare's San Francisco office. The majority of my time at BioWare was spent as a producer leading the Dragon Age Legends game team. During my most crunched state I had a team of 25, 19 of whom I managed directly. Hiring truly takes a team to do right (and I was lucky to have a strong team at EA between the fantastic HR department and my colleagues at BioWare) but one of my primary responsibilities during that time was to serve as hiring manager for a number of positions across game design, art and engineering.


Since I left BioWare, I have turned to community participation on Reddit and forums to fill the hole in my life where co-workers used to be. Since my two partners in crime on Enhanced Wars are in different time zones I don't have a lot of water cooler conversation. So, I hang out on threads trying to add value by lending my advice to current and prospective game developers. 


I find myself repeating a few pieces of advice over and over again about how to break into the industry as a game designer. I thought it would be valuable to take my perspective as a hiring manager and turn it into a series of articles about how to position yourself best to land that first gig.


*A big caveat - I am just one hiring manager with one perspective. Each company you are trying to work for and person you are trying to impress is different. These tactics would definitely work if you were trying to land a job on my team. Personal mileage may vary.*


**Step 1 - find your mountain**
In 2012 one of my favorite authors, Niel Gaiman, [gave a commencement speech at The University of Arts in Philadelphia](http://www.uarts.edu/neil-gaiman-keynote-address-2012). It was filled with incredible advice for guiding your creative career. The first step in any game designers journey can taken directly from that speech:


&gt; ""Something that worked for me was imagining that where I wanted to be ... was a mountain. A distant mountain. My goal.
&gt;
&gt;And I knew that as long as I kept walking towards the mountain I would be all right. And when I truly was not sure what to do, I could stop, and think about whether it was taking me towards or away from the mountain.""


This is important because game design is a broad profession. In any given day working on [Enhanced Wars](http://quarterspiral.com/#Home) I might write a design document. I might wireframe some UI or spec out a UX flow. I might tweak tuning values in a spreadsheet all day long or lay out levels. I might do narrative work or write copy for menu screens. I might spend all day fixing bugs in scripting files. I might plan out a monetization strategy.


This list doesn't come close to defining all that goes into the bucket of game design. Even more important than tasks is genre and platform of game you want to work on. For instance, if Enhanced Wars folded and I wanted to get a full time job, I would feel confident applying for monetization design jobs on mobile games tomorrow. But if I decided it was time to build 3D levels for AAA games on the PS4 and Xbone, I would need to spend a minimum of 6 months preparing before I could apply for that job from a space of confidence.


Your mountain will change many times over the course of your career. New opportunities will arise, new platforms will take shape and new genres will be invented. But it is important to pick an early goal. Because applying for a level design job on Tom Clancy's The Division is fundamentally different from applying for a UX design job on Battlefield 4 is fundamentally different from applying as a generalist designer with a small mobile startup company.


Do your research and figure out what sort of job you will want to pursue as a designer. My best advice - look at job postings on Gamasutra and the websites of companies you admire. Read about the actual requirements, roles and responsibilities for real design jobs. Invariably you will find yourself saying ""that sounds like a lot of fun"" or ""I would hate to do that every day for the next 3 years."" 


And a word of advice, don't set your mountain as Creative Director. Not at first. I know it is everyone's dream to be The Guy or The Gal leading a game's creative vision. But if you find that the only jobs that appeal to you are those with a fancy title and 10+ years of experience required, you are in for a rude awakening. If the years of backbreaking work it will take to climb the mountain are not inherently rewarding, you will never never make it to the top.


Once you have found your mountain, you will be ready to start building your design portfolio, which I will cover in the next article in this series.",,False,,t5_2qi0a,False,,,True,t3_1giewv,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1giewv/breaking_into_game_design_part_1_find_your/,

- You will only get ~6,000 Yes votes organically from within Steam. The rest your must gather yourself. [[source](http://indiedevrant.tumblr.com/post/49879544051/main-points-of-valves-greenlight-dev-chat-5-7-13)]

*=This is my educated guess based on reading many articles on the subject. As the people with the current highest Yes votes get Greenlit, this number changes to suit the new highest voted left.

Consider hearing me out.

Nate (co-creator of libgdx, author of kryonet and my super best friend) and Søren (professional artist and not my super best friend), just launched their Kickstarter for Spine, a dedicated 2D skeletal animation tool. I told them it's a stupid idea when they started 6 months ago, there's Flash as well as Spriter already. As usual they ignored me. I think the outcome is worth 6 minutes of your time, watch the kickstarter video with a feature walkthrough here: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/esotericsoftware/spine

Spine's fully functional. What's missing are dedicated runtimes for popular engines, that's what the kickstarter is about. Currently only libgdx is supported, the Kickstarter should fund runtimes for Unity (Futile, 2D Toolkit), Cocos2d and Corona. You can download a trial without export functionality from the Kickstarter page for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Btw, Spine is actually written with libgdx and scene2d UI that Nate created.

Nate and Søren are only a lurkers on reddit, that's why i'm posting. I know it's not considered good form. Nate's been staying with me for the [last two months](http://www.badlogicgames.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/libgdx-annual-ski-day.jpg) and i consider him family, so maybe we can make an exception here.

Spine may or may not be for you, watch the video and judge by yourself. If you like it, consider telling others about it. If you feel it's lacking, please provide feedback. I'll have Nate and Søren answer technical and artistical questions here.

If you think it should have been called Boner or Skeletor instead of Spine, post your opinion below. I think Spine is silly.

Free demo available now, AMA!",406,107,180,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dmv87/i_have_a_kickstarter_campaign_going_on_right_now/,"Hey guys,

So this is one of those shameless self-promotions, but I've been coming here for a looong time. Last year this time I did a [post-mortem](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/rxv9s/my_new_game_48_chambers_is_out_today_thought/) on my game 48 Chambers (as well as my history in getting started making games). I was also in the very first Screenshot Saturday with my game [Take Arms](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/ffsbm/motivation_thread_show_me_screenshotsfeatures/c1fpu4h).

For the past 6 months, I've been working full-time on my 3rd game [Chasm](http://www.chasmgame.com). It's also built with XNA like my two previous games, and is being developed with our own custom tools. The game features procedurally-generated Metroid-style dungeons, so you're always guaranteed to get a little different playthough. It's super low resolution (320x180) to get that chunky SNES look, but we 4x to 720p for TVs. We took the game to GDC this year to show it off, and have that build available to check out now for free.

I've been doing development videos along the way also, so people could see how the game came together:

Past month has been hella crazy, took two weeks off work to see if I could handle full time indie development - I loved every second of it, and I feel now that I could actually do this properly and make a solid game. Just terrified of being unemployed, since it took me about a year to get my current job (as a software engineer). But it's one of those things I think I just *need* to do. If anyone has stories of going full time indie I'd be really interested to hear them.

I'm making a game in QBASIC (namely the recent 64bit port qb64.net) as a bit of a love-letter to the games I used to play when I was a bit younger. I haven't used reddit before but my brother said I should post something about my game over here; he says you guys might like this kind of thing.

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/5t7Gl.png) a screenshot of it!

I try to keep everyone up to date about my game over at my blog called [ManFightDragon](http://www.manfightdragon.com.au/) and on my twitter [@manfightdragon](https://twitter.com/manfightdragon)

If you wanna just have a look at some videos instead through there's a couple of videos of me just messing around in the engine [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y5CeldYXvo), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6wX-SjDHrU), and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkZ_GAF7Dbs), it's juuuust about to hit something I'd be happy to call ""Alpha"" but there's a few things that aren't really implemented yet.

The game runs on Windows (XP or newer), and Macs that have Intel CPUs and a whole bunch of Linux distros but I don't really know how to use Linux so I can't test it very well on there. It actually started as a pure DOS game but I ran out of resources really quickly :(

I hope you enjoy reading a little bit about my game, and definitely let me know if you want to know how anything you see actually works behind the scenes. Either way, though, thanks for your time!

Thank you so much, /r/gamedev for the amazingly supportive replies you handed out [last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/12urov/im_making_a_game_in_qbasic/) I came by here to get some opinions on what I'd been working on. I'd like to finally, formally introduce you to ""a game I've been making in QBASIC"" (as it's become most popularly known). 

I'd like to show you Black Annex.
[a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqlveWIhCFI)

I've spent the last year of my life (exactly, to the day) pouring every ounce of my ability into this game, and I feel like I have (so far) created the best thing I possibly can. I am not best artist in the world, and I'm most definitely not the best programmer on Earth, but I wanted this game to exist so I've been sitting here working on it for a long time now.

I just wanted to let you guys know it's still coming along. If you're lucky enough to be able to make it to PAXAus in July, you'll even get to have a little go at playing it. I've poured a bunch of my own money into getting a booth there to show people what I've been working on, and in a couple of days I'm sending a demo to the organizers and if they like it enough they'll give me a way bigger space for free! But I'm not sure if I'm quite at that quality yet, we have some other really great indies in Australia (it's a competition just for Indies).

Anyway, I just wanted to show you guys something that I hold dear and I feel like you've been a big part in creating.

Thankyou so much!
( I made a blog post about this too, if you like reading things! [here](http://www.manfightdragon.com/?p=445) )

Edit: Wow, thanks for all the amazingly kind words, everyone :)

Edit2:I should probably mention that the game runs on Windows(XP and up, 32 and 64bit). The Mac build is kinda broken right now, massive issues getting the mouse working and performance like a dog. I'm doing my best, though!

So, using Perlin noise as a starting point, I simulate water erosion using a particle system.

Here's the basic algorithm:

 * particles move across the terrain, always moving downhill.
 * as particles pick up speed, they erode material.
 * as particles reach flatter ground and slow down, they drop carried material.
 * if a particle cannot move downhill, it drops its material and resets to a random location.

What's cool is that from these simple rules, you can see complex behaviour like braided rivers and [overflowing and draining lakes](http://imgur.com/a/F9WVg)

Next steps are to take the eroded heightmap and apply a snowfall and wind distribution model, then it's on to making the actual game.

Today, the tutorial series was completed.",327,53,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1cmk68/a_week_ago_i_said_i_was_going_to_help_you/,"Previous thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1c46jf/im_creating_a_series_of_tutorials_for_people/

The goal of the tutorial series, specifically, is to introduce you to Futile, a free, open-source, 2D framework for Unity created by fellow redditor [MattRix](http://twitter.com/MattRix). The intent was to do this by teaching Pong. Admittedly, if I could go back and restructure the series a bit, I probably would, but overall I'm happy.

I wanted to stick purely with Futile's strength, which is rendering, so I avoided such topics like sound and AI. I do plan to cover other topics in standalone tutorials in the near future. The final product is not something read to ship and sell, but it is good enough for government work.

If you would like to see the final product:

1334847622.0,278,self.gamedev,shvri,"I run a game dev club at my college for IGF. After year 1, here is what we learned.",333,55,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/shvri/i_run_a_game_dev_club_at_my_college_for_igf_after/,"We spent our first semester running working on a 2D tile based engine while working on a level editor, as well as a game. Come our second semester, we added to our engine, rewrote the level editor, and are wrapping up on the game, which is turning out to be more of a technical demo. From our personal experience, here are some things we learned that we are going to apply next year:

1)  Get organized. Like others have said elsewhere, use [Github](https://github.com/), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [Assembla](http://www.assembla.com/), or anything like it. We used Assembla to hold all of our code because of prior experience with it. Having all of your code on something like this allows you to easily revert back to a previously saved version, which saves hours of headaches in the future, as well as easily integrates changes from multiple people quickly and efficiently.

2)  Get a task board. I suggest [SeeNowDo](http://www.seenowdo.com), again out of personal use and experience. This allows you to list all of your categories of work in things called stories. We have a story for the engine, level editor, graphics, sound, game mechanics, etc. This allows you to keep track of what needs to be done, and who is working on it! You can track hours per task, as well as list their current states like in progress, testing, blocked, etc. 

3) PLAN PLAN PLAN! If I could change one thing about how I ran things last semester and this semester, I would dedicate more time to planning. I now would rather over planning to under planning. We have gone through many changes to the game that could have easily been avoided if we had further planning. Set an amount of time for planning stages, and stick to it unless you're dying to move forward. Seriously, this should be #1.

4)  Something we've learned along the way, and have heard from industry experts, is that you should not try to rethink the wheel for **every aspect**, just one. A dev at Bioware explained to us that they wanted to make an RPG that focused on choices via interactive story. The combat and other parts of the game were really basic, nothing dramatically differed from other games, or at least they didn't plan for it to. Find a key thing to do, and do it well, knock it out of the park. If it's story, a cool game mechanic, or an awesome art style, stick with it, and build a game around that focus. That's game design 101.

5)  Be realistic. We started out wanting to do an Action-RPG, with heavy on the RPG. This turned out to be a disaster. Trying to create a large story, with many features in the game, characters, art, etc. was a bad idea; a really, really bad idea. Starting a year early gives you some time, but you need to make sure you keep realistic. Start off really small, and work your way to something larger. You'd rather have something small take longer than you thought, than something large and have to cut it like crazy to fit while you work.

6)  Do not compare your games depth to that of a AAA game release, not even to a well-known indie developer. Go look at [student games in IGF](http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entries2012_student.php), and not just the winners. Pay attention to the readings below them to see how long it took different devs to create their games. Some of our members freaked out at some of the winners, only to realize the game had been worked on for 2 years by graduate students. Don't get me wrong, set your bar high, and just realize you probably don't have a dedicated 9-5 team on your hands 5 days of the week, so you can't produce something like that. Produce the best thing you can, with what you have.

7)  Realize what you have resource wise. Every design team is different. All year long we struggled to have art done for out game. We're mostly programmers with a few artists, so it would have been a wise idea to figure out a game with a smaller art requirement that could be a little complicated programming wise. If you don't have artists, be creative and find a way to shine with what you have.

8)  If you have a large enough team, we had around 8-15 members that have been dedicated through the year, then try to assign people specific things. Instead of making someone a game mechanics programmer on the game mechanics team, make them the enemy programmer on the game mechanics team. This gives someone something specific to do, and allows someone to thoroughly know this.

9)  Have only 1, maybe 2, game designer(s). Having all of our members work on the design of the game became messy, and allowed all sorts of problems to arise. You need someone with a vision for the game, and then you need to have them produce this vision via the other members. In the best scenario, they would know enough programming, art, etc., to communicate effectively with programmers, artists, etc. As long as they can hold a vision for your focus of the game, you're golden in that respect.

I'll add more to this as I think of it or as other members of the club smack me around until I add it.

**Edit:** I run the Association of Computing Machinery's Purdue Chapter's Special Interest Group Game Development. ACM Purdue's SIGGD for short. We don't have a site up yet, but I plan to accomplish that over this summer.

You guys have helped me a hell of a lot over the past year, so I'm hoping to give something back to the community.

I'm a cognitive neuroscience graduate student, so I have a working knowledge of most of the major topics of cognitive science:  perception, executive control and attention, memory, psychometrics, etc.  I would be willing to put together a condensed ""course"" covering subsets of these topics that I find relevant to game design.

This course would most definitely include:

- Early and late attentive selection

- Visual working memory

- Multiple object tracking &amp; divided attention

- Signal detection theory

- Descriptive psychophysics (description of the major phenomena:  priming, masking, psychological refractory period, ...)

- Elementary psychometrics

- Vision, including mechanisms of spatial resolution &amp; contrast, perception vs. action, implications of optical illusions (how to exploit them for fun).

In any case, I just wanted to gauge the level of interest before pouring in the blood, sweat and tears!  If there are any other topics that I haven't mentioned, please feel free to suggest them in the comments.

If this doesn't seem interesting or appropriate, just downvote and I'll go away =)

**EDIT:**  This seems to be a welcome enterprise!  I'm currently wrapping up my finals for the semester, so I'll get started on the first part sometime after this coming wednesday.  I'll be publishing these articles on my [dev blog](http://projectorbit.blogspot.com) both in order to traffic-whore and because I can easily include diagrams and pictures.

By all means, however, continue to post comments in this thread.  Again, if you have particular interest for a topic not included on my short list, please make it known!

**EDIT 2:**  I'm not a statistician, but I thought it might be a good idea to include some very rough guidelines for the application of statistics to psychometric data.  Such guidelines are admittedly data-agnostic, but the examples will certainly draw from behavioral data.  What do you guys think?

*Tip : Disable Aero, it's often an option of your capture software.*


**EDITING**

That's basically **cropping &amp; trimming** you can do both through a video software or a photo software. I would recommend doing that using a video tool, it's more ergonomic. Go with [**VirtualDub**](http://www.virtualdub.org/), it's a great tool for this job.

Size is important, there are several ways to reduce it. The first thing to do is **resizing your video/gif** there's no way you are going to make a 1280x1024 gif. Next thing i would do is **reducing the palette from 256 colors to something lower**, if that's not enough and you are using Photoshop **play with websnap &amp; lossy slider**. And finally the last sad thing to do is to **reduce the framerate**, i wouldn't go below 20 fps.

*Note : Photoshop has a little dropdown menu ""Optimize to file size..."" that's pretty cool.*

*Note 2 : While gif does part of the compression by difference between frames, when you want to actually edit the file it has to generate each single image and it can takes huge amount of memory.

---

*I have promised to write a post-mortem on the [Strike Suit Zero Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/43153532/strike-suit-zero) for a while now. I haven’t done so for many reasons, but the main one was that I wanted to have the game out and most of the rewards delivered before doing so. The fact that the game has been released is one of the most interesting points here, and a good way to get a complete view of what the Kickstarter did for the game beyond the campaign.*
 
For lots of reasons outside of my control as well as the studio’s, I won’t be able to share sales number for the game. It is unfortunate but hopefully, there will be enough to learn from here to still make it valuable.
 
As a short side note, I probably need to clarify my role with the studio: I am a Non-Exec Director of Born Ready Games and worked as an executive producer for the title (not hands on, providing on-going feedback on the project). ICO has been providing the PR for the game in Europe since it was first announced (back in 2011).
 
**The Campaign**
 
Back in September last year, the studio realised that while the game development was progressing fast, it wouldn’t be possible to finish it in the timeframe allowed by its cash in the bank. After discussing different options, we decided to take the issue to the existing community (while it was small, it was there and had been built for the past 3-4 months) and see if crowdfunding could help fill in the cash gap needed to finish the game and add some polish.
 
The campaign was launched on the 18th of October with a $100,000 objective. It was successfully funded on the 17th of November, with a total amount pledged of $174,804 from 4,484 backers.
 
The game itself was released on the 23rd of January 2013.
 
During the campaign, different additional content was promised, either in the initial campaign or through stretch goals:
 
- The Marauder Strike Suit – DLC for a different Strike Suit ship. Added to the game on the 23rd of March 
- The Heroes of the Fleet – DLC of 5 additional missions. Added to the game on the 20th of May 
- The Mod tool (as a $130,000 Stretch goal). Available on Steam since the 20th of May. 
- The Oculus-support beta (as an optional add-on for a symbolical $1). It has started last week for some of the Kickstarter backers.
- The Mac and Linux support. The stretch goal wasn’t met (barely, it was at $180,000 and  the PayPal pledges didn’t add enough to meet it) – so the studio decided to support it but not as a simultaneous launch, as promised in the stretch goal. Mac beta has just started last week.
 
Overall, the studio has nearly completed the project it was raising money for and it will be all done before the end of the summer.
 
 
**What worked and what were the unexpected  benefits**
 
These are just not mine – I asked Benjamin and Chris from the studio to contribute to this list:
 
1. Good planning. Ahead of the campaign, we took a lot of time to research other similar projects (scope and theme) and it helped a lot to create the campaign as well as during the campaign itself. Obviously, it wasn’t perfect as the next chapter proves, but it would have been way worse without all the prep.
 
2. Dedicated resource. Jamin (the studio’s community manager) was on the campaign full time; talking to the backers, working on updates, keeping track of requests and questions.
 
3. Involving the team in the campaign. Getting them in the video and the updates was good for morale but also showed the identity of the studio.
 
4. Excellent PR impact. 47 (in the US) and ICO (in Europe) were managing the PR for the game at the time and the coverage the game got during the Kick Starter campaign accelerated massively.. I don’t think that back then being on Kickstarter was a story in itself already, but it helped support one of the key message : space dog fighting games were once huge and needed to be more represented). Word-of-mouth supported this a lot obviously, some backers asked some media that had not been covering the title to talk about the game and they did. “Game X goes to Kickstarter” is not a story anymore, but if you do have a story to go with your campaign, it will make it possible for the message to spread more easily.
 
5. Joysticks. I mentioned this at events where I am talking about the campaign, but the addition of the Logitech joysticks during the campaign created a mid-campaign push thathelped a lot. Just check the numbers below. I think backers loved the idea of having a joystick again (tapping in the same nostalgia sentiment that exists for the genre) – and the game was perfect to play with a joystick.
 
6. Studio financial health. Without the Kickstarter money, I have no doubt that the game would have been released, but in a poor state (it was still a bit rough and some may say it still is, so imagine what would have happened) and it would have been at the cost of  redundancies or  possible worse. The extra money then was essential not just to get a better game out, but to give the studio enough rope to release it properly. It is now in a much better shape and was able to self-finance the stand-alone score chaser based on Strike Suit Zero for instance (Strike Suit Infinity).
 
7. Junji and Paul were ace. Junji Okubo is the mecha designer behind the Strike Suit and the ships design. Paul Ruskay is the composer of the music. They both gave us incredible support. Paul waved some of his rights to the music for the rewards of the Kickstarter campaign. Junji offered to design mechas for the $10,000 rewards (that nobody backed, but were still really awesome). They also both shared the word about the game and the campaign. I don’t think it is a coincidence that the highest average pledges came from Japan for instance ($80 per backers on average, compared to $40 for the rest of the world).
 
8. Merch. An unexpected benefit of the campaign was the sudden access to a number of merchandise opportunities. While the studio hasn’t made any plans to sell them for now, having artbooks and OST CDs is a nice thing. Meeting with potential partners, being able to give the artbook and say “this is the art style of that game we made” makes it easier to break the ice.
 
9. Team morale. I couldn’t judge from this first hand, but everyone mentioned to me how it boosted the team’s spirits. Going from “working on a game we think is cool” to “working on a game that people think is cool enough to support” does miracles.
 
 
**What went wrong and unexpected problems**
 
1. Paypal. It went live way too late and was difficult to manage. It was put together in a rush and nobody in the studio had proper experience with it. This was a missed opportunity and had we had it up and running earlier the impact on teh overall campaign could have been much larger.
 
2. Lack of some skills within the studio. Nobody in the studio has experience putting websites together. The game’s website was a placeholder (and a bad one) for most of the campaign and when the main one went live, it still wasn’t a good website. The current site is much better, but it was needed most back then, when backers were researching the game beyond its Kickstarter page. It probably didn’t help  build up the credibility of the project.
 
3. Stretch Goals. Because the campaign was to finish the project, not to start it, the studio had very little flexibility on what could be offered as Stretch Goals. When you go to Kickstarter to fill in a gap in your finance to finish the game, you really don’t want to offer to add XYZ that will delay your game again. It limited the capacity for the studio to push for more funds beyond the initial goal. It is still great that the Mod tool could be added as this was a much demanded feature by the community. In retrospect though, maybe more things could have been added, I think we may have been overly cautious there.
 
4. Unprepared for the Kickstarter back-end. While this wasn’t the biggest of issues as SSZ wasn’t a multi-million campaign, it was still a massive pain. Larger campaigns that have plans to transition backers from Kickstarter to their own backend are really in a better shape to tackle all the requests and micro-management required. The Kickstarter back-end will do so much for you, you need to find your own tools and you usually learn the hard way about the ones that work and the ones that don’t.
 
5. OST CDs. While I think the rewards were well structured and generally working, I will raise my hand for this one and say “I fucked it up”. We limited the OST CDs to a quite high level ($250), while production of those meant we were going to get a lot more than what the backers would need. Like 950 more than needed out of 1,000 CDs produced. We should have kept the signed CD at that relatively high level and offer un-signed CDs at a lower level.
 
6. T-shirts and hoodies. While the Insert Coins folks were super supportive, we ended up withtons of delays on the T-shirts. Actually, some have still not been sent as with some sizes, we had quality issues. It mostly comes from inexperience with managing these kind of products – and the delays with them.
 
7. Pricing. When planning the campaign, we knew the retail price was going to be about $20 and we thought we had prepared that way. We offered the game at $15 for the early bird backers (limited to 1,000) and at $20 as the first price point where you can get the game otherwise, with a few, very anecdotal perks. BUT – when launching on Steam, you usually do a discount, in our case this was 20% off, meaning the game was at $16 at launch… That went way over our heads back when planning (and while we did research what other projects have done, very few had launched and encountered this issue – I now know that others ran into the same problem) and we got criticized by some backers, who were feeling that they were being punished when they had backed the project before anyone and should been treated better. It felt even more painful as they felt the game was almost ready before the campaign and would have launched without their support (they were wrong on this, but that was their perception). There was also strong support from another part of the backer community which answered  the criticism better than the studio could have and basically said they were fine with what happened with the pricing as “Kickstarter is about crowdfunding, not about pre-ordering projects on the cheap”. The plan had always been to be generous and to go beyond what had been promised as rewards, and hopefully it has shown, at least in a small way, with the studio offering discount codes for the new content to the backers for instance. The idea was always to keep backers happy – and the studio has  this very much in mind.
 
8. Rewards system in Kickstarter. We always knew that we would not be able to edit the rewards after the campaign was launched, and we still made the rookie error of referencing some content as “and all previous rewards”. That meant that when we added the joystick, many backers expected to get this when backing higher level rewards, despite explaining it wasn’t the case at different points on the page. I definitely recommend going with the current best practice to name the rewards and reference them by that name when you need to.
 
9. Kickstarter documentation. There are quite a few things that you need to learn as you do them on Kickstarter. The way surveys work and advice on how to maximize their use could use some love on the documentation side. Nowhere on the site (it was true back then and it is  still true now) are you  told that after the campaign YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE MAIN PAGE ANYMORE… When you were able to reflect a lot of things moment to moment on it, losing this ability over night, without notice, is a big issue. It didn’t create many problems with SSZ, but it was very annoying. I did mention this to Kickstarter and I suspect they are working on a way to address this while protecting the information that was historically provided to the backers before the end of the campaign and avoid scamming.
 
 
Overall, the Kickstarter had a positive net benefit for the project and the studio, no question about that.
 
 
**The numbers and graphs**
 
I love numbers and graphs (you should know that by now), so let me share loads with you:

- Duration of the campaign – 30 days
- Number of backers who pledged money during the campaign – 4,484
- Number of backers whose payment actually went through – 4,458
- Payment that failed – 26
- $ amount pledged – $174,804
- $ amount paid – $173,872
- $ amount that failed to be paid – $932 
- The failure ratio was incredibly low for the project. No complaints here. The nice folks at Kickstarter said it was generally 2 to 3% of the payment that were affected on average.
- Number of backers choosing “No rewards” – 18 (for $335)
- Number of countries represented by the backers – 56
- Number of countries represented by the backers with physical rewards – 25
- Number of backers with physical rewards – 631
- Number of joysticks sent – 386

Pledges for physical rewards making 41% of the money raised is nothing to scoff at.

The Kickstarter system does send you an email whenever something related to your project happens. It can be overwhelming if you don’t expect it:
 
- Number of “Kickstarter” emails received during the campaign – 6462
- Number of pledges cancelled – 238
- Number of pledges decreased – 138
- Number of pledges increased – 564
- Number of official updates during the campaign – 21
- Number of comments during the campaign – 480
 
That’s about one comment per 10 backers. The project being a ‘help us finish our project’ rather than “help us start our project”, the engagement with the user was quite different. I would expect more comments and more discussions between backers in a “starting a project” campaign.
 
- Number of direct messages during the campaign – 228
- Number of “Kickstarter” emails received after the campaign (over 7 months) – 1621
- Number of official updates after the campaign – 22
- Number of comments after the campaign – 751
- Number of direct messages after the campaign – 842
- Number of views for the Kickstarter video – 74,822
- On Kickstarter – 63,108
- External – 11,774
 
About 11% of the views watched the video to the end. Not bad, especially as those numbers are current numbers, many months after the campaign is over I suspect views have accumulated during the period after the campaign.

- Artbooks production costs – £3,307 / $5,162

- Number of 3D printed Strike Suits sent – 0
- 3D printed Strike Suits production costs – £450 / $702 
- Total postage cost (to date) – £1,653 / $2,580
 
Because the joysticks were managed differently through Logitech, the postage costs doesn’t include them. For reference, the studio sent 385 joysticks around the world – and it cost £3,981/$6,221 all included.
 
There are still a few things to send (T-shirts mostly) and the final costs for the 3D-printed figures (and their postage) won’t be final until it is actually done, but at the moment, the studio has spent £17,062/$26,641 for the physical rewards. That’s 15.2% of the total raised spent there. Compared to other campaigns, this seems reasonable and within what was expected.
 
I shared in the past the following graph, that is showing the impact of the campaign on the number of new likes on Facebook: http://imgur.com/xLVDswf
 
 
 
The orange marks are for consumer events (Rezzed, gamescom and Eurogamer Expo), the blue marks are the release of videos (developer diary, Pax Trailer, and a feature on Athene’s channel) and the grey marks are positive articles in some media. Of everything that was undertaken in terms of communication and marketing (and arguably, this being an indie project, there weren’t a large budget allocate to these), none had an impact comparable to the Kickstarter campaign. As I mentioned before, the website at the time wasn’t very well done and we drove all the traffic towards the Facebook page, so this is the best way to measure the campaign impact comparative to other things that were done.
 
But that’s an incomplete (and old) picture, so here are is another one, reflecting the effect of the launch of the game: http://imgur.com/stdxZWz
 
 
 
Because the time period covered is much longer, I opted for a different graph format. You can still see the impact the Pax Trailer had, but it all pales compared to the launch of the game. I don’t have much to add here, if only to say that the release of the second game seemed to have a much stronger impact on acquiring fans than the launch of the first game. I suspect that the commitment of the studio to create more content is what created this effect, but I have no evidence of this. The Facebook promotion that was running at the same time had a role to play as well, but looking at the numbers very closely, it was marginal compared to the release of Strike Suit Infinity itself.
 
Ideally, I would conclude with sales numbers and compare them with the numbers  from the campaign to draw even better conclusion, but as said in introduction, we can’t. What I can say is that thanks to the Kick Starter campaign, the  studio is still around and that, in the end, the backers, so critical in getting the game finished and released, ultimately represent a relatively small proportion of people who are now enjoying the game.

We get asked the ""what engine"" question every week, and we always say there needs to be a sidebar item, but we don't have one yet. 

Why now? Because I'm starting a new project, and find myself wondering the same thing. I've found that it's hard to get objective information on any engine out there right now, and although the best option is to try a bunch of engines and see what fits, I'd rather make games than evaluate engines. 

So, here's what I need from you fine chaps:

I want information about the engines that you've used IN THE PAST YEAR. Not that older experience doesn't matter, but I want this list to be as up to date as possible. 

Here's the data I need:

* Engine Name

* Platforms it will deploy to

* 2D or 3D

* Language used to develop for it

* How active is the community

* How good is the documentation

* What does it cost? Licensing options? 

* Commercial games made with the engine? 

* What does it do well? 

* What are its short falls?

As part of the Masters program I get an orchestral recording session on the Warner Bros. scoring stage (48 pieces!).

For me this is great but it is also really great for any indie developer since the sound of live instruments is just amazing. At the moment I'm just trying to find said game to write an awesome score for. So I thought I would post here and see if anyone is interested. Or if you know of anyone who is looking for a professional score, you could put them in touch with me. Because I think this situation is win-win for both parties. Also ideally the project would be near completion.

In terms of game composing experience, I'm experienced with both Fmod and Wwise (moreso with Wwise at the moment), and I've scored an iOS game that will be released this summer. Anyway, if you're interested just post here or PM me. Here is my soundcloud page, where you can check out some of my previous work: https://soundcloud.com/jordan-gagne.

And if you don't think orchestra is right for your project, feel free to contact me anyway as I am always looking for cool projects to work on.

Want a new tile? Well just draw it where you want and the tool automatically manages the tilesets for you offscreen. You can also edit multiple tiles at once.

Want to create an object? Well just draw the pixels, select them and you have an object you can move around, copy and edit.

- Linq performance sucks. Nothing sucks more than Linq performance in situations where speed is of the essence.

- So does string +=. Use stringbuilder.append instead.

- Dictionaries and standard arrays are your friend.

- Make your own random class and make the maximum value inclusive. This will save you so much time when programming and reading code.

- For heaven’s sake, download VSCommands for visual studio.

**(General stuff)**

- Telling your friends and family about the game you’re making does not demotivate you ([as seems to be the general consensus](http://www.2knowmyself.com/why_you_should_keep_your_goals_to_yourself)). Instead, they will nag you so much that you won't be able to just give up.

- Read as much as you can about techniques, algorithms, etc. Even if they don’t apply to you, you will teach your brain to think differently about your own stuff.

- You may have experience with the language, but making a game is a whole new sport. You know nothing.

- ~~8gb of ram is actually... not that much.~~ People are having issues with this statement so I removed it. All I meant is, don't expect memory to be this infinite resource. If you're doing a lot of reckless looping and calculations on very large collections (lists, arrays, etc) you're gonna have a bad time.

- Keep a notebook handy. Jot down whatever comes to mind when it does. Especially helpful if you travel by bus a lot, or have a lot of idle time in your life.

- There’s so many ways you can do things; don’t be afraid to try it your own way.

- Git (or any other version control) is your best friend. 

- If you’re not backing up your code on some remote location you’re gonna have a bad time.

- Split and re-use. It’s easier to traverse through a couple of methods and fixing once than it is to read through a 1000 lines and then fixing the same piece of code wherever it occurs.

- Don’t be afraid to ask. /r/gamedev is amazing.

I wanted to get some insight from the community on r/gamedev on your thoughts.

I think knowing what percentage of consoles on the market are owned by devs compared to that of units owned by consumers would help explain some of these numbers. As it's likely there are a lot of indie devs who own the Ouya, but don't have the time or money to be making purchases.

[Here](http://indiestatik.com/2013/07/22/ouya-stats/) is some additional info on sales though it's a few days old.

I'm curious as to everyone's thoughts on why the margin between downloads to sales is so large. Is it due to poor price points on the Ouya market, do devs need to be approaching more of a mobile pricing model? Or is it because the game selection is lacking. As devs who may have been looking to port or launch a game on the system does this change your plans?

Also, here is a [link to my original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1j2bzg/73_of_ouya_users_have_yet_to_buy_a_game_and_the/) on r/ouya for those who want to jump in on that discussion as well.

Edit: doomedbunnies has made the point that the term attach rate is not correct for the figure given in the statement by Julie. The statistic is more likely referencing a conversion rate. Though how exactly Ouya is calculating that marketing figure is still unknown.

Edit 2: doomedbunnies amended his initial statement the term attach rate in this instance is not the same as the traditional use of attach rate.

I put together a [post today on my website](http://randomseedgames.com/blog/2013/5/15/lacuna-passage-devlog-13-the-mundane-side-of-game-development) for a topic that doesn't get a lot of discussion. Basically, all the parts of game development that seem boring or slow us down. This is devlog #13 for a game I am making called [Lacuna Passage](http://www.randomseedgames.com). I have posted the main text here for your convenience.

-----------------------------------

I really struggled to come up with a topic for a devlog this week. I feared that I might have to skip a week for the first time since I started writing devlogs for Lacuna Passage. Despite lots of game-related work that I had been doing I didn’t think that any of it was interesting enough to show off. A few people suggested, “Why not write a post explaining the mundane stuff?”. So you can thank those people for this devlog... hopefully it gives you some insight into the less-than-glamorous aspects of developing Lacuna Passage.

**Managing a Team**

The sad fact of team development is that someone inevitably has to spend time “managing” the team which detracts from the amount of time they can spend actually developing the game. This means finding reference images for concept artists and modelers, critiquing finished work, assigning new work, and documenting art pipeline specifics. Believe it or not, team management requires more than just poking your head into a room and telling someone to “tighten up the graphics on level 3”.

Google Drive is a lifesaver when it comes to communicating with your team. There is no better way that I have found to share and collaborate on important documents. All of our story and art pipeline documentation is shared via Google Drive.

Another great tool for team management is [Trello](http://www.trello.com). If you haven’t heard of it I highly suggest you check it out. It is essentially an advanced to-do list. You can assign team members to tasks, set due dates, attach files and screenshots, and leave comments and feedback. It’s seriously great. Even if you work alone it is perfect for keeping yourself on task.

**Managing Assets**

When I tell people I make video games in my free time I highly doubt they picture me spending 4 hours on a Saturday night converting image formats and adding new filename prefixes. But that’s exactly what happens more often than many developers would care to admit.

The allure of quickly throwing assets into your game “just to see how they look” can be strong, but you must resist the urge. Haphazardly importing BigAwesomeRock_07, MoreBigAwesomeRock_07_new, and SeriouslyThisIsTheFinalBigAwesomeRock_07_morenew will turn your folder structure into a wasteland of assets that have you scratching your head. Sometimes I wonder what the ratio of asset production to asset management is, but I know it’s much higher than most people think (or at least it should be). I spend a lot of time ensuring that there are backups of all our files and that all those files are properly labeled according to our naming conventions (which are conveniently available for reference in a Google doc).

When an asset is finally imported into the game I make sure that it has been properly checked for quality and conforms to our import settings for scale, etc. On the (hopefully rare) occasion that an in-game asset needs to be replaced it’s a good idea to make sure that both the old and new versions are backed up in a separate folder. Once the new version of the asset is imported into your game’s working project folder you want to be sure and delete the old file so that you never use the incorrect version by mistake. It will always be in your backup files if you need to return to it.

This process of keeping your game assets properly organized can be tedious and extremely repetitive, but in the end you will be glad you had the forethought. You might have a firm mental grasp on your folder structure when your game only has a few dozen assets, but before you know it you will be swimming in hundreds of messy files.

**Bug-hunting**

I’m not sure if I can even conceive of a more annoying aspect of game development. If someone asked me how I spent last Friday evening this would be how the conversation would go:

“Hey Tyler, so you’re still working on that game of yours huh? What did you accomplish recently?”

“Oh, well just the other day I was trying to get the image loading code for the in-game digital camera working and I couldn’t figure out what I was doing wrong. After hours of pouring over my code I realized I forgot to capitalize a letter. If there was a baby nearby at the time I would have punched it.”

Absolutely infuriating. Though I suppose I should mention that I am not a trained programmer and everything I do in code is extremely amatuer (I mostly work in Playmaker), but the stories I hear from close friends who have been programming for years are fairly similar. Bugs and code errors are the bane of the game developer’s existence.

**Promotion**

Email, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, Screenshot Saturdays, press kits, Indie DB, and yes - Devlogs. I actually really enjoy promoting Lacuna Passage. It’s great to see people’s reactions to all your hard work, but it really takes a lot of time and effort to do it right. After all, even if you have the greatest game in the world it doesn’t really matter if no one knows it exists.

Just last week I spent nearly three days putting together a [press kit](http://lacunapassage.com/press/sheet.php?p=lacuna_passage) for the game so that we have an easy place for journalists to find the latest info. That’s three days that I would love to have back for improving the game, but it’s just another necessary part of the process.

After a full day of work at my 9-5 job I come home to manage team assignments, manage new assets, hunt through the previous day’s progress for bugs, do some quick rounds of promotion, and maybe - just maybe - I will have time to get some real development done. All of this I do without the promise of any pay or reward, because there isn’t anything I would rather be doing. I make games and this is what it takes.

Where do I find my audience?,305,58,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dpgfu/ive_got_a_game_its_time_to_promote_it_where_do_i/,"I've been developing [**FRONTIERS**](http://i.imgur.com/bUKANpZ.jpg) since last year and I'm ready to promote it.

My background is in filmmaking &amp; vfx, and I've only developed games privately, so I'm not really plugged in to the gaming community yet.

So my big questions are: Where do you find the audience for a game like this? How do you try to connect with them, and how do you tell if you're succeeding?

Here's where I'm at, for context:

----
- The game's in alpha &amp; being playtested. I'm guessing 4-6 months before it's finished. (That's padded since I've never done this before.)

- Windows / Mac / Linux with no plans for mobile or other platforms.

- A trailer will be ready in 2-3 weeks. I think I can cut a mean trailer, the question is where to send it and how to let them know it's coming.

- Last week I created an [indiedb profile,](http://www.indiedb.com/games/frontiers) but I'm not sure how to make use of it.

- Game sites / forums / youtube channels? Which ones should I be paying attention to? Which ones are interested in games like mine? This is where I feel the most unplugged.

- Contests? GDC? I've never been to any before. I believe FRONTIERS is a quality game, but it's not inventive or groundbreaking, so it seems like it would get lost in the shuffle.

- Kickstarter? Posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/185z1j/my_kickstarter_is_struggling_why/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/183e50/going_down_with_this_ship_my_kickstarter/) are helpful but I have no clue if my audience is big enough to support a campaign. I'm *really* eager to hear your opinions, even if it's wild speculation.

- Steam Greenlight seems like a great fit for publishing but I'd like to hear your opinions on this as well.

""But, this post is not about Zynga. This post is about how horrible I feel for all my friends, networking buddies, fellow industry peons who got left. The ladies and gentlemen who work 60, 70, 80+ hours a week for less than market pay of what they are really worth. When speaking at local colleges, conventions, and social networking events there are three questions I force those wanting to get into the industry to ask themselves.

    “Am I alright with no job security? Am I alright with being underpaid to work more hours? Am I alright with having to relocate?”.

If you answered yes to all three of those questions than you will have to deal with your decision. We all got seduced by the “glory” industry we love, Then and that is our own fault.

The companies hold all the power. We accept these conditions blindly because we get to make games, but in the end, we are making other people’s games. Even worse, most of use agree to not work on our own games while working for a company. Yes, think about it, we agree to not do what we went to school for, trained for, dreamed of doing because…why?

Graphics, music, sounds - I just can't do it. I have a friend who did great graphics for the games we made but he's no longer into that and I wonder - where do you guys get your arts from? I have a lot of ideas and a couple of working prototypes but no one will play black rectangles vs red circles on white background battles. I also find it very hard to work without any graphics because I'm discouraged by the idea that no matter how much work I put into it, it will never look good and therefore people will not play it. 

In general - where do you find your artists? And how do you work? Do you pay them for assets, or team up and share revenue? If you pay, how much does it cost?

I'm thinking about doing a kickstarter (or something similar) to fund development on [OpenGameArt.org](http://opengameart.org) (right now I work on it in my spare time and fund it mostly out of pocket, with the help of a few donations), and I'm wondering what all people would be interested in seeing me work on.  This can include new site features, more curation and organization of content, community outreach, and even pixel art (or really anything else that I don't otherwise have time to do at the moment).

I'd also be interested in hearing what sort of donation prizes people would be interested in, if I do end up going with a kickstarter model.

I'll keep an eye on this thread and answer any questions people might have.

**Note:** Of you're interested in checking out other things people have asked for in the past (most of which have been put off due to time constraints), see our [feedback forum](http://opengameart.org/forums/feedback).  Even if you want something that people have already asked for, I'd like to hear from you, just so I can gauge interest.

**Update:**  Here are the most popular suggestions so far:

* Redesign the site, or at least make the UI less clunky.
* More opportunities for users to participate (contests, Fake Internet Points, etc)
* More fine-grained categories (I think the best way to do this would be to allow user-created collections to be ""promoted"" to categories, once we know what categories people will be interested in)
* More art.  :)
* Better organization of art content (this will require someone to spend time every week manually organizing content as it comes in)
* Open source all of the OGA source code
* Let game developers submit their games, then flag all the art they're using in those games.  When you go to an art page, you see what games it's being used in, and when you click on a game, you can see a description and screenshots, and all the art being used in it.
* Have a system to make it easier to relate and remix existing art.

**Update #2:**  Some reward ideas (looking for more input):

* The usual swag (t-shirts, mugs, mousepads, etc)
* Donor gets to choose an art commission (this would have to be within certain parameters, since different types of art tend to vary in cost)
* Name a character in a game (I'd have to get a game developer to agree to this)

I've been searching around for a good YouTube vlog about game development and coming up empty. Sure, there are a bunch of developer diaries (which are great!), but they focus on such a small section of game development which is itself quite a small part of being an indie developer.

I see a void where developers more or less disappear as they lay the groundwork for a game or work at polishing/finaling a title. I fall into this trap too, though I use the usual Twitter/blog/Facebook posts to keep up appearances. So why not a vlog?

I imagine the r/gamedev group would mostly want to see game footage and all things technical, but maybe other aspects like workflow, thoughts on the industry and stories about getting started/quitting to go full time would prove relevant. It can't all be demos and tutorials!

Would you personally be interested in watching something like that? What would you want to see?

Thanks!

**edit:** Wow, that was a bigger response than I expected. A lot of different opinions overall; not a surprise that most are interested in the technical side of things. Nice to see that some would be interested in the 'human side' of things too. Won't be able to please everyone but it sounds like there's an audience for the kind of thing I have in mind.

It could have been an April Fools joke, but Valve and Yoyo have been cooperating to get GM:Studio on Steam. To summarize what admins said in the thread, Valve wanted to buy the company and all Yoyo staff members (including GMC admins) would become paid workers for Valve. They would also need to use Valve's own forums to replace the current Game Maker Community.

Okay guys, this is a big one for us to discuss.

As you all know, we at YoYo Games have been partnering with Valve and their Steam platform as a base for GM:Studio. They have supported the growing GMS community on Steam, as well as the product itself and this has led to them taking a keen interest in our Software and it's capabilities for future markets... which in turn has lead to them making us an offer.

Yes, Valve wants to buy YoYo Games and GameMaker!

You will no doubt be surprised by this (I know we are), and maybe a little bit worried about what this will mean for the future of the GMC, GameMaker and YoYo Games. Well, that's what I'd like to discuss here, as Valve have some very clear ideas about what they require from us, but they have also stated that they will be flexible and accept certain things that we propose relating to the product and the GMC. They do value the client/product interaction that we have here after all.

So what are they proposing for us here? Basically that the GMC become a part of the Steam Community and that we port the forums over to their format. this means that they will probably want to strip out all the creation forums, the Off topic forums, The GMC Jam and also the technical forums for platforms other than Windows, Mac and Linux. They are still debating about the Tutorials forums as we think they at least should be kept, but the general ""standard"" is not what they think it should be so I suspect that they too will be going, and Education will probably be expanded, with the emphasis being placed on student offers and events.

As for the staff, well Valve has asked me to communicate their gratitude to all of you, and would like the Admins to become official Steam employees on their forums (a paying position, but this will depend on independent communication with Valve. I'll be putting them in touch with each of you). Unfortunately the moderators will not maintain their position, but we at YoYo Games would like to thank you all and will be supplying you with a copy of GMS Master Edition free of charge.

I know this is a bit of a bombshell, but I hope you all understand that this is too big an opportunity for us at YoYo Games to miss. Please, feel free to discuss this here and raise any objections or suggestions that you may have, and we promise to try and communicate them to Valve for you.",,False,,t5_2qi0a,1364773840.0,,,True,t3_1bdtar,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1bdtar/valve_is_buying_yoyogames_the_makers_of_game_maker/,

We wanted to go in safe, small goal, playable demo (with easy access to it), reasonable backer rewards... well 26 hours later we are struggling to get any attention, I sent out a letter to 65 gaming news sites - 0 responses. In that 26 hours we have managed to get 284 video views and 7 backers (5 of them within first hours after launch).

We have done all the regular: Homepage, Greenlight, Demo, Facebook, Twitter, Forum posts, IndieDB... We have gotten some good response from people who have tried out the game, but I guess it is just too average of a game.

Are the news outlets avoiding Kickstarter projects because the market is so over saturated? 

Anyways we are right now preparing the game to be sent to reviewers (youtubers and other), we'll see what comes from that, but right now the ""Indie Dream"" is slowly turning into ""Indie Reality"" which is fine, definitely smarter now and in the future.

A few weeks ago I stumbled upon this thread while searching icons for a game :
http://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/ifmie/i_made_700_rpg_icons_free_for_use_for_your_game/

I was really amazed by this impressive collection and started digging in its treasures.

But I was soon frustrated by two things :

* there are so many icons that it's hard to browse them
* there only available in a 400px PNG format

So I send a quick email to Lorc, the author. He was really kind and sent me his original working copy. He had not rested on his laurels, and I discovered hundreds more icons not included in the original released! Fantastic.

I started to organize the graphics in folders but quickly figured out that it may be stupid to just let them hidden on my hard drive. They need to be easily accessible on the web in SVG.

Here's the result : [http://game-icons.net/](http://game-icons.net/)

For now my main focus was quantity, but I aim to improve the overall quality for this directory to make them easier to discover. You can learn more about what I plan to do in the about page in the footer. More icons will be added regularly.

In a few weeks, I'll start adding my own icons, steampunk flavor but keeping the same graphical aspect. Then, if anyone wants to contribute with its own set, I'll be glad to help him put them online.

1368515776.0,221,self.gamedev,1eavwx,Monster AI System Explained (Part 1 of 5),258,37,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1eavwx/monster_ai_system_explained_part_1_of_5/,"Hey everyone! Continuing from the recent success of my previous post on dungeon generation (**[Procedural Dungeon Generation Explained](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dlwc4/procedural_dungeon_generation_algorithm_explained/)**) I decided that I will post more game development articles and videos in the future to inspire the community and also hopefully promote my game [TinyKeep](http://tinykeep.com) as well!

This is the first of the multi-part series of updates about TinyKeep's AI, over the next few days I will be posting a series of videos about the monster intelligence system that I've developed for the game. Today I'm going to talk about simple roaming and chasing behaviours for a single monster. For the later parts, I'll progress to more sophisticated concepts such as Group Tactics and Rivalry.

I've posted a detailed **[YouTube video of the Roaming and Chasing behaviour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAxfnFRB1Dg)**

In a nutshell, here's how it works:

1 . A connected waypoint graph is calculated for a new procedurally generated dungeon. Generally we will have one waypoint per room (though some larger rooms may contain 2 or 3), and a few waypoints along long corridors.

2 . By default a monster will be in non-alert (roam/patrol) mode, as it's not chasing anything. So, it will use A* (shortest path) pathfinding to travel to randomly selected waypoints in the dungeon.

3 . The monster has a FOV of 90 degrees, and can only detect another entity if it is in within its FOV and direct line of sight (we use raycasting to determine if a nearby enemy is in its direct line of sight).

4 . Once an enemy is detected, it's alert level is increased to 200 and it begins chase. We use the Seek Steering Behaviour on the monster to follow its target.

5 . If the enemy escapes line of sight, the monster is still able to follow it even though it can't see it. It does this by targeting ""smell trails"" or ""breadcrumbs"" that the enemy has left behind. Again the monster uses Seek to follow the trail. Most recent trails are detected via line of sight (raycasting) and are tracked first. Trails are not detected if the monster is not in alert mode. 

This is the most important part of the AI, as it allows the monster to follow an enemy all around the dungeon even though it can't see its quarry - so if an enemy hides behind a corner the monster can still find him. The best thing about this elegant solution is that it does not need to use any expensive or complicated pathfinding, planning AI or anything like that. Neither does the monster need to have any internal representation of the dungeon layout. The player has done the hard work for the AI, by leaving behind the trail to follow.

6 . Trails decay over time (smells disappear), so eventually the monster will stop following if it hasn't seen the enemy for a while. At this point, the monster's alert level runs down. The monster is confused, looks around for a bit, decides that he has lost the enemy and goes back to the patrol routine.

7 . All the while - a handful of rays are cast (about 6) around the monster to detect nearby walls. If it exceeds a certain distance the monster is repelled from the wall using the Separate Steering Behaviour. This pretty much guarantees that monsters won't get stuck on walls, corners and other awkward features of the dungeon.


That's pretty much it!


You can have a play yourself on the interactive demo shown on the video:

MatchCraft is a match-3 game with beautiful art that gives the player control of the four elements. As the game progresses, the player gains levels, unlocks new elemental spells and earns coins to buy magical items.

What did I learn during the development of my first game? What went right? What went wrong and what I do I wish I'd have known before I started? My first source control check-in was over a year ago, but the real work spanned about five months after accounting for contract work that helped pay bills. The choice to ultimately release the game as Freemium was not an easy one, but I explain a bit of what my thought process was later. I'll update after a month with my revenue numbers.

.

*What Went Right*

***


1. **I finished a game** -  I started with a simple game concept (one that's probably been done to death) and put my own spin on it. I did this because I wanted to learn Unity and felt a simple game concept would allow me to focus on learning the tools. Knowing that I stuck with it and finished a game is something that makes me proud.

2. **I hired an artist** - I'm decent in PhotoShop but I'm no artist. I knew that if I wanted something polished and professional looking I would need to hire someone. At the very beginning I knew that I wanted Warcraft 3 / WoW style icons for the game. I contacted people from Deviant Art, various art agencies around the world, etc trying to find something I could afford. I got quotes as high as $100 per icon. Ultimately I found a great artist on a Warcraft 3 modding site. My artist Anton made hundreds of WC3 icons for the site and had exactly the art style I wanted. I provided concepts, but what he actually made was much better than I had imagined. [Screenshot - Icons](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbandiKkbx1r4rcu5o2_1280.png) 

    In the end, I paid around $1500 for art. I did quite a bit of the UI (modals, main menu, store) myself to save costs. Check out [Anton's site here] (http://antonmagdalina.carbonmade.com/)

3. **I didn't write my own tools, I used the Asset Store** - I have a CS degree and I have written game engines in the past, but my goal was to write a game not tools. Fighting the urge to roll my own tools or to heavily modify the ones I bought was probably the hardest thing for me to do. Here's a list of tools I bought or used during the creation of MatchCraft.
    * EZ Gui / SpriteManager 2 - $400 - 2D Sprites - Would buy something else, too expensive, does too much
    * GlyphDesigner - $30 - Fonts - Would buy again
    * TimelineFX - $50 - Bitmapped Particle Effects - Would buy again
    * Prime31 Assets - $Various - StoreKit, Etcetera 1, Flurry Analytics - Would buy again

4. **I used the Unity WebPlayer for feedback** - I was able to send out builds of my game to friends and family using the Unity WebPlayer. The feedback I got during this process was helpful.

5. **I used source control** - I recall one occasion where my Unity project file became corrupted and none of the scene files worked. It would have been a nightmare to rebuild the scenes from scratch, but I was able to restore to an older version from source control. GitHub gets $7 a month from me and I'm happy!

6. **I got an office outside my home** - This is a success/failure wrapped up into one point. I find it very difficult to focus on work when at home. I work better in the afternoon/evenings and my work schedule shifted to 11am-7pm. I got so much more done when I got in my car, drove to an office and sat down at the same computer that used to be at my house. Initially I thought the idea was absurd. Why would I pay for an office when I had one at home? Why would I choose to drive if I didn't have to? It turns out the drive afforded me the ability to change my mental state to one of work and to think about the tasks to complete for the day.

    The reason this is also a failure is that I ended my lease on the office space when I thought I was near completion (several months ago). This was before I discovered performance issues and started the iPhone UI. I should have stayed in the office until I shipped. The current plan is to get another out-of-the-house office as soon as possible.

7. **Checking off to-do lists** - I think one sign of a good developer is the ability to see the software problem from a few miles up. A good developer can look at one chunk of code and think through how changing it will affect something else. Having this ""mile high"" look at the game laid out in front of me also caused analysis paralysis at times. There were times where I realized just how much work was left to do and it was very difficult to figure out what elephant to eat. Making a to-do list of tasks helped because it allowed me to stop looking at the big picture and only look at what was next on the list. When overloaded mentally, to-do lists are a better at getting work done than my alternative.. taking a nap and ""thinking"".

8. **Versioned Game Save** - Honestly, my biggest fear is releasing an update and overwriting someone's hard work and all the virtual currency they've earned or purchased. I put in extra time to add a version number to my ""game save"" code so that when I release updates I can increment that number and it will ensure I don't mess up the previous version's game state. Now, of course, I could forget to update that number.. Perhaps I should figure out how to tie the version # to an auto generated build #. Bah.

.

*What Went Wrong*

***

1. **I made too many screens and themed UIs** - I would wager that I spent over 60% of my time creating and implementing the UI. I thought I would be clever and make themed skins for my game: Earth, Fire, Wind, Water. I did this, and they look beautiful, but I should have never done it. I spent way too much time doing art and not enough time creating products that could earn my business money. I avoided the trappings of creating my own tools but I fell into the comfort of designing UI (it's what I am paid professionally to do). You are your own worst enemy when it comes to time management. All of my games in the future will have two screens: the main menu and the game. 

    [Screenshot - Fire &amp; Earth](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbandiKkbx1r4rcu5o3_1280.png) | [Screenshot - Wind &amp; Water](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbandiKkbx1r4rcu5o4_1280.png)

2. **I created iPhone and iPad Versions** - Ever wonder why Angry birds was only on iPhone for so long? I don't any more! I wanted to showcase the artwork by making two different versions, but this took an extraordinary amount of time to do. If I would have simply done the iPhone version and taken advantage of the ""2x"" feature on the iPad, perhaps I could have used that extra time to make an Android version available today. Future iOS titles will be iPhone only.

3. **I didn't test early enough on the iPad 1** - I have no good explanation for this. I tested my iPad code on the iPad 3, but when I finally deployed to the iPad 1 I was forced to aggressively optimize. The iPad 1 has limited memory so all my beautiful graphics which took up precious memory resulted in me having to split my Unity project into scenes and strictly control resource loading/unloading. Managing art, sound and texture resolutions across multiple scenes in Unity was not fun.

4. **I thought I could do sound myself** - I did the sound myself, and I'm very happy with how it turned out; however, I wish I would have paid someone else to design the sound for me. Sound is somewhat foreign to me and I spent at least one week surfing the net, buying audio and editing it for my game. I spent about $400 on audio, primarily because I had to throw away a lot of sounds that I thought were good but sounded annoying after they were in my game. I finally found a great website that let you download preview tracks and it saved so much money: [Pond5.com](http://www.Pond5.com)

5. **My UI is not flexible** - My process for UI was generally: Create something in PhotoShop, slice it up and put it in the game. This made the Kindle Fire version much harder to make (it's on hold for now). My future games will borrow much more from CSS style ""sliding door"" elements that expand / repeat to fill space. All positioning should be relative to the screen edge and not absolutely placed. This should hopefully allow me to target Android at the same time as iOS.

6. **I didn't implement a 'Free Code' system** - My game is free to play but has in app purchases. I wish I would have implemented a way for me to give away product keys that unlocked portions of the game or gave away IAP so I could send out fully unlocked versions to review sites or give to friends.

7. **Analytics were an afterthought** - Analytics should have been inserted early during development. Simply adding event logging after the fact will not give me actionable information. Also, I haven't tested the analytics to my liking. I will probably abandon Flurry for future projects and create something for myself that can monitor user activity more closely. Flurry gives me great overall analytics like retention, but I'm more interested in things like finding out what state was the player's game in when they spent money?

.

*Freemium - aka - I hope I make money*

***
I had planned on MatchCraft being a $0.99 game, but there were a few factors that changed my mind:

* The sheer number of free downloads dwarfs paid apps. I have a wallpaper app that earns me a few dollars a day at $0.99 that got 25,000 downloads in one weekend of being free.

* The majority of Top Grossing apps are freemium

* My teenage family members and all their friends primarily download and play free apps, but they manage to buy IAP with things like iTunes Gift Cards after enjoying a game for a while. Kids these days don't get money or presents on their birthday, they get iTunes Gift Cards... (though match-3 demographics isn't exactly young teenagers)

* I'm just flat out curious what it would look like when compared to stats of paid apps that I have access to

When I first implemented the virtual currency ""Coins"" in my game, I inadvertently hid the fact that you could spend the in-game currency. I don't know if this was my dislike for games that were so in your face about buying their virtual coin, but after observing numerous people play the game it was clear that no one was spending the in-game currency.

**Enter Stage Left:** The blog post from the indie game devs about going bankrupt with their freemium game. After reading their post I realized that I suffered from a similar issue, simply my IAP were not easy for the user to find. Sure I had them in a section called ""Store"", but no one went to the Store! Also, there were other game modes that could be unlocked for coins, but when the user didn't have enough coins to unlock it, I did what a good UI person did and disabled the buttons. WRONG!

**My Solution:**

* **All buttons are enabled at all times** - If you don't have enough coins to perform the action, then you are presented with the option to buy more coins. Immediately I saw people using this to unlock all the game modes on the main menu.
* **Change the way main UI elements work based on context** - While playing, there was an icon that you could tap to refill your magic in exchange for some coins. The button wasn't used as often as I'd like because it was out of the way of normal game play. I removed the ""refill magic icon"" and made the big huge buttons that the players *did* use to cast spells change to a ""Refill Magic"" button when the user was out of magic. **Realize:** The same button that was previously disabled when out of magic was changed so the user could use it to buy magic. Doing this simplified the UI and made a significant difference in the amount of in-game currency that was spent.
* **Add more IAP and Virtual Currency Items** - Previously all I had was the ability to spend coins on in game items that slightly improve gameplay and the IAP were packs of coins enabling you to buy those items. I expanded the IAP offerings to include Unlock All Game Modes and a Coin Doubler. I expanded the Virtual Currency offerings to allow the user to buy level advancement with coins in the game. This lets people with currency quickly unlock new spells which I'm OK with since it's Single Player only.

.

*What would you tell other developers as they start a new game?*

***
**Choose a game topic that you will be proud to make. Plan for development to take you one month and expect for it to take you three.** - I feel like I chose this match-3 style because of inertia. I had written a basic version of ""elemental bejeweled"" in Torque2D in 2007 but scrapped it when PuzzleQuest launched. 

When I decided to make games in Unity I wanted to learn my tools, so I chose to finish this game since I had the matching algorithms already written in TorqueScript. The downside to this is that I was not as motivated early on as I should have been. ""Learning tools"" can only motivate you so much. I would have abandoned this project if it were not for the great art that my artist made. Seeing the art running on an iPad 3 gave me the kick to finish MatchCraft. I'm proud to call it my first game and I look forward to writing many more.

Press Ctrl + F10 and it'll take a screenshot of the window currently in focus, trim it, upload it to imgur, and put the url of the uploaded image in your clipboard, so you can just ctrl+v it to someone.

[Here's what this post looks like so far using the tool](http://i.imgur.com/oIVLr.png).

I'm Kevin Pybus, owner of Walvin Media. I have/had an online collaboration of devs and together we were working on a new single player FPS Z game, our first. We were in beginning stages, a lot of talk and ideas put down, the first level roughed mapped, etc. 

Then the unthinkable happened, my 3D developer died, his house destroyed by a tornado. It's been really sad and emotional for us, he was a close friend before he was on the team. It's been a couple of months now and the whole project has pretty much fallen apart. We decided to take a break to let things settle, but everyone took it pretty hard and has grew very distant since it happened and we've pretty much quit talking. The time off hurt more than it helped.

One guy, in the process of all this moved half way across the country and isn't responding to my calls or emails. Last week our graphics guy decided he couldn't handle starting back (he was much closer to our friend than the rest of us) so he quit. 

So ya, it's pretty much me now, I'm ready to get this going. I feel it would honor our friend more than just giving up, he really loved this game and put a lot of himself into it. So I'm here with a sweet back story, some pretty epic game mechanic ideas that have never been done before in the single player FPS Z game world, some rough mapping I probably can't even use, and no team. I feel like I just need to start all over, I want to keep the ideas alive for my friend but everything else needs a restart.

Please give me your advice, I really want to bring these ideas to life. I feel very overwhelmed by it all now. I need help, advice, motivation, and some luck. 

In case you're wondering if I'm a serious company, [here's the site for an RCE MMO we were also working on in HeroEngine](http://walvinmedia.com/rockwell/media/new-screenshots/).

Edit- **A run down of general advice given**

* ""Make work horses not unicorns""
   * ""If you want a make a living making games make simple games with strong community and good business sense these will always trump a flash in the pan viral hit.""

*""Facebook games for example are much maligned by gamers even here in gamedev, and browser based games (like we make) are hand waved away as being too basic and casual to even bother with, yet they make amazing income. Little casual facebook and browser based games are the best way to go. Kingdom of Loathing is a great example of a game that has hardly changed in a decade yet makes very solid income. How many people are going to be playing your phone app in 10 years? There is money in these markets. It does not mater that it is saturated because these casual markets just don't care. They want something punchy and fun.""*

* Regular job that mostly involves sitting around with no supervision.

*""Best advice is probably just to find a regular job that mostly involves sitting around with no supervision. My buddy works as a night security guard for Medieval Times, literally browses the internet on his laptop for about a half hour at a time then gets up to walk a 5 minute patrol around the premises. Repeat for a whole shift.*

*He makes peanuts, but getting paid 10 dollars an hour to work on your game and occasionally go for a refreshing nightwalk sounds like a dream to me.""*


* Make connections with local business owners

*""Make connections with local business owners that you think you could help out or form a mutually beneficial relationship. For example, you might contract a local graphic design firm to make some concept art, technical design or whatever it may be. (At least for the sake of this example.) Talk with them and develop a relationship with these people so you can build a website or work on some database or something. Some places might not be as beneficial but there are tons of places that you can just get comfortable with and circulate the wealth.*

*Making websites or what have you on the side for local businesses is a quick and easy way to build a relationship with a company. Just don't go door-to-door and at least try to get acquainted with the owner.""*

* Make General Apps

*As a current student I make about $200 a week off of Android apps. I have 12 apps which for the most part are identical code with different assets. I use sound boards and apps the send notifications when certain YouTubers post a video.*

I have only read the introduction, and so far I have found it to be clear and concise, and can see it being very helpful for anyone programming games. The best part is that it's free, although the author does sell PDF and paperback versions as well. 

The book uses the Processing language, which is almost identical to Java, but geared towards a graphics programming sandbox. You probably wouldn't make a serious game with Processing, but the syntax and concepts seem pretty straightforward to port to another language/framework.

It's been getting a fair bit of love on [reddit](http://reddit.com/r/ftlgame) although it isn't without it's detractors. Although I see their points, I have really enjoyed the game and having played it a fair bit, I could help but think there are some good lessons here for us hobby/small time game developers. Agree or disagree? Reply in the comments!



**1. Look for creative ways to simplify.**

Making a game can be pretty damn hard. Thinking creatively about how to simplify the game and mechanics makes it more likely that the game will make it to completion. Simplifying doesn't just mean making shorter levels or fewer enemies, however. What first struck me when I saw screen shots of the game was that the main screen was taken up almost entirely by the two ships. This was a space ship game with no space! There's no real maneuvering (only an abstract evade score) no sense of where these ships are relative to each other. Yet it all still works well. My imagination fills in the moving and dodging. The star chart where you choose which sector you go to is just a set of simply connected series of circles and lines. The ship's compartments are simple rectangles and there are no upstairs and downstairs.


**1b. Discrete encounters and randomness are simplifications**

FTL does give the sense of living universe with different races and pirates and whatnot but it is only a sense. What was that pirate doing before you ran into him? Nothing, the code only conjured him up when the player warped in. It it a lot simpler to program these types of situations than trying to maintain a massive open world where maybe the player and that Pirate cross paths and maybe they don't.


**2. Make dying a part of the experience**

Losing sucks. Dying sucks. One of the biggest gripes about FTL is that it's too random and/or too hard which can lead to players dying horribly through no fault of their own. FTL has taken Dwarf Fortress' ""Dying is Fun!"" approach. Barely fighting off a Zoltan cruiser only to warp near a sun can be exasperating but can also be amusing in a ""WTF can you believe what just happened?"" kind of way.


**3. Make a game that let's players tell a story**

Partially because of (2) what is happening in FTL (and happens in other games like Dwarf Fortress) is people are telling stories about their travels. It can be fun to tell and read stories about the lone crew member trying to fend off a pirate ship, while dealing with intruders, while somehow trying to cope with the damage from asteroids pelting their ship. Getting players to use their imaginations makes your game bigger and more epic than it might otherwise be.

Glorious deaths and (oh shit!) moments make for good stories. Short games make stories easier to tell (although Dwarf Fortress is a good counter example). Simplification can make it easier for players to fill in their own details. One nice thing that [Flotilla](http://blendogames.com/flotilla/) does is provide a 1-2 sentence description of each encounter which enforces the sense that you are telling a story through the journey.


**4. Allow players to mod the game (it may not be as hard as you think)**

Mods for the game are already starting to pop up. You can already fly [Serenity](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=2525) or the [Enterprise](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=2652&amp;start=1) and there are sure to be many others. For a hobby game dev this can be daunting. It's hard enough just to make the $@#$@# game, do I have to also write mod tools, editors, etc. too ?!

No, we don't. Game development often benefits from being data driven. Often this results in data being stored external configuration files. By keeping these files as text and sensibly naming the data within, you can give players the opportunity to mod your game at very little cost.


**5. Short games with great replayability can be as epic and grand as longer games.**

You don't have to make the next Skyrim to have an epic game. You can easily play a full game of FTL in a single sitting and yet it still feels like you've had an adventure. The variability due to the random nature each run means that I can have that same feeling of adventure each time I boot it up.

I've been using EADF for many years now. I love the hell out of it, it's very comfortable and fits my hand well, but every time I get a new game, or think about getting a new game, I'm hesitant to play it because I know I'll have to go through the tedious process of changing the keybindings to fit my scheme. 

I have some tips from my experience that might help drastically improve your user's experience with configuring your game.

1. Let your user actually configure the keybindings. There's a lot of games out there that have little to no configuration options for controls. I see it a lot in strategy games, like RUSE or Civ 5 (when the mouse is doing most of the work but advanced players use keyboard shortcuts), and occasionally in other genres as well. 

2. Make sure to include options to configure the mouse. Mice with more than two or three buttons are getting more popular nowadays, and you can bet if someone has a mouse with a bunch of buttons on it, they're going to want to use them.

3. Don't confirm rebinding, even when there's a conflict. Swap the bindings or, preferably, just unbind the conflicting control. It gets very tedious when you have to change 15 or 20 keybindings and you have to confirm every single one. If you're worried about users accidentally screwing up their keybindings, have a ""Reset to Default"" button. More than likely, they weren't intending to change anything, just looking to see which key does what. The few of us who actually go through this process will fix it if we screw it up, or go back to defaults and start again.

That's about it for now. If I can think of anything else, I'll be sure to add it. If anyone has anything to contribute, please do.

You can read the first post about [how to set your career goal at this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1giewv/breaking_into_game_design_part_1_find_your/).*

Although I do not review as many resumes now that I'm an indie developer working on [Enhanced Wars](http://www.enhancedwars.com) as I did when I was at BioWare San Francisco, I still review the odd resume here or there as a result of a Reddit or forum post. When I do, my top line feedback is almost always the same: ""You need to work on your portfolio website.""

At BioWare San Francisco, we had a strong affinity for interns and co-op students (who would work a full semester at the studio for credit). In a very real sense, we would not have launched Dragon Age Legends on time without the contributions from our co-op team members. As such, one of my favorite times of the year was when the fantastic university relations team at EA would deliver the resumes of potential interns they were bringing to campus for interviews.

It was not unusual for me to review 50 resumes in one marathon session to pick out the prospects that I thought would fit a need on my team. Whether I was reviewing a stack of resumes for intern candidates or a single resume from a recruiter for a full time position, my process was almost always the same. Open a resume and scan it for about a minute to look for highlights. Open the portfolio website link and spend a significant amount of time reviewing (if possible). If a portfolio was great, I would request a phone interview. On more than one occasion, I called someone instantly because the portfolio was so good I didn't want to waste any time lest the candidate be snatched up by another studio. Sometimes the candidate already had. A high quality portfolio was the single biggest factor in landing a phone interview.

**Tangible proof**

If your professional experience is minimal or non-existant, the challenge you face is that you have no credibility that you will be capable of fulfilling the job requirements. When I'm looking to fill a job, I don't care about your mission statement, your extra curricular activities or your summer job in a completely unrelated industry. I only care about proof of your design abilities.

It can be difficult to know what to put in a design portfolio, as there are no standards for what a good design document is or how a game economy should be laid out. The best possible thing to have in your portfolio is shipped games. With tools like Unity and Game Maker Studio and the ease of self publishing, it is my opinion that a prospective game designer should exit college with one game on the app store for each year in school. There is no stronger proof that you are a capable designer than being able to show that:

*You know how to finish a game and release it to the world
*You took the time to listen to your players, either through metrics, comments, reviews or other feedback
*You can tell a meaningful story about how you improved your game based on player feedback

Being able to tell me that story in the initial phone interview is an instant ticket to a full team interview.

Building a proper portfolio will take months, if not years. In college, I tried on multiple occasions to assemble a team to make a game. I got plenty of interest from programmers or artists who wished to talk about a game and collaborate, but when it came time to start working on the game they did not deliver. Unless you have a team you truly trust, my advice is to start out by making small but completed and polished games that you can build on your own. If you don't know how to code, it's time to learn!

**Feature portfolio material**

What you build for your portfolio is [highly dependent on your mountain](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1giewv/breaking_into_game_design_part_1_find_your/). No matter what type of design job you have, the tools exist to prove you are capable of doing high quality design work. If your mountain is to work on open world RPGs, then dive into the Dragon Age or Skyrim mod tools and make quests. If you want to work on multiplayer FPS, then dig into Unreal Engine 3 or Hammer and release levels to the world. If you want to work on a MOBA, then get cozy with the WarCraft III or Starcraft II editor and prototype a new MOBA style gameplay mode.

No matter what your mountain is, you cannot wait till you ""land that gig"" before you start learning how to design content. Only by proving you can finish content, release it to players, listen to their feedback and improve your content based on feedback will you be able to land that first professional gig. And if your goal is as targeted as working on a specific game or at a specific company, if they have publicly available tools you better invest time in mastering them.

**Other portfolio material**

A designer's job is much more dynamic than simply creating levels or quests. There are a number of other documents or types of content you can create and share as part of a portfolio. Here are some suggestions based off the varied types of work I do on [Enhanced Wars](http://www.enhancedwars.com) and other projects:

*Game Treatment* - no one is going to read a 75+ page game design document when evaluating you for a position. But they will scan a 5-7 page game treatment that outlines a game, its market and its core features at a high level.

*Feature Brief* - a detailed document that explains the full implementation of a single feature for a game, including UI wireframes and flow, goes a long way to impress. Design a new feature for an existing and well known game in the genre you wish to get hired in. Make sure that in the early part of the brief, you have a section explaining why this feature needs to be added to this game.

*Game balance evaluation* - much of a designer's job is tuning and balancing game variables. Pick a game and write a report evaluating balance of a particular system or economy. Take detailed notes on multiple play sessions, compile and summarize fan and review feedback and come up with a series of recommendations on how this system's balance can be improved.

*UI/UX redesign* - most of my work in mobile/tablet games involves designing or evaluating UI. Designing UI is a difficult task, especially if you've never done it before, but it is critical to a modern game's success. Pick a screen or flow from a popular game that you think is broken or unintuitive, and propose a detailed redesign.

*System balance spreadsheet* - most of my time as a designer is spent in spreadsheets or JSON files tweaking values. If you have followed the earlier advice and built some games, you will likely have a system values spreadsheet to share. Clean it up and add annotations so that another human can read it.

*Pen &amp; Paper prototype* - many games start as simple ideas prototyped on pen &amp; paper. Although you cannot easily share the results, you can share your process. Fully document with text and pictures the process of building a pen &amp; paper prototype complete with your final rule set. Explain the design problem you are trying to solve and show the steps you took to solve it, pointing out what does and does not work.

These are just a few examples based off my experience. If you've done your homework and spent time identifying job postings you would like to apply to, you may have other design deliverables you would want to build to prove one requirement or another.

**People are busy**

The hiring managers who will be evaluating your portfolio are likely to be some of the busiest people on the game team. They will not have a lot of time to review all the materials that you have spent months or years preparing. They will probably not install your game. They will probably not read your full document. They will probably not open your spreadsheet.

If you really want to shine, then for each piece in your portfolio you should create a 90 second or less video on youTube. In this video, show the piece of work, whether it is a level, design document or UI flow. Talk about the process of designing the work. What were your design goals? How did you achieve them? What feedback have you gotten from players or peers and how have you reacted to that feedback?

So, why go through all the effort to make materials that will likely only be glanced at?

1353375380.0,193,self.gamedev,13hfij,Why is there such hatred for production?,253,60,227,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/13hfij/why_is_there_such_hatred_for_production/,"[The Confab thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/13h1rr/the_2013_game_concept_confab_something_that/) specifically requested ""no /gamedev drama"" and I'm pretty sure this will qualify in their mind, so here comes a separate discussion.

I was excited to see the community get organized and make more games... and then I tripped over this line:
&gt; We don't need ""producers"" or ""product managers"" posting in here. You must bring a significant asset to the game concept; whether its fiction writing, art assets, code, source, or music.

Now, producer's my day job, so inherently, I feel a bit excluded.  There's more to it, though: the tone of the sentiment (and it's not the first time I've seen this tone applied to production) is what gets me: it's practically hostile to an entire industry discipline.  I'd like to get a discussion going and understand this viewpoint better.

So here's the things I notice in this comment:

* ""Producer"" has been given the finger-quote treatment, much like ""sandwich artist.""
* Production is excluded from the list of ""assets"" brought to the team.  It is, in effect, being considered worthless.
* For teams as small as three people, which collectively will have to cover the disciplines of game design, programming, art (2d and/or 3d), environment design, sound, and QA, *fiction writing* (a discipline whose value to any given project ranges from moderate to literally pointless) is an asset that gets you in the door, but production is emphatically **not**. (1)

As I said, I've seen this a *lot* in the indie community.  ""Producer"" gets spat out as a slur more than any other discipline I've seen.

I'll at least try to take my best stab at why this happens:

* First, very few starting people may understand what production *is* or what producers *do*.  I certainly know a handful of professionals that consider the producer ""the annoying person who keeps asking me to do things.""
* It follows, then, that a notable number of people in indie development have taken the mantle of ""producer"" under the guise of ""person in charge,"" i.e. ""guy who gets to tell everyone what to do.""  (I'm usually ""guy ultimately responsible for everything,"" but again, the difference between that and ""guy in charge"" isn't obvious to everyone.)
* On the indie side, the people most likely to make this poor equivalence are the people who want to make games but lack talent in other disciplines.  (To be completely honest, this happens on the pro side more than I care to admit!)
* So, you end up with indie ""producers"" (there go the finger quotes) who hand out a lot of orders, don't do a lot of actual production, and generally come off more like the grossly out-of-touch executive... which, admittedly, has no place on a three-man team.

So, question time:

* What value do you place on production relative to other disciplines?
* If you value production very little, why is that?
* Along the same lines, what's the largest project you've worked on that didn't manage the production in some way?
* Do you consider production problematic, or just ""producers""?

(1) Fiction writers: I consider your work dearly important to games for which it is a focus.  Many games, especially small games, don't require a fiction writer.  I personally hold that most games involving more than one person can benefit from at least some good production.  It is this contrast of necessity that surprises me; I'm not trying to slag on your discipline.

**EDIT**: Wow, a great discussion!  It looks like the TL;DR is ""people's experience with production has been largely negative, through any combination of incompetence, bureaucracy, and other factors commonly attributed to poor management.""  This perception is significantly affected by (1) professional use of production as a way to promote people; (2) ""producer"" serving as a indie-level dumping-ground title used by ""idea guy who wants to lead project""; (3) producers treating the role as ""person in charge"" rather than ""responsible facilitator and enabler.""

Believe it or not, this provides really good insight into some professional feedback I've received (including a level designer who told me ""you're one of two competent producers I've ever met."")  I may look into this further, and figure out if we're largely screwing up production as an industry...",,False,,t5_2qi0a,1353433731.0,,,True,t3_13hfij,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/13hfij/why_is_there_such_hatred_for_production/,

Right, let me just hit this up for you. If you're suffering from depression and/or burnout: You are not alone, and it is not a 'burden' or a 'call for attention' when you need to talk about it.

This is a hobby/activity/industry where this shit happens. I've worked on Arnthak for over three years now - it's had its highs, and it's had a tremendous amount of lows. Just about everyone else I've ever talked to experiences these moments. This happens.

What's not good, is if there are more lows than highs, or if you find yourself staying in the hole.

We care about you. Here's some things that have helped me in the past, maybe they can help you as well:

* Talking to other devs - build contacts, others who know where you're at.
* Playing games from other devs - sometimes you want to stay in the gamedev zone... just... not with *your* game.
* Playing other games - it can become a habit to stop playing anything else, but this can be a trap! Go out and play some Dwarf Fortress or something
* Get outside - go for walks, get some exercise (I just bought a kite, it's fucking amazing)
* Talk to friends, family - it sometimes feels like you're just burdening others - don't let a divide open up.
* Show us your stuff - feedback is great, and sometimes the boost from it can smooth out the bad times.

Above all: If things are becoming a pattern, or spiraling out of control - get help. There's no shame in just having a chat with a professional. Do not try to 'just tough it out', you don't have to be alone.

Also, the graphic doesn't show the *popularity* of each resolution, so keep in mind that any particular resolution - especially the really strange ones like 640x240 - may be rare in practice.  (But it's probably a good idea to make sure your UI would work gracefully with those resolutions, anyway.)

A list of iOS devices can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iOS_devices).  Since the Wikipedia article on Android is not comprehensive (it does not show all 1300+ Android devices, and some table entries do not include a screen resolution), you should probably not rely on my graphic being comprehensive, either.

I graduated from the University of Dubuque, Iowa with a degree in Computer Graphics and Interactive Media in 2010 and I have been making games ever since. I currently live in Victoria, Kansas with my wife and our dog, [Peanut](http://tylerowen.info/storage/lacunapassage/peanut.jpg).

I worked on a couple educational gaming projects for Best Buy's Geek Squad Summer Academy in [2011](http://youtu.be/AXXHLN6vSNg) and [2012](http://youtu.be/XJooK8Itd38). During that time I also created a few games in my spare time, including [Iceberg Frenzy for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iceberg-frenzy/id492297617?mt=8) and [Protobotic on Newgrounds](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/604776). I became really comfortable with Unity after working on the Best Buy GSSA titles so I abandoned mobile and web games to work on something bigger in Unity.

The idea for Lacuna Passage came about after the successful landing of the Curiosity rover on Mars. I have always been a big fan of space exploration so I kept wondering what it would be like for the first human explorers on Mars. What might they find? What kinds of challenges would they face? I read a lot of books on the subject and ultimately decided that it would make a great video game. I have spent the last year researching, planning, and prototyping Lacuna Passage with a small team of volunteers and collaborators. All of this has led to a [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tylerowen/lacuna-passage) to raise funding to finish the game. We only have 9 days left, but things are looking good.

During early development I began experimenting with different resources that might help me create the terrain of Mars more accurately and eventually I came up with a process to utilize actual Mars satellite data from the [HiRISE mapping project](http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/). You can read about how it is done in our devlog ([Part 1](http://randomseedgames.com/blog/2013/2/1/lacuna-passage-devlog-1-building-mars) and [Part 2](http://randomseedgames.com/blog/2013/2/6/lacuna-passage-devlog-2-building-mars-part-2)).

Throughout development I have found the Unity Asset Store to be immensely helpful in allowing me to quickly prototype different ideas using powerful plugins which I have adapted over time to form the foundation of Lacuna Passage. I wrote [another devlog post](http://randomseedgames.com/blog/2013/4/18/devlog-9-the-power-of-unity-plugins) about all the different plugins that we have utilized.

I have been very active here on Reddit about the game, posting in Screenshot Saturdays and sharing relevant devlogs which has led to lots of great press. Since we first starting talking about Lacuna Passage the game has been featured on [Mashable](http://mashable.com/2013/03/12/explore-martian-terrain-in-indie-game/), [Discovery News](http://news.discovery.com/space/video-game-uses-real-martian-landscape.htm), [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/an-indie-mars-based-survival-game-inspired-by-pokemo-643977567), [Rock Paper Shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/05/14/mars-topography-photography-lacuna-passage/), and many more sites.

Greenlight is a bit opaque, and I think if a few people share their experiences, others will be able to learn and tailor their campaigns better. 

So here's a breakdown of the campaign with some notes along the way:

[Five hours in](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=92&amp;mode=view)

The Greenlight went up. Lots of twitter attention and retweets. Posted on the (800 person) facebook page

[Eight hours in](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=93&amp;mode=view)

Around this mark we started to get some coverage. RPS covered the trailer and also linked to a ""lets play"" that I had ""liked"" on my Youtube account. Eurogamer and VG24/7 did small articles with video embeds.

[Twenty Four hours in](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=94&amp;mode=view)

Around this mark the (~8000)Kickstarter backers were notified in a big update.

We got coverage from Beefjack who I offered some comments to, to add value to their piece.

[Thirty hours in](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=95&amp;mode=view)

The (~500) Indiegogo backers got an update as did the (~2000) subscribed to our newsletter.

[Fourty eight hours in](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=96&amp;mode=view)

[Fifty six hours in](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=99&amp;mode=view)

With the campaign going well I updated my Kickstarter backers on the progress of the campaign. By posting the full stats and a bit of commentary it provided enough news to be picked up by a few outlets, such as vg24/7.

[102 hours in](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=101&amp;mode=view)

At this point the campaign really started to flag. Pretty much all the coverage was now stale and most of the votes came from regular Greenlight users.

[104 hours in](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=102&amp;mode=view)

With some extra tweeting, a bit of Facebook spam and rabble rousing on the forums, the graph started to edge up again. Pretty critical to do as much as you can at this point to maintain interest.

[Seven days in](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=109&amp;mode=view)

We languished at 98-99% for almost a day.

[Right now](http://forum.maiagame.com/download/file.php?id=110&amp;mode=view) 

We finally made it into the top 100 games on the service!


**A few notes/observations/opinions:**

**When to Greenlight:**

If you are crowd funding, create ""concept"" Greenlight rather than a full one during your campaign. Firstly, a Greenlight campaign will dilute your marketing, use up precious time and be a distraction. Secondly, if are a small developer, you risk the Greenlight falling flat (spreading your votes out too thin over time) and not getting Valves attention.

Secondly, Steam has limited ""bandwidth"" to decide on games, so a Greenlight during your crowdfunding for a game months away is taking attention away from people who might be desperate to release right now. 


**Genre selection:**

One other thing to note is what genre you place your game in. Amoung my selections I had ""casual"", which seemed to cause a mild backlash. Removing that selection decreased the number of negative votes somewhat. 


**Coverage:**

News sites are unlikely to cover your game if you send out releases for a Greenlight. Most have a no crowdfunding/Greenlight policy unless you are very famous. For the Greenlight campaign I only sent one email to the press. I regret not sending time before hand making more of a story to give the press an angle and make it more worthy of coverage.

If you want sites to feature you: 

* Pick a slow news day, preferably just after lunch on a Tuesday.
* Ensure you have a press page on your site with NEW screenshots up.
* Video content is easy to post and speaks for itself so sites are more likely to write an article around it. Make sure it's new footage!
* Stagger your release, so your page and video have lots of comments and you have fixed all the mistakes before the press show up.
* Like any marketing drive, try to build up press awareness a few weeks before launching, so the game is fresh in people's minds. (we had RPS and PCGamer coverage a week before that really helped us)
* Do something else newsworthy, or offer interviews to give them some decent content.

**Don't spam:**

As with crowdfunding, people tire quickly so avoid spamming your channels. Try and make every post newsworthy and encourage participation. I gave a sporadic running commentary of our stats to keep people engaged, without irritating them with noise.

**Extract value:**

Link people to your mailing list and encourage them to favourite your page, so you will be able to contact them easily in the future.

**Cross promote:**

The indie games scene is not a zero sum game. This means that you are not in competition with other games for the attention of your potential customers. Team up and promote your project with other developers, don't try to exist in a vacuum, you won't get very far. Lot's of our votes came from the communities of other games!

I'll add to this as I dig out more notes from the last week!

Anyone else has stats/opinions they'd like to share? :)

---

It’s been nearly 6 months since I went full-time indie, and it’s been a lot of work (and fun!) so far. Dropping my only source of income in order to develop games for a living sounds pretty reckless, but there was really no better time for me to try and make the transition. With only $500 to my name, and already a few months into the year, I set myself a goal to make a minimum wage of $18,200 online by the end of 2012. Today, I have met that goal. And it’s only September.

After announcing this achievement on my Twitter and Facebook I received several messages asking if I had any tips for aspiring developers. It’s probably not all that common to find success while starting off as a full-time indie, so I’d like to share my thoughts on the process of achieving this milestone. As always, this will just be my opinion on what worked for me – there will always be other ways to achieve the same result.

How To Prepare

Before you make the transition to full-time indie you need to be thoroughly prepared for what lays ahead. Make sure you ask yourself these questions:

    - What do I hope to achieve by going indie?
    - When is the best time to make the transition?
    - How risky is it?
    - What is my fall back plan?
    - Do I have a skill set that can be monetized?

Your answers to these are very important.

If you go full-time indie, you are no longer just making games for fun…you are making them for a living. This is a crucial mindset to get into. When your next meal or bill is due, it doesn’t matter if you’re having fun making games or not – you still have to get the job done. The excellent documentary Indie Game: The Movie really highlights just how stressful indie game development can be when money is thrown into the equation.

Unless you’re already set for life, your goal as a full-time indie will ultimately be to make money. Of course you want to make incredible games along the way, but money is what enables you to keep making them. Otherwise, it’s back to the office!

I recently watched a presentation by David Edery (Triple Town, Realm of the Mad God) where he refers to indies often striving to be “the good guy developer”. That’s all well and fine, but remember that in the end you can not give away your work for free, as much as you might want to. Design everything you do to result in a payoff of some kind. For example, while I very much enjoy writing posts like this, my blog is a primarily promotional tool. I simply couldn’t afford to spend the time writing this post if it didn’t help to promote my book or improve my platform.

The point is, you need to prepare yourself to be money-orientated once you go full-time indie. It’s no longer just fun and games (pun totally intended!)

Most importantly, you absolutely need a fall back plan. It’s a distinct possibility that you may not succeed, for a range of reasons. Be sure to separate your savings into two categories: money that can be invested in your effort, and money that you can fall back on if it doesn’t work out. If you have a family to support this becomes even more critical. Optimally, you want to be prepared to survive at least a year without a steady income. Hopefully it won’t take that long for you to start making money as an indie, but you need that safeguard in place.

How To Succeed

Some people think I’ve just been lucky, but making $18,200 online in 6 months requires time and effort, not luck. These two factors are really the key elements behind any success.

As I’ve discussed previously, to succeed as an indie developer you need to be dedicated and focused, and make the best possibly use of your time. You may still end up working 8 hour days, and it may still be a grind. No matter how much you enjoy game development it may become just as tedious as a day job. This is something you’ll have to work through.

Of course, it takes more than hard work and dedication to succeed.

Try identifying fields that are relevant to your work where you may not necessarily be experienced. I study a lot of different fields online to round out my skill set, and I constantly experiment with new services and concepts. This helps me be more self-sufficient and prepares me for a lot of situations. For example, when I have to eventually market my book I will already have a wealth of information and experience to back me up…all of it self-taught. It’s better to have this type of knowledge at your disposal before you need it, so study up!

I’d also recommend making new contacts at every chance – interact with everyone you can. Not only does this generate new possibilities for you, but it helps to establish your platform. If I hadn’t spent over a year building my platform and interacting with my fellow developers there’s no way I would have received $1000 in pre-order book sales at this point. Sure, it’s time consuming posting on forums and social media, but it is useful. Not to mention you’ll get to meet a bunch of great people in the process. To think one email sent to a single developer has led me to talks with internet giant AOL is incredible.

Finally, diversify! I discovered how important it is to diversify when Google banned me from AdSense but it was only in the following months that I realized how difficult it can be to do so. When you find one source of income that really pays off, it’s difficult to justify neglecting it in favor of creating another income stream. But at the end of the day, an online income is a volatile one and you need to be prepared for the worst. This is another reason to improve your general skill set…the more you know the more you can do.

Overall, I still don’t feel like I’ve achieved anything too special in the past 6 months. I’ve made some money with some games, but I still think anyone could do what I did. It’s part of the appeal of my book. Other developers can take what I’ve learned and replicate my success.

That said, I feel very fortunate to be in this position where I can currently maintain a decent living online. I’ll try to keep improving it over the coming years, and I plan to keep on sharing my experiences here on my blog. As always, thanks for reading, and I hope this post has been useful to you!

The past 4 years I've been producing my very own experimental music. Within every piece of my music there is part of my emotion inside of it. It’s created from anger, sadness, frustration and even happiness. I've been told it’s similar to Deus Ex and Half Life (the music of the games).


Within the time of music making I've came to realize that I don’t want to perform my work in front of a crowd. Yet I want to establish my emotional pieces within something much more than just a music site. As a child growing up I always enjoyed raw emotion from games. Surely playing a game with an amazing story or environment also needs that musical connection. Something that brings forth the emotion of the player… Anyways I’ll stop rambling about myself and let you just listen in on some of my pieces of work.

My job is not IT related at all. I decided to jump into iOS programming. I love games, so making a game felt a natural choice. After reading up on some sites I decided to clone a pong game.
It has single player mode vs Ai and two player mode on same device. It has music and sound effects! Hardest part by far was complicated collision logic using vectors and heavy nested if statements. For example if you hit the ball with top part of the paddle, it will go up, if you hit it with center it will go to center and if you hit with the lower part it will go down, regardless of angle it came with. That adds complexity and nice feeling of control. It also uses small particle effect when the ball collides with paddle for eye candy. The game was written in cocos2d 1.0

Here is the video of it, check it out:

Looking into other people first game it doesn't seem that bad! It already makes me feel great that I accomplished a little milestone in becoming a programmer. I submitted it to appstore, of course it will be free, if they let it in.
Please let me know what you think!

Oh by the way, my inspiration was Whitaker Trebella @wtrebella - the creator of Polymer and Luca Redwood - the creator of 10000000 - if you have iPhone you should definately check out his game.

Edit: Thank you all for your insightful comments, and the mighty reddit has spoken.  The general theme I am seeing is that people want options, and have privacy concerns with Facebook.   There was a suggestion that we follow stack exchange's model, and we enable you to choose what fits you best : OpenId, Google, Facebook, Yahoo, or any other OpenId provider.  Of course, we are still open for further suggestions.  Thanks again.

Judging by the amount of submissions we remove on a daily basis, we felt it was necessary to put together something that would help our members better decide whether or not to post their content in /r/gamedev.

As moderators, our main concern is to keep things on topic -- for instance, we're a community about game development, but not about games in general or development in general. We also value meaningful discussion and mutual feedback as opposed to one-way promotion. This FAQ seeks to clarify our policies in that regard.

If you are not sure whether or not to post in /r/gamedev, or this FAQ does not answer your question, please do not hesitate to message the moderators or drop by the IRC channel (see sidebar), we'll be more than happy to help.

**Q: I'm XX years old and I want to become a game developer. Where should I start? What language should I learn? What college should I go to? What country should I move to? Do I need X degree or qualification?**

**A:** These questions are extremely common, and usually create never-ending debates. Typically, we will remove such posts because they are too vague and do not lead to meaningful discussions. Please make sure to read the sidebar, which contains many resources on getting started.

Additionally, there's an excellent subreddit specifically for people looking to get started at /r/learnprogramming.

For career advice, make sure to check out /r/cscareerquestions.

---

**Q: I have a technical question I would like to ask game developers. Can I post in /r/gamedev?**

**A:** Beginner questions are not entirely forbidden at /r/gamedev, however if you do decide to ask one, we ask that you please refrain from being vague. If it's a technical question, identify the specific problem you're facing. [Make sure to ""ask the duck your question"" first](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/rubber-duck-problem-solving.html).

If you need advice on choosing a language, a file format, a library, etc., do tell us which ones you're currently using, why they don't fit the bill, what you're trying to achieve, and how you've gone about trying to solve the problem so far.

Before you post, please also make sure that your question is directly related to game development. Many libraries have their own forum, mailing list or IRC channel. If your question is about a general programming or math issue, consider posting to /r/learnprogramming or [Stack Exchange](http://www.stackexchange.com/).

**Q: I am a developer and I am working on/just finished a project. Can I post about it in /r/gamedev?**

**A:** /r/gamedev is for topics that are of interest to game developers as opposed to end-users. If you want to promote your project to potential players or testers, please post in an appropriate gamer-oriented subreddit, such as /r/indiegaming.

Having said that, note that /r/gamedev has special weekly threads to share and promote projects:

* Feedback Friday is a thread where you can post playable versions of your projects and give and receive feedback from fellow developers.

* Screenshot Saturday is a weekly opportunity to share info, videos and screenshots of your work in progress.

You are highly encouraged to participate in these threads and share feedback with your peers.

/r/gamedev does welcome technical discussions and post-mortems. If you do decide to introduce your game here, the content should be different from the kind of promotion you would do in a gamer-oriented forum. Some examples of what you can do:

* Make sure to introduce yourself briefly

* Mention past projects you've worked on, if any.

* Explain what your game is, how the idea came about.

* Tell us about the languages, engines, resources you used.

* Tell us about the development process and the challenges you faced.

* Tell us how you plan on marketing your game.

* If your post is about a finished project, talk to us about your experience with the release, sales, reception, etc.

* Be sure to link us to screenshots, videos and reviews, if applicable.

Remember that Reddit has a self-serve advertising system. If you want to advertise something, an ad campaign targeting your end-users probably makes more sense than posting in /r/gamedev.

---

**Q: I am a developer/artist/writer/sound technician/designer and I am looking for a job/team/collaboration opportunity. Can I post in /r/gamedev?**

**A:** No. To browse job opportunities or submit your resume/portfolio, please visit /r/gamedevclassifieds.

There is also a specialty subreddit intended for forming game development teams at /r/INAT.

---

**Q: I just wrote a blog post about my current project. Can I post the link in /r/gamedev?**

**A:** There is a subreddit specifically for posting development blog articles over at /r/devblogs. Also, for updates about work in progress, we have Screenshot Saturday, which encourages mutual feedback.

Proper tech writeups and post mortems are however more than welcome. As a general rule, ""Just added goblins to my game"" can go into /r/devblogs, but ""A comprehensive analysis of the sales figures for my iOS game"" and ""Hacking weapon view models into the depth buffer"" are okay.

If possible, introduce your article and stick around to answer questions.

---

**Q: We just started a funding campaign for our game on Kickstarter/IndieGogo/etc. Can we post the link to /r/gamedev?**

**A:** To post a kickstarter (or similar), you must be a member of the project and you must make yourself available to answer technical questions. The discussion should have a game development focus and not be simply about advertising your game to potential players.

Note that these types of threads have not fared very well on /r/gamedev in the past. If your project is not directly relevant to game development, consider advertising your project in an end-user oriented subreddit.

---

**Q: I work for a company that sells Unity plugins/3D modeling software/mobile platform licenses/books, etc. Can I tell /r/gamedev about our awesome new product?**

**A:** It's important that if you do promote your products on /r/gamedev, you create a meaningful discussion with game developers.

Post in Feedback Friday if possible, making sure that you give developers opportunities to try the product(s) for free (for instance, by giving out a limited number of licenses for free if you have no free trial option), hear out developers' feedback, and answer questions to the best of your ability.

Again, Reddit has an ad program, and promotional posts tend to get downvoted, so if promoting a product to /r/gamedev's 40,000+ subscribers is important to you, consider using Reddit's self-serve advertising system.

---

**TL;DR This subreddit is about game development, not games in general. Post things that are relevant to the interests of game developers, otherwise, find an appropriate gamer-oriented subreddit. Make posts that are informative and generate meaningful discussions, and ask good questions. Self-promotion is encouraged in our weekly ""show-and-tell"" threads, but rarely tolerated otherwise.**",,False,,t5_2qi0a,False,,,True,t3_152gxs,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/152gxs/the_great_rgamedev_posting_guidelines/,moderator

In this multi-part tutorial series, I create a simple physics based Pong clone using PSM.  It covers using the GameEngine2D and Physics2D libraries, and contains basic implementations of everything you need to make a more complex game ( sprites, physics, UI, sound effects&amp;music, scene changing, scoreboards, etc ).  It is split across 5 parts, each starting with the complete code, then a line by line explanation.  It ends with a summary that contains all of the code on a single page, as well as a project you can download, including all assets.

* [Part One](http://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2012/09/07/A-complete-PlayStation-Vita-game-from-scratch-Part-One.aspx) -- Main, title screen and graphic resources

It is by no means perfect, there are still some tweaks to be done.  The AI is purposefully stupid ( the first version was unbeatable... oops ), the collisions need some refinement etc... but I didn't want to muddy up the code with such details, it is already long enough for a simple pong clone.  Regardless, it should serve as a useful starting point if you want to work with PlayStation Mobile.  There are currently no documents, examples or tutorials that cover using all the different libraries together.

1352676548.0,180,self.gamedev,1316sc,"A Technical Analysis of the ""Super Mario RPG"" Game System",218,38,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1316sc/a_technical_analysis_of_the_super_mario_rpg_game/,"**Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars** was a game released by Square in 1996. The RPG system itself is fairly simplistic: it lacks any kind of ""skills"" such as Climb, Barter or Swim. Instead it focuses entirely upon combat for it's system resorting to dexterity games for the player to resolve any miscellaneous tests.

The data I used to analyze the system is, admittedly, a rather small sample size spanning the first seven (7) levels of the game. This covers a total of 18 enemy creatures five (5) of which I (subjectively) considered to be a boss or mini boss. A boss or mini boss was determined by the overall magnitude of the battle, and was usually distinct by their being dialog with the enemy before/during/after combat. The main player character, Mario, was also analyzed and used to compare to the enemies and bosses.

[Figure 1 - The Data](http://i.imgur.com/QEITg.png)

Boss monsters are highlighted in yellow.

**RPG SYSTEM BASICS**

The main system has four main character components:

* **Attack**
* **Defense**
* **Magic Attack**
* **Magic Defense**

Additionally, there are **Hit Points** which determine your characters overall life, and **Flower Points** which are essentially the same as the more commonly known Mana Points (or MP) which determines how many spells you can cast. Flower Points are increased by finding ""Flower Tabs"" throughout the game and *do not* increase through the normal leveling system; so they were left out of this analysis.

**EXPERIENCE POINTS**

As your character defeats monsters and challenges, he is rewarded with **Experience Points** which can allow Mario to attain a new **Level** once a certain amount has been reached.

[Figure 2 - Experience Points Needed vs Experience Points Given](http://i.imgur.com/w16FG.png)

As you can see in Figure 2 the amount of XP needed to attain a new level stair steps up while the overall payout from defeating monsters stays essentially the same. As expected Boss monsters give slightly more XP then normal enemies. Ideally, the amount of XP given would remain completely flat, as any rise would offset the stair step requirement of the level ladder.

**COMBAT - ATTACK**

A character's ""Attack Power"" is the amount of damage dealt to an enemy. Part of the damage is nullified each attack by an enemies ""Defense Power"", with the remainder reducing the enemies Hit Points.

&gt; For example, an Attack Power of 10 would deal 10 damage except if the enemy had 3 Defense in which case only 7 damage would get through.

There is a timing mechanism in the game in which if the player presses the controller button at a specific time during the attack they can increase the amount of damage dealt somewhere between 1.5-1.7x the normal rate. This amount is only a guess on my part as I don't have the exact numbers to pin a figure down.

[Figure 3 - Player Attack vs Enemy Attack](http://i.imgur.com/OLnOJ.png)

One of the hallmarks of many Japanese RPGs is the fact that the players deal much more damage then the enemies do; but in return the enemies have orders of magnitude higher Hit Points. Figure 3 compares the amount of damage a player can deal vs what the enemies and bosses can deal. Even the bosses are no match for what Mario can deliver!

You'll notice in Figure 3, as in the other examples a certain trend: The characters' stats climb linearly while the enemies tend to favor a more ""wave"" pattern. The Bosses stats tend to bloom upwards more in a stair step or bull curve fashion.

[Figure 4 - Player Magic Attack vs Enemy Magic Attack](http://i.imgur.com/PvtQv.png)

Looking at the Magical Attack abilities we once again see that the players tend to have the upper hand. Interestingly the Boss enemies did reign supreme for a short while. However this can be partially explained by the fact that the first spike is right about the time a second friendly character, Mallow, is introduced. Mario and Mallow are tasked with defeating a single enemy who is understandably more difficult then it's preprocessors.

**COMBAT - DEFENSE**

[Figure 5 - Player Defense vs Enemy Defense](http://i.imgur.com/AygMG.png)

Defense is the amount of damage that gets absorbed *before* it reduces the Hit Points of the receiving party. It's essentially ""armor"". In figure 5 we can see the players are no match even compared to the normal-leveled enemies. The enemies, especially the bosses, are designed to take a beating. It should be noted, however, that monsters do come in different strengths with some holding a lot of armor while others even less then the players themselves.

[Figure 6 - Player Magic Defense vs Enemy Magic Defense](http://i.imgur.com/cdwld.png)

Figure 6 tells a slightly different tail in which the competing parties are fairly even until after mid game when both Monsters and Bosses take the lead. This can be partially explained by the fact that in the opening of the game very little magic is used and so a defense for it is not required.

**HIT POINTS**

[Figure 7 - Player Hit Points vs Enemy Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/E9yhw.png)

This is where we see the trademark of Japanese-based RPGs. While the Player's hit points are about the same as the Monster's hit points; it's the Bosses that tend to have exponentially more HP. In Figure 7 you can see that while the player only has about 50 HP, the boss he faces has 500!

It should be noted that the saving grace to this runaway train is that right about the same time the Boss HP exploded was the same time a secondary character, Mallow, was introduced making the fight two-against-one. Also, note from Figure 3 &amp; 4 that the characters can deal more damage to an enemy then they receive. 

**ATTACK VS DEFENSE**

So far I've been comparing Apples to Apples. However, how do the dynamics work when a player character deals damage to an enemy? How much Defense is there in respect to the Attack power of the Player?

[Figure 8 - Player Attack vs Monster Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/u3rF8.png)

Figure 8 describes a rather beautiful relationship between the amount of damage dealt vs the amount that can be absorbed. We see that the blue line (Player Attack) never dips below the red line (Monster Defense), lest the player would deal no damage!

As mentioned earlier the monster's stats tend to follow a wave pattern while the player characters favor a linear progression.

[Figure 9 - Player Attack vs Boss Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/FhG8p.png)

Looking at how a player's attack rating stands against a Boss defense is once again dwarfed by the sheer scale of the Boss's Hit Point value.

**DEFENSE VS ATTACK**

[Figure 10 - Monster Attack vs Player Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/AOFEQ.png)

Turning the tables we can look at how well a player character can take damage dealt by a monster. We see similar results as in Figure 8 where the blue line never dips below the red; which would cause the monster to deal no damage to the player!

[Figure 11 - Boss Attack vs Player Defense &amp; Hit Points](http://i.imgur.com/BrmBk.png)

The results are a little more erratic when it comes to Bosses. It would seem, in fact, that a boss has all of it's damage nullified by the players armor between points 5 &amp; 6. This however is a bit misleading as the graph rendering software used in this analysis dipped the line lower then it should be in an attempt to ""smooth"" the lines. It is a close call though. Figure 1 will show that there is only a single point difference in favor of the Boss. A weak Boss if you ask me!

Please note that the results for magic attacks vs magic defenses (the player giving the attack) are, for all intents and purposes, the same as Figures 8-11. You can see the graphs [here](http://i.imgur.com/VJJuY.png) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/ggQo5.png).

**ATTACK VS MAGIC ATTACK**

[Figure 12 - Enemy Attack vs Enemy Magic Attack](http://i.imgur.com/OgAp6.png)

Looking at the progression of the game, it would make sense that normal attacks would be replaced with more powerful and verbose magic attacks. However, conventional wisdom would be wrong according to Figure 12. We see, instead, a dip in magic attacks by normal enemies. The sudden rise in use of magic attacks by bosses can not be taken without also noticing the rise in normal attacks as well.

It would seem, instead, that all the attacks are progressively getting stronger.

**DEFENSE VS MAGIC DEFENSE**

[Figure 13 - Enemy Defense vs Enemy Magic Defense](http://i.imgur.com/Pw5zN.png)

Counter to Figure 12, we see that as the game progresses (and the player characters gain more and more spells) an interest in Magic Defenses begins to blossom. For regular monsters, near the end of my analysis, there is a steep rise in magic defenses just as normal defenses take a dip. Bosses are more well-rounded and choose to increase both sets of defense.

**COINS REWARDED**

[Figure 14 - Coins Rewarded](http://i.imgur.com/eySSv.png)

Shifting gears a bit, we can compare the number of coins offered as a reward for defeating an enemy. Nothing too surprising here: Bosses offer a larger reward then normal Monsters. Curiously, the payout for defeating a regular Monster barely rises until the end (which can be attributed to one particularly difficult monster--""Pandorite"").

**OVERALL STRENGTH OF PLAYERS AND MONSTERS**

[Figure 15 - Player P/T Sum vs Enemy P/T Sum](http://i.imgur.com/qjuZx.png)

When we add up the total value for both forms of Attack and both forms of Defense (or as I like to call them ""Power"" and ""Toughness"") and purposefully exclude Hit Points, we can compare players, monsters and bosses in an ""arms race"" of sorts. The overall combat effectiveness tends to favor the players, though the bosses make their signature spike to the top for a bit.

[Figure 16 - Total Enemies Strength (Hit Points Omitted)](http://i.imgur.com/sii9h.png)

Figure 16 compares all of the enemies (monsters and bosses combined) in a measurement of who has more points allocated to the Attack and Defense slots. Croco, Mack, Pandorite and Belome (the right-most bar) are the clear heavyweights.

[Figure 17 - Total Enemies Strength](http://i.imgur.com/GIGo8.png)

Lastly, I added the Hit Points back into the match to see who among the enemies is the one with the most points *total*. The Bosses are the clear winners. Curiously Pandorite (the second from the right) stands amongst the giants which are exclusively all Bosses.

I had a poll a few days ago wondering if anyone is interested in a pixelart course and the response was astounding! 

This course is meant for absolute beginners who want to do their own game graphics but do not know where to start. Even if you plan on hiring out your art, having knowledge in pixeling will let you judge your product with new eyes. 

For this course if you have any questions or want to post your work comment in the thread below or PM me on this profile. Any other community members who are wanting to help please say so and I will put your name up here. **Judges to look out for** brevr, tylo.

Now to get right into the lesson. Some things that you will need for this course are:

* Photo editing program

* Mouse or pen tablet (NO TRACKPAD)

* Patience, Pixel art is a time consuming process


For programs to use, there are almost an infinite amount you can use. Personally, I use Photoshop. Other popular programs are:
 
* Graphics Gale (Free)

* Grafx2 (Free)

* GIMP (Free last I checked)

* MS paint


A lot of these programs are pretty similar, with exception for Grafx2 which is already set up for pixel art. For the other programs, the first thing you want to do is set up your brushes. The brush set you are looking for in Photoshop, GG, and Gimp is the square brush set. Check online for your specific program on how to get to these brushes. Once you do locate them find the size one or 1px brush. This will be your main brush for just about anything in Pixel art. Familiarize yourself with the other options, tools and setting of your program before continuing to the next step. You should look for an eye dropper tool, a select tool, a free select tool (lasso), +800% zoom, and a colour selection tool that has either hexidecimal support of RGB/HSL sliders, We'll get into what those mean later. To my knowledge all the programs above have all of these except MS paint and hexidecimal numbering. **Please don't PM me with questions about these programs I have only ever used them lightly. Check online for help or post in the thread below**

This tutorial is aimed right to people making games, and by the end of this course you all will have a game mock up completed. You can see some examples [here.](http://www.pixeljoint.com/pixels/new_icons.asp?search=mock+up&amp;dimo=%3E%3D&amp;dim=10&amp;colorso=%3E%3D&amp;colors=2&amp;tran=&amp;anim=&amp;iso=&amp;av=&amp;owner=0&amp;d=&amp;dosearch=1&amp;ob=search&amp;action=search) Today, we are going to start with the UI or user interface for those who don't know what that meant. UI's are incredibly subjective and everyone likes them different, so I am not going to tell you how it is supposed to look. You can decide between a spread out UI, with bits and pieces of info scattered around the screen, or a enclosed UI with all the information you need in one specific area. For simplicities sake we are going to go with the enclosed UI. I came up with a quick [example](http://i.imgur.com/VxW6N.png) of the template that we will be using in this lesson. All I did here was mark out what size I wanted the UI to be, as well as everything inside it. 

Now for actual Pixeling! We are going to start with the weapon icon for a space shooter example. Now, those who are going to criticize my examples please don't because they are simply used to accentuate **one** concept at a time. I know colours will be off as well as saturation, just, don't act like a douche. With that out of the way, lets get started. The first thing you want to do whenever you start to pixel a piece is to get a basic framework done. You want to [define the proportions](http://i.imgur.com/XgrVl.png) of what you want to make. This is a simple outline for a space ship to go with the space shooter theme. We are going to go with a laser rifle or something like that for our weapon icon. This icon will just be a detailed image of what the weapon shoots out in-game. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/1CZlU.png) is the basic outline, and take note they are all the same, but again this is just a basic idea of what you will do. I suggest that you do this as well until you grasp all the concepts of the course. 

Quickly before we move on, this [fantastic](http://goto.glocalnet.net/richard_fhager/db16_v1_analyze.png) palette created by Dawnbringer at Pixeljoint.com

Once you complete your outline, you will want to start colouring it in. I decided to go with some [blues](http://i.imgur.com/pcPQa.png) for my example. We are going to start with a base blue, or whatever colour you decide to use, and fill the entire outline with it. We then use a very deep, royal blue for the interior lining. This is something that *some* pixel artist use to stylize their pieces, I like it and it gives some good definition and detail without being too difficult. To do the interior lining, you just take the royal blue and make a ring inside the outline, leaving one pixel space between the two the whole time. Once that is done, we have to decide on where the light source is. For this simple example lets say that the laser is brighter on the edges than in the middle. Also, lets say that the tail end of it will be brighter than the front. With this in mind we take a lighter blue than our base and block in highlights where we want the laser to be brighter. We take an even lighter colour now for the brightest points. We fill in the light blue areas partially with this new colour, using more of it where it is lightest. Once that is done, congrats! you made your first piece of pixel art. You now can just copy/paste it to the other lasers like [this](http://i.imgur.com/4xSRO.png) or change them up, like I did for the middle shot of that example. Now as pointed out by duerthur, never pillow shade! Pillow shading is when you put the highlight of an object right in the centre or near centre, then you shade in concentric circles around it. This looks terrible! It looks unrealistic, and with very few exceptions this would never be the proper way to shade something in.

For those of you who thought, ""okay cool, but it doesn't look that great...."" Here is your time to improve your piece. We are going to work on two things here, stylized colouring and dithering. These are pretty much the same thing in this [example](http://i.imgur.com/3tdKZ.png) and pretty much all pieces. You can see that instead of using a gradient, pixel artists use dithering to transition and save colours. Dithering is great if you want to give something texture as well, but not so good for things like metal which is supposed to look smooth. Some artists take it a step further and stylize their dithering making it a trademark in their pieces. In the example above if I had used a traditional checker board dither it would have looked terrible, but with the stylized dither I incorporated it into the piece and really made it mine. There are a ton of ways to dither things and one great example is [this](http://purloux.com/images/artwork/tutorials/rundown/dither2.png) gradient. You can see that using different amounts of one colour and patterning differently you can get some really amazing results. 

For our laser, I am going to base the details inside of the laser on a + shaped pattern. You can see [here](http://imgur.com/SwpWw,hWglP#1) that + shape repeated over and over giving it some real texture. Also [here](http://i.imgur.com/oS3Bm.png) I added a little trail for some extra detail. 

Next on the list is going to be the ammo counter for the laser example. Again, we are going to start with a [outline](http://i.imgur.com/RAxEF.png) and slowly add [colour](http://i.imgur.com/pfsQC.png) and [highlights](http://i.imgur.com/gFJqi.png)

Once you are done your pieces throw them back into your UI template and see how it [looks.](http://i.imgur.com/Li883.png)

These are the most basic basics of pixel art and will get you far enough to finish off that UI example for yourselves. I suggest that you use a simmilar or the same template for your UI, as well as the Palette I linked above. Those participating please post your WIP's in a direct response to this post, and further updates branching off that original post. Anyone wanting to give C&amp;C on work go right ahead as long as it is constructive. Next week we will be talking about Colour picking, and colour ramps.

The basic premise about it is that you start on a spaceship, together with about ~20 other people. Everybody gets assigned a job, (eg. Captain, Scientist, Medical doctor...) 

Your job gives you access to places that you need to perform your tasks (doctors heal other injured players, engineers keep the station running, etc.) 
In addition, one or two players becomes traitors - they need to perform a random, nefarious mission (kill the captain, escape alive!). Ideally, there should be lots of opportunities for the traitor to stealthily sabotage &amp; tamper with the station.

Anyway, screenshots:

1339506462.0,184,self.gamedev,uxv8m,My experiences of making and releasing a game.,209,25,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/uxv8m/my_experiences_of_making_and_releasing_a_game/,"Hey gamedev!

I love videogames, always have, probably always will. When I was a kid, all I wanted to do when i grew up was to make videogames. So I wrote little games at home. I went to school and eventually got a masters degree in computer sience. I worked as a mainstream programmer and saved up money for my grand game making adventure. And then, a year ago, I set off to make my game.

A few days ago I launched it. It's a space combat simulator for Android. It's intended to play very much like my favorite game as a kid, TIE-Fighter. Some of you might even have tried out an early version of it as I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/oxp4e/) it to this subreddit a number of months ago for feedback. The game was well received. I made a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ur9hx/) in /r/gaming with the game's [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vtq6caJ2Czw) which got well over a thousand upvotes and (most) people really seemed to like it.

Now that the dust has settled and I can look it all with a little more clarity it feels bittersweet though. A lot of the comments I got were heartwarming and uplifting but there was also the occasional horrible comment. And by horrible I mean really horrific. Like ""You're an idiot. I hope you die."" type comments. I guess I should have been ready for that (in /r/gaming especially) and not have let it get to me, but when you actually get stuff like that thrown in your face it's harder than you might think to ignore it completely.

There's also the economic aspect of it. I wasn't really expecting to make a lot of (or any) money, but it is a little disheartening that even though the game was so well received the first day, by the second day the number of downloads (both for the demo and full version) shrunk back to virtually nothing.

To be honest, I'm not entirely sure where I'm going with this. I don't want this to be a game promotion post (I considered not including the links above at all). But at the same time I can't help but think that some of you who are making your first game might be interested in hearing of my experiences.

On the technical side I actually did what most of you would consider the cardinal no-no (apart from making an MMO). I wrote my own engine. And I did it in C. The game uses a thin java wrapper which calls the game code using JNI. I also have a corresponding wrapper written in C to run the very same game code natievly in linux on my desktop (without emulation), for testing. A large part of the idea was (perhaps obviously) that a third version of the wrapper could be written in objective-C to run the game on iOS if I should ever decide to port it. The game also uses an internal scripting language of sorts to specify the missions. Here's an [example](http://jannis.homelinux.net/exjobb/consequences_mission.text) of one the games simpler missions, in it's code form, which the game then parses when the mission loads.

All in all it's been a good year. I wont miss working from home with no people but family around though. For the first few months I felt more and more claustrophobic, but after that it started feeling comfortable (which was even more scary). I kept thinking stuff like ""WTF is wrong with me? Am I becoming a hermit?"".

I'll probably keep making games, but less ambitious ones, as a hobby. So don't think I'll stop lurking in this subreddit! :)

Anyway, thanks for reading and sorry for the rant. I'll see you guys around. And best of luck with your games!

Oh and btw: If you happen to have any good tips for jobs in Stockholm which you think might suit me, don't hesitate to let me know ;)

It's taken me about 10 months, 8 of them actually working on the game in my spare time. I desperately hope I was successful in making a challenging, fair, and varied combat system that makes for an exciting and unique brawler.

It made me reflect upon a relatively new issue facing modern game developers: how do you know it is time to quit working on your live game?

In a landscape including free-to-play, mobile, Steam, Ouya, Kickstarter, Desura, alpha funding, etc, there are more ways than ever to release a game and continually improve it. And there are cases, such as [the story of Wild Ones’ ascension to become Playdom’s top performing game](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6362/), which show it is possible to grow your audience through strong game design. But by and large game development is a career of passion, and when it is not just A game but YOUR game out there in the world, it can be impossible to ignore your [sunk costs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs) and objectively decide whether or not to continue working on your game.

Since my team [Quarter Spiral](http://quarterspiral.com) has been self-funded for the past year, I have worked as a monetization design consultant to fund my end of the company while we develop [Enhanced Wars](http://www.enhancedwars.com). Between my work and public lectures, I have talked to a number of game developers about free-to-play games at various stages of life. One of the hardest things to tell someone when evaluating a live game is “I think you should quit” but I have done it several times. There are no hard and fast rules to determine when your free-to-play game has become a lost cause, but here are some thoughts on how to identify if it is time to move on.

**Engagement before monetization**

Many times people ask me to look at their game because they have a monetization problem. For an initial evaluation I both play the game and probe the dev with some questions about the game’s metrics. The dev may think he just needs more users, or that he needs to get more money from the users he has. But as we discuss the metrics it is clear that any work to improve monetization is a premature optimization because player engagement is the real issue.

In free-to-play, a long term relationship with the player is key to monetization. For most games, the majority of players will not return for a second session of play. That is a natural byproduct of a game being free. Wherever your engagement figures are after launch, in general the first few updates for your game are spent fixing unexpected bugs, difficulty spikes in the early game, or other factors to improve the number of returning players.

If you have low engagement numbers despite a number of updates to improve them, it is unlikely to turn around. This is a sign that your game is not fun enough for the audience of organic players you are attracting and it is time to move on.

**Burn rate vs revenue**

Each developer’s economics are different. Metrics that represent a windfall profit for a solo developer working with contractors will get a team of 14 devs sunset at a large studio. If your burn rate (average monthly expenses) is greater than your monthly revenue, you need to evaluate what it will take to start making money with your game and if that level of improvement is realistic.

If you feel that you’ve more or less optimized your engagement rate then you can work to improve existing features or introduce new features that boost revenue. But in many cases these optimizations will be just that – optimizations. Silver bullets that dramatically change your game’s finances happen, but they are rare.

If you’ve never done the exercise, look at your expenses and figure out your burn rate. Then look at your game’s monthly revenue and what it will take from a metrics perspective to get in the black. For example, if your conversion to paying users is currently below 0.5% and you need to improve it to 3% in order to start making a profit that is an unlikely optimization. If you are new to forecasting revenue, you can use my [interactive forecast calculator](https://apps.facebook.com/forecastquest/) to do the rough math.

Evaluating your burn rate vs revenue sounds like a no brainer, but I have been surprised at the number of devs I’ve talked to about monetization only to discover they do not have a firm grasp on their finances. Being realistic about your finances and evaluating them on a weekly or monthly basis will help you decide when it is time to move on.

**Paid advertising can’t save you**

More than once I’ve talked to a game developer with revenue losing metrics considering a paid advertising campaign to attract new users and turn their game around. When this happens, I try and run them through the numbers, figure out approximate lifetime revenue per player, ballpark the acquisition cost per player and show them how much money they are likely to lose on advertising.

If you are an average game dev and not a player acquisition targeting expert, your metrics are unlikely to improve when you are paying for users in comparison to your organic new players. In fact, acquired players will generally perform worse than your organic players. If you are considering an advertising push in the hopes of turning your game around and the numbers do not add up, it is best for you to spend that money on the next game.

**Quitting is hard**

If you are driven enough to see a game through to ship, then you probably have trouble admitting it is time to give up. As the Freakanomics episode explains, though difficult, quitting your free-to-play game may be the best decision for you. It is hard to be objective, ignore your emotional attachment to a game and admit that it is just not working, but quitting something broken is the only way you will find yourself working on the right game.",,False,,t5_2qi0a,False,,,True,t3_1jcjh1,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1jcjh1/know_when_to_fold_em_how_to_quit_your_live/,

I freaking love old games. I have an [arcade in my house](http://barrysarcade.com). So, I knew we had to do *something* that had to do with video games.

Last week, wedding guests received printed save the date cards in the mail with specific information about or wedding. When, where... that sort of thing. Along with the card, they got a vintage style [video game flyer](http://i.imgur.com/jfgEp.jpg) that directed them to a URL for the game. 

The game doesn't actually have specific information about our wedding, so anyone can play it.

The game is a NES-style platformer, kind of like Mario or Mega Man. You play as the miniature cake topper versions of my fiancé or myself (your pick) as you climb a huge wedding cake, make your way through presents, and a few other wedding inspired levels. The main villain of the game is an emotionless robot with a circular saw blade for an arm. The smaller bad guys are various hors d'oeuvres that we hate: Shrimp, Deviled Eggs and Broccoli. Our yellow lab, Olive, serves as a guide. 

This concept for this game kind of built over time. In the beginning, it was just a printed card that was drawn in an 8-bit style. No game involved. The color palette is our wedding's color palette. Then, I wanted to see if I could build a one-level mini game, using what little I knew of FlashPunk. When that was done, one level didn't seem like enough...it was too short. So, I built a few more levels, and realized the game needed some sort of story. I realized pretty early that this project had gotten out of control, and instead of dialing down the scope (which is my typical reaction), I just went for it. I created... and created, and it was a great experience.

Minus the music, I build the whole thing. Katie (my fiancé) helped out with some of the background patterns and story, and I guess my dog offered up moral support. Most of the music tracks were custom made by [Derris Kharlan] (http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wgwu9/its_rent_time_so_i_need_more_work_who_wants_some/) who did an amazing job. I can't recommend him enough. Reddit user bFusion posted this [free-to-use track](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/14cxm4/free_happy_chiptune_track_i_wrote_a_while_ago/) a few weeks ago and it worked perfectly as a main title theme.

I've been building this on and off since mid-august. This is my second full game, the first being an iPad game about stacking pancakes. 

I want people to play this game. I'm really proud of it. It's free. I'm not making a dime from this. Please share it with anyone you want.

[Pixel Champions](http://www.pixelchampions.com) is now complete (formerly 8bitDungeons) and it's looking for some feedback (positive or negative). I've been working hard this past month to act on the advice given since my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/106tne/i_made_an_mmorpg_8bitdungeons_howd_i_do/) (specifically the advice to rename the project, and to [make a gameplay video](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/106tne/i_made_an_mmorpg_8bitdungeons_howd_i_do/c6b6koz)), and I'm ready for more.

Pixel Champions is a tile-based 2D indie MMORPG that is capable of supporting hundreds of players online in a single persistant game-world. There's three classes to choose from (Knight/Archer/Mage), and there's no max level or skill (you can level until you cause an integer overflow on the server).

The entire project (minus some artwork that I contracted out) was done solely by me (in my spare time over the past decade). It was written in C# using the express editions of Visual Studio 2010, and is hosted on a Windows VPS that I'm renting from GoDaddy.

Yes the code is obfuscated (using [obfuscar](http://code.google.com/p/obfuscar/)), I'm also using [.NET CodeReflect](http://www.devextras.com/decompiler/) to validate the obfuscation of every build. The gameclient uses [OpenTK](http://www.opentk.com/) to provide a binding to OpenGL from C#, and [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com) to run game on Linux and Mac OS X. While on this subject (I love getting technical), the source code is under revision control (SVN using TortoiseSVN client), and the game server uses MSSQL (express edition) to store account/character data.

| Language   | Files    | Code Lines     | Comment Lines |

| T-SQL       |   36 sp |    *1292*   |   706

My focus now is porting the game to iOS (doing a rewrite rather than licensing MonoGame, since my long term plan is to develop solely for iOS in the near future).

And lastly, between September 10 - October 10 I recieved enough account upgrades (from Pixel Champions) to pay the hosting costs for nearly all of next year (I think it's safe to say the project is self-sustaining).

I've been on just about every programming community out there, however, there seems to be a bit of a hole.

I'm wondering how much interest there is in a graphics specific community. Help, tutorials, samples and discussion specifically on the topic of graphics and graphics related math in C++, C#, Java, DirectX, OpenGL, etc. *No engines like Unity or UDK* (unless they're coding engines like OGRE perhaps?).

The reason I ask is because I have experience as a webmaster and, professionally, I am a graphics programmer and it seems to me that there is a severe lack in understanding graphics (yes, NeHe and all that are great, but do you really understand what a modelview projection matrix is and what it does?).

I also want to know what you guys think should be included in the website (galleries, tutorials, snippets, discussion boards are obvious ones but what else?). Everything would be community oriented. You can post questions and answers, tutorials and snippets all of which could be 'featured/sponsored' on the frontpage. I was also thinking of some type of reward system for posting content and also a way of differentiating between 'expert' members.

So what do you say reddit? Is this worth investing in? I already have a domain which is sitting dormant waiting for a project like this. I'm also open to more suggestions, so post your thoughts!

**TL;DR** I have time and money to waste, want to set up a help forum specifically for graphics programming. Good idea or bad idea?

**Edit:**
I've gotten a fairly good response about this. I'm going ahead with the project. Please keep throwing your ideas in!

I'll let you guys know when I've got something up and running.

**Edit #2:** This idea seems a lot more popular than I had originally thought! I've got a small website thrown together for now, but it looks like I'm going to have to create something custom for all the content I want to add. Nevertheless, I should have something basic set up for you guys soon (sometime this weekend maybe).

Thanks for all the responses. Please keep posting your ideas and criticisms, it's really helping me figure out what I need to make this successful.

Well as the title suggests, [Amazon is offering](http://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2013/01/22/Amazon-offers-new-service-for-monetizing-free-to-play-games.aspx) to process payments for F2P games.

So why would small and indie game developers give a damn about a new payment processor?

Well two big reasons.

First off, we all like getting paid, and most of us hate giving out our credit card information on the internet, but people trust Amazon, probably already have their credit card information registered.  Having a trust payment choice is certainly good for conversion.

Second, and this is the biggie, your game or DLC will **show up on Amazon.com**.

That is HUGE.  Amazon.com gets an enormous number of eyeballs.  It's the 8th most visited site in the world, and the 5th most visited site in the US.

One of the big problems that indie and smaller developers experience is getting exposure.  This could prove to be a huge help for these people.

The store is already online, and a couple high profile games ( AirMech and Second Life ) are prominently featured.



So... if you are looking for a way to monetize your game, looking to increase your exposure, or simply want a different payment processor, Amazon Game Connect might be a very good fit.

Sadly, there isn't a ton more information available for developers, you have to email them for me info. Hopefully this changes in time.

**Part 3: Hungry Skeletons**

YouTube Video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=cwRo_kM19Ek

Today I'm going to talk about some behaviours that are specific to the Skeleton monster. The idea is that while Skeletons are not chasing or pursuing the player, they are always hungry and will seek out corpses to consume. Eating helps the Skeleton regain lost health, and also if left long enough, consumed corpses turn into more undead Skeletons! We build upon all of the behaviours discussed in the previous articles to do this.

The procedure is as follows:

1 .The Skeleton is in non-alert mode (character is not in line of sight, and there are no detected breadcrumbs) and so it proceeds to patrolling the waypoints using simple A* pathfinding as before. If while in patrol mode the Skeleton detects a corpse it will set the corpse as its destination and proceed to run directly to it using the Seek Steering Behaviour.

2 . If a player is detected, the Skeleton will switch out of this mode and chase the player instead in full alert mode. Skeletons ALWAYS prioritise the player over eating corpses.

3 . When the Skeleton reaches the corpse, it will begin eating it. The eaten variable for this corpse increments every frame. While eating, the Skeleton's field of view is reduced to 45 degrees instead of 90, this is to give the impression that the Skeletons are busy eating to notice much else. Also, it is still in non-alert mode and will not smell any breadcrumbs. This opens up gameplay opportunities such as sneaking around a group of Skeletons who are busy munching!

4 . When the eaten variable exceeds a certain amount (ie. 200) the corpse is completely consumed. At this point some corpses (such as Orc corpses) turn into more Skeletons! This has the effect of a large cluster of corpses quickly propagating into multiple Skeletons, so the player has to make sure this doesn't happen!

5 . At that's it, nice and simple behaviour made possible by combining and tweaking the previous behaviours in a certain way. This is the beauty of behaviour trees, it is quick and easy to create new meta-behaviours by combining the building blocks of the previous ones.

**The Next Few Days**

As some of you may already know - my game TinyKeep is on Kickstarter and there are currently only 7 days left of funding to go! If you enjoy reading these kinds of technical articles, please consider pledging so I can continue active development of the game. Currently I have accrued almost half the amount I need, but as Kickstarter is all or nothing I need to make the full £22k or I lose all my pledges so far. If I get funded, I plan to keep on releasing articles on all aspects of the game's development, including AI but also game mechanics, procedural generation, multiplayer networking, 3D graphics &amp; animation, performance optimization, workflow - and everything in between! So please help if you can!

1340309799.0,167,self.gamedev,vedcc,10 steps to the top paid 25 overall on App Store,240,73,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/vedcc/10_steps_to_the_top_paid_25_overall_on_app_store/,"We here in Piston Games just launched Gemibears for iOS and after few days break through to top paid 25 overall in US. 

http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gemibears/id471855200?mt=8

This was really hard and interesting, so I would like to share with you our experience. There are 10 steps to get top paid 25 overall in US:

**1) Make great game and prepare great marketing**
You need to spend on marketing as many time as you spend on development. Bad app can be pulled to top by great marketing, but when your campaign will end — app will be dramatically dropped down. This is what you see every day in top free charts with lot of farms that makes rocket jump because of great marketing and falling to nowhere another day. So you must make great game.

**2) Test your gameplay**
But game must be great not just for you — because what you make is already great, otherwise you wouldn't do it, right? Every developer just love his game because it's like a child and sometimes you just not strict enough to your child. So test your game a lot — give it to your friends or even strangers. And don't ask anything — just look at their reactions and make conclusions about mistakes and advances.

**3) Catch all bugs** 
Test game on different devices and firmwares. The worst thing you can have is a great game with bad review, because of some bug. Don't release unfinished product. And have some support page, like getsatisfaction, so people will tell your about bugs not by App Store reviews, but on your support page.

And if you miss some bug — use [expedited review](https://developer.apple.com/appstore/contact/appreviewteam/index.html). You can use it once a year, but it really helpful — about one day and update with fixes will be on App Store.

**4) Don't make lite version**
It's boring and player will have to pass through same levels in full version if he buy it. But you need free version for players who would like to try your game! So make something special — we call it Gemibears Mini. It's free prequel for Gemibears, it have completely different planets, levels and additional game mode — all these features are original and don't appear in paid version. Same way was made Trainyard Express and Hambo Begins. Different content for free is a best way to show your game and have positive response from players, because you don't cut anything from the game — you add something new to it.

Remember that your paid and free (not light!) versions — are separate products. Free will help you with promotion of paid, but you need to promote free somehow. So plan your marketing for both free and paid versions.

**5) Cross promo and ad**
Make cross promo with other cool games. Gemibears have promo screens, buttons and so on in different games from our friends. This is not about money, more about your connections. Send email with cross-promo proposition to games you like, or even travel to another city for meeting with their developers. Because support from other great games will give you lot of downloads.

Connect all your previous games by some cross-promo module. You can make in house solution or use something like chartboost — but 3rd party solutions are not flexible at all.

Use paid ad — but use it carefully. Buy iOS ad ONLY. No web, no magazines, videos or anything else outside device. You can buy installs for free app in [chartboost](http://www.chartboost.com/) or buy ad spot directly in Backflip, EA or Zynga games using [Burstly](http://www.burstly.com/), but be careful planning your budget. 

**6) Make something that will generate new users from inside of your game**
We have twitter community in Gemibears and Facebook connect in Gemibears Mini. Both give an option to attract new players, because community is always great idea and attract new people, and by connecting your friends to the game you can gain additional content.

**7) Make all marketing efforts in one day**
Don't spread it for month or even week. We release Gemibears few days before all marketing and have no downloads at all. But after using all marketing that we prepare in just 3 days — top 25 occupied!

**8) Icon, screenshots and trailer**
You need a genius icon. Most of people make decision about buying or not your game just by looking at it icon. We make about 26 different variants of Gemibears icon before we considered it good enough. Great, to be honest.

Other really important part — App Store screenshots. Actually, they aren't just screenshots — they are banners. Most of people don't read description, so take each screen and tell about key game features on it. Be brief and persuasive. Not ""unique gameplay"", but ""match-2"" — this is truly unique!   

[Official trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akd-n9IgHGg). If you don't make it — some youtube teen will record video from shaking hands and all people will see the game as it looks at this video.

**9) After release buzz**
Don't underestimate any additional free buzz that you can make. Register your game in [Facebook App Center](https://www.facebook.com/appcenter/) if you have any fb functionality. Submit your icon (it's must be great, do you remember?) to [iOS icon gallery](http://iosicongallery.com/games/gemibears/) sites. Make TouchArcade forum post — in upcoming section before release, in discussions right after or even make some contest!

Don't expect Apple feature on App Store. You can't control featuring process, so concentrate on making great game and marketing. 

Don't expect Press will admire your game for first time, even if you have a great game. Press and blogger like success stories, so you will have press after success, not before it.

But you have to write to everyone. Make not just text letter, but some custom html template or at least image banner for header of the letter. This way we have TUAW game of the week for our previous The Screetch game. They ignore our text letter with promocode, so we make nice-looking picture, send a latter again and — it works!

Its fake, of course, but it got me thinking: what would it take to make a real version of this?

So, I set about learning node.js and integrated it with a flash front end (rather than html5, because I can't stand javascript).

The following is the first open test of the very first version of my attempt - its currently going to be a bandwidth hog, because I'm not doing any interest management and it will probably only handle a few connection because I'm ttying a load of stuff to the console, but lets see how it goes:

My plan for the story is that you're a processor in a computer and somehow a virus got in. You'll have to run through various zones with different challenges and puzzles whilst the virus-infested level is falling apart around you, and at the end of each level there'll be a little terminal where you repair a part of the computer, reconnecting a broken conduit and unlocking another level.

The gameplay isn't really fluid or exciting yet, but it's been coming together nicely so far. I plan on adding in more things to the environment, such as spikes, doors, buttons, rails, swings, and turret enemies.

1347888472.0,160,self.gamedev,100rl5,If you've ever want to proceduraly generate a texture on an arbitrarily perturbed sphere I have some helpful information for you,197,37,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/100rl5/if_youve_ever_want_to_proceduraly_generate_a/,"This is a problem I've been stuck for a good week or so on.  I finally got a result I'm happy with, and in the odd case any of you end up wanting to attempt something similar, I figured the results might be of help.

Basically, I'm creating a landscape inside of a sphere.  One common technique when texturing a landscape is to blend together a few repeating sub-textures based upon elevation, incline, etc, etc, in order to make the landscape interesting without needing some 4096x4096 monster texture which is pre-rendered for the entire landscape.  Inside a sphere, this gets a lot harder, because there's no obvious way to seamlessly repeat rectangles around a sphere.

1. [The naive approach](http://i.imgur.com/dkGuY.jpg)

I generated rectangles based upon latitude and longitude.  Half the problem here is that I forgot to make my textures seamless.  The bigger problem is that you end up with uneven texture stretching, based upon altitude changes, and then, especially along the poles.  Also, a nasty seam which is a pain to get rid of.

2.  [Texture every small triangle individually without worrying about seems](http://imgur.com/a/SnzSA)

You get some prettier results this way in general.  You never get stretched texture because each triangle is given UV coordinates separately with exact sizing based upon that triangle.  Not too bad, but the issue here, is that especially up close, the individual triangles are all very distinct because their edges do not match up.

3.  [A play on cube-mapping inspired by an NVIDIA article](http://i.imgur.com/BdjXP.jpg)

Finally!  You don't get any obvious texture stretching, nor do you see individual triangles.  Instead everything looks smooth and well  blended.

The only issue here is that the individual texture repetitions are pretty obvious.  Once I sub out my current sample textures for some larger samples (and turn down my UV multiplier) this will look near perfect.


So for those of you who want to do something like this, here is what I did:
Cube-map the sphere.  For a vertices off to the left (large -X), you know that the Y and Z coordinates will be varying the most, along with the smallest change in X coordinate.  Therefore, you generate the texture coordinate as VertexPosition.YZ * MyUVRepeatingMultiplier.

For textures towards the top, you know Y won't change much, and you do VertexPosition.XZ * MyUVRepeatingMultiplier.  Likewise, for front and back you use VertexPosition.XY instead.

This doesn't look too bad, but two problems:
1.  You get seams at the transition points between ""faces"" of the cube.
2.  The texture is all stretched out on highly vertical faces.  For example, on a steep cliff off to our left, we are choosing VertexPosition.YZ, when the steepness towards the center means VertexPosition.XY might be a better choice of coordinate.



How to solve the seams:
Rather than choose ONE coordinate based upon which plane the vertex is closest too, we choose THREE texture coordinates, one for each plane, and blend together.  So you end up saying

TextureColor = Texture.sample(VertexPosition.XZ) * abs(VertexPosition.Y) + Texture.sample(VertexPosition.YZ) * abs(VertexPosition.X) + Texture.sample(VertexPosition.XY) * abs(VertexPosition.Z) / (Total of X + Y + Z)


All of a sudden everything looks a really good, except for stretching on cliffs and steep mountains.  Luckily, this is a really easy fix:
Rather than using ""abs(VertexPosition.X/Y/Z)"" as your blending factor, you use ""abs(VertexNormal.X/Y/Z)""  You don't actually care, which plane the vertex lies closest to positionally, rather which plane its triangles lie closest to angularly.  Now flat surfaces off to the left are correctly weighted towards the YZ plane, while steep surfaces off to the left are more accurately weighted words the XZ or XY plane.


The one downside to this approach, is that you are using at a minimum 3 texture samples per pixel rendered, while, if you are blending two samples together based upon altitude at each point, you are doing 6 texture samples per pixel rendered.  On other hand, my 2 year old laptop which was pretty cheap at the time can render this full-screen at 200 fps, so it's likely an ok thing to do unless you are targeting old Intel graphics chips.




EDIT:  If the triangles in your sphere have per-face normals rather than smoothed per-vertex normals, this probably won't look as good.  Be sure that each vertex has a normal which is the average of the normals of the faces surrounding it.",,False,,t5_2qi0a,1347897374.0,,,True,t3_100rl5,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/100rl5/if_youve_ever_want_to_proceduraly_generate_a/,

1349252128.0,157,self.gamedev,10v6s2,Are these normal working conditions for an indie developer?,191,34,210,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/10v6s2/are_these_normal_working_conditions_for_an_indie/,"There are only a few people at this startup that I was just hired to as an artist doing mostly vector art and concepts. The person directly above me is fine, I get what I feel is normal quality control from him but the owner of the company seems to have ridiculously unreasonable standards.

Whenever I take a concept or a game asset to him, he simply stares blankly at it for 10 seconds and then announce that ""it's ugly"" and simply tells me to redo it without any sort of explanation as to what is wrong with it. When I ask what it is that needs to be changed, his answers are so vague that they provide no information whatsoever about what needs to be fixed, so I often have to do and redo the same piece from scratch several times making random changes in the hopes that I will hit the mark at some point. My friend also does programming (like my boss) but is currently a student with people under him working on a game. He has to manage these people on a much larger scale project and despite having the artistic talent of a 10 year old (his words, not mine) he is able to perfectly express exactly what he is looking for in every piece and his artists are able to hit the nail on the head every time because of this.

To make matters worse, even if an asset has been approved, if he sees that same asset with a different decal overlay on it, he will say that it doesn't fit properly and demands that I redo it. (I've had this happen with one particular asset several times where he will tell me to revert a change that he made me make to an already finalized asset only to tell me to revert it again the next day.)

Another thing I've noticed is that if he is employing some sort of project management, no one else knows about it because he tells everyone at the start of the day what he thinks should be done and then just expects it to be completed. No mention of agile or any software management methods. There is no input from anyone, not even my superior who is in charge of all of the artists in the company; we are all expected to do exactly what the boss asks without question. He recently came out and said that because we now have 3 artists and 3 programmers, he is expecting 3 separate games (albeit clones of the company's most recent game) to be made within **two weeks**, all with different visuals. Every day I have to make up to 6 finalized, *highly detailed* assets (see below for an example) within the 9 hour day, which I then have to take home and end up working on another 5 hours until midnight before I have to crash in time to be up for work again in the morning; and they still get rejected. There are no concepts for these pieces either, I'm working with nothing and he doesn't even want to see anything but a completed piece. I'm called lazy if I do a simple sketch to get a feel for what he's looking for or told that it needs color for him to decide so if I'm asked to make an asset, I have to to it start to finish before he ever even sees it.

We're working on mobile games as well and yet he constantly nitpicks about small details that wouldn't even be seen if they took up the entire phone screen, let alone 3/4 of an inch of screen-space. He also has this really ridiculous idea that we're supposed to be on the same level as a company like Zynga which has hundreds of employees and yes, he has actually made this comparison between our company and theirs.

Here is an example of 2 of the 8 assets I have to do today which is *still* not approved. Again this is for a mobile phone game so actual viewing size would be between 3/4""-1"" and I am not under any NDA.

For developers looking to work on a 3D project, there are a daunting number of 3D engines available for your use.  This guide attempts to make the process of choosing a bit easier.

On a single page, there are (currently) 20 engines with the following details:

* Supported platform (for dev tools)
* Target platforms
* Link to engine
* Price
* Books available, if applicable
* Sample published games
* Cost
* Programming language(s) supported
* Key site links ( generally docs/wiki and forum if available )


Hope you find it useful.  I tried to list all of the engines in most common use, but of course I may have missed some.  I focused exclusively on *finished* engines, generally with shipping products, as there are literally hundreds of engines out there in a semi-finished state.  As to the game examples, they were chosen pretty much at random by me.  Engines are listed in alphabetic order, and the list is submitted without bias ( at least, that is the intention ).

If you think another engine should be included on the list, spot a mistake I made or have any other general comments, please let me know!  I want to keep the list as accurate as possible to keep it a useful resource for developers.  At the same time, I don't really want to fill it with cruft.

I made a couple questionable decisions.  I am not sure if the C4 Engine should or shouldn't be included; it is seemingly popular, but the wiki being written by fans and the inability to find much solid information made it hard to tell ( I have no experience with the engine personally ).  The community seems large and active enough though.

I was also unable to discern the current status of the Gamebryo engine, the company went under and was purchased by another company, but I cannot tell if it is still available for licensing, please confirm if you know.

The same holds true for iDTech 4; with iD's purchase by Zenimax, I cannot tell if the older tech is still available to be licensed ( the newest engine sure isn't ).  If anyone can confirm or deny, please let me know.  The source is obviously still available, but I need to confirm if you can create a commercial game using it.

Finally, the Nebula Device made the list, because, well... I really like the Nebula device and well... a list of 19 doesn't sound as good! :)  It is rather outdated and unsupported, although products have been shipped using it, rather recently even, and full sourcecode is available.

I opted not to include Crystal Space; although it has been around forever and seems to have potential, in all that time I have never seen a released game with it.  I also left off all truely outdated engines, like earlier iDTech revisions, the Build Engine, LithTech, etc.

Oh and for some stupid reason, I authored it in Word 2010, which was a gigantic mistake.  As a result, the fonts can look a bit... off in Chrome.  Hopefully I will find the cause soon enough.

Hope some of you find it useful!  I have a similar engine in the works for 2D engines as well.

[Dusty Revenge](http://www.dustyrevenge.com) is something we have been working on for slightly over 18 months, and we think it's about time we show it to the world. :) And we would love to hear what you think about it.

First off, the video and screenshots are slightly outdated as we have changed a few things in UI and character's weapon. We'll be doing an update within the next month (we hope). But what you see is indicative and should give you a good sense of the game.

Apart from the awesome graphics, the unique part of this game is that you have 2 supporting characters, an artillery guy and a sniper that you can call upon to help you. You will see what I mean in the video. 

We are working hard to wrap things up in the next few months and wrapping things up is really the hardest things to do, so any tips are welcome!

My name is Adrian, aka [TheIndieGamePromoter](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheIndieGamePromoter), and I have been creating Let's Plays for various small and large independent developers, to help promote their work through social media. My main focus is on YouTube, but I also use the power of FB, Twitter, reddit, etc. I've been posting on this subreddit for a little while now and some of you might remember me.

The reason I started the channel was because I noticed that there are Let's Players out there that play indie games and even do requests, but the very small developers or ones that do not have too much popularity never get their chance to be featured on a channel. I am here to help those guys out.

&gt; Here are some examples of games I've featured:  
* Terminally Ill by Sebastian Lague: http://youtu.be/o0mSp53h88s  
* Mystic Crusade by For Better or for Worse Games: http://youtu.be/YoqBZojbMDQ  
* Kingsport Cases by Machines in Motion: http://youtu.be/RFgEMBjnFoc  
* Delver by Priority Interrupt: http://youtu.be/BqwVGXtUXds  

A lot of the time I like to discuss information about the game and the developer while I play your game. So the easiest way for me to have everything is to submit your game to me through this form here: http://www.indiegamefarm.com/submit-your-game/

That site is one Weasel of [WeaselZone](http://www.youtube.com/user/WeaselZone) and I created to host our videos from our channels and to make it easier for submissions of developer's games. The form may look intimidating, but it's quite easy, and most of the text on there are disclaimers and such.

I've seen some very interesting stuff on here and would love to continue featuring your games for the world to see. My channel is growing fast and I have a lot of plans for you guys in the coming months.

Can't wait to see what you guys have in store.

Take care and stay indie,

Originally I posted this to /r/PixelArt, but I did have plans for posting it here as it addresses many issues specific to proper game design. Also since it mostly goes over techniques and coloring rather than how to draw forms, it can be helpful for those of us who prefer more simplistic ""programmer"" drawings by still making them interesting albeit their simplicity.

This is meant to be a look through of the GameBoy Advance game ""Final Fantasy Tactics: Advance"", specifically focused on the art and what made it as good as it was. So, without further ado, let us get started.

Let's start with the main concept behind all art:

**Color &amp; Light**


The game uses a style of saturated darks &gt; pastel mediums &gt; unsaturated lights, which is a fairly normal and highly recommended palette choice.

&gt;[Scene 1](http://i.imgur.com/WS4DitF.png)

As you can see by the picture above, it has a single color theme throughout the scene: Blue, to violet, to purple, with minor white and green influences. (the snow and the sidewalks)

These other influences are hardly noticeable though, the green seems to be cyan, and the snow seems to be blue even though overall it is just a flat white. This is caused by the *amount* of colors which donate to the main theme being used around it. Unsaturated colors like white and the bright green they chose will, in a way, absorb the colors that are around them. These can be considered almost free colors, colors you can throw in your theme that will look good anywhere due to their absorbing nature.

As you will notice throughout this post, the game uses very little dithering, which is good. Dithering is best when used sparingly, as the texture it forms is very eye catching, and too much can just create unnecessary clutter.

&gt;[Scene 2](http://i.imgur.com/RqlOkf6.png)

In this picture you can see that the overall theme of the level is yellow, to brown, to white, with some minor greens. (The doors and windows - everything adds to the theme.)

As is good with almost any shadow or light, the shadows in this level are tinted blue and the lights are tinted yellow, this is always good for sunny areas as it is an effect that the sun itself is creating.

If you look on the sides of the dirt tiles in the bottom left and middle left, you will see that dithering *is* used on these parts. It is a very small amount, but just enough to create the ""this is dirt"" texture they wanted.

If you will also note, the palette choice for the environment is always just a little bit less saturated than the characters standing on it. This creates emphasis on the characters, and while the background is still vibrant, it is not confused with things which the player can interact with.

Notice the white cloth as well, they have 6 different hues of their overall color: white. Normally a cloth that is white would be only white, you would think, but one thing to always remember: 

**Perfect greyscales will ALWAYS be boring to look at.**

And as well as just being plain boring, light from the surroundings reflects, so obviously white would not remain white in a primarily brown/yellow area. To remedy this, as the cloth gets darker, it dips closer to a brown color, with some purple-blue in the middle to account for the previously mention blue tint on shadows.

&gt;[Scene 2: Night](http://i.imgur.com/uEPbY1y.png)

This is the same scene as before, but later in the game, at night time. If you will notice which colors have changed to which, you can see how much of a difference light has on the overall color of a theme. The theme of this level has been changed from Yellow&gt;Brown&gt;White to Blue&gt;Green&gt;Purple.

This has been done by changing the cloth to purple, moving the grass to a green, and changing all the walls to a 
purple-ish blue color. And really, these color changes don't mean very much for what you should always do when changing a day lit area to a night time area; no, what is important is the relative warmth of the color choices. What was once a very warm, even hot feeling area, is now a cool, mysterious area. Color choice means everything, and generally cool (as in temperature), mysterious, or evil are what night time represents.

Also worth noting is that anytime scenery from closer to the screen would overlap scenery far away, a dark outline is added to the edge of the closer scenery to put emphasis on that distance. This, along with the use of shadows to give realistic looking 3D objects, adds depth and supports the illusion of a 3D world.

&gt;[Scene 3](http://i.imgur.com/GRjsMSw.png)

This levels theme is Blue&gt;grey&gt;purple, with some minor green/yellow. (The plants and various gold ornaments.)

If you look closely, you will see that in order to maintain the overall theme for this level, gold was outlined with a dark blue instead of brown, and greens were outlined with a dark purple rather than a dark green. Doing this keeps synergy between the colors even when they may seem far apart.

Add on to that note of synergy, a quick look at this picture and you can see it is mostly grey, then blue. But there are very few colors upon closer inspection that are actually grey in this picture, once again going with the theme of never, ever, using flat greyscales. If you brought up the palette for the concrete tiles used on this level, it would look brown. However, the apparent grey illusion is kept by simply using more of the unsaturated colors and using very sparingly the dark, saturated browns in the palette. This is **very good**, it keeps the picture vivid and interesting while still properly representing the color they had chosen.


**Characters**


If you look back on the characters in the scenes we just went over, you will notice a few things.

1. Character palettes do not reflect their surroundings.

2. Regardless of the brightness/darkness of the area, character palettes are once again, unaffected.

3. All characters are outlined with thin, pitch black lines. This is accompanied by a circle of the same color around their feet.

4. Characters are more saturated than their surroundings.

What this does is, quite simply, makes characters stand out from their surroundings **by a lot**. And this is a big part of the style in this game, it is easy on the eyes. Outlines tell you where things are, and they also make sure you know where the things you care about are.

&gt;[Character Sheet](http://i.imgur.com/QB8RrWF.png)

Notice the anatomy of the characters, it looks pretty good and it is easy to see that they are humanoid. But look a little closer; they stand with their feet a lot wider apart than any normal person, and they hold their hands much further out to the sides than you would see of a normal person. This works for three reasons:

1. Every single character looks like this. It looks a lot more reasonable when every single character is based off of the same anatomy.

2. It is easier to represent a character in such a small sprite when they are holding their limbs further from their body.

3. The body is stretched a small amount to give the illusion that the limbs aren't being held out oddly, and with this you never notice.

This is an incredibly intelligent decision; they have more room to work with, more detail, and an easier time animating. Remember this if you ever find yourself drawing low resolution characters. Also a little tip for ever making your own characters like this, the anatomy is kind of like an egg with a head.


**Interface**


This has more to do with design rather than art, but if your art is drawing classy looking menus, don't skip this.

&gt;[Example](http://i.imgur.com/Y7cbGyi.png)

The font used in the menus is the same font that is used in dialogue, with one key difference - it is white with a black outline instead of black with no outline. The soul reason for this is to allow **more freedom** in the GUI. By using heavier contrast fonts, they were able to make a more detailed and interestingly colored inventory screen without distracting players from the text.

Notice how there are also bubble letter versions of the base font. This font is used primarily for important things, such as stats. These bubble letters come with their own shading as well; they are shaded light at the top slowly gradating to a darker hue, with some anti-aliasing on the edges where black just wouldn't work.

Also notice how the HP, MP, and JP lettering creates a shining effect simply by alternating where the light is coming from on each letter.


**Portraits**


&gt;[Example](http://i.imgur.com/MRBYoY9.png)

As you no doubt noticed, every character in the game has it's own portrait, with noticeable more detail put into it than, really, any other part of the game. This is done in a few ways:

1. First, most importantly, each color used in the portraits is given more hues, ranging from 6-7 hues of the same color. This makes the transition smoother, and you end up with very smooth shiny looking portraits.

2. Second, rather than the normal outlines used in the game, the portraits are different in that there outlines mirror the color they are outlining rather than just being a solid color the whole way. When the outline is outlining a dark white, it is black; however when it outlines a lighter white, it is dark brown, and when around blue, it is dark blue. This also adds to the smoothness of the portrait.

3. Third and by no means the least important, the colors used in the portrait are *softer* than those used in the characters sprite for in-game action. This makes the picture more pleasing to look at: Saturation is good in that it adds vibrancy and interest, but used too much on larger pictures and it **hurts**.

Other than those basic uses of outline and color, the artists who made the game know how to draw the characters they are showing the player. This is mainly a look at how they represented their forms so well, I'm not sure in my abilities to teach *how* to draw in the first place.

One more thing worth noting about the portraits, which applies to many mediums and not just art, is that they start from just above breast area and go up from there. This is **very** important, much more important than you would think. By giving the character from a little under the shoulders and up, you can tell they are human (or at least humanoid, in this moogles case). **NEVER** give your player floating heads. Unless your character actually *is* a floating head, then I suppose it's fine.


**On Shiny Things**


The look at the game is basically done now, but I feel the need to go over shiny things, as I only recently came to fully understand how light affects them.

&gt;First off, we have **very shiny, very glossy** metals. These generally have very bright, unsaturated colors, with sudden high saturation dark spots that appear in the middle of curves with almost no gradation.

&gt;[Example](http://i.imgur.com/5lIKpjH.png)

&gt;Second, there are objects with **high gloss but not much shine**. These tend to have darker palettes than it's glossy and shiny brethren, and instead of dark spots appearing in the middle of curves, they appear more near the edge as light isn't quite as reflective on this surface.

&gt;[Example](http://i.imgur.com/jwOZi0Y.png)

&gt;Third, metals that are **shiny but not glossy**. Rather than being light with dark spots, these are inverse. They have fairly normal palettes, but instead of having dark patches in the middle of curves, they have light in the middle of curves.

&gt;[Example](http://i.imgur.com/tsjK2kr.png)


**Some Basic Color Palettes**

For those that may have a bit of trouble grasping the color theory still, I'll give some example palettes the game used to represent specific colors.

1. Cyan&gt;Blue&gt;Purple&gt;White was used to represent blue objects.

2. Brown&gt;Orange&gt;Yellow&gt;White was used to represent gold objects.

3. Black&gt;Low Saturation Green&gt;Low Saturation Blue&gt;Light Pastel Blue&gt;White was used to represent grey objects in GUIs.

4. Violet&gt;Pastel Red&gt;Unsaturated Red&gt;White was used to represent red objects.

5. High Saturation Brown&gt;Low Saturation Purple&gt;Grey&gt;White was used to represent white objects.

6. Light Unsaturated Cyan&gt;Very Light, Very Unsaturated Cyan&gt;White was used to represent ""whoosh"" effects for when characters swung their weapons.

One final hint on coloring objects, having to do with where to place the colors, relates back to the shiny metals. Why are you coloring each one differently? It's because of the specific properties of the object. 

Try to imagine what the properties of what you are coloring are, if you can't picture how light would affect it, look up images of things that share those properties. Reference pictures can be infinitely useful, even in a medium as small resolution as pixel art.


**That's All!**


That about wraps it up. I'm sure there is a lot I missed, because really, the art in this game is superb. But I did my best, and I hope you come out of this understanding color and lighting better!

Basically, Subvein is a top-down multiplayer shooter. It was heavily inspired by games like GTA, Counter Strike and Diablo. It has guns and vehicles, all the standard game modes like CTF and deathmatch, and a rather sexy skills system. There are 33 skills to choose from including stuff like Regeneration, Invisibility, Bullet Time and Force Fields. Basically you run around completing objectives and shooting eachother, and as you kill enemies you'll level up. This gives you a skill point that you can invest into a skill and so on.

Anyway, I'm just a bit excited about finally releasing this and so yeah, come play! I hope you enjoy it and as always feedback and suggestions are welcome :)

1360277553.0,145,self.gamedev,183e50,Going Down With This Ship: My Kickstarter Experience,174,29,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/183e50/going_down_with_this_ship_my_kickstarter/,"Hi /r/gamedev,

In December I mustered up the courage to put together a [Kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/108259147/game-of-inches). This has been more than a struggle but it is what I expected.  I am not an artist nor am I a writer or marketer. I am a programmer and it shows. I come with the same flaws that many of us programmers share including shyness. Though, one thing I do have is confidence in my own work and my ability to create great games that people can enjoy.

My fist error was assuming people would look past my art assets and view my game though the eyes of a programmer but I was wrong (now it seems to obvious). I wanted people to see that the mechanics of my game were smooth and simple. Instead they seemed to get stuck on the horribly ugly images I had on my page and in my game. 

Before day one I had my bucket ready and now I'm trying scoop out the water that's sinking this project.

**Updates:**

1. Added [Promotion Image](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#6) to top of page to clarify platform availability
2. I replaced this terrible custom field sketch with a cleaner version. Now that I look back I don't know what I was thinking to have this as the first image on my page. 
  * Fields - [Ver1](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#2) | [Ver2](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#3)
3. Redesigned rewards and then redesigned again after getting advice from a graphics designer.
  * Rewards - [Ver1](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#7) | [Ver2](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#8) | [Ver3](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#9)
4. Redesigned the headers to make them more readable
  * Headers - [Ver1](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#0) | [Ver2](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#1)
5. Changed my profile image to a picture of myself to make it more personal.
  * Profile Image - [Ver1](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#4) [Ver2](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#5)
6. Placed [listing for artist](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/182x1o/lfartist_to_create_spritesheet_for_top_down/) to design in game sprites. Two promising applicants thus far. 
7. Lastly, I am working on a new video to introduce the rest of the team.

**Paid Advertising Overview:**

Another major decision I have made is to stop all paid advertising and focus on social networking more and more. I wish I had figured this one out years ago but I will go ahead and learn my lesson now. 

For the project I ran three ad campaigns:

[$3/day Facebook Ad](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=600311433957&amp;demo_ad=6005854891648&amp;h=AQAH12s6e5y-yBfU) 

* Targeting male Android users between the ages 13 and 50 who lived in any one of the cities that had an NFL team. 
* URL leads to Facebook photo album. 
* [Activity Graph](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#0)

[$20/day Facebook Ad](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=600311433957&amp;demo_ad=6005944534048&amp;h=AQBpalu0BKGMfwYd) 

* Targeting male mobile phone users between the ages 18 and 50 who lived in the United States. 
* URL leads to Facebook post about Kickstarter launch.
* [Activity Graph](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#1)

[$10/day x 2 StumbleUpon Ad](https://www.stumbleupon.com/content/32nGlW)

* Initially I just had a single Stumble Upon ad set at average priority ($10 for 100 views) then added a second with highest priority ($10 for 40 views from more active users). This lead to 3 likes rather than 0 but still far from effective. 
* [Traffic Overview](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#8)
* [Traffic Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#7)

**Social Advertising Overview:**

A few notes on my experience and what I did to spread the word via Websites, Blogs, and Social Media.

* I created a [press release](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=gmail&amp;attid=0.1&amp;thid=13c86c38468ff8e3&amp;mt=application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document&amp;url=https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui%3D2%26ik%3Da595dcdabe%26view%3Datt%26th%3D13c86c38468ff8e3%26attid%3D0.1%26disp%3Dsafe%26realattid%3Df_hcj5pez20%26zw&amp;sig=AHIEtbTPhoK8VwXb-xdDDLQMkMi7FOOkTQ) and sent it to as many related gaming sites a possible. 
* I sent out requests to my personal Facebook friends, email contacts, and LinkedIn connections. 
* I created a Website, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, and Reddit Account dedicated to my project. 
  * Twitter - 52 followers, Tweets from Others with a combined following of over 300,000.
  * Facebook - 77 Page likes (26 are Personal Friends)
  * Youtube - 1300 Views
  * Reddit - 60 Link Karma, 12 Posts
* I was featured on the [IGDA Kickstarter page](http://www.kickstarter.com/igda)
* After meeting some of the guys at TecmoBowl.org through [a post](http://tecmobowl.org/topic/53094-tecmo-super-bowl-like-mobile-games/) they were kind enough to post my Kickstarter on the [Tecmo Super Bowl Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TecmoSuperBowl?fref=ts) page on Super Bowl Sunday

**Kickstarter Statistics:** 

After all this I would have hoped for a better response but here are our statistics as of today:

* [Project Overview](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#3) - 9% Funded
* [Graph of Progress](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#2) - Flat
* [Total Video Views](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#6) - 1,389
* [Traffic Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#4) - Facebook $160, Stumble Upon $0. (Facebook is more than likely from friends and not ads)
* [Reward Popularity](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#5)

Hopefully with my updates I see a change but if not I will continue scooping water over the side.

If nothing else I hope this post helps others to understand that artistic assets are not to be overlooked. Had I done a better job preparing my Kickstarter initially I believe I would have had a much more positive response. 

Edit: This post is meant to be informational but if you disagree or have criticism please share it. I have shared a lot of personal opinion in this post and may very well be wrong.

Some of you might know me, though I post rarely to anywhere outside of /r/terraria. I'm one of the two developers that produced Terraria and I also run my own indie games company producing what I'd like to think are innovative, high quality games.

At the moment we're working on a hugely ambitious project that's coming along nicely, and we're at a stage where a lot of the groundwork is done and we think bringing in a second programmer would be beneficial. 

I can't reveal too much about the game at this stage, for obvious reasons. But if you're a fan of some of my previous work chances are you will love this project.

In terms of who we're looking for...

- Ideally you'd have very strong C++ skills with a mathematical or graphics background

- You're willing to work under and follow directions from our lead programmer. 

- You're someone who understands how to deliver, that it's the end result that's important.

- Someone good at working in a small team of completely unprofessional, but lovely people. 

- Have time to dedicate at least 20 hours a week to game development

- Are happy to work with an emphasis on communication and planning

If this sounds like you, or even if it doesn't and you feel like sending an application anyway, send me a PM and tell me why you're perfect for the job :) Code samples and completed projects are always great to see, though not essential. 

Location isn't important as we're willing to take people on who are able to work remotely. Though availability during GMT working hours/evenings is important.

**The story behind Futile:**

I come from a background using Flash and Cocos2D, but I've always wanted to use Unity because of the cross platform support (and because C# is great). The problem was that all the Unity 2D frameworks I found had tons of integration in the Unity editor, and lots of crazy features, but I just wanted something simple that could be used 100% from code, like all the platforms I was used to.

So I finally bit the bullet, did a bunch of research, and figured out how to create a framework that worked how I want, and it ended up working really well. It was meant to be just a personal thing, but I casually mentioned it on Twitter and a bunch of people seemed to be interested, so I decided I'd make it a bit more presentable and release it.

It does a lot of neat stuff behind the scenes, like custom dynamic batching and stuff, but the core api is really simple and will be super familiar to Flash and Cocos2D developers. 

Stuff like: 

    FContainer container = new FContainer();
    container.rotation = 90;
    container.x = -50;
    FEngine.stage.AddChild(container);
    
    FSprite banana = new FSprite(""Banana.png"");
    banana.x = 10;
    banana.y = 100;
    banana.scaleX = 1.5f;
    banana.alpha = 0.5f;
    
    container.AddChild(banana);

It's still in development and basically completely undocumented, but hopefully some people find it useful. It's completely open-source under the MIT license, so you can do whatever you want with it :)

I have plenty of experience making music that encapsulates a specific feeling or atmosphere. 

I excel in any mood of electronic, 8-bit, ambient, psychedelic, experimental, and industrial music.

I work in constant communication with the game developers to craft the sounds and feelings that the world of your game deserves. I will not stop changing a song around until the game developers feel it is suitable for implementation.

Samples: I've worked under commission for several indie games.
In 2012-2013 I worked on creating an original soundtrack for Wayward, the online survival roguelike. In constant conversation with the game's developers, I created a sound that embodied the harsh yet exciting environment of survival that the game offered.

You can hear the entire soundtrack here:

[Set 1] http://soundcloud.com/mars-san/sets/wayward-ost/

[The game] http://www.unlok.ca/wayward/



I am extremely versatile in composition skill. Here is an example track for a hypothetical hacking or computer based game. The sound is highly processed and computerized

[Track 1] http://soundcloud.com/mars-san/ghost-in-the-wire-theme
In addition I work on experimental and ambient tracks, implementing sampling and atmospheric layering. Here are two example songs.

[Track 2] http://soundcloud.com/mars-san/2b1mmortal

[Track 3] http://soundcloud.com/mars-san/feudal

I hope these tracks will display an idea of the versatility of sounds I can create. As a composer my job is two fold, not only to eventually write the music for your game, but primarily to understand the mood of your game and translate that into a song.

I'm really trying to get my music out there as much as possible so I am not charging a penny for this service.

We just published a three-part tutorial series on coding a synthesizer-based audio engine for generating sounds at runtime, without the need for external MP3 or WAV files:

1. [Introduction to Waveforms](http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/tutorials/implementation/noise-creating-a-synthesizer-for-retro-sound-effects-introduction/)
2. [Building the Core Engine](http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/tutorials/implementation/noise-creating-a-synthesizer-for-retro-sound-effects-core-engine/)
3. [Adding Support for Audio Processors (and Coding a Delay Processor)](http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/tutorials/implementation/noise-creating-a-synthesizer-for-retro-sound-effects-audio-processors/)

The end result is a working library that you can drop into your games. It's written in AS3, but all the key concepts are explained, so you should be able to follow along with any platform that offers a low-level sound API.

I have a question for those of you who are full-time professional game developers that work for some company in the industry. 

Let's say some person (me) with no professional game development experience is applying for a programming position in your company. Can you name something you'd expect to see in their portfolio of projects that would make you consider giving them a chance to interview? Would you expect to see full games or mods for existing games? Would you expect them to use an engine or write from scratch? Maybe non-games, more like demos showing that the author has mastered some advanced topic? Would you expect to see 3d games or would you be satisfied with 2d games with reasonably complex gameplay, given that the author provides some other proof that he actually understands the math behind 3d games?

P.S.: I'm working on expanding my current set of projects which include some 2d games written in c++ from scratch and I want to figure out what to do next, but I'm intimidated by 3d mainly because it's extremely challenging for me to create models/environments that don't look like complete crap (blender's UI made me curl up in a ball and cry). That is not to say that I don't understand 3d math though,  I have some 3d ""demos"", but those are not games, just bits &amp; bobs that focus on some particular aspect (e.g. lighting, or camera movement, etc.)",,False,,t5_2qi0a,False,,,True,t3_18qkgy,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/18qkgy/what_would_you_expect_to_see_in_a_programmers/,

Only recently have I found [this blog](http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/), which tells me to use UDP, instead of TCP.  After listening to all of the reasons, it made sense, and I could completely understand why he would suggest that.  I began creating code based on what the blog told me I would need, and I believe I have something working (At the very least seems to be working).  Anyway, that's not quite the reason I'm here.  In the blog he mentioned about sending 30 packets per second for the client and 10 per second for the server.  Because of this, I have a few questions, and maybe a few wrong ideas:  

1) What I was wondering was what type of information should be in these packets.  It seems that I shouldn't have more than 1 type of information in the same packet.  For example, I should have separate packets for movement and attacking.  

2)If the game is running at 60 ticks per second,  I obviously can't send movement packets every tick, as that would surpass the 30 packets per second, and I can't do half that either if I'm not putting multiple information in them.  So instead, should I do something where key presses are sent, and the server interprets them and move the character?  

3) Another issue I've run into with other things that I've made which had multiplayer was how to make the server authoritative, while keeping the client smooth and not lagging too much.  What I usually run into is where the server tells the player that they are too far forward and they, more or less, get moved around to where they previously were.

Any help or articles on these issues would be much appreciated.

[EDIT]  Thanks for all the help everyone, this blew up quite big.  I will most likely have questions for everyone, just try to bear with me. I would also like to note for the people who are recommending this and that in the way of code, that I'm using Java (I'm very sorry I forgot to mention this sooner).

After a while of my game being up on indievania I have come to realise that the most disappointing thing about the lack of sales wasn't the lack of money but the lack of people playing it. That's why I want to make the game available to everyone and I want to have as many people as possible to be able to play it.

A little back story on Glare: It was made for XBLIG and while selling a respectable amount, it never hit the threshold for paying out money to me. I turned to PC stores but as it turns out, it's a rough market and I was doing it for the wrong reason. All I want to do is make games and get better at it and I can't get better at it if I don't know how my games are perceived.

Glare is an expansion of my university project to dynamically change the difficulty of the game based on the users current skill level. So while it may just look like a geometry wars clone, there is some major differences running behind it. 

So I submit this to reddit hoping that a few of you may play the game and help me on my quest to make better games! :)",,False,,t5_2qi0a,False,,,True,t3_16z2jn,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/16z2jn/my_indie_game_glare_is_now_free/,

We just update our little Unity3D plugin, and since I don't think many people know about it, I thought about sharing the news to fellow Unity3D devs!

Texture Tools is a plugin that enables you to tweak some aspects of your textures inside Unity. All filters/tasks run in a separate thread, so they don't stop you from working on your game scenes.

**Features:**

[SWF2PNG AIR App](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Cats0/catsplugins/unity/texturetools/promo300x300/promo_swf2png.png) - Your MovieClip animations to png sequences without having to deal with messy registration points manually.

[Solidify](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Cats0/catsplugins/unity/texturetools/promo300x300/promo_solidify.png) - Removes white halos from transparent textures. Solidify fixes the fully transparent pixels of your textures so they can be displayed properly when they are sampled by the engine.

[Resize](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Cats0/catsplugins/unity/texturetools/promo300x300/promo_resize.png) - Lanczos (great for reduction), HQ2X, HQ4X and HQ4X Smooth (great for enlarging pixel-art textures).

[Filters](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Cats0/catsplugins/unity/texturetools/promo300x300/promo_filters.png)
Photo Filters - InstaRetro, Sepia and Warm70s.
HSL - Hue, Saturation and Lightness/Luminance. This can be useful if you're building for mobile and can't afford a custom shader due its performance cost.

[Unpack/cut sprite atlases](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Cats0/catsplugins/unity/texturetools/promo300x300/promo_cut.png) - A fast way to use sprite-sheets from Tiled to your favorite 2d sprite plugin.

[Batch Processing](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Cats0/catsplugins/unity/texturetools/promo300x300/promo_batch.png) - All texture modifiers can do multiple textures at once.

All filters can be run in-game! [Here's an example.](http://www.catsinthesky.com/plugins/examples/texturetools_runtime) This is useful for editing avatars pictures inside your game.

* Remember: This subreddit is about game development, not games in general or development in general!
* If your post doesn't show up in [/new/](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/new/), Reddit probably blocked it! Do not be afraid to [Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgamedev) if it happens to you!

And so it's not all just negatives:

* Sidebar: Post stuff related to topics on game development: programming, math art, physics, sound, engines, music, marketing, business. Questions, discussions and advice.

* Write about your own projects, particularly if you have useful insights or lessons to share.

* Make sure that your questions are properly researched; if the question has already been asked in the past, link to previous discussions, show us your code, explain your problem, the steps you've taken, the things you've found that led you to decide that you had to ask a question, etc.

* If you want to self-promote, you have to ""earn"" it -- that means if you want to drop your website, twitter, kickstarter, greenlight, etc., you have to give the community something. That could be an article that you wrote on your website. It could be an experience report, a story, an explanation of how you tackled a specific problem, a look inside your development process. Just contribute something gamedev-related that is interesting, insightful, innovative, or awesome, in your opinion, and we will overlook the fact that you are promoting your game or crowdfunding campaign.

* You can and should post about any compos or contests that might be going on. If you're a compo organizer, even better; don't be afraid to post multiple reminders (within reason). Just make sure to remain available to answer questions in the thread. But please, to show off your compo games, use Feedback Friday or Screenshot Saturday. For contests, post about it once, and include the rules in the post.

* This is a nice place for a game developer AMA, if you can sustain people's attention. Make sure to introduce your technology and to show any past articles or blog entries about it. Screenshots and videos are nice too. Post lots of relevant material, tell us stories about your group's dramatic break up, how your drunk aunt kicked you out of her attic, etc. 

* If you are a game related service website, such as a website that helps game developers market themselves, an owner of a new gamedev community website, an in-game ad service, etc... You get one introductory post for your service or website. After that, you can pay for reddit advertising and your spam can go in the little box with the other paid spam.

* If you are posting a link to a repository for an open source project such as an engine or library, make sure to provide ample context. /r/gamedevclassifieds is really the best subreddit for recruiting collaborators. We redirect people there because they have great, specific job posting rules, and we genuinely feel your interests would be better served there.

* You get one free spam ticket a month by subscribing to /r/gamedev. With this ticket, you are allowed to spam your game in /r/Games, /r/IndieGaming, and /r/gaming once a month.

I have a lot of ideas and a couple of working prototypes but no one will play black rectangles vs red circles on white background battles. I also find it very hard to work without any graphics because I'm discouraged by the idea that no matter how much work I put into it, it will never look good and therefore people will not play it.

In general - where do you find your artists? And how do you work? Do you pay them for assets, or team up and share revenue? If you pay, how much does it cost?

Took me since Monday to make it.  I'm surprised and proud of myself for making it so quickly.  It only has one level at the moment, but I could easily make more levels.  This is the first game that I can actually say I've finished it.  Work can still be done on it of course, but it's a solid build as it is now.  I'll try to provide some links to play it yourself once I get off work.

When the player jumps and hits its head on a roof, it sticks there.  Originally I thought of it as a bug, but I thought, ""fuck it, it's a feature now"" lmao.  Weird how a game can develop out of bugs

a little less than 2 years ago i wrote a book called ""Beginning Android Games"". The book become somewhat of [a success](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Android-Games-Mario-Zechner/dp/1430230428/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top) in its field, making me a proud little author.

A few months later something bad happened, my publisher was being [a bit of a dick](http://www.badlogicgames.com/wordpress/?p=2255). I felt horrible, seeing how people called the book out for being what it is, a shameless attempt to milk things by putting a missleading ""4"" into the title.

I was approached by Apress again this year. They asked me to update the book, a real 2nd edition. Even though i wasn't happy with Apress, i said fuck it, and agreed to do this revision.  I put 6 months of my life into the first edition, it's a love child and something i will look back on as one of my life achievements. I couldn't just give it up. So i put another 6 months into this 2nd edition, updating outdated information, fixing errors in the code of the ""Beginning Android 4 Games"" ""edition"" (how the hell could they fuck that up? First edition was prestine), adding new things.

An here i am with a [brand new edition](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Android-Games-Mario-Zechner/dp/1430246774/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354918984&amp;sr=1-2-fkmr0&amp;keywords=beginning+android+games+sec). I put a lot of blood and sweat into this one, and i think it is the perfect companion for a beginning (Android) game developer. You can read the detailed [table of contents](http://badlogicgames.com/downloads/toc.pdf), and you can checkout all the [source code from Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/beginnginandroidgames2/). The book assumes no previous game development knowledge, programming experience, preferably with Java is required though. You'll develop 3 games, two 2D games, one 3D game, and you'll get to know all Android APIs relevant to game development.

If you own a previous version, read the TOC and compare it to your version's TOC. I let you decide if a purchase is worth it (probably not). There are two new chapters, one covering the NDK and accessing C/C++ code via JNI, and the other one is on marketing and monetization. The NDK chapter is very lightweight, it's a beginner's book after all. However, it demonstrates a real use case, and should teach you all you need to move performance critical stuff to native code.

The income generated from the book goes mostly to [libgdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) and its nasty set of build servers. The best way to support libgdx is by taking part in its community or even participating in its development. The second best way is to buy a copy of the book. You get something for your money. Dontations make me feel like a beggar.

In any case, i'm really happy that this second marathon is over and the book is out there. I guess it could be a nice gift for a friend or relative for christmas :)

It's my cake day today, so i just pretend that this is totally not spam (actually, you get all the code for free, and there's libgdx as well :D)",,False,,t5_2qi0a,False,,,True,t3_14gvge,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/14gvge/my_book_beginning_android_games_2nd_edition_is/,

[Hook Champ](http://www.rocketcat-games.com/hook/) from Rocketcat Games was released for iOS in late 2009\. So many levels, so little time. That's when I was pulled into the darkness. ""Just one more retry, man. I promise I'll quit after this,"" I'd say as my eyes began to twitch uncontrollably.

I'd finish with the fastest time on a level and become champion of the entire universe. ""I am the greatest gamer in the history of the world!"" I'd scream from my cave at two in the morning. Stray cats just stared at me through the window, but they knew who was boss. The next day... disaster.

Who the eff is **mikeg123**? And why is his name higher on the leaderboard? I began the five stages of grief. *Denial:* He's probably a hacker. *Anger:* That stupid hacker! *Bargaining:* That makes me number one by default, right? *Depression:* I'll never get a high score ever again. *Acceptance:* You're right, stray cats. I shouldn't give up!

After weeping uncontrollably for an hour, I regained my confidence and took back the [top spot](http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?p=760099#post760099). My precious. The battle went back and forth like this for weeks. At some point there was even a [sports training montage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SUzcDUERLo).

We were both invited to beta test the next app from Rocketcat Games. Throughout 2010, mikeg123 and I communicated via email. We talked a lot of trash and competed with each other in multiple games. Then discussion turned to the idea of creating a speed running game of our own.

I had some moderate art skills and he had decent programming experience. That's obviously the perfect equation to create a video game. In 2011, **BeaverTap Games** was born. After over a year and a half of development in our spare time, our game **Mikey Shorts**, a 2D platformer for iOS, is finally available on the App Store.

We hope everybody has a lot of fun with this one!

**TL:DR;** Two handsome dudes battled for high scores in a game and then decided to make their own game!

There are so many channels, and ways to do it, that really getting a general idea of the indie environment economically is difficult.

As such I wanted to try, an anecdote based information gathering experiment. 

I thought people could share in detail, anonymously how they supported themselves through indie gamedev the past year *explicitly*. 

So create a throwaway account, and post below. I'd really like to see the success stories and the struggles as well, I think it could be a valuable exercise for everyone here.

So the questionnaire.
 
Without mentioning the games of course.

* How many finished saleable projects did you ship over the last 12 months?

* What platforms did you target and ship those games to? 

* How were sales? How much did you end up grossing off that? 

* Was that enough to continue working as an independent for the next year?

* If not, what other work contract or not did you have to take to get by? 

* Any thoughts you want to release on the feelings side would be fine too.

Thanks!

For those who know of us, we've been working hard on our site, [Develteam](http://develteam.com) over the past few months, and we're coming close to the end of our Beta era. A lot of the kinks have been worked out.


For those who do not know of us, [Develteam](http://develteam.com) is a community for game developers with systems built in to facilitate collaboration. We make it easy to find, judge, and work with other developers.

We have three main areas of focus for the site: **Connect**, **Communicate**, and **Collaborate**.


* **CONNECT**

We have systems in place to **browse developers by their skillset**, filtering your options to view only artists, programmers, musicians, sound engineers, writers, or designers.

Part of what helps us connect developers is the ability to **upload your portfolio** pieces to show your work. You can upload images, videos, youtube clips, audio samples, and other multimedia formats. This helps connect developers, because frankly, who wants to bring someone into their project without knowing what they're capable of? Right now, it isn't uncommon to browse Classifieds forums like those found on tigsource, gamedev.net, and  /r/gamedevclassifieds. While these are valid avenues, anyone who has tried to go this route knows that it isn't easy to research all the candidates or find quality people. At Develteam, it's very easy.


* **COMMUNICATE**

The site itself has some great features. We have a site-wide **Forums**, a **General Chatroom** that anyone can access, **Private 1-on-1 Chat**, social network style **Feeds and Walls**, a growing **list of Game Dev Tools and websites with Assets**, a **Private Mail system**, **Notifications**, and more. 

Whether you're showing off your personal work, or want to promote a Game you're working on or finished, Develteam makes it easy to give and receive feedback.

* **COLLABORATE**

Once your team has been assembled, you can **create Game Projects** right there on the site. Your game project will be listed in the browse pages. You can set a flag in the options to declare that you're actively looking for new members to join and what roles you wish to fill. This allows Developers to browse only game projects that are looking for members of a specific discipline. If an artist wants to join a Game Project, he/she can browse an easy to find list of projects that are looking for artists. It couldn't be easier!

**Game projects have a variety of tools** at their disposal, including a **Private File Depot**, a **Public Media Library** for showing game assets and so on, **Public and Private Forums**, a **Member Task System** to keep track of what has been and what needs to be done, and a **Private Web-Based Chatroom**. 

**Each Chatroom has features that make collaboration easy**: A White Board, Video/Audio conferencing (Webcam and Mic), Real-Time Document Sharing/Editing, and Screen Sharing... All from the browser. 


----
* **THE FUTURE**

As I mentioned, we're still in Beta, only a few months old. The existing community has been very helpful in suggesting features that help with connecting and collaborating. 

We have some ideas that we're still working on. One is a ""Brainstorming"" system. Our thought is that one user can start a topic, like ""A game where you use unique biological properties of underwater idea life."" At that point, any one can jump in and out of the conversation, throwing in ideas. Sort of a Stack Overflow for creative types.

We'd like to see you drop by and we look forward to seeing your portfolio.

tldr: What skills qualify someone to be more than just ""another ideas guy""?

See posts quite often in /r/GameDevClassifieds where someone just has an idea, and that's it. And the response is (quite rightly) ""But what do YOU bring to the table?""

I get it to the generic ideas guys who have a one sentence synopsis usually about some hugely unrealistic sized game they want to make, but what about the guys who have done proper GDDs and designing down to the detail, for something that's plausible and possible.

Not including programming and art. Is there anything that someone can bring to the table that people would want to collaborate with? 

Is there a satisfactory answer to that question? 

Or is it rhetorical and stating:
Don't Program? Don't Draw? Don't bother!

I'm very curious about this as someone who wants to get involved in game design and development, I intend to grow my skills where I can so people will actually want to work with me and I wont get that response :P But does any other skill carry weight, or is it just programming and art that has clout when it comes to indie teams.

It's even sadder to see people shaking their heads, or telling young aspiring developers to learn C++ if they want to make games properly for a living.

While learning to program is great (though you'll never make me admit C++ is great, water torture or otherwise) it's worth bearing in mind that great things can be done with any tool, and that **the primary deciding factor in whether you are good at something like game development is how much time or effort you are willing to give over to it**. 

Tomorrow, *Hotline Miami* is released worldwide, which is incredibly exciting news. It's doubly exciting because the game was made in Game Maker. I was blown away when I was told this - the slickness of the controls, the interesting video effects, they're all done using this great and incredibly flexible tool.

http://hotlinemiami.com/

Please don't forget that the technology you use is not what makes your games good. Start practicing now! Here's a good site with an inspirational video and links to lots of great stuff, including Game Maker, Construct and other tools like it: http://www.youcanmakevideogames.com

There are lots of other great games made in tools like these (including my personal love, Spelunky). And most of them are free/have free versions, so there's no excuse!

EDIT - Many people pointing out that GM does not train you to be a programmer. This is true. What it does do, though, is introduce the concept of programming, allow people to become interested and inspired in development, and give others an option to learn how to design fun, small-scale games without focusing on the busywork and bullshit associated with a lot of game coding.

Getting good at game development, like getting good at anything, requires lots of time and effort. GM is a good tool because it eases people in, lowers initial expectations and allows them to get started right away with something that can, given time, produce something exceptional. Telling people that MMOs are written in C++ so they should start writing their network code right away otherwise it's wasted time: that's not helping anyone.

I also think we should be more aware of the ""I self-taught so you can too"" and the ""I am a programmer, and I find it easy, so you will too"" paradoxes that crop up on here from time to time. People are difference, and you have forgotten how impenetrable programming is.

In late 2009 we started producing a boardgame-inspired MMO where players control a viking family up through the viking age. We were 5 people working on it, with occasional support from students and a few extras. Budget was less than 450.000 euros (594.000 USD) and the aim of the game is to tell the history of the vikings in an entertaining way, while staying true to history and mythos.

The game has a casual learning element and is produced by DR - the danish national public service broadcaster - and when all is ready, it will target a danish, swedish and norwegian audience. A casual learning massively multiplayer online boardgame.

It is in a final beta stage and this (this text you are reading) is the first public announcement of the game. r/games deserves to get first peek!

Here are some videos and I hope you don't mind the speak, as it is made by an amateur (me) just to get it on reddit and hear your opinion :) It might not be great, but hopefully intelligible:

[SAGA - behind the screens](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4AazVzSfOM&amp;hd=1)

These videos are in english, but I am afraid the game is not. The game is in 3 different scandinavian languages, but could easily be translated, if some broadcaster wants to give its audience a viking age experience.

I would love to hear what you think of the games interface and whatever else you get a peek at in the videos. I know you have some great, harsh critique and I would greatly appreciate anything in words, since downvotes or upvotes don't really make me any wiser :)

[Here is a text with more details](http://downol.dr.dk/download/saga/Saga_short_presentation_ENG.pdf), if you are *really* interested - it's a bit of a sales pitch, so read it with some scepticism ;)

I am the game director and game designer (Lars Vilhelmsen) and the game can be found at www.dr.dk/saga or at www.sagaonline.dk, www.sagaonline.se and www.sagaonline.no if you can managed to play a game in the language of DK, NO or SE.

Ask questions below and I will try to answer (greenwich +1 time zone here).

Some friends want to build a game, and I like their idea. However, my experience with coding in C++ has been that it's always a remarkably bad time. As a result, I've basically avoided it wherever I could.

We're currently still in the planning stages, but some of the other guys are pushing that C++ is the only way to go for anything game related.

The two languages I've enjoyed coding in the most have been C# and Java, and I prefer C#. I'm not only asking about Java and C#, but basically I want to try to find either a more pleasant option to work with than C++, or a way to make C++ more pleasant to work with.

So:

1. Is anything else really viable for cross-platform game development?
--- I looked at Vala a little bit - it compiles down to C which sounds promising. Have any of you guys worked with it?
--- Any other suggestions?

2. Is there anything I can do to make C++ as developer-friendly as C#? Perhaps a good object-oriented framework (maybe with garbage collection) that you can suggest starting from, and a decent IDE with Intellisense and a passive syntax checker, and the ability to run it and step through the program, and perhaps something to generate the makefiles and whatnot automatically? Perhaps something that does some of the above?

If you could give two tips to a budding indie game developer who hasn't even completed one game, what would those two tips be?

***************************

 **Tips Given** (comment pull, summarized):

 * Simple simple simple. Have a background in simple games prior to starting any major product
 * Finish your game, don't abandon it. (Granted that you're beyond the ""simple simple simple"" stage)
 * Don't be afraid to make a copy of game like Pacman, Tetris, etc: They are great intros into developing
 * Get experience from real jobs in programming
 * Great idea's can lead to unattainable desires, turning joy to frustration and then depression
 * Re-work old projects for experience purposes, like converting your Javascript game to C++
 * When learning a new engine, even experienced developers re-create simple games (pong, breakout, etc) to learn the engine faster
 * Keep a blog of your work, jotting down spent hours and money (example: http://iwannadevelopgames.com )
 * Break your game into small pieces, then combine like a puzzle later on
 * Finish/polish your game before letting the feature-creep set in ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep )
 * Only show initial prototypes to people who know what it takes to design/code things themselves (http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/18w3ea/tips_on_first_game/c8ijukk)
 * There is always a chance for ""Version 2.0"" of your game. A game that is notoriously bad could become stupendously awesome in v2.0
 * People are awesome. People are dicks. Learn to live with both of them.
 * Feedback Fridays on /r/gamedev. ""People are awesome/dicks"" rule applies, but feedback is essential
 * Remember your sibling saving over your Save Game in &lt;var String gameName = ""Favorite Game Here""&gt;, and from then on you used ALL the save file slots? Make iterative copies of your source as you go on your merry way. Backtracking a week is better then backtracking the whole thing.
 * Start small and simple, and with experience you will be able to know when starting bigger is the better option
 * Set your features/requirements for the game early on, and don't deviate from them unless they become obsolete. Only add on new features/requirements when your product is nearly completed or completely polished. We have sequels for a reason.
 * There are no shortcuts to success (well, mostly). In the case of learning programming and learning the engine you are using, shortcuts will only hinder you in the long run.

***************************

 **Good Games to Code First (Generally in order)**:

 * Pong
 * Breakout
 * Tetris
 * Pac-Man
 * 2D Side-Scroller, Mario/Mega-Man style

1357475905.0,126,self.gamedev,1624gh,Axis the new open source html5 game engine,154,28,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1624gh/axis_the_new_open_source_html5_game_engine/,"After seeing the recent JavaScript game engine thread I remembered, oh yeah I have an engine too! I haven't worked on it in a while so if people like this I may start working on it more. So here you go guys, nearly three years of my life. **Axis!** Last time I checked, months ago, this was one of the most advanced JavaScript canvas2d engines available. 

Here's a small feature list pasted from my site.

* Sprites with time based animation
* Nice camera with customizable delay and follow actor features
* Infinite layers and switching between them
* Polygon based path system
* Sphere, square, and polygon based collisions
* Custom and simple event system
* 150+ key combinations, mouse, touch input
* Basic behavior tree AI
* Scene Management
* Dialogue tree system with 670+ customization possibilities
* Resource manager, very powerful
* Html5 audio and video manager
* In game skewed or shrunk video
* Timers with chained commands
* Works on known platforms and browsers and phones(as far as I know)
* Cached and word wrapped text

My methodology when making this was to make it light and keep it out of the way. I don't want to force too many of my ideas of programming on you so I made the engine more like a series of libraries you can use as you like. 

Some of the features like the resource manager I'm very proud of, I believe it can be used separate from the engine so you can just take that and use it with your own project. It's simple, you can load resources (sprites,images,sounds,video) into sections and pick which sections to load when you want, it'll return the ratio of loaded vs all. You can also unload sections, though whether or not the browser will free the memory depends on the browser.

Another nice feature is the ability to make individual paths for each actor with polygons. Turning on debug will draw the paths. 

Now, it's not finished, some things still need to be cleaned, debugged, and remade. Like the level system, it's a complete mess and it only supports background and foreground images. Also I'm 100% self taught so some things I do I may do weird because I figured it out myself. In my roadmap to 0.5 I have to remake levels and do tiled maps too. The Behavior tree is simple and doesn't have any premade behaviors, the collisions are simple too and leave what to do up to you while giving all info you'll need. It's not too limiting as you'll see in the Tech Demo I'll post.

The current roadmap to 0.5 includes the level remaking, reworking the engine to a more OO style, and finish converting all code to coffeescript. Oh yeah about a quarter of it is made with coffeescript.

It's pretty fast and powerful, the tech demo I'll post has literally hundreds of resources like animations and sounds. If you want to see a stress test, here's a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/3NS3f.jpg) of a bug that happened while making apalia where at least 50+ enemies spawned and chased me around all with their own collision and AI running. The engine was chugging along like nothing was weird.

Here's the repository [(repo)](https://bitbucket.org/g1i1ch/axis). About the resources folder, not all my stuff in there. Just used for testing.

I apologize for the weak use of comments, I was the only one working on this ever and I've never had too much need for them personally.

Here's the tech demo, made together with another studio. You can look at the code **but none of the art or music is mine!**. &lt;You'll probably need a pretty beefy system because of all the hundreds of animations and shit it has, plus it's drawn in 1080i! Also it will take some time to load since it's pretty big. Lastly, there may be some messy code here to there since was on deadline! Actually works best on IE10, weird right?!&gt;

[Apalia Tech Demo](http://iris-studios.co/demo/). LMB to move, attack, action. MMB to heal and block.

For those with too slow computers, here's a really quick vid of an early version on my website. http://iris-studios.co/?p=107

I have some part way finished documentation on my site, http://iris-studios.co/?incsub_wiki=axis-engine. The only namespaces documented some so far are ""ax"" the main namespace and ""axt"" the dialog tree namespace. 

I have a small polygon path editor for those interested in using the engine, I realized pretty quickly that editing polygons by hand is a bitch. http://iris-studios.co/ally/. 

Info on the polygon editor: 
Drag your background onto the ""Back"" box to set the background, drag your foreground image onto the ""Over"" box to set your foreground. Drag the nodes around with LMB, delete nodes with MMB, and create new nodes with RMB. The little black dot denotes the head of the polygon, new nodes will be connected to it. Hit ""Enter"" for it to open a small window with a semi formatted array for you. This is just a little basic utility I made for myself, it's made with the engine itself. Make sure to use images bigger than the screen for now, there's a bug in the level code (needs to be remade remember).

If anyone would like to help me out making this open source let me know. I've only coded with myself before and haven't run a community. Oh yeah, it's licensed LGPL since that's better for our kind.

Enjoy

[update]
Well seems there's a little interest. So I've made /r/AxisEngine for anyone who needs support, wants instruction on using the engine, or just to talk about it. I'll probably start moving the documentation to the wiki on there soon. I'll be gone most of today, but I should be available again tomorrow.

I have been thinking about quitting my day job for a few months. I had just released my first game, and even though it didn't do very well financially (I plan on posting about that in the next few days), it was an amazing feeling to have a game released.

I have enough saved up to easily live a year or a year and a half with no income so I can really get the ball rolling. If, my games flop through that, then I will hunt for a new job with a lot of new experiences on my resume.

I plan on doing some smaller games that are more mainstream than my first game to try to get some initial money flowing. I guess I am not really looking for advice on whether I should quit but I am more curious on how it went for other people that may have been in some similar situation.

I wouldn't have had the confidence to continue pushing myself without the inspiration and aid from other developers like yourself, so thanks for being awesome guys.

What makes game music memorable? Is it the genre, the instruments used, the moment it appears in the game? Although each of these aspects may enhance the memorability of a song, the most important aspect is melody. Every single game that was featured on The Musical Box, and probably your favorite game soundtrack as well, has strong melodies. But, what the heck is a melody?

The Set-Up

A melody is a succession of notes that are highlighted in a composition. They stand out in the context of the whole song, even though they are still related to all other musical elements, such as harmony, rhythm and even production values. The melody is the hummable part of the music and some composers consider it the most important element of a composition.

A well-crafted melody is instantly recognized by the human brain. If done correctly, it can also become an integral part of gameplay. There's a huge difference between music that takes advantage of strong melodies and music that doesn't. Melody-driven music does not stay in the background; it pops out just like vibrant colors. Obviously, nobody wants the music to stand out all the time, and this is when the composer must use his sensibility to use melodies with wisdom.

Balance is the key

Overusing melody may indeed be a problem, especially due to the repetitive nature of videogame music, but the other side of the spectrum is also not recommended. Using solely background music with little or no melodies at all neglects the immense power that melodies may have on peoples' minds. In a competitive industry like ours, every developer is trying to conquer mindshare, and music with strong melodies is an incredibly powerful tool to achieve that.

Finding a good balance between songs with strong melodies and songs that blend with the background may be the solution, depending on the genre of the game.

The moments

See below for some examples of music that have strong, memorable melodies.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=GJNEmet17Ak#at=195


The impact

If music has an impact in your life, then you should give 90% of the merit to the melodies. When crafted with wisdom, melodies may captivate your target audience brain for years to come. Just look at the numerous versions of ""Overworld"" from Super Mario Bros. that you can find on YouTube. Obviously, there are other factors that may be considered when we talk about Super Mario Bros., such as historical relevance and pioneering, but you may rest assured that the melody played a huge role in the popularity of the franchise. Well-crafted melodies are much better than viral marketing, they are mental viruses that last for generations.",,False,,t5_2qi0a,False,,,True,t3_1hkb88,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1hkb88/great_melodic_music_is_a_powerful_way_to_promote/,

(TL;DR: Publicity is the hardest part of game development, so here are a bunch of things we've tried!)",158,33,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/rgf7j/some_of_the_things_we_learned_from_our_soon_to/,"Hi r/gamedev! Long post incoming:

I'm one of the devs at [Cipher Prime](http://www.cipherprime.com), a four person studio in Philadelphia. We've been around for four years, and we've released a handful of games commercially (including [Auditorium](http://store.steampowered.com/app/205870/) ([web demo here](http://playauditorium.com)), [Fractal](http://store.steampowered.com/app/61310/), and [Pulse](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pulse-volume-one/id432667443?mt=8)).

We're finishing up a month long [Kickstarter for the multiplayer sequel to Auditorium, called Auditorium Duet](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/761471459/auditorium-2-duet/). We're at $51k of $60k, it ends Friday at midnight, and success or failure is still up in the air. I wanted to share some of the things we've learned from the experience thus far. Maybe it will give those of you at companies in a similar position (i.e. the game developers who aren't part-time hobbyists but also aren't Tim Schafer :) ) some ideas, and please feel free to contribute in comments!

The main message: **Publicity is the hardest part of game development.** Not a novel idea, but the Kickstarter really hammered it home. Whether it succeeds or fails, it's given us plenty of invaluable practice. The Kickstarter hasn't been easy ([see our progress to date](http://i.imgur.com/VEbq5.png)), and we think our main issue is simply not getting enough eyes on the project. UPDATE: [progress to date + five hours](http://i.imgur.com/oendt.png). UPDATE 2: [Funded!](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/761471459/auditorium-2-duet) :) + [Kickstarter backend data if you're into that sort of thing](http://imgur.com/a/T4XeO).

Some of the things we've tried/wished we'd tried/learned:

* **Big game press is damned hard to get.** The largest outlet we were able to get was [Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com/tag/auditorium-duet/), which featured our story for a week. Otherwise, cold calling, submitting news, and trying to get in contact with editors/writers was pretty much a bust. We did get a few news articles or mentions on several more well-trafficked sites, like Destructoid and Gamasutra. This is primarily about networking. If you aren't doing any, start meeting people.
* **Little game press is easy to get.** We gave Steam keys out to anyone who wanted to review the original Auditorium's rerelease, and we did a bunch of interviews with basically anyone who asked. It was a big time commitment, for probably a minimal amount of eyes, but we thought it was still important to build relationships with budding game writers/sites, and it still gets our company's name out there for search engines. You meet a bunch of cool people.
* **Aggressive comment follow-up.** if someone writes a story about us, we went a little out of our way to answer people's questions or clear up misconceptions about our company/Kickstarter. There are limits to this, of course, as this sort of stuff can suck up all of your dev time, and not all comments have good answers.
* **In-house mailing list.** We have a roughly 24k person mailing list, which we hit once at the beginning of the Kickstarter, once at the midway point, once at the beginning of this last week, and we're planning on one more tomorrow. This helps, as the people on it are usually interested in your work in the first place. If you don't have a mailing list for your company, start one. Just don't abuse it.
* **Local name brand has helped us out a bunch.** Philly's game dev scene is really small,  so we can be called a ""Philly game studio"" and have it mean something. If you're in a location where a place can ""own"" you, definitely take advantage of it. Local tech sites feature us a bunch, and even smaller news outlets are way more willing to talk and write about you. We also participate actively in our local IGDA chapter and such, and were one of the sponsors for the Global Game Jam here in Philly. The friends you make help you out big time.
* **Cross-Game promotion.** Before the Kickstarter went off, we updated our two iPad games to display a little flag in the menus that links directly to the Kickstarter. They will disappear after the Kickstarter. We also timed the launch of the Kickstarter to coincide with the rerelease of our first game on Steam. The Steam description promotes the Kickstarter as well.
* **Regular website promotion.** Our two highest trafficked sites are cipherprime.com and playauditorium.com, they both have very prominent Kickstarter banners.
* **""Lateral publicity"".** We love love love Starcraft 2, and we've started an at least [monthly online tournament where you compete for pizza](http://www.reddit.com/r/pizzacraft) (we call it Pizzacraft). We held the first one last Saturday. We kept it small because it was an experiment, but we wish we'd started it months ago because we're just getting started and we think it has big potential for getting our name out there.
* **Missed lateral publicity.** We really should have more educational stuff out in the aether. We participate in monthly Unity technical meetups in Philly, and occasionally give talks at local educational institutions about design or music in game development. We have a lot of in-house knowledge that we could potentially share. These are the sort of things we should be putting on Youtube and providing to the community at large.
* **Game Giveaways.** This was something that is potentially very useful, but we're a small team with different opinions about the business consequences of giving away large amounts of product, and for the sake of team harmony we decided not to do a big game giveaway.
* **Other giveaways**. We have two beta keys for Diablo III from GDC, but aren't sure how to leverage them into even a little bit of publicity for our Kickstarter in these last few days. Any ideas?
* **Social media.** We have really lopsided social media use. Twitter we're great at ([follow us!](http://www.twitter.com/cipherprime)), but we never really contribute to game dev forums or Reddit (I'm the only redditor of the four of us, for instance). We'd like to improve on that, because we think that's a huge piece missing from the formula. If you don't use social media because it's tedious and irrelevant to making games, that's fine and partly true. But it's a different story when you're trying to sell games.
* **Your fans are the most wonderful people on earth.** You can't please everyone, and not everyone will like your games. But there are people who love your games more than anything and they go out of your way to support you. We are so incredibly grateful to these people and are willing to go out of our way to make sure we deserve that support.

Finally, a crowd-funding project like Kickstarter is a serious time commitment. It is inherently risky because it's definitely cut into our development time, and nothing might come of it. But you still learn a lot about your marketing reach and abilities.

But in any case, because we've been lurking the Kickstarter website so much in this past month, we've become so incredibly enamored with the idea of it. There is so much cool stuff out there that is just waiting to be made! Even if this first Kickstarter fails, we'll definitely be doing smaller ones for future games and side projects. We've made the Kicking It Forward pledge, and whatever happens, we plan on using company funds to contribute to at least two projects a month.

Anyway, hope some of this helps people out there, if you have any questions feel free to ask!

""Most people say they want to be game designers, but what they really want is to have someone else make their game idea. Everyone has tons of game ideas already.""

But the first time I read this, I was in a bit of a deer-in-the-headlights trance. Because I don't have tons of ideas. I've never dedicated conscious thought to coming up with my own game ideas.

I love games. I love playing them. I love talking about them. I love reading about them. And since I've started dedicating real amounts of time to getting into game development, I've begun to love studying and analyzing games. So the problem isn't that I'm just not ""gamer"" enough.

I've just begun learning to program, but it feels like a natural fit (since my first computer, I've known I'd be working in some tech related field), and while a bigger hurdle for me, I'm even learning to enjoy the art.

I'm told I write well. Given the right prompt I can type away for hours. And I was once a musician, so the music and sound at least make sense, though the subject usually bores me.

The point is that I'm convinced that game development is my future career. The only problem is that I don't have good ideas!  The few things I do dream up that actually interest me usually turn out to be unoriginal or unfun on later examination.

So what's up? If everyone already has tons of ideas, why don't I? Is it just a matter of confidence? How are you inspired? This lack of creativity can't mean I've already failed in game development, right?


**tl;dr**: People say everyone has tons of game ideas, but I don't. How do I get them, or does it mean I'm a lost cause?

**Morning Edit**: Holy responses, Batman! A lot of really great ideas. The gist of it seems to be

1. Pick things from other games you liked or didn't like, and use and/or change them. It's true I do often think ""This would be better if X,"" but I've never considered them my own idea. But I can see where people are coming from. It just takes the right touch to make it your own.

2. Team up with someone more creative. Or as one person put it, every Jobs needs a Woz (somewhat scary, Woz didn't get the best end of the deal there). It makes sense, and I'm sure it'll be the game plan in the future.

3. Immerse yourself in other art. This one I knew about, and I try to do when I get the opportunity. But I'm sensing I need to get out there more often and seek it out, rather than being passive about it.

4. Draw from personal experiences and conversations. This is usually where the few ideas I have come from, now that I think about it. I think I'm going to start carrying around a notepad...

Anyway, this has all been really helpful and encouraging. You guys are awesome! I've seen the posts about people getting a ton of great advice then never returning, but I promise you I won't be like that.

Recently I wrote a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/183e50/going_down_with_this_ship_my_kickstarter/) about my [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/108259147/game-of-inches) project, Game of Inches. I talked about my toughest challenges being art and marketing. The feedback I received was tremendously helpful and has better armed me in moving forward.

That same day, I posted [this request](http://redd.it/182x1o) in /r/gameDevClassifieds. I was fairly nervous about doing business with an artist and expected finding the right person to be a lengthy process. That night, when I got home, I had five responses from artists interested in contributing to Game of Inches. After talking to a few and narrowing down the choice I Skyped with an artist named Keith. 

He not only shared my love for games but also a liking in football and previous Kickstarter experience. After settling on details Keith got to work on concept art for our logo and in game sprite animations.

After just a few days here is what he has been able to help us with:

I was talking to one of my friends today who said that Reddit would be a good place for your music to be used in a game, not knowing what I needed to say just that I have to make sure my grammar is immaculate, I have created this post. 

Quick background on myself: 

- I am a student studying music technology.
- I have been making music and writing music for as long as I can remember.
- I am from the UK.

There's not much else that matters for now but I will get to my point. 
I want my music to be heard like most artists, I make mostly dance music (whether that be progressive house or Dubstep). However I have started making game music and a lot of it is not online, just because of the fact that its more of a personal hobby rather than a potential career.

Here are a couple of links to my stuff: 

http://soundcloud.com/katnip-official 

http://www.youtube.com/user/KatNipOfficial

I have only recently started putting my music up on Soundcloud and YouTube, and I have not got that much plays or views on my stuff but it is 100% mine.
(Apart form the sounds used in my Sonic Remix) 

My proposal is, use my music for free (with my permission, so ask me first) if my name is stated somewhere in it, like credits or something. 

There you go guys, let me know.

Edit: I will make music specifically for your game, I put a lot of time into music production, writing and sound design anyway.

I wanted to show you the project I've been working for the exact past 3 years. Alegria is an open-source 2D gamedev environment for Windows written in C++. It includes an engine and a visual editor, and I've made some demos to show some of it's capabilities.

First of all, here are some screenshots of the demos and the editor:

http://i.imgur.com/3UAjGDp.png

http://i.imgur.com/iaTrHcF.png

http://i.imgur.com/6qQTtZe.png

http://i.imgur.com/KLcvhC3.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/iPOt9oN.jpg

I made this post because after all this time it's time to drop the project for an undetermined amount of time (or ever). I've learned a lot with it and I wanted to at least show it here in this subreddit where I lurk so much. It's in a usable state, but definitely has bugs, I don't actually intend the people to use it :)

So, all in all, I've decided the best I could do is do a little bit of a post mortem to at least contribute in some way to the community (more likely to contribute in the ""Things you shouldn't do"" department, but still). 

But, before that, [here is the engine itself](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iymviej8nekelqc/Alegria.zip) if you want to check it, with the editor and some demos included. To play the demos just run Alegria.exe. If you want to check the editor, run AlegriaEd.exe and open some of the demos (in the ""demos"" folder) or the launcher (""main.xml"") and play around! You can run the demos from editor too.

**What is Alegria exactly?**

Alegria is made of Alegria Engine and Alegria Editor. The engine is written in C++, using OpenGL (SOIL for texture loading), the Windows API (I know, I know, more on that later), Box2D for physics, OpenAL for sound and Python as scripting language. 

The editor is written in C++ too, using Qt as GUI library and OpenGL for the 2D viewport.

**Why did I make it? (and why didn't I do lots of games instead?)**

This is a thing I see around this subreddit (and other sites) a lot: ""Make games, not engines"". I think this is true in the majority of the cases, because usually the desire to make an engine comes from a weakness a lot of us programmers have. You probably know it: we feel the need/really like to build systems as generic as possible (""but what if I want to reuse this AI code to take build a machine to take care of feeding my dog?""), which gets in the way of actually finishing and polishing games. Which is very important...

...if you are interested in finishing a game. That was not my case when I started 3 years ago. I was in my 2nd year of college (CS student) and I had been playing around with Pygame first (dat Tetris), SDL after that. But after the third time I started my space shooter from the beggining (went from [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlSyTsQHltE) to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah-lvafWnUQ)) I realized I really enjoyed building subsystems for the fun of it. I loved adding features (did anyone say particles?). I REALLY loved working for an artist/designer, and I didn't care if I didn't have one, I would act as if I had one. 

To summarize, I love the toolchain/feature part of building games. I like designing and polishing games too, of course I do, but at that moment it was not my priority. Also, I hoped (and somehow still hope) that it would help me land a job on the industry.

**Engine architecture**

For the engine I decided to follow a component-entity architecture. It seemed the most reasonable thing at the moment and I don't regret the decision at all. I think it's a good choice for most of the cases, but it made specially sense given the fact that the engine was going to be multi-purpose, i.e. not limited to a single game and/or genre. 

At first I envisioned my engine to be used from code, so I made an API for a potential user to add its own subsystems while providing the basic ones. But, while that API still exists, I finally went to an Unity-like style, where the editor is were the developing happens. I decided go to an easy-to-use approach, where the only code the user had to write was the Python scripting.

The engine is structured as follows. Entities are basically a set of Components. Each Component holds data and is processed by one or more Subsystems. An example of this is a ball:

* A ball is an entity which has a Render Component and a Physics Component. 
* The Render Component holds the texture data and the frame of the animation the Entity is in, among other things and the Render Subsystem uses it to render using OpenGL. 
* The Physics Component holds the Box2D body which is used by the Physics Subsystem. The same with Keyboard, Mouse, ParticleSystem and many others.

With that in mind, I ran into the problem of creating the Entities. If I wanted to spawn an enemy 20 times, I didn't like the idea of defining 20 entities, and while there are several solutions to that I decided to creating the Archtype class. Basically an Archtype defines a game object, and an Entity is an instance of a given Archtype (similar to the class-instance concept). So if I wanted 20 enemies, I'd just create 20 entities from the ""enemy"" Archtype.

**Engine input: Scenes**

Another problem that arose was how to manage the different parts of a game, i.e. main menu, options menu, level 1, level 2... So I used the concept of Scenes (a.k.a Screens and many other names, you know what I'm talking about). And with that the engine became a ""Scene player"". The process to load an scene is simple:

* Open an XML with all the data.
* Load every resource (Textures, Scripts, Sounds) specified on the XML.
* Create the Archtypes defined on the XML.
* Create the initial Entities from those Archtypes, also defined on the XML. (those would be the initial objects on the scene)

And then the gameloop starts and everything runs smoothly. Changing from a Scene from another is basically repeating this process. PROBLEM: The engine has to read from the HD everytime it changes an Scene. Is it solved? Well... no, it's on the large list of things I would like to do but that I'll probably don't.

**Engine input: Python scripting**

So, how do I tell the entities how to behave? Very simple (actually, no): scripting. When I had to choose the scripting language for Alegria, Lua and Python were the two options I was pondering. And I chose Python. Why? Because I already knew Python and because I was (am) like super fan of the Blender Game Engine. And the Blender Game Engine used Python. The point here is: don't do that. Try to weight your options correctly. The other point is: it actually went okay.

I won't start a debate here, and I would recommend Lua 90% of the time. But Python did the job for me and I liked the idea of having such a powerful language avaible for my engine. I went for it, looking through the undocumented code of Blender Game Engine (open source, wooo) and got some nice ideas from there. 

If you want some more insight on how I did it, you can check [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1fyyge/python_integration_with_c_can_anyone_help/caf9asr) and [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1fyyge/python_integration_with_c_can_anyone_help/caf9asr) on this very subreddit. If anyone has any questions regarding this feel free to ask.

So, basically, to tell an Entity how to react (besides physics, which is a Box2D thing), we just call scripts on those Entities. But when do we call them?

**Logic**

Once again, Blender Game Engine was my inspiration. It uses a very clever system which uses Sensors - Controllers - Actuators. I decided to go for a similar route. In my case I used Conditions - Triggers - Scripts, which work as follows:

* Conditions: Events that happen. An specific key press can be a Condition. The same with a mouse click, an Entity collision, a timer...
* Triggers: Groups of Conditions. When every Condition of a Trigger is positive, the Trigger's Script is called.
* Script: The Script to be called.

So if I want a player to jump, it'll have a Trigger with two Conditions (the key press and the collision with the floor) which calls a Script (in which we apply an impulse to the player along the Y axis).

**Why not multiplatform?**

That's a fair question. The real answer is that I'm lazy and I realized too late that using a window manager would have been easier and better. One could argue I learnt something about managing low level thingies though ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

**Editor**

It was all fancy and stuff, but actually programming for the engine was a pain in the ass. Why? Because nobody likes to develop a game editing XML files, that's why. So I started developing Alegria Editor. I decided to use Qt because it's a very powerful library and its documentation is MASSIVE. Seriously, it's amazing. One of the best decisions I've ever taken.

I won't bore you (more?) with the details. Developing the editor has been just a matter of iterating and iterating, choosing different layouts, styles, themes and decisions. In short, it went from [this](http://i.imgur.com/OxLjJ.png) to [this](http://i.imgur.com/ucqhFtq.png). I am actually pretty proud of it (despite being a buggy mess) because without Alegria Editor, Alegria Engine is nothing. 

If I had stopped at the engine, I wouldn't had taken a step which in my opinion is very hard for us programers: interaction with the user. We usually tend to develop for other programmers in mind, because that's what we are. But sometimes (specially if you aspire to develop tools/engines) you need to go beyond your comfort zone and try to understand what the average user would like and use.

**The Demos**

Little to be said here. Those are pretty straightforward games that helped me testing and developing Alegria further. I really loved developing them and proved to me that games can actually be made with my engine, which is what I actually needed after all this time. I hope you enjoy them if you play them :)

1363068288.0,121,self.gamedev,1a4u8u,My experience with Pygame,150,29,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1a4u8u/my_experience_with_pygame/,"Hello,

My name is Nitesh and I have been learning and creating a game in Pygame for last 3 months. A couple of days back, I released my first game [Dungeon Fray](http://www.dungeonfray.com/), and I am pretty excited about it.

Here is my experience with Python and Pygame:

Python is a fantastic language for beginners. I have never learnt programming in schools and college and spent seven years of my life studying business management. 

Once out of the blue, I decided to learn a language and go into game development and when searching for programming languages on Google, I came across Python and fell in love with it. What attracted me most was its readability, so simple and straight forward, perfect for newbies :) For some reason I can't stand a C/C++ like syntax and it annoys me.

Before going into proper game development, I did write an application for Ubuntu Linux in Python, which helped me in learning basics of Python language. However, only when writing a game I learned about OOP concepts like composition and inheritance. Stack Exchange has been a big help for me in learning OOP, though I still don't fully understand all tricks and ways of OOP.

As I only know Python language, Pygame was obvious choice for me when selecting a game engine (I only came across pyglet recently). Official Pygame documentation and these two books have helped me in learning Pygame:

http://inventwithpython.com/

http://thepythongamebook.com/en:start

I also read source code of some projects on official Pygame website to understand how engine works.

Pygame is pretty great and fully featured engine and the developers have done a great job. The API is simple and easy to understand. Some users doesn't recommend Pygame/Python for games that need high performance and they are not wrong. Pygame may not be as efficient as other game engines when you absolutely need to redraw everything on game screen each frame.

As I have developed a turn based roguelike game, I have avoided drawing everything in each loop iteration. The idle CPU usage for my game is around 12-16% and it spikes to 30-50% percent when animating and I am happy with it.

I have been reading a few posts on r/gamedev and learnt that it is important to separate your engine code from game variables, player properties etc. I haven't done that and currently my code is ugly. If anyone else would look at my code, it will be very hard to understand.

In my next application/game I will try to make my code more modular and probably use json/xml for storing attributes.

Thats it, Its a great feeling to see your game released and appearing on a website :)

I am currently working on next update for the game. You can check out my game from http://www.dungeonfray.com/ and try demo from: http://www.dungeonfray.com/p/try-demo.html",,False,,t5_2qi0a,1363069975.0,,,True,t3_1a4u8u,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1a4u8u/my_experience_with_pygame/,

[Cube Café](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttx0uRb_pzI) is the result.  It's basically a game in the genre of those Diner Dash / Sally's Spa style games where customers come in and you have to respond to their orders.  With how the Sifteo Cubes work, we were able to add a satisfying tactile way to perform these sorts of gameplay elements that are usually just mouse clicks.

The Sifteo SDK is pretty fun to work with, although the environment is really limited by most standards.  If you're looking for a ""less is more"" challenge, it's a good choice, but you're probably not going to, say, make a first person shooter in it.

After over an hour of downloading and trying new games I decided to write this. While it is not a direct review or comment on any specific game, it is a list of things that bug me and things I love when playing a game on my Android (and I am sure it is the same for other phones / players as well).

First off I tend to buy at least 1 game a week, sometimes just because the free version was fun and I wanted to help the dev out. I understand most game dev's do this as a hobby, and believe me I do not expect the best of the best out there.

Let me start off with some things that bug me when I decide to download a game. (I always read the description before downloading and pretty much ignore comments, they tend to either be complete fluff or extremely critical)

* The description or title in no way matches the game play.
* I honestly don't care if you feel the game is the greatest out there or the most addictive game. I will decide for myself.
* I don't want the entire first 2 paragraphs about the game to tell me about other games you have. There is a developer button at the bottom.
* The changelog says 'fixed random bugs'. If I already have the game and I see a bug, did it fix it or not, let me know what you fixed.
* The game is actually a demo, description does not mention this. When you play a few levels it says you now need to purchase the game. I love demo's and if the demo is good I will buy the game. If it makes it look like it is a full game, then have it be the full game. I will immediately delete the game and note to ignore the developer in the future (I am looking at you G5 games).
* Placing a game on the store that does not have a demo for free. I can no longer trust many dev's out there and will not buy without playing first. Too many times I have been bitten by the 'ohh this game looks awesome' bug and then get it to find out I beat it in 15 min or worse, the game sucks.
* Ads that block a main part of the game play. I understand the ads and have no issue with them, but if you plan on using them, then plan it from the beginning. If you cover up the tutorial with an ad and I cannot see what to do, I delete the game.
* Playing a demo, then buying the game only to have to replay what was in the demo to move on. Some games I have played took an hour+ to beat the demo, I loved them and bought the game. Since its a new download I have to replay the levels in the demo. There is a great way to unlock the game built into android, use it!
* Ads that play video and turn on the media volume for the ad when I have it muted on the phone. While I have not seen this in a while it tends to piss off my wife when she is sleeping and gets woken up by the ad. My wife does not get pissed at the game dev or the ad supplier, she gets mad at me... I don't like a mad wife.
* Games that are almost an EXACT copy of another game with different graphics or only minor game play differences. I understand many game ideas have already been taken, but I don't want to play the exact same game again. Make it different, it can use the same idea but add in a bunch of differences in game play. I am not talking like 5 out of 50 points, I am talking like 30 out of 50.
* Games that require you to wait before playing the next turn because you need more energy. I will probably play the game for a day or maybe 2, but that is it. I don't want to play for 10min to wait for an hour to play for 3min. When I sit down (or lay down) to play, that's what I want to do.
* Games that have the in game purchases that are to enhance game play but in all reality are required to really play the game. If this is the case, just release a full version of the game I can buy for a 1 time fee.
* An over priced game. I will pay 4.99 or less without thinking about it, but if it is more than that I will hesitate. Why is my line 4.99, I have no idea. Probably because 80% of the games are less than that, but it is a psychological thing. If it is 6.99 I will actually sit there and decide do I really like the game and is it worth this. But at 4.99 (or less) I tend to just immediately hit buy if I already enjoyed it.

Things that I could care less that I feel too many dev's spend too much time on.

* Graphics. I am not saying that I want to see stick figures and I understand that graphic artists can be expensive. But If the game play is good, graphics are not a big deal to me. Make a good game and I will buy it. Get it out there and played, then use that money to get the graphics dev.
* Sounds. 90% of the time I play with no sound on or at the very least the music (not FX) part muted. It just is not important to me. I have never bought a game because of how awesome the sound is.


Things that I love about games and will make me buy more from that developer.

* A dev that is responsive. If I find a bug, I do my best to report it. At least acknowledge you got it. If you do not send me a simple response of 'Thats for the report we are aware of it and are currently working on it' I will assume you don't care about me. If you don't care about me, you won't get my money. A big plus if you respond when the bug is fixed and the update is released. This makes me think you really care about me and I will start throwing my money at your games.
* Something original. I know this is hard, but it goes hand in hand with the whole I hate exact copies of other games.
* Updates to games, if you release more level's content then I know you care about your game and fans and do not just want the 1 time fees as often as you can get them. I may have beat the game and uninstalled it already. If you add new levels I will most likely re-install it and play it more. This also will make me look at what else you have released and possibly purchase that.

I know that I may not be the typical teenage gamer and that this is not something that applies to all. But for me it is important. I figured I would throw it up here since it might cause some of you to get a new look at what a gamer thinks.

I have been working on a 2d dungeon crawler for the past 2 months and decided it was time to have another go at creating random dungeons.

Previously I had been using a linear branching system but it wasn't very fun as there was only ever one path to enter a specific room, and the dungeons didn't make a whole lot of sense architecturally.

My goals were to have reasonably compact dungeons (opposed to the sparse sprawling branches my old method created), multiple paths to goals, and to generally feel like they might exist and have purpose.

I have captured a few screenshots showing my progress, adding in various rules and systems.

I suppose it's fairly basic. It's my first time coding a game, or pretty much anything above 100 lines. The code is horrendous, very ugly stuff, you risk going blind looking at it, you've been warned. I coded the game in Processing, for those wondering.

Here it is:

Mac: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8dkzvcf061x7fm5/JunkShipMac.zip

Linux: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7agyfa1hicyjgtf/JunkShipLinux.zip

Here's the source code (if you have Processing this could run the game as well, I believe):
https://www.dropbox.com/s/0w2s471b9dyq7ce/JunkShipCode.zip

As far as sources go, there's a small Sources.txt file in each upload. Thanks to the sourcerers!

**The Game:**
Now, as for the game, it's an action-arcade shooter, at least that's what I've taken to calling it. The game has the player pilot this little ship that can shoot bullets (left click) and rockets (right click). The bullets can only destroy a brown earth platform. The rocket can destroy both the brown earth platform and the gray steel platform. There's a crystal platform that cannot be destroyed. Finally, there's a gold platform that can be captured (cannot be shot or shot through) for a huge bonus in score.

With your imagination, please think of these platforms as debris! Because we all know platforms flying at you is weird and slightly unbelievable. Also, your ship is partially broken and you can't slow down, only speed up. If you hit a platform, you slow down to the first speed. The speed increases act as score multipliers, so there's some risk/reward there as to whether or not you want to go faster.

**The Story**
First year university, second semester, we were told to make a game, we had the entire semester. It would be my first attempt at anything above about 100 lines of code, let alone actually making a game. Technically, there were groups, and I had a partner, but she never touched the code (she attempted a few lines of audio but it didn't work, so I wrote it). She did help, with some stuff, just not the hard stuff. That's a longer story though.

So, of course, I immediately get in over my head and start looking for assets. Damnit, the game mechanics suffered because of this, I had a lack of control because I was limited by the ""visuals."" Future attempts at game creation will be heavily lacking in assets because I'd prefer to work with game mechanics for now, instead of visuals. The game was inspired by AaaaaAAaa…!!! – A Reckless Disregard For Gravity, even though I've never played the game, just saw a trailer :P


**Algorithms and techniques:**

*Under Obstacle Class, which was probably used improperly as per the horrible code warning issued earlier*

The platforms will never spawn on top of each other (well they shouldn't, but... code, ya know?). I think this is very clever, but it's probably too simple to be so. The platforms are each relegated to a column (with a width slightly greater than the platforms themselves). Within this column, when a platform is spawned by the game, it is given some random x position in this column (say column 3 would be 200 pixels to 300 pixels, where the platform width is 60, the platform would spawn in this area if it were of column 3). The y position is determined a little differently. For each platform, there's this thing called the lowerBound, which represent the bottom of the obstacle plus some blank space, 50 pixels exactly. No other obstacle is to spawn above this lower bound. So, to determine the y position of the soon-to-be-spawned platform, all of the platforms in that column are found, and the *lowest* value of any of the lower bounds is found. Then the platform is spawned in a small random range below that. In this way, there should be enough space between platforms and no overlap anywhere.
Note: The Background class uses a very similar method of looping images over and over (randomly determined).

*Under Ship Class / ShipWeapons, I'm absolutely positive I fudged this, aw fudgesicles.*

This kind of... just works. I guess what I did was create a separate class representing *two* weapons (Why would you do this, past self? Just make two separate classes for each gun type and an overall abstract weapon class!) Oh well. Every time a shot is called (left or right click) the weapon class uses if statements to determine which mouse was pressed, thereby determining the type of weapon. Then, some calculations are performed (angle, starting position at front of ship). Finally, the bullet or rocket is launched. The rockets are never fired fast enough to require an array, but the bullets are. So the bullets are in an array. Every time the bullet is fired, the next bullet in the array is loaded to be ready for fire. Once the previous shots are off the screen or gone, they are reset individually (so as not to interrupt the entire array). For some reason changing the length of the array increases the speed of the bullets being fired. My reaction to this --&gt; [wtf?](http://i.imgur.com/4fFe5.gif). There appears to be no immediate correlation between the length of the array and the speed at which bullets are fired.

**Thoughts that went into it:**
When I was making the game, I initially decided upon just two platforms. The earth platform and the steel platform. The player was provided with some choice as to which weapon to use to destroy a platform, and the game was initially very fast paced, so even this decision was sometimes difficult to some players. However, I found with better skilled players, they could stay in a straight line, never forced to move. I attempted to solve this by adding a gold platform for score. Perhaps people like imaginary points? Alas, it is not so. Well, some do, but it was still very possible for a very patient player to stay in a *very* straight line (and still collect these freakin' gold platforms). So, finally, I implemented the indestructible crystal platform (sorta indestructible).

To spruce up the gameplay a tad bit, I added a shift option that has the player press SHIFT and some direction, and they will teleport to that direction with a shield around them for a short time. Since the player almost always changed direction with this, it still meant they had to move if they used it. However, the player could be at the end of the screen and attempt to shift off screen, but they won't move and the shield will still be applied. This means that they can technically stay in that same straight line as before, but there's a cooldown. So this isn't likely. 

Now, the game in its initial levels is pretty easy, I suppose. But, as the levels increase, so to do the number of platforms. Slowly but surely, the player is swamped in a myriad of interestingly placed platforms. The space between them is maintained as per the method described in the above paragraphs, but it's still very difficult. At this point in the game, I ran out of time. I tried my best to make an enjoyable game. I'm very proud of it.

So, are there any questions? I'll answer whatever you want. If you want, post your game and I'll try to provide feedback (it's only fair). We can chat about game theory, anything, really. Feel free to completely laugh at my game, or complement it. Thanks everyone!

**EDIT:** 

**FLOW: (The balance of challenge and skill resulting in immersion)**

A small note about Flow. One of the most important parts of this game didn't even involved coding, technically. It was figuring out how to effectively communicate info to a player in a fast paced game. The player, for the most part, doesn't have time to look around the screen while they're falling at a rapid pace and trying to shoot and dodge platforms (debris, damnit!). So, how do you tell the player their health? How do you show them the cooldowns? Enter peripheral vision! It's the only alternative, that or sounds, I suppose. The player's eyes are primarily focused near the bottom of the screen, so the most important info should be placed there, colour coded so that the various bars are easily distinguishable without taking time to look directly at them. The cooldown circle for the Shift ability in the top right is also just the right size to catch your peripheral vision, the contrast between green and red will do that. The reason the Shift ability cooldown isn't a bar at the bottom of the screen like the health (green / red) and the rocket cooldown (blue / yellow), is too many colours would conflict with the peripheral vision of the player. So I chose to separate it entirely. The cooldown of the rocket is faster than the cooldown of the Shift ability, so the Shift cooldown notifier (again, the circle in the top right), doesn't need to be viewed as much as the rocket cooldown. Health is important so the player can determine risk/reward strategies effectively.

Now to actually get to Flow. Flow requires a balance of challenge and skill (I'm not sure I have it in this game). It also requires clarity of information, so that's what I was going for. It's my best attempt at clarity. Does the player need to have the score and speed shoved in their face? No, so it goes in the top left. Once the high score is reached, the colour of the score part is changed to blue to represent this change. Again, it's subtle, and it's not too important that the player is notified of their achievement (It might be too distracting). The benefit of Flow is that the player ""loses track of time."" It represents immersion. I don't have the content to capture that, of course, but attempting to implement some of the principles of Flow isn't bad. I've been capitalizing Flow this whole time to let readers know that it has a special meaning as opposed to the traditional definition of flow.

Age is irrelevant to developing games.  In the end it's about the end product, the graphics, the storyline, etc.  It's not about how old the developer is! It's not what makes the game.  And it should definitely not be a marketing point, or promotion point at all.

Makin' a level generator in a block engine (Holy shit I've never seen that before!) and trying to get it perfect.

* Blended biomes
* Infinite terrain
* Deep earth full of usefull materials.
* Gonna be a sweet RPG, like Oblivion with blocks.
* Screenshots are of GPU intesive terrain viewer, not the game.
* Runs on WP7, Xbox, PC (not the viewer, the game.)
* Adamantum is not a typo. It's a reference to a typo we made in one of our previous games.
* Woke up sunday 9am and did not stop coding until about an hour ago. ~~Baught bort Buyed~~ Fucken having steak

Thanks for reading. I'm bed meow.

**Edit**
[Blog link here for way more info](http://craftworldgame.com/)

From the blog you can find how to get it on your WP7

Also, I'll answer the questions a smidge later, I need to get out and eat something, preferably something that was also capable of eating at some point.

But quick answers to a few questions I glanced:
1) We aim to be different to minecraft. Look at peoples super structures, servers, and creations. People invest thousands of hours in those things, CraftWorld needs to be different enough to warrant playing both for different reasons if you want.

2) WP7 version is all retro mode. PC version and Xbox version also have retro version, but also have a HD mode. It's mostly shaders and a hi rez texture pack. Models for items/creatures will also ramp up.

3) The inspiration for it was being annoyed in oblivion/skyrim. I've got 10 sets of sweet armour, but only a small collection of crappy houses with no means of displaying them. Building that game with a block engine fixes that. 

I'll write more later.

**EDIT 2**

I've answered a bunch of questions. Most seem to be concerns with being too similar to Minecraft. I'll cop that. But the short end of the matter is that the full design is too large to simply just ""do right first time"". We've gotta get this game out, paying our rent (hopefully) so it can grow into it's own independent, and unique title, and become a seperate experience in the same emerging ""genre"" as Minecraft, giving gamers cause to play both.

If I was rude to any of you, then eat it. I've got no patience for haters, they cannot be pleased. You hate inspires us to code harder, code better, code faster.

1341910928.0,113,self.gamedev,wbjcq,I talked to some Steam developers last night about Greenlight.,131,18,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wbjcq/i_talked_to_some_steam_developers_last_night/,"I was in London last night for an indie meetup with Steam.  They did a quick presentation about Steam itself, then introduced Greenlight, then we asked them a ton of questions.  This is what I understand about it...

---

Greenlight will replace the old Steam submission process from the 30th of August.  Instead of sending an e-mail to the 'gatekeepers' and waiting a few weeks for a yes / no response, you will create a page on Greenlight showing off your game and the community can vote on it.  The page will contain screenshots, game info, possibly a trailer video but won't support game demos for the time being.

The voting system appears much like Facebook 'likes' - each user can either vote for your game or choose not to.  Games with the most votes will be greenlit for publication on Steam (when the developers are ready).  They said they'd be tuning the system a lot after launch, but seemed pretty keen to accept the games that get a lot of votes regardless of their own opinions.

There will be a fairly sophisticated system for users to browse games, or you can drive your existing community there to vote (as long as they have Steam accounts).  I suspect the latter will be important.

Finally, if you've already applied through the existing system (or apply soon!) you are welcome to try Greenlight afterwards if you don't succeed.  And if you have had games published on steam before, you may be able to utilize your existing relationship to bypass the process.

There is already an export option (not finished, but it works) and the overall user experience feels better now.

A bunch of features will follow the next days, so feel free to leave me some feedback. :)

My issue is that there is an increasing number of 'starting out' type questions to the point it has become a major focus of this subreddit while I think this subreddit would be better off focusing on what happens after you start making games.

I would really appreciate feedback and suggestions, on the code or any thing you can think of that needs improving.

Some things to note:

- Unlike most entity systems, there is no fixed maximum amount of component types an entity may have added to it
- This library uses quite a bit of C++11 features
- I'm still developing it, as I have examples, unit tests and tutorials to create
- I'm wanting to eventually use an automated build system, such as CMake with this library, so compiliation is quite a lot easier.
- I've been working on this for quite some time, I've changed it a lot since I first started working on it.

Here's a link to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/miguelishawt/anax.

Here is a small example of it in use (It's basically a test, I have yet to put some examples in an examples directory): https://github.com/miguelishawt/anax/blob/master/examples/simple_example.cpp

What I enjoyed most was working with the lower level aspects of 3D graphics, such as direct manipulation of matrices for rotations, quaternions, ray tracing, graph traversals, and basically algorithms and linear algebra type stuff.  I built some pretty cool demos with OpenGL, C++, C and did some animations, and a little bit of work with GLSL.  Its been a while, and I am rusty. 

For many reasons, just getting a job after school was my highest priority.  It took me 6 months to find a job, and I ened up working for a small website where I mostly do front end development, with some rails and other MVC frameworks in PHP.  I have been working there for about a year and I really don't like it.  Programming that kind of stuff just isn't fun at all.  I know I don't hate programming, because I loved programming all the 3D stuff in college.

Anyways, I want to change my career path to something in game development but I am not sure how because I want to work on game engine code, basically the linear algebra, physics, calculus, type things.  I am trying to find an open source project to work on and contribute to, but I am not sure where to start.  I have been exploring github and the only engine I have found that I might try to work with is the Tourque3D engine.

*Edit:* Some answers to some common questions:

* Please note that this is still a development video and lots of stuff is still placeholder, not final. Many things, including the repeated explode effect, will change.
* Gameplay - This video is not meant to showcase the gameplay of Vox, meanly give an introduction and mainly demonstrate the intro/main menu and player creation/selection. I will be producing many more gameplay videos in the future.
* Yes, I am aware of the similarities to other voxel based games, such as Infiniminer, Minecraft, Cubeworld... I personally dont see the similarities as a major problem, same way that people dont seem to mind we have other similar games in other genres, etc COD, Battlefield, Medal of Honor, Ghost Recon, etc...
* At the moment I am unable to give any details about release information (date/price/platform), I am just not ready for that yet. One small, tiny, goblet of information I will share though, is that I am very excited/interested in the recently announced Steam Greenlight process ;).
* There is one person developing this, me.
* Development information : Programmed in C++, OpenGL rendering (I do have support for other rendering APIs), GLSL shading language.
* Finally thank you for all the feedback, good, bad, constructive, whatever... I am just happy that people take the time to watch what I am producing and give feedback on it :)",,False,,t5_2qi0a,1342198895.0,,,True,t3_wh75j,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wh75j/introducing_vox/,

After two years I was forced to hand in my employee badge for Pandemic Studios, a broken man.

I was taking 4 vicodin a day to dull the pain of a herniated disc in my lower back. Wrist braces adorned both my arms to help control the repetitive stress injury induced by long days of playing Star Wars: Battlefront and typing. The herniated disc – acquired on a rare crunch time day off as I stood up from my couch at home – gave me a bit of a limp, and as I hobbled through the halls of Pandemic Studios you could hear the painkillers rattle in my pocket.

I was heartbroken. I was rejected. I could not fathom why I was let go from the team I had sacrificed so much for. In time, I would grow to understand the incredible gift I had been given in my two years of industry experience at Pandemic. But at the time I was too immature, too angry and too disillusioned to process my experiences clearly.

I was a student during my entire tenure at Pandemic and still had a few semesters left on my degree. I sat in class, unable to take notes without feeling a deep burn in my forearms and I seethed. I had no idea what I would do after I finished college. I could not imagine the physical pain a desk job would cause due to the herniated disk and RSI. I would be unable to do any job that involved standing up for long periods of time. My future looked hopeless.

“How can I make them pay?” 

In the months following my layoff this thought popped up. A lot. It was a very soothing fantasy to imagine I could somehow extract my revenge upon Pandemic. Luckily I did not act upon this immature instinct, because my now 10 year career in the industry was built on the foundation of that first job.

I can certainly empathize with the [tale of Nathan (RC) Peters](http://kotaku.com/i-freelanced-on-halo-4-its-time-for-gamings-contract-510353357) and his time as a QA contractor on Halo 4. I worked at Pandemic Studios for two years. The first year I was an unpaid intern working 2-3 days a week and full time in the summer. The second year I was a paid tester, earning $10 an hour, working 3 days a week during school and 80-100 hours a week during the summer that coincided with Battlefront’s crunch. I was laid off as part of the natural team contraction after the game shipped. I walked away with a broken heart, repetitive stress injury in both arms, persistent pain in my lower back and legs and a Lead Tester credit on a massively successful Star Wars game.

Eight and a half years later the injuries have healed. My bruised ego has mended. I have worked for game developers big and small, have lectured on game design around the globe and have contributed to over 30 shipped games across every platform. I left EA and [co-founded a game studio](http://quarterspiral.com/). Whether our title [Enhanced Wars](http://www.ign.com/videos/2013/05/23/enhanced-wars-developer-demo) is or is not a success, as long as it is launched I will have accomplished a major life goal. I have a long career in videogames to look forward to.

Of course, I couldn’t see any of this when I handed over my employee badge. Or when I packed up my car, drove across the country and moved into my parent’s house in the suburbs. Or when the job working on websites with a childhood friend I moved home for collapsed. How could I see then that I would be able to make my game design dreams come true? As I stared into the void of an unknown future, fantasizing desperately about extracting revenge, all I could see was a pink slip.

I did not work at Certain Affinity. I did not work on Halo 4. I cannot speak to Mr. Peters’ personal experience. What I can do is share some things I’ve learned over the past 10 years that I wish I knew back when I was killing myself in the QA job that is the foundation of my career.

The first thing I wish I knew was EA Chief Creative Director Rich Hilleman’s “Shit in the bag” anecdote. You can hear it firsthand in [this spectacular conversation and lecture between Rich and Warren Spector](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVnkI_F6KKA&amp;list=SPC4AF467F9391D767&amp;index=13) at about the hour and seven minute mark. I had the privilege of working for Rich and this frame of understanding the workplace is one of the most important lessons from my 4 years at EA.

In the talk, Rich explains what it’s really like for leaders on a game team to be in charge. “They have a bag of shit. You can’t smell it, you can’t see it, but it’s there. And I guarantee you they know it’s there. And for the most part, your relationship with them is defined by this bag. You’re either putting shit in the bag or you’re taking shit out of the bag.” 
Rich goes on to explain that the secret to success on a game team is to make sure you are removing shit from your boss’s bag. Asking the lead designer to let you sit in on design meetings? That is putting shit in the bag. People are busy, crunch time is tense, and no one wants an unqualified QA guy wasting everyone’s time by “contributing” to a design session when he should be using that “down time” to perform unglamorous regression tests.

At Pandemic I was constantly trying to prove my worth, hoping for that moment when someone would “see my genius” and convince me to give up college and start working there full time. What I didn’t realize was that my enthusiastic attempts to impress were not helping. I spent a lot of time embarrassing myself without knowing, handing out a bunch of stinking turds to busy people with far too much shit in their bag to care about a lowly QA guy.

The second thing I wish I knew is that getting a job on a game team, especially an entry level job, is all about your portfolio of work. I thought I deserved a job on the level design team. Why? Because I worked 80+ hour weeks, hand shredded hundreds of discs, ordered and picked up team dinners, made sure new builds were waiting for people when they showed up in the morning and had some ideas for a tutorial level involving blowing up Ewoks. 

The true path to that level design job I thought I deserved involved building levels. The tools of game design are cheap and plentiful. If I had any sense, I would have spent all my free time modding Dark Reign 2 (a Pandemic game) until I had a built and released a large number of multiplayer levels into the player community and had tangible proof of my ability to a) use Pandemic developed tools and b) make fun multiplayer maps that players responded to. Then, perhaps, I would have deserved that interview for an entry level design job that hundreds of others would line up for.

The period of my life after being laid off from Pandemic was one of my darkest (which alone, shows what a privileged life I have led overall and that I really shouldn’t be complaining about anything). I spent 2 years at Pandemic and am grateful every day to the many people who allowed me to be there despite all the stinky turds I’m sure I left in every corner of the office. 

QA can be a shit job. QA is monotonous. QA is unglamorous. QA is thankless. But work is work; no one promised this would be easy. I owe my career to QA and the people and company who gave me that job. I only wish that back then, I had perspective instead of vicodin to help me ease the pain of one of life’s many inescapable setbacks.",,False,,t5_2qi0a,False,,,True,t3_1fljtd,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1fljtd/i_built_my_career_on_a_qa_job_a_response_to/,

Confess your sins inside,120,13,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/l8nqw/a_warning_to_others_i_fell_into_the_game_engine/,"**tl;dr** Ignored the warnings of falling into the Game Engine Trap, fell in head first, and lost about half a year's development time. Has it happened to you?

When you are a hobby game dev trying to work on your first game as time allows, little victories are big ones. In building my space combat sim, I can now give order to move my ship in space, launch fighter squadrons, and use them to intercept enemy ships. While this is very cool (for me) it's tempered by the fact that I have only now surpassed where I was 7 months ago.

I had been reading about Entity/Component systems and think they are a pretty good idea even though at that point I had not run into any of the issues that Entity/Component systems are designed to fix. Not being satisfied with selecting one to use, I decided to build my own from scratch. It was going to be the ultimate E/C system allowing complete Game Entity flexibility with everything specifiable through JSON config files. Naturally I had heard the mantra ""build a game, not an engine"" but this was going to be so beautiful and the architecture so simple, that it was worth it.

After an initial burst of progress, I started bogging down in unanticipated complexities. I still thought of what I was doing as ""working on my game"", even though the game itself entire disappeared from my mind. As the complexity and challenges built up, I avoided it more and more until I regressed yet another level and started reading gamedev blogs and listening to podcasts and while still thinking of it as ""game development"".

For no reason in particular I decided to scrap it all and start over. I have hard coded game entities with lots of plain old fields in them. Position/movement data is similar enough across lots of entities that I have written a separate ""component"" that they all use. I imagine this is how I will be developing going forward; straight-forward, old-style, uncool game entities refactoring out common functionality as I go.

I've made more progress in my game in the last 3 weeks than I have in the previous 7 months.

I have written this as warning to others and to myself, in the event that the Game Engine bug ever tries to bite again.

I've been working on [CraftStudio](http://craftstud.io/), my real-time cooperative game-making platform, for over a year and a half and I'm about to release a major update (3+ months of work) next week. I just uploaded this little trailer showing off the new physics engine integration (Bullet Physics through [BulletXNA](https://code.google.com/p/bullet-xna/)) and the redesigned user interface.

Thought you guys might want to take a look and maybe share some feedback or ask me questions about it.

The beta will also feature a HTML5 Web player (in WebGL) which I am very excited about. It's built with mrdoob's awesome [Three.js engine](http://threejs.org/) and [Lua.js](https://github.com/mherkender/lua.js/) which is a library to translate Lua to JavaScript on the fly.

The release happens on Wednesday, April 24th and I'll be running a free week-end for Ludum Dare right afterwards.

[x-post from r/learnprogramming]",142,35,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/qbb6h/how_do_games_like_minecraftterraria_anything_with/,"I've made a small game and the level gets constructed out of lines. The lines and objects are looped through to check if an object collides with a line.

It's meant to run at 60FPS but if I have too many lines/objects (I'm talking about 5 objects and 80 lines - nothing compared to other games), the FPS will already be dropped to 30.

So my main update loop isn't very efficient as every frame it's checking every object and every line. I don't know how else to check it, I thought about comparing locations first rather than detecting for collisions but that would still loop through every object and every line.

Here's some Pseudocode for the object handler:

    for(i = 0; i &lt; objects.length; i++)
    {
        for(j = 0; j &lt; lines.length; j++)
        {
            if(collisionCheck(objects[i], lines[j]))

                // Collision code
            }
        }
    }
    
Collision check is AS3's hitTest (compares bounding boxes), if that passes it does a more intense pixel perfect check. Even if all the hitTests fail, it's still slow. With this method, it doesn't matter if there's 1 object and 100 lines, or 100 objects and 1 line.

As the title says, I am looking for any books or resources that help explain the process of building a simple game. One particular thing that I would love would be if someone could recommend a resource that actually builds something while learning. I get the general process of game design, but I feel really lost about approaching graphics.

If you could recommend anything, I will be really grateful.

Thank all of you for the feedback. I have had a couple of big projects that have kept me busy from Reddit (a miracle on its own). I hope to start dabbling into the resources you've provided me.

I am developing my current project with SFML 2, so the code is more-or-less 99% portable already. My questions are:

* How many distros do I need to test on? I'm no Linux guru, but I'm also not exactly a newb, so I comfortable enough moving around different distros as necessary. I mostly use Linux Mint KDE these days. But how many distros do I need to test on to make sure it's good to go? I mean, do I need to test each desktop manager individually, or just focus on Gnome and KDE, since they are kind of the biggest ones? Do I need to test older versions (i.e. Gnome 2)? I could go on and on with sub-questions here, but I imagine you get the gist.

* How many distribution options do I need to build? Looking through my Humble Bundle history, it seems like *most* of them do 4 builds: a .deb and a .rpm in 32 and 64 bit flavors. Is that pretty much the standard? Do I really need a 64 bit build, or can I just assume a 32-bit build will work for everyone? Doing 4 separate builds seems a little excessive to me, but I guess that's kind of the way things go with Linux...

I hope this makes sense. Any advice you guys can offer up would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a bunch!

**Update:** Thanks for the replies, everyone. This info is really useful for me (and hopefully others). I appreciate it very much! (Have a round of upvotes on me! :) )

Also, I should be clear: we are still quite far from having a finished product--many months at least. I don't want to take too much credit for being the awesome, Linux-friendly game developer before I actually *have* a game released and working on Linux. I am going to try my damnedest to do it, and obviously you guys have given me a lot of great info here, but I would be lying if I said that I had any experience developing on Linux, so at this point, let's just say I am *hoping* to support Linux. :) This thread has definitely helped a lot, though.",,False,,t5_2qi0a,True,,,True,t3_qwa5s,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/qwa5s/deploying_on_linux_2_questions/,

**edit:**
Added mouse recognition compatibility with Firefox. However, it seems the algorithm is behaving differently altogether in firefox... (switching back and forth between paths) anyone have any ideas?

**edit 2:**
Woah. So there's a bug I'll never forget. I had previously calculated the ""height"" of each node (the higher it is, the lighter it is colored), and use that to calculate node-to-node g values (it is harder for the guy to go ""uphill"" than it is for him to go down hill). 

Anyways, here's the old code:

    tmpNode = {""x"":i,""y"":j,""height"":Math.random()*100,""block"":false};

and here's the new code:

    tmpNode = {""x"":i,""y"":j,""height"":Math.round(Math.random()*100),""block"":false};

And that's why you never trust floating point values!

**edit 3:**
Why did nobody tell me that my heuristic was inadmissible...? Spent the past couple of hours trying to figure out why my algorithm wouldn't scale. Disappointed in you, /r/gamedev... ;)  (update to follow shortly, with new visuals created specifically to track down this bug!)

**edit 4:**
It's a shame nobody will see this as most have already clicked through this link... oh well.

I've added a ton of functionality. Toggling start/stop, heightmaps on/off, brush size, making the map bigger, etc... 

But it turns out there's a bug somewhere- 

If the map is sufficiently big (it doesn't NEED to be that big, the bug just rears its head faster if it is), and heightmaps are turned on, it gets into a state where it thinks it cannot get to its goal even though it can... 

if anyone can help debugging, please do!

I work at a successful medium sized publisher (mainly PC) and I'm principally responsible for finding/signing new games. As a result I talk to a lot of developers - big and small, do most of the contract negotiations/writing, help find/define the business model for the games and generally try to make the games as good as possible.

Why am I writing? Well, simply put, very few on ""the other side"" actually talk about the craft/industry - this is true for reddit, forums, college/universities, twitter etc. Granted it's because devs outnumber publisher folks by 1000-1 (guesstimate?) - as a result there's a lot of guesswork regarding ""the other side"" - especially when it comes to the business side of things. After all - most of us got into this because we love making games - not because business is such a joy.

I sometimes lecture at game development programmes/courses on said topic and as a rule I spend 1 hour talking and 2 hours answering questions - so inquisitive devs are not a scarcity.

Daily I come across situations where great devs with great games shoot themselves in the foot simply because lack of information on the business side of things and having to play a game of ""what the hell are they thinking/what do they want"". I think that the lack of knowledge about the other side is a huge reason as to why publisher generally get a bad rep. Many deserve it - but there are valuable lessons to be learned for both parties.

So I'd be happy to answer as many questions as possible regarding any topic - publishing, self publishing, distribution (digital and otherwise), platforms, contracts, trends - and try to shed some light on ""the other side""

Disclaimer: I'll won't pretend to claim that what I say is the objective truth - rather how things are looking from this side of the looking glass. Ignorance isn't bliss.

Also - I'll start off anonymous so I can give your straight answers regardless of silly NDA's.

**TLDR:** I work at a publisher - let me shine a bit of light on the dark ""other side"" AMA.

I finally made an independent program implementing the correct algorithm with consistent triangle order! 

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/zHLab.png) the result!


I also made an effective quicksort algorithm based on distance from (0,0,0)!

Now I'm studying about the [Morton code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve#Coordinate_values) for correct sorting, and after that I want to install simplification algorithms and an octree!

If that's done and I have a proper view range I'll work on textures and map generation!

Tell me what do you think?

Any pointers to the future greatly appreciated!

...and as always, thank you for the help! 
**EDIT:** Oh, right, context, sorry.. '^^ soooo basically I'm trying  to make a game where the world is not cube based, but in order to make it happen I needed a good surface algorithm(BAM!). 

I also need to traverse the constructed mesh effectively. I want to make that happen with some kind of localized search algorithm. For that I need to sort a frikkin large array fast(via quicksearch. BAM!). 

But if I want to make a localized search, then I need to sort the triangles to achieve an order in the array(where the triangles are stored) where triangles  that are close to each other are close not just in 3D space, but close in the array(that stores them) too. In order to make that happen I previously thought sorting the triangles based on distance from 0 is adequate. It wasn't. The sorted triangle array now gives me a triangle order where triangles close in the array are forming a half-sphere. Now in order to achieve 3D consistency I need to calculate a Morton curve value for each triangle and sort them based on that. It will be a long run!

The interesting part is the series of events that followed. About a month later I convinced my mom to buy me a real game making program from the Scholastic book order (SimCity 3000 was a close second), spent 3 years making crap, and eventually found a small but friendly forum and learned how to make stuff that was slightly better. After a while the owner of the forum founded a web hosting company so I learned PHP to help with the programming, and decided I liked it and did web development for a while. Eventually I started transferring my web programming knowledge back into making games again and finally made [some that weren't too embarassing to show off](http://playvexillum.com).

(2nd attempt after quick last minute disaster!)

Ok, I've decided to put the game into open pre-alpha - hopefully I can keep this running constantly now.

For the uninitiated this game was inspired by an april-fool which showed an MMO version of the original game, but the other players turned out to all be AI. I wanted to see what the real game would be like and this is the result.

Changes since last time are quite minor to game-play itself; mostly just bug-fixes and usability tweaking:

* Map now centres around you
* Stars don't go behind the map
* Chatting doesn't fire bullets + added an icon so you can tell if a player is chatting
* Changed the speed + size of the ufo's to make them harder to kill

Perhaps the biggest change is the web-site; its been fully upgraded from just an SWF to entire site with a community forum where I'm hoping fans can help shape the future of the game.

I'm also going crowd-funded because I'm getting to the point where I'm running out of money (this is my full time job) and don't want to have to get some more contract work because that would greatly delay the progress of the game. For now I've chosen to do this via in-game purchases, which are simply decorative avatars. I understand Kickstarter is coming to the UK in the autumn, but this is too late for me :)

Anyway, enough blurb, here's the game:

1342723786.0,96,self.gamedev,wtwv6,How does Notch solve generating biomes over an infinite world?,133,37,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wtwv6/how_does_notch_solve_generating_biomes_over_an/,"I'm working on a 2D top-down game with an infinite world in my attempts to learn procedural generation.  Most resources on the internet seem to deal with procedural generation over a predetermined size and not in connected chunks.

Each chunk is 2000x1000x64.  This is so that there is at maximum, 4 chunks on the screen (this makes it easier for rendering).

The chunk generation is done in a series of stages:

* Generate heightmap using Perlin noise.  The same Perlin noise seed is used in each chunk generation, and the global X/Y value is used to make the world seamless.
* Generate rainfall / temperature using the same Perlin noise technique.

Now this is the tricky bit.  On average I only want to determine biomes once a chunk; I don't want the biome to change every 3 squares because that's unrealistic.

So I take the average of the rainfall and temperature of the chunk and determine the biome that is best to cover this chunk.  So I do this and then apply the biome to the chunk, but then the biome covers exactly the entire chunk, no more, no less.  In order to generate smooth edging on the biomes, I need to know what biomes are next door (so that they can be generated onto this chunk if needed).  **But it's a catch-22.**  If I want to determine the biomes next to the current chunk to create some sort of smoothing between biomes, I need to generate the chunk next to this one.  But that chunk requires the next chunk to be generated!  ... so on and so forth.

Minecraft seems to handle this pretty well, you can't tell at all where chunks begin and end unless one is in the middle of being generated.  So how *is* this problem solved?

**UPDATE:**

Okay so I think I've got this worked out!

I've realised that I don't need to actually generate the neighbouring chunks to work out what their height, rainfall or temperature will be at a certain point.  I'm *already* calculating those for the current chunk, so it's a simple matter of expanding the range of the calculated values to include the neighbouring chunks area.  And since Perlin noise will have the same value when fed in the same inputs, I can guarantee that if chunk A calculates what it's neighbours will be (without generating them) then those are the same values that will be used when the neighbouring chunks are actually generated.

Now that I have the values for the neighbouring chunks I can look into using some of the suggested smoothing methods so that they aren't so rigid.  I'll update again later with more details and some diagrams on how this is all working.

I put up the source code for this so that other people can take a look and see how it all works: http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wtwv6/how_does_notch_solve_generating_biomes_over_an/c5gtsn5.",,False,,t5_2qi0a,1342816486.0,,,True,t3_wtwv6,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wtwv6/how_does_notch_solve_generating_biomes_over_an/,

Check out previous posts for details on [setting your career goal](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1giewv/breaking_into_game_design_part_1_find_your/) and [building your portfolio](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1gsj06/breaking_into_game_design_part_2_build_your/).*

Now that you’ve built a strong portfolio filled with tangible design works, you may think it is time to write your resume and start applying for jobs. But the same way that when designing features on [Enhanced Wars](http://www.enhancedwars.com) I always set a design goal before writing the actual spec, there is groundwork you need to do to figure out what you want to achieve with your resume before you start writing it.

When I was deeply involved in the hiring process at BioWare San Francisco, I spent a lot of time working with our HR partners on identifying candidates. Although I would spend time on LinkedIn searching for candidates, this may be one hour or less a day because I had responsibilities on my game team. The majority of the searching was done by HR.

It is hard to explain to someone who does not have hands on experience developing a game the difference between a content designer and a systems designer. Or to explain that you need a systems engineer who may have previous jobs listed as a system administrator, but you don’t want anyone with traditional sysadmin experience you only need someone who works with cloud services like AWS. These are very complex, specialized requirements and there are no standards or guidelines around job titles and seniority levels in our industry.

So you end up telling the HR partner about the types of experiences you are looking for. You may write a list of studios to look at, job titles to search for or explain a number of types of tasks you want to see on a resume. “I need a designer with experience creating quests and scripting levels on an RPG. But he or she has to be well rounded. Ideally the candidate has experience creating user experience flows and designing new features on a live game.” 

I explain all this to help you understand what is happening on the other side of the hiring process. HR partners will forward the hiring manager resumes that come in through online postings, but will also spend time crawling the internet looking for candidates (mostly on LinkedIn). If they find someone that they think fits the requirements, they will send that person on to the hiring manager to ask if this is a candidate worth reaching out to. In general people on the hiring side are looking for key experiences on your resume that will convince them you are worth reaching out to for a phone screening. In order to prepare yourself to pass through this first hurdle, you must figure out how to sell yourself.

**Hero stories**

Part of the reason to [build an extensive portfolio](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1gsj06/breaking_into_game_design_part_2_build_your/) is to gain a number of design experiences to talk about. You need to think through those experiences and figure out what your unique selling points are as a designer. Everyone applying for a game design job is passionate, so don’t try and sell yourself on passion. Don’t sell yourself with unrelated skills or activities. You need to figure out what are the things you want to talk about when you get that hiring manager on the phone. You need to find your hero stories.

Hero stories are the stories of a real world experience you had that highlights why you are uniquely qualified for this job. The conversations you will have with people looking to hire you will be driven by the content of your resume, so you need to seed that resume with lead ins to your most heroic deeds as a designer.
For instance, let us imagine that I am applying for a lead design position on a mobile team. I would want to prove that I am capable of taking an idea from initial idea all the way through the process to execution and launch. I think that pen and paper prototyping is one of my core skills as a designer so I want to make sure I highlight it with a hero story:

&gt;We started prototyping [Enhanced Wars](http://www.enhancedwars.com) by first laying out our design goals. These were a list of bullet points that started with ‘We will know we are done prototyping Enhanced Wars when…’ then listed out things like ‘we have a game with no stalemating’ and ‘we have played at least 3 full games with the final rule set’. My colleague and I did 22 iterations of Enhanced Wars within 24 hours. Quite late at night, around iteration 16 we thought we had the magic build and called it a night. In the morning, we started the day by reading our design goals. When we tried to verify our magic build, we discovered gaping holes in the design and kept prototyping until we finally had a version that fit all our requirements with iteration 22.

Now, I don’t expect you to actually fully write out all your stories like this; I certainly never have. But what I do expect is that you think about the many design experiences you have had and put together a list of bullet points for your hero stories. Figure out how you want to sell yourself to fit the position.

**Write your failure resume**

Another important aspect of interviewing for a job will be showing how you have learned and grown from past experiences. In order to sell yourself with a level of introspection and acknowledgement of past mistakes, I suggest you [write a failure resume](http://creativityrulz.blogspot.com/2009/07/fail-in-order-to-suceed.html). This is an idea I learned listening to a lecture from [Tina Seelig](http://about.me/tinaseelig), the Executive Director of the Stanford Technologies Venture Program. 

The failure resume is a summary of all your biggest screw ups and the lesson you learned from those mistakes. These stories will be just as powerful as your hero stories, if not more so, when you are selling yourself as a candidate for a job. For example:

&gt;“At PlayFirst, I was given the role of Lead Designer on my second game at the company, Mystery of Shark Island. Although I may have had the raw design skill to do the job, I did not realize till many years later that I simply did not have the maturity level to lead the design of the game when I was so fresh out of college. One of the biggest areas of difficulty I had was in listening to feedback from the senior people in the company – I would often shut down their ideas (with poor body language and tone of voice) and make them feel like I thought their ideas where stupid. This negative cycle meant people did not like to work with me. From my perspective, I felt like the game was failing because other people did not understand my vision and I had to compromise it past the point of fun.
&gt;
&gt;Years later, I learned to ‘find the why behind the what.’ This realization came to me when working on Dragon Age Legends and getting feedback from literally the top people in the company. What I learned then that I wish I had known at PlayFirst is that other people are not as close to your project as you are. You know every intimate detail so it is easy for you to instantly see why other people’s ideas will not work within the framework of the game. But when the CEO has taken time out to sit at your desk because he enjoys playing your game, you can’t tell him he’s wrong. And in fact he’s not wrong, he just doesn’t know the project as intimately as you do. So what I did was to listen to feedback then try and identify the reason why the game was failing to deliver that led to a specific feature request. So, if someone would say ‘I want feature X’ I would reply ‘I think you are suggesting this feature because you are having problem Y, is that correct?’ Now we’re having a discussion about root cause and motivation that the game team can solve, instead of talking about the merits of a specific feature.”

By writing your failure resume, you will be able to sell yourself at a much deeper level. When you get difficult questions or are asked about past failures, you will know how to take a story about a negative experience and turn it into a positive experience.

Now that you’ve identified all the stories you wish to use to sell yourself, you are prepared to write your resume, which I will cover in the next article in the series.

I'm currently working on a game in c++ with lots of entities simultaneously on the screen. The architecture is OOP for base classes and I use components for more specific stuff. All my entities are stored in a &lt;list&gt;; side note, is that really stupid?

I'm at a loss of how to check for collisions without making a call with pretty much n^2 complexity.

e.g. psudocode

    for(iter = entities.begin; iter&lt;end; INCRO THAT ITER)
      if(entity is relevant) 
        for (iter2=iter+1; iter&lt;end; NEXT ITER2 BREWWW)
          if entity2 is relevant
            DO THEY COLLIDE!?

Obviously that is so inefficient it is funny, to you, not me, it makes me hate myself.
     

In previous games I never had more than 50 or so objects that I would need to check against so I never needed to worry about the inefficient nested looperoonal.

We discuss the origin and viral success of his two game projects, the large scale, real world tag game of Humans vs Zombies and Cards Against Humanity, the breakout success party game for horrible people. Since I know not everyone will have time to listen to a long interview, I wanted to share some notes.

One of the most interesting parts of our discussion was the card creation process for Cards. If you've never played, it is like playing a politically incorrect version of Apples to Apples. Cards is comprised of an 8 man team that do not all live in the same city, so they had to invent a concrete process to ensure a steady flow of ideas for regularly releasing expansion packs to the game:

* First, ideas go into a Google spreadsheet called the Hopper. This is an anonymous list of ideas and inspirations.
* Once a week, the team of 8 gets on a Google hangout. Each week, one person is appointed the Card Czar. This person is responsible for leading the meeting by choosing their favorite gems from The Hopper and pitching them to the group.
* Each idea is picked apart by the group. Some are work shopped and improved, some are thrown out and some transform into completely new ideas.
* Only if the full team agrees on an idea does it go to the Short List.
* A few times a year, the full team meets in person to finalize an expansion pack. In this retreat the team refines the ideas in the Short List and turns them into a finalized expansion pack.
* There is no hierarchy to the process. A card only makes it into the game if the full team of 8 is unanimous.

This process took a while to develop and refine, but the team now has a democratic and ego free method to design a steady stream of chart topping expansions to their hit game. 

Other topics in the podcast include the development and viral spread of Humans vs Zombies, how working on the Obama campaign informed the branding and messaging of Cards Against Humanity and what it's like to turn down the biggest retailers in the world.

http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/08/18/ludum-dare-24-theme-voting-begins/

### What is Ludum Dare?

If you've not heard of ludum dare already, it's a 48 hour gamecompojam (with 72 hour section for teams or relaxed rules), themes are voted on and then the winning theme announced at the start of the 48 hours; with which you make a game from scratch (your own assets, music, sounds and code).   The idea is to get as creative as possible with your interpretation, make something original, doesn't have to be too fancy looking, minimalist designs sometimes thrive.


### but I'm new to gamedev...

If you haven't taken part in a gamejam or are kinda new to gamedev, I (and I'm sure other previous ludumdarers) would encourage you to give it a try and see what kind of magic you can work under the constraints.   It's a learning experience and usually quite fun!

1400 people submitted games they made from scratch last time, for some it was the first game they ever made.

If you submit a game, you get to peer review other participants games (many people who irc in the #ludumdare channel on irc.afternet.org talk to each other and review each others games instead of doing a random selection alone).

### what can I use?

You're free to use things like Unity3D, UDK, frameworks and libraries if they're publicly available.  If you want to use your own private code stash, you have to make it available and declare it ahead of time.   Entries in the 48 hour section require source to be made available.  Entries in the 72 hour jam section don't have this requirement.

Language doesn't matter, use what works for you, the idea is to get your interesting game out there for people to play it once you've submitted it.   So, Flash, Java applets, Silverlight, Windows desktop, cross platform Win/Mac/Linux builds.

**History:** So little bit of background. I found a huge interest in the idea of using speech to things, anything and finally based on what I'm about to show you I implemented it into a GOAP (Goal-Orientated Action Planning) bit of AI to drive the Goals in a different way. It actually removes the world model being used to drive Goal Relevance and allows for user input to do so but that was just 1 application I found for use of this within some fun games coding.

**What are we making:** We are going to be using Microsoft Speech API (SAPI) 5.1 (XP on wards compatible) to create a sound engine (so we can disable Windows help commands) that allows for input from the DEFAULT input device (so make sure your microphone is setup as the Windows default input audio device) to use a series of Grammar rules (more on this below) for recognition of the users speech.

This has applications towards games and it is in this sub-reddit mainly due to my fascination of its application within games. So I'd like to see if anyone else would enjoy some playing around with it.

**Languages Involved:**
* C++ (Can be done with C# using the same API)
* Windows API

**Grammar Rules:** Before we begin we need to know something about the rules which our little application will work with. Grammar rules are created in XML and converted to .cfg files to be read by the recogniser.
So what is a grammar rule? A Grammar Rule is a piece of speech which the recogniser will try to match against.
...
    &lt;RULE NAME=""TEST"" TOPLEVEL=""ACTIVE""&gt;	
        &lt;P&gt;Testing&lt;/P&gt;
    &lt;/RULE&gt;
...

If the user was to say ""testing"" (or because it is an older API sometimes ""Testicles"" which is fun) the speech engine will respond (more later).
Grammar rules can be as complex as you like and even use dynamic content:
[Designing Grammar Rules - SAPI 5.3](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms723630(v=vs.85).aspx)
Note: We are using SAPI 5.1 but the XML is still relevant.

So now we have our Grammar rules for our first run. Keep them simple (see provided source code ""plancommands.xml"") for now. As noted above this needs to be in a .cfg format, luckily the Speech SDK comes with a Grammar Compiler (under the Tools section). Running our rules through this will give us a .cfg for use with the application.

    hr = cpGram-&gt;LoadCmdFromFile( L""plancommands.cfg"", SPLO_DYNAMIC);

**Initializing for Speech Recognition:**
*Source Code Reference: Speech.h -&gt; bool CSpeech::Initialize() { ... }*

Okay so now what we need is something that we can use to sort out our grammar rules. The first thing we have to do is bring in a sound engine, an audio device, create a context for the recognition to receive events and bring in an event handler!

This is actually quite a simple task. We'll be using *hr* to check for failures and killing the application should this occur. Near enough everything above is in fact a single line of code stored in a COM Pointer (be ready for a lot of CComPtr).
*Note: Check MSDN for more information on all of the variables used. It's a great resource for those not aware.*

I wont go any further into this as the source code will be linked at the bottom and is commented through (with further video links provided to my original source of learning this myself). Once this section is set up the only missing piece is to load our grammar rules.

**Grammar inside the main code:**
*Source Code Reference: Speech.h -&gt; bool CSpeech::SetGrammar() { ... }*

Now that we have our engine, audio device, event handler and a couple of other pieces (saying we're interested in everything that comes in over the microphone) we can load in the grammar rules.

Our recognition context was setup with the event handler during the last method of code:

...
    hr = cpRecoCtx-&gt;SetNotifyWin32Event();
    hEvent = cpRecoCtx-&gt;GetNotifyEventHandle();
...
    hr = cpRecoCtx-&gt;SetInterest(ullEvents, ullEvents);
...

So what we do in this method is to create a piece of grammar from a pre-compiled grammar file (the XML to .cfg conversion before). The main section of the SetGrammar() method I want to point out here is:

    hr = cpGram-&gt;LoadCmdFromFile( L""plancommands.cfg"", SPLO_DYNAMIC);

by using the SPLO_DYNAMIC option we can change the grammar rules at run-time.
[MSDN reference to SPLOADOPTIONS SAPI 5.3](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms717262(v=vs.85).aspx)
*Note: No change between 5.1 and 5.3 here so link is fine.*

The only part to watch our for is the option in setting the rules state:
    hr = cpGram-&gt;SetRuleState(0, 0, SPRS_ACTIVE);
[MSDN reference to SPRULESTATE SAPI 5.1](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms986388.aspx)

**Now we're all set up (finally):**
*Source Code Reference: Speech.h -&gt; LPWSTR CSpeech::Update() { ... }*

The setup code is the main bulk here but honestly it is quite simple after you understand what each little piece does (which is my aim here so if I have failed to do so I'll answer all questions as soon as I can).

The update code does a few things:
* Check for an event
* Check if the event was part of our grammar rules; otherwise report ""No recognition"".
* If we have a patch get the result from the recogniser into *pPhrase*.
* Get the whole phrase as text.
* Print out the phrase and give a confidence match to the rule.
* Return the phrase to main code.

For more information on these parts I'm once again going to suggest MSDN. You can set certain options to get sections of the phrase and different parts but honestly it is well documented there.

The biggest bit here when thinking about this for use in games is the confidence match.
...
    wcout &lt;&lt; pwszText &lt;&lt; "" ("" &lt;&lt; pParts-&gt;Rule.Confidence &lt;&lt; "") "" &lt;&lt; endl;
....

This is a value of  -1, 0 or 1 and is a rating of confidence based on what you said vs. the grammar rules provided in context of the phrase it's selected from them.
-1 = No confidence that it matches the phrase it thought it found.
0 = Some confidence in a match.
1 = If it isn't right then my name is Microsoft Samantha. (Oddly as noted before ""Testing"" in grammar and ""Testicles"" in speech usually results in a 1 match. You can train your PC to recognise your accent better).

I made sure that for my AI I only ever used matches of 1. This was to be sure to separate similar names of AI and to get a solid match when I wasn't using a PTT (Push to Talk) so it would skip most of my obscene rambling to myself.

**So we now have a recognised piece of speech... What do I do?**
Well this is where the fun begins. Luckily you have XML (Parse that shit in, son!) and a LPWSTR (Default value, conversion needed if you want it in another format) that matches it. From here the world is your oyster.

I personally begin with a simple 0 options just a list of names and had entitys being selected by name from recognition to begin with. So if I said ""John"" the John entity would turn and look at the camera.

I really enjoyed Speech Recognition as a little project and applying it towards a game environment. Hope some of this was useful to you and below you'll find the full source code (1 class, 1 main to run it, 1 XML, 1 config and the SDK), the original links I used back in December to play with this initially and a little bit of troubleshooting.

Make sure you have linked all the relevant stuff as you would with any other API (bin/include for those familiar with Visual Studio).
Also make sure the .cfg is in the correct folder. Just throw it in everywhere to be safe.

I generally enjoyed watching, but without much experience with game jams, I'd love to hear some seasoned opinions. Some small observations from me (if you disagree, please say so!):

* I thought Tektonic by grapefrukt was a really interesting and clever design. It was really fun to watch it develop from somewhat of a mystery, to a point later in the jam when things just sort of 'clicked' together. It really seemed like there was good forethought for the game's overall design, and I'm interested as to whether there was any written plan, or it was just all in Martin's *juicy* brain.

* I always enjoy watching Wolfire work, and think they produce at a really high quality. However, it seems like this may also be somewhat of a stumbling block. My perception is that this year came out a lot like last year, where perhaps the scope of the game they want to design is a little too large for the size of their team and the time they have. It also seems like they focus on finer details before it's necessary (something of a lateral rather than vertical development approach, if you get my meaning). But then, I have no 3D or Unity experience, so I don't have a good sense of what that development cycle looks like.

* I was extremely impressed with the Wasteland Kings by Vlambeer. It's fun, it's interesting, well themed, the music is amazing, and it just feels *complete*, while still leaving me wanting more. It took shape very early, and the times I watched them, it really felt like they had developed a solid plan (on MS paint, no less), stuck to it, and had good self-awareness about their abilities.

My hope for this thread is not to be negative. Rather, I'd enjoy reading some constructive criticism to the point of ""what we can all learn."" What do others think?

So really I need some sort of learning resource covering basic game and physics loops on the server and client and how the client and server communicate on a fundamental level.

I don't care what programming language it is in (if any at all) as I am accustomed to reading code of various types. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

What I am looking to put together is basically a first person shooter (deathmatch, ctf) but from a third person perspective. 

I will take anything from links to books to online webinars into advisement.

The closer to their tip you click the bars, the less the clouds grow. You can press and hold the clouds in order to make them shrink. The main idea is to create some tension between managing the anavoidable clouds' growth and the constantly rising bars.

To be honest, I'm kind of fed up with this project right now, which always happens sooner or later everytime I try to make a game, except this time I could make it fast enough to beat disinterest. 

Because of this, I honestly can't tell what's good and what's bad about it and I'd really like to get some impressions from you.

Please don't hesitate to ask anything about the development process!

Some of you may know me as Lobster who lurks this subReddit on weekends. I've backed [over 600 crowdfunding projects](http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/iankragh) since May 2011 while also watching the Kickstarter ecosystem grow and also helping to reboot many failing Kickstarter campaigns as a hobby. I hope you find this guide helpful even if it is a big read. Feel free to comment on individual parts of this guide with your own Kickstarter experiences, questions for me or advice for others.  

With this guide I want to go through my general approach to how I would create a project in the Video Games category on Kickstarter. Other categories like Film and other sites like IndieGoGo can have projects behave very differently and need to market themselves in other ways. Some of you may remember [TinyKeep's AI series](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1fbs5t/monster_ai_system_for_tinykeep_explained_part_5/). It inspired me to post this guide here first after it did better than I hoped. While some may not like applying the term pre-order to Kickstarter rewards, I'll still be using that term because it makes examples simpler to explain. There are also parts that are oversimplified to reduce space.

What degrees should I be looking into if game programming is in my future? Is the ""game design"" degree worth its salt? Does anyone here know if any companies take the degree seriously?

Edit:
I am looking into the development side of things. I do know how to program in a couple of languages (Java, Javascript, PHP, Lua, and bits and pieces other places), none of them are particularly game-oriented though. I know a smidgen of OpenGL and GLSL. My focus is procedural generation, and I am making a procedural city generator in my free time.

Edit 3: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rby1_MzDbxA this is a slightly outdated video of the city generation process from before I took it upon myself to learn GLSL. It should give you a good idea of what I know already.

Does any of that change anything? 

Edit 2: I am not looking to be a designer, I know all too well that there are too many people wanting to make video games that want to do so ""because video games are cool and I want to make my own."" I have had a few friends go into college thinking game *design* is right for them.

Keep trying to run the numbers in my head. They tell you not to be too optimistic when making plans but screw 'em.

They say selling a game on XBLIG for more than a buck is a death sentence. So let's say I sell, and I'm being very optimistic I think, 10,000 units. MS gets 30%. I now have $7,000. Then, minus tax, which could be as high as 20% of the initial 10K, I now have to divide $5,000 evenly between a team of 3. 

Leaves me with $1,666.66. Barely enough for a month's rent, let alone to continue devving. I hear stories about people quitting day jobs to dev. How could this be possible? Surely they wind up homeless?

Another bit of info: to develop for iOS you need a Mac, and a MonoTouch license. If you just want to test things on the simulator, you can use the free trial version of MonoTouch. If you want to deploy to a device or the App Store, you'll either need a student license (79$) or a normal license (399$). On top of that you will need an Apple developer license for 99$/year. In the light of that, please test with the trial first and make sure things work for you before paying either of the licenses!

Although, they probably won't have clockwork in the future. Space-clocks, perhaps. On the other hand, maybe game developers will still post links to screenshots and videos showing how development of their game has gone that week. Which is what we're doing here, today! If you've never done it before, why not join us, we'd love to see what you're working on. Throw hashtag screenshotsaturday up on twitter, so we can find one another over there.

**Let's have a topic this week.** Just because I've thought of an interesting one, it's something to discuss along with the images. What are your business plans for your game? Are you giving it away for free, or have you settled on a particular price point? Perhaps f2p, with micro-transactions, or advertisements, or maybe you'll do pay-what-you-want? There are so many options out there, what are your thoughts on the matter?

It's not our first game, we already published 2 Mac/PC games in the last 7 years. For a 2 guys team that's already an accomplishment. Two years ago we decided, as many indie games developers to take our chance on the iOS platform so after 8 months of work we released **[TITUS - Politics is not a game](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/titus/id440513050?mt=8)**. It's not a simple game to sell to mobile gamers... a *""dark and cynical political campaign simulator""*... but we really wanted to make something that's different from the typical iOS game.

The first weeks on the AppStore weren't that bad as TITUS was featured by Apple and as we got a bunch of great reviews (TouchArcade, 148apps...). Eventually [the sells plummet to 2 or 3 sells a week](https://img.skitch.com/20120424-taxffra5js58iadrtxgb77f8es.jpg). Until today we made $2.500. That's better than nothing but not that great for all those months of hard work.

Last month we were approached by [AppGratuites](http://appgratuites.com/), they promote apps who drop their price for a day. We already get emailed by other companies like this one but this time we decided to go for it: we worked hard on TITUS at least some people have to enjoy playing it!

**So there we are, TITUS is free today and [we're already #1 on the French and Spanish AppStore](https://img.skitch.com/20120424-d8q1arx2eiaj25825ubd9373x8.jpg)!** But what I really (really) enjoy today is the [glorious reviews we get from people](http://a.yfrog.com/img875/8513/42jlm.jpg). I though we'd get a lot of 1 star reviews after being free, it's not the case for the moment. You can't believe how proud this make me : )

Oh, and we don't have IAP, nor fancy things inside the game to tell your friends to buy it. Yes, we know it's bad marketing move.

I ♥ gamedev. It's hard but really rewarding sometimes.

---------------

&gt; **EDIT #1**: a couple of hours left to get TITUS for free. I'll post some more figures here tomorrow. 

---------------

&gt; **EDIT #2**: 9 hours after changing the price from Free to $0.99, TITUS is now #120 in the french game category, and in the top 20 in the spanish store. That was expected! No need to say we're not in the Top 200 US. Now our objective is to get back the 300 euros that we invested for the spanish translation we made for the occasion. We hoped to get enough money to pay for our trip to Unite 2012 but that will probably not happens :(

1307290001.0,90,self.gamedev,hs5y5,"My iOS app is being pirated, to the point where over 90% of the users haven't paid for it. What can I do?",148,58,315,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/hs5y5/my_ios_app_is_being_pirated_to_the_point_where/,"I just released my game, called [Kick Ass:
http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kick-ass-destroy-the-web/id436623109?mt=8](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kick-ass-destroy-the-web/id436623109?mt=8)

I released it about two weeks ago and as of yesterday saw a huge influx of users. The goal of the game is to destroy websites. To help users find fun sites to destroy I have a button which I call ""Site of the day"". This redirects to a new site everyday, and I am tracking how many people press that button. Normally I would have 8-12 clicks per day, but yesterday I suddenly had about 700 clicks (around 500 unique users). Of course I was excited, and today when I checked how many had bought it, it was not in the 1000s that I had expected, but 12. That's around 1% of the new users. (For an app that costs $1, that is not much at all)

So my conclusion is that it's being pirated. Firstly I want to know where people are downloading it from, what people are writing about it and stuff like that. I'm still hoping it's just a bug with Apples reporting software, but I'm not counting on it. I haven't been able to find anything off Google, nobody has written anything about it which I find very strange if that many people are using it. 

Many people say that the pirates will market it to people who are willing to buy it, but that clearly isn't the case hear. Those ~500 users who used it yesterday did in no way affect the sales. I really can't see anything positive about this.

I'm 18 years old, I've just graduated from highschool (Gymnasium in Swedish) and was hoping to be able to make some sort of living out of this app. Yesterday I was optimistic, today I'm pessimistic about my future. Why should I maintain an app where only 10% (I'm guessing even less) of the users have payed for it. Is there anything at all I can do? I'm feeling so powerless, sick to my stomach and generally depressed. 

I don't think I can topple the pirating business, but it really really really sucks how it affects independent developers.

Sorry for the rant.

**Edit:** So this post derailed a bit. Honestly I'm a bit disappointed; many of the comments are about wether piracy is good or bad, wether it is being pirated for the ""trial"" or simply because $1 is a lot of money. For me it has been bad. Before the pirating began I had around 10 sales a day, and after two days of around 1100 new users (or more, since the statistics I received is only from people pressing an in-game button), I have gained 10 sales. From 10 to 20. And I honestly don't think it's the pirates, I think the increase is thanks to some of you guys. So there. For me it has only been bad. 

And one more thing, I posted this in /r/gamedev. I did not think that so many people would say that I'm just being a dreamer for trying to sell games on the App store. Seriously, isn't that what this subreddit is about? Trying to help each other, encourage each other and support each other in their game-development goals? If my outlook is that it's a huge store and thousands of thousands of games, and that my change of making it is next to 0, why would I even bother making it in the first place?

But I am very thankful for the many insightful, encouraging and wonderful comments that I've got from many others. Thank you.

The fact as I'd love to have a lot of games on the list but I'm having trouble making it. Now for me to consider it a game every designer should play It doesn't have to be a 'good' game. Just  a game that can be easily dissected to help me or anyone else grow as a designer.   I'll try to update the list as often as I can. All I ask is that when you suggest a game you give the reasoning behind suggesting it. now for the list:



* [Mother 3/Earthbound 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_3): This game gives a great example on how to use emotional and Deep topics to progress the story without it being to obtrusive. In my opinion this game gives a perfect example of balancing between humor and the deep stuff. It was able to successfully make me laugh one minute then cry the next. 



* [Super Meatboy](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/):This Is a great example of how to make a game hard without being annoying. You die quite often and quite quickly but you never feel like the game is it fault and it puts you back into the action right away.



* [Megman X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_X_(video_game)): pretty much everything ego raptor stated [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpigqfcvlM&amp;t=5m53s) (semi-NSFW)



* [Steambot Chronicles/Bumpy Trot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steambot_Chronicles):""Despite a slow start, and difficult controls (on purpose, I think!) the game eventually draws you in and makes you actually care about the characters. You can dress your own character in many different styles, and develop your mech how you want (and change it frequently), but the real love comes for the NPCs you meet.
See, they actually have progression. Not emotional, like most JRPGs, but they actually have things they care about, and they accomplish them.
The main characters are in a band together, and as with most home-grown bands, they're stuggling to deal with life while they practice and put on concerts. Their first concert is attacked by bandits, which is a huge bummer.
And when I say they practice, I mean it. The lead singer starts out with a voice that makes you wonder what the developers were thinking when they picked her for the part. She's obviously got a long way to go. But by the end, her voice is really, really good. And the others improve their skills as well, until the whole band is putting on really good songs... Songs that you heard when they weren't good.
To this day, I want to go back and play it just for that progression. Sad about the controls and slow start, though.)(via name_was_taken): ""Despite a slow start, and difficult controls (on purpose, I think!) the game eventually draws you in and makes you actually care about the characters.

* [Any valve game in Developer commentary mode](http://www.valvesoftware.com/): Essentially the game directs itself. You hear why the developers and designers set everything up in a certain way. (thanks for the reminder anttirt!)

* [Metroid Other M](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_other_m)/other terrible sequels: Good exercise to analyze exactly what went wrong in terrible sequels like those, what did they remove/add that just plain didn't work. 

* [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/):  There are quite a few articles about why people love minecraft. But one thing that skips over people is the fact that its a great example of how **NOT** to introduce players to mechanics. 

* [Super Metroid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Metroid) : I could Spend hours Dissecting Super Metroid. It's great at being expansive but focused. The level design is set up to teach you as you play And its great at telling a story with very few words.

Here are some snippets from the article.

Pre-launch expectations:

&gt; We internally estimated that our nice, non-violent, cute game that requires reading lots and lots of text would not do so well on Steam.  We had beers a few days before launch and guessed in the $30K - $60K range for the year of sales; maybe $100K gross revenue for the year if we were lucky and were promoted a bunch by Valve. 

First day sales:

&gt; In the first day and a half of sales (launching at Noon on March 18th, running through to midnight on March 20th), we blew through our best expectations: $65,783. 

On the value of Let's Play:

&gt; Though MLY got a whole lot of support on gaming blogs and press publications, almost all our traffic spikes came from Youtube. 

Life to date sales:

&gt; As of this writing, the game has been out for just over two months, and has grossed a grand total of $177,019.

Remember that question about [How Notch does biomes over an infinite world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wtwv6/how_does_notch_solve_generating_biomes_over_an/)  Well I eventually got it all worked out and we built a flowchart-based editor for defining our infinite world generation.  It's pretty cool.

**Screenshots:** http://imgur.com/a/DLVqq

**Executable download:** http://ge.tt/2Co6pHL/v/0

**Source code:** https://github.com/hach-que/Tychaia

You'll notice when in the editor or looking at the screenshots that there's the X / Y position in the top-left corner.  If you adjust this, every example render translates it's result by exactly 1 pixel on it's own scale; i.e. at runtime inside the game, you can pass in the exact cell X / Y you want and you'll get a result that both tiles and looks really good.  The key is that all of the layer algorithms are continuous and that each stacks on top of each other, so you end up with one really complex, continuous function that results in an infinite world.

*An important note on source code / usage:* The procedural generation tool is inside the same (open) repository as the game, but the ""game"" doesn't have a normal kind of open source license attached to it since we're not yet sure where we want to take it.  You're right to have an MIT license on the tool (TychaiaWorldGenViewer folder) and the procedural generation layers (Tychaia.ProceduralGeneration folder) as of the writing of this post, which happens to [this commit](https://github.com/hach-que/Tychaia/commit/1c9537958fee8a0d44bad50393d28451366d248c).  It's likely that in the future even if the game is not under a standard open source license, it will be in some manner available in source form, but right now we're focusing on actually making the game ;)

It's an honest question.

Basically, it seems every month there is a new horrific Java vulnerability that Oracle is extremely slow to fix, and experts and government agencies advise people to disable Java plugins or uninstall Java altogether. I realize the exploits are for the browser plugins, but the general public being told to ""remove Java"" probably do not. With this latest one last week, Apple and Mozilla even started force-disabling certain versions.

It just seems like there is a lot of (justified) disdain for Java coming up these days, and I can't help but wonder if it is going to put Java in a position where people refuse to install it at all in the future.

Now, the reason I ask: I am currently balls-deep in a fairly large game project which is using Java/Slick. As a language/development platform, I really like Java. I know the language well, I can write good code quickly, and I really love using Eclipse. So this isn't another ""is Java a good language for game development"" question. It's more just ""should I abandon this sinking ship?"" I know C++/SFML well enough that I could make a somewhat smooth transition, but then I would also have to port all my code over, the though of which, suffice it to say, does not excite me (I am also not crazy about the offerings for C++ IDEs).

So, I don't know... I guess I'm just looking for a good old r/gamedev discussion here. Anyone have any thoughts on the subject?
