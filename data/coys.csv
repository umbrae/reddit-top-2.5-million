Ancelotti was wrong to bring it up.",223,31,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1jn9vx/breaking_avb_all_we_have_communicated_is_bale_is/,"**The video is up and can now be seen here:**

http://www1.skysports.com/watch/video/8853828/avb-criticises-carlo-conduct

This has just come in via the post-monaco press conference, I watched it on Sky Sports, recorded and typed it up for you guys. We might have some hope yet with the Bale situation.

From AVB:

&gt; ""I think that the rumours about that something is imminent is not true. Obviously we have allowed ourselves conversations with Real Madrid, confirmed by their coach, I think...wrongly.""

&gt;""But the only thing we have communicated is that the player is our player and not for sale.""

Reporter: ""It's just that there are meetings coming in the next few days for sure...

&gt;""...no, there is conversations because there is big respect between the two clubs, baring in mind the transfer last year and the agreement signed last year of good will between the two clubs, and the respect between them. So, I dont know what we are following from those instructions, the player, baring in mind the investment you are seeing here from Tottenham recently is of a player that is decisive for us.""

&gt;""We believe we have a very very strong team and you know, we are looking towards the future with Gareth. In the end you know in football anything is possible. What we have communicated so far is that, you know, we are not willing to concede in their interest in our player.""

Reporter: ""Have you prepared mentally for his departure or....""

&gt; AVB sighs... ""....no, I have been very very frank with you guys tonight, and I have extended my answer baring in mind what I have told you before. So I cannot speculate anymore.""

AVB's PR guy steps in at this point and basically tells them to fuck off and he has made it clear, before a reporter lastly gets in: ""Andre, you said Ancelotti was wrong to bring the subject up...""

&gt;""I think so, in my opinion I think so, I cant be a critic as Carlo is a person I appreciate a lot. And we have great respect for eachother, but...you know, baring in mind this situation, they have decided to make it public. Normally in situations like this in England are scrutinised by the FA with lots of care and attention. You know, we have seen lots of people speaking about a player that is not theres, and you know, we need some respect.""


**Afterthoughts**: This is the best news we have heard yet, but lets not forget...Bale was not playing tonight, he did not come to Monaco which is still worrying. He also sat out the BAT with this mysterious glute injury. The fact is until an official announcement on him staying, a contract extension or him leaving happens we really won't know. But keep the faith. ",,False,self,t5_2ryq7,1375575330.0,,num11,True,t3_1jn9vx,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1jn9vx/breaking_avb_all_we_have_communicated_is_bale_is/,

1. Gareth Bale is on a giant bill board in New York in a Tottenham shirt

2. Gareth Bale is on the cover of FIFA *2014* in a Tottenham shirt

3. Gareth Bale loves AVB and has said: “We have a great relationship. Last season we had a great campaign and obviously we came up short but we had a great working relationship on and off the field. We chatted quite a lot about tactics and stuff like that. He definitely got the best out of me last season and hopefully can again.” (actual words from Bale's mouth)

4. AVB has stated: “We have the chairman’s commitment that Bale will not leave the club.” (actual words from Andre's mouth)

5. Paulinho has stated: “Bale is their best player, but they have made it clear to me that he is not going anywhere.” (actual words from Paulinho's mouth)

6. Bale: 'We did a couple of seasons ago so there's no reason why not. We've definitely got a good enough team to challenge. It just depends on how consistent we can be. 'We're all looking forward to the season, hopefully we can improve on last season – I'm sure with a few more additions to the squad we'll be a lot better.' 'It's just a matter of going out there and proving everyone we can.' (courtesy of ExileTHFC)

Reasons why Bale is going:

1. Marca have continuously rehashed stories from the Modric saga and these stories have been syndicated. There are no real quotes.
2. A gooner reporter made up a story about us knocking back a 100 million euro offer and this story was syndicated. There are no real quotes.

Don't get sucked into this bullshit.

To sum this all up; Not all of us RM fans are dickheads but I am sorry on behalf of those who are.",,False,self,t5_2ryq7,False,,,True,t3_1jdmph,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1jdmph/this_bale_saga/,

1362823811.0,88,self.coys,19yrtj,BOLD PREDICTION: Spurs will WIN the 2012/13 Barclay's Premier League title.,109,21,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/19yrtj/bold_prediction_spurs_will_win_the_201213/,"Okay, we're a long shot. But it's 3 am and I am picking with passion. I have several **bold predictions** to make here and now. At least hear me out...

* Prediction number one: **Tottenham Hotspur will win the English Premier League.** 

As Wayne Rooney suddenly falls out of favor with Sir Alex Ferguson, pressure mounts on the shoulders of Robin van Persie. RVP musters just two goals in the final 10 matches for Manchester United, and none of the supporting cast can manage to make up for his lack of production. Including dismal 1-0 defeats to Stoke City and Swansea, a 4-1 drubbing at the hands of Manchester City, and a shocking 3-1 loss against Chelsea, ManU stumble to the finish. Their brutal 6-0 annihilation of Arsenal proves to be the only remaining highlight in their once-historic season. They manage to capture just 12 points in their final 10 matches. 

Meanwhile, Tottenham Hotspur are on what will prove to be a legendary run. Gareth Bale's stunning form only improves, and he scores 13 goals in the final 10 for Spurs. Gylfi Siggurdsson adds 8, Lewis Holtby notches two hat tricks, and Jermain Defoe slots home 5 times as Spurs win every match remaining in their Premier League campaign. They head into the final match of the season, home to Sunderland, with a 1 point advantage over Manchester United. Several loose dogs (11, to be precise) at White Hart Lane delay the match for 15 minutes before it can be kicked off. Because of this time difference, Spurs supporters at the Lane receive word at the 79th minute that Manchester United have won their match against West Brom 2-0, and it becomes clear that Spurs' current 0-0 deadlock is simply not enough for THFC to secure such a legendary title. 

It is just after this point, the 80th minute to be precise, that Andre Villas-Boas makes a vital decision: he takes off Scott Parker and brings on Jake ""THE GAMECHANGER"" Livermore. Though he receives just two touches in the defensive half during his ten minutes, his impact is visibly profound. But, despite this, the match reaches 85, 86, 87 minutes, and Spurs still cannot find the back of the net. 

At 88 minutes, Mousa Dembele hits a shot from the edge of the box that is deflected over the top of the crossbar by a sliding defender; it's down to Kyle Walker's corner take to determine the fate of Spurs. With his beautiful schnoz shining in the North London evening sunlight, he curls the ball to the penalty spot. The Sunderland keeper, Simon Mignolet, comes flying in and punches the ball away, high in the air, to the edge of the 18 yard box. 

~~Having been sent forward for such a remarkable situation, Hugo Lloris takes two graceful bounds outward, and in a moment that could only be described as ""perfect"", he sends his French frame gliding through the air, swinging his left foot in a spectacular half-moon path. As it connects, Mignolet stumbles over his unassuming shoelace, leaving his goal frame entirely unguarded. The ball soars in a diamond-grade, knuckling shake over every head in the box and into the back of the net.~~ 

...ahem. 

Gylfi Siggurdsson receives the ball gently on his right foot, and with one stunning Icelandic burst, he slips past two defenders to the left corner flag. On his left foot, he curls the match's, and indeed, the season's final ball to the center of the box. Cameras flash; spectators gasp; starving children in Africa devour four-course meals; crying babies sleep; North Korea surrenders its nuclear armory to the United Nations; and Michael Dawson heads home as the clock hits 90:00. 

As Dawson kisses his captain's armband, he leads a mighty charge of Spurs' finest across the pitch to the bench, where Gareth Bale embraces Andre Villas-Boas with unprecedented emotion. Though their lips fail to touch, even the world's most conservative panties simply cannot stay dry. Jan Vertonghen's hair suddenly (and shockingly) looks even more perfect. Scott Parker's spirit is finally freed to join its rightful place in World War II. Benoit Assou-Ekotto laughs a million LOLs. Despite no appearance from Clint Dempsey in this match, the talking heads at Fox Soccer spend an hour droning on about the impact of ""THE AMERICAN"" on this title run, but who cares? As the final whistle blows, North London echos with chants of ""come on you Spurs!"" and the world, for one glowing moment, is perfect.

And to top it all off, we all get laid.

* Prediction number two: **Tottenham win the Europa League.** Spurs beat Lazio 4-0 in the final, and Italians never utter another anti-Semitic word again. Lazio volunteers to pay hospital bills for every victim of an attack made in the name of bigotry in Europe. Emmanuel Adebayor scores twice.

* Prediction number three: **Spurs turn down 75 million pound offer from Barcelona for Gareth Bale.** In a frenzy, Barcelona pay 40 million pounds for Adebayor, which is immediately put to the purchase of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. 

* Prediction number four: **I will win the lottery.**",,False,self,t5_2ryq7,False,,num11,True,t3_19yrtj,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/19yrtj/bold_prediction_spurs_will_win_the_201213/,

Creative/Playmaker/Attacking role:

Gylfi Sigurdsson: Age 23, Icelandic. At age 20, he scored 21 in 44 apps in Championship for Reading. In his age 21 season, he scored 10 in 32 apps for Hoffenheim in Bundesliga. Then at age 22, he scored 7 in 19 EPL apps for Swansea. His age 23 season for Spurs was something of a bust, scoring only 7 in 48 apps (a lot of subs). He was asked to play out of position frequently, running down the left wing (probably with the idea that he’d cut in to shoot off his right). Good with both feet, but his success at Swansea came from making forward runs from deep down the center-right channel. His play picked up a bit later in the season (didn’t score a league goal till Feb 25, ended up with 3), and he’s had some good performances this preseason including a really nice back-heel through ball to set Adebayor free against… somebody (not Monaco, so no one important). Probably the best scoring/playmaking combo threat. Due to his time with Reading, counts as homegrown (English). Icelandic national team player, but, you know (ranked 95 th by elo, though they’ve got 9 points in 6 games for 2014 WC quals).

Lewis Hotlby: Age 22, German/English. Small creative dynamo (5-9, compared to Siggy’s 6-1) signed a new contract to switch from Schalke to Spurs in Jan, then Spurs agreed to pay L1.5m to advance his transfer from July to Jan. Through his age 21 and 22 seasons, he scored 13 goals in 78 appearances for Schalke. I’m sure you don’t need fancy scouting to know that a CL level Bundesliga side giving a 21 year old major minutes indicates serious potential. Didn’t score in 17 appearances after moving to Spurs, partly due to not seeming to have a settled role in the side. Was also sometimes asked to play out on the left (is left footed). Has 3 senior German caps, was captain for German U21 side. Concerns about his slight frame, but hopefully he’ll get a chance to show his vision and ball distribution.

Tom Carroll: Age 21, English. Some copy/paste with Holtby here. Small creative dynamo, Carroll is 5-7 and a favorite of youth system obsessed fans. Home grown product, is reputed to have superior penetrating attacking passing ability, but he has to play in a midfield where he is protected. Because of his size, he has to play slightly deeper so he has more time on the ball without pressure, but makes up for it was vision and accuracy. Has made 14 appearances for the senior Spurs side.

Transition/Box to Box:

Moussa Dembele: Age 26, Belgian. Part of the Belgian contingent, originally moved from Dutch side AZ to Fulham as a striker, but kept playing deeper and deeper until he became a midfielder. The 6-1 former Cottager came to Spurs in a release fee deal of L15m (rumored). Excels with the ball at his feet, can dribble through or around opposition. Very accurate passer, though lacks the incisive creativity of the Siggy/Holtby/Carroll section. Considered a tenacious defender and a strong tackler for a versatile player. Considering he’s a former striker, scoring isn’t really his bag (37 in 160 for AZ, 7 in 75 for Fulham, 2 in 40 for Spurs), but he won’t shame the team if asked to play as the attacking midfielder. Has a degenerative hip issue which caused him to miss time last year, and seems to regularly prevent him from playing 90 minutes. Has 49 caps and 5 goals for Belgian team.

Paulinho: Age 25, Brazilian. The latest Brazilian at the club, arriving earlier this year for L17.5m. Had 20 goals in 86 for Brazilian side Cornithians, and has been a regular fixture in the Brazilian midfield for the last year or so, scoring 5 in 17 apps (goals v Argentina, Japan (x2), England, and Uruguay, so real competition). Plays a rugged defense complemented by penetrating and deep runs forward. Exhibits stereotypical Brazilian flair from time, and can score with feet or head. Called the “black lampard,” which seems like a delicate phrase given Lampard’s past language indiscretions.

Cold Stone Thugs / Defensive guys

Sandro: Age 24, Brazilian. Nicknamed the “Beast” by fans and team mates, probably one of the best defensive mids in Europe. Sadly prone to injuries, has never made more than 27 appearances in a year for Spurs. Fans will almost unanimously agree that Sandro’s Janurary 2013 injury was probably key factor to Spurs failing to capture 4 th place in the EPL (either that or giving Friedel too many starts in goal over Lloris). Is very strong at positional defending, tackling, and aerial challenges, but is also a good passer and moves well off the ball to give teammates options. Typically makes safer, shorter passes. Has 17 appearances for the Brazilian national team.

Etienne Capoue: Age 25, French. Has played entire pro career with Toulouse. He’s a tall defensive mid (6-2), who has played at CD before. Considered good at aerial challenges, and a strong defender (though not as good as Sandro). I’ve also read he has a reputation for accurate long range passing (though not as good as Huddlestone), and being pretty good moving forward with the ball (though not as good as Dembele or Paulinho). Maybe a French version of Michael Bradley? (would make some sense, as Spurs new Director of Football, Baldini, used to run Roma) Has 5 caps and a goal for the French national team.

The “others” (aka: future transfer revenue)

Tom Huddlestone: Age 26, English. Hudd, or “Thudd”, is a big ole boy at 6-2, with about an extra 6 inches tacked on with a giant poofy fro. He’s sworn to not cut it back until he scores a goal, which hasn’t happened since the 2010-11 season (not in any competition). Huddlestone has good vision and really, REALLY sublime touch on long range passes. Sadly, he’s had a few ankle injuries in recent years that have sapped his speed, and he wasn’t fast to begin with. He’s a great regista, but isn’t’ a strong defender (his tackling being especially poor) and so slow that he absolutely has to play in a formation where he is protected by another deep midfielder. This basically mandates a 3 man midfield (either 4231 or 433, most likely). He’s been rumored to move to Cardiff (where they play a 3 man midfield) or Sunderland (where they don’t), but whoever gets him will probably be happy with the product they bought as long as their ambitions are mid table. He’s just too one dimensional for a team trying to contend for league titles and Champions League. Has 4 senior English caps.

Scott Parker: Age 32, English. Parker, who has a side gig as a Royal Military recruiting poster model (not really, but he could), is an old school terrier. He’s small, but uses good positioning, great technique, and dog cussing tenacity to defend the crap out of the midfield. He’s getting a little long in the tooth for a side with Spurs’ aspirations, but he can still play for someone. His lack of speed and fondness for sideways or backwards passing drew the ire of fans, and he got burned on a couple set pieces that cost the Spurs points late in the season after Sandro was hurt and he had to play heavy minutes. However, statistical analysis showed that Spurs played better with him in the defensive midfield role than anyone else, and near the end of the season, and had a few games where he showed a pretty nice ability to hit a wicked through ball that pretty much won a game. Rumor has it that he’s on 70l/w wages, so that’s a big bill for most other clubs to pick up, though he clearly has no significant role left at Spurs. Has 18 english caps.

Jake Livermore: Age 23, English. Spurs homegrown product. Least likely of these 3 to move along due to age/wage/homegrown status. Doesn’t do anything particularly badly, but he lacks Sandro’s gifts and Parker’s experience and tactical sense. He’s still just 23, and has seen time at CD in the preseason. I’d see him move on loan as more likely than on transfer (though I would have said the same about Spurs’ homegrown defender Caulker), or if he stays he’ll likely soak minutes in Cup matches.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So you can see the combination flexibility available. If you want a very attacking midfield, you can play Sigurdsson, Dembele, and Paulinho. Or you can match Holtby with Paulinho, so that Paulinho can surge forward and create space for Holtby to pull some strings. Playing away at the Ethiad or Stamford Bridge and worried about the attacking power of City or Chelsea? Maybe you ask Dembele to be a physical presence in the advanced role and field Sandro and Capoue sitting deeper, looking to Capone’s longer range passing ability to spring the counter attack.

I like that Dembele can play an attacking ball distributor as well as being the box to box, and that Spurs can play a super defensive midfield with Paulinho, Sandro, and Capoue, yet still have attacking from Paulinho, possession passing from Sandro, and forward passing from Capoue, and even that Capoue has experience at center back. I wouldn’t particularly hope to play Sigurdsson and Holtby together in the midfield, unless I was throwing caution to the wind, but I like that they operate in two different ways, so you can pick the one you feel is most likely to hit your opponents’ vulnerability.

So, regardless of Bale, I think Spurs have, without question, the best midfield (on paper), in the EPL, possibly in Europe, when you consider not only the top end quality but also the two deep setup at every role in addition to the tactical options it unlocks.",,False,self,t5_2ryq7,False,,,True,t3_1k1lt5,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1k1lt5/thoughts_on_the_central_midfield/,

I don't know why, but it seems many have turned into these spoilt fans who think that we have some given right to be winning every game as a matter of course and scoring goals freely. A given right to always be dominating a game. We like to think that we are somehow better than the scum in that department, but today - and indeed many times this season (season ticket holder), it has been like a library for the vast majority of the games.

We went ahead - it was great - there was singing as usual as you may or may not have heard on TV if you watched it. Then Newcastle score. Silence. Everyone immediately disheartened and pessimistic. I try in vain to start a 'yid army', but that peters out pretty quickly - not likely to start a song from the East Lower anyway. The shelf side and Park Lane were silent. Newcastle fans obviously cottoning on and taking the piss singing the usual jingles, which I would absolutely concede they are within their rights to do. Then we score again and its all singing and cheering, sunshine and rainbows. We had maybe one or two strained and half-hearted songs in about an hours worth of play. 

We have a 'sing when you're winning' fan mentality and that just takes all the fun out of going to the Lane and supporting first hand. Its embarrassingly sombre at times when its completely unnecessary.

It shouldn't take scintillating performances on the pitch to motivate the fans to sing. We don't sing when the players need it the most - like today, when we weren't playing with a lot of flair or cohesion. When the crowd gets going we are a different team. Its just such a shame that this hasn't been realised on a wider scale. 

Bring back the fucking drum.

Spurs bought Halilovic and Jedvaj for 20 million euros! Tin was the winter, Alen for a year

Author: Davorin Olivari
Posted: 19 minutes ago

We have resolved the transfer of JEDVAJ and Halilovic, we are all agreed with their future club! With a team that will remain with us (not saying who the buyer is), one of them will stay at least a year, said Barisic

What are Sports News announced, there was a rumour yesterday, today it has become official! Tin Jedvaj and Alen Halilovic have been sold! According to Dinamo president Mirko Barisic.

- We completed transfer or Tin JEDVAJ and Alen Halilovic, we are all agreed with their future club! With a team that will remain with us, one of them will stay at least a year.

Is the buying club Tottenham?

- Suffice it to say that they will go ... I do not want the name of the club out in public.

Has everything been signed between the two clubs?

- Well, we can say that everything is resolved.

And is the information that Dinamo will receive 20 million euros on the basis of these two transfers.

- Yes, about this figure.

Speaking of departures, is at the front door and Sime Vrsaljko?

- Važemo the best deal, but by 1 September will all be solved.

So Mirko Barisic. So it's all over, Jedvaj Halilovic will relocate to the Island. Although the president from the previous match was closed when it comes to the name of the club, all unofficial information suggests that the new club the Dinamo two wonderkids will be at isTottenham, the club with the White Hart Lane where great success was seen with (Croatians) Luka Modric, Vedran Corluka and Niko Kranjcar. Dinamo and Spurs have glossy relations, so that the outcome of the story is actually logical. Tin Jedvaj from Dinamo should happen in the winter transfer period when they will be of legal age, and easier to get the work permit. Alen Halilovic is one that will remain ""at least another year.""


--------------------------------------------

Let's hope to all hell this is true. Halilovic is an amazing talent, beyond amazing (champions league player at 16 years old).",,False,self,t5_2ryq7,1372621860.0,,flair8,True,t3_1hdpap,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1hdpap/croatian_wonder_kids_alen_halilovic_yes_him_and/,

On the one hand, we are in an exciting race for Champions League football in what is becoming a string of consistently competitive years. On the other hand, Spurs are still regarded as a ""small side."" This is a curious phenomenon - it is partially a meaningless, but also an indicator of how we are perceived in transfer situations as well as how our players feel about their club. Nowhere is this better encapsulated than in current opinions of Gareth Bale.

Bale's stellar form is drawing more and more speculation: ""When is he going to Real Madrid?"" Where is this coming from? Whereas Modric actively wanted to leave Spurs, Bale continues to be down to earth and always speaks of serving the team. Rather than coming from Bale's behavior, the speculation that Bale will sooner or later leave seems to come from this unspoken understanding in modern football - the big teams will buy the good players. This is only accelerating as teams are driven by the checkbook of their owners (Anzhi, PSG, Chelsea, City). This is not necessarily a negative phenomenon, and I am not attacking these teams. It remains, however, that our expectation is that eventually players get ""too good"" for their clubs and will move on to play for one of the giants. Consider these lines from David Hirshey's recent ESPN article:

""It's not just that Tottenham is overly dependent on Bale for goals -- he has 13 in league competition, including five in his past four games -- it's that he is Tottenham in a way that not even Robin van Purse Strings can claim to be for United.""

How can a team be overly dependent on a player? Yes, Bale is fantastic and arguably our best player, but why do we not say the same for Messi? You don't hear that Ronaldo 'baled' out Madrid for more reasons than just the pun not making sense. A hat trick from one of these players may make the news, but it will be presented as their personal brilliance being an asset to their team rather than a case of ""over dependence."" 

The idea seems to be that these ""large"" clubs deserve to have talent that can win games and sustain a season. The unspoken assumption is that players like Bale, Neymar, and Götze will move on to bigger and better things; the thought that one of these players may stick around to build their club seems only to occur to that team's fans. The concept of being a one-team player is now an oddity.

I see two relevant points at stake here. First, do we want footballing talent to be so concentrated? FIFA's fair play business is an attempt to limit the seemingly infinite buying power of certain teams, meaning a more even distribution of star players. I'm not saying that such regulations are positive or negative in nature, but that they should be considered seriously in relation to trends in the league. But second, saying that a team is overly dependent on star players is simply insulting to the team. Realistically, one of Bale's goals is only as important as a stop by Lloris or a last-second tackle by Vertonghen. That a goal from Bale is what goes up on the scoreboard makes it appear more important, but he can never never be more than one player on a field of eleven. I love this sport as a team sport - to see such value placed on a single player, regardless of their talent, that the team becomes dependent on them or lucky to have them is foolish. When Spurs take the field, you cannot separate Bale's performance from everyone else's.",,False,self,t5_2ryq7,False,,,True,t3_18bvq9,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/18bvq9/bale_vs_tottenham_a_rant_on_modern_football/,

Starting with the 4-4-2, even though the matchup for this game looked like it wasn't the most favorable to break out this formation, we absolutely dominated the first 17 minutes. We could have easily been up 2-0 if it weren't for Gallas being just offsides. Then, at halftime, he made a double sub to a risky formation and it seemed to really work. I know that arsenal were playing back and playing off the counter because we were forced to attack, but we looked pretty even for the better part of the second half...although the goal we did get from Bale was mostly solo brilliance, we played very well. Any time you're down 2 goals and down a man with the other team sitting back and you needing to attack, you're going to give up goals off the counter, it's kind of inevitable...

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that if you're looking for a bright spot today, AVB is your man and it'll get much brighter on Thursday...COYS",,False,self,t5_2ryq7,False,,num11-away,True,t3_13cqwu,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/13cqwu/dont_want_this_to_get_lost_in_the_awfulness_of/,

1) In an ever so slightly gay way, I would kill a man to look like David Bentley

2) AVB is a great guy and signed like 4000 autographs and took pictures with everyone that asked

3) Gareth Bale is a REALLY classy guy. He was like halfway done with the autograph line and a trainer came to get him and made him leave (and he was like 30 feet from me so needless to say I was PISSED), and he was like pointing to the trainer, like sorry, he's making me leave. All the fans made it known they were upset and he kept talking to the trainer and when he was like 3/4 of the way to the tunnel, the trainer finally conceded and let him go back and he came back and finished the autograph line.

There's been a lot of praise for our individual players on here, and I think as the season comes to a close the wider audience and media will realise just how many crucial players we have, and how AVB has created a depth in our squad that can rival the top clubs of the country.

During all those years of mid table mediocrity, I always had the odd favourite player that I absolutely hated to see leave us; Carrick and Berbatov was most notable. Every time we showed any sign of growth as a team we'd lose our best player and start from scratch again the next season. I had the same feeling at the start of this season when we lost Modric, King and Van der Vaart, but boy was I wrong. 

Now my love for that odd player has transformed to one over-arching person, the manager. He's completely turned us into a force to be reckoned with, and he's done it by bringing out the best in each individual of the squad, including Bale. Suddenly losing Modric, King, and Van der Vaart feels like a blessing. 

Those feelings towards the Berbatovs and the Carricks; they're automatically shaped towards the entire squad, through the manager. There was a recent thread in here that asked who our second best player was, and I honestly couldn't answer. I may be shot down for this, but I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea that Bale is our best either. 

Lloris, Verthongen, Dembele, Sandro and Bale are all world class players, and Walker, Dawson, BAE, Lennon, Parker, Siggy, and Defoe have all excelled majorly. We're third in the premiere league, and we seem to be chasing second, and we've done this without key players such as Sandro and Kaboul. We've also done this without a key striker. I can't help but think the only way is up from here; A couple of top players still to return from injury, making our depth even stronger. The summer transfer market to play with with the rewards from finishing top four, three, or even two. Not to mention the kinds of players we're bound to attract if the media continues to declare us the new best team in London.

Anyway, not sure what the point of this was. I just wanted to say an extended COYS and that the wait all these years for success is about to be well worth it.

I support Tottenham, and have for quite some time now. I am also a sports fan, who supports his local teams through thick (and mostly ) thin. Gareth Bale being sold to RM will set this club back for years to come, regardless of the money we receive and here is why. 

As a fan I want my team to win trophies every year, I want our players to be the best in the world, and our youth products to be the next big thing.  We are building something special the way United did with SAF, and Woolwich did with Arsen. We have the next face of the sport, dressed in Lilly White. We have what United had with Beckham. A player that regardless of what shirt he put on, will always be associated with United. A player that represents the sport world wide. 

With the new TV deal in the US for the BPL, and the growth of the Asian market, keeping Bale is more than just about the money, but about the brand. Spurs have a chance to have an iconic player be associated with them, something that very few clubs can boast of. Think about it, what shirt do you remember Henry in, Barca or arsenal? Beckham? Zhidan? Ronaldhino? My point is that this is a critical time for both Bale and Tottenham, where both are near a peak, Bale is about to go in to his most productive years as a professional footballer, and Spurs are at the cusp of becoming a world wide brand. Its time for this club to stand up and tell RM to fuck off, we don't need to sell our best players, no matter the size if the offer, because if we are to compete and win trophies, than we must have the best players, and it has to start here and now. 

I will support this club no matter the outcome , but we now have a chance to truly become more than a club, more than a team, and to become a true brand. If we are to dare to be the greatest club in the world, then we must do it now,""Audere est Facere"" to dare is to do.

&gt;Bale said André Villas-Boas has played a significant part in his development, improving his tactical awareness since the days of the previous Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp.

&gt; ""Harry was more 'go out there and play how you feel and express yourself'. With André, there's a certain shape and a style we play,"" Bale said. ""I think Harry was more free and let you do what you want. André does that too but there's a lot more tactical work. I think it's something that's good to learn.

For me one of the best things about the win on Monday was the celebration with AVB - Bale is clearly flourishing and in fantastic form but he acknowledges that AVB has brought him on this season.

For all the transfer talk surrounding him, that's my big ray of hope that we're going to keep hold of Gareth Bale. He seems level headed and as long as he, and the club, are progressing, he's going to stay. 

I ignore all the transfer speculation about him because I believe that if we qualify for the CL he is going to stay. He's in a good team and has a manager that is helping him develop as a player. Odds are he won't see out his whole career at Tottenham, but assuming the side doesn't implode over the run in like last year (and all the evidence suggests we won't this year), I think we're going to see Gareth Bale at the club for the 2013/14 season.",,False,self,t5_2ryq7,False,,flair7,True,t3_19etbx,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/19etbx/bale_grateful_to_avb_for_development_this_season/,
1362068733.0,55,self.coys,19ehjc,Announcement from me about the game on Sunday! Please read! (Competition),61,6,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/19ehjc/announcement_from_me_about_the_game_on_sunday/,"**Note: This is not the actual competition thread. The competition will start on Sunday. 1 hour before kick-off. The reason for this is so we have the confirmed teams for the match. It's no good predicting Holtby to score after 25 mins only to find out he is on the bench, or similar. Therefore please hold your predictions till around 15:00 UTC on Sunday**

Some of you may remember me from the West Ham match thread. I claimed to be a time traveller and told people the result, and I was utterly wrong. I may also have shafted the space-time continuum or whatever. However it did give me an idea which I am going to try as a one-off and wanted to let people know in advance so they can take part.

**I am going to run a competition before the Arsenal game asking YOU to predict the result**

Here is how it's going to play out:

**The Competition**

Around one hour before the match I will post the competition thread asking for your predictions. The reason it's only an hour beforehand is because (to my knowledge) that is the point where team sheets are submitted and when we will know who is actually on the field for definite!

You need to post a top level reply to the thread predicting the final result, goalscorers,  number of yellow cards, and times of the goals. This may seem like a lot, but it is purely for the purposes of tie-breaking. I would like people to post their predictions like (or similar to) this.

Spurs 3 - 1 Arsenal
Adebayor (4)
Bale (5)
Walcott (78)
Bale (93)
Total Cards: 12


**Winning criteria is as follows:** 


1. **(RESULT)** The result is top criteria. You must get the result correct in order to win.

2. **(SCORERS)** All scorers (or most scorers) correct. If you have more correct scorers than anyone else you win by default. 

3. **(YELLOW CARDS)**  If two or more people have the same number of correct scorers then it moves on to Yellow Cards. The closest correct prediction for the number of yellow cards wins.

4. **(GOAL TIMES)** If two or more are still level then it goes on goal times (on their own).

5. **(CORRECT SCORER WITH CORRECT GOAL TIME)** If people are STILL level then the person with the most Scorers with their correct time of goal wins.

6. **(EARLIEST POST)**  If by some insane chance two people have predicted completely identical results down to scorers, cards, and times then the earlier post wins. So don't copy and paste!

*Credit to slow_reader - for pointing out some issues with the original setup and for inspiring this altered setup*

Note: With regards to cards in the game, I've changed tack and gone with the total number of cards over the course of the game, because ignoring Red Cards entirely is kind of silly. One yellow is self explanatory. A straight red also counts as one card. Two bookings (resulting in a Red Card) will count as two (2) cards.

The BBC will provide the total number of cards shown as ""bookings"" and this is the number I will use. 

*Credit to KobeGriffin for saying Red Cards should count for something resulting in the above changes*

**The Prize**

I am not a rich person, I am just an average guy getting by with a little bit of money to spare. Therefore the prizes will be as follows:

I will provide one (1) month of Reddit Gold to the winner.
The community will likely provide a fair bit of (???) karma to the winner
The community may also admire you for some time! (unlikely).

**Other important shit**

DO NOT under any circumstance whatsoever edit your damn post. If you somehow manage to screw up massively either in spelling or whatever you have two options. (1) Deal with it. (2) Delete and remake your post if you have time. Any submission that has a * next to it denoting it has been edited will be disqualified. I am aware that I can see when a post was edited, but I do not want to trawl through loads of submissions after the game looking for a cheat.

If you want, you can upvote submissions that look like they might win. I promise to personally check all submissions regardless of their vote count to stop anyone trying to game the system. However a submission with hundreds of upvotes will probably make a good standard for easy comparison! Please do not downvote incorrect scores. The last thing I want is for people to be penalised just for taking part! Feel free to lavish the winner with praise, affection, and upvotes. If you are lucky they may offer to get impregnate you, or have your babies! (dependant on gender)

I will see about a grace period for late submissions. Likely it will be 5 minutes into the game (05:00 on the clock) or one (1) minute before the first goal is scored (whichever comes first). Therefore a goal scored at 3:49 will void any submission made after 2:49. This is to avoid any potential discrepancy due to feed/tv/whatever delays. I will be watching the game on Sky Sports in the UK. The fact of the matter is, as long as your submission is in before or at kick-off then there is no issue. In the event of any dispute my decision is final (unless the community bands together and proves me to be utterly and completely wrong on the matter!).

Theoretically you can claim Arsenal will win, and post a submission that states as much. However you will obviously attract negative attention and you may be ostracised from the community. However you will still get your reddit gold. The community will however be more likely to provide downvotes, insults and jeers.

**Finally**

If anyone has noticed a glaring flaw in this plan, please speak up and say so. Also if you have any ideas which you think could make this even better please post and let me know. Please also indicate your interest in this ""competition."" I mean, it's not like you lose anything by entering so you may as well. 

**Finally finally**

Please understand that this competition will be fun, with a token prize and it's more about taking part and having a laugh with like-minded people who just happen to support an awesome football team. If you dislike fun or are in any way allergic to fun, then please feel free to avoid taking part, or go support Arsenal!

5 First shot of the match and it comes from Sigurdsson, finding space between the lines. Now we have a corner.

6 First corner comes in, drops to Scott, he takes a touch but his shot goes over and Coventry have a goal kick.

9 Another corner to us after a good run from @GarethBale11 who crosses low but Coventry clear for a corner.

9 Corner is taken by @GarethBale11, drops to @TomHuddlestone6 who shoots but it goes over.

10 Coventry now win a corner their first of the of the match so far.

11 Corner comes in from McSheffrey but we clear the first effort and the second cross goes out for a goal kick.

13 Free-kick to us now wide right for a foul on Scott Parker. Sigurdsson stands over it.

14 GOAL 1-0 SPURS! @clint_dempsey with the goal!

15 Great passage of play results in a fantastic low cross from @GarethBale11 from the left low and into the 6 yard box but Coventry clear

16 Corner now after some great work from @Knaughts88 who cuts inside and shoots but the keeper saves.

17 One way traffic at the moment. Coventry clear the corner and we have it on the half way line.

19 Chance! So close. A fantastic run from @GarethBale11 who beats 5 players and shoots across the keeper but it goes just wide.

23 Chance! @GarethBale11 cuts inside into the box and shoots right footed across goal but it goes wide.

25 Clint Dempsey takes a shot. Emmanuel Adebayor gets a block in.

27 Benoit Assou-Ekotto sends in a cross, Blair Adams makes a clearance. Corner taken left-footed by Gareth Bale, Carl Baker manages to make a clearance.

29 Foul by Blair Adams on Gareth Bale, free kick awarded. Gareth Bale restarts play with the free kick.

31 Clint Dempsey takes a shot. Blocked by Richard Wood.

32 GOAL! 2-0 Spurs! @GarethBale11

-More on the goal; @clint_dempsey takes a shot inside the area it takes a deflection into @GarethBale11's path who taps in for 2-0

(Radio guy from City-Watford match just said City has now had their 8th corner, they're on for some sort of record...clearly, he didn't watch Spurs vs. Villa)

36 Corner to us now. @GarethBale11 to take it.

36 GOAL SPURS! 3-0 @clint_dempsey...we scored from a corner!!!

-More on the goal; @GarethBale11 takes the corner and @clint_dempsey rises at the back post to head in for 3-0

39 Steven Jennings takes a shot. Tom Huddlestone gets a block in.

40 Almost a chance for Coventry, a cross comes in from J.Clarke but @Knaughts88 defends it well from the on rushing Coventry attackers

40 Coventry force only their second corner of the game but Friedel isn't threatened at all by Moussa's inswinging delivery.

42 Coventry almost grab a goal! Suddenly Spurs are opened up and a slip from Naughton sees Leon Clarke with almost the penalty box to himself. However, he takes too long to set himself and the Spurs defender manages to clear the ball while lying on the floor.

44 Coventry are just beginning to exert a bit of pressure here. McSheffrey brings the ball forward and his delivery is cleared by Caulker for a corner. From the set-piece, Clarke brings the ball down and is set to pull the trigger only for the referee to pull it back for a suspected foul on Caulker.

45 Fantastic technique from @clint_dempsey as he controls on his thigh in the box, then flicks it over his head &amp; shoots but it goes over

HALF-TIME: Spurs 3 - Coventry 0

-Spurs legend Gary Mabbutt is on the pitch at half time and he gets a great reception as he talks about his time at the Club.

46 We're underway in the second half

46 Free-kick to Coventry 35 yards out and central to goal But it hits the wall and goes out for a throw.

48 Adebayor runs through on goal and looks set to put his side 4-0 up only to be eased off the ball by Edjenguele. The striker is claiming a foul but in reality, that was just a combination of very good defending from the Coventry man.

49 Sub for Coventry; Moussa comes off for Barton

51 Adebayor doing his part to convince Levy we need another striker...runs the ball straight out of play on a run

53 Excellent play once again by Bale who produces a gorgeous back hell that sets Assou-Ekotto away. The full-back collects the ball, jinks into the box and threads a ball for Huddlestone to strike only for it to be blocked by the defender.

56 The pattern of the second-half looks set. Tottenham a little lax in possession but still retaining a sense of control that is enough to stop Coventry in their tracks whenever they smell an opportunity. ""Forward!"" screams a Spurs fan. There's just no pleasing some, even at 3-0 up.

57 Chance! Sigurdsson is played in by @Knaughts88, he crosses but Coventry just about clear.

58 Spurs' best chance of the second half and yet again, it's come from a corner. Steven Caulker thunders in with a header and should really find the net but instead it flashes wide.

59 Free-kick to us now for a foul on @GarethBale11. It's three yards outside the Coventry box. @GarethBale11 stands over it...

60 Inches wide! @GarethBale11 strikes it side footed at goal but it goes just wide. Great effort.

61 Substitution: Connor Thomas in for James Bailey...if Thomas is anything like he is for me in FIFA13 managerial mode, he will boss the midfield and get 2 assists...we shall see

63 Shot from Coventry - it falls to Loen Clarke who takes a shot from 30 yards but it goes well wide.

64 Adebayor has really had a poor afternoon today. He's just halted another promising Tottenham break, with the impressive Edjenguele robbing him of the ball. He will be disappointed as he will have fancied getting on the scoresheet against Coventry today. Instead, he's looked rather leaden footed and off the pace.

66 Coventry win a corner and Edjenguele heads at the front post but @friedel_b saves and we clear the danger.

69 Chance! @GarethBale11 waltzes through the Coventry defence and shoots with the outside of his left but the keeper makes a great save.

70 We make our first sub and it's @GarethBale11 who comes off to a standing ovation and is replaced by @andros_townsend.

70 Coventry also make a sub as Jennings comes off for Fleck. (They've now put in half my FIFA13 managerial team)

72 The tempo has completely dropped now and no surprises that has happened after Gareth Bale has left the field. Coventry are still fighting hard but unfortunately, they just don't have the quality to make any inroads. Clint Dempsey has an ambitious effort that goes nowhere near.

79 Crickets...

79 Double substitution for us as Sigurdsson &amp; Scott Parker come off for @tom_carroll92 &amp; @mousadembele

83 Chance! @andros_townsend is played in by @clint_dempsey, he crosses with power and pace but Coventry clear.

84 Chance! @andros_townsend picks up the ball and runs at Adams, he cuts back onto his right foot and shoots, but it goes just wide

86 Free-kick to us now for a foul on Caulker who came marauding forwards from defence. 40 yards out, slightly left of goal.

86 @TomHuddlestone6 touches the free-kick to @clint_dempsey who shoots low and hard but it goes wide. Good effort.

88 Chance! We counter and work the ball to @andros_townsend who cuts inside onto his left and shoots inches wide!

90+1 The Coventry fans are jumping up and down, thinking they've grabbed a consolation through Gary McSheffrey but the flag was up for offside very early against him. Only two more minutes left here of added time.

Full time: Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 Coventry City. SPURS HAVE FAILED TO SCORE IN AN ENTIRE HALF AGAINST LOWLY COVENTRY CITY #AVBOUT!!!!!!

1370005992.0,51,self.coys,1fegup,A Frank Discussion of Bale; the Transfer Sagaa,55,4,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1fegup/a_frank_discussion_of_bale_the_transfer_sagaa/,"For the sake of the sanity of all who wake up in cold sweats every night thinking about the possibility of Bale being sold, I think it's time we had a real discussion about how Bale being sold could come about. To that end, I'd like to put forward a few ideas.

1) Remember, that a successful transfer has Multiple parts to it;  A club who wants to buy, a Club who's willing to sell, and a player who's willing to move. Clearly, there are plenty of clubs out there who want to buy Bale, and yes, it's pretty clear he would be willing to move. But you have to remember that middle part of the equation; *We have to want to sell him.*

Articles like [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22702910) are pretty useless, because they assume that Spurs are going to, or want to sell. Please, take the time to read into these articles deeper; the sub-title on this one make it pretty clear that the answer means nothing at all;

&gt; Gareth Bale would listen to an offer from Real Madrid **if they agreed a fee with Tottenham**, according to his agent.

That middle part is key. Why? Because look at how the Modric saga went down. Which brings me to my next point;

2) Even if we end up selling Bale, we're going to be well compensated; so well, in fact, that it's possible we'll end up a better team than before. How is that possible, you ask? Well, let's look at the numbers. The current transfer price for Bale seems to be around £80 million. With that kind of money, we can go out and buy Benteke (asking price £15 million), Christian Eriksen (asking price £15 million), Younes Belhanda (we apparentely bid £10 million, so let's assume another £15 million) and then a further £15 million on Luke Shaw at left back, and STILL let Levy pocket £20 million for the new stadium.

That's 4 players, all of whom are under 25 and well regarded as up-and-coming stars, all of whom would contribute to the squad pretty quickly, AND leaves us with money to throw at the stadium.

3) Finally, I want to raise a point about the player's willingness to go, the final part of the transfer equation. Yes it's obvious that he'd listen to offers, that much has been made clear. But that doesn't mean he'd accept one. Think about it this way; Your current company has offered to make you their highest paid employee. You have a 6 month old daughter, your first child. And now other companies are coming in for you, and yes, they're bigger and better companies, but you wouldn't be the centerpiece for them. Especially since you just saw one of your colleagues move to a company and be dubbed “the worst new hiring”, wouldn't you be a little wary of moving? Bale knows he has a good thing at Spurs, but as we learned from the previous transfer saga of Modric, the chances Levy sells inside England are basically non-existent. So you have to assume he's being sold overseas. There's no reason to go to PSG except money; it's not a better league, it's not even really a bigger club than Spurs internationally. That leaves really 2 clubs who've shown interest; Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.

But both teams already have established midfield attacking options, and very good ones too. Bayern have Ribery, Goetze, Muller and Robben; only Goetze isn't an established player who Bale would have to displace, and though Pep is great at handling egos, you've got to assume that all those players would get significant time; does Bale want to be sharing time with anyone right now?

Real Madrid doesn't really seem any better; Ronaldo, Mesut Ozil, Angel di Maria, and Kaka all around as attacking midfield options; I'm not saying Bale isn't a starter there, but Real will want all of them to play regularly, and that will cut into Bale's time. He won't simply walk in and be an every game starter, as he saw with Modric. 

And remember; he's never said he wants to leave Tottenham, just that he would like the challenge (at some point in his career) of playing for one of the biggest clubs in Europe. He hasn't said he wants out; he hasn't put in a transfer request.

In conclusion, I think that 2 of the 3 pieces of the transfer equation (us selling, Bale wanting to go), things aren't a foregone conclusion that he will be sold. So everyone assuming that he's gone, or that we have to sell him, I think are just dead wrong.

Updates (hopefully)

3' Walker with a chance to control the ball outside the box, bad first touch however.

5' Bale nearly touched the ball with his right foot, took a shot down the left side, sending the ball wide.

8' Dembele picks up the first yellow of the evening for a slightly rash challenge after not being given a freekick himself.

11'  Lloris with two quality saves already.  Things look about even so far.

13' Bale GOAL!  West Ham error gives Bale the ball outside the box and he slots it in.  Could have been saved.  He's pretty good.

16'  Parker spin number two I believe?

18' Lloris off the line to clear a one on one chance.

23' Walker with his second horrible shot of the match.  

24' Bale with a chance on goal, hits it poorly.  Had all 3 defenders uncomfortable just by having the ball.

25' PENALTY to West Ham, which Carroll converts.  Parker in two footed and gets the ball and the man. 1-1.

34' Bale with an overhead kick that went somewhere, not in the goal.

36' Taylor on for Nolan.

39' Walker with a very nice block on Jarvis in the box.

43' Great through-ball from Dembele to Holtby who plays it to his left and has a poor shot.  Never mind, it was deflected, which resulted in a great save from Jaaskelainen.

45' Two minutes of added time.

47' Holtby fouled pretty far outside the box, Bale with the free kick which goes wide right.  He is human after all.

Back on

48' Caulker with another header which produces another great save.  Put one in Caulker!

49' Dembele brings down Cole to the side of the box.  Needs to be careful to avoid another yellow.

52' muetrecaza just said ""I think Bale should just start trying to curl it into the net on corners."" four times

57' Bale shot off the post- correction it was Gylfi who must have come on for Holtby at some point, Ade heads it straight into the keeper, who isn't standing.  Should have been a goal.

58' Cole GOAL as a result of a horrible defensive lapse. 2-1 West Ham.

62' Diame booked for foul on Bale outside the box.

63' Bale's free kick goes well over the goal.

67' Gylfi with an attempt which goes to the right of the goal.  Otherwise, not much.

69'  Bale with an effort from the edge of the box, tipped over.  Starting to think we need someone else to score.

71' O'Neil receives a yellow for bad imitation of Adebayor's hair, which is a bad imitation of a regular haircut.

72' Bale with another free kick over the goal.  

72' Demel off for Pogatetz

74'  Lloris with another brilliant save on the last man.

75' Carroll (the good one) on for Dembele.

76' Gylfi GOAL.  I keep saying he needs more time.  I know everything!  WOO 2-2.

81' Jaaskelainen with another save.  He's having an immaculate match.  Sucks.

81' And another save, this time from a header from Adebayor. 

82' Yellow for Collins for foul on Bale.

83' 70% for Spurs in last 10 minutes.

84' Diame off for Collinson.

88' Livermore on for Parker.

90' BALE SCORES OUTSIDE THE BOX 3-2

He is so fucking good.  It's incredible.  Love watching him.  I'll give Carroll the assist for the hell of it.

90' Four minutes of added time.  Everyone went and hugged AvB.

We all wanted that game for obvious reasons. But let's not go calling for everyone's head and freaking out.

We played the league leaders as tough as they have been played and could have legitimately come out with a draw or even three points had we not shot ourselves in the foot/been missing our two biggest contributors. We are sitting in 5th behind a blazing hot Everton, trust fund fc and the manchesters. About exactly where you'd expect us to be. 

**In regards to our opponents:**

Outside of Mata, their vaunted attacking four did not cause major issues, their best offensive contributions came from our own players and of some shit luck for us. 

**Attack**

Our own attack was decent at best. Lennon is looking like having a monster season and terrorized them, Had Bale been on they would have shit the bed. THudd played well enough to give us a quality option when we need to rest Moussa, and Jan was again a threat going forward. JD does what JD always does, frustrate all of us and his teammates going forward and then finds a goal. He did look quality out on the left late in the match though and that option is intriguing. Ade needs to play. Period, he's been decent when he's played but he quite frankly needs to start and play in order for his full effect to be seen. 

**Midfield**

Dempsey looked overmatched and tried to do way too much in his own without Dembele and Bale to threaten alongside him. He has not been more than decent at best so far, but he works best in space which he can move and pop up in the box. The space is not created without a hold up striker, wing play and a controlling mid. Ade, moussa, bale. He can play well for us but I agree with most that Gylfi needs to be seen and given an opportunity to establish himself. His set pieces are gorgeous and his vision and through balls can be deadly. Again though, he operates best in the kind of space mentioned above in regards to Dempsey, albeit in a different way. I do want to see Gylfi start the next few matches.

Sandro seemed a bit of a non factor and that may have stemmed from the limited nature of THudd. Scotty P would be very nice to have come on as opposed to Livermore and impose some control on the match.

**Defense/CFCs assist machine**

Our defense was their attack. Simple as that. Walker is having an epic sophomore slump and ol' Bill can only do so much for us. We need to have BAE back, and Kaboul, but he's a ways out. On a positive note, Caulker has been quality and should start for us until he retires. Same goes for Jan. Give Naughton a start or two coming up. See if he can take Walker's spot. 

**GK**

Expect to see a whole lot more of Lloris.

AVB apparently is a halftime magician and is the right manager for us. We will continue to improve each week, as our injuries heal and the team gels. We could without a doubt use Moutinho in January as well as a striker. That would be a massive boost.

TL;DR:

We are Tottenham Hotspur, and this will be a great year for us. ",,False,self,t5_2ryq7,False,,flair3,True,t3_11uys8,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/11uys8/a_bit_of_hindsight_and_a_look_ahead/,

Disclaimer from the top: He knows NOTHING about whether or not bids have been made/hes never met Bale. 

But he spoke to me for a while about interesting considerations that the accounting department makes when participating in transfer discussions. They write transfer contingency reports for players and a key element of the memos written about Bale's potential transfer is the need for a full upfront payment, not one based on installments or debt from a Spanish bank, as the clubs accountants are wary about long term validity of any potential monetary loans from Spanish banks.

I thought this was a really interesting point especially given the recent debate about whether or not we would be better off with 80+ million pounds, or some type of player exchange or just keeping Bale. Maybe player exchanges are more attractive if we can't get the money all up front. Or maybe given theres SOME risk involved from taking so much money, we would be better off just keeping him (if Levy is considering selling, that is). I guess it just goes to show that not all money is treated equally from the clubs perspective and it definitely adds another element to the debate about whether or not we should sell.",,False,self,t5_2ryq7,False,,,True,t3_1jlitj,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1jlitj/possible_financing_considerations_for_bale/,

1360258412.0,45,self.coys,182p45,Changes in Spurs style under AVB from 'Arry,48,3,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/182p45/changes_in_spurs_style_under_avb_from_arry/,"Much has been expected of AVB and his changing of the way Spurs play this season. He's seen as much more of a tactician than 'Arry and we're told he prefers good possession based play with a high defensive line and pressing high up the pitch.

How much all of that has been true so far is certainly a discussion worth having at this point in the season. He did not institute a straight 4-3-3 formation and even reverted to a 4-4-2 formation fairly recently, but has set Spurs out most of the time in what could loosely and most easily be defined as a 4-2-3-1. 

For me, Spurs really play something closest to a 4-2-2-2. The back four has been the same throughout the season, the only variables being how far up the pitch one of the three players to see time at LB pushes up and how much the CB pairing is interested in carrying the ball forward into the midfield zone or sitting back and hitting long passes.

From there, there's been a fairly consistent two holding players shielding the back four, two wide players and finally the two most advanced, central players. When they play with Dempsey and Defoe they're very much playing with two strikers, when we've seen Sigurdsson out there he's shown more of a willingness to drop back from the opposition backline and participate in the build-up. Adebayor has also done this to a lesser degree too.

In short, we have not seen a 4-3-3 with Bale and Lennon pressing opposition fullbacks high up the pitch but we have also not seen Spurs revert to two banks of four when defending either, it's usually something in between these two extremes. The backline has definitely played higher than under 'Arry and the midfield seems to work harder pressing the ball than under our old manager.

Attack wise, have things looked all that different? Spurs still look their best when Lennon or Bale have the ball out wide in space, the fullbacks still motor forward and look to help the build-up too. It's possibly the midfield that has suffered when Spurs have possession without the creative duo of Modric and Parker. Dembele is not Modric, but his willingness to dribble through the center of pitch, get forward and provide slick passing has replaced Modric's presence but in a completely different style. If that makes sense.

VDV's style of play, however, has not been replaced. Sigurdsson is not VDV but he could be that player if he's given the time to play and develop into it, which he has not. Dempsey is not and will never be that type of dynamic play maker and for all of Dempsey's hardwork, it is not in the same manner of VDV who showed much more willingness to drop into midfield zones and help keep possession while also being able to link play to the striker(s) and get in goal scoring situations for himself.

I thought it might be interesting to look at a fixture from this season and compare to the corresponding fixture from last season. I chose Spurs vs Swansea from the first half of this season and Spurs vs Swansea from the second half of last season. There was only one transfer window between the two meetings and Swans were a solid team last season and this one and played in a similar style in both seasons.

Tottenham won both games, 1-0 this season and 3-1 last season, but dominated the game in terms of chances created in both instances.

Let's look at the stats from both games:
December 16th:
Shots: 29 Goals: 1 Passes: 476 attempted 89% completed Possession: 49.9% Crosses: 6/21 successful 
April 1st:
Shots: 20 Goals: 3 Passes: 404 attempted 86% completed Possession: 40.7% Crosses: 11/27 successful

Spurs created plenty of chances in both matches, where as Swans created very little(not shown above). But Tottenham cut down on the number of crosses, increased their number of passes, upped their completion percentage and most drastically, upped their possession from 40.7% to 49.9%. That sounds about what we would expect from the switch in managers. The biggest difference however? Three goals scored in April, one in December.

Should mention here, Bale did not feature in the December match.

Below are some links to Stats Zone graphs from the two matches:
http://tf-chalkboards.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/0h9Tp.png

This shows Spurs' interceptions from both matches. It seems to be the opposite of what we would expect, no? In the April fixture most of Spurs interceptions are around the center circle whereas the December fixture sees Tottenham intercepting passes deeper in their own territory.

http://tf-chalkboards.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/0hGgr.png

This shows chances created by Spurs in both matches. Here we see what we would probably expect. Spurs created more chances in the December fixture and the bulk of them came from central positions, back in April they created less and most of the chances came from longer passes from wide positions.

http://tf-chalkboards.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/0hg7k.png

All of Spurs passes between the two fixtures. Not much visually to glean here, but I noticed a heavier concentration of passes further up the pitch in the December fixture, including less passes to the flanks in their own half. So not only more passes and more possession but perhaps better possession further up the pitch?

http://tf-chalkboards.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/0hLhn.png

A simple one with a simple conclusion. Lloris' passes compared to Brad's. More passes over shorter distances with better success for our new number one. What's less clear is this more a factor of a change in manager or a change in keeper? Of course, the manager in question brought in the keepers in question anyways.

http://tf-chalkboards.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/0hGqk.png

Spurs long passes from both matches. Not too drastic a difference. Still a close number of long balls played and still a relatively high lack of success with those passes.

Lot here to digest and we are looking at only one match but that being said, thoughts?

Also, after having a look on /r/gunners (checking out the competition as you do..) every 10th post there is about Spurs!

Reminds me of :

&gt; It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low. And we of Spurs have set our sights very high... so high, in fact, that even failure will have in it an echo of glory.

Not only that, but he's being benched for a player who is physically very similar to Ade. Defoe and Ade have been wonderful together, in the short amount of time when they've actually been paired. I understand that Ade and Saha were absolutely lights out against Newcastle, but one game isn't enough. Yes, I love Ade, and yes, I like Saha, and yes, they've both been playing well, but Defoe needs his chances too!

I love my team.

I am Australian, and my father was English.
As a boy I followed different teams. My first jersey had Cantona on the back. I remember playing for the under 10's at my local club and strutting our onto the training pitch, proud to be a Man U supporter because hey, they were always winning and I loved that about them. Growing older I lost interest, boys get bored when their team wins all the time.

My next team was 'pool, my mates supported them and Stevie G was pretty much my idol. But like Man U my interest soon faded.

Dad was always a yid, but let me find my own way as far as team selection, he enjoyed the rivalry and encouraged me to find 'my team'.

In 2007 when I was 20 my father passed away. What was previously a trivial choice became a meaningful and somewhat easy decision. 

I now support Tottenham not just for myself, but for my Dad as well. No matter the circumstance, I watch every game. It's my own tradition, one I share with myself and the memory of my father. I hope to pass this tradition on to my children, and hope they see the importance this club has to the memory of their grandfather and to our family.

COME ON YOU SPURS. I love my team.


I'd love to hear why you follow this beautiful club, and any stories you might have.
And if you don't have a story, fuck it, the only thing that matters is support for our club! COYS!",,False,self,t5_2ryq7,False,,,True,t3_136jxe,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/136jxe/i_love_my_team/,

What does everyone think of our most recent acquisition?  I know that the majority of people on here were excited about him coming, which makes sense because he's proven to be a bright player, and everyone usually just loves the thought of a new signing in general.

I personally think that he has been a bit out of play because he has been overambitious in his play.  At times I have noticed that he could make a nice simple pass that wouldn't immediately impact the play, but instead he goes for a pass that has much much lower chances of being successful, with a higher and more immediate reward.  While I do think that he appears to be a very bright player (to the extent that it seems like he hasn't yet to build a very good understanding with the other players on the pitch at the time- something that will come with time), that he is a bit overeager to prove his ability and intelligence.  I enjoy his drive and the fact that he appears to be an aggressive player who won't back down, but it also has resulted in his receiving cards that were quite unnecessary.  I hope that he slows himself down a bit and becomes more composed on the pitch, something that will be much more likely once he has more than a few months with the club.",,False,self,t5_2ryq7,False,,num30,True,t3_1bfif9,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1bfif9/holtby/,

Firstly he clearly has absolutely no problem with sacking someone where he feels that can take the club no further and I think on both occasions he was right. I loved Jol as I'm sure everyone else did. However, our defense was bad under him and although the we'll score more than you attitude was exciting it did put a cap on our capabilities and I think you can see it now with Fulham too. I think also with Redknapp we have between the 4-6 best squad in the league and he continuously help us to achieve a fitting position. However, look at his tactics at QPR it is the exact same as spurs. One upfront, A skillful 10 behind two wingers and holding and ball playing midfielder and if it all goes wrong you've always got 4-4-2. He wasn't a genius he wasn't going to perform miracles.


Furthermore he clearly like the continental style Look at Ramos and even before that Santini and now AVB. His ideal is a young manager, a DOF and a philosophy of bringing in youth, buying low, selling high. A project. AVB is all a part of Levy's project. Redknapp was never going to utilise the new training facilities he constantly loaned out our youth and they never really got a look in, he'd sooner sign a 33 year old experienced player than give a young player a chance.

Finally I think Levy is constantly looking to raise the profile of the club. Tottenham are a business and Levy runs us like one, anyone who thinks that's a bad thing is a moron as our success is what the business thrives on so that is obviously  Levy's priority. He is a genius, he gave us Under armour and we're their first foothold into the footballing market so we're their poster boys and we therefore gets loads of free publicity, he takes us to america, he gets us a big name manager who player like Mourtinho describes as one of the best coaches in the world and most importantly he is getting us a new stadium

What Levy is setting up at spurs is a stable foundation that will keep Tottenham near the top of the footballing league for decades to come and more short term he has realised we cannot beat any of the other big  clubs at their own game of spending big on the best so instead we have to be innovative and go for a completely different method of development.

However, let's try and look at the bright side.

* 2-0 down to 2-2 in a matter of minutes, this is a new Tottenham, one that does not simply lie down.
* They are meant to be the best team in the league, they needed some very favourable decisions and a great bit of luck to get those three points today against our boys.
* We're still third. Solidly third. So many people would be shocked if we don't get Champions' League next season with how good we're looking now.
* We're against Watford next, then Wigan. Let's pull ourselves up and get soldiering on in that FA Cup and with the Premiership. It's only January and plenty to play for! I would be delighted with third and a trophy.

God, today broke my heart. Really, I've never felt so down after a match. But in retrospect, I'm proud of our boys. As I say, let's soldier on and keep our heads down. We're still odds-on to be Kings of London, if not even better than that.

The goal of any academy is to produce premier-league quality players, and in the last decade we haven't been doing too well - only Jamie O'Hara has come through, and even he started at Arsenal. 

Yet now we can claim to have the best academy in the country. As well as the success of our under-21s which includes some very exciting individuals (Pritchard, Parrett, Coulibaly, Coulthirst etc.), we now have four proven premiership quality players who have come through (Rose, Townsend, Caulker, Livermore) and a host of others (Carroll, Smith, Dawkins, Lancaster) knocking on the door. 

I don't think any other team in the country has such a wealth of young talent as we do, and even if they don't break into the first team - we can expect to make some healthy profits from our youth set up for some time to come! Levy, Sherwood, Inglethorpe (even though he's now at Liverpool) and all the guys at the academy need a huge well done for their efforts.

This is an opportunity to show our character, both the players and the fans. When we beat Man U at Old Trafford, no one was doom and gloom. Their players did not give up, and their fans, while obnoxious, knew they would return to winning next week.  Now its Spurs turn to show the maturity of a team that knows it is better than that. It is also our turn to do the same.

Secondly, this takes a lot of the pressure off.  Bale did not score, but Super Jan did so twice. Our team worked together, and despite what  is being said, we showed we are not a one man team.  We no longer have a streak to protect, and that should allow for a more loose, confident style of play like we had earlier this his year. 

Lastly, Liverpool did not beat us, we beat ourselves, and you better believe that is the last time we give up a penalty in the final minutes of a game. If we have learned one thing from the way ABV coaches, its that he will correct this and have us back to our winning ways.

I'm getting tired of all the talk about Bale leaving on this subreddit. 9 of the last 12 threads posted here are about Bale, and it's been that way for the past couple of weeks (I do understand that some of these are jokes, and that's ok).  It seems every news outlet is jumping on this ""Bale to Madrid"" bandwagon just to get page views on their websites, and I'm sick of seeing so many of these baseless rumors being perpetuated by our own fans. It's even more disheartening to see so many of you saying you're ""giving up on Bale"" as if he's already on a flight to Spain.

As far as we know: 
He's happy at the club. At the end of last season he just said he's enjoying his football and he's ready to get us back into the Champions League next season.
AVB said Levy gave his word that we're keeping Bale this summer. 
Paulinho said he chose Spurs partly because he was promised Bale would be here.

It's as simple as this: We miss out on Champions League this season, and Bale probably leaves next summer. Make top 4 and he could stay with us for a while. Until we get some quotes from the man himself, there's no reason to believe otherwise.  

tl;dr save the baseless rumors from Marca for /r/soccer

Hugo Lloris beginning to reap reward for remaining patient

http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/premierleague/article3637676.ece

The obvious question to ask Hugo Lloris is whether he feared he had done the wrong thing. There is contentment now, but for a time there was concern as, having taken a leap of faith in moving to a strange country, he was living in a hotel, away from his family, while facing up to an unexpected challenge to establish himself as the No 1 goalkeeper at Tottenham Hotspur.

Having completed his £12 million move from Lyons in the final hours before the August 31 transfer deadline and then departed to join up with the France national team, Lloris had been a Tottenham player for 12 days before he even trained with this new team-mates, including Brad Friedel, who was not going to give up his place easily. By the end of October he had played only six times — just once in the Barclays Premier League — and been on the winning side once. In his second Premier League match, in the North London derby against Arsenal on November 17, he let in five goals.

It did not help that Didier Deschamps, the France coach, suggested that Lloris, his captain, had made a bad career move and that the situation seemed “incomprehensible”. Looking back, it probably felt that way for Lloris at the time, particularly when people such as Deschamps were telling him so, but he can reflect on it more lucidly now, aware that his gradual integration into the team by André Villas-Boas might ultimately have helped him, both on and off the pitch, even if it did not feel that way at that time.

“You need mental strength when you are involved in high-level sport,” Lloris says on a sofa at Tottenham’s plush new training ground. “These are situations you have to cope with. You have to keep positive. It’s true that I didn’t play in the Premier League, but I was playing in the Europa League so I had to focus on that and on doing my job.

“I was in a hotel for a month, but then I was able to find a house and bring my family over. So when we talk about adapting to a new country, having your family around you is part of this because it gives you balance in your life.

“It isn’t great spending a month in a hotel but you put up with it. Then the people who work at the club helped me find a house and I’m very grateful to them for that.

“I had to be patient, but I wanted to play and to claim the goalkeeping position as mine.

“But the manager makes his own decisions, even though it wasn’t really what I expected. But it is part of an experience. The important thing was to come out the other side feeling stronger.”

What did Lloris say in his discussions with Villas-Boas at the time? “If anyone is going to speak about that, it should be the manager,” he replied. “I did speak to him, but what was said between us remains between the two of us unless he wants to speak about it. I’m a player and I know my place. The most important thing is that the situation has changed.”

It makes you wonder, though. For a goalkeeper, more than any other player, a sense of security is vital. Lloris is known for a level-headed approach, but he seemed a little less assured in some of those early matches; the 5-2 defeat by Arsenal was not his fault, but errors in earlier outings against Norwich City, in the Capital One Cup, and Maribor, in the Europa League, seemed to suggest that he was either short of confidence or perhaps a little too anxious to stake his claim.

“When you are on the pitch, you give everything you have to give and try to make as few mistakes as possible,” Lloris said. “But when the situation is not very clear, doubts may well begin to creep in. That is something you have to avoid. You have to focus on your own game. The best way to help the team is to concentrate on your own work.”

The conversation moves to David De Gea — naturally, given that Manchester United tracked Lloris for two years before switching their attention to the Spaniard, at 22 three years his junior, who has not yet had the chance to develop continuity or consistency at Old Trafford.

“It’s difficult for me to judge,” Lloris says. “I am here at Tottenham and he is in Manchester. Each time has its own issues, so we have to concentrate on ourselves. But it hasn’t stopped them [United] being top of the league with a few more points than the rest. He is a great keeper. He is very young and has a lot to learn and prove, but he certainly has everything he needs to be a success.”

If we are talking about goalkeeping virtues, Lloris is all about speed — of reflexes, of anticipation and of movement around the penalty area — making him an appropriate choice, perhaps, to promote the Need For Speed: Most Wanted video game.

“Being a keeper isn’t just about being a player,” he says. “It’s about a mindset, being rigorous in your work, brave. I don’t like to wait for the game to come to me, to have it imposed on me. I like to attack the ball, to play quite high up the pitch and to close the attacking players down where possible.”

Attacking the ball will involve different challenges tomorrow, when Lloris and Tottenham come up against the powerful penalty-box presence of Stoke City, but he seems undaunted by the prospect.

“Football is universal,” he says. “There are certain characteristics, such as crosses, high balls, duels on the pitch and fighting spirit [he uses the English term] which are part of English football. Here it is faster, with higher intensity.”

Lloris was speaking before yesterday’s Europa League draw, which set up a reunion with Lyons, his former club. He talks fondly of his time there. “I needed to move on to the next stage in my career,” he says. “Coming to Tottenham was a great opportunity for me. During my time at Lyons I developed as a man and a sportsman into what I am today.”

As a sportsman, Lloris is close to the top of his profession. As a man, he is intelligent, articulate, well-mannered. His has not been the typical footballer upbringing. His father, Luc, is a banker in Monte Carlo and his mother, Marie, was a lawyer who died from cancer four years ago. “When you have experienced this sort of difficult situation,” he says, “it is easier to take a step back and put things in the right context, such as what happened when I first arrived here.

“There are more important things in life, such as one’s family. It is all part of life.

“Every player has his own story. Things are going well for me. I have my wife and my daughter, who is 2½. My family here is now. I am happy — both professionally and personally.” ",,False,self,t5_2ryq7,False,,,True,t3_157wrp,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/157wrp/brilliant_interview_with_lloris_in_the_times_today/,

Would love to hear whether /r/coys just thinks I'm deluded and ridiculously optimistic, or whether I've got a point. Submitting as self-post and copy and pasting the article below because this isn't for karma or hits.
-----------------------------------------

Finishing 5th is a detail. An incredibly demoralising detail, a detail that mean Spurs miss out on the obvious benefits of Champions League qualification, a detail that could so easily have been different, but still, just a detail. 

72 points, a record for Tottenham in the Premier League, is the statistic of true importance. And it's a statistic that fills me with optimism. 

If, for AVB, this season was about proving he was still the prodigious manager that led Porto to their record-breaking 2010/11 season and that he was more a victim, than a creator, of circumstances in his time at Chelsea, then he did that. In fact, one of his great achievements this season was in overcoming the xenophobic, agenda-driven media image that had once threatened to destroy his career as a manager in England. 

His first season at Tottenham was ultimately one of transition. Transition to an era where methodology, tactics, training sessions, science and consistent transfer policy are more than just words the manager can't spell. AVB lost key players early on (King, Modric, VdV), didn't have a new striker signed until August 23rd, allegedly didn't sign his key transfer target (Moutinho) or another striker, had to integrate several new signings in a very short time, lost Kaboul to injury for the full season, had to juggled two keepers expecting first team football for a couple of months, lost Sandro to injury mid-season and had to adapt to managing a new football club...

...yet still achieved a record points tally. 

Upon joining Spurs he spoke of their ""high ambitions towards the future"" and his ""mission to put Tottenham back on track with titles"". Many claimed it was empty rhetoric at the time but this season has gone a long way to proving that it wasn't. And I firmly believe that next season will prove this beyond all doubt, in the only way such a statement can be. With titles.

A full pre-season, as oppose to one where many of the starters are not in his plans for the season, will allow AVB to implement his ideas with plenty of time and without the hinderance of needing to use makeshift players in his system. Sandro was crucial to Spurs' strong run of results until his injury, his return along with Kaboul's will add serious quality to the starting XI and useful depth to the squad. These two returning will feel like new signings- Tottenham will start next season with a significantly better team before any action in the transfer market. 

A spine of Lloris | Vertonghen-Kaboul | Dembele-Sandro would rival any team in the Premiership. In Lloris, a World Class keeper, in Vertonghen-Kaboul, two modern centre-backs whose style of play should work well together, in Dembele-Sandro, a midfield pivot that can create and destroy in equal measure. This spine of the team being fit for the season would make a dramatic difference, Tottenham would automatically become a harder to beat team and a more consistent team. And don't especially underestimate the effect of having Lloris in goal for all 38 games.

Although not being in the Champions League is far from ideal, it is nothing like the catastrophe so many are suggesting. In the transfer window of 2010/11 when Spurs were in the competition, Daniel Levy showed no changes in his propensity to spend. Last Summer, when Spurs weren't in the competition, they were able to attract players of Lloris', Vertonghen's and Dembeles' quality. Said players signed because they believed in the project that was beginning at White Hart Lane, not because Tottenham had Champions League football. This is another reason I believe Levy will back AVB in the coming transfer window in signing his targets (striker, full back, midfielder); if the club were to rest on its laurels such players would inevitably draw attention from other clubs. 

And then there is Gareth Bale , who will no doubt be useful in attracting new players. I'm sure he'll stay another season (at least) probably signing a new £130k contract in the process. He is World Class, and deserves to move onto a bigger fish at some point in his career if he so wishes, but he is also pragmatic. He knows that AVB suggesting he try a new position in pre-season was crucial to his success this season, he knows that Tottenham have this exciting squad that is going places and above all, he knows that he is the main man here and that the team is being built around him. At 23 years of age and with a 1 year old child, emigrating to Madrid might not seem like the most attractive option- the time will come.    

 Last season the first few fixtures were write-offs as the squad was still lacking in key areas; this season a strong start will be possible. Early season success breeds belief breeds results breeds belief... you get the picture. A good start is something Tottenham haven't had for a good few seasons, it will plant the belief that they can do better than 4th. If AVB hasn't already planted it.

But maintaining results is as much about the starting XI as it is about the squad. In Townsend, Smith and Rose AVB has three players who might immediately be able to contribute something to the squad where they couldn't last season, whilst Holtby, Sandro and Kaboul being around for the full season will of course make a huge difference. Add to that emerging players like Carroll and Caulker, who, having picked up valuable first team experience this season, will be able to mount a proper challenge towards a starting place next season. The result is that next season Tottenham will have squad stronger than that of last year even before any transfer activity. Carroll particularly is someone who I expect to start gaining the attention he deserves next season and really contribute towards Tottenham's title challenge, he is a fantastic prospect and Spurs' homegrown answer to the Luka Modric sized gap in midfield. 

Above all, there exists within the Tottenham team the necessary mentality to win a title. There is great harmony within the squad, the players admire the coach and the team never seem to give up. No matter the money that the Chelsea and Man Citys of this World spend, they can only field 11 players, and as Tottenham proved by being one of two teams to beat Man United at Old Trafford, on their day they can give anyone a game. 

With a bit luck, that is, not picking up key injuries, getting given the odd penalty (not a single one last season) and shots going in rather than hitting the post (if all shots that had hit the post by every team had gone in, Spurs would've finished 3rd) then a title challenge is certainly within the realms of possibility. 

Theoretically speaking  if Spurs were to amass an extra 12-15 points next season, that would leave them around about on the lower end of what is usually necessary to win the Premier League. A total that is certainly attainable considering all the aforementioned factors.

No-one expected AVB's Porto to destroy everything in their path as they did during that incredible season. No-one expects AVB's Tottenham to do it next season, but I see all the factors in place for the realistic equivalent of such a season. The team grew and improved from last season when many expected them to stagnate, I can see that happening again. Winning the Premier League should be the objective, Champions League football a happy consequence. 

Why this year in particular, you ask? Why not in a couple of years when AVB has had yet more time? The answer is simple; because why not? All the factors in place, just no one has really noticed yet.

COYS.

1349183970.0,36,self.coys,10tbyv,"So, about this Dempsey fellow... (and a hearty welcome to new Yiddos)",41,5,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/10tbyv/so_about_this_dempsey_fellow_and_a_hearty_welcome/,"First off, the August 31 addition of Clint Dempsey to the Tottenham roster did four things:

* It bolstered our strike force (particularly in the AM position)
* It denied Liverpool access to the greatest American outfield player alive
* It brought Spurs to the attention of thousands of Americans (my local soccer bar was packed with new Spurs fans on Saturday morning)
* It set **a single-day subscription record for /r/coys**

That's right, /r/coys normally picks up around 4 new subscribers a day. On August 31, after the Dempsey signing, we acquired **28**. 

(We also picked up **3,138** unique visitors and **44,955** pageviews. All of which are single-day records for /r/coys)

A solid 1.5% of all of our legion came into being on August 31.

If you add in September 1 (where we acquired **19** new subscribers), the 'Dempsey Bounce' now accounts for 2.5% of all of our Yids.

(*Note:* Although Hugo Lloris was signed on the same day, I am estimating the /r/coys impact of the Lloris signing to be minimal - mainly due to the fact that his signing was known well in advance, and the paucity of French football supporters on here)

**So, to the Dempsey Generation of /r/coys, welcome, and please, stick around a while, we're delighted to have you**.
