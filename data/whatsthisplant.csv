r/whatsthisplant is doing quite well. Almost all plants that get submitted get ID'ed or at least an attempt at an ID. There's been little drama and the community is steadily growing. I encourage all submitters to tell their friends and family, help spread the word. We want more Plant IDers as well as plants to ID!

I'd like to revive the idea of adding a most-common link to the sidebar. We still receive a lot of ID requests for common plants that are easily IDed. Right now it may not be an issue, but if the subreddit continues to grow, these posts can push down some of the harder to ID requests. If there's no major objection, I'd like to get a page going with a picture of the plant, common name, botanical name, as well as a link to a plant profile site. 

I want to draw attention to upvoting of posts as well. I've noticed the plants that are interesting/pretty get upvoted the most, while less pretty (yet often harder to ID) plants are left without votes. I'd like to request that people upvote posts that they can't ID. It helps boost these ones to the top, giving them more visibility and a more likely chance at being IDed before they disappear.

Apart from those few things, everything is going smoothly. If anyone has any ideas, suggestions, thoughts, opinions or complaints to air, please feel free.

So we're midway through 2012 and the subscriptions are starting to accelerate. We're also starting to get many more posts per day than we were a few months back. As a result, I believe we're coming close to the point where a lot of ID requests will go unanswered as posts will start swamping each other. 

I encourage everyone to browse the 'new' tab to ensure they're checking all ID requests.

The Unresolved ID list is currently still empty, none of us have really had the time to go through and find unresolved IDs, nor to add them to the list. I'm considering simply removing it for now and encouraging unresolved IDs to be submitted again later for another go. Thoughts?

I would also like to add a ""common plants"" post to the sidebar to answer a few common IDs we get here pretty much year around. Poison Ivy is the main one that comes to mind. Any other plants that might belong in this list?

Not being able to downvote people that are clearly wrong can lead to some problems.  For instance, if someone posts a picture of Rhus aromatica and the first person says poison ivy, 2 other people not well informed upvote, then someone else posts the correct ID, we have 3/1 votes for an incorrect ID.  

I see lots of people throw out ID's on this subreddit, /r/whatsthisbug and /r/spiders that are way off, and if the first answer a user not subscribed to this subreddit gets is wrong and gets 3 upvotes, they may never check back and see the correct answer, they will just think, well 3 experts said this is correct.

This is not always harmful but in the case of the large number of people posting pictures of plants they find in their garden asking if they can eat it a poisonous look alike or in some cases I've seen, a look nothing alike could be ID'd as non-poisonous.

Hi IDits. How ya goin'?

Just a little announcement on how the subreddit is doing, what we can expect for the future, and a chance to have your voice/ideas heard.

**Firstly**, we've seen a small drop in traffic over August and into September, mostly because it's heading out of the flowering time in most Northern Hemisphere countries. And us Southies just don't make up the numbers to fill in the gaps!

Then on the 16th of September (last Sunday) we suddenly saw over 1,000 new subscribers to r/whatsthisplant, resulting in over 16,000 pagehits for the day (up from 1,000 on the Saturday.) I have no idea where the traffic came from. I can only assume we got a mention in a newspaper or on a radio station somewhere, since I can't find anything on google. Anyone know the story?

**Secondly**, It's starting to look like having a list of common ID requests would be a sound idea for the subreddit, as we get a *lot* of the same plant popping up time and time again. Not so much an issue now, but if the community continues to grow, these IDs take up space for other IDs that could go unanswered. If there's enough favour, I'll start a thread requesting which plants should go on the list, and we can make a top 10 or so which people will be encouraged to browse before submitting.

**Thirdly**, I would like opinions on whether or not we should continue to allow fungus IDs in this subreddit, or should a separate subreddit be created? Fungi are not plants, however they're starting to pop up in here quite commonly as ID requests. I honestly don't know which way we should go with this one.

**Lastly**, unfortunately I think we have to remove the Unresolved ID section. Nobody really has the time or commitment to update and monitor the list, so in lieu of someone stepping up, I think it's better if people just resubmit IDs that go unanswered.

So there we go. Keep up the good work, keep posting interesting finds. Any comments, complaints or ideas are more than welcome!",,False,self,t5_2si8i,False,,,True,t3_10c9zn,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisplant/comments/10c9zn/state_of_the_subreddit_q4_2012/,

(Please upvote this post),58,7,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisplant/comments/thl8b/new_unresolved_plant_id_list_added_to_sidebar/,"**Please upvote this post. It's a selfpost so I don't get karma from it, just want to keep it at the top of the page so people see it.**

We've added a link to a list of unresolved Plant ID requests to the sidebar, which can be found under the guidelines. Hopefully this will help close out some older cases which are still unsolved.

General rules for the list:  

* If a post is over 7 days days old and doesn't have a resolved plant ID, the submitter or any other community member may nominate it for the Unresolved list.
* All unresolved list requests should be messaged to the moderators.
* **The moderators have the final say on whether or not a request is added to the list.** I see no reason why we'd reject any requests, however for arguments sake, the moderators will make the final decision, no arguments. 
* If you believe you can ID one of the plants in the list, please *don't* reply to the thread, instead message the moderators with your ID along with the link to the original post so we can mark it as closed. 

This is all a temporary system to see how it plays out for now. It may end up being too much work to keep running. In the future, it will probably be easier to set up a separate subreddit to deal with unresolved cases.

**How you can help for now**  

* The thing we need most is any and all unresolved ID cases. If you have some spare time, please look back at older threads and find as many unresolved cases as you can so they can be added to the list. 
* Please message me (Orichalcon) the links so I can add them to the list. Please **do not message all moderators** the links. This is to keep the clutter down in our inboxes. :)
* Lastly, if you have any suggestions or ideas on how to improve this system, please post them here! This is in its infancy and can definitely be improved upon.",,False,self,t5_2si8i,False,,,True,t3_thl8b,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisplant/comments/thl8b/new_unresolved_plant_id_list_added_to_sidebar/,

I didn't catch the name of who shared the script and instructions to us, so thankyou unidentified individual! Hopefully Youmati can share.

**Instructions**: Fairly straightforward. Underneath your post you'll see a line of words including ""comments, share, hide, remove"" etc. There is one there called ""flair"" now as well. Simply click this link and you'll get a box that allows you to select premade flair that the mods have added. For now the only one available is ""Identified"". Simply click this one, then click ""save"" to mark your post as identified.

We've decided to end the trial early of the downvote-button removal since it clearly wasn't working and was heavily opposed.

That said, I'd like our readers to consider two things when posting and downvoting in this subreddit.

1) Please try and comment as much as possible when upvoting and downvoting comments. The major opposition to the trial was the inability to downvote incorrect IDs. I agree we need a way to show IDs as incorrect, so continue to downvote them as you were, but consider adding a comment as to your reasoning as well. There's an opportunity there to educate people on right and wrong IDs, and commenting can help people understand why their IDs were wrong, instead of silently being downvoted and wondering why.

2) *Please* don't downvote new ID requests unless you have a good reason to. If you *do* downvote a new ID request, please post a comment as to *why* you're downvoting the post. 

The downvote button will stay, but keep these in consideration. Essentially the more comments and communication we have going, the better the subreddit will be.",,False,self,t5_2si8i,1375765961.0,,,True,t3_1jsj7q,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisplant/comments/1jsj7q/downvote_button_returned_please_read/,

That's why I think it would help to link to the [ASPCA list of toxic and non-toxic plants](http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/poison-control/plants/). It is not complete, and I question the toxicity of some of the plants listed, but it's the best toxicity resource I've found so far.

I was just hoping it was a common ornamental plant that may be easy to ID anyway?

But we had a flock of cedar waxwings fly into this tree and then proceed to drop dead out of it--a total of 6. So if it is indeed the berries from this tree that killed them, then myself and my animal control folks are interested as to what it is (just out of curiosity--I mean, what the hell waxwings don't you eat berries for a living?).

It's also possible they were poisoned elsewhere and flocked into the tree before dying. :\ 

This is in Washington, DC. Thanks for any help you can offer!

It stings like crazy! I've stepped on it before, and it stings like an electric shock for a long time. It throbs and comes and goes.
I have no idea what it is. I tried to get decent pictures, but it's a bit windy and I didn't want to touch it to steady it! My son and hubby already got stung by it today.

Any ideas??

Anyway, I received [this mixed-plant thingy](http://imgur.com/j88wt) a few weeks ago, and it seems as if everything in it has different requirements. Why do they combine mixed-needs plants like this? I think they're just in it for the money.

The ferny thing has already lost a lot of leaves, the purple thing isn't looking so hot at all, the moss is starting to turn brown, and the succulent-ish piece is a-OK.

It lives on my desk at work. I mist it with water every day. I went on vacation for a week, and that's where I think the major damage occurred. Should I keep misting it every day? Not so much or more? What are each of the plants called? 

Thanks guys!

I'm from Connecticut. I was cleaning out my garden this afternoon in preparation for planting and found a large number of stalks sticking up that were dried up and broke easily. I cleared them out, but when I went to try and remove some of the root system it wouldn't budge. I dug around each one and started pulling out huge chunks of still alive plant, some chunks bigger than my hand/arm. 

The chunks break pretty easily, especially when I hit them with the shovel, but I could break them by hand with little effort. I included a cross section of one if that helps at all. There was a weed growing above some of these roots that seemed to be connected to the system but I wasn't sure. I included a picture of that as well in case it helps. 

What the heck is this thing? The garden I was working on clearing out is going to be a vegetable garden. Should I be worried about this thing hurting my vegetables?

Edit: I'm almost positive now that it is pokeweed that grew quite large over a few years. Thanks for the help everyone!",Identified ,False,self,t5_2si8i,1366250101.0,resolved,,True,t3_1cff99,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisplant/comments/1cff99/found_this_while_cleaning_out_my_garden/,

The first image is not particularly helpful, but the things of note are the morphology of the branches (each large branch has a few large forks, and multiple small branchlets coming off in a regular pattern - the whole thing forms a fairly flat palm-tree like shape).  

Secondly, the branches have a really interesting bark-like covering that almost has the cross-section of a cactus (star-shaped).  The bark is unusually thick on these smaller branches, but looks much less so on the main trunk.

If anyone can ID this tree from the scant information I've shown in the images that would be great.  I'll keep track of it as we progress into spring and maybe post again once it has foliage, if this isn't fruitful.

The trees are growing in a cluster on some public land.  This is on the west coast of Canada (where we can grow plants form many climate zones).  Wet, cool winters and dry moderate summers.

These are probably fairly common plants for new houses in the area, but as the title says I'm new to anything plant related. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
