Pics first because attention span etc etc.

-------------------------------------------------------

I wanted to share with you guys where fitness has brought me over the last half year or so. I know a lot of girls are scared of heavy lifting, and I wanted to share my experience because it's been the best thing for my health, self esteem and aesthetics and it's now not just my passion, but part of my life. 

I started getting into fitness the summer of 2012. I started off with typical 'girl' things like yoga, cardio etc. and I wasn't getting results. I lost a bit of weight, but that was mainly through diet. I started doing some research, reading r/fitness and decided to try out strength training. 

When I first put a barbell on my back to try to squat, it felt like the world was resting on my shoulders. It was ugly, but I kept at it. I started lifting once a week, then I started realizing that every time I went back, the weight that felt like the world last week, now felt manageable. I did some bastardized once a week version of 'starting stregnth', but I was still getting results. By the end of the summer I had dropped the excess weight that I had and decided to stop losing and start eating to gain muscle. Eventually I got more and more comfortable and started lifting twice a week, then three times. 

By about november of 2012, I dedicated myself to strength training and dropped all the other 'crap'. My lifts kept flying up. By January, I started following the Texas Method program. 

----------------------------------------------------

My lifts went from: 

Squat: 65lbs - &gt; 185lbs 

Bench: 45lbs - &gt; 120lbs 

Deadlift: 65lbs - &gt; 225lbs 


My bodyweight went from 115 -&gt; 98lbs (my lowest) -&gt; 110lbs (now). 

I've been 5'2 this whole time. Wish that went up, but I'll take what I can get. 

--------------------------------------------------
Diet:

I forgot to add this in because I don't really follow much of one. I eat until I'm full and just get enough protein. The best thing I've learned in terms of diet is portion sizes and how to estimate calories. 

It comes out to about 1500 cals rest day, 2000 cals training days now. 
When I was first losing weight, I was eating closer to 1200-1500 cals a day. 

Supplementation: 

I swig fish oil. And use some whey. I'm not a huge fan of stims, but I'll take some caffeine if I'm tired. Keeping it simple for now. 

--------------------------------------------------
I've joined an olympic lifting team this month now following bulgarian methods and have switched my focus over from powerlifting, but it gave me the base strength and confidence I needed. I didn't turn into the hulk. I became strong.

**Please ladies, please. Even if you don't want to be a powerlifter, get strong. Squatting 3x a week isn't going to kill you.** For the record, neither is squatting 5x a week.

If I could tell you one thing, it's that consistency will be what determines whether you succeed or fail. Push hard, don't be afraid to fail the weight and just keep at it. 

Don't overcomplicate things. Don't try to get everything perfect before you get in the gym. Just lift. And then lift a little more. It's simple, but it's not easy.

Here's me at 210lb's in Oct 2008.  http://imgur.com/U9ej2
Overall  I was in pretty bad health.  Big drinker/smoker, high blood pressure, couldn't run a city block.  
Here's me at 152lb's after finishing IRONMAN Arizona http://imgur.com/oo3Bn

The last 4 years were in no way linear and Ironman was never the goal (until last year).  This was my progress...

* Jan 2009 Weight loss competition.  Diet: Modified 4hr body.  Routine:mostly cardio with some machine work.  I was working out in a clubhouse gym, so options were limited.  Went from 210-180lb in 3 months.  Quit smoking

* June 2009 Join a 24hr gym.  More resistance training, but a pretty BS routine.  Had some strength gains, but also some weight gain as I was still drinking beer daily (8+ easily). Switched from eliptical to treadmill running.  

* Feb 2010 First 5k.  33min
* March 2010: Join Lifetime Fitness.  Start Spinning 2-3 times/week.  Lifting 6 days week.
* Feb 2011 1st 1/2 Marathon  2:0X:XX
* May 2011  Find Fittit.  Stop BS'ing in the gym and start lifting. Dropped the curls, calf  raises...etc.., added squats, deadlifts, pullups...all the good stuff fittit has taught me. 
* Nov 2011  Sign up for IMAZ 2012.  Stop drinking during the week. 
* Dec 2011  Bought road bike 
* Feb 2012  First Marathon  3:5X:XX
* April 2012  First triathlon. 1/2 Ironman  5:3X:XX
* Nov 2012  Ironman Arizona 11:1X:XX

* Advice (for what it's worth)
* Find a diet with food you like.  I still eat chicken, eggs, and black beans every day.  
* Start doing the big compound lifts
* Interval training works
* You can be an Endurance Athlete on a low carb diet.  I did 75% of my IM training on less than 120 carbs/day.  
* Stopping drinking really takes off the pounds.  

A sincere thanks to you Fittit.  Couldn't have done it without you.

1361375932.0,2692,self.Fitness,18w30k,So I heard /r/Fitness liked Asian Transformations. My journey from 100lb twig to 200lbs of muscle.,4770,2078,668,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/18w30k/so_i_heard_rfitness_liked_asian_transformations/,"Hi Reddit! Before we get into the transformation I want to give this message to all those in the transformation process. Transforming yourself on the inside is as important if not more so than making the physical transformation. I'll get into this again later, but for me, my physical transformation was just a catalyst for my later inner transformation. And **it wasn't until I changed the way I perceived myself, the world, and life in general that my life REALLY change.** 

You can be the biggest/most ripped guy on the planet, but without a good inner base of confidence you will never feel complete/whole.

**My Transformation**

* I grew up as a skinny little kid. Didn't pass 100lbs until I was 15. Took weight lifting in High School but wasn't very serious about it. Put on a decent amount of muscle for a High Schooler but I was still skinny as hell. [Here's me at 18 in 2005, about 145-150lbs](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#0)

* Went to college and made getting big my NUMBER one goal. Didn't party, didn't socialize, didn't do sh*t but lift and read about lifting and playing MMOs(because I was very socially awkward, unconfident, and felt that if I could get big then I could get girls.) Put on about 20lbs that year, bench went from 205 to 255, didn't do a single squat that year hah. [Here's me at 175lbs in the Summer of 2006](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#1)

* From the fall of 2006 to the end of 2008 I took bulking VERY seriously, and I learned more about proper lifting. Primarily followed Madcow's 5x5 program and gained a ton of strength/size. Also gained a ton of fat as I was eating some ridiculous meals to put on size. A typical dinner for me consisted of at least 350g carbs and 16oz of meat. I seriously think I made myself insulin resistant to the point of being border-line type 2 diabetic in this period. At the end of that time I had terrible energy swings, would literally fall unconscious after large dinners. But I gained size! And fat... [Was 215 at the end of 2008](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#2)

* I started my cut in the Winter of 2008 and that lasted all the way until the fall of 2009. I tried EVERY diet. 40/40/20, velocity diet(where your only source of calories are from 5 protein shakes a day for 28 days- **terrible, never do this**), carb cycling, keto, high fat, low fat, high carb, low carb. You name it, I tried it. Settled on keto and carb cycling as the most effective for me. Dropped down to 187, lost quite a bit of strength, definitely lost some muscle mass(especially during velocity diet). [Here is me at the end of that cut, fall of 2009](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#4)

* Today I am a healthy 195. I've been at this weight for the last two years. This seems to be a good homeostasis point. I like the weight because I can be strong/big and yet still pretty athletic(I'm in the Army so I need to be able to run). [A shot of my legs in Sept 2012.](http://imgur.com/a/OwgIF#6) [Just for fun, here's a video I just uploaded of doing 102 reps of Squats with 225lbs in 29 minutes.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGUQXxUDxjE) I'm a firm believer that squats and deads are fundamental to developing a well-rounded physique. GO SQUAT!

* [A video I made of my transformation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pRDBtgdhoM)

* [Link to a more detailed write-up of my transformation](http://www.thehealthygamer.com/2013/02/12/the-transformation-of-a-nerdy-asian-gamer/)

Now let me talk about inner change. After I got ""ripped"" in 2009 I realized that life didn't change much. Sure I got more attention from people and girls, but I still felt unconfident. I still sucked with women. I still was shy and timid. **Note- I realize getting girls is not the sole purpose of life, but for someone in their 20's it is still a very important issue- especially if you CAN'T attract the kind of women you want to date, and that's why I keep hitting on that issue.**

That's when I really got serious with self development. Read a ton of books and worked on my inner being. A few examples of exercises I did- I would walk around and force myself to hold eye-contact with every person walking by me on campus(insanely difficult at first!). I consciously talked louder. I made myself aware of how my body language was at all times. Little things like that, which over time, really helped me to grow confident in myself.

Today I absolutely love life. I love it and I live it with zeal. I've been able to land great jobs because of my confidence and social skills developed over the last few years. I've started my own business that brings in about 1k a month after 8 months. I was able to do this because of the confidence I gained and the realization that anything is possible with disciplined hard work.

**So my message to all of you is that you can change EVERYTHING about yourself. You can change your appearance, and you can change your attitude toward life. You can change your limiting beliefs. You can change how people perceive you, and you can change how you perceive life.**

And just to put a little plug in, I have built a [website](http://www.thehealthygamer.com/) and [Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/HappyJacksChannel) that is dedicated to helping nerdy gamers become fit, active, and confident(because I grew up addicted to UO/EQ/WoW).

* [If you're into the whole facebook thing would love to get more like-minded folks active on the facebook page to share ideas/get new ideas/motivate each other.](https://www.facebook.com/thehealthygamerchannel)

My passion in life is helping others realize the potential hidden within them. We all have within us the seed of greatness. It is up to you to awaken and nurture that seed until it propels you into the life that you've always known you deserved. Go out there. Take action. Make it happen.

Feel free to ask me questions about training/fitness/nutrition/self development/confidence/women/motivation. I'm going to check this thread pretty regularly for the next week and answer all of them. And again guys, if you put hard work into it you can absolutely achieve anything in life.

**FAQ**

* What exercise regime did I follow? - I followed Madcow 5x5 for most of the period. I now do 5x3x1. I modify both of these by adding in extra sets of hypertrophy specific work at the end of the workout(3-5 sets of an exercise that compliments the major muscle groups worked that day with 10-15 reps). 

* What kind of diet do you recommend? - I have tried literally everything. Keto, 40/40/20, carb cycling, high carb, low carb, whole grain, no grain, 2g protein/lb, etc. From all of that I firmly believe that in order to have optimal body composition and optimal health we MUST eliminate or greatly reduce our consumption of processed carbohydrates. I follow a primal/paleo lifestyle now. I eat eggs, nuts, fruits, veggies, meats. I avoid breads, pastas, flours, legumes, dairy(lactose intolerant as an Asian anyways).

* To expand on the diet - I think Keto is very effective for losing fat, but can be hard to follow. What I do now is intermittent fasting and primal eating. This makes it almost effortless to maintain an 8-10% bodyfat and if I ever want to lose fat I simply lower my carb intake for two to three meals in the week.

* [The best book I've ever read on the subject of nutrition that's written in an accessible and easy to read fashion is Mark Sisson's Primal Blueprint](http://www.amazon.com/The-Primal-Blueprint-Reprogram-effortless/dp/0982207786/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361403480&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=primal+blueprint)

* The best way to gain weight IMO is to increase your sources of healthy fats and eat nutritious carbohydrates. Healthy fats: avocados, coconut oiil, olive oil, almonds, almond butter to name a few. Nutritious carbohydrates: sweet potatoes, fruits, veggies, plantanes, yucca roots.

* What kind of cardio did I do? I did a lot of steady state stuff. BUT today I do mostly high intensity interval cardio and circuit cardio. Examples of interval cardio: sprint for 60 seconds, walk for 90 seconds, repeat 5-6x. Example of cardio circuit: 20 pushups, 25 bodyweight squats, 6 pullups, 25 crunches, back to back with 30s rest before you do it again. Repeat 5-6x. This type of cardio imo is MUCH more efficient and actually better at helping you arrive at your fat loss/muscle building gains than doing steady state cardio(running/elliptical for half an hour or more.) - There is a study that showed participants who did 8 minutes of interval cardio where they exercised for 60s, rested for 30s, burned MORE calories than participants who did steady state cardio(hr of 150) for half an hour.

* How do you incorporate running with weight lifting? - I run two times a week, always after my leg days. My leg days are monday and friday so I will run either tuesday and saturday, or after the leg workout on Monday and Fridays just depending on what I feel like doing. Always give your legs at least 36 hours if not 48 hours of full rest before doing heavy leg days.

* What self-development books do I recommend? - ALL OF THEM. Megaliving and The Monk Who Sold his Ferrari by Robin Sharma are both really good. Tony Robbins has a bunch of good books, I've only read his Unlimited Power books however and it was pretty good. Jack Canfield(the author of all the chicken soup for the soul books) has some very nice books on finding success in life. Of course there's the cornerstone book of Think and Grow Rich which every self-development guru points to, and I have to say I found it to be a fantastic read. Code to Joy is a really interesting look at how early childhood traumas impact our present day emotions and actions.

* I also HIGHLY recommend audio books. To date Earl Nightengale's ""The Strangest Secret"" is still the most motivational thing I've ever heard, here's a link to the full thing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62DqsD2s5V8 Load up your MP3 player with audio books and listen to them EVERYWHERE you go. Between driving, the gym, and random housework where you don't have to really focus the average person can squeeze in 3+ hours of audio books a day. That adds up to a tremendous amount of knowledge gained over a period of years.

* **MEDITATION** Meditation is the ONE practice that lead me to be able to make every other inner change I've ever made. Without meditation I would not be the person I am. The real power in meditation is its ability to: center you, clear your thoughts, and give you that deep **knowing** that everything is okay, that no matter what happens you will be okay, and that life is wonderful. I highly recommend anyone who is interested in improving themselves to pick up the practice of meditating for at least 5 minutes each day. I meditate for 5 minutes in the morning, 20 min in the afternoon, and an additional 10 mins before I go to bed. It is very simple. I just focus on my breathing and bring my attention to the present. That's all you have to do.

* PHEW alright I think that covered most of the questions, if you have more ask away, I'm going to monitor this thread closely for the next week.

--------------------

I've been going to the same gym for 6 months now. I've seen the same guy there pretty much every time I work out (6am), he's usually happy/talking to the local gym goers. However, I haven't seen him in two weeks.  
  
Today was different though. I saw him today, I said hello like usual in the lockers, he threw a half hearted hello, completely blank face.  
  
We were out of the lockers and started warming up for deadlifts. Now, he's a pretty big dude, gym goer for 4 years now (he says). He's deadlifting 600 lbs for 3x5. We're doing our final set, and he loads two 25's on each side, 50lbs is huge to add to such an intense workout. He busts out 15 reps with such unreal intensity, by the 10th rep he had an insane pump going, and thats when the tears started breaking out and streaming down his face. He's grunting/yelling/making sounds (not too loud to disrupt the maybe...3 people in the gym at the time?) by the 10th rep. After the 15th he could barely get the bar up. When he was done he was a complete wreck. Very close to fainting, tears fully on streaming down his face. Red as a tomato, total rage, huffing and puffing. I asked him what was up, he replied in such a shaky/sobby voice: ""She took my kids, my money, my life."" And then proceeded to the lockers to wash up and leave.  
  
Just a story I thought I'd share.

First and foremost I just want to say THANK YOU to this community for rallying behind me throughout my journey. I am around 8.5 weeks out from my very first show (NPC San Jose) and while I know that there are girls coming in who have much more experience and muscle definition, I'm hoping to show up really conditioned and take pride in the package I'm presenting on stage. I'm presenting this on my cakeday because it truly is my passion and what I'm MOST proud of: lifting heavy and eating clean every day.

If you want to know how I did it check out my blog: http://ilyssagetsfit.blogspot.com . In the About Me section in the top right corner there is a link to a 9 page google doc I've written out to answer any of your questions. [Quick Link Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BRnqHfnj_QkBPDY9xWFpwbaPNKQOtqPt9wWQR-tZ-WM/edit)

**The most important thing for me to stress is that the reason I have gotten so lean, so quickly is because I do the big four movements with minor accessory isolation work to follow. I only do cardio 3 days a week, but I track every single macronutrient and calorie I take in (1900 cal a day even on this bikini cut). My deadlift has gone up to 225 pounds (though I'm positive I could pull more but don't train 1 rep maxes--I pulled 185 x 12 two weeks ago). I can squat my body weight and I'm pushing 95-100 pounds in my bench. I pick up iron and put it down. I'm not interested in machines that stabilize the weight for you. I'm not interested in ""bodypump"" classes that ""teach"" you how to incorporate weights into your routine. I lift heavy, every damn day, and have an amazing powerlifting team at San Jose State that supports me.**

If you find something in that doc that I still haven't answered I'm willing to answer it here. If you'd like to continue to watch my journey I'm @ohilyssa on instagram and @fanofpawl on MyFitnessPal.

My mini-bio: Mark Rippetoe is the author of Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training, Practical Programming for Strength Training, Strong Enough?, Mean Ol' Mr. Gravity, and numerous journal, magazine and internet articles. He has worked in the fitness industry since 1978, and has been the owner of the Wichita Falls Athletic Club since 1984. He graduated from Midwestern State University in 1983 with a Bachelor of Science in geology and a minor in anthropology. He was in the first group certified by the National Strength and Conditioning Association as a CSCS in 1985, and the first to formally relinquish that credential in 2009. Rip was a competitive powerlifter for ten years, and has coached many lifters and athletes, and many thousands of people interested in improving their strength and performance. He conducts seminars on this method of barbell training around the country.

**Edit**: phone dying. Will answer more in a couple hours.  

**Edit 2**: Copied from a post I made earlier in the thread, for people wondering how she got to this point:

she pointed out that because the primary goal was competition, her regiment was very specific and tailored to her in particular. With that said, the workout and diet have changed in the past couple of months as she gets closer to competition. 90% of this shape was achieved prior to the silly diet and workout, and it was done using the ""Clean Eating"" diet (zero preservatives), weight training (2-3x per week @ 1.5 hours/session), and consistent slow burn cardios (2-3x per week @ 1.5 hours/session). Weight went from roughly 170 down to 125 (now at 114).
I mentioned 'silly diet and workout' as in more recent weeks, she's ramped up to cut away all the fat. On some days, she might have 6 portions of boiled chicken and broccoli for the whole day, and 36 egg whites + 12 whole eggs on another day. Workout has also gotten ridiculous where she will spend 4 hours at the gym doing 1 hour cardio, 2 hours depletion (450 biceps, 450 triceps), then another hour of cardio.

**Edit 3**: Major thanks goes out to all the mods who have been removing garbage from this thread.

**Edit 4**: My SO suggested I point out that a few months ago she did 3 spin classes back to back to test her endurance. Notbad.jpg

**Edit 5**: I was wrong about the 900 per muscle, it's 900 per muscle *group*

**Edit 6**: She's super happy about the positive response this got. Wasn't expecting anything really (I just said ""hey, we should post this to Reddit"").

Fat girl at work, who is admittedly very active and energetic, called me ""too skinny"" in front of a few co-workers in a friendly session of office jest. I can take a joke and shit, so it didn't bother me, but when I quickly retorted ""well you're too fat, so I guess we're even"" everyone got quiet, and then someone called me an asshole.

So you know, fuck. I don't get the double standard where you can call a person too skinny but can't call a person too fat. That's bullshit man.

*clarify: not offended by being called skinny, but annoyed that attacking my weight is fair game but the reverse was not...getting called an asshole was not very cool. It wasn't like ""haha, you're such a funny asshole"", it was more like ""dude you're just a straight up asshole"".

**Today's lesson: Fat people don't like being called fat, so we shouldn't call them fat. Skinny people don't like being called skinny, but they should just shut up and take it...skinny bastards.

****Summary of comments, from most common to least:

1. She deserved it

2. You're an asshole

3. She deserved it but you're still an asshole

4. Here's some advice despite you not asking for any and me not really knowing anything about what happened.

5. Intelligent discussion

***** Final comment from me: Guys don't want to be skinny. Being called weak and skinny is not a subtle compliment. She said I was too weak and skinny to be of any use on the company soccer team. This wasn't some jealous girl shyly wishing she was skinny like me. She called me weak and useless. That's a pretty clear insult. Girls may want to be skinny, but guys don't want to be, because skinny is weak. Girls want to be pretty, guys want to be strong. Calling a guy skinny and weak is attack on his masculinity. It was very clear that's the message she was trying to convey when she called me ""too skinny"". Since she attacked my physical ""usefulness"" to the soccer team, I attacked hers (she's on the team). That was the context of the banter.

Thank you so much everybody!  I will be presenting this to my boss. I appreciate everybody's feedback, be it positive or negative. If this works...and after I purchase it I will make sure to post pictures of the treadmill.  For everybody that was concerned about the noise or how I am supposed to be able to work while walking...  The tread is specifically designed for walking office use.  It will probably be used at a pace of .5mph or 1mph.  At 1mph the tread only produces 35db and I would not be wearing loud shoes if I plan on walking all day.  Even at this measly pace of .5 mph people could expect to burn a significant number of calories but this has more to do with just staying moving and not sitting myself to death.  This is not a replacement for the gym nor does it really qualify as cardio. This is just a better alternative to sitting.  


My boss said that if I could get 11,000 signatures I could buy a treadmill and put it in my cubicle. I told him he underestimates the power of Reddit.  He did not seem impressed.  Can you help?

I will try to retype.

I went to the gym today and as I entered my weight into the elliptical (322lbs) I heard the girl next to me turn to her friend and say ""this girl is 300 pounds, oh my god"" with a look of disgust. I had my headphones in but the music was not on, so I highly doubt that she thought I could hear her. I turned to her and smiled and said ""I would love to see you do what I am about to do with 200 pounds of weight strapped to your arms, legs, and stomach."" She didn't say anything back and I just went ahead with my work out.

I can not thank this community enough. I have subscribed to various subreddits since March when I started the gym and I have since lost 25lbs. I started at a whopping 389lbs in November of 2011. I dropped down to 347lbs by March 2012 by completely quitting all fast food and soda (I was addicted to both - you don't get to my size without being so). In March 2012 I started going to the gym six days a week. I started at 347lbs and today I weigh 322lbs. I tried Keto for about a month but it just did not work for me. I eat a balanced diet and keep my calorie count under 1000 calories a day. I own a FitBit and my average calorie burn (because I am so heavy) during my 60 minutes of cardio is 1400 calories. 

It is A LOT of hard work and I deserve every painstaking minute on the equipment, I blame no one but myself for my weight. But this means I also give no one else the credit for my weight loss, the hard work that is finally slowly paying off. I thank everyone here for sharing their inspiring stories and encouragement, I read every day and find a new reason every day why I should keep going forward. Thank you all so very much. You inspire me every single day!

I can not tell you how thankful I am to have you all share your inspiring stories each and every day. It makes this process so much more enjoyable for me, knowing there are others working towards the exact same thing I am. I had no idea this would blow up like it did, and I am going to respond to everyone. It may take a while, but I promise I will. It means so much to me that you took the time to share your thoughts with me, so I want to personally acknowledge that. I truly appreciate everything that was said. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

I would probably kill myself if I even weighed over 250. 322 pounds is what a wild animal should weigh, not a fucking human being hahaha. Don't you have any self respect? Anyone who lets themselves become that fat deserves to be that fat. ""Oh its genetics"", ""I'm big boned""... fuck you. This is all because of your life decisions.

Here's my favorite:

I was at the gym in my university and I saw a pack of underclassmen doing bicep curls. One of the pack members broke off from the group and said, ""I'm going to go do squats bro."" The other members shuffled around in dissent. The general opinion among them was that working out legs was for pussies. The lone wolf bro said, ""I don't give a fuck guys, I have a date tonight."" This stopped the pack bros short. ""A date?"" they asked. ""Yeah dude, bitches can smell squat on you. It's the squats bro, they can smell it. I have to squat today."" The pack cracked up, imagining that this was a great joke, and a really novel way to get them to do legs. His face remained impassive: He was dead serious. He truly believed that bitches could smell squat on a man. After discussing his theory for roughly 5 minutes near me where I was doing decline bench, the lone wolf finally persuaded the rest of the pack and they all went to go do squats.

1339371933.0,2049,self.Fitness,uva9t,Big Reddit Protein Powder Measurement Results,2939,890,484,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/uva9t/big_reddit_protein_powder_measurement_results/,"I promised [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/te1rk/offering_broscience_service_ill_test_your_protein/) to measure the protein content of various supplement powders. Many people offered to send samples and I selected some. Yesterday and today after couple hours of work I finished the measurements. 

**[Here are the results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag9uT-E4EIL7dFZPZnR0WVZybGtFWnRKNzdKNm9XOVE#gid=0)**

My interpretation: I haven't measured any powder as 100% accurate. The reason probably is that none of it dissolved in water as good as my BSA standard. I gave a subjective solubility score to each. For example many chocolate flavored powders left a debris that looks like cacao, I gave them score of 4. Plant based powders didn't dissolve at all so got solubility score of 1 and obviously had low readings which doesn't mean anything. I guess they are just plant powders not isolated proteins. 

Brandwise, Optimum Nutrition looks very reliable to me. Gaspari and Body Fortress are suspicious and deserves another independent measurement. The others are OK, remember that solubility is important and 75% reading might just be attributable to that. Finally, **stay away from American Pure Whey**.

**EDIT:** For those of you who are suspicious of APW results, check out the [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/tcpmt/american_pure_whey_is_american_pure_shit/) that inspired this one. They did not find any protein either.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the bitcoin donations. I'll turn them into caffeine, that into science and hopefully that into more broscience.

**EDIT:** For those of you who are curious here is the [photo of the plate](http://imgur.com/QvDLy,almHo#0) and [my standard curve](http://imgur.com/QvDLy,almHo#1).

**EDIT:** As pointed out by the submitter MyProtein has a fine print that says cocoa in chocolate flavored protein makes the actual protein content %8 less than the unflavored one. We measured the chocolate version so I adjusted the claimed protein per serving from 19.6g to 18g. This pushed the reading to 90%.

**EDIT:** No, I'm not taking any more submissions. If I plan I'll post another call. In the meantime are there any other gym-rat/lab-rat that wants to take over?

**EDIT:** There has been very valuable suggestions in the comments by people who are more experienced than me in the lab. If anyone wants to do something similar in the future here are some thing we have learned:

* Sonicate your samples

* Try to find a research grade whey/casein standard from a reputable brand

* Seek for alternative assays (total nitrogen, Kjeldahl, HPLC etc.)

* If you are going to add detergent (which I didn't), make sure that your assay is compatible with that.

**EDIT:** Gaspari posted an [official response](http://www.gasparinutrition.com/news/articleview.aspx?ArticleID=276).

**FINAL EDIT: I would like to add one last comment. This experimentation created thousands of comments around the net, especially in bb.com forums. Many people raised concerns about the testing methods, many raised concerns about Gaspari products. I want to state that I know me doing this is ridiculous. But it is not ridiculous because my testing method has a large margin of error (of course it does) but because I am the only one in the world that does this. Please reflect on the status quo rather than single outing Gaspari. Here is a billion dollar industry and no qualified third party is doing a comparative analysis and customers don't seem to care. Can you imagine a world where CPUs and GPUs are not benchmarked? Of course some benchmarking methods are flawed or not suitable for certain products but that is not the point. Somebody should do it and it had to start somewhere. Let's push places like Cosumer Reports, large fitness websites or magazines to do this properly. I hope my effort can raise enough awareness. That is my only wish. So long.**",,False,,t5_2qhx4,1339712347.0,,,True,t3_uva9t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/uva9t/big_reddit_protein_powder_measurement_results/,

I'd been training for a few months and knew that this was going to be the most physically demanding thing yet.

It took about 14 hours and 32 minutes, but I managed to break the old record of 23.11 miles to an UNREACHABLE 23.22 miles :P  

I was really excited about it and don't know too many subreddits that would appreciate the mileage so I wanted to share it with you guys.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1tIFYVRF5U

Guinness does allow a 5 minute break every hour, so I would go a few hours and take a quick 5 min rest to relax the legs.  Eating and drinking was done on the pogo.

Edit: For those wondering, this was done at the OC Fair during the annual championships of extreme pogo sticking.  Here's a cool vid that shows some of the tricks pogoers can do now with tech and big air sticks:

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/V7No9.jpg) is the current photo un-cropped and higher resolution. What a difference between two seasons of flag football. I didn't take very many pictures along the way while losing fat so I actually had a hard time believing that I looked that different and seeing those pictures really made me feel strange. I legitimately didn't recognize myself.

On the left I'm ~355 Lbs, on the right I'm ~200 Lbs.

I still want to lose another ~30 Lbs of fat before I consider stage 1 (massive fat cut) to be complete. So even though this isn't my ""official"" before and after, I'll post some details:

* **Timeframe**: ~15 months. Started cutting December 27th, 2010. The ""after"" photo was taken yesterday.

* **Diet**: Nothing incredibly specific, I just counted calories, and tried to stay high protein and low carb (but I wasn't obsessive about macros by any means). I used www.myfitnesspal.com to track calories. No supplements, no protein powder, just regular food. I haven't eaten fast food once in 15 months and I have no desire to, my tastes have changed and it doesn't even sound good. My girlfriend and I cook all our own healthy meals at home now.

* **Exercise**: I did *some* exercise every single day. I missed a few days obviously with injuries and getting run down after a while, but I never scheduled a single off day for myself. I did a crap load of cardio. I know it's not strictly necessary for losing fat, but it doesn't hurt, and when you're as out of shape as I was you actually need the cardiovascular benefits. I did everything: walking, jogging, sprint intervals, elliptical, biking, swimming, etc. I didn't have any set plan, I just did something every day for at least a half hour. I did a ton of sports too since I've always enjoyed pretty much all sports. Don't worry, I lifted weights too. I followed Starting Strength (minus the diet part obviously) for most of the 15 months. Obviously, being on such a massive calorie deficit, I didn't make incredible gains, but I still feel stronger and my lifts went up some. My squat went from 135 to 255 (these are all 3x5 working set numbers btw), deadlift from 135 to 275, I don't remember where I started OHP at but I'm now doing 90 Lbs, I still haven't got the hang of power cleans (and I didn't do them the whole time anyway), and I switched my bench from barbell to dumbell about half way through and currently bench 60 Lb dumbells.

Thank you for offering your immediate assistance when you saw that I was trapped by the bar because I decided to bench without a spotter. Not only was I benching without a spotter, I was also increasing my reps and had started out 10 pounds more than usual. Because of this, my last attempted rep did not work out how I planned. You saw the disappointment and embarrassment in my eyes once you had helped me re-rack the bar, and you were quick to offer me excellent advice.


You said, ""Don't worry about it, this kind of thing happens to all of us. It isn't anything to be embarrassed about, and frankly, you ought to forget about it right now. If you think about it, you're going to be afraid of the bench, and you don't have a reason to. Mistakes are made, but training more will only help you decrease the chance of making those mistakes. Forget what happened, and finish your workout."" 

To that, I say thank you; your words of encouragement in that situation made it much less frustrating than it otherwise would have been.

http://i.imgur.com/NiQ91DM.jpg Me after my morning Ashtanga practice

About 2 years ago I restarted my weight loss journey after regaining about 130lbs after losing over 180lbs at age 20 and getting a panniculectomy.  When I lost the weight originally it was through atkins and tons of cardio, this time I had the power of Reddit in my corner. 

Since then all my blood lipid levels are now within healthy range and I have been able to drop three out of four of my asthma medications not to mention the relief of debilitating depression and lack of self esteem. I posted a while back about winning a weight loss competition  http://bit.ly/XOpxhu and you told me to post on my continued progress well I am back to do just that. 

My diet has been aided by the use of myfitnesspal and macronutrient counting. Learning how much my body needs instead of eating whatever I wanted has been a struggle but I am getting better at it all the time. I eat oats in the morning most days. Salmon or chicken is my primary protein source with the occasional whey shake. I also have a cheat meal once a week to keep me sane. Lately I have been eating at a caloric surplus in order to attempt to fill out some of the loose skin with muscle and become more aesthetic. 

I have continued to weight train using a traditional bodybuilding split focusing on compound movements at low reps to start each workout and I run. 

Lifts currently Squat 5 x 275 Bench 5 x 205 Military Press 5 x 115 Deadlift 5 x 315

I also have been practicing traditional Mysore style Ashtanga yoga 6 days a week. Yoga is my main focus lately because the benefits seem to transcend the physical. I practice 6 days a week (except for the new/full moons) in the early morning and I go to a teacher about 90 minutes away from my home in order to learn the practice from a qualified professional. I am only able to afford to do this about once a month. I am currently in a haiku contest to try to win a $200 gift certificate to my favorite yoga studio Moksha Yoga in Chicago if you could throw me a vote it would help me immensely to be able to continue my education in the practice. Link to my submission here  http://bit.ly/12i6uvD 

Thank you so much for all you in the community have done for me through your inspiration and quality information you spread here daily. I have relied on this place for so much in my journey so far and will definitely continue to do so. My goals for the future are to continue to challenge myself physically and to maintain a healthy lifestyle for the rest of my life. 

Namaste!

--------------------------------------------------------------
**The full story:** I have never been a fit person.  In high school, I was every gym teacher’s nightmare- constantly “forgetting” my gym clothes and only participating when forced to.  I also suffered from a debilitating illness that often left me bedridden. In two years, I saw over 40 different doctors.  At one point, I was wearing double knee braces and popping tons of pain pills just to be able to walk.  Eventually, I diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, with Sjogren’s disease as a likely secondary.  In college, I slowly started to get better.  I pulled myself off almost all of my meds because of side effects, and the worst symptoms faded as I got older, although I still had issues with the arthritis in my knees and chronic nausea.  

In my sophomore year of college, they opened up a brand new rec center.  My then-boyfriend forced me to go with him.  He quickly quit working out to play video games, and while I kept going, I fell into the typical cardio-bunny cycle: binge eating followed by guilt-driven exercise.  I mainly did the elliptical and weight machines, but never really made any progress.   

In May of last year, I planned a vacation and wanted to get “toned” for the beach.  I found r/xxfitness, made a post complaining about jiggly thighs, and was promptly ordered to squat.  I started browsing r/fitness religiously and read Starting Strength.  I went into the weightroom for the first time terrified.  I got to the squat rack and almost left.  But I stayed, and it turned out – I really fucking loved weightlifting.  I started going 6 days a week. Within a month, the pain and swelling in my knees had disappeared.  I started tracking my foods, eating more, and my chronic nausea got better.

In September, I started in on Stronglifts, and made some really awesome progress.  I began to stall, and was informed that it was due to my eating habits.  I had been a vegetarian for 7 years, but powerlifting converted me.  I switched to Texas Method in March and started bulking with ALL the meats (and by all, I mean bacon). 

Now I’m working with a trainer learning Olympic lifting, and eventually I would like to compete.  Fitness has gone from being something I hated, to my major hobby. I lift 3x a week, play on my company’s softball team, and go to a weekly bootcamp class. I even ran my first race 2 weeks ago.  Fitocracy has been a huge motivating factor along the way, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is getting into lifting.  My numbers aren’t as strong as I would like them to be, but it’s been a hell of a year with school on top of working full time.  And overall, I am very happy with my progress.

[My Year Of Hard Work In Photos](http://i.imgur.com/A1xLY.jpg)

Hello All!

I believe it was around the 9th month mark or so I had posted here and promised to update again; January 7th marks my official '1 Year of Training' progress. Hopefully this helps to motivate people who were in my spot last year - tired all the time, lazy, and completely depressed with who I had become. Looking back, I feel ashamed I'd let myself go so much; I don't ever intend to return to that lifestyle again.

Some quick infos:

- The scar is from pyloric stenosis, an operation I had at a few weeks old.

- I am a photographer full time, thus the many cameras.

- Initially Jan through March I was pretty strictly 'cardio only'; April, however, I purchased a full weightlifting cage, barbells, etc. and began to focus on that as my main means of exercise during my cut. I would highly advise anyone who was in a similar spot body-wise to **lift as heavy a weight as you can during your cut!** . I am quite sure that a strong core allowed me to avoid stretch marks and the 'skinnyfat' look of someone who lost weight but still looks..'sloppy'. 

- My diet was pretty straight-forward; at least -500 calories a day from my estimated maintenance (though often more then that) based on a protein-rich selection of foods. 

Anyways, enough typing. I hope this maybe helps someone out - I still would like to add maybe 15lbs of muscle this year before I feel happy overall, but I'm proud of the first year of my new life. Cheers all.

**edit** I'm 6'1"", late 20's. Oh so late 20's. :(  


**edit2**

Unimpressive lifts at present:

Bench went from 165 1RM to 240 1RM; squat when I started I thought was 230, but I later realized how poor my form was (I was barely doing knee bends), so now my 1RM Squat is 230 ATG (i think, have it written down in the gym). Deadlift I didn't track when I started, but is up to 355lbs 1RM now.

Yeah...,2885,997,950,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1bov8l/got_a_call_from_the_24_hr_fitness_club_manager/,"A few days ago my local 24 hour fitness posted [this](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/543853_569468119740021_2049800803_n.jpg) image to their facebook. I commented on the photo ""thank you for my daily dose of pseudoscience"". A lame joke, I know, but at the time I thought it would be a very funny goof and a spoof. The comment was removed by them almost instantly. A couple of days pass and I get a voice mail from the club manager Tyler asking me to call him back (this was yesterday). I call the club, get the front desk, and they transfer me to Tyler. I can't remember every thing that was said exactly, but this is more or less how it went: I tell him who I am and the first thing he says is ""Why don't you go ahead and help me understand your comment on our facebook page."" His tone was very authoritative, like I was in big trouble. I said ""I don't have to explain anything I do on the internet to you."" He said ""I'm calling to give you a chance to make this right, before we go ahead and revoke your membership."" I couldn't believe this was happening, I'm about to get banned for a Facebook comment? I said ""I don't know what you want me to say. I'm not gonna explain to you a comment I made so that you'll let me keep my membership."" He said something like ""I'm gonna give you one more chance before I go ahead and get corporate involved."" I was pretty upset at this point at the absurdity of all this and sorta lost my temper. I said something like ""I don't see this as you looking for an explanation, I see this as you calling me up and bullying me about a Facebook comment I made and I'm not going to continue this conversation with you."" I hung up as he was saying something like ""Ok I'm going to go ahead and give corporate a call..."" The whole thing happened so fast and I still don't really know what to make of it. It was like a bad dream.

That's about it. It's the next day now and I haven't gotten another call from anyone and my membership is still active (I went in and checked in with my fingerprint last night). Not sure what to expect the next time I go in there in the daytime. I was hoping to see what you guys think about it and how I should have handled it etc. I know there was definitely a better way to go about it, but I was really kind of caught off guard and let my emotions get the best of me. I wish I would have stayed on the phone longer and asked him to tell me what the comment said, why it was offensive, etc. but I had trouble thinking straight. Also, if anyone has ideas on how to handle it if he confronts me the next time I go in, I would love to hear them.

**tl;dr I am maybe getting banned from 24 hour fitness for trolling their facebook, manager called very angry, I got mad and hung up and it looks like I haven't been banned yet.**

**EDIT: I just called customer service and they offered to escalate the call to the district manager (Tyler's boss). The representative said I would get a call from him in 1-3 days.**

**MY STORY:**

Embarrassingly, it all began with a tragic ice-skating accident. I mustered up the confidence to attempt an axel on the ice, which was the best idea I’ve had since wearing a thong for my high schools opposite sex day.

Halfway through my spin, the toe pick on my right skate got caught in the ice as I’m rotating and SNAP, there went my fibula, right in half.

My punishment was 3 months in a cast and crutches. My activity declined to 0, but my appetite did not. I ordered take out at almost every meal, picking all the wrong choices and just when it couldn’t get worse, I became incredibly addicted to video games. Since sports were no longer an option, video games filled the competitive void that was missing.

On a real note
- this was one of the darkest moments of my life. I hadn’t experienced isolation like this before, being unable to do a lot of activities I loved. I (an extrovert by nature) became considerably introverted and locked myself away in my room for hours upon end every day. 

3 months later I was a competitive and feared gamer (n00bs), but it wasn’t until then, when I was out of my cast and left the man cave, which I came to realize I was no longer Batman in Gotham City. I was his arch nemesis the Penguin, relatively speaking.

Over the next 2 years, I made a life changing transformation that changed the way I thought, the way I felt, how I carried myself, and what I believed was achievable. A lot of trial and error was involved, and there are certainly things I would have changed, but this is how I got there.

 

**MY WORKOUT:**

I never worked out on the weekends, not because I couldn’t, but because weekends are too unpredictable. Relatives come to visit, bros want to hang out, girlfriend wants to go for a spa day, etc. I worked an 8-hour shift, Monday through Friday, and treat my workouts as an extension of my workday.

I cycled my workouts every 6-8 weeks, taking a week deload for every month of training, so in this case, roughly 2 weeks in-between each cycle.

Your body responds differently to certain types of training just as it does to particular foods, and this is where trial and error comes in. There are many training types that will work, but you want to find the intensity, frequency, volume, and training type that work best for you.

I always rotated between a strength cycle (4-6 reps) and hypertrophy cycle (8-12 reps).

I experimented with many training modalities ranging from 2-day full body splits to 6-day splits that hit every muscle group twice per week. I also tried separate resting protocols, ranging from your traditional 3-minute rest between sets to different types of MRT (Metabolic Resistance Training) where I did reps for time with as little as 20 seconds of rest between sets. What I eventually found to work best for me was a 5-day hypertrophy split, Monday – Friday working separate muscle groups each day paired with traditional rest times between exercises (1-2 minutes).

I’m an 20/80 guy, meaning I believe that 20% of the exercises gets you 80% of the results. I stuck with many of the basic compound &amp; power lifts for both cycles (strength and hypertrophy), but added more targeted exercises in my hypertrophy cycles to focus on definition in a few key areas.



**KEYS TO MY WORKOUT SUCCESS:**

* Correct compensated movement patterns.

    People joke about Quasimodo but I’ve seen a few of these mythical creatures lurking in the gym, and we can best assume it’s in part to compensated movement patterns. Before you begin lifting seriously, you need to have your foundation in check. Your form should be spot on before beginning any lifting program; otherwise you risk building strength on top of dysfunction.  This will lead to muscular imbalances, compensated movement patterns, and ultimately injury.

* Train in proper postural alignment.

    Ensure that with each movement, you’re going through the motions of your lift with proper posture and joint alignment. If you’re doing a seated cable row with your shoulders rounded forward (internally rotated), the rotator cuff muscles are extended, the anterior deltoid is shortened, and you’re developing the muscle fibers in this position. Again, avoid the Quasimodo.

* Make a mind-body connection with your muscles.

    This sounds like a total hoax but I kid you not. You have to make a mind-body connection with your muscles, and it’s a completely different sensation than lifting the weight up and putting it down. If you’re doing a pull-up, this means engaging the core, contracting the musculature involved (primarily the lats), and imagining the muscles being worked throughout each inch of the lift. Help your body connect the dots on every rep.  

* Don’t bullshit your workout, get in the zone.

    You need to take your workout seriously. When you’re at the gym, it’s not time to chat with your friend on the phone, check your email, or mingle with others for minutes on end. You need to make the mind-body connection with your muscles, make sure you are in proper postural alignment with every rep, ensure your form is nothing short of perfection, and strictly adhere to your rest times. That’s a lot of shit, and you need to be on top of it.

 

**MY AB WORKOUT:**

Let me make clear that abs are made in the kitchen, not the gym (upcoming blog post on this). Your diet exposes your abs, but it’s the work you put in the gym that carves them. You don’t eat a couple pieces of celery, 3 grapes, and a carrot stick and leave the house with a shredded 6 pack.

My abdominal workout consisted of 4 ab workouts per week, with 2 ab exercises per workout. I chose exercises that allowed me to apply progressive overload, just as I do with every other muscle group. Rather than increasing the intensity of an exercise by increasing the number of reps, I did so by increasing the resistance or difficulty.

Here is an example ab routine from one of my 5-day splits:


* Monday (exercises superset, 2 rounds)

    Weighted Sit-ups: 25lbs @ 20 reps

    Hanging Knee Raises: 15 reps @ 2-0-2-0 tempo

    60 sec rest

* Tuesday (exercises superset, 2 rounds)

    Plank: 1 minute

    Weighted Cycling Russian Twist: 25 lbs @ 15 reps/side

    60 sec rest

* Thursday (exercises superset, 2 rounds)

    Barbell Floor Sweeper: 185 lbs @ 12 reps

    Weighted Toe Crunch: 25 lbs @ 20 reps

    60 sec rest

* Friday (exercises superset, 2 rounds)

    Decline Reverse Crunch: 12 reps @ 2-0-2-0 tempo

    Side Plank: 1 minute (both sides)

    60 sec rest


[Here's a copy of the ab workout](http://thryv.com/workout/plans/467)

You’ll notice that I did no more than 4 sets of abdominal work for each ab day, with reps staying below 20. I’m a firm believer in following progressive overload with volume low and intensity high for abdominals.

The exercises above were selected because you can progressively overload them by increasing the resistance for ab exercises that utilized weight, or increase the intensity for others by increasing the difficulty of the exercise [i.e., Plank --&gt; TRXPlank, Hanging Knee Raises --&gt; Hanging Leg Raises]



**MY DIET &amp; SUPPLEMENTS:**

I didn’t count a single calorie. While I did attempt to (a short-lived 2 days), tracking with pen/paper was about as exciting as watching grass grow and every food-tracking tool I tried was inefficient and frustrating.

What I did count was the single handedly most important macro, protein. I always shot for roughly 1.5g/kg (~0.7g/lb) which was surprisingly easier to achieve than I thought.

Other than counting protein, my dietary regiment consisted of common sense, balance, and a dash of bacon. 

Before long, eating became a chore. I was never quite bothered with cooking before (although I am now), so my laziness forced me to eat the same breakfast, lunch, and dinner (for the most part) at every meal. Food was there to serve the purpose of giving my body the energy and nutrients it needed to continue growing.

I didn’t know what “Paleo” was at the time I was going through my transformation, but my dietary habits consisted of the same principles the Paleo diet follows. For that reason, I’m going to skip the diet details here and send you over to [/r/Paleo](http://www.reddit.com/r/paleo)

**Supplements**
My goal was (and still is) to stay completely natural, so for that reason I only used 3 supplements and a fat burn stack.

    Pre-Workout: NO-Xplode (cycled)
    Post-Workout: Whey Protein
    Night-Time: Casein Protein
    Fat Burn Stack: Green Tea Extract, CLA, Fish Oil

Pertaining to the Fat Burn Stack, I’ve been asked a number of times how this helped and honestly, I can’t say. I don’t have any data to quantify the difference it made in my personal transformation, although there are a number of people who live by it.

But on a side note, fish burps are the worst, seriously.



**KEY THINGS THAT KEPT ME HEALTHY DURING MY TRAINING:**

* Dynamic Warm-ups

    You need to prepare your muscles for the movements and stresses they are about to endure. Working on chest? Do some Rolling T-Pushups to work the concentric/eccentric movements of the chest/triceps and stabilization of the shoulders. Leg day? Get in some lunge + rotation’s to warm-up the lower body musculature / core or perform a few alternating groiners.

* Adequate Rest

    I can’t stress this enough. Not just rest between workouts, but rest between exercises. The rest time between exercises will vary depending on your rep range (3-6, 8-12, 15+), and training modality (MRT).  It’s completely natural to be itching to workout on your off days but stay disciplined. Exercise induces micro tears and inadequate rest is the quickest 1-way ticket to overtraining.

* Foam Rolling

    Also known as SMR (Self Myofascial Release). I attribute much of my recovery speed to foam rolling. It provides a good deep tissue massage and increases blood flow to the muscle, reducing your recovery time between workouts. To the previous point about exercise induced micro tears, foam rolling helps to break up adhesions in the muscle.



**MORALE OF THE STORY:**

Getting to 5% was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever done, but also one of my greatest accomplishments.

You always hear the cliché “fitness isn’t temporary, it’s a life long journey”, and this is true. Therefore you need to begin with a solid foundation and work your way from the basics.

My advice?

Experiment with different training modalities and focus on outcomes. Quantify your results and understand your body. Then keep your diet and workout SPE; Sustainable, Practical, Enjoyable.

It’s great to have your fitness idols and strive to mimic their physique but you have to be patient, persistent, and persevere. You will hit plateaus, need to overcome mental barriers, and occasionally frequent the ideas of calling it quits but remember everyone started from the bottom, even Arnold.

My starting weight in March of 2010 was 538 pounds. The month after I started my weight loss mission, my wife and I decided I should do monthly progress pictures and measurements. I've been keeping track of everything since. [I have 21 progress pictures on my blog now.](http://foodisforfuel.com/progress-pics/)

* [This was my first picture.](http://foodisforfuel.com/wp-content/gallery/progress/521-04-12-2010.jpg) 

* [This is how I look today.](http://foodisforfuel.com/wp-content/gallery/progress/269-11-02-11.jpg)

I weighed in this morning at 269 pounds, which is exactly one half of what I weighed when I started. In a year and a half, I've cleaved myself in two. 

* My waist is 26 inches smaller. 
* My hips are 25.5 inches smaller.
* My chest is 19.25 inches smaller.

I get asked often how I was able to do it. The answer is inception. Through communities like these, an idea got planted in my brain that wouldn't have been planted otherwise. The idea was that I could be great; that I could take control of myself and become not just a functioning human being but an athlete and become better than I'd ever been. I spent years in a dark room, lit only by my monitor. Blue sky hurt my eyes. But then through the same Internet that helped me destroy my life, I found the foundation to rebuild.

* [SomethingAwful's Ultimate Transformation Thread](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3334499) is similar to [LoseIt's Hall of Fame](http://www.flickr.com/photos/loseit/sets/72157626414086985/show/http://www.flickr.com/photos/loseit/sets/72157626414086985/show/) and it hit me like a ton of bricks. I scrolled down seeing people changing everything about themselves. Picture after picture of people on the Internet who took control.

After years of self loathing and depression, I saw a tiny dot of light. It's easy to let yourself die when you think you have nothing to live for -- no purpose or reason to exist. But that tiny dot of light became everything to me. 

* [I started a fitness log and meticulously tracked everything I did.](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3292685&amp;userid=0&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=1) 
* I did tons of research. I learned about the human body.
* I picked a diet. [Ketogenic low carb](http://josepharcita.blogspot.com/2011/03/guide-to-ketosis.html) fit my needs the best.
* I took my fitness seriously but also took it slow.

I knew that I'd quit if I tried to push myself too hard, which was a conclusion that I made from a large sample size -- a life spent quitting everything. I started off doing simple body weight exercises and used some lame 20 lb dumb bells to do presses and flys.

I dynamically assigned myself workout routines based on the adaptation of my body to its new size as I got smaller. As I became more fit, I pushed myself more. I eventually felt good enough to start lifting heavier weights. 

* I got a weight bench because I knew I was too ashamed to work out in front of people and if I tried to force myself to do it, I'd quit.
* I studied different lifting programs and ended up using [sean10mm's Modified Starting Strength](http://goonlifter.wikispaces.com/sean10mm's+Modified+Starting+Strength) program.

Last year around this time, I still weighed 424 pounds. I'd lost 114 pounds but I was still super morbidly obese. This is what I think back to when people now ask me how I kept going -- how I found the will power to keep pushing forward.

* [This is what I looked like on my birthday last year.](http://foodisforfuel.com/wp-content/gallery/progress/424-11-03-10.jpg)

The reason I kept going is because when I looked in the mirror, I didn't see that face or body. I saw what I would be today, and today, I see what I'm going to be in 6 months. In 6 months, I'll see what I'm going to be in a year.

I was able to lose so much weight because I never thought about how flawed I was. I only thought about how I could become who I wanted to be and when that was the only thought flooding my mind, my imperfections became irrelevant because ultimately, they were temporary.

Now I'm using [Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 weight training system](http://www.amazon.com/Simplest-Effective-Training-Increase-Strength/dp/0557248299/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320247531&amp;sr=8-1), which is more advanced, but works well with my goals and my declining strength as I cut weight. I modified it to include more volume as I felt able to do more.

Yesterday, I did 59 deadlift reps. I did 125 curl reps. I did 53 push ups. I did 57 overhead barbell squats. I lift weights 4 days a week. I play basketball -- just shooting by myself -- for something like 5 hours a week. I didn't have a cake because I no longer arbitrarily attach food to celebrations or holidays. I discovered that food is for fuel and that real joy needs to come from life experiences. The joy of mobility trumps the ever-living-hell out of the joy of icing.

I can do that now because I didn't kill myself in a gym or on a treadmill a year ago. I didn't tempt myself to quit so I could push through it and become a ""better person"" for it. I didn't get a personal trainer's raging spittle all over my grill. I paced myself and my fitness evolved with my body. You don't have to render yourself breathless to be able to truly appreciate the air you breathe. You just have to keep breathing.

* [Here's a video of my fitness evolution.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBBU-Cuosfg&amp;feature=channel_video_title) I did my first dips with good depth last week.

So happy birthday to me. Next year, I'm going to be even better. My life still isn't what I want it to be but I don't give a shit what it is now. I'm interested in what it can be tomorrow, or the next week, or the next month, or the next year. And next year, I'll be focusing on who I'll be the year after that.

I'm half the man I used to be but I'm nowhere near the man I'm going to be.

I don't really know what to post for information, so if you guys have some questions, ask in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them!


Edit:

I've been asked to explain how I managed to lose the weight in more detail.

When I first started losing weight, the hardest part was limiting the amount of calories I consumed.  Eventually I found a diet that worked and didn't make me feel hungry throughout the day.

I don't think my diet is considered ""unhealthy"", but I'm not a nutrition nut.  I keep track of my calories I take in on myfitnesspal, and I aim for around 1700-2000 calories a day.  I workout 5-6 times a week, including cardio and weight lifting.  I also managed to complete two rounds of Insanity, which is probably the hardest thing I've ever done.

I've fallen off track a few times.  In December of last year and this previous January, I had a 1.5 month period where I went back to old habits and started eating a lot and drinking soda.

I'm allowed to post a [bonus photo](http://imgur.com/AQbBs) because of all the kind words :)

**Congrats team, you've got her wanting to learn how to DL, OHP and Clean. I threw that little part in about her not wanting to do it to elicit the classic responses I've come to learn and love.
you guys did not disappoint and have helped me to convince her to open up to these key compound movements. Good job.jpg**

Took my gals [photos](http://imgur.com/JK8gE) and compared them to exactly a year ago.

It sure is hard sticking to a diet, but she's done really well and I'm bloody proud of her.

She eats food, no miracles, cheats every now and then, and simply hits the gym extra hard next time we are in the gym. Eats at a deficit to lose fat, eats protein to be as strong as she feels neccesary.

We lift weights together, no SS or 100 reps...
Just between 8 and 12 reps, 3 sets of most of the below...

Please note our gym is not amazingly equipped and we are just normal people who eat, drink, lift and have fun :)

**Age** - 21

**Weight** - 60kg

**Height** 166cm

**BF%** - I don't know, take a guess?


**Routine/ Numbers**

**Mon**

* barbell bench - 40kg including bar

* dumbbell bench - 15kg dumbells

* dips - body weight 

* overhead rope tricep extensions - level 25 (machine)



**Weds**

* barbell squats - 50kg (currently working on form to fix buttwink)

* leg press - level 80 (machine)

* calf raise - 120kg

* rope glute extension - level 20 (machine)

* goblet squats - 15kg plate



**Friday**

* pull ups - I assist her

* overhead dumbbell press - 12.5kg dumbbells

* lat pull down - level 45 (machine)

* cable row - level 30 (machine) 

* cable bicep curl - level 30 (machine)




*She doesn't want to learn how to dead lift or barbell ohp or clean/jerk/anything overly difficult.*

This is a fairly hard post to write on my phone and I am happy to answer questions.

If this is motivation for even one lady hoping lifting will get her looking leaner and stronger then that will be awesome. ",,False,,t5_2qhx4,1354051294.0,,,True,t3_13vbqa,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/13vbqa/my_girls_progress_photos/,

 amounts of protein per serving. Not shockingly, Amercan Pure Whey is confirmed to be awe inspiringly shitty and also not shockingly, Wal*Mart's Body Fortress sucks too but not as hard.

[Give him your upvotes!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/uva9t/big_reddit_protein_powder_measurement_results/)

**Hail Redditors, I come to you with news from [another forum](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3470330&amp;userid=0&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=39#post403417301). A guy named Zugzwang (cool as fuck) decided to bust science on American Pure Whey powder, after many suspicious bros wondered why it was A) so cheap and B) tasted so good. The results were interesting and as follows:**

&gt;Brothers, I have just returned from my laboratory dungeon and do not have good news regarding American Pure Whey. I need to formally work up the numbers, but a qualitative eyeballing of the results tells me that either I royally fucked up these two assays (not likely, considering I did 8 independent ones for four separate APW flavors) or there is far less protein in their powder than they claim.

&gt;Here, see for yourselves. I've crudely labeled the wells on this plate for you. One of my assays (detergent-compatible Lowry) basically makes the wells in this plate turn a dark color if there's protein in it, and the darker the well, the more protein there is. I tested blanks (buffer only, no protein), analytical-grade bovine serum albumin at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/mL, ON double rich chocolate (chosen because it's a whey product from a reputable company) at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 3.0 mg/mL, and four separate APW flavors (cinnamon bun, strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla) at 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/mL. Now, those APW concentrations assumed that the values on the label (26 grams protein/33 grams powder) were reliable.

&gt;tl;dr - darker = more protein, APW wells should be roughly as dark as ON wells, they aren't

&gt;* [HARK, A PICTURE OF LITERAL BRO SCIENCE](http://i.imgur.com/XNAa5.png)

&gt;Note: the first three wells in the ""Blanks/APW"" row - under the BSA wells - are blanks, then the next three - under the ON wells - are from another APW sample.

&gt;And yes, I can quantify the amount of protein in the APW samples from absorbance measurements I took from the plate. I think. Shit might be too dilute and out of range of the standard curve I'm making. We'll see.

&gt;The other assay type I ran is a standard method for protein determination: measure how much 280-nm UV light it absorbs. I tested blanks and each protein powder at 1 mg/mL, and though you can't tell just by eyeballing it here (they all look clear), I can tell you that the absorbance of the ON wells was 5-10+ times any of the APW wells, and all were at the same nominal concentration. I'm working within the dynamic range of the instrument, so absorbance correlates linearly to the amount of protein, meaning that 5x the absorbance means 5x as much protein.

&gt;I'm going to repeat the A280 assay tomorrow because it's quick, easy, and it works, but fuuuuuck. The only other explanation besides ""piece of shit product"" is that the bits of APW powder I grabbed were the non-protein bits, which could mean that their powder is horribly mixed - either that, or I'm a goddamned wizard of entropy, because what are the odds of me grabbing 50 milligrams of filler from four separate samples?

&gt;Also hi, if there are any other labcoats reading this and you have 10 minutes to run a quick-n-dirty A280 test on some APW powder to corroborate or contest my results, that would be super, thanks.

**tl;dr: Your cheap powder is shady as fuck and you should feel bad.**

**But never underestimate the depraved boredom inherent in all denizens of this fine Internet.**

Redditor [christek](http://www.reddit.com/user/christek) for some reason decided to ping both americanpurewhey.com and palmeranalyticalservices.com and [discovered they're on the same server](http://i.imgur.com/578k3.png).

I then decided to get my stalk on and discovered that [121 domains share that IP](http://domaincoleta.com/reverseIP/72.167.232.212). Shared hosting is fairly common but it's a pretty goddamn big Internet and that's an incredible coincidence. I'm led to believe that in the place of protein, this dastardly product is rife with motherfucking tom-foolery.

**EDIT: Holy hell. We've uncovered a vast conspiracy to commit bromicide! It was APW in the kitchen with the gains :(**

Just saw this post by a user named Bluff:

I was a three-sport athlete in high school and I ate like one. When my playing days stopped, my eating habits didn't. I went from 175 in 2010 to 210 in 2012. After my youngest daughter was born, I decided that I needed to set an example for my kids (that and I could hardly breathe after walking up a flight of stairs). I started working out in September 2012 (I know it's been almost 12 months, but this picture is my 10 month picture) and got all the way down to 170 over the course of 7 months. Since then, I've been lifting heavier and eating 1000 over maintaining. In the picture, I'm 180. Today, I'm 185 with 7% body fat. Hope I can inspire someone.

  Day 1:

  210 lbs

  23% body fat

  Bench: 95x4

  Squat: 135x4

  Press: 60x4

  Curl: 20x4

  Dead: 155x4

  Day 300:

  180

  8% body fat

  Bench: 225x6

  Squat: 315x6

  Press: 205x6

  Dead: 365x6

  They came out a bit blurry, but I don't have a nice camera...what can I say?

  **One more edit:** I will post meals and a workout plan either tomorrow or tonight. 

  **Workout/Split (Current) 60-90 seconds between sets:** (Disclaimer, I'm doing a ton of drop sets right now)

  **Meal Plan** *(Note: this is just an example of one day's meal plan)*

  *Breakfast/Pre-workout*

  5 scrambled egg whites

  1 cup oats with stevia, cinnamon, and a tablespoon of PB

  2 pieces of whole wheat toast

  1 cup of coffee, black with stevia

  Preworkout drink with Creatine

  6 oz Ahi Tuna Steak

  1 cup asparagus

  1/2 cup spiced red beans

  That's it. Sometimes on heavy lift days, I'll throw a Casein protein shake in before bed, but that about covers it. I hope this helps everyone. ",,False,,t5_2qhx4,1375589772.0,,,True,t3_1jn26c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1jn26c/10_month_transformation_photos/,

First of all, I would like to thank r/fitness and all of the members of this board who inspire me on a daily basis. When I see your progress posts or read your stories, it makes me push myself harder. You are all amazing people.  For those of you beginning your journey now, you got this. 

**MY STORY**


It started with a girl, like many of these progress posts seem to. I expressed my feelings and was told that I was not ""boyfriend material."" Hearing that made me melt down, partially because of my feelings, but mostly because I knew she was right. I had spent my first 3 years of college being the lazy kid, and more importantly, I had lost track of myself. My humor was rude, my diet was atrocious, and my motivation was at all all time low. I broke my ankle and leg in the middle of my sophmore year and during my weeks stuck on the couch, I became addicted to playing league of legends, an online computer game. 

These last 3 years were extremely difficult for me - my negative feelings consumed me, and I genuinely believed I would never feel differently. Despite how hard it was to hear, I am thankful that I had a wake up call - it  made me remember who I was and realize who I could be.  

What started out as something I did for her has transformed into a passion that has taught me infinitely more than how to pick up and put down heavy things. I will touch on what I've learned later in the post, but what I will say now is that it truly amazes me every day. 


**DIET**

*Note: I am lactose intolerant*


It all started with paying a little bit of attention to my intake. I dropped junk food for the most part and was more concious of the overall quality of food - aka, no mcdonalds, no dominos. 


When I got home from school for the summer, I took cutting seriously - I wanted my fat gone. 

**[Here is a photo of me at my thinnest \(~185-190 ---&gt; ~175\).](http://i.imgur.com/hZmCspH.jpg) This was 1 months difference.**

*The cut*


- I ate 1600-1800 calories a day, working out 6 days a week. 
- I lifted intensely for ~1.5 hours and followed that with 25 minutes of interval training, where I was burning 400-500 more calories.   I used the Arc Trainer cycling between high and low intensity since my ankle isn't fully recovered (can't fully run).
- This cut lasted ~3-4 weeks. 


On my cut my meals looked like this:


- Breakfast: *omelette, 2 scoop protein (after morning workout)*
- Lunch: *grilled chicken, tuna, or burger on wheat*
- Dinner: *grilled chicken or burger, salad, tons of veggies, whole wheat pasta or brown rice*


At the end of my cut, I began seeing slight stalls in my lifts. Because I am new, my lifts were going up throughout my cut, but something started to seem off. Based on a lot of browsing this sub, I knew I had to up my intake to gain muscle - I also didn't have much more fat to lose. I started aiming for 2200 a day, as I was having trouble getting myself to eat more. Now, I am trying to get up to ~2700 a day to break even or to 3000 for a slow bulk, but I'm having trouble getting myself to eat more.  I think it is largely mental - a fear of moving backwards and gaining fat again.

*Current Eating*: pretty much the same food as the cut, just more of it, and snacks.

**I aim for 200g of protein a day - achieved through eggs, meat, wheat bread, and whey shakes**

*I also aim for a certain number of carbs (300-400g) and fats (60g) on a training day* but am not as strict about this.  I used [this site](http://sareyko.net/leancalc/#/g=male/a=NaN/w=NaN/h=NaN/b=NaN/m=1.2/r=-20/t=20/p=2.5/e=NaN) to calculate all of this.

- I eat ~2500-2700 a day
- Breakfast: *2 eggs, sausage, wheat toast*
- Lunch: *turkey, tuna, or chicken on wheat*
- Dinner: *chicken or beef, brown rice or whole wheat pasta , broccoli/veggies, salad, 2 scoops whey (Isopure)*
- Snacks: *fruit, healthy protein bar*
- Alcohol: *I've had about 3 beers since I started to take my diet seriously*

**LIFTS**

I haven't really kept track of my 1RM, but here is what I know.

6/28 - **Bench** - 185 x 5; current 1RM: ~210

7/30 - **Bench** - current 1RM: 225



**ROUTINE**

*Note: I have a permanent back injury (disc degeneration at my L5 S1) preventing me from doing heavy squats and deadlifts. Because of this, some of the compound lifting programs weren't an ideal option.* 

I've always done a variation of a 3 day split.  I lift for nearly 2 hours 6 days a week, never a muscle group that is sore.

- **My current 3 day split:** chest/tri, back/bi, shoulders/legs. Abs every other day or more - same with obliques. Currently no cardio, as I dont want to lose. 

- [Here is a screenshot showing the exercises I do](http://i.imgur.com/t8PzSDy.png), just to keep this from being overwhelmingly long.  
- Super sets have been a staple of my workout since I started


**MENTALITY**

I've come to learn that lifting is as much a mental battle as it is a physical one.  Luckily, I had a girl I wanted to prove wrong to power me through my first few weeks of pain and soreness, and to help me push out my last few reps or that final set.  I'm not exaggerating when I say this was **HUGE**.  Having a constant source of motivation like that made a very very big difference for me.  

Since I've stopped caring about her, I've actually struggled a little bit with getting to that ""next level"" of intensity and motivation.  Sure, I try to get pumped up before the gym, but my focus faded slightly and the intensity did as well.  

Things that have helped me stay motivated since then

- [Kai Greene Training Videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL1B_r9nC9k)
- Focusing on working my muscles efficiently rather than the amount of weight I am working with.
- Thinking of the insane progress posts I see on this sub every day.

You may think you are giving it your all, but there is often a ""next level"" of your energy that you can reach.  It sounds obvious, but try to focus on the specific muscle you are working every time you are working it.  **Form is crucial.** Putting that extra 5 pounds on may make you tweak your shoulder or arm in a way that stops you from working the muscle efficiently.  


**WHAT I'VE LEARNED**

I could write forever about what this process has taught me, but again, I'll try to keep it short. 

Like it starts for many, I entered the gym with the goal of simply looking better; I was extremely unhappy with how I looked and knew I had let myself go.  While looking better is still a priority of mine, pushing myself in the gym and dedicating myself to a healthy lifestyle has taught me what I am truly capable of.  

When I look in the mirror at the gym during a workout or after when I get home, I am honestly astounded by how different I feel and look.  I can't even imagine feeling how I used to before I began this journey.  I have immense amounts of confidence in comparison to 2 months ago. 

I've learned:

- Whining about your problems will accomplish nothing.  It is up to you to fix yourself. 
- It is easier to stop thinking about how hard it will be and just do it.  It is far harder to live unhappily than it is to do the things necessary to be happy.  And the things you do may very well last your life time.
- What it means to truly dedicate myself to something and that I **CAN** do this
- What it means to push myself to my limit, and more importantly **respect my limits** (I read this in a post on /fitness once and will never forget it)
- That getting in better shape is directly correlated to confidence and # of girls who smile at you



**THANKS**

Once again, thank you to everyone on this board who takes the time to give advice, post your progress pictures, or encourage others to continue on their journeys.  Everyone who has dedicated themselves to fitness can acknowledge that it is not an easy process, and all of your words and encouragement make it that much easier for me to stay motivated every day.  

**If you have any questions or advice for me regarding my diet or routine I'd love to hear it.**  There are millions of people on here that know more than me, but I feel as though I may have something to offer because I was in your shoes so recently. I've made a lot of progress, but I'm no where near my end goal yet.  I can't wait to keep going!  I'll definitely be looking to post a 6 month update. :P

-------------------
**Background:**

I've made some mistakes in my past that I deeply regret and am doing everything to move on from.  Without going into too much detail, I was heavily involved in a business that is becoming legal in several states but at the time was not legal in Connecticut.  I was fortunate to have an excellent attorney and no criminal history.  Because of the scope of my operation though, the judge was insistent on jail time - 10 months imprisonment with 5 years probation and a 5 year suspended sentence.  I have always been an avid Crossfitter, yogi, jiu jitsu competitor, powerlifter, and all around athlete.  I made a commitment to myself before going in that I would do everything in my power to continue improving myself mentally, physically, and spiritually while inside, making the most of every moment and using it to workout, meditate, do yoga, reflect, read, and write.  I could write another entire post about yoga, meditation, and using the time to reflect, but I'll leave the focus of this post to working out.

**Update:**  I've been in the gym for about a week, re-testing my max lifts.  My squat went from 475 -&gt; ~435, deadlift 525 -&gt; 475, OHP 195 -&gt; 185, and did not test bench.  I've very pleased with these numbers, as I've been able to maintain significant strength.  Also considering I've lost about 20 lbs, I'm pound for pound as strong, if not stronger than before.


**Training:**

Pre-Prison:

Prior to heading in, I had been using Wendler's 5/3/1 program for about 1.5 years.  Prior to that I had been doing Crossfit for about 2 years, and prior to that I was following the workouts in the book The New Rules of Lifting for about 6 months.  My max lifts were 475 squat, 525 deadlift, 315 bench, 195 overhead press.  My split generally looked like this:

Monday: Squat
Tuesday: Bench
Wednesday: Hill Sprint Workout OR some type of Crossfit Metcon workout
Thursday: Jiu Jitsu Training OR Rest
Friday: Overhead Press
Saturday: Deadlift
Sunday: Active recovery -- Bikram yoga

Prison:
I only had access to a pullup bar, back extension station, dip station, and ab wheel, so all of my workouts were bodyweight.  I have read Convict conditioning and did a lot of research into good bodyweight workouts before going in.  In addition to the workouts, I got up at 5am everyday to do 1 hour of yoga next to my bunk, 20 minutes of tai chi, 20 minutes of pranayama breathing exercises, and 30 minutes of meditation.  I would make an effort to walk for at least an hour per day (we were in a dorm setup with a common area which I would pace around the perimter)

My workouts generally looked like this:

Day 1 - Upper Body

Pullups - 10 sets of 10 reps (increased over time to 14-15 reps)
Handstand Pushups - 6 sets of 6 reps (increased over time to 10-12 reps)
Pushups - initially 10 sets of 25 reps, increased over time to 4 sets of 20 reps one-handed, 6 sets of 35 reps normal
Bodyweight Row (used dip station, had someone hold me legs up) - 6 sets of 15 reps
Dips - 6 sets of 15 reps

Day 2 - Lower Body + 5x40 Burpees (burpees done in a separate workout -- usually first thing in the morning then the lower body workout done later in the day)

10 rounds as fast as possible: 25 jump squats, 10 lunges (each leg), 12 pistol squats (each leg)
It took a while to work up to this workout.  My goal heading in was to get good at pistols, which I couldn't do a single one of when heading in.  My initial workout looked like this:
8 sets of 30 squats, 20 lunges, 4 'assisted pistols' (held onto the side of a bunk or some object to brace me as I descended...gradually worked my way into doing pistols without holding anything).  I stuck with this workout for about 2.5 months before moving onto the 10 round timed workout.

Day 3 - Abs / Lower Back + 5x40 Burpees (burpees done first thing in AM, other workout later)
10 sets of 12 reps hanging leg raise
10 sets of 20 reps back extension (had access to simple back extension setup when moved to state prison)
6 sets of 40 situps
6 sets of 12 back bridges (Convict conditioning style...full bridge from ground)
4 sets of 20 ab wheel rollouts (had access to ab wheel in state prison gym)
4 sets of 2 reps 'wall walks' -- stand in front of a wall and arch backwards, walking hands along the wall into a full bridge

Day 4 - Upper Body
Pullups - 10 sets of 10 reps (increased over time to 14-15 reps)
Handstand Pushups - 6 sets of 6 reps (increased over time to 10-12 reps)
Pushups - initially 10 sets of 25 reps, increased over time to 4 sets of 20 reps one-handed, 6 sets of 35 reps normal
Bodyweight Row (used dip station, had someone hold me legs up) - 6 sets of 15 reps
Dips - 6 sets of 15 reps

Day 5 - Lower Body + 5x40 Burpees

10 rounds as fast as possible: 25 jump squats, 10 lunges (each leg), 12 pistol squats (each leg)
It took a while to work up to this workout.  My goal heading in was to get good at pistols, which I couldn't do a single one of when heading in.  My initial workout looked like this:

Day 6 - Abs /Lower Back + 5x40 Burpees
10 sets of 12 reps hanging leg raise
10 sets of 20 reps back extension (had access to simple back extension setup when moved to state prison)
6 sets of 40 situps
6 sets of 12 back bridges (Convict conditioning style...full bridge from ground)
4 sets of 20 ab wheel rollouts (had access to ab wheel in state prison gym)
4 sets of 2 reps 'wall walks' -- stand in front of a wall and arch backwards, walking hands along the wall into a full bridge

Day 7 - Rest

Nutrition:

This was my biggest concern going in.  Meals in prison tend to be very high in carbohydrates and very little nutritional value.  I had been seeing some success with the LeanGains style of eating, so I incorporated that into my eating when in prison by skipping breakfast.  Lunch was served at 11:30am and usually consisted of 2 cups of macaroni or starchy pasta with some sort of 'slop' - chunks of meat in sauce, 2 slices of bread, a small carton of milk, and a cup of vegetables.  Dinner was a similar setup and served at 4:30pm.  Fortunately I had access to commissary, and with a $75 per week spending limit, I loaded up on tuna (25 g protein), mackeral (18 g protein), protein shake packets (238 calories, 44 protein, 22 carb), oatmeal, and beef crumbles (275 calories, 38 g protein).  I would take a few packets of meat with me to each meal in order to add protein.  So for example at lunch I would add 2 packets of tuna to the 'slop', and eat only one cup of the carbs.  Outside of the cafeteria the only tools I had to cook with were hot water, so I could make oatmeal, instant rice, and a few other things. Often I would add a third meal closer in the evening to add additional protein and because dinner was served so early....usually something like 2 packets of meat and a small cup of instant brown rice.

In keeping with the LeanGains style of eating, I would increase calories a little on the upper body and lower body training days, with my postworkout meal being the largest and the most carbs.  Sometimes I would be working out at night (after dinner), so my go to postworkout meal was 3 packets of instant oatmeal with 2 packets of protein powder.  This workout out to about 800 calories, 88 g protein, 125 g carbs.  I would also cycle carbs and calories lower on ab/lower back days and rest days while keeping protein intake around 180g.  Typically my postworkout meal would be the highest in carbs, and for the other meals I would skip the high carb options but giving away my macaroni and bread or trading it for a carton of milk.

Sample Day of eating (train in AM):

Lunch:

2 cups of macaroni, 2 packets of tuna + 'meat slop', 2 slices white bread, 1 milk, 1 cup veggies

Dinner:

2 packets of meat + 'meat slop', 2 slices white bread, 1 milk, 1 cup veggies

Additional meal: 2 packets of tuna + cup of instant brown rice

Summary:

Was able to maintain a lot of strength overall and improve my bodyweight conditioning significantly.  I am more cut up than I've ever been, having lost a total of 20 lbs and now being able to see veins in my abdomen.  The biggest takeaway is that going forward I will be eating much less, realizing how much better it feels to be leaner and more conditioned.  I will soon be testing my 1 rep maxes in the four main lifts to see how the bodyweight strength carries over into barbell work after having not touched weights in 4 months.",,False,,t5_2qhx4,1370008383.0,,,True,t3_1feaxe,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1feaxe/results_4_months_prison_beforeafter_pics_inside/,

It was clearly his first time there as he didn't seem like he knew what he was doing, which is fine I ain't hating. He sits in the hammer strength chest press machine and it is already loaded with 45lb plates. I see him attempt to push it but he cannot do so. He was clearly struggling and after a few more seconds he gave up and just stood up attempting to remove the plates from the machine. I would have gone over and helped him but I am by no means a ""big"" guy so I do not feel comfortable approaching people and giving advice to them unless what they are doing could harm themselves or others. I just stood there doing my workout and looking back and knowing that feels of being new and not being able to lift a lot. As the kid was struggling to pull off the plates, 2 huge guys approached him and told him to sit back into the machine. The 2 guys then started pep talking the kid and saying don't worry we got you just try your hardest. And with that motivation he pushed and the 2 guys helped and he started doing it! As if that wasn't good enough the 2 guys let go after a few reps and the kid continued to press without their help. As soon as he was done he was so happy with himself you could see him glow. I felt happy for him and it really shows that not everyone at the gym is a complete douche bag.

They brought along 5 people from their office, who stood in a semi-circle behind and around the squat rack, all the way to the side-rail of the rack I was in. After watching them pound out single 1/2 squats in increasing weights up to 365 lbs (alright, I was impressed he pushed that, though he did YELL AT TOP VOLUME WHILE DOING SO) while working through my 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sets, they finished their competition and *walked away.* I about lost it. I turn to the closest member of the group, who happened to be a very nicely dressed woman (though the entire group heard), and asked ""are y'all going to re-rack those weights?"" To which she replied a very abrupt ""no."" Even after calling them out on it, I still had to say ""let me rephrase, re-rack the damned weights."" Now all 7 of them are looking at me like I'm retarded (I'm 6'4"" 225 and only just starting SL and concentrating on form, so I was squatting 145) so I followed up with ""you're man enough to lift it, but not enough to put it away? It's really rude to leave your weights up there, what if the next person wanting to use that rack is a 95 pound woman? She would then have to re-rack all of YOUR weight."" Only then did two guys go and re-rack the weights, one of whom wasn't even one of the guys lifting. I hate people.

**TL;DR** Assholes trade off squatting to 365, leave weight on bar. When confronted, look at me like I'm stupid until I ridicule them into doing the right thing.

So if you're ever wanting food and thinking ""man, I'm hungry, my body needs energy so I should at least eat something,"" stop and ask yourself: could I go for some broccoli now, or do I just want pizza? (or any other type of food that likely isn't good for you). If broccoli is sounding really good right about now, you are actually hungry. If it isn't, then chances are you're just craving something.

Thank you so much for all the kind words and support! It really makes me feel good. Here is some background regarding the process. I'm 5'3"" and was legitimately addicted to food. Fast food was my intake 4 times a day. The first week I found myself crying into my chicken nuggets at a Wendy's. My first focus was on portion control and I invested in lean cuisines. I then transitioned away from processed foods and began cooking at home and eating whole foods. I changed my workout routine every few months but began with walking on my treadmill at home. After the first 20lbs I got a gym membership and began cycling and kickboxing classes then transitioned away from the gym and got myself outdoors. Now I jog and dance almost everyday, play soccer every week and swim. My future goals are lowering my bodyfat percentage through cardio and diet so that I can begin leangains. I know it's difficult for women to bulk but I would really like to put on as much muscle as I can and am patiently waiting for the fatloss period to end so that I may start my strength training journey.

For a year and a half I worked at a major national gym, as well as my own training business.  As far as I know, most of the large corporate gyms are more or less the same as far as how they treat clients.  Obviously, there are some differences and some are worse than others.  I have also taught group classes, coached high school basketball/volleyball, and was briefly the athletic trainer for a professional basketball team in Bangkok.  I had a great rapport with all my clients, dealt with them honestly, and after I became aware of unscrupulous activity no longer accepted clients from the sales team.  Since then I will never train for one of these corporate gyms, nor will I allow them to earn any revenue from any of my actions, directly or indirectly.

The Sales Process: 

In most situations the sales team and the personal training personnel are two completely different departments in the gym.  Sales persons feed the training staff new clients and are paid commission as long as they hit their target quota, if the quota isn’t met they are paid minimum wage.  Sales can be quite lucrative, however if the target isn’t hit, they are essentially working 12 hour days 6 days a week for about 8 bucks an hour.  With that being said the Sales team is under ridiculous pressure to sell training sessions, and often time shady practices are undertaken.  Additionally, and even more unsettling; they are in no way required to be certified, and are seldom qualified to give any sort of health related advice.  Yet, with no clinical information they will tell you, you are in imminent danger of heart disease.  They will be hyper critical of your weight and ask you how much weight you want to lose before you are comfortable with yourself.  They will say just about anything to make you feel like you need training.  Most gyms will offer a “free consultation from a personal trainer” in order to rope you into a contract.  9 times out of 10 the person leading this “consultation” was not a personal trainer, nor was the interaction a real consultation.  In general, They would start off with an arbitrary method of body fat measurement: BMI index, tape measure or bioelectrical impedance (the cheap little body fat machine you hold in your hand);  all three methods being the least accurate in terms of giving an accurate reading.  Usually the one that gives the most advantageous (whichever makes you fattest) reading is used.  They were instructed by management to tell potential clients they need to reach unhealthy and unrealistic goals; for example, a good target goal for a woman of 27% body fat is 8% (whereby 27% is average and can be healthy, and 8% is anorexic and dangerous).  After the consultation they move on to a training session, which at my gym jovially referred to as “hazing”.  This being a horribly unsafe means of pushing a potential client to their limits (again with no reference to their prior medical history) in order to show them that they cannot exercise on their own and they are grossly out of shape.  It also was not uncommon for the sales person to flat out lie about the terms and rates of a training contract; Really, you need to be on your guard because in general, the sales person is under a ton of pressure to sell, and there are institutional problems that encourage unethical behavior.  

Personal Training:

The minimum qualification for a personal trainer to work at many of these major corporate gyms is a personal training certification.  Depending on the gym this can range from a cert. that can be obtained online in under two weeks, to a certification that takes 3-6 months to prepare for.  I personally have a NASM certification, and is regarded as one of the best.  However, this is not at all sufficient in terms of assessing one’s knowledge.  The major problem with this particular certification is that NASM has a profit motive, meaning they make more money by selling more tests.  There is an economic advantage to having people fail; a lower pass rate implies a more prestigious cert. and obviously people pay to retake the exam.  Personally, found that the exam focused way too much on semantics rather than assessing knowledge of the body and training.  Ideally, I’d like to see a governing body without a profit motive certifying personal trainers.  The fact is, training is can be a very dangerous business.  If your trainer is unqualified or under qualified, there is way too much potential to make existing health problems worse or develop new ones or create new or exacerbate existing muscle imbalances.  Far too often I saw my colleagues guiding their clients through exercises incorrectly or having them do things that were extremely compromising to the body structurally.  

Nutrition:

Personal Trainers, are, in general, not qualified to give nutritional or supplement advice.  We are not nutritionists and should not be advising (outside of basic nutritional knowledge) unless we have some sort of history in nutrition.  We do not have access to your medical history, and even if we did there’s no guarantee that we’d give you proper advice.  This fact is especially disturbing when giving supplement advice (some trainers at gyms are required to sell supplements and have monthly quotas).  This is extremely frightening given many supplements can affect heart functioning and have very little government oversight in terms of safety.  

Contractual issues pertaining to my gym:

Far too often, clients are overcharged.  My gym only offered 30 minute sessions, and depending on the sale or promotion the price ranged from $20-60/session.  Which means clients were paying 40-120 dollars an hour for often times, under qualified training.  I personally charged 30-40 for my private clients, which was an average rate for my area.  From each session the trainer would take $8; and are effectively making 15 dollars an hour taxed.  Unfortunately, when many of my colleagues became aware of this discrepancy (at times the gym could net 112 vs. the trainers’ 8 per session) they’d become disgruntled and take it out on their clients either with attitude or providing terrible service.  Canceling memberships or training was always a ridiculous hassle.  In order to cancel, clients were required to physically mail notification to the corporate office and the vast majority of the time, the notice would get “lost” ensuring another months of sessions/membership.  If there was no notification, they would continue to charge members’ credit cards, even after the contract period.  And of course, the contract rarely agreed with what the sales person promised.  

Other problems:

There were also a number of instances where a few “bad apple” trainers/sales persons would steal, overcharge or participate in some sort of illegal activity against clients/members.  I understand that these are actions taken on the part of individuals, but the gym  could have tightened their internal controls or taken other measures to prevent these things from happening.  The problem is, unethical and dishonest behavior is indirectly encouraged from the top down within the corporation and in my experience is far too prevalent in the industry.

Things to do to protect yourself:

1.	Always ask your trainer/sales person their background.  It’s not rude at all.  It is your body they are working with and your health at risk, you have every right to know their qualifications.
2.	Try to pay with cash whenever you can.  This prevents them from charging you past the contract period, and from overcharging you.  If a gym says you cannot, chances are they are being dishonest and I’d call their bluff.
3.	If possible ask a trainer if they’ll train you independent of a gym contract, you’ll pay less money and they’ll earn more.
4.	Always ask for a copy of your contract and read it.  Generally there’s a buyer’s remorse period and you can get out with very little penalty.  It’s generally company policy to not give you a copy unless you ask, something about it being better for the environment to go paperless.  
5.	If you have questions r/fitness, and even more so r/askscience are great resources,  both are smart communities and it’s always a great idea to have people crosschecking each other.  
6.	Don’t take any shit from sales people, if they are willing to bully you chances are they don’t know what they are talking about, the gym is no place for bullying; if anything you should be encouraged.  

I’ll be around for a while, and am open and happy to answer any questions or clarify anything

TL;DR
1.	Sales people are dishonest and not qualified to tell you what you need
2.	Often times trainers are under qualified 
3.	Suggestions to help you from getting screwed.

I'm a long-time lurker of this wonderful subreddit, and yesterday, for one of the first times in my life, I was feeling fit, so I figured it was time to share my progress. 

Pics first:

I'm 5'10, 23 years old, and I started off at approximately 225 pounds. Last time I managed to weigh myself, in May, I was 175, but I've lost a few more inches since then, so it's likely I've lost a bit more weight too. My starting measurements were 46-36-46, and now I'm down to 37-29-39, so I've basically lost at least 7 inches in my circumference this year! (My dress size dropped from a size 16/18 to a size 8/10, and I've even fit into some size 6s, albeit less flatteringly.)

[me holding the measuring tape where it used to be](http://i.imgur.com/zjCO0.png)

I started lurking on fittit/loseit last June, and seeing normal people achieving extraordinary things really kick-started my journey. I decided to make exercise and my fitness a priority, and committed to doing it AT LEAST every 2 days, often more. I had to start slow, because, well, as my pictures would suggest I was extremely sedentary and obese. 

I use the TRX (www.trxtraining.com), which uses your body weight for strength training. I use it at home, which means no excuses not to do it, which was one of my biggest issues; working out from home helped me keep up my routine long-term. However, it is an expensive system for what it is. I had been previously introduced to it through my old kickboxing gym and got it on sale (they generally offer 25% around Christmastime), but there's a LOT of suspension trainer DIY tutorials online that you should check out if suspension training interests you. In terms of cardio exercise, I walk a lot more (and enjoy spending hours going on walks), take the stairs (and walk up escalators), bike a lot in the summer. I'm much more into building muscle (I get really excited to show people I haven't seen for awhile my new biceps, for example!). 

I took the advice ""eat less, move more"" to heart, and while I don't count calories, I do eat significantly smaller portions, and less junk food overall. I buy a lot more fruits and veggies, but I don't deprive myself of the things I'm craving. 

I've still got a bit more to lose, probably around 10-15 pounds, but these are more vanity pounds off my stomach and thighs than anything. I'm basically at a healthy BMI (1-2 pounds over last time I checked my weight in May), and I'm starting to feel good about my body and fitness. I'm currently stalling with my weight loss (but am still losing inches very slowly, so I can't reaaally call it a plateau). I'm considering intermittent fasting to take my diet to the next level and lose these last pounds. Also, if anyone has words of wisdom or advice about IF, I'd be much obliged!

The goal of this is to get huge and get bitches. You definitely want to be lifting as big as posssible without gaining any fat.  Most people will set a goal in the 20-30lbs of muscle gained and aim for about 6% body fat over the first semester. 

Here's the program:

**Workout drink**:
Muscle milk in a shaker bottle.  

**Warm up**:
Cardio machine for 20 mins. Middle row machine or behind the best yoga pants.  Don't sweat too much in case you see some ladies to talk to.

**Lifts / Reps / Weight**:

* **Smith Machine Squats** / 2x20 / just the bar (don't want the legs to get too big so you can get that V taper!)
* **Squat Rack Curls** / 4 sets to failure / heaviest weight you can get. (Gotta build those guns)
* **Barbell Bench Press** / 3 sets at 1RM / get your max on the bar so people dont make fun of you. its a psychological thing.
* **""Skinny Indian Guy"" Psychokinetic Chest Press** / 4 mins / No weight. You do this exercise by putting your body weight in plates on the hammer tech machine (about 120 lbs) and then staring at it while slouching. Don't worry, you will figure out how it works eventually. In the meantime you can psych yourself up.
* **Dumbell Rack Dumbell Curls** / 2 sets to fail / Find a weight you can do 12 reps with then add 15 lbs to that. Make sure to get as close to the rack as possible. Gotta be alpha and claim your spot in the gym, while u build those guns bro!
* **Conversation Curls** / 1 min or 3 sentences / Find the biggest dude in the gym and try to talk to him while he's deadlifting. For the advanced version ask him how long until he's done when he's in the middle of his set.
* **Cable Machine** / 3 sets 12 reps / find any cable machine and pull on it for a little while. Make sure to get some protein in.
* **Arched Back Deadlift** / 2 sets 5 reps or to injury / Add an extra plate onto the bar so you can get big quicker. Don't worry about form, just make sure it gets off the ground
* **Standing Dumbbell Bicep Curls** / 2 sets 10 reps / use one size smaller than u did for Rack Dumbbell Curls since this is for hypertrophy. Arms are the first thing a woman sees.
* **Crunches** / Do about 50 on the exercise ball next to the cardio machines so you can be seen.

**Diet:**

U will see a lot of diet advice on the internet but just ignore it because 1. u don't wanna get too fat and 2. you gotta be able to account for the Natty Light at the house parties. What u wanna do is get almost entirely protein. So buy two tubs of muscle milk when the loan check arrives and then supplement with casein. Don't use creatine cause it will make you bloated! Your fat will come from pizza and just assume that your carbs will come from any alcohol calories. 

**Gym etiquette**:

1. Never take your sunglasses off. You have to keep from being distracted and the women won't know you're staring
2. If someone takes more than 30 seconds after a set they're probably done with that equipment so you can go ahead and move their stuff.
3. Unused incline benches are the perfect place to sit and talk to your friends.
4. ENJOY THE MIRIN BITCHES AND GETTING HUGE!! 

**Resources**:
Pretty much anything on Bodybuilding.com supplements section is going to be a good choice. Just make sure to always keep that body fat below 6%. ALWAYS CUT BEFORE YOU BULK! This is pragmatic because the best parties are in the fall so you don't have time to turn into a fat fuck if you are going to get laid.

I've had an issue with my weight my entire life. Last year Jan2012 it was at its worst. I was over 250lbs and 1/3 of my body was fat, I knew something had to change. I got really motivated and dropped 60lbs in six months... I started to run and eat right during the week and tried my best on the weekends. The weight started shedding off and I kept true to my regiment no matter what. I was in great shape before I even knew it. When I started running (250lbs), I threw up after my first 1/2 mile run. Gradually I worked my distance up until I hit my longest run at 9 miles. I just hope this serves as inspiration to most, in a non-narcissistic kind of way. If you set your mind entirely to something, then you can and will succeed. Don't sit around and let things bother you, FIX THEM

WEIGHT LOSS [-64lbs]:
Jan 2012- (253lbs)
        to
June 2012- (189lbs)  

DIET: Low Caloric and Low carb whenever I hit a plateau 
I didn't have a set diet regiment, I would eat boiled eggs every morning... it sucked but I had to. For lunch I'd pack a turkey sandwich w/ WHEAT bread and some fruit and veggies. For dinner I would just have whatever my parents made. 

ROUTINE: Diet doesn't matter so much when you're burning a crap ton of calories. I ran long distance to keep my heart rate elevated for long intervals and increased my mile distance weekly. Directly after running I would go immediately to the gym. I just did my thing in the gym. 
Mon- Chest, Triceps, Inner/Outter thighs, Neck, Abs... Tues- Back, Biceps, Quads, and Calfs... Weds- Shoulder, Traps, Lats, Lower back, Hamstrings, Abs.... Thur- I'd targeted specific areas I felt were being neglected. That's pretty much it...

This project took me three months to complete (keep in mind I have a day job and a wife and kids so this project was done in my free time!)

Next goal? The 1000 lb club!


**EDIT**

You can find most of my answers to questions in the comments below, but I just wanted to add a FAQ to answer some common questions that were posted in the comments. 

* How much did it all cost?

Some of the equipment (the treadmill, elliptical, and bench) were bought years ago. If memory serves the treadmill was ~$1500 and the elliptical was ~$800. The bench is just a cheap one that I bought last year for $200, I will be replacing it with a Body-solid Incline/decline bench soon. The power rack with the lat attachment and 210 lb weight stack was $1200, the dip/leg lift station was $330, the ab board was $260. The Bowflex SelectTech 1090s were $600 + $130 for the stand. The Olympic bar, weight tree, and 350 lbs of olympic weights was around $700. The PC was ~$500, the corner PC desk was $100, and the 5.1 receiver (wt. speakers included) was $350. The TV was ""borrowed"" from another room in the house :) On to the room itself, the flooring was ~$700, it's a quality laminate (I wanted laminate instead of hardwood as it's much easier to lay and it's much more durable). I have all my receipts for the room materials, etc, but I can't really get into the detailed breakdown of the room costs because it would take too long but overall it cost around $12K to complete the room from start to finish with all equipment and furnishings.

* How are you going to Deadlift without breaking the floor?

The floor sits on a concrete slab, so I don't have to worry about the weight. I will do as many suggested and pick up a few heavy rubber mats, and double or even triple them up to protect the floor.

* How do you learn a skill like this/are you a contractor?

It came fairly naturally to me. I just always loved working with wood and I'm rather methodical so it's right up my alley. In the past I've built many rooms (bedrooms, offices, etc.), a playground for my kids, an elaborate deck off my house in my back yard, etc. I'm not a contractor, I just really enjoy this kind of stuff.

* Why no mirrors?

In time. Just haven't had the chance to get any yet.

* How do you manage overhead press, push presses, etc. with such low ceilings?

I don't :( Unfortunately I am somewhat limited in what I can do with this space as it's only 7'9"" tall. So I have to settle with seated military/overhead presses instead of standing. Also, while pull-ups can be done on the rack, I have a separate pull-up bar in an adjacent room that has no drywall so it gives me a bit more clearance.


That's all for now. If any other questions arise I will add those. Thank you all for your kind words, it is *really* appreciated, and I hope this inspires some of you to build a dream gym of your own.

Anyway, today I said t'hell with the gains, got up two hours early and started riding. Its supposed to be squat/ohp/deadlift day today, but that can wait. 

It was an absolutely fucking beautiful morning, the country roads were almost deserted, I got to watch the sun rise over picturesque field's while riding over rivers and by farms and sheep and flocks of sleeping geese.

",2870,1402,1198,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1alg3b/some_thoughts_regarding_a_date_i_had_with_an/,"I met someone over Plenty of Fish recently, she's a smart, funny lawyer. I'd seen her photo and knew she wasn't in the best shape, but I though, what the hell, she seems awesome so I might as well meet her and see where it goes. So we go out for dinner and we hit it off over a bottle of wine, which we inevitably sneak out of the restaurant and drive over to her hotel. We're sitting on her bed drinking, and all of a sudden I realize that I'm not physically attracted to her. She's bigger than me, much, like her hips are 3 times that of my own. She's also a bit taller, but that's not that big of a deal. Anyways, all of a sudden I realize that I'm not at all feeling any sexual desire, and I can't escape that. She brings up several times throughout the night how she does Pilates and exercises on her Wii... and I think to myself, *fuck, Pilates and Wii? If I were in her shoes I'd be doing HIIT on the treadmill, I'd be cutting all sugars and unnecessary calories from my diet, I'd sell that Wii fit board and replace it with a regular gym pass, I'd learn real ways  to lose weight fast and replace it with firm muscle mass.*

Then I wonder, when did I start thinking like this? Am I an ass for thinking this? Here I have this great girl who is super into me, she's got a brilliant career, she's funny, and very charismatic. Yet, I can't get over the fact that she's very very out of shape and doesn't seem to take it seriously.

Not long after I thanked her for the great night and left. She was visibly disappointed, I think she understood that I wasn't feeling it, despite her being very direct with her advances. After a few days of thinking about this, I've come to realize how my own daily efforts at the gym have shaped the way I perceive myself and others. I don't devalue them, nor to I overvalue myself, however I've come to realize that the discipline I've developed affects me in various parts of my life, not just in fitness. It helps me eat well, not just well, but fucking amazingly. It helps me sleep better, and consequently wake up feeling energetic and ready for my days. It helps me focus at work (granted, I'm writing this at work at the moment), and it helps me be an active and outdoorsy person. I want someone who I can share these elements of life with, and being with someone because of their career and because they are funny just won't cut it. I need someone disciplined and who is ready to take responsibility for their health. They don't need to be bikini models, far from it, but they should at least take it a bit more seriously than Wii Fit. 

In the end, I don't think I'm a dick or pretentious or arrogant. I earnestly believe that I'm just holding out to meet someone who has similar standards and priorities as myself. I was honest with the girl about how I felt, but I didn't bring up the fitness thing, I just said that I didn't feel an emotional connection. We're still very good friends, because you can't fake the way we got along so well. A part of me feels as though I might have made a mistake, that a person's body will eventually fade and what will remain is your ability to get along with them (which we did, and continue to very well). But again, I just don't see myself being with someone who cannot take their physical health seriously anymore. 

**TL;DR: Met a girl over POF, had a date, had a chance to close the deal, backed off because I wasn't attracted to her. Had a few days of personal soul-searching, came to the conclusion that I have to be true to myself.**

**EDIT**
So it seems that I'm getting a lot of 'you just weren't attracted to her' and a lot of 'you're an ass and you should feel bad'. Either I'm right or I'm wrong, which leads me to believe that I'm right to be confused about my decision and have mixed feelings about it. I don't feel good that I walked away from something potentially great, but I'm also a bit relieved to have listened to my instincts and done what I felt was right. I wasn't attracted to her physically, and in a roundabout way that led to me finding justifications for walking. I am and continue to be very attracted to her other aspects of her personality, and that makes me feel really bad for not giving myself a chance to get to know that side better. We agreed to stay in each other's lives, and continue to message back and forth over facebook (even openly admitting that it's better now that we know where we stand), and somehow I feel incredibly bitter sweet about the whole thing. 

I'm glad I opened up this discussion, it was good to get all different sides and opinions. I'm sorry if a lot of you think I'm an ass or a jerk or insert $#@% here, I understand where you're coming from. I guess I just wanted to air this out a bit, see what everyone thought, and use what I learn to help make decisions in the future.

**Training**

* Squat: I was really struggling to make progress on squatting with 5/3/1, so I went back to the basics, resetting to 225 and starting SS from there (thanks suppy). I made it to about 275x3x5 before I started to stall and switched to TM, which is an amazingly effective program. I made it to a [pretty ugly 350x5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TWj_uQalc4) before I mentally couldn't keep up with two intense squatting sessions per week (especially since it's summer, which means lots of cycling / basketball / doing fun stuff outside). 

* Bench/OHP: Straightforward 5/3/1 BBB the entire year. I've heard a lot of people say that benching or pressing once per week isn't enough to make progress, but I haven't run into any troubles yet (although my bench is nothing to be proud of). 

* Deadlift: In theory I've been doing 5/3/1, but with all the squatting I was doing with SS/TM I've probably averaged about one deadlifting session per month in the past year, if that. However, my DL has gone up a lot, probably due to the effects of squatting. I'm planning to try running 5/3/1 for both squat and DL at the same time to see if I can get anywhere.

* Accessories: I do weighted chins and rows about once per week each. That along with the BBB sets are the only accessory work I ever do. Recently started doing some push presses for the fun of it.

**Other exercise**

* Cycling: I did a lot of cycling last fall (probably a big factor in why my squat wasn't progressing back then), with a longest [ride of 100km](http://app.strava.com/activities/25570596). I've ridden about 2500 miles in the past year, a lot of which is 10 miles / day commuting to work.

* Basketball / tennis recreationally

**Diet**

[Weight over time](http://i.imgur.com/tvMAaQH.png) (each tick at the bottom is 3 months, with the vertical line the beginning of 2013). Ate at a surplus for most of the year, with the exception of cutting to make weight for the meet (see link at the top). High protein and carbs; pretty standard stuff.

**Goals**

I've measured progress as outlined in [this post](http://www.leangains.com/2011/09/fuckarounditis.html):

* Strength Goals: Intermediate -- ""Within two years of consistent training on a decent routine, the average male should be able to progress to the following levels of strength (1RM): Bench press: BWx1.2, Chin-ups: BWx1.2, Squat: BWx1.6, Deadlift: BWx2"" **DONE**

* Strength Goals: Advanced -- ""3 out of 4 of the following goals should be reached within five years: Bench press: BWx1.5, Chin-ups: BWx1.5, Squat: BWx2, Deadlift: BWx2.5"" [I could probably do chins or get close (never tried 1rm before), squat is close, and bench/DL feel a long ways away]

I'm hoping to hit Advanced in the next year or so. At current bodyweight, that would mean 300/400/500 bench/squat/DL.

I went for a run this afternoon. Running is definitely not my strong suit - I have pretty severe asthma and, generally, very little endurance. Nonetheless, I wanted to get up off my butt and decided that there's only one way to get better - practice.

I started jogging around my college's campus, and really decided to push myself today. After a little while of running nonstop, I felt like I was ready for a rest. Then, another runner came around the corner, jogging towards me. 

As she passed, she smiled and gave me a 'thumbs up' sign, and mouthed the words ""good job"". I was too winded to do anything but smile back, but that little thumbs up gave me the encouragement I needed to finish another three blocks before stopping for a walk break.

A year and a half ago I got engaged. We had been together 10 years and this was a great motivator for me to sort myself out! I knew I was very overweight and, although I wasn't too happy about it, it didn't seem the end of the world. Then, when I thought about the Wedding I realised I did have big issues with my weight and it was time to get myself into a more healthy state. I started calorie counting, aiming for a 2lb loss a week. The weight came off pretty easily and this motivated me to continue. Since then I have become quite into fitness and do alot of swimming, running and weight training. I have been working with a personal trainer for about a year and I have now reached my weight goal. I have to say that I felt amazing on our Wedding day and got so many compliments. I was a dress size 18/20 (UK -US 14/16) and am now a size 8 (UK - US 4). I will definately be continuing with the training. I am a changed person. My outlook on life has changed. At first I just did the exercise to lose weight, but I have since become hooked!

http://i.imgur.com/QM7pe.jpg - after


Update re: my diet and exercise routine. Diet wise I worked out my maintenance calories with -1000. At the beginning this was about 1700 cals per day. The aim was for 200 cals exercise per day (on average). To be honest I wasn't in a too bad state for my size. I was reasonably active and aerobically wasn't too bad (relatively) due to many years of playing a brass instrument so I was okay with doing exercise. At first I started going on walks (3/4/5/6 miles). Then I started swimming again (did this alot as a kid). I went before work and did about 1/2 a mile each day. This continued for about 6 months then I decided I should go to the gym. As soon as I started going I hired a trainer there; mainly because I really had no idea what to do. I knew I should be doing weight training, but wanted to do it properly. From this point I introduced training sessions of 1 hour per week with the trainer and then doing some stuff on my own. These were based on using kettlebells, bodyweight exercises, deadlifts etc. About 6 months ago I started running. Now I usually do 2 x 1hr sessions with my trainer. Then I swim 4 x a week (1/2 mile). In addition I usually do 1 or 2 more sessions of either running or weight training; whatever takes my fancy. In terms of food I would stick within the calorie allowance, but do eat a variety of foods. I don't do low-carb, but generally eat little bread. I eat alot of fresh vegetables and fruit. We have our own allotment garden and grow much ourselves. This is also good exercise! A typical day for me would be oats for breakfast with honey and banana, lunch: homemade soup, some fruit, boiled egg and greek yoghurt. Dinner stir fry with veg, chicken and small portion of rice.

Here is another picture of a close up on my face not long ago http://i.imgur.com/LeXoI.jpg
hopefully this proves that it is the same person for those that don't believe it.

Now that I'm at the weight that I would like to be around, I have been focusing on strength building for the past 5 weeks.

I forgot to add what my diet and training were like

My diet consistently is eating several times throughout the day with small snacks.

My main meals were typically this:

**Breakfast**: protein shake with a half cup of oatmeal

**Lunch**: usually a sandwich with turkey or chicken and loaded with veggies

**Dinner**: Is almost always something different so it's hard to say what exactly but usually would incorporate half veggies, with a sweet potato and a small fillet of salmon, chicken, or lean beef.

Throughout the day I have 2-3 protein shakes and will usually have some homemade toast or banana bread to get some sugars.

**Before Bed**: I will typically have a bowl of Fiber 1 before bed to get extra fiber as well as to fill me up with some carbs, as I can't really sleep when hungry. I usually will also have something with casein protein in it, or yogurt.


My training routine has recently changed. Through out the summer I mainly focused on road biking usually going distances ~50km and sometimes up to ~100km on Sundays or randomly through out the week. Towards the end of summer I started to transfer into the gym doing mainly isolation workouts with extreme intensity, around 30 second rests.

As I stated in the original post I am now focusing mainly on strength building and my routine is one that I made myself with lots of information from other ones

**Monday and Thursday**: Squats, dead lifts, stiff legged dead lifts, hamstring curl, calves.
I'll typically throw in different variations or other things in there but the core squats and dead lifts all ways.

**Tuesday, and Friday**: I do upper body Bench press or dumbbell press, bench pullovers, military press or standing press, wide grip pull ups, dips, and barbell rows. Also with this I'll throw in different things as well.

**Saturday or Sunday**: I'll usually do around a 3-5km run just to keep my cardio up.

I don't really believe in cheat days, as I truly enjoy my diet and find it very easy to eat the food and maintain it. Every now and then though I'll eat out at a restaurant or order a pizza but this isn't very common.

**Edit:** Some people were asking about the biking, luckily I have an activity log I took when I started using the app called Strava. I only started using this towards I believe early to mid August. http://i.imgur.com/XGRR6.png

I finished my set and look up at him and he straight away introduced himself, shook my hand, and asked if he could correct my form. I was really surprised, and said yes straight away because I had no idea if I was even doing it properly. He showed me how to do it, explained what muscles this exercise works on and even demonstrated for me.

THEN... he started asking me how long I'd been going to the gym, why I was going to the gym, and what I hoped to get out of it in the end. We had a nice chat and he gave me advice, then he offered to show me some other exercises. I took him up on his offer and asked him to show me how to do squats. So he spent the next 20 minutes slowly explaining, demonstrating, watching me squat, correcting me and all that stuff. It was the best gym session I had ever done and I was so excited I finally learned how to do squats (BTW, squats feel so fucking good. My whole body felt like it was getting a workout!).

After all this, he then asked if I wanted a free one-on-one session with him. He said he'll go through any exercise I want, write up a personal weekly workout plan and give me advice on diet as well.

I can't even describe how over the moon I am. I've been going to the gym for about 3 months now. I haven't got a set schedule; I just turn up and do what I feel like, not knowing if I was doing anything right. I've always wanted to learn how to do squats, dead-lift, bench press etc but I have no friends who go to this gym who can show me and I'm already signed up for a 12 month contract (also too scared to ask random people in the gym). I feel like now I can actually get a proper routine going and really build my strength.

I'm pretty damn excited to be going to the gym now!

Edit: Lots of people are wondering this, but I am a guy.

Edit 2: I guess I'm kinda surprised at all the negative comments regarding not using the FAQ, YouTube, other forums etc in order to learn. I can tell you that when I did want to know something, I went straight to the FAQ, then YouTube to watch how certain exercises are done. However, I'm not the kind of person who can visually see an exercise, then confidently and comfortably do it myself. I'd be way too worried about doing it wrong the first time, then always doing it wrong. I wouldn't be sure if my feet were wide enough, whether I was sticking my bum out enough or whatever. The small things that you need people to observe you doing from the outside.

Also, I apologise if in some of my comments I came across as sounding like I was taking advantage of the guy by going to the free session then not paying for anymore. I will make it very clear to him that I can't afford it, and if he was expecting another paying client, then I simply won't do the free session.

1356791180.0,1414,self.Fitness,15mi1s,How to Welcome the Thousands of new people who are going to come to /r/fitness in the next few weeks,2192,778,356,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/15mi1s/how_to_welcome_the_thousands_of_new_people_who/,"If you don't know, this is a partial [re-post of the same discussion we had last year](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/nuzzk/how_to_welcome_the_thousands_of_new_people_who/). 

If you've been reading [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) for more than a year, then you already know that one of our busiest times is New Years.  It's when resolutions kick in, and a lot of people new to fitness come here to help get a good start.  

We love new community members here!  So many of our old community members came here with almost no knowledge of fitness, learned from this community, and got fit.  

At the end of 2011, we had 107,000 members,  and now we have 247,000.  That means for almost 60% of you, this has been your first year on /r/fitness.    So if this is your first year of New Year's resolutioners, here's a bit of background to help you welcome them.  

* If you're patrolling the new queue, it's important that you read each submission carefully.  While, at first glance, it may appear that the submission is merely ""typical"" (""I'm a 19 year old male, 5'8"" 155lbs, and I'd like to get stronger"") they may include a snippet of important information which distinguishes them (""and I have no endocrine system"") and which needs an individualized response. 

* Most of the new users are going to come here, see the ""Read the FAQ"" note at the top of the page, or on the submission page, and then *actually go read it* (which takes about 45 minutes in total).  We may not notice such new users until they ask a good question (because they read the FAQ) and even then, they may not be noticeable. They are the great silent majority of our users.   

* Some of the new users will not read the FAQ, and then post a question which is in the FAQ already.  In those cases, I strongly recommend you use the copypasta in the FAQ to tell them to read it: 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi! Welcome to Fittit! You're going to love it here.

We saw you coming and have collected answers to your question **[right here](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness)**.


Welcome!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**EVEN BETTER** Last year, [CaptainSarcasmo made the single most important technological improvement to /r/fitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/nuzzk/how_to_welcome_the_thousands_of_new_people_who/c3c54jf) by making the above into a javascript bookmark: 

javascript:form=null;%20for%20(var%20ii%20=%200;%20ii%20&lt;%20document.forms.length;%20ii++)%20{%20f%20=%20document.forms[ii];%20if%20(f.classList.contains(""cloneable"")%20&amp;&amp;%20f.classList.contains(""usertext""))%20{form%20=%20f;%20break;}%20};textArea=form.getElementsByTagName(""textarea"")[0];textArea.value=""Hi!%20Welcome%20to%20Fittit!%20You're%20going%20to%20love%20it%20here.%20We%20saw%20you%20coming%20and%20have%20collected%20answers%20to%20your%20question%20in%20the%20[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness)%20([Backup](http://phraktured.net/fittit/FittitFAQ.html)).%20Welcome!"";submit=form.getElementsByTagName(""button"")[0];%20submit.click();

Make it into a bookmark, click it appropriately, and the copypasta *could not be easier* to submit. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's welcoming and friendly and lets new people know that [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) is a place where they can get information about improving their fitness.   I've counted: about 25% of the time, the above response gets a genuinely grateful response from the OP.  Also: you can get special bonus points if you change the link to  the actual section of the FAQ where the OPs question is directly answered.   Being welcoming and friendly lets new people know they are welcome here with their fitness questions, and it helps create new [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) members who then turn around and help more.  

Also, even -- **especially** -- if you don't know as much about fitness as others here, if you know the OP's question is answered in the FAQ, your answering this way above saves the time and effort someone more knowledgeable would have to spend answering the question, or referring to the FAQ themselves.  It's classic division of labor -- there are far more people who know less (or are less certain) about fitness than who know more, but they can be extremely useful giving the simple answer ""Here's how it's addressed in the FAQ!"".  Thus, **even if you don't feel knowledgeable about fitness, if you know the question is answered in the FAQ, you're doing everyone here a big favor if you post the above copypasta.**

More importantly: I recommend you use the copypasta because *we need you fresh for the actually hard questions.*   You see, if you type out responses to questions answered in the FAQ, it's time and effort spent which you *could* be using to type out a response which *isn't* answered in the FAQ.  

You only have so much time and energy.  And, if you're in the new stream, about the 400th time you type out an answer to ""I'm a 19 year old male of average health, how I can I get fit?""  you get antsy, and upset.  Don't these people learn? Don't they see the other posts and know they should read the FAQ?  It becomes easy to look past the point that all these new people are completely new, they've never seen [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) before, and they don't benefit from its past. So you might find yourself getting angry with them, and it's tempting to write something snippy or sarcastic.  **Don't**.  When you reach the point that you are feeling snippy and sarcastic to the new kids, it's time to step aside, stop reading the new queue, and let others pick up the slack.  

Finally, it's worth pointing out that there will be a small fraction of new users who will *not* be happy with the reference to the FAQ with their question. These are people who are less interested in the actual information, and mostly want human interaction -- someone to talk with them.  You are more than welcome to have a constructive conversation with them about how to improve their fitness, even though the same information you're providing is already in the FAQ.   But they're likely to start by snapping at you for telling them to read the FAQ ""when I've already read it and question's not in there"" (it is); or by saying ""I wanted to talk to someone, not read some wall of text.""  Such posters can be exhausting.  Don't feel like you have to answer all their questions -- in fact, you can ignore them and just move on if you like.  It's unreasonable for new people to believe they deserve individualized fitness and diet coaching, particularly when their fitness needs are identical to the vast majority of people who come here.  This is often referred to as the ""snowflake problem""; so many who come here think their problems are unique, like snowflakes, when in fact, they're identical to the vast majority of our users, and so the solution is identical.  

**TL; DR**

* Read each submission in the new queue carefully. 
* Refer new users who ask questions answered in the FAQ directly to the FAQ. Use the provided welcoming copypasta.   
* Don't answer questions if you feel frustrated by the repeated questions of new people.  Move away from the new queue, and let others get the slack. 
* Beware of the 'snowflakes': users who think they are unique -- and so deserve unique, individual service -- but are not.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Finally** here are the top five comments from last year's discussion: 

* **flynnzo (289 points)** Please remember, too, to remember who is writing these new year's posts. A lot of them ARE nineteen, or younger, or older with zero knowledge of what to do.  If you do write, be welcoming.  Don't ask girls for pics ""for science"" or tell them to go to gonewild, they're here for fitness.
Downvote people being dickish, if you feel they deserve it.

* **eric_twinge (70 points)** I'll make a plug for another route people can take.  If you *think* you know the answer to the question, but are unsure - answer it with the knowledge you have.  Don't be cocksure about it, but offer up what you have in a way that invites discussion. I've learned a fuckton more in this forum from being wrong than keeping quiet.  You may incur a few downvotes but that's a small price to pay for knowledge.  Most of the time someone will come in and point out why you are wrong and give you some informative sources you may not have been aware of. Plus, commenting makes you a part of the community and recognizable.  Cutting your chops on the beginner posts is a great way to get involved.  

* **therewontberiots (48 points)** Hey, I'm new here!  I'm reading the FAQ now and I have to say, it's excellent.  Anyway, mostly saying hi and look forward to taking better care of my body.

* **FastRedPonyCar (44 points)** I saw 3 people walk into the relatively small gym I workout at last night to speak with the head trainer on ""getting started"". Now I'm not a big guy at ALL but I'm in shape and I was working out right next to where one of the guys waiting to talk to the trainer while his buddy was talking with the trainer and he had this crazy scared/intimidated look on his face the whole time.   He wasn't in shape at all and it was pretty clear he was uncomfortable.    After that set, I felt bad for the guy, popped off my headphones and told him congrats for wanting to make a change in his life and taking that all important first step.  I showed him my before/after pics on my cell phone after losing 30 lbs and his demeanor did a total 180.  His face and body language became much more relaxed and we talked a bit with his friend and the trainer about some of the basic do's and don'ts and what will be expected of them in/out of the gym starting next week. I see so many hopeful people that first week every year at our gym and rarely do ANY of them make it more than 2 or 3 weeks.  I guess it's just too major of a lifestyle change to ask of them.  Hopefully those that I see at our gym can know that my ""I used to be just like you and I did it so can you"" story/pictures can help inspire.

* **austinb (24 points)** This can also be a great time to help **IMPROVE** the FAQ. There are still many questions that come up fairly often that are not directly addressed in the faq, so anyone that has a couple minutes could make a great contribution by editing in some new information.   Also, in addition to the copypasta, directing people to resources or other subreddits that directly address their goals, for example the program picker, [/r/loseit](/r/loseit) , [/r/gainit](/r/gainit) , [/r/BTFC](/r/BTFC) , [/r/GetMotivated](/r/GetMotivated) , [/r/90daysgoal](/r/90daysgoal) etc...

With that, let the New Year begin!

**TLDR:**  Fat guy lost 130lbs without gimmicky diets or food restrictions.

**Pictures**
I took photos every 10lbs from 330 to 200. BTW this helps A TON.  When you feel as if you haven’t made any progress you should just check your photos and instantly KNOW you are.

**ABOUT MY STORY:  (thanks for reading!)**
Last year (June 12th) I had this weird urge to step on a scale.  I had always known I was HUGE and getting bigger but I was always under the impression that I would always be 300lbs.  Maybe + or – 10lbs but generally I usually stayed within that boundary.  So I stepped on the scale and saw a horrid sight!  330 POUNDS!!  I was just in shock at that point and just felt it was time to make a change.  I knew nothing of weight loss or dieting.  Besides trying weight watchers a few times unsuccessfully.

So I went out and purchased an elliptical.  Found a really nice Sole elliptical for 300 bucks on Craigslist that retails for 1500.  You would be surprised how many people sell these things cheap with minimal use.  I also started weight watchers again and started counting points.  When I first started I could do about 10-15 min on the elliptical before I was running for the couch I had downstairs, sweat dripping from my whole body barley able to breathe.  I would not go outside because I really hate being “that fat guy people watch walking but never loses any weight”.  So instead I just started doing yard work.  I cut the grass every 2 weeks (usually I would do it once a month if that).  I discovered that I really enjoyed tasks that doubled as exercise and something else productive.  I never liked just exercising to exercise so mowing the law was a great bridge.

I was still on weight watchers counting points and just cutting out all the shitty fast food and soda(btw soda is my downfall love it soooo much).  Before I knew it I had lost 30lbs in the first month!  I was like No shit?  Got me really excited and motivated.  So with a growing confidence I added walking outside to my workout regiment.  I could really only walk for a good 20 min before I was tired but I was soon jogging intervals on hour long walks.  I continued to lose about 10lbs every 3-4 weeks (as you can see in my progress pics)  I could not believe how fast it was just rolling off.

I soon got off Weight watchers after about 2 months.  I just felt like the points thing was unnecessary and it was the same exact thing as counting calories.  It seemed like Weight watchers was just a way to train your mind how much you can eat.  Its not a lifetime solution, but it helps you get into the lifetime eating mindset.  Once I got the hang of what foods filled me up and how much calories were in those foods I just gave up on weight watchers and started counting calories in my head (and often times on myfitnesspal.com). 

I continued on counting calories and walking/elliptical for months.  When I started to get bored I got the P90 program (not p90x).  I started to do that around October.  It was fun for a while but it got boring FAST.  But I did do it for a good 60-70 days.  But to be honest I did not lose weight any faster on that than I did walking/elliptical.  But it was a nice distraction.  I was getting real bored around November and did have some slip ups throughout the holidays.  I made an agreement with myself that I would NOT join a gym until I lost 100lbs on my own.  I thought it was a nice round number and seemed like a good goal.  So in almost eerie type fashion I lost my 100th pound December 31st.   And joined the gym on new years day.  (yeah I am sure everyone labeled me a new years resolution guy but ohh well I got a good deal on my membership!)

So I have been spending the last 5 months going to the gym 3-5 times a week.  I quickly found out how boring my old routine was and preferred the gym’s equipment and atmosphere much more.  I lost another 30lbs in 5 months.  (I have had quite a few slip ups the last 2 months that had me yo-yoing back and forth between 195 and 210.  The problem is that when you start to like the way you look you get less concerned with eating right and maintaining a rigid workout schedule.  But I am persevering and continue to push myself until I am HAPPY with the way I look not just satisfied.

At the gym I generally do M-W-F lifting.  I will do upper body M-F and lower body on Wed.  Then on Tues and Thurs are cardio days and I will do an hour on various cardio machines.  I did the C25K thing for a few weeks but I quickly lost all motivation for cardio and focus mainly on lifting.  I finally hit 200lbs at the end of April and just have not got a chance to post until now.  Hopefully you will all approve.

**THE DIET:  (usually within 1200-1500 calories a day)**
I did weight watchers at first just eating whatever as long as I marked down the points.  I cut out fast food and soda completely.  After a while I just started counting calories.  I never paid any attention to carbs/protein/fats.  I started to for a few weeks but I did not see any amazing difference to my weight loss/muscle gain.  Plus I just don’t like to be restricted on what I want to eat.  Sure I know I have to restrict HOW MUCH I eat but I do not like food restrictions.  The way I was able to maintain for so long was discovering which foods made me full for the longest and strategizing what time of the day I should eat so I never am starving and feel the urge to cheat.

So generally this is how I ate for most of it

**Breakfast Items: (WATER WATER WATER)**
Egg white cheese omelets (those ones in the cartons are AWESOME)


Glass of skim milk or OJ.


Morning Glory Sausage patties (80 cal and soo good)


Fruit of your choice


Almond Milk (this is awful solo but add the light Hershey syrup and its awesome)


Yogurt


**Lunch/Dinner Items: (WATER WATER WATER)**
Oatmeal &lt;awesome way to keep full for long periods&gt;


Serving of Almonds


Full bag of Smart Pop popcorn (kettle corn is the best)


Turkey Sandwich on wheat bread (get deli cut turkey so much less sodium)


String Cheese


Chocolate Rice Cakes


Wheat Spaghetti


Tuna fish sandwich 


Wheat crust pizza (homemade)


Sugar free snack packs


Flavor Ice


Yogurt

6 months ago I was 132 lbs and a size medium.  I am now 133lbs and a size small. 


Lifts that I have recorded so far: **UPDATED AS OF 10/1.  This morning I did strength training and my 3RM backsquat ended up being 135#. http://imgur.com/MguIz  I originally had a weaker back squat # than my front squat, but that has changed since this morning! I can now back squat more than I weigh!**

* 1RM Dead Lift: 180#
* 2RM Front Squat: 125#
* *3RM Back Squat: 135#*
* 2RM Push Press: 80#
* 1RM Squat Snatch (most frustrating movement): 70#
* 3RM Bench Press: 95 lbs

To give an example of progression, in January 2012 my 1RM Front Squat was 105#.  105# is now my 5RM as of September 14, with my 2RM being 125#.  It should be noted that I do Crossfit and incorporate extra days of pure strength, so my progress may not be the most rapid, and I am okay with that.


Below are some more photos, all taken within the past month/2 months, my diet, workout regimen, and a little happy/sad story:

Obligatory gun show shot: http://imgur.com/LFI9F

And, my ass. http://imgur.com/rpELZ I don't even *care* if this appears to be vain, I wanted a nice ass.  **All** ladies want a nice ass.  Do you know how I got this ass?  I squatted heavy weights.  Back squats, front squats, squat cleans, squat snatches, and air squats. **Squats. Squats. Squats.**  It might not be the prime pick of the crop in terms of asses, because, well, I'm white...not Brazilian.  But it's a vast difference from where I was not even 6 months ago.  


So what did I do to get to where I am now? Well, I worked my fucking ass off, got into a healthy regimen and, most importantly, **kept my diet clean**.  I cannot stress the importance of nutrition enough.

My diet, save for this months challenge (doing a Whole30 Challenge which is basically strict Paleo), is very clean.  My kryptonites are craft beer, wings, and dark chocolate.  Personally, I am miserable with restriction.  I allow myself some treats here and there because it makes me happy.  I don't gorge on food - I savor it.  That understanding, that relationship with food, took a long time to construct.   If you're eating shit food and want to eat healthier, it's best to incorporate those changes slowly so that the replacement is long term rather than short term. **It isn't a diet - it's a lifestyle change.**  Take a few things out per week and allow your body to acclimate to the healthier changes.  When grocery shopping, stick to the perimeters of the store.  Buy whole, fresh food and cook it yourself with spices that don't contain chemicals or sugars.  I eat about 90% Paleo. 
 
From the point that I made that post 6 months ago I ended up getting my heart broken to pieces, moving, and taking a 2 month hiatus from Crossfit for financial reasons (due to moving).  From April to about August I was attending Crossfit about 3, maybe 4x a week.  I stepped it up a notch in August and have been going 3-5 days a week.  My box also offers pure strength training classes in the mornings which I have been attending as well.  Lifting weights is the best thing to happen to me in a long time, maybe even my entire life! 


And last, but not least, the ""little black dress"" pic.  http://imgur.com/CEgM0 There's a sad/happy story to this one.  I had a little black dress I had purchased in the summer of 2011 to wear for a birthday celebration.  I was excited to look cute for the guy I was dating.  Unfortunately, he was going away for a car show and I ended up not going out for my birthday, never wearing the dress.  To make a long story short, he was actually with another girl at that car show, a girl he was sleeping with for a large quantity of the time that I was with him, even sleeping with her the same day he spent time with me.   I found out, he confessed, and we were over.  I'd be lying if I said I wasn't heartbroken.  So, a month ago I decided I wanted to go out for my birthday and finally wear the dress.  The problem was, it didn't fit me anymore...it was too big!  So, I bought a smaller, little black dress :)  The end.

Okay, If you got this far then I am extremely appreciative.  It took me almost 2 hours to put together because I wanted to make sure I covered all of the bases.  If anyone has any constructive criticism or suggestions, please let me know!  The only issue I am having now is the stubborn layer of fat that just wants to hang around.  I seemed to have plateaued.  I am perfectly fine with the # on the scale, just would like that stubborn last bit of fat to go away because I have worked hard to build muscle and would like that to show.

I wanted to share some of the progress I’ve made over the last 13 months, as well as how I did it, in the hope that it inspires some of you to become fitter and healthier. I love browsing through photos of other people’s transformations for motivation here, so I thought I’d return the favor to those of you who have posted on this sub.

[**Before**](http://imgur.com/a/qFGVI)

Weight: 147 lbs
Height: 5’ 10.5”

I got in the gym fairly regularly my junior and senior years of high school (was a soccer player, so a lot of my efforts went into agility and endurance), but after my first year of college and not lifting or running much at all, I had lost a lot of ground. Here is what I looked like at the end of that time. I wasn’t too keen to have pictures of my physique at this time, so I don’t have any better-quality photos (what I’d give for one though—to those of you who are beginning to pursue fitness, take some good “before” photos so you can see just how far you’ve come! You’ll be happy you did later). I knew I had to change. So change I did.

[**1 Month**](http://imgur.com/a/hArcG)

Weight: 155 lbs

Higher caloric intake, lower stress, and weight lifting helped me regain some of the size and strength I had before. Rapid “newbie” gains at this point. A lot of the mass is from body fat.
 
[**7 Months**](http://imgur.com/a/lkWnR)

Weight: 163 lbs

Seeing consistency and dedication paying off. Gains slow down a little as expected. Working to get my squat form down-pat at this point, so used lighter weight on that movement to make sure I was going to parallel without knees going past my toes. Great decision! Lost a little bit of fat and leaned out a little more as I continued to gain muscle. 

[**13 Months (Current)**](http://imgur.com/a/v90ZB)

Weight: 170 lbs
Height: 5’ 10.5”

Feeling very encouraged with my progress. Not nearly “there” yet, but much more pleased with myself and how I feel. I still have a bunch of weak points I need to sort out, so I haven’t relented at all.



**Workout Schedule**


I opt of for a 4-5 day split per week. The major lifts like bench press, overhead press, pullups, rows, etc. form the backbone of my training. Then, I'll add other more peripheral movements around these that usually vary by week. I can’t give you an exact workout plan I followed the entire time because it changes constantly! The split usually looks something like:


Day 1: Chest, triceps, and calves

Day 2: Back, biceps, and abs

Day 3: Hamstrings, quads, and calves

Day 4: Shoulders and any lagging muscle group

Optional day 5: abs or any lagging muscle group.



When I’m working out, I usually do 3-6 sets with rep ranges from 5-12. I think there’s benefit to doing all rep ranges and no magic number that induces muscles to grow. I typically take 1-2 minute rests in between sets.

Intensity is key to your workout. It’s a mental game, but if you want to get atypical results, you’re going to have to go above and beyond what other people are willing to do. Your body doesn’t want to adapt and grow unless you force it.

As you’ve probably noticed, I don’t schedule cardio in these sessions apart from a warm up. This is because I’m content with my BF% and I’m focused on gaining mass. If you’re trying to reduce your body fat, I recommend doing some HIIT too. Recently, I’ve tried to do my legs twice a week. Again, it changes a lot because I usually conform my workout schedule around my academic schedule. A decent rule of thumb: if it’s not sore, you should probably be working it.


**Diet**


Generally, I shoot for around 3000-3100 per day. To be honest, I’m not super strict or meticulous about my diet. I don’t keep track of my macros very thoroughly or my calories, although I have in the past. I simply try to avoid high calorie and processed foods, get 150 grams of protein a day or more, and get a lot of variety in fruits and vegetables. I think I have a reasonably fast metabolism, but more importantly, I’ve developed good, clean eating habits so I don’t really struggle too much with gaining excess fat. Instead, I find it harder to eat enough! I’m sure if I ever decide to get more serious and compete or something a few years down the road, I’ll have a more stringent diet plan. 

My supplements include creatine and whey. I’m not really a supplement guy right now.

Don’t forget about rest! I get between 7.5 and 9 hours per night. You grow during your rest and sleep, so it’s essential.


**Philosophy**


You can never stop striving for your goal, trying to get better. This applies to all areas of life, really. Lack of forward progress is probably a sign of regression. 

When it comes to lifting, I’ve found that focusing on the muscle contraction is more important than the amount of weight lifted. Sometimes, this requires you to disregard your ego in the gym (not that anyone in there does or should care what you do). For example, I recently changed the way I do pullups so that I target my latissmus dorsi more effectively by pulling my elbows wider and pausing at the top of the lift while mentally forcing the lats to contract. This severely reduces the number I can do, but is much more effective. For more information on this, watch some of Kai Greene’s “train with Kai” videos.

I’ve found that consistency and intensity are essential and the primary reason for my results. I truly believe anyone with the dedication and know-how can do what I’ve done. The question is, will you?

Pain is a good sign you're pushing too hard and need to do easier planks instead of thinking you're ready for full wall handstands.  Use your head and train safely.

I think it's time for another [28-Day Handstand Challenge](http://www.eatmoveimprove.com/2013/05/28-day-handstand-challenge/?utm_source=challenge-post&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=28-Day+Challenge+-+Fitness)

We did the [28-Day Handstand Challenge](http://www.eatmoveimprove.com/2013/05/28-day-handstand-challenge/?utm_source=challenge-post&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=28-Day+Challenge+-+Fitness) few months ago and had great success.  When I first did this in December, I worked with 300 people and they all made significant progress on their handstand.  

When I did it again in January, we had **1600** people who subscribed and I got hoardes of emails - all really excited about making progress towards their first handstand.

Thus, I think its time to do this again.  Hopefully we can get even more people to start working on their first handstand hold.

Here's how it works:

* Read [this article](http://www.eatmoveimprove.com/2013/05/28-day-handstand-challenge/?utm_source=challenge-post&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=28-Day+Challenge+-+Fitness) that explains the basics of the challenge.
* If you want more guided direction, you can sign up for the free eBook that explains the against-the-wall progression. ([Sign up form can be found here](http://28dayhandstandchallenge.com?utm_source=challenge-post&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=28-Day+Challenge+-+Fitness), too).
* Keep a simple check-box-training-log to keep up with your commitment.

That's it.  The program is designed for **adults to quickly learn the handstand.** By following this very basic program, here are some of the results we have seen:

&gt;""I just started the program - on Day 3 - and I'm surprised by the fact that I can already hold myself up there for almost the full minute without a break! I never thought to walk up the wall backwards so thanks for posting that tip with your original 28-day program."" -[porkburp](/u/porkburp)

.
&gt;"" I can clearly state, that you got me upside down, for the first time in many many years :)"" -[hexlibris](/u/hexlibris)

.
&gt;""Been doing the program and can hold for 2.5 mins against the wall, and did count of 10 (not seconds) free standing (not against the wall in any way) today.."" -[hefoxed](/u/hefoxed)

.
&gt;""An awesome program to follow and go along SL5x5."" -[olbapazem](/u/olbapazem)

.
&gt;""It's like you read my mind, ignored all the horrible things and then brought me exactly what I need.""-[peabish](/u/peabish)

People of all ages from 18 to 65 have taken the challenge with good results.

If the handstand is one of your goals, now is the time to tackle it.  Don't let anything hold you back now!

1366895913.0,1355,self.Fitness,1d2wrh,Starting Poop - A beginner's guide to healthy and enjoyable pooping,2263,908,483,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1d2wrh/starting_poop_a_beginners_guide_to_healthy_and/,"Ok so I have wanted to write this post for a while now. This is a topic that most people face everyday, so it's worth it to master this subject. Below are just a few quick tips to make life easier and more enjoyable and to experience the best poops you will ever have in your life.
Especially all people who are eating a lot in general to pursue fitness goals and all people in general who consume a lot of protein may find it hard sometimes to excrete all the bodie's waste in a healthy and pleasant fashion. I don't want to go into too much detail here but basically if it hurts, burns, bleeds or is fragmented and everything but the consistency similar to a homemade protein bar, then you are doing something wrong. So here follows some quick tips:

**Fiber/Fibre**
Yes this is the golden building block that you will need in order to achieve a clean colon and perfect consistency of the matter. The majority of fibre should come from vegetables, legumes, bran, nuts, and grains but just google lists of fibre rich foods.

If you struggle with getting the amount of fibre needed into your system or you just want to hardcore fibre cleanse your body then you should invest in some psyllium husk. This is a natural seed that you can get as the seed itself, powder or pills and can really give you that fibre boost at the end of the day. 
This is like fairy powder, it's not gourmet food but it makes life easier and you will love the effects it has. I usually take a teaspoon of husk in the morning or evening or both if I feel that I need it and I am always overwhelmed the next day by how great it works.

So without fibre, life is bad and pointless.

**Squatted Pooping**
Ok so now that we have perfect poop we will want to optimise the pooping process itself. I always find it is utmost satisfying if I have the feeling that the process is smooth and cleansing and that it leaves you 10 pounds lighter. 
Fun fact: Sitting isn't the optimal pooping position, squatting is. This is why the squat is such a dangerous exercise if you need to poop. I could now give you some evolution background and how seated pooping is bad, but I'm not a scientist and I can't be bothered. Take my word for it and or google it yourself. Basically your intestine has a bend in it if you are sitting and we don't want no bend.

So how can I incorporate the squat into my bathroom session? Well there are superfluous gadgets you can buy to get you into the squatting position above your toilet but the easiest way is to take of all your clothes beneath your waistline and just squat on the toilet seat. This takes time to master but it seriously makes everything better. Just make sure that your toilet supports your full weight and that you can support yourself on a wall or similar object so you don't fall. That would be really embarrassing. Also I am not accountable for anything bad that happens to you if you try this. I will however laugh if you tell me about it.
And one last thing that guys have to remember is to point your schlong downwards into the bowl otherwise you'll have a bad time.

So that's it, I hope I could help.

**Edit:** Ok Ok, so for everyone concerned about the toilet breaking: My guess is that it doesn't make that much of a difference if you sit on the toilet or you squat on it as the manufacturers have to take into account people raising their legs while sitting and thereby putting all their bodyweight on the toilet. Also toilets should be stable enough to take overweight people into account, so for the average or ripped guy I think there shouldn't be a problem. That being said one has to be careful, as you wouldn't want to fall and knock yourself out on the floor with your pants down. A shard in the ass probably also isn't very fun. So maybe this could help if you don't want to squat on the toilet as suggested by DirtyHotDog: http://www.squattypotty.com/

**Edit 2** Well, this has been quite a ride. Just wanted to thank everyone for their feedback and comments, I've read all of them. Fun topics like these are actually not as superficial as one would think. If you have to deal with a certain topic everyday then trying to master it will make your life so much easier. You should really try that approach with everything you encounter daily.

Ok so to elaborate on all the comments:

Yes, you should drink more water when consuming more fibre but as a healthy, shredded and overall suave guy you should be drinking a lot of water anyway. Just make sure you drink an extra glass of water with a fibre rich meal and you'll be good.
Squatting on the toilet should be practiced with care, but it's hard to argue with the squatting position itself. If you think it's utter BS then how 'bout you just try it? And then be amazed of how this revolutionary technique developed by a household mom in china can enlighten your day. How you decide to achieve the squat is up to you and up to the stability of your toilet.

For pooping on the go, squatting can get a little harder. I'm not saying it isn't possible if you are dedicated, but sometimes you just can't get into that position safely. I then lean forward as much as possible to emulate the squatting position as has been suggested in the comments as well. The goal really is to get rid of that bend. Yes your intestines are bent anyway but it's about the end that counts. 

Also you can experiment with raising your feet on a stool or something like that to get into the squatting position but I personally don't think its that comfortable half sitting in the bowl with my pillermann squeezed between my legs.

So, the ultimate pooping tip for the end: Just lay some toilet paper in the water to create a splash stopper. Especially if you are in a heightened position this will reduce noise and nasty backsplash. Nobody likes a poo water bidet.",,False,,t5_2qhx4,1366959123.0,,,True,t3_1d2wrh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1d2wrh/starting_poop_a_beginners_guide_to_healthy_and/,
1376397478.0,1346,self.Fitness,1k9vpe,Something rarely discussed here or in articles: Ridicule and discouragement from loved ones when seeing results,1897,551,687,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1k9vpe/something_rarely_discussed_here_or_in_articles/,"I'm writing this after recent events involving my girlfriend, mostly fueled by anger and revenge, so excuse any harsh wording (I'll do my best).

I have rarely read any articles in here about negative views towards fitness. I have seen lots of talk about overweight people trying to make a positive change and getting made fun of at the gym (name calling from douchy gym rats, people making fun of them while jogging), but this is a little different. See I experienced this after my transformation. I was 6'1 225, and (very) long story short, cut down to 175 and began years of weight training and nutrition ([album after cutting down](http://imgur.com/a/vxUW7)).

Anyways, instead of being congratulated on my successful transformation, I received a *ton* of flak about it. 

""Maybe you should take one day off *a year* man""

""So is body image the most important thing to you now?""

""Wow this shit has really gotten to your head, hasn't it?""

Endless comments not congratulating me on my success, but instead, and completely fucking mind-boggling, people tried to find negative reasons for why I counted my calories, undertook grueling fitness regimens and stopped treating my body like a garbage can. After I used to eat like a pig, they decided I must have some psychological problems, self esteem issues, and even an addiction problem.

This eventually gave way, and besides the odd joke here and there people have accepted it (but still rarely congratulate me. And by people, I mean best friends, close friends, and family).

ANYWAYS

My current girlfriend of about 9 months began her transformation about a year ago. I'd known her for a couple years before we started dating, and she decided on her own to make a change. Another (very) long story short, she's been hugely successful, lost 30 lbs, is now in the middle of her healthy weight range, goes to the gym 2 hours a day, 5-6 days a week, and watches everything that she eats.

Guess what?

However bad my discouragement and ridicule from loved ones was, she is getting it 10x as bad.

""You look sick and disgusting now"" - (overweight) best friend of years

""We are worried about you"" - other friends

""This isn't like you"" - some family

""She just doesn't eat, she's addicted to losing weight"" - Brother

The list goes on.

She gets this shit maybe two - three times a week. What's worse, they not only say things like this, but almost beg her to stop, tell her they think she's doing this to impress me (she started before we dated), and that they have never seen her like this.

I know that she is the happiest she's ever been (and /r/fitness you know what it's like to feel so much better about yourself after making large healthy changes). But these comments are so discouraging she hides going to the gym, lies about it to friends, and will force herself to eat fatty, unnatural foods when with them to try and ward off some of the negativity. She cries to me at night, tells me she doesn't want to keep on in this healthy manner if this is how people will treat her.

So, I'm glad to be able to vent about this, and I guess in closing I ask what to do. I'll be honest, I have some pre-typed out emails ready to send to everyone individually, void of any cursing or threats, just letting them know what they are doing to her. She has told me not to say anything, begged me to leave it alone and let her deal with. 

What do I do?

**TL;DR Girlfriend is getting told from best friends and family she has self esteem and addiction problems for going to the gym so much, counting calories, and watching everything she eats. Discourages her to the point of tears and wanting to give up, enrages me. Asks me not to say anything to her friends, but I am thinking I should just unleash a shit storm on them. What do?**

Edit: I apologize for the misleading title, turns out this is talked about all the time.  Anyways the advice and encouragement is appreciated, reading these responses is definitely giving me ideas and phrases to make her feel better and avoid causing conflict in her life.  I'll continue reading after work.

**CONCLUSION: So the responses here are so incredibly in depth and helpful, everything from ways to educate her loved ones, to just being ourselves and letting the noise filter through, and even people telling me that we are being big babies.  All of it was helpful, and I even stole some of your quotes to make her feel better, [which seemed to have helped](http://i.imgur.com/ZRZnBcp.jpg?1).  People, turns out that success makes others bitter, and whether it's jealousy, ignorance of a subject, or general concern, you know what's best for you.  Your whole life you will be told which job is best for you, which lifestyle you should subscribe to, and little tips that people preach.  It really isn't anything to take to heart, just smile and say your fine.

Year one was low calorie and walking--&gt;running. Started out with severe cramping in lower legs (possibly compact compartment disorder). Stuck with it and it went away. 1400-2500 calories a day depending on alcohol intake. Monitored with FatSecret.com on my Android. I was motivated by 5k, then 10k's then a Sprint Duathalon. That is really how I did it initially, concentrating on my running performance; trying to beat my last 5K time. I went from a 42 min 5K to a 28:30 5K. Started at 310 lbs and went down to a low of 215 lbs and 18%BF.

Second year was mostly lifting; kind of a bastardized Starting Strength. I'm at 240 now with 14% or so BF. Pretty much all the fat is stuck in my gut. I bench 1RM @ 240, Squat 3 x 5RM @ 315 and Deadlift 1RM @ 400.

Looking forward to the future. My goal is &lt;250lb @ &lt;10% BF, with some serious weightlifting numbers.

You can do it Reddit. Stop fucking around.

EDIT: As a few people pointed out, my BF measurements are suspect. Either user error on the calipers or the fact that my skin isn't normal after being obese. For reference, here are my [measurements](http://imgur.com/OKX3r,wc4go,h6Xul#1).

Also, maybe a little too hurried when I wrote the post. More data:

Here is [data](http://imgur.com/OKX3r,wc4go,h6Xul#0) on my diet and exercise, tracked with FatSecret and Endomondo for a year. I got out of the habit of meticulously logging each calorie, which is why it ends in July. I highly recommend doing it for at least a little while to learn healthy habits, what is good to eat, bad, etc. I switched to a higher calorie, high protein, low carb diet in May and June. 

[Here](http://imgur.com/oAZAr) is how many hours of exercise it took me.

1351016515.0,1340,self.Fitness,11yihw,An open letter from Muscle &amp; Fitness' Editor-in-chief calling out Guinness and challenging them to test the man with the world's largest biceps. This could get interesting...,1737,397,492,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/11yihw/an_open_letter_from_muscle_fitness_editorinchief/,"Muscle &amp; Fitness' Editor-in-Chief Shawn Perine isn't buying it. He's got a challenge for Guinness and he's willing to put his money where his mouth is. 

Dear Guinness Record Keepers,
You've been duped. Or maybe you just made a bad judgment call. Either way, the mistake is yours, and you're going to have to live with it for all of 2013, at least. By anointing Moustafa Ismail the possessor of the world's largest biceps you've discredited your Book of World Records and cast doubt on the veracity of everything inside of it.

When I was a kid, the Guinness Book was my bible. I was always fascinated by Extremes—the biggest and tallest, fastest and heaviest, richest and oldest—and your annual tome fed my hunger for such knowledge. I would read it cover to cover many times over throughout the 70's and 80's. I'd toss around names like Robert Earl Hughes, Robert Pershing Wadlow and Lucia Zarate with such regularity an outsider might have thought I was referring to beloved family members. As the world's heaviest, tallest and shortest persons, they were held in nearly such estimation by my younger self.

Based on the sober explanation of the Guinness standards in the front of your book, I knew with absolute certainty that every single record within its pages was unimpeachable. Anyway, what would be the point of having a book of world records if the criteria wasn't drum-tight? I mean, if that were the case, the man you list as having the world's largest biceps could actually have arms full of a synthetic compound encasing rather modest biceps. Oh, wait…

I won't get into the technical details of what's going on with Mr. Ismail's arms, and I'm not about to malign him for a personal decision that affects only him. This was your doing. You're the ones I'm calling out for a poor decision. I will direct you, however, to search any of a number of bodybuilding forums for the word ""synthol"" for examples of dozens of men with arms that look identical to Mr. Ismail's. There's a telltale look to injected arms: a smooth, bloated appearance with zero separation between biceps and triceps, upper arms disproportionately larger than forearms, and no difference in shape between a relaxed and flexed arm. That's because you can't flex oil.

Now, if you put a caveat in your book explaining that your criteria is merely the largest arm (not biceps), artificially inflated or not, then you may have a contender in Mr. Ismail. However, I would guess that the pendulous arms of the world's heaviest living human being, 1400-pound Manuel Uribe's, might stretch the tape further than Moustafa Ismail's. You might want to check on that.

If you're interested in verifying that the man you named as having the biggest biceps in the world (as you once, correctly, listed Arnold Schwarzenegger as having) actually has the world's largest muscular arms, I will personally foot the bill to have a medical evaluation performed that would determine their composition. If I'm wrong in my belief, and they are entirely muscle—all 31"" of them—I will give Mr. Ismail $1000 for his troubles and donate $1000 to the charity of your choice. If I'm right though, and Mr. Ismail's arms are a combination of muscle and additives designed to increase their volume (force-fed flesh, if you will), I ask that you donate $1000 to my favorite charity and award the title to any one of a number of professional bodybuilders in contention for having the largest muscular arms in the world. I can help direct you to my top candidates.

By the way, years ago I remember seeing a man dressed as Uncle Sam walking stiff-legged in a 4th of July parade who had to be 10' tall, at least. You guys need to track him down. He HAS to be the world's tallest man!

I've been in and out of shape for about 2 years and a huge mountain biker so I wasnt completely out of shape...just shapes :)

I was sitting on the couch one Friday night around 2am completely wasted with my girlfriend and the infomercial for the Insanity program came on; I remember very vividly turning to her and saying ""I just want the damn t-shirt...""  I didn't know that by making that decision I was going to become borderline obsessed with fitness.

I kept it simple at first.  I did 2 rounds of Insanity and saw awesome results by just simply losing the fat and eating healthy.  I then did the Insanity Asylum series to start building up some of the muscle I lost or never had and then when I decided to bulk up I did Beachbody's Body Beast program - some might laugh, but I think it was a good intro into weight lifting and it allowed me to be more confident when I went to the gym.
As of recently I've started the MFT28 schedule from bodybuilding.com - it's really high in volume, but if you have the time and motivation its not impossible to keep up with and I used this program as a cutting schedule to tone back up.

I was at 192lbs when I decided I needed to make a change and got down to 158.  My current weight today is 173 and I feel fantastic!
I can post before and afters for each program I completed when I get home.

In the fast paced world we live in today, sometimes a quick picture or infographic, will really get a lot of points across. The more I read the new post on here, I have realized two things: one, not enough people are reading the FAQs, and two, the same questions are getting asked over and over.

Being new to the idea of fitness and weightloss can be overwhelming. Especially in a get it now and get it fast article-driven world. Have you ever tried finding weight loss tips online? It's ridiculous. They'll try to convince you that honey... or peppers... or grapefruits are magical, or that carbs are bad... or that fats are bad... or that counting calories doesn't work. 

---

This is not a alternative, or replacement, to the FAQ. This is merely a supplement of sorts. A quick over-view of some of the major points answering some of the more frequent questions that come up. A FAFAQ? For the already over-whelmed, the simplistic and easy to understand graphic will help get people's foot in the door.

But seriously guys... if you haven't, read the [**FAQS--&gt;**](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness)

**EDIT 1**: Added a couple of sections to full version including bulk/cut and cardio, also modified some existing segments.

**EDIT 2**: I forgot about women. The information still applies, but women have naturally more bodyfat. Thus to achieve abs as a women, you'd needs to reach or approach approx 16-18% bodyfat.  Future edits to the graphic will reflect this info. 

**EDIT 3**: Added a bodyweight section to the full version. Also, edited some existing info and grammar.

I get plenty of sleep and stick to a regular schedule. 

Can anyone else relate to this? Why would not working out cause me to lose energy/be stressed? 

Regardless, this is great incentive to get back to the gym lol.

Warning - I may ramble.

Last time you saw me was [half a year ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/oaz6s/as_promised_my_1_year_of_blood_sweat_and_tears/), and your support and response was overwhelming! As mentioned, I return one last time with [my one point five year progress in photos](http://i.imgur.com/wkWP4.jpg). 

Firstly, I'd like to say that the Reddit community has not only been supportive and encouraging, but humbling as well. I've recieved a ton of private messages about how I have helped others, or was able to motivate them to start making a change in their life. I've been choked up on more then a few occasions reading these, and it blows my mind that what originally started as a way to keep me from failing has inspired others to succeed in their goals too. Everyone who has shared a comment, story, or laugh...thank you! Y'all continue to push me and motivate me in ways I doubt I'll ever be able to fully or even properly explain...it's one of the most fucked up things is finding a friend on Facebook linking you to your own photos being used for an inspirational meme, or ripping you off to sell fat burning pills haha

My diet hasn't changed too much - I am currently eating LeanGains style, a few hundred cals over maintinence on lift days, maintinence on non-lift days, and doing so within an 8 hour time period every day. I'm hoping to add a bit more to my frame while keeping relatively lean. 

Additionally, due to overwhelming feedback, it's inspired me to launch a [YouTube page](http://www.youtube.com/user/jclayfitness?feature=watch) where I hope to feature different helpful videos on diet/nutrition; [a Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/JeremyClayFitness) to post up random links/inspirations/meals and [a boring ol website/blog](www.jclayfitness.com) . People of the internet have been my source of information and inspiration ever since I started this, and I'm hoping to help those that who are looking for it in return. These pages are all brand new as of today, so if you join them, I'll get content on the move soon enough!

As for me, I'm currently sitting around 195lbs as you see in the last progress photo, maybe 10-11.5% bodyfat, but I really am not sure. I am currently training 2 friends - 1 for 2 months now, and another friend who has gone from 315lbs Sept. 1 and was sitting 201.5 as of today! I keep telling him to post to Reddit and he promises to once he's under 200...

Lifts since last time in pounds: 

Bench: 240 - 255 1RM
Squat: 240 - 265 1RM
Deadlift: 355 to 415 1RM (set yesterday! Form was piss, but the lift happened).

So I guess that's all! Just wanted to share, and maybe field any other questions if people have them again. I will respond to as much as I can as soon as I can! My thanks to you all for your help, posts, and support, I can't say I'd of made it without the Interwebz.

I ran my first 5K in Sept 2012 in just under 30 minutes and will be running my second 5K in a few weeks. I plan to run a 10K this fall.

I thought the weight loss was the hardest part, but it turns out that the  difficulties have only begun, as I am relearning how to eat and treat my body.

To lose the weight I participated in a medically supervised program, HMR diet. My food intake was highly controlled for the majority of those 9 months, but now it's more ""normal."" I eat 5-10 servings of fruits and vegetables daily as well as drinking a minimum of 64 oz of water.

As far as my exercise routine, I do lots of cardio- walking, running, elliptical, bike, etc. I also do a bit of strength training. On average, I spent 60-70 minutes per day working out. I don't usually take a day off but rather I have a day or two each week where I might spend a little bit less time working out and being easier on my body.

Motivation? I was on the road to being one of those very young people with diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol issues. I wanna live a long time. I was simply sick of being fat. I know I'm not quite at my ideal weight yet, but I'm still working on it. I am surrounded by a tremendous amount of people who offer amazing support no matter water. Also, they provide accountability, which is so important.

My long time lifting partner, former HS teammate, and close friend died last week. The news hit me like a ton of bricks. Here was a man, 22, engaged to be married, father to an infant, new job, fresh off of probation, finally clean and sober and ready to tackle life.

Cut short.

He overdosed on heroin Thursday night. Clean and sober for months, relapsed and died.

He leaves behind a son and a wife-to-be, a father and mother, two brothers, and countless friends. I'm haunted at night to think, I pushed him, hard. I pushed him so hard in the gym. He trained with me all through prep for my first show.

He had endless potential... He had a checkered past, yes, but he was finally on the right track. I thought I could be one of the good influences in his life. 

And one day he just stopped coming. A few weeks went by and I couldn't contact him. And then one day he called me and told me he was coming home, that he was clean and had a new job, on the right track, got a new place to stay with his fiancee and son, he was coming back to the gym, ready to do the natural bodybuilder thing, ready to make it right.

I tried to get in touch with him week after week- late hours, baby needs this, no time to lift, he seemed so bummed. He was so amped up to come back, but the timing was all off. I brushed it off, I understood. Life happens.

I wish I had tried harder. I wish I had rode his ass and dragged him into the weight room every night. Kicking and screaming if I had to because I know he wouldn't get into trouble if he was there with me. I know he wouldn't be out getting fucked up.

Addiction is a serious disease. There are those of us who haven't been personally affected, maybe we're the lucky ones. I smoked cigarettes for years and quit cold turkey. Lucky me. I can't understand what it's like because I've never experienced it.

I couldn't relate. I just wish I had one more day with that fucker... One more hour of raw pulls, chalk and blood, screaming and laughing, sweat and tears and memories. I wish I could have been the hard-ass good influence when he needed it the most. He fucking looked up to me and I wasn't there.

Now all I have is questions. What ifs...

http://en.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1bly8t/strength_size_and_the_truth_about_rep_ranges/

I’ve been planning this post for a while. I think the users of /r/gainit will benefit greatly from learning the difference between lifting for strength and lifting for size. I’ve made brief comments in the past about it, and it’s been met with a lukewarm reception. That may be due to the popularity of  the beginner strength programs on reddit, and the revelation that size isn’t necessarily the aim of those program (even though that’s what us “gainers” want, right?). We’ll get to that. First, I’d like to give you a brief introduction into the two main types of hypertrophy. 

*****

### Myofibrillar hypertrophy

*****

Myofibrillar hypertrophy, or “strength” hypertrophy, leads to an increase in the myosin and actin proteins, which are the contractile proteins in the myofibrils (the type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers, or the “fast-twitch” fibers). In simpler terms, when lifting heavy weights and putting your muscles under new stress (**progressive overload** -- increasing either the volume or weight of a lift every workout to ensure increased myofibrillar hypertrophy), your body will respond by strengthening it’s ability to contract its muscles. 

The recruited motor units in the movements also increase with myofibrillar hypertrophy, as does their efficiency, effectively allowing the body to perform movements “easier” over time, hence the need to progressively increase weight.  Ultimately, the effect is an increase in the strength and response of your fast-twitch muscle fibers. The “stronger” your fast-twitch fibers, the “stronger” the neuromuscular response, and the heavier the weight you are able to lift.

*****

### Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy

*****

Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, or “size” hypertrophy, leads to an increase in the amount of sarcoplasm in your muscle tissue. Sacroplasm is the fluid (cytoplasm) that surround the myofibrils in a muscle. The sarcoplasm contains things such as ATP, glycogen, creatine phosphate, and water. In simpler terms, when sarcoplasmic hypertrophy occurs, the amount of fluid (or cytoplasm) in the muscle increases (expands), creating a larger muscle. This type of hypertrophy is achieved by using slower, controlled movements to put the muscles under stress for longer and activate the slow and fast twitch muscle fibers and deplete the muscles of energy. 

Note that increasing the size of a muscle **does not** require an increase in the amount of contractile protein in the myofibrils, meaning increasing size does not mean increasing your strength. In the same vein, strength can be increased without causing an increase in the size of the muscle. 

*****

### How do I train for the different types of hypertrophy? 

*****

The primary way to train for size or strength is to measure the time under tension, and how heavy the weight causing the tension is (relative to your own level of strength – i.e. your 1 rep maximum). This involves either a focus on neuromuscular training (strength) or metabolic training (size)

Neuromuscular training focuses on the nerves and increasing the contractile proteins in the myofibrils. This is specialized by keeping your muscles under very heavy stress (within 85-100% of your 1RM), using fast, explosive movements for 1-40 seconds per set. Rest periods should be anywhere from 90 seconds to 5+ minutes.

Metabolic training focuses on the supply of energy of muscles, and depleting said energy. This is specialized by keeping your muscles under moderately heavy stress (within 60-75% of your 1RM) using slow, controlled movements for 40-70 seconds per set.  Rest periods should be between 30-60 seconds. 

You may have noticed that there is a gap between 75-85% of your 1RM between these levels of training. That is because that is the spot where these two forms of training are generally on an even level (i.e. you will increase strength and size in a somewhat equal manner).

*****

### How should I measure my 1 rep maximum and the related percentages?

*****

Fortunately, we have a lot of great resources available to us to calculate this easily. [This](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/other7.htm) calculator will assist you in finding your different weight lifting maximums at different percentages. I find the easiest way to use this tool is to get in the gym for a day and do 1x5 for every single exercise in your routine. Make sure you are using a weight where you are maxing out on the fifth rep and could not manage another. You can then input each number for each lift at the number of 5 reps and you will get all your weight numbers for the different percentages. You will see how to use these different percentages to help you reach your goals below.

*****

### How should I measure the time my muscles are under tension in accordance with my goals?

*****

The easiest way to do this is to adhere to a specific rep scheme. Naturally, when performing fewer reps, your muscle will be under tension for a shorter period of time and the weight will be closer to your maximum (and therefore building strength through neuromuscular training). On the other side, when completing a higher amount of reps your muscles will be under tension for longer, and the weight will need to a be a little further from your maximum to allow for the higher volume (and therefore building size through metabolic training). Here are the rep guidelines to follow for your specific training goals:

Rep Range|Percent of 1 Rep Max|Achieved Amounts of Hypertrophy|
:---|:---:|---:|
1-5 Reps|85-100%|Mostly myofibrillar, a little sarcoplasmic|
6-8 Reps|75-85%|A near equal moderate amount of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic|
9-12 Reps|70-75%|Largely sarcoplasmic, some myofibrillar, a little endurance|
13-15 Reps|65-70%|Mostly sarcoplasmic, some endurance, and a little myofibrillar|
15+ Reps |65% and below|Largely endurance, some sarcoplasmic, a little myofibrillar*|

*Note that as you more you increase the reps beyond 15, the more endurance takes over and the benefits of either hypertrophy become negligible.

*****

### How do I use this information to create a workout routine to meet my goals?

*****

First, identify what your goal is. Are you looking to put on some size, do you want to see increases in strength, or do you want to work on both at the same time? There is nothing wrong with any of these goals, and each has their own pros/cons:

* Primarily training for strength is a goal that has few cons, especially if you are mostly satisfied with your current size. You can still gain small amounts of size, and you can vastly increase your strength in a short period of time if you train and recover properly. Be wary though. High intensity strength training is *very* taxing on the central nervous system, and overtraining can occur easily. If you want to train for strength, employ set/rep schemes such as 5x5, 6x4, 8x3 with high rest periods in between sets. Lift within 85% of your 1RM at 5 reps, and increase the percentage as you decrease reps.
* Primarily training for size is a goal that has benefits, but does have drawbacks. If you train for size, especially as a beginner, you will eventually hit a wall in the gains you are able to make due to a lack of increased strength, and you will have to focus some on strength training at some point (this is the reason strength programs are recommended for beginners). The lower your level of strength, the sooner you are going to hit a plateau.  If you want to train primarily for size, employ set/rep schemes such as 3x15, 4x12, and 5x9 with a lower rest period in between sets. Supersets (performing two exercises back-to-back with no rest in between) also becomes a strong option to deplete even more energy. Lift at least 65% of your 1RM, increasing the percentage as you decrease reps.
* Training for both strength and size is in my opinion the best way to go. You get the benefits of both forms of training at the same time.  There are two methods that I recommend to achieve this:

## Method #1: Traditional Strength/Size Optimization Training

Employ set rep schemes such as 4x8, 5x7, or 6x6 with a moderate rest period of around 60-120 seconds. Lift 75% of your 1 RM for 8 reps, 80% for 7 reps, and ~85% for 6 reps. 

## Method #2: Linear Periodization

Linear periodization allows you to focus your goals on different ranges on the hypertrophy spectrum during different “periods.” Here are two examples of a linear periodization schedule:

Weeks 1-4: 3x15 reps at 65% of your max  
Weeks 5-8: 4x10 reps at 72% of your max  
Weeks 9-12: 5x5 reps at 85% of your max  

Weeks 1-4: 4x12 reps at 70% of your max  
Weeks 5-8: 5x7 reps at 80% of your max  
Weeks 9-12 6x3 reps at 90% of your max  

In the end, I think whether you use linear periodization, a different form of periodization, a pyramid rep scheme, etc. that you should eventually utilize all the different rep ranges if you want to your training to be as optimal and effective as possible.

*****

### In conclusion 


*****

I really hope this information has been helpful to you, and gives you perspective on exactly what direction you need to be headed in to achieve your goals. Remember that the workout is only a small part of the equation and that nutrition and recovery are a big part of what will maximize the effectiveness of this information, and I wish the biggest and strongest of gains on every one of you!

TL;DR - you may have to read it a couple times over, do extra research, before you can understand it fully. All of this is not 100% one way or the other, 3 reps is still going to cause some sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. for an relatively untrained individual all of the rep ranges are going to see a noticeable increase in size and strength.

Now, I can't do either for an entire year. I'm literally on the verge of tears whenever I think of the gym because of the commitment I made to myself and how I turned my life from a drug abusing alcoholic into a fit, active and STRONG individual. I was proud of where I was going, and some woman took it all away from me. The doctor just told me that even though I was in very good shape before the car accident (which wasn't even my fault) it will be a full year until I can even attempt a squat. I'm depressed. I won't see you guys for a year. I wake up every morning wishing I could lift, wanting to more than anything in the world to just be able to WALK straight again but that's going to take 8 weeks on crutches. I'm down.

Train like you've never trained before because someone, someday out of literally nowhere can come crashing into your life and take the ONE thing that was able to make you sane away from you.

Update:

You guys really inspired me to get out there an go for it today, so i went to the gym. During a set of dips, I came down on my leg kind of hard and may have broken it again. My doctor says that's probably what happenend from what I described to him, and that I will have to go to surgery again. I'll let anyone interested know what happens. Hopefully I didn't break it. And I love your inspiration. Thank you, every single one of you.



Update on the Update:

I did break my leg again, but thankfully will not need surgery. It just set me back about a week on recovery, but you will see me back in the gym the DAY my doctor allows me to. I promise.

1369070898.0,1277,self.Fitness,1epe58,Couples transformation - A year later. Update!,1817,540,260,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1epe58/couples_transformation_a_year_later_update/,"About a year ago I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/nhz3y/couples_transformation_soft_to_more_fit_in_a_year/) an update of the transformation my partner and I had gone through over the preceding year. I thought I would provide an update a year later and let you know how we're doing and what we've been doing.

First, here are some [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/vYwGQ) comparing the start two years ago to now. For reference, I'm 6'2"" (with glasses) and he's 5'8"".The middle shot of us together is actually from summer 2012, at the start of a 28 mile hike/race. Ironically, the before pictures are from the first hike we ever went on together... aside from the ""Super Hike"", last summer we did the arduous but beautiful 75 km West Coast Trail in British Columbia - we've come a long way! We both started out sedentary and unfit, although my partner was admittedly worse off at baseline than me. The details of our initial transformation are in the post outlined above. 

In the year since my first post we've really been working on refining things with diet and exercise. We now both work out 6 days per week, sometimes with multiple workouts on the same day (i.e., weight lifting in morning, cardio in evening). For weight lifting we do a four-day split (back-biceps, legs, chest-triceps, shoulders-abs) with dead lifts, squats, bench press, and overhead press being an first and anchor lift for each day. Cardio is done three days a week and is running or biking for 45 minutes.

My partner James (without glasses) has made it a psychological goal to get to a ""healthy"" BMI range (regardless of the relevance of that number, it has provided an arbitrary goal). The last 10 lbs (from around 174 in our last update, to 164 lbs (24.9 BMI) has been brutal though and very slow. There was significant loose skin and stubborn subcutaneous fat that will not budge even with drastic caloric restriction and cardio. A focus on weight lifting and building muscle mass to fill it in has thus been a priority. Skin on the arms and chest tightened up a lot. If he keeps it up I imagine that over the years things will improve even more.

For myself, I've been focusing on hypertrophy routine recently for accessory lifts while looking to increase strength for squat, bench, and deadlifts. I've been on a cut through the spring, so numbers have declined a bit. I don't really have any 1RM to share, but in the winter I was around 3x8 at 225 for squats, bench was around 3x8 at 175, and DL I can recall a max of 3x5 at 300 lbs. Nothing to brag about at all, but I remember not being able to complete 3x5 at 65 lbs squat when I started, so it's an improvement. I am sure that cardio and caloric deficits are not helping, but I also enjoy having a robust aerobic capacity  - being able to go balls to the wall on the bike for 45 min or run 5-7 miles easily is important to me, along with the cardiovascular health benefits.

As for nutrition, it's been a big focus on keeping protein high during the last year. We've been using MyFitnessPal. On a cut, I'm running about 2400 calories a day and losing a 1lb a week. around 2800-3000 I can maintain my weight. James has been struggling with these last lbs, but around 1200 calories has had him losing weight and his maintenance is around 1800. I've actually been trying to increase fat in my diet recently. I had a lipid panel completed, and while my LDL and triglycerides were very very low, my HDL was far below the normal range. I've been trying to add more dietary cholesterol from eggs and more saturated fat from higher fat dairy and meat to my diet to try and help. It's also possible I have a genetic disposition to low HDL, so I'll be interested to see during a retest in 6 months.

I'd be happy to answer any specific questions. We appreciate the wonderful resource of this subreddit and have utilized the advice, posts, and resources provided here countless times in this journey. Thanks!

**Edit #1:** Some have asked for it, so here is the generic template for my lifting schedule.

The sets and rep range change over time, might do low volume high weight for a few months then switch it up. Right now I'm in low weight high volume. 5x10-14 for most things. Squats are always 3x8 or 3x5 for strength. Hanging leg raises 3x20' Deadlifts 3x5.

Day 1: Bench, triceps extension, cable flyes, machine triceps, machine flyes, push-ups to failure (3xF).

Day 2: Squats, Hanging leg raises, side bends, calf raises, hamstring curl

Day 3: Deadlifts, chin ups (usually ladder: 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2... For four cycles, so 40 altogether), bicep curls, bent over row, lat pull down, seated row.

Day 4: Overhead press (usually dumbbell), face pull, lateral raise, front raise, hanging leg raises. 

**Edit #2:** Surprisingly, a lot of people are very interested in the shirt I'm wearing. They are the Mossimo Athletic fit t-shirts from Target. About $8-$10. They come in crew and v-neck. You can find them online or in their store. The one I am wearing is Indigo color.

I launched [Eat This Much](http://www.eatthismuch.com) last August and I got a ton of amazing feedback from our initial discussion ([seen here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/xq05o/just_launched_the_next_version_of_the_diet/)). This past Thursday, I launched a big update to the site that automatically sends subscribers an email every week with 7 meal plans and a grocery list, all while accomodating their nutrition targets, food tastes, schedule, and budget. For non-subscribers, I updated the meal options to accomodate more preset diet types and added a few hundred new user submitted recipes. Since the first posting, the algorithm has also gotten a bunch of updates and should be making much more reasonable meal combinations.

My favorite part about the update is the new template system. It lets you create a ""base"" meal plan for every day of the week, with its own unique cooking times or nutrition intake. It also lets you lock in any foods that you want to recur every week, so what I do is lock in the same oatmeal breakfast for every weekday morning, and then put longer cooking times for weekend meals. For the intermittent fasting/leangains crowd, you can set the calorie intake to be higher on your workout days and less on the non-workout days (though this does put you on a more rigid 7 day rotation).

Sorry if this comes across as too self promotional - it definitely is, but the feedback I got last time was fantastic and played a huge part in molding what the site has become today (especially since the site's first incarnation as [Swole.me](http://www.swole.me)). Most of the new features are subscriber only, but I added a free trial with the update and I won't be offended if you cancel right away. You'll still get to use it for the 14 days, and here's the url to cancel even: http://www.eatthismuch.com/unsubscribe/. There's also an unadvertised free account plan - just bail out of the signup after the first step, you can still save recipes, custom foods, and a few meal plans.

Once I realized that I hated having my picture taken because of how awkward I looked with my terrible posture and being out of shape I wanted to fix it. 

I started working out consistently in August 2011, 5 days a week with no set program, terrible nutrition, and bad form. Over the next 6 months I found /r/fitness and other weightlifting sites and quickly improved my nutrition and started doing a split body workout. The last 6 months  I slowly started cutting weight while still increasing all my lifts and added leg workouts as well (had a nagging knee injury and had to fix computer guy posture).

Weighted pullups

Deadlifts

Squats

Standing OHP

Shrugs

Ill add 1-2 lifts of whatever I struggled on the most during the week.

**Sunday**

Rest

**Extra Stuff**

I did not do most of SS due to learning about it in December and already having basic strength levels by then from HS wrestling and from lifting since August. I do highly recommend it to anyone starting lifting weights and I did some of the routines when first starting to workout my legs in January.

Also I haven't seen a progress post with tattoos but not sure if this has been addressed before but I have not seen any change in regards to stretching out or distortion of shape of my 4 tattoos. Only the bicep one looks different when I flex it and that is to be expected.

My next goals are to get to a lean 180lb/81kg and get the hard filled out look. I also want to hit the 1000lb club and get a bicep vein. 

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for me! Do I have any areas that need work? Is formatting and grammar ok?

I am sharing my story with you today in hopes to inspire you or someone you know to challenge yourself. Now when most people hear the word “challenge” they immediately think of something negative. However when I hear the word “challenge” I right away think of opportunity. Ever since I was born I have faced challenges, both physical and mental, but rather than allow them to be an obstacle in my life, I have worked with them to be in my favour. I have taken the wind that has blown on me, and adjusted my sail to determine where I want to go in life. This post is long, so bare with me. 
  
I was born in Sofia, Bulgaria. I spent the first two years of my life in and out of a girl’s orphanage while my birth mother struggled with deciding if she could keep me or not.  I was told she was so poor that she would steal food for us. On top of that I was born with some major health problems which would require intense surgery and thus big bucks. So she reluctantly put me up for adoption in hopes to give me a better life. I cannot begin to imagine how difficult that must have been for her and I hope to one day find her and tell her thank-you.

At 2 ½ years old I was adopted by two amazing **Canadians**, and brought *home* to Toronto. They welcomed me into their big family as one of their own smothering me with love. Most importantly, they got me the medical attention I needed.

I was born with a rare genetic disease called [Holt-Oram Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holt%E2%80%93Oram_syndrome). Basically **I was born with four fingers on each hand (no thumbs) and a hole in my heart.** It also effects your arm and shoulder development and range of motion is not great.  At three and four years old I had eight hour surgeries on both my hands to make me working thumbs. Then at age six I went in for open heart surgery to repair the hole in my right ventricle. My recovery road was long, both physically and mentally, but thankfully I had my awesome family supporting me the whole time. I remember having to play video games for hours to strengthen my new thumbs. 

When it was time to go to school it was bitter sweet. At first kids would make fun of me because I looked different. They called me things like four fingered freak or an alien. Then that gave me the idea for the perfect response when kids would ask me, **why do you only have four fingers?**  I replied with, “because I’m an alien!” Hahaha you should have seen the look on their faces as they went silent and then left me alone. It was great. On top of that I have two learning disabilities in reading and math. The two most basic skills needed for schooling. At one point I had TWO math tutors and pulled my grade up from 34% to 52%. My philosophy in school was 51 and go! Lol. I knew I was smart but I was frustrated that my grades did not always reflect the effort I put in. It upset me that I wasn’t “smart” according to school standards yet my creativity and problem solving skills were through the roof. It's safe to say that my life started as a messy uphill battle! Sure, I could have told myself I'm different and ugly and stupid but no I didn’t. My family did not raise me that way and I knew there must be good in this somewhere. That's when I realized, how I see the situation is all that really matters. At school I started to gain a lot of respect from my peers when I began accepting my differences as being *cool* and unique rather than weird. Being athletic and crushing physEd time also helped because then everyone wanted me on their team. So I made it through school, graduated with honours and became an Entrepreneur.
 
I ran my own painting franchise from age 18-23 (while attending University as a full time student) and became the first female in North America to produce $1 million dollars in residential painting in only 5 years. It was an amazing experience but because I started working so much I lost my focus regarding my health. It’s easy to do when life gets busy but I know how lucky I am to have been adopted and had these major surgeries done that I was not going to allow myself to let myself go or become unhealthy. That’s when I decided to take on another challenge! 

I decided I would train for a fitness competition for the first time. I had attended a show a year prior and I left wondering could I do what they did. How much discipline, training and work does it take to get to that level…the NEXT level? Since I’m naturally athletic I knew the lifting weights and being disciplined parts were not going to be the challenge. Walking in 5 inch stripper shoes and being elegant and graceful was going to be the hard part. So I did it! I set a goal, I used my support system for help, and I ate clean, trained hard and practiced often. I started out at 141.2lbs and 20% body fat and by day 90 I was 124.6lbs and 12% body fat. Although I did not place in my first show, my trophy is my new body and the healthy habits I developed along the journey. I cannot wait to take the feedback from the judges and get back to practicing so I can compete again next summer and crush the stage! Another benefit of this challenge is that by going way outside my comfort zone and challenging myself, it has led to another wonderful potentially life changing opportunity... 

[before / after album of my fitness transformation](http://imgur.com/a/B3MfE)

This brings us to my reason for this long post. I entered a contest to be on the cover of a North American wide fitness magazine. I am in the top 50, sitting around 28th, but I need more votes to get into the TOP 10 for a shot at winning. Once the **TOP 10 are decided as of Friday June 29th 2012 at midnight**, they will go to Miami, Florida where the final judging will take place. I made a drastic physical transformation in 90 days and I overcame a lot of obstacles to get to where I am today. I truly think I have a good chance at winning IF I can get into the top 10 by Friday midnight. However, to do so at this point is mostly a popularity contest since pre-judging is based solely on votes.  

So Reddit, thank-you for taking the time to read my story. I am grateful for this community and all the value it adds to my life. If my story has resonated with you in any way, please vote for me.

It's not a big or wide river, maybe 30 feet from edge to edge.  The ground slopes away at a very sharp angle however, to a rocky base about 15 feet down.  As fate dictated, he slipped down the muddy gravel bank and into the water.  Now, the water wasn't THAT fast or deep, but waist deep for him.  He landed fast first into the water, and panicked.  All he had to do was STAND UP.  He was going to drown in thigh deep water.  My son was going to die, right in front of me.  I flew down the bank, yanked him out of the water and onto my shoulders.  There was no way I could get up the bank with him, let alone me.  I had to walk about 1/8 mile downstream over these huge boulders to a footbridge.  I hoisted him over my head where he could take hold, and pushed him onto the bridge.  I then jumped up about a foot, grabbed the edge of the bridge, and pulled myself up.

If I didn't do pullups, upright rows, deadlifts, lunges, and overhead presses as part of my workout routine, there would be NO WAY I could have gotten him out of that river without help.  No way.  I always read these articles about practical strength, and the strength I needed to help my son I got from the gym.  

*edit*

I'm not posting this to have a bunch of people give me 'hero' love.  I was stupid to let him get that close to the edge after a rain, and damn lucky he didn't crack his head or worse.

Terrible at anything athletic.

Fast forward 25 years.  I'm 39.  Got two little boys, 6 and 4.  They mean more to me than anything I've ever had.  They look up to me like I'm some type of Jesus superman.  A few months ago, my 6 year old came home from first grade with a paper, ""What I want to be when I grow up.""  Know what he put?  ""I wanna be strong like daddy.""  Then at the bottom he drew us as a couple of Power Rangers.

That got to me.  I knew his love for me is unconditional, but one day he'll know that his dad, for lack of a better term, is a pussy.  I wanted him to look back at me in pictures and see his dad as a strong, confident man.  Because in turn, he'll become the same.  Like father like son, right?

So I started hitting the iron--every damn day.  It was intimidating as hell, that first month.  Although nobody ever gave me a hard time, every time I went to the weight room, hearing jockspeak and the hard clank of weights, I had flashbacks of freshman year gym class.  I've got no amazing progress pics, no massive amount of weight lost to show you...but I benched 135 ten times today.  Plates.  My vision blurred, my biceps shook and my back cramped putting up the last two, but fucking plates.  Reddit, I started off doing 5x5 with the _bar_.  I had to ask guys half my age and twice my size to spot me when I had 35s.  To me, being able to bench a plate on each side, signaled that I belonged in the gym.  That I wasn't a pussy anymore.

For the first time in my entire life, I felt strong.

You've helped so many people and everyone who contributes to this sub should be proud. 

I was a really active kid. I played soccer, baseball, tennis, and everything in between. I was looking forward to my first year of football when I started to limp home from every soccer practice. My parents brought me to the doctor and we find out I have something called leg calve perthes. It's a degenerative hip disease where the round hip bone loses its blood supply and essentially flattens out. 

So at 11 years old my options were to let the disease run its course and eventually get a hip replacement, or get corrective hip surgery. We decided on the surgery. Months of full body traction and a few in a wheel chair does a hell of a lot of damage to an active 11 year olds life. I got really bitter at all my friends who were still able to play sports. 

After a year or so when I was finally off crutches my doctor told me I would never be able to play contact sports. No football, no hockey, no lacrosse. I was devastated, and became a shut in. I played video games all the time and rarely went out with friends. At my biggest I weighed around 250-260 lb. 

My life was never really unhappy or bad. I had girlfriends, I had good friends, and I would do things outside. But I was always self conscious and missed sports. It was time to stop being bitter about the things I couldn't do. I found r/fitness and read everything I could. I started out with a change in diet and light exercise. With these small changes I lost 55 pounds in 3 months. 

But just loosing the weight wasn't enough. I want to be fit, and feel comfortable with my body again. So over the past month I've started the C25k program. I just finished week 5 day 3 and ran 2.2 miles in 20 minutes. It felt amazing. Sorry to talk so long I just had to get off my chest how good the afterglow of that run made me feel.

My next move is to either start weight training in my off days or starting p90x once I have built up my cardio strength a bit more. I'm also looking into local 5k, 10k, and Spartan races in the area that I can train for.

If you read [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) at all, you know who Mark Rippetoe is.  He was a competitive powerlifter for ten years. He's worked in the fitness industry since 1978, and is the owner of the Witchita Falls Athletic Club since 1984, after graduating from Midwestern State University in 1983 with a Bachelor of Science in geology and minor in anthropology.  He was in the first group certified by the National Strength and Conditioning Association as a CSCS in 1985, and the first to formally relinquish that credential in 2009.  He's perhaps most widely known as the author of influential books, including

I was told I would likely regain my ability to walk, but for everything else we would have to wait and see. I spent the next month and a half in the hospital doing physical/occupationally therapy 4 hours a day, everyday. By the time I was discharged, I could walk for quite a distance, but my hands were pretty much useless. I weighed [125lbs.](http://i.imgur.com/Gm7v6.jpg)

For the next year or so following my discharge I gained more and more strength in my hands. I was able to hold a 15lb dumbbell for a few seconds. 
I started lifting weights in August 2010. It was really difficult at first considering the condition of my hands, but I made it work. I bought straps to use for pulling exercises and they worked quite well. 

I spent the next year working out 4-5 times a week and by August 2011 I looked like [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/ANkae.jpg). I know it is nothing amazing, but I'm sure you guys are 'mirin my aesthetics. I have probably gained another 5lbs since these photos were taken. I'll post more pics if I get the energy.

I was finally convinced that weight training doesn't cause women to bulk the same way that men do, so I've given it a try.

Here is the difference after 2 months: http://i.imgur.com/xZOcXVz.jpg (slightly NSFW)

I'm not where I want to be yet but I'm VERY excited about the progress so far! Thank-you fittit for the constant support!

My weight training routine is something like this:

* Monday: Back/abs heavy
* Tuesday: Legs heavy
* Wednesday: bicep/tricep heavy, back/abs light
* Thursday: chest/ shoulders heavy, legs light
* Weekend: miscellaneous activities (swimming, watersports, hiking, yoga, etc.)

I also made some changes to my diet:

* started to drink enough water daily (and pee a lot more)
* cut out grain carbs (about 90%, I might have a sandwich on the weekend)
* minimized dairy

Otherwise, I basically eat veggies, fruit, the occasional potato or yam, poultry, and a TON of fish (mainly salmon) and eggs.

EDIT: formatting

EDIT 2: I'll take another shot later today in the same spot as the original photo with the same lighting, bathing suit, etc. for a better comparison.

EDIT 3: I've been asked for a breakdown of my workout routine. It honestly varies a little, depending on my mood/energy levels, but this is a general overview: (sorry, I don't know all the technical terms of everything)

**MONDAY**

* Leg raises (knees 90 degrees) 3 sets of 10
* 5 minute ab routine: 1 min regular plank, 1 min left side plank, 1 min right side plank, 2 min on back w/ legs 6 inches off ground (2-3 sets of this routine)
* Abdominal hip thrusts on gym bench, 3 sets of 10
* Back extensions w/ 10 lb, 3 sets of 10
* Row (60 lb), 3 sets of 10
* Lat pull-down (60 lb), 3 sets of 10
* TRX plank ab curnches, 3 sets of 20 (10 strait in, 5 left, 5 right)

**TUESDAY**

* Squats (50lbs, going up next week), 3 sets of 10
* Walking lunges w/ 20 lb in each hand, 3 sets of 20 steps (so 10 on each leg)
* Hamstring curls (60 lb), 3 sets of 10
* Quad machine (don't know what it's called) (20 lb), 3 sets of 10
* TRX hip thrusts, 3 sets of 10
* no deadlifts yet, I still need someone to show me how to do them safely and I'm too scared to ask anyone, I'll get a trainer soon

**WEDNESDAY**

* Bicep curls 8lb (bottom half 10, top half 10, complete curl 10... do continually) 3 sets of 30
* Standing overhead tricep extension (25lb), 3 sets of 10
* Assisted pull up (40 lb assistance), 3 sets of 10
* Assisted tricep dips (40 lb assistance), 3 sets of 10
* Back extensions w/ 10 lb weight, 3 sets of 10
* Leg raises (knees at 90 degrees), 3 sets of 10
* Abdominal hip thrusts on gym bench, 3 sets of 10

**THURSDAY**

* Shoulder Raises to side (8lb), 3 sets of 10
* Shoulder raises to front (8lb), 3 sets of 10
* Laying down dumb bell chest press parallel (20lb), 3 sets of 10
* Laying down dumb bell chest press perpendicular (20lb), 3 sets of 10
* Squats (50lb), 3 sets of 10
* Walking lunges w/ 20 lb in each hand, 3 sets of 20 steps (so 10 on each leg)

For cardio, I typically run to the gym and back (2.5 km each way) and I also stop and do stairs on the way (103 stairs, up/down 3-10 times, depending on my mood). When I want to do more than 20 minutes of cardio, I either swim, get on my road bike, or use the elliptical because I broke my pelvis last year and can't handle impact for extended periods of time.

Will answer as best I can if anyone has any questions! Cheers. 

*edit* added routine/diet info

Hey guys, I probably should have put this in the OP - diet when cutting heavily (the first 3 months) was around 60% protein 40% carb/fat @ 1300-1500 calories per day, on average. During this time I did daily cardio (bike) and lifting via machines; smith machine type bench, flyes, etc. Around the 3rd month I decided I needed to step up my game and invested in a proper set of weights and a lifting cage - I stopped doing cardio every day and reserved it more for those days which I wasn't lifting. The first few months I'm sure I overtrained; lifting daily with Saturday or sunday off when I wasn't too sore. More recently, I've been focusing on routine/split exercise days - chest/shoulders day 1, back/legs day 2, arms/abs/misc (anything I feel like, new exercises,etc) day 3, day 4 off/cardio",,False,,t5_2qhx4,True,,,True,t3_l170r,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/l170r/9_month_progress_in_photos/,

My last Reddit post was not very organized and ended up answering questions mid-thread so I'll try to cover stuff up front to save y'all the trouble (but obviously feel free to ask whatever you want). This will be my last Reddit update because I really don't think there's going to be much more in the way of major progress worth posting about from this point on. Again, thanks to /fit which I leeched tons of helpful info from.


About Me and Stuff

Well, nothing really special about me. I was a dude who used to be pretty fat, lost weight, then started the (endless?) journey to aesthetics. Age 30. The scar on my stomach is from an operation I had as a child (called Pyloric Stenosis - essentially, stomach valve issue). 6'1. Live in Toronto ON area (any North York Goodlife people? Need someone to train with now that I'm up here...). Am a professional photographer for a living thus the cameras in many of the pics.


Supplements?

Protein whey - only when I can't get enough protein via regular foods or need something in a serious hurry.
Pre-W/O - Not anymore. Cold coffee is always in the fridge though, so maybe caffeine.
EC Stack - I'm a fan, but find I can usually only run it for around 2 weeks at a time before I start to get jittery. 


What I've Learned

Well, it's been a heck of a journey trying to get into shape, and if I was me starting all over again, this is what I wish I had known..

a) Weight fluctuates so wildly that weighing in more then once every 1-2 weeks will do more harm then good.


b) Essentially every celebrity, muscle/fitness mag, bb.com guy I admired as a goal physique I later found out to be cycling steroids, and especially in regards to fitness articles and websites, it was an essential part of how they looked (aside from image editing and of course hard work). Entirely frustrating looking at a '6 month' transformation and wondering why I didn't add 25lbs of lean mass like someone else did. The cop-out of 'well, person X just worked harder/was more dedicated then you' was a kick in the balls, especially with comments including ""..I didn't really watch my 
diet - I just ate clean everything and lifted heavy!"". Fuck you, supplement and fitness industry. Seriously.


c) It is very difficult to ever be completely satisfied, so just enjoy any improvements. When I first cut down, I felt too skinny…too small. Bulked up, too fat. Cut down but still bigger, felt 'sloppy'. Right now I'm just trying to be happy - I am 200-205lbs and lightly visible abs, and as opposed to thinking 'i'm not shredded enough', I compare how I look @ 205lbs now to how I did years ago. (though I am on a cut now...hah! ..:\ ).


d) If you dedicate yourself to losing weight and getting in shape, people will claim you are on steroids; and certainly if you lose weight and wear backwards baseball hat in one of your photos, people will claim you became a douchebag as well.


e) I cannot do cheat days well, because they turn into cheat weeks, and I end up set back farther then I ever would have alotted for.



How Has Your Life Changed

Probably the most common non-training related question I get is this, and I hope it serves as motivation, perhaps even a warning in some respects?

Firstly, every guy wants to know how females react, and in my experience, it is literally night and day difference. Attribute it to confidence gained due to the physique change, perhaps, but I am *not* an attractive looking guy and I find myself on the receiving end of attractive female attention more regularly. I am in a very happy and awesome relationship now, but if I wasn't, I have no doubt that I would do far better with girls now then I ever did in college (or any other time).

Secondly, exercise is simply a part of day to day; like going to work or brushing your teeth, if the sun rises, I will make time to exercise. Of course exceptions such as special events, etc exist, but the longest I didn't train was 2 weeks during a trip to Seoul. It becomes a part of your life.

FInally, the confidence you gain after this type of training over time really is the best reason to stick with it. My work, social, family life - 
everything has benefitted from training.  People are more easily influenced and talked to when someone stands tall/strong/fit; for example, a nervous new model hesitant to try a pose or whatever is put more at ease when I talk to them. 

An odd side note, ever since my Reddit post (which was subsequently posted on 9Gag and then a ton of other places), I experienced a small bit of e-fame; my transform shots were ripped off for fitness websites, blogs, you name it. My girlfriend got a call from one of her friends in Korea saying my pics were on a main post of Naver (Korean website; gf = Korean). I was actually recognized on two separate occasions on the street….the whole thing has been somewhat bizarre.  You'll notice an obnoxious watermark on some images because fitness pages have literally stolen them to promote their gyms, personal training, whatever. Jimmies rustled to see the pic get 15.6k Likes but my own page has 800 or so...but certainly ego-boosting.


Training, Nutrition Etc

One thing that has not really changed much over this year has been the weight/amount I can lift. My 1RM on bench is still 255lbs or so and I don't know if that will ever change naturally; deadlift maxed out at 415lbs, squat (with proper form) 305lbs. I had a 305lb squat for a long time before I realized how bad my form was; had to drop the weight and work my way back up. These numbers, however, have been stagnant for easily 6 months now, and I don't anticipate that changing. Interestingly, I'd since moved to the city and was using a crappy gym in the condo; 1 all-in-one machine and minimal free weights. This had forced me to train a lot less compounds then I'm used to (dumbbell presses for chest balanced on a yoga ball because there is no bench for example..) but a bunch of my other lifts have improved; dumbbell curls, leg presses, etc. I've been forced to do more reps (10-14) as opposed to heavier weights so I can really feel Ive got a good workout. I now, for the first time ever, have a real gym membership, and it's been awesome.


Currently I train 6 times a week usually, 1 day is cardio; 1 rest day, sometimes two depending on work. 1 day is chest, one legs, shoulders, arms/back, one 'other' misc day (I use a rowing machine a lot now on 'off' days)


Bulking - I tried a fairly controlled bulk from around...Oct or so, starting to cut back around feb. I got up to 225lbs (am sitting around 205lbs now); if I made any muscle gains, I don't see them in the mirror so for me, it'll be leangains only unless I ever use gear because - though I felt stronger - carrying around this extra bulk only to have to lose it again for, maybe, 1-3lbs gain? Just not worth it to me.
I estimate my maintenance to be approximately 2500 calories; cutting at 2k. Regarding diet (especially cutting), the intermittent fasting is the only way I can consistently keep on track; I think I'll forever be a guy who needs to eat bigger meals for satiety, and that approach lets me do it.


Finally, what would this post be without self-promotion? I have a Facebook page **www.facebook.com/jeremyclayfitness** as well as a webpage www.jclayfitness.com - I just post meals/macros/routines and exercise stuff to help people day to day, and answer questions there too. I don't have anything I'm promoting, selling, or am being endorsed/sponsored by, just trying to be helpful with information where I can. I truly feel being in good shape has been a giant positive change in my life, and if I can help anyone else do the same, I'm glad to do so; though as I'm not using it for income, sometimes updates can lag.


Also, yeah, AMA, because my intentions for this post and the end result are not the same.


**hold on, that is a lot of text above, and I don't think I said anything that I wanted to. Let me try and precis this for what I want it to accomplish**


Are you fat? Kind of fat? Lazy? Whatever? Stop eating so much. Find out how much you need to eat (in calories, not 'food types') to be losing weight, and track your food. It sucks balls. It's boring, it makes your life inconvenient, and people will think you are retarded for putting your peanut butter on a scale before onto your bread. If you want to continue to be fat and out of shape, continue to care what they think, but there's a reason why being in shape is an exception and not the rule. Also, start exercising, preferrably with weights but start with whatever you have. There is tons of exercise routines online, and if you do any of them hard over a period of time, you will see results. 5x5 or madcow or whatever, I don't know, but if you lift weights over time, you will get results if your diet is close to in check. It is easy in it's simplicity but requires your absolute, 100% dedication, every day.
I didn't start lifting weights because I didn't like my stigmas I associated with 'those types' of people...I didn't want to be a 'muscle head', I didn't want to walk around like a caveman...so often I had mocked people who were in shape due to my own neglected body, to the point where I started to believe what I'd joke about. Truth was, I didn't want to feel inadequate, I didn't want to fail, or look weak, or be made fun of for trying...but I also couldn't live with who I was any longer. The sooner you stop giving a damn about what other people think and get to work, however, the better. Oh how much I wished I'd lived this lifestyle earlier...start now.

That said, there are a lot of improvements to the old diet generator:
 
 * Way more intelligent algorithm
 * Recipes (only about 100 so far)
 * Improved generator options

The limited recipe selection can become pretty noticeable if you have very strict meal options, but I'm adding more every chance I get. You can also help out by submitting your own (under the ""Custom recipes"" section in the ""Add a dish"" menu).

There's definitely a lot of work to be done, like adding recipe reviews, finer generating controls, etc. What's up now is the bare minimum I felt comfortable releasing. Try it out and let me know what you think!

Many people asked for me to post again throughout my journey. So, considering there are probably many new people here with 2013 resolutions AND I hit my 100 days mark, here are some updates.

Nutrition: Still at 1450 cal. However, I have increased my protein intake from 440 cal to almost 600 cal, and on lifting days I give myself 400-500 more calories. Trying to eat ""clean"" though I still eat skinny cow ice cream and peanutbutter if I think I've earned it, haha :)

Fitness: I'm finishing my cut. Only about 5-6 lbs left to lose. Cardio is cut down from 5-6 days a week to only about 2-3. My splits are Chest and Tri, Back Biceps Shoulders, and Legs. 


I have been doing compound/strong lifts for 6 weeks.

Deadlift: 65lbs to 165lbs.
Squat: 45lbs to 95lb 1RM.
Bench: 45lbs to 65lbs.

-----------------------

I moved out and lived with an awesome roommate. I was around 280 lbs. We went splits on pizza every two or three days. I just looked up the pizza calories on the dominos website and calculated accordingly.  
  
One large 14"" pizza with sausages, pepperoni, and XL pepperoni is 2690 calories, with 370 calories per slice. Since I am 6'4 and 280 lbs, I calculated my BMR to be 2630 calories using [this](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/) calculator. For a week I ate one of these large pizzas per day which came out to $33.99 total for 3 large 3 topping pizzas, so around $14 a day, Dominos was around the corner from my apartment so it wasn't much for a days worth of food. I was gaining 2lbs a week from 1pizza/day, so I cut it in 3/4ths. Eating 6 slices/day had me at maintenance over a two week period, so I went down to 4 slices a day which cost me $8/day @ 1480 calories.
  
I did SS 3x a week along with running every other day and doing accessory lifts on Sundays. On weekends I ate loads of fruit and usually cooked myself a steak, sweet potatoes, rice, chicken totaling 3000+ calories/day as my ""cheat"" meal. During weekdays I did 3 pizza slices/day, and a half liter of chocolate milk post workout. 1 slice sounds like little but these were big slices with loads on them. 
  
I essentially did IF. I ate from 2pm (when my classes end) until 8pm creating an 18 hour fast.    
  
This diet was also amazing because I started smoking weed in university so it worked out from every angle, that is partly what inspired it.
  
**tldr; In a little under 3 months I lost 65 LBS eating mainly pizza and chocolate milk while doing SS and running. I also felt like shit during the week.**

1368384977.0,1163,self.Fitness,1e72y5,Re-activating and strengthening the gluteal muscles,1477,314,142,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1e72y5/reactivating_and_strengthening_the_gluteal_muscles/,"Introduction

The gluteus maximus is the strongest and biggest muscle of the body. The gluteus maximus is not only a hip extensor but also plays an important role in pelvic and spinal stabilisation and proper leg alignment (Snijders et al. 1993). 
The gluteus maximus allows us to maintain an upright position needed for bipedalism. Through evolution the gluteus maximus enlarged in humans as a means to stabilise the trunk while standing and counteract the high impact forces that tend to flex the trunk anteriorly during running and sprinting. Consequently the glute muscles gradually lose tone during our chair-laden lifestyle (Marzke et al. 1988). The terms ‘gluteal amnesia’ and ‘sleeping giant’ probably sound familiar.  These terms refer to inhibition and delayed activation of the gluteal muscles, which in time leads to weakness of these muscles. Gluteal inhibition negatively affects performance and lower body strength and is a root cause for many injuries and chronic pain.
Due to our lifestyle, low back pain or lower body injuries our glutes may be inhibited and do not fire when they are supposed to. 
What is the last time your glutes felt really sore after a workout? Many athletes and lifters don’t know how to turn on the glutes, because the compensation pattern to get around using the glutes are so engraved. 
This article focuses on exercises that address the major functions of the glutes and result in the greatest level of glute activation. These exercises will help to switch your glutes back on and re-establish correct muscle recruitment patterns. Re-activating your glutes will positively affect every compound lower body lift, improve your core stability, prevent lower-body injuries and enhance sport performance.      
     
    
The gluteus maximus and lower back stability

Activating and strengthening the glutes needs to form an important part of your core routine.
Co-contraction of the gluteus maximus with the psoas major (part of iliopsoas muscle) contributes to lumbo-sacral stabilization (Gibbons 2005). The gluteus maximus provides stability to the sacroiliac joint (SI joint) by bracing and compression (Snijders et al. 1993). Excess movement at the SI joint would compromise the L5-S1 intervertebral joints and disc and could lead to SI joint dysfunction and low back pain.
The gluteus maximus also provides lower back stability through its connection with the erector spinae and toraco-lumbar fascia (Vleeming et al. 1995). Some of its fibres are continuous with the fibres of the erector spinae. A contraction of the gluteus maximus will generate tension in the erector spinae muscle on the same side, providing stiffness to the spinal column (Snijders et al. 1997). 
Gluteus maximus contraction also exerts a pull on the lower end of the thoraco-lumbar fascia, which is a thick layer of ligamentous connective tissue. Tightening of this fascia stabilises the vertebras. 
People with low back pain often have weak and deconditioned glutes (Kankaanpää et al. 1998). Lengthened gluteal muscles as a result of our sitting lifestyle leads to a decreased stabilising function in the gluteus maximus (Richardson et al. 1991). This can result in compensation by the lower back and more altered muscular firing patterns and function.     
     
    
Inhibition of the gluteal muscles   


Low back pain has been associated with inhibition of the gluteus maximus (Leinonen et al. 2000). The activation of the gluteus maximus during hip extension is delayed in people with a history of low back pain compared to people with no back pain. In people with low back pain hip extension is initiated by the hamstrings and erector spinae instead of the gluteus maximus (Nelson-Wong et al. 2012). Even after the episode of low back pain has resolved, the altered firing patterns in the gluteus maximus remain (Ferreira et al. 2004). 
People suffering from ankle sprain injuries also have been shown to have reduced activation levels of the gluteus maximus (Bullock-Saxton et al. 1994).
In the case of low back pain, ankle and probably all lower body injuries, rehabilitation needs to focus on re-activating the gluteal muscles.     
     
     
Weak or inhibited gluteal muscles contribute to injury

Weak or delayed activation of the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius is a root cause for many injuries and chronic pain:   
   
- Hamstring strains:  Due to delayed gluteus maximus activity, the hamstring muscles become dominant during hip extension, which can cause hamstring strains (Sahrmann 2002). A lot of athletes that pulled a hamstring keep suffering re-injuries despite their focus and efforts to strengthen the hamstrings. They are reinforcing a compensation pattern instead of reactivating their inhibited glutes. Shirley Sahrmann said, ""Any time you see an injured muscle, look for a weak synergist.” A synergist is a muscle that performs the same joint motion.   
- Low back pain: Gluteus maximus activation plays an important role in stabilising the pelvis during the task of lifting (Noe et al. 1992). Delayed gluteus maximus activation also causes excessive compensation of the back extensors (Nelson-Wong et al. 2012).   
- Anterior knee pain: The excessive internal rotation of the femur as a result of glute weakness increases the pressure on the patellar cartilage (Tyler et al. 2006).   
- Anterior hip pain: Decreased force production from the gluteus maximus during hip extension is associated with increased anterior translation of the femur in the acetabulum. The increased femoral anterior glide could lead to increased force and wear and tear on the anterior hip joint structures (Cara et al. 2007)   
- Lower-body malalignment: Weak glutes results in increased internal rotation of the femur, knee valgus and foot pronation (Lephart et al. 2002).   
- Gluteal weakness also has been associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) sprains (Hewett et al. 2006), chronic ankle instability (Friel et al. 2006), and iliotibial friction syndrome (Fredericson et al. 2000).     
      
     
Exercises to re-activate the gluteal muscles

The gluteus maximus is especially active during stair climbing, running and activities that involve stabilising the trunk against flexion (McLay et al. 1990, Stern et al. 1980). An exercise that combines these movements would trigger a strong contraction of the gluteus maximus and addresses both the stabilising and movement role. Single-leg exercises require frontal plane pelvic stability (resisting gravity’s hip adduction torque), together with a control of the stance leg in the frontal (preventing adduction of the thigh) and transverse plane (preventing internal rotation of the thigh), which results in a high neural drive to the gluteus maximus, medius and other muscles of the lateral system.   
   
[Resisted slide-board back lunge](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/resisted-slide-board-back-lunge):   
   
- the cable creates a hip flexion force against which the gluteus maximus has to stabilise    
- The movement mimics the hip action of running and stair climbing. Like in running, the body has to be pulled over the foot by a powerful hip extension.    
- Single-leg stance
-	Advanced progression: Combining this exercise with a shoulder press emphasizes the stabilising role of the gluteus maximus even more.

[Single-leg squat](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/single-leg-box-squat) and [single-leg Romanian deadlift](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/single-leg-romanian-deadlift):   
   
- These single-leg exercises require concentric or eccentric hip extension throughout a large range of motion.

[Single-leg squat &amp; pull](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/single-leg-squat-pull) and [single-leg Romanian deadlift &amp; pull](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/single-leg-romanian-deadlift-pull):   
   
- In these exercises the hand opposite to the stance leg is loaded. The added rotary force stimulates the external rotator capability of the gluteus maximus and medius and gives these exercises a multi-planar character. The glutes need to stabilise the hip in the frontal (resisting gravity’s hip adduction torque) and transverse plane (preventing internal rotation of the thigh) and generate movement in the sagittal plane (concentric/eccentric hip extension).    
- These exercises train the cross-body connection ([posterior oblique system]( http://functionalresistancetraining.com/articles/inner-and-outer-unit)), that transmits forces from the ground through the leg and hip, across the SI-joint via the thoracodorsal fascia, into the opposite lattisimus dorsi.

[Superband X walk](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/superband-x-walk):    
    
- This exercise combines hip extension and hip abduction and requires stabilization of the trunk against flexion, which are all major functions of the gluteus maximus.   
- This exercises also trains the cross-body connection.

[Side bridge with abuction](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/side-bridge-with-abduction):   
   
- High activation levels of the gluteus medius, upper part of the gluteus maximus and lateral system muscles have been observed during the side bridge and the side bridge with abduction exercises (Selkowitz et al. 2012).

[The slide-board lateral slide](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/slide-board-lateral-slide):    
    
- This exercise combines a powerful hip extension and abduction and really activates the gluteus maximus, medius and minimus. Skating develops and shapes the hips and glutes best.

Edit: Thanks guys for the positive comments and I see some good discussions on which I want to comment here.     
Some interpret this post as OR squats OR some of the exercises listed here. But it’s an AND, AND story. To quote indiecore: “I found that squats helped my running and running helped my squat.” Knee-dominant squats will help single-leg strength (better glute activation) and vice versa. From my own training experience and the athletes I work with I see that these exercises boost squat performance and that increased squat strength transfers to increased performance. Squats are, like the bench press is for the upper body, a great exercise to create an overload of the lower body musculature.    
Squats are knee-dominant and when you combine them with a hip-dominant exercise you maintain an optimal balance between glute, hamstring and quad strength. The exercises above will help you correct possible compensation patterns. Research shows that a muscle focus results in higher EMG activity of the muscles involved in the movement, but in a lower total force output. This is clearly contra-productive for performance and strength gains. From my experience I believe goal-oriented movement has a lot better results to improve strength and performance.   
   
I’ll give a few examples of squats combined with the exercises listed above.    
    
Workout 1:    
Bulgarian split squat:       
   

- 1 x 6 reps@ (bodyweight) (@ means each leg).  
- 1 x 6 reps@ (60% 1RM)   
- 2 x 5 reps@ (70% 1RM)   
- 2 x 3 reps@ (80% 1RM)    
    
Front or back squat (full ROM):   
  
- 4 x 4 reps (80% 1RM)   
   
Single-leg Romanian deadlift &amp; row:   
   
- 1 x 8 reps@ (60% 1RM)   
- 3 x 6 reps@ (70% 1RM)   
   
Workout 2:    
  
Side bridge with abduction: great for neural activation of the glutes at the start of the workout.  
   
- 3 x 6-8 reps@   
   
Front or back squat (full ROM):    
   
- 1 x 6 reps (60% 1RM)   
- 3 x 6 reps (70% 1RM)    
   
Slide-board resisted back lunge: You don’t need a slide-board, you can use small towel or Val-slide or just perform a resisted back lunge.   
   
- 4 x 8RM @

My 6 month cut progress.,1728,564,364,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/14o0tx/who_says_asians_are_tiny_my_6_month_cut_progress/,"First off with the stats: I'm 23 M, roughly 5'10.5, 5'11 on a good day. Although I was always active and lifted, I never really watched my weight. I was always that ""fat kid"". I used to be one of those nay sayers that thought I could never lose weight because it was genetics wah wah wah. Then I told myself ""C_Terror you could cry and be a little bitch, or you could man up and do something about it.""

I found /r/loseit and /r/fitness and basically got started from there. (Seriously, fittit's FAQ is beastly). I ate at a caloric deficit + ate protein at roughly my weight in grams. Myfitnesspal was a godsend.

First the Pictures:

[Before, in June, 215 pounds] (http://imgur.com/vceeJ)

[After, December, 178 pounds] (http://imgur.com/CiAov)

I went from 215 to roughly 178, and my body fat % dropped from 26% to ~13% (used with calipers).

My big three lifts (have herniated my spine twice) 

Bench: ~225 to 325
Deadlifts: ~135 to 365
Squats: ~95 to 275

My Summer routine consisted of:

Monday: 5K run

Tuesday: Back + Biceps
- Deadlifts
- Pullups/Assisted Pullups
- Bent over Rows
- Dumb bell rows
- Hammer Curls
- Preacher Curls
- Ab rollers

Wednesday: 5K run 

Thursday: Chest + Triceps
- Flat barbell bench
- Inclined dumb bell bench
- Dips/Assisted Dips
- Cable crosses
- Tricep pull downs
- Weighted Ab pull downs

Friday: 5K run

Saturday: Rest day

Sunday: Legs + Shoulders
- Squats
- Leg Extensions
- Leg Curls 
- Calf Raises
- OHP
- Clean + Jerk 
- Shrugs
- Sitting Dumbbell Raises
- Ab rollers

Now that it's winter, I go to the gym Sunday - Thursday and spread my workout through 5 days instead of 3 (stopped cardio).

My next steps are to cut down to ~10% BF at 170, and to hit that 1K on the big three lifts. Once I get those, I want to learn how to do muscle ups, human flag, and to dunk. Oh how I'm looking forward to dunking a basketball. 

**EDIT** Many people were asking about my Bench numbers because it seemed unbelievable, here's a copy and paste from one of my comments below:

""My original 1RM on the Bench was 325+ a couple years ago, before I got injured and stopped lifting. The 225 was what my 1RM when I first started cutting.
I kept most of my LBM during my cut (It was a very clean protein heavy cut), so I think it was my muscles getting back to what I was before.
Wasn't too much programming, just kept pushing myself and kept pumping myself up with every new 1RM. Every bench workout is pure total hypertrophy until I can barely bench the bar and I feel like I'm puking. I'm not too sure how much bro science I'm spitting, but that's what worked for me.""

**EDIT v2** Many people are also asking about examples of diet. 

I was extremely strict with my diet in the first month; a typical day was:

Breakfast: 1 cup of Kashi grain cereal (~70 calories), 1 cup of coffee

Lunch: 1 chicken breast seasoned with montreal steak spice + srirarcha and handful of arugula and baby spinach

Mid Afternoon: 2 scoops of protein shake with cold water

Dinner: 10 oz steak with 3 eggs

I'd average ~8-10 cups of water a day.

However, I still live with my parents, and cooking my own food at dinner time, especially in an Asian household wouldn't last. I slowly regressed to eating whatever my mom made (generally pretty healthy) while cutting off the rice. I'd make rough estimations on how much calories each dish was, and in my mind proportion them accordingly. Luckily, my parents were very understanding and didn't give me too much shit for not eating rice. I cook my own food at lunch when I'm at work (also saves a lot of money from going out to buy).

Slowly, my diet regressed to eating whatever the fuck I want as long as I stick to two rules: Meet my Calorie limit + eat my protein (180 grams). I've had a week where I had Mc Gangbangs for lunch for 3 days but still lost  a pound. 

If I'm really craving something (i.e. Fries) I learned a littly trick from /r/loseit, where I would have a couple fries, then eat a fuck ton of vegetables/drink a lot of water, then top it off with a couple more fries. Got my fix, tricked my body into thinking I ate a lot of fries, and caloric damage was negligible. 

**EDIT V3**

Hey, I'd just like to thank you guys for the encouraging comments; Hopefully, if I motivated some of you a tiny fraction of what this subreddit and loseit has done for me, I'm happy.

I'll also try to post a video of my bench the next time I go for a 1RM to quell all doubts.

*Edit to add diet and exercise

As for diet, I started off with gradual changes.  Things like less sweets, no soda, and the alike.  I've tried many diet plans along the way and by far the best is the one I am doing now.  

The rules for my current diet are:

Eat slightly under TDEE

No processed food

Limit sodium to under 2000mg

Limit sugars to under 25g 

Really try to stick to as natural food as possible

Exercise:

The bulk of my weight came off with running 5-6 days a week or more.

I tried to run/jog 2 miles a day (of course I walked a lot of it until I was able to run it).

For a few months I ran 2 miles twice a day.

Currently I lift 5-6 days a week and try to run a mile after lifting.

This is a weightlifting progress post: be aware that I'm still firmly in the ""beginner"" camp. If this doesn't interest you, stop reading here, please :-)

In all honesty, I *only* started going to the gym because I was trying to get in my gym buddy's pants - but I got hooked on lifting somewhere along the way.  I made an introductory post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ibeo7/weightlifting_starting_from_ground_zero_and_i/) at the beginning of July. I am still working on my big original goals but I am a hell of a lot closer now!

My routine is pretty straightforward: I go to the gym 3 times a week. Each session I do deadlift or squat; bench or OHP; and dips or pull-ups (I alternate between each of these pairs). When I can do five sets of five reps at a given weight, I add five pounds and begin again. The exception is deadlift, in which I've been recently doing less volume (such as 1x5). I also do rows and occasionally do other assistance exercises, mostly tricep stuff.

My numbers:

 - Age 26, 5'8'', 137 lbs.  My weight has stayed constant since I began lifting

 - Deadlift: started at 5x5 @ 75lb, now at 1x3 @ 140

 - Squat: 5x5 @ 15-lb barbells; now at 5x5 @ 85.  Took me *ages* to get my form down right, and it's still my weakest lift

 - Bench: 5x5 from 45 to 75

 - OHP: 5x5@35 to 5x3 @ 55.  I've been stuck at 55 for a while - but it helped to switch around my routine so that I'm not doing it right after I deadlift

 - Dips: 5x5 from 61 lbs of assistance to 16

 - Pull-ups: 5x5 from 70 lbs of assistance to 28

Challenges: My biggest one is sleep. I work from home so it's really tough for me to maintain a normal work/sleep schedule, but I'm getting better at it! 

I had always thought I had a pretty healthy diet and a good relationship with food, so it surprised me to discover how much diet-related bullshit I had internalized.  For example: for a long time, if 2 pm rolled around and I realized I hadn't eaten anything yet that day, my first reaction wouldn't be ""Montereyo, you idiot""; it would be, ""Gee, good for you!""  I'm definitely getting better, though - I make myself eat breakfast *every* morning, even though I'm not usually hungry until later. I also load up on protein.  I love cottage cheese, unlike most of you here :-)

I saw old dudes in there that I know have been doing maintenance curls with 60's and 70's for months picking up 90's and 100's.
Awesome!

This got out of control quickly. 
I seriously intended for this to be a criticism of motivation.
I struggle with that ethereal volition on occasion and I found it interesting how all of the sudden that well of power can just rip it's lid off and Gush foward.

I was always a fatter kid in highschool (weighted 220lbs my senior year) but after college I had completely let myself go and tipped the scale at 282lbs. 

I called up a friend and we started P90x together the next week. 
This is where I started: [Pic](http://imgur.com/NgjU9)
I was so embarrassed to take this picture but now I'm glad I did. 

Over the next year I cut (stayed around 2000 calories a day a kept my protein around 1g/lb and did some variation of P90x and these were my [results](http://imgur.com/CUpjH) [bonus](http://imgur.com/L3zvFFd) from January. 

In September last year I also ran my first 5k in 24:17 and actually placed 3rd in my age group. I ran the first mile without stopping (very slowly) in June of last year.

At the end my P90x journey I had lost 100 lb and weighed 182lbs and was very happy with my progress but I wasn't finished.

At the end of January me and some friends got hired as coaches for our High School football team and I was tasked with strength and conditioning. 

The program I came up with was:

Mondays:

Squat (3x5)

Deadlift (1x5)

Bench (3x5)

Decline Bench (2x12-15)


Wednesday

DB Lunges (3x8)

OHP (3x5)

Pullups (3xMax)

Power Cleans (3x6)


Friday

Squat (3x5)

Incline Bench (3x5)

Bent Over Rowa (3x5)

Dips (3x8 weighted)

I followed this proram myself to prove to the kids it would work but I was also training for a half marathon in March, which I ran in 1:57:12, so my gains weren't great but it also meant I could eat more. I got a little carried away and by the end of May I had put on 23lbs, back up to 205lbs. I stayed around 3000 calories a day. Weekends became a free-for-all of eating all the terrible things I hadn't had in a year.

 Once I cut back on running my strength shot up. I never really maxed anything but by the end of May my lifts were:

Bench (245x5)

High bar squat (295x5)

Deadlift (345x5)

OHP (70lb DBx5) I have some shoulder issues and DB's seems to work better for me.

I'm aware my bench is higher compared to my other lifts but I was a bench bro in HS and college. It's by far my favorite exercise.

Here's a [pic](http://imgur.com/Tc1qiSA) from the beginning of my cut.

We switched to a 4 day split when we started summer conditioning. 

Monday - Shoulders and Triceps	
	
OHP	(3x5)

I come from a lifetime of poor eating habits, but throughout the last half of 2011 I really lost control, eating away a self-diagnosed ""depression""  with whole pizzas, thousands of calories at each meal, and a blatant disregard for my well being. Not only would I eat way too much at each meal, but I'd be mentally planning out the next. I would base my days around what or where I was going to eat, I would fantasize at night about different things, often giving to the cravings. While I don't know if it would be a medically diagnosed addiction, I definitely felt unable to break the cycle and just kept getting bigger and bigger. 

To keep my story short, I watched the documentary ""Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead"" in December, deciding I would do the two month juice fast starting in January. I made it about it a week (I started dry heaving and getting physically sick from the green concoctions) but was dedicated to improving my life still and losing the pounds. I was already a vegetarian, but I began limiting cheese, carbs, and dairy intake, dramatically reducing portion sizes, etc. For the last two months I've completely cut out cheese and have been going to the gym four-five days a week, running a mile each day and doing the ""Strong Lifts"" program. I eat a lot of beans and nuts and fruits and vegetables and blah blah. I still eat out, I still eat ""fun"" but without the heaviness, without the guilt, and with half the calories I may have eaten once before. 

Anyways, I'm really proud of myself and wanted to show somebody the transformation.

When I got there, he began showing me around, and told me I'd won a free month at the gym. I signed a small form for my membership, and asked about the gift card. Of course, he tells me that it's a different drawing for the gift card that I had to sign up for. I said no and left.
About 2 weeks later, I recieve a bill for $1300. I immediately call the company, and they say I signed up for a non-cancelable 3 year contract with the gym. I told them, no. I didn't. So the man I was speaking to began screaming at me, calling me a dickfuck (among other things), and hung up on me.
The next night, I went there to get a copy of the contract. Long story short, I politely asked for the contract and the manager (huge, bodybuilder type) got in my face, threatened me, and told me to get out or he was calling the cops. I immediately left, called the cops, and they accompanied me there while I got a copy of the contract. Here's where it gets interesting.
The man that signed me up had signed me up for 3 years on the contract, AFTER I LEFT THE GYM. I was furious. I called the local news, reported them to the attorney general, and reported them to the Better Business Bureau.
Thankfully, after a few weeks, I got a response from the attorney general saying he'd taken care of it, and had a fax from Premier's office manager saying she'd cancel the contract.

(The first picture is from about 4 years ago, but it was the best comparison picture i could find)


With working out originating in post-breakup depression, it evolved into a love of all things fitness, from jogging, to circuit training, to power-lifting. 
Not only do i look and feel better all the time, i have met amazing people along the way who have helped me, and i them.

It is a great thing to start, and a great world to get into. I don't spend dozens of hours a week in the gym, so don't use that as an excuse, because you will learn to just love it!

(In an average week i only spend about 4 hours in the gym: (1)Chest/tri-(2)back-(3)legs-(4)shoulders/bi)


Thanks /r/fitness for the inspiration, and i hope i can give back.

FAQ'S (taking quotes from previous answers):


YES I'M STILL NATTY (unless you count creatine... &gt;.&gt;)


LIFTS (at around 140lbs):
""Bench 105kg, Squat 150kg and Deadlift 180kg""


WORKOUT:
""I Keep 2 basic  staple exercises for each workout, so i can easily track progress, then after that i just do what i feel like so i can keep it varied and do the whole: ""keep the body guessing"" thing.

Saturday (Shoulders and Biceps) has the two staple exercises of: Shoulder Press (x4 sets) and Lateral raises (X4), then usually do a superset of a random other shoulder exercise with Shrugs (x4). Then I then do any assortment of bicep exercises for 8 sets.

Sunday (legs) has the staple of Squats (x6) and Leg Press (x4) and then do a random leg exercise for 4 or 8 sets, depending if i pick a compound or isolation exercise.

Wednesday (Pecs and Triceps) has the staple of Flat dumbell press (x4) and inclined bench (x4), then i do one other random exercise (x4). I then warm up triceps a bit more with 2 sets of dips, then i do a random 8 sets of triceps, pretty much always ending with rope pulldowns.

Thursday (Back, which most people will want to hear about i guess) has the staple of Deadlifts (x4) and wide pullups (x4). A Note here is i only do 3 rep deadlifts, and i do FULL range pullups. After that i do a random 3 other back exercises (x4 each), but it usually involved close cable-rows and close cable-pulldowns.
After that i train calves 3 times a week, and core twice a week. I now always do core on the days i'm not in the gym so i don't have to be in the gym as long (i try and avoid adding another 20 mins to a workout if possible), and i also do it PRE BREAKFAST. Not eating lets me get a better contraction on my crunches etc...""


REPS:
""With the exception of the first exercises, i go the classic 8-12 reps for most of my exercises, BUT i go 20 reps for my final exercise (for example i could go for 20 rep cable flies after pecs).
If you want to know what i do on the first exercises for my rep ranges: Deadlift: 3 reps Squat: 3 reps Dumbell Press: 6-8 reps Shoulder Press: 6-8 reps""


NUTRITION:
""On an average day, when i'm not traveling our out and about: 100g porridge oats 300g brown rice 3 or 4 portions of meat (e.g. a steak or a chicken breast) 60g whey protein (usually mixed with food, as dont have post workout shakes) 2 portions fruit 2 portions veg."" - Though i dont count the calories, this is just what fills me up and lets me stay lean.


CORE:

""Currently I have two ab routines, both of which i do in a week once:

In both of them I begin with x4 sets of crunches and x4 sets of stiff-leg raises.

Then the first variation after that is x4 sets of a superset of ""situp-plank-situp-plank"".


The second variation (focused on obliques more) consists of x4 sets of a superset of ""side plank-side plank (other side)-normal plank"".""

At this point I HAD NOT YET DONE P90X. Middle picture was when I decided that I needed to do something about my overall leanness. I turned to P90X

The picture on the right is after 3(ish) rounds of p90x and learning how to eat right. Sadly, I haven't always rolled right into the next round of it. I took 51 days off at one point last year. Sometimes I would wait 2 weeks between rounds. I skipped a few days here and there. BUT, the most important part is that I've been fairly consistent with it. ""Do your best, and forget the rest.""

I'm currently doing p90x2...so we'll see how far that takes me.

DISCLAIMER: Remember, 100% of what you see here was done for about $100, in my living room, in under an hour a day. Yes, I'm sure some (many) of you could get better results in a year, and so could I...had I paid a monthly membership and then paid for a personal trainer and had access to better equipment :-).

EDIT: to post numbers and stuff
(SORRY about calling the first picture ""fat"".  I know that there are plenty of people out there that are WAAAY larger than I was.  I wasn't trying to talk down on any of you.  I just felt ""fat""...and it was a large fall from my former active lifestyle.  No disrespect intended)

As for the diet questions....my diet during my weight loss period was VERY good. I used the Calorie Counter app from Fatsecret and tracked everything I put in my mouth.  I was shooting for 700 LESS calories consumed than burned PER DAY.  Of course, I didn't always hit that, but it was a goal.

Sadly...my current diet is shit. I just ate 8 oatmeal cookies for dessert after dinner (chili) tonight.  I also drink about 20oz of soda a day, at least.  I wish I had the dedication that some of you have to stick to a clean diet...but sadly, I do not :-/",,False,,t5_2qhx4,True,,,True,t3_pycd9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/pycd9/1_year_workout_results_p90x/,
1356923279.0,1126,self.Fitness,15pdab,Gym advice for people with new year's resolution to get in better shape,1527,401,580,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/15pdab/gym_advice_for_people_with_new_years_resolution/,"First of all, good for you.  There are some things you should be aware to make everyone's experience at the gym better.  Here's a list of things to keep in mind:

* always re-rack the weights/bars/dumbbells you use
* try not to occupy something you are using in between sets if you do not have to.  This mostly applies to dumbbells and adjustable benches.  Re-rack the dumbbell or don't sit on the bench incase someone else wants to use it.  This does not apply as much for squat racks or fixed benches though (basically anything you use barbells for), but if people are waiting try to finish your exercises quicker if you can.   
* if you are not sure if something is being used, ask.  Sometimes it can be confusing because some people re-rack their weights and some people do not, so it can be unclear if a lone barbell is being using by someone.  Ask the nearest person if they or anyone else is using it.  If someone is using something you want to use, wait or ask to work in with them.  Most people are very friendly in the gym.  
* The squat rack is not to be used for bicep curls.  Please, please, please do not do that.  There are many other spots to do curls in the gym, but much less for squatting.  

That's pretty much it for gym etiquette.  Following these makes everyone's workout a little smoother.  

As for actual exercise advice, here are some very basic tips:

* eat a good snack before, and a good meal after
* get a good warm up, it makes the actual workout a lot better and easier
* perform exercises with correct form, even if that means using light weight.  don't worry about what people might think of you, to be honest, no one really cares about what you look like or what you lift in the gym.  Proper form will make the exercises more effective and greatly reduce the chance of injury
* free weights (dumbbells, barbells, and body weight) are better than machines
* stay away from the smith machine, it creates unnatural movements that are hard on your joints, and is not necessary.
* drink water and breath during your workout
* big/compound lifts like squat, bench, pull ups, and military press are best and most effective, and should be done first in your workout
* get in the habit of squatting and deadlifting. they are not as much fun at first but they are great for you (form is extremely important though).
* most importantly, more important than anything else i've said, is have fun.  Enjoy yourself when you are exercising.  Make it fun and have fun sweating and getting in better shape.  

I suggest reading Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe, its very informative and a good read for anyone.

Feel free to correct me on anything or add anything I may have missed.


Additions from everyone:

* keep a log of everything you do.  write down your workouts and how many sets and reps you do.  also take pictures and measurements of yourself every month to track your progress.

* have reasonable expectations of where you are trying to get.  changing your body takes time and wont happen in a week or a month.  keep exercising and going to the gym and over time you will see change.  getting in shape will happen gradually, but you'll get there.  

* some people pointed out that you should not try to finish your exercise quicker if people are waiting, as i suggested above, as you may injure yourself, which is correct.  do not risk your form or health for anyone else.  if people are waiting and you can shorten your rest periods in between sets, then give it a shot, but otherwise, dont worry, take your time and work out smartly and correctly.

* i feel like i did not emphasize how important it is to have correct form when lifting, especially when squatting and deadlifting.  go on youtube and look up videos, ask people in the gym, read articles in books or online, and post form checks to r/fitness.  lifting properly is so much easier and effective.

* listen to what your body is telling you when you are exercising.  if you need to rest, then rest.  if something doesn't feel right, then stop doing it.    

* find a gym that you like, they are not all the same.  I personally like smaller, local gyms as opposed to big, franchises like powerhouse and planet fitness because they feel more personal and like they are mine, but thats just my preference.  Find the gym that works for you.  ",,False,,t5_2qhx4,1357002218.0,,,True,t3_15pdab,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/15pdab/gym_advice_for_people_with_new_years_resolution/,

I went from the photo on the left to the photo on the right in a span of two years.  It took a whole lifestyle change, blood, sweat, tears and dedication to get to where I am now.  Being called fat by people SUCKED, especially since I grew up thin, was thin in high school and only had gained the weight while in a tumultuous relationship after high school.  I wasn't used to it.  It was terrible.

I posted the below information in a comment on another redditor's post.  He had inquired about what motivators could enable him to keep on working out. I just decided to tell a little story about how I got to where I am now and what kept me going:

My transformation came in stages, and it wasn't easy. I set mini goals and when I was able to reach them I set new ones. I feel like this allows you to stay motivated because the goals are attainable. My first goal was to just lose any sort of weight.  I went to the track after work and would just jog until I couldn't anymore, then walk until my breath got back to a normal state and then I would do it all over again for anywhere between 3-4 miles a day.

I ended up losing 36 lbs this way around the end of the summer of 2011. I was also a vegetarian (although my eating choices still weren't the most informed as I was eating a lot of frozen vegetarian dishes). I started eating meat around October and then I then started to make some really smart food choices and actually researching nutrition.

I joined Crossfit in January of 2011 at 150 lbs and in 2 months I went down to 135 lbs. Crossfit is pretty expensive but I got the knowledge on proper form, lifting and nutrition. I also felt it was really easy for me to go because I had spent the money on a membership, didn't want to waste it and the comradery is so motivating! I now eat about 80/20 Paleo/Non Paleo.

I decided to start lifting at another gym with my boyfriend and that is where I am currently at. So far I have lost another 3 lbs this month.  I can now do three consecutive pullups. I like to flex my muscles in the mirror and I check myself out. I love it when my clothes get smaller but I get STRONGER. I also had a girl e-mail me telling me I was her inspiration and she has lost 30 lbs already. I started crying. I came a fucking LONG WAY from where I used to be and I am still stunned about my entire transformation and even more stunned someone is using my transformation as their motivation.

I'm sorry if there's a specific subreddit for this - if there is please direct me to it and I will post it there instead. I feel like if I put this here, maybe someone will see it and be encouraged to run that extra mile, or maybe a girl will see this, not feel intimidated and start reading Starting Strength.  All it takes is a goal and a desire to be fit! 

**TL;DR - I lost 54 lbs in two years, changed my whole life around and I believe that if you want it - you can obtain it.**

**Edit: Thank you so, so, so much for all of your kind words and inquiries.  It means a lot to me!  In a few months I will post an update!**

Here are some of my favorites (bulking):


**Chicken/ Beef Curry with Rice**


Place diced chicken or beef in a pan on medium heat.

Add chopped peppers, onions and garlic.

Add 1 tin of chopped tomatoes with your favorite curry spices.

Boil until thick.

Take off the heat and add around 1 tablespoon of Greek yoghurt.

Serve with rice.


**Beef Chili**

Place lean mice beef in a pan on medium heat.

Add onions, peppers, mushrooms, chilli's and garlic (or whatever vegetables you prefer).

Once cooked add 1 tin of mixed beans (or any other beans you have available).

Add 1 tin of chopped tomatoes with your favorite chilli powder.

Boil until thick.

Serve with rice or baked sweet potato. You could even toast tortillas for burritos.


**Pasta and Mussels**

Place [Instant Pasta](http://i.imgur.com/38GcykJ) in a pan with boiling water.

Add frozen/ fresh mussels and simmer until ready.


**Chicken Pizza with Sweet Potato Wedges**

Bake chicken breasts wrapped in foil with your favorite marinade or spices.

Cut chicken into small strips.

Buy a crappy pizza from your local store and place chicken strips on top.

You may also add caramelized peppers and onion on top if preferred.

Add low fat cheese if required.

Serve with baked sweet potato wedges.


**Chicken and Tomato Pasta**

Place chicken in a pan on medium heat.

Add peppers, onions and garlic.

Add tomato puree and quickly sweat off.

Once cooked add chopped tomatoes and you're favorite Italian spices.

Boil until thick.

Mix with pasta.


**Chicken Kebab with Sweet Potato Wedges**

Dice chicken. 

Marinade chicken with your favorite spice or sauce and place in a pan.

Add chopped peppers and onions. Lightly toast wholemeal pita bread. Serve with baked sweet potato wedges.


**Tuna Chunks with Baked Sweet Potato**

Bake sweet potatoes (I microwave first then toast them under the grill).

Take some tinned tuna and mix with cottage cheese and lots of pepper.


**Tips;** When caramelizing onions and peppers make a lot and keep a tub in the fridge, they can last around 4-5 days and will save you lots of time when you want to add quick flavours. When I make chicken pasta or chili, I make about 3-4 portions which I sometimes take to work or if I am in a hurry can quickly microwave them.

Do 40 hard minutes, not an hour and half of nonsense.""",1697,586,618,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/odvmo/jason_stathams_take_on_exercise_get_serious_do_40/,"The Men's Health interview is [here](http://www.menshealth.co.uk/living/men/Jason-Statham-exercise-regime) and his mentality has been driving my workouts for years now. It's amazing.

I thought some of you guys might appreciate it.

&gt; He has built his body through brutal intensity and a perpetually changing workout regimen. He focuses on practical skills, not mirror muscles.

&gt; “Musclemen grow on trees,” he says. “They can tense their muscles and look good in a mirror. So what? I’m interested in practical strength that’s going to help me run, jump, twist, punch.”

&gt; True to that, Statham follows a simple rule: if you’re going to train, train hard. And train with a purpose. It all stems from an uncompromising mental approach.

&gt; “I’m a firm believer in attitude,” he says. “Some people just don’t have that desire, and they need a good kick up the arse. Look, you’ve come to train… let’s fucking train! Your body is like a piece of dynamite. You can tap it with a pencil all day, but you’ll never make it explode. You hit it once with a hammer: Bang! Get serious. Do 40 hard minutes, not an hour and half of nonsense. It’s so much more rewarding.”

&gt; When the role calls, Statham learns the advanced applicable skills. Wushu stick fighting, jiu jitsu or knife throwing, say. But the basics of his athleticism are simple body-weight exercises and plyometrics. He keeps his metabolism high and his famed agility up to scratch with fast, hard circuits that require almost no equipment.

&gt; “I’ll jump rope, then do squat thrusts, burpees, [squat thrusts in which you thrust your legs out, back to your chest, then leap in the air], star jumps, push-ups, tuck jumps [jump up, lift your knees to your chest, and straighten to land], and step-ups,” he says. The technique of each is as intense as the circuit itself: “If I’m doing a push-up, I go down slowly and then Bang! push back up as explosively as I can.”

There's more in the link. A little of it is a touch of broscience but you cannot deny that this man knows how to tear it up.

I hope this helps to spur a few of you on at the gym today. 

EDIT: What does this guy do that's so special? 

* Finished 12th in the World Championships Diving in 1992. He was also a member of Britain's National Diving Squad for twelve years.

Zero eating out or alcohol nothing that contains, sugar, fruit or milk or that is made from these things... 2-8 really small meals a day (looks like I'm eating all the time) as it's every 2.5 -3 hrs 90% of food I prepare myself, as I get derailed easily if I let someone else prep my food.

the rest is just about being disciplined and listen to your body. once the body starts shutting down, i reintroduce some normal food for 2-4 weeks and then go through withdrawals when starting the diet again.

I freakin love food and have no switch... if my meals were not packed up in small boxes I could eat my daily amount of food as one meal. Knowing your weaknesses helps you control them better. God bless Tupperware. LOL

""This is one that I only witnessed first hand but still felt vindicated by it.
I work out at a large fitness chain gym and they have a ""bar"" where you can buy drinks and shakes with various supplements. I normally just bring my own, but I had forgotten it this day due to being a little slow out of bed, and decided to give it a shot. I hopped in line behind this self-entitled suburban house mother in her head-to-toe pink name brand workout outfit and patiently waited my turn.

We slowly move up and finally it is her turn to order, but instead of ordering she just starts lecturing the employee (A huge dude) on how dangerous the use of steroids are for him and how his genitals will shrivel up and die and he will grow man tits, and etc... Essentially publicly humiliating an employee for no reason at all.

Now I have been working out at this gym for a few months, and I go at different times according to my schedule... but almost every time I go, he is there either working or working out, and the amount of dedication that he has is admirable. I'm not saying he doesn't use them for sure, but judging by body language and how he suddenly seemed so defeated, I am almost certain he got that way through natural means and hard work.

She finally ends her unsolicited lecture and orders a protein shake with soy milk because she is trying to lose a few last pounds before the summer begins. The employee reluctantly turns and starts to make the shake and she steps to the side to take a presumably very important phone call. That's when I catch it, the sweet sweet petty revenge. Instead of putting protein mix into the shake, he puts in mass gainer.
If you don't know much about fitness supplements, mass gainer is essentially very dense protein and carbohydrates, so it was still a ""protein"" shake, but probably ~400 calories more than what the plain protein shake would have been. Judging by how small this woman was, those extra calories were just enough to burst any caloric deficit that she was trying to get, but not too much to gain much extra weight... If he keeps this up, she will sit comfortably for the remainder of the summer prep time at the exact same weight completely confused as to why her efforts just aren't cutting it.

Just as he turned around to hand it to her he caught my eye and froze. I just gave him a wink, he smiled back and handed her the evil concoction. I was sure to give him a nice tip out of admiration for how expertly he had engineered that petty revenge.

TL;DR: Self-entitled suburban bitch lectures someone about none of her business and gets a big helping of petty revenge.""",,False,,t5_2qhx4,1369202058.0,,,True,t3_1es72p,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1es72p/enjoy_your_gainz_xpost_from_rprettyrevenge/,

",1422,334,178,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/156adh/a_message_to_older_redditers_im_40_and_i_did_it/,"[My before](http://imgur.com/wNKwg)
[My after](http://imgur.com/tcWJm)

Like the title says, I’m 40.  Some background.  I’ve never been an athletic guy, didn’t play sports in high school, and completely uncoordinated.   I was never heavy but I think the proper word to use would be chubby.  I got married, got a great job, had kids, and settled into to a very comfortable life.  Most of my evenings were spent quietly with my family, and weekends were beer and video games.  My weight went from the chubby 5’9” 180 to right over 200.  Pants went from 36” to a tight 40”.  Still, I didn’t pay much attention.  [Until the picture.](http://imgur.com/f4jaw)  My wife sent this very photo to all our friends and relatives for his first birthday announcement, with the title, “My chubby babies.”  Nobody was rude, nobody said “Jesus, Diggsentme, you’ve packed on some weight.”   But I looked terrible, I just couldn’t believe it.  I realized that if I didn’t change soon, I would be a chubby daddy forever.  

So screw it.  I got a membership at the local mega gym.  My regimen was very simple:  three days a week, with a 3 day split.  Mondays I would do chest and back, flat/incline bench, cable rows and lat pull downs.  Wednesday was shoulders and arms, dumbbell presses, barbell curls, and triceip pulldowns.  Friday was legs with squats and deadlifts.  I would aim for 3x5 for the bigger muscle groups and 3x8 for the smaller.  If I could do more reps than last time, I’d increase the weight by as small as possible.  My numbers never were impressive, nor are they now, but I’ll tell you this…I started out curling fifteen pounds, pressing 25s, and benching 95.  After lifting I would run on the treadmill for twenty minutes.  But not ONE of those reps was a gimmie.  And not ONE of those minutes on the treadmill were ‘warmups/jogs/cooldowns.’  (I did do warm-ups/cooldowns, but I never counted them in the twenty.)

I downloaded MyFitness Pal and logged 1500 calories a day.  I did this RELIGIOUSLY.  I made a game out of seeing if I could eat like a caveman (later I found out it was kind Paleo diet-esque).  The simpler the food, the better.  If it had more than five ingredients, I wouldn’t eat it.  On Sundays I’d make a huge pot of something like chicken and quinoa, or beef and broccoli, ham and split pea soup.  Then I’d divide it by 5, put it in Tupperware, and take them for lunch.  Before I went to bed, I’d set up oatmeal in the microwave.  Just come downstairs and hit start, pee, and breakfast is served.  Fridays I’d cheat and eat as much pizza or nachos or anything I wanted, as much I wanted, as drank much beer as I wanted, for an hour…8-9.  I very, very rarely cheated otherwise.  Maybe a piece of cake at a birthday party or a rum and diet with a client.  If I was DYING of hunger, I promised myself I’d eat only after I still wanted food after I chugged a big glass of water and sipped a glass of tea/coffee.  Nine times out of ten I’d be okay.  

Things I learned.  
**FOOD.**  FOOD was the key.  Being able to control myself was by far the hardest thing.  I had to learn stop eating for pleasure or fun, eating just to eat.   I had to be completely aware, all the time, what I was eating.  To do this, I would look at the food, think, count to five, and then eat.   Some things I couldn’t have in the house.  Chips, cookies, beer…I realized I could NOT control myself with them even in the house.  

**Just pick a program and START!**  I researched for maybe a month on programs, literally.  Everything got so confusing, so precise and scientific…There are hundreds and hundreds of options for lifting/running/eating.  I just picked one.  My ‘program’ isn’t magic or perfect, far from it.  In fact, I’m sure it’s lousy.  But I needed a starting point.   

**Max effort, all the time.**  I tried absolutely as hard as I could.  I had it in my mind that if I was to fail, and I sure as hell thought I would, then it wouldn’t be my fault.  I could then honestly say, “I tried as hard as I could, and it didn’t work.  I was too old, my body couldn’t change.""   So every rep was to failure and I was drenched in sweat after my treadmill, panting.  But it was only three hours a week.  

It took me about six months, averaging about eight pounds a month.  Now I weigh a lean 150.  So what changed?  Clothes fit better and I LOOK better.  Feel better, healthier?  I am no longer so strict about my diet, but now I know exactly what 1500 calories look like and am much more conscious about what I put into my body.  But the biggest change, strangely enough…people look at me differently, treat me differently.  It is very hard for me to describe, and I’ve read of other people who have lost weight have experienced this as well.  People take me more seriously, I think?  When I talk to people, they look me in the eye and seem to listen more carefully to what I say than before.  

But more importantly, what DIDN’T change?  I am not some amazing tri-athlete.  No Hollywood muscles.  I can’t dunk or run fast or lift tons or will climb Kilimanjaro.  Running over ten miles is impossibly hard for me.  I don’t have superhuman will.  I have not become a vegetarian or a food Nazi.  Girls don’t randomly give me their number or buy me drinks.  I don’t, and I realized I will never have, Thor’s shoulders.  I’m still me.  I still have the same insecurities, the same fears, the same worries that I have always had.  Getting in shape made me feel more confident, sure, but not to the point where I’m some rugged alpha male getting in bar fights.  I’m not smarter.  I didn’t get a promotion or a new job and I still drive an older Honda.  My friends and family don’t love me any more than they did before.  But I am happier.  

Last words.  I am nothing special.  I am not a superhero.  I am an average, non-athletic 40 year old that got tired of how he looked and worked very hard.  It is not magic or something reserved for twentysomethings.  It was hard, but not impossible.   You can do this too.  I promise you that you can.  A quote by Socrates that I tried to remember when I felt like quitting:  “What a disgrace it is for a man to grow old without ever seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.”

About the picture, I knew my wife was trying to be funny, but it did lead to an argument.  

Food...most times I'd eat differently from my family.  Sometimes completely different, sometimes smaller portions.

The first 70 was pretty easy. Started at 270 and right now floating between 195 and 200. The holidays were rough food wise but I am getting back on track. I've had nagging aches and pains for about a decade that started going away with the first 30.

Edit:
A little misunderstanding on part. I do want to contribute.

At 270, I started just changing my diet. I gave up most of the bread, sweets, and all sodas/ sugary drinks. Just water and coffee. I tried to keep my calories under 1800 and my exercising was only walking 3 times a week for about a mile at a time. 

At 250, I started C25K. I am still struggling at week 7, but I can run 2 miles non-stop. Not fast, but not bad either.  If you want to do it, it's awesome, there is a great app for a smartphone too, but for the love of all you hold dear, get you some good shoes and learn how to run properly so you don't hurt yourself going in. I tried C25K years ago and quit after a few weeks because of shin splints. I bought shoes to cushion my fat ass stomping and learned how to improve my stride and all good.

As far as gym work, I do very little weight training. I do pushups, situps, deadlifts, rows, and squats (never all together). Sometimes I will add a day of arms or legs, but I have very specific fitness goals and I am trying to stick to that program. Weights are only done twice a week, but pushups and situps are done 3 to 5 days a week.

I was sidelined from Nov - Mid-Dec for a minor pec strain/tear and it through everything off and then Thanksgiving and Christmas are rough because I love all that food! 

I honestly think the best thing I did for myself was really upping my water intake. I drink nearly a gallon a day and I can tell when I don't. 

Edit 2:

I am 5'11, 197lbs and 38 years old. I am currently in the best physical shape of my life. I couldn't run a mile when I was 18 and now I can run 2.

Edit 3: A few people asked about me and my wife doing this together.

(I'm about 5'10'') Finally began getting attention from girls and all was well. Until I realized that now, instead of being ""The fat kid"" I was now being labeled ""The skinny wimp guy"" After a few years, I began getting tired of it. Between age 20 and 22 I slowly put on 15 pounds of muscle...but I wasn't really going 100 percent, I was just doing a little here and a little there.

Now, last year I finally meet a girl who's pretty swell. (all my other relationships were turbulent and ended disastrously) I won't go into huge detail, but we have great chemistry in all areas, we never fight, we make each other laugh, more or less we're a bit over a year in and I really hope we spend the rest of our life together.

Now the bad news. About 3 months ago I FINALLY got really serious about my body. I want to be as strong, and fast, as I possibly can. (I do sprints instead of cardio now) I really pay attention to what I eat, use creatine, follow a strict work-out plan and already I'm seeing great results. However, last week my girlfriend was cuddling up to me while we were watching a move and she put her hand on my chest...and made a kind of weird noise. I was like ""that was strange"" The next day she asked me ""Why do you work out so much?"" I told her I want to be the best I can be. She sighed and said ""But you're so nice right now...""  I asked her what the problem was and she said that if i got much bigger she wasn't sure if she'd find me as attractive anymore. 

The thing is...I don't feel like i'm that big. I'm about 170 now (my goal was somewhere around 180-185) I'm torn because this girl is so wonderful, and I know she wants me to be happy. she was just being honest. (she likes really skinny guys)

I have been meaning to post this for a while so results photos are a few months old but still accurate. I started my fitness journey in the summer of 2006 right after an extremely unhealthy freshman year in which I gained the freshman 15 each semester. This was mainly due to taking the all you can eat buffet at my dorm cafeteria as a challenge every night and my discovering of alcohol late into my second semester.  


**2006**  

Early Fall ~215lb http://imgur.com/EgMavlt Late Fall ~210lb http://imgur.com/54oVqkl  
My wake up call came when I came back home that summer and weighed in at 238 lbs which for my 6'1"" height makes a BMI of 31 which is considered obese. Also when getting my blood pressure checked it was 130/90 which is pre-hypertensive. These two revelations along with loving teasing from family and friends gave me the motivation to start an intensive workout plan. The routine I did for the next ~2 months was pretty simple as I did not know much about exercise at that point. I would run to the gym (1 mile away) and do 3 sets on 10 machines doing 5 minutes on the recumbent bike in between each machine then I would run back home. This got me down into the 215-220 lb range by the time I went back for my sophomore year of college. Being home had helped my nutrition as well as having noone to drink with in town but I was concerned about what would happen eating at the cafeteria again so I combated this by only eating breakfast there which consisted of scrambled eggs, sausage, biscuits, and skim milk. For lunch I just had sandwiches with potato chips and for dinner used my meal plan to either go to the campus chick-fil-a or the campus burger place. Definitely not the healthiest food options but made it easier to have a consistent amount of calories per day (though I had no idea of how to count calories at the time). That fall semester I started researching more about exercise and started taking a lot of supplements including a workout multivitamin (contained way more than I needed), a BSN stack of Cellmass, Nitrix, and NO-Xplode, as well as ON's whey protein (paid for by donating plasma 2x a week). I got down to 206 lb during that semester and that is the lowest I would weigh for almost 4 years though I was slowly increasing muscle mass and decreasing fat.  


**2007**  

Stayed in the 210-220 range not much changed. Dealt with some personal issues towards the end of the year and stopped going to classes.
  

**2008**  

Spring ~220 lb http://imgur.com/HOsPYhj  
 
In the spring I changed my major to Kinesiology, took an intro Nutrition class and eventually added Nutrition as my second major in the fall. Learned so much about the body, exercise, and nutrition was able to start making a lot more healthy choices though still partied 1-3 nights a week so didn't see too much of an improvement in weight though continued to get stronger. Stayed closer to 220 in this time.  


**2009**  

http://imgur.com/X5T3a7Y  

Did the P90 program over the summer (predecessor to P90X). Stayed in the 210 range.  
  

**2010**  

2 year relationship ended mid spring and drank/partied a little too much the rest of the semester but got back into things during the summer.  Did insanity for the first time and helped shave off about 5 lbs. Highest weight: 195, Lowest weight 190.   


**2011**  

http://imgur.com/EsRbf8r  

Gave up alcohol for 9 months, then started allowing myself to imbibe once a month or on special occasions. Got a job personal training after graduating Dec 2010 so had access to a fully stocked gym whenever I wanted and the time to do intense 1hr+ strength training sessions. Did P90X workouts at the gym in the fall, substituting insanity workouts on the cardio days. Highest weight: 193, Lowest weight 188.  


**2012**

Did the first month of P90X2 but then switched to the M.A.S.S. program from MuscleMag during the spring. Summer moved to a new town to get ready for grad school in the fall. Started running 3 miles 5x a week, biking ~10-15 miles 3-4x a week and swimming 15-45 min 1-2x a week mostly due to not knowing anybody in town and having nothing else to do. Saw an advertisement for a sprint triathlon and decided to do that at the end of July. Absolutely loved the intensity of it and decided to start working up to a half ironman by the fall 2013. So slowly increased my mileage by 0.25 mi/week on the run and 1 mi/week on the bike the rest of the year. But also eating at a caloric deficit most days. During the fall I was either breaking even Mon, Wed, Fri or a few hundred calories under but Tues, Thurs, Sat I would be 1000-1500 calories under maintenance. I was eating 2500-3000 calories/day but towards the end I was doing 3 5-6 mile runs a week, swimming 1 mile a week, doing strength training 3x/week, and biking 30-40 miles 2-3x a week in addition to the 3 mile rides to and from campus. Did a few months of the Stronglifts program in the fall, then switched to a 2 workout/week, 1 ""push"" workout and 1 ""pull"" workout program towards the end of the year due to my increased load from triathlon training. Nutrition pretty similar to what I'll describe as my current diet in 2013. Highest weight: 193, Lowest weight 183.  


**2013**  

http://imgur.com/KAoQhEa http://imgur.com/9puChUu  

Suffered a partial Achilles tendon rupture at the end of Jan that would set me back all spring. Yes this was probably due to overtraining and undernourishment in the previous semester but I had been eating at maintenance all of January (average 4000 calories/day) so I dunno. The injury was 2 days after my first 60 mile bike ride attempt on my first 7.5 mile run so that was probably more the cause than anything. During the spring did a modified version of Beachbody's Body Beast program at the gym, loved the workouts but videos were kind of obnoxious. Highest weight: 185, Lowest weight 178, 7% body fat.
  
  
Nutrition:  
Goal is to have low sodium ~2000 mg, ~40g fiber, macro split ranges from 50/25/25 to 50/30/20 CHO/Pro/Fat. Calories usually around 2500 but I adjust it daily. Protein around 150-170g. I usually input what I plan to eat the next day into MyFitnessPal to make sure the totals are what I want and can adjust accordingly.  
  
  
Fiber was actually getting too high especially on high calorie days so I've substituted the 100% whole wheat pasta I had almost every day with brown rice or enriched pasta and Honey wheat bread instead of 100% whole wheat on sandwiches.  
  
  
Low Calorie Breakfast:  

* Scrambled eggs with fat free cheese (1 whole, 3 egg whites)  

* Oats w/blueberries and ground flax seed  

* glass of Skim Milk  
  
  
High Calorie Breakfast:  

* Scrambled eggs with fat free cheese (1-2 whole, 3 egg whites)  

* Homemade pancakes with blueberries and dark chocolate chips ~425 calories  

* Honey  

* glass of Skim milk  
  
  
Snacks throughout the day:  

* Banana  

* Almonds  

* Yogurt (mixed with oats if didn't have for breakfast)  

* Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly sandwich (if need extra calories)  

* Whey protein post workout w/creatine  
  
  
Lunch:  

* V8 Low Sodium  

* 1 apple

The main point I wanted to make is to not put so much pressure on yourself to make huge drastic changes in a short period of time. Not everyone can lose 50-100+ lbs in a year nor should you. Just making small healthy changes to your diet and lifestyle will help you slowly lose the weight and when you get to your goal you will find it a lot easier to stay there because you will be accustomed to that level of intake/exercise. If there is anything else you would like to know just ask! 
  
*edit:* Fitocracy profile, feel free to follow me! http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/KingBeer/  

*edit2:* A lot of people have commented/asked about the differences between 2006-2011 and 2011 onward. The main difference besides have a lot more time and less social life is my goal setting skills. If you take one thing away from this post its that one of the best keys to success like I have had is actually setting small realistic measureable goals. So for example I want to lose/gain/lift this much by this time and to get there I want to have done this much by this time and so forth. Not as I was pre-2011 ""I just want to lose weight or be in better shape"", know what you want and find out how to do it. And also that while you should have your mind on the long term, focus mainly on the short term and take it one step at a time. Every pound towards your goal is a battle won in the long war that is your fitness journey. 
  
*edit 3:* Something that I feel really helped me maintain muscle mass while losing weight is my pre and post workout nutrition. For example I would have a meal, then 2 hours later 2 cups of fat free chocolate milk (good because has quick digesting carbs aka sugar and well as protein) then an hour later workout. Immediately after workout have post workout shake with whey protein and quick digesting carbs (I used Smarties candy instead of spending $20+ on post workout carbs that are essentially sugar) or more recently a protein shake that already has the carbs in it. Then an hour after my post workout shake have 2nd or 3rd meal of the day depending on timing. 

*edit 4:* A lot of people have expressed appreciation for the nutrition info I included, here is a diet plan I made for my friend based on his dietary preferences. He is 6', 27 years old and was wanting to bulk up about 0.5 lb/week.

**MY JOURNEY**

**Cookie Cutter days**

I started off my first 8-10 weeks hiring this infamous guy named Omar Ventura, who Layne Norton cites as one of those cookie cutter guys who puts people on starvation diets/canned meal plans. It was true, but I totally credit that experience for a lot of my success. His plan was essentially ""eat 8 oz meat, 8 oz carbs, 6 oz veggies"" x times a day, choose your meat/carbs. 

The vagueness of his meal plans forced me to learn how to cook creatively etc. and helped me to find a good rhythm and establish good habits with my lifts - this was no credit to him, though. 

There was a falling out w/ him and his clients on IG and we peacefully departed because we didn't want to be associated with all of that... ANYWAY.

With that approach, I lost 1-2 lbs a week.

Some highlights of the approach:

* carb cycling three days, 120g, 100g, 75g... ridiculously low
* calories were at around 2400, 2200, 2100 (for a 220lb guy at the time)
* protein was upwards of 350g!!!
* fats were as low was 40g a day -_- ... let's just say I had trouble getting *it* up, probably due to low testosterone
* lift 5x a week, 45 min cardio everyday at 120bpm heart rate
* after 10 weeks, bump cardio up 2x a day on top of lifting...

After the falling out, I knew these things:

* cardio was WAY too much
* protein was WAY too high
* fats WAY too low
* I looked flat most of the time
* based on the knowledge I had, my macros were screwed up, and I felt crummy the whole time

After the ""falling out"", I huddled with some friends who also left that coach. Highly influenced and educated by the guys at Team 3DMJ, we called ourselves ""freeDMJ"" (lol)... and we pretty much tweaked our macros, given the information and experience we knew.

**IIFYM days (possibly forever)**

I slowly switched from that crazy macro ratio I had. For the first week, I determined the macros I had from the previous plan I was on, and started incorporating more lenient foods like ice cream and nuts. Over four weeks I:

* went from PCF: 350g+ / 100g / 50g towards...
* PCF: 190-200g / 250g / 75g (roughly around 2400 - 2600 calories

After making that switch and throwing out carb cycling, I had a much steadier decline in weight, and I **looked** better. Must have been all those fats and carbs I started to incorporate.

As much as I want to trash the cookie cutter plan I was on, it really did help me with sticking with a damn plan. I was religious about clean eating and such. And going from that into flexible dieting made me appreciate the plethora of foods I can eat. 

**Exercise**


My exercise more or less stayed the same; under the cookie cutter plan, all major lifts are in there, with a LOT of accessory lifts; rep ranges were in the 8-15 range. The major change I made were:

* lifted in the 3-6 rep range for major lifts (squats, db presses, OHP, deadlifts, pullups, rows)
* reduced cardio down from the ridiculous 2xday/5 days to THREE. That's right, THREE 30 minute HIIT sessions. I look better, feel better, and I'm not in the gym the whole damn time. It was already a red flag for me when I saw the cardio at 2xday... glad I'm not doing that anymore as it's unnecessary and damaging to your metabolism and gains. In any case, I go on that pump-stepper, warm up at level 3 for 5 minutes, then do 30 seconds on level 12 / 30 seconds level 1 for 15 minutes. Then the remaining 10 minutes, I stroll at level 5. 

Workout split:

* Monday - chest and tris. DB bench, incline bench, dips, cable cross overs, tricep pulldowns
* Tuesday - back. Pullups, deadlifts, stiff arm lat pulldowns, DB rows, DB curls
* Wednesday - legs. Squat, leg press, stiff leg deadlifts, leg curls, leg ext
* Thursday - shoulders. BB OHP, lateral raise machine, rear delt machine, shrugs, etc.
* Friday - back again (more volume, though, and no deadlifts)
* Saturday - gun day. I'll do high volume pump sets to get my shoulders, arms, and traps pumped, play some basketball, and enjoy the weekend. 



**Some tips I have for new IIFYM**

* your habits play a huge part in what you end up becoming
* start off with ""clean eating"" i.e. whole foods to fit your macros for like a week or so... build discipline, and THEN start slowly incorporating calorie dense foods... Your DISCIPLINE NEEDS TO BE ASSIMILATED to this lifestyle first.
* just because a ""carb"" is a ""carb"" under IIFYM, always incorporate whole foods into your food sources. I notice sugary foods make me CRAVE for other sugary things, while brown rice and such fills me up... find what works for you
* I don't do Intermittent Fasting, consciously - but I did find that I skipped breakfast simply because I wasn't hungry. This allowed me to have bigger meals after lunchtime workouts... it worked for me and kept me going.
* I know that I'm ALWAYS hungrier at night. I leave about 30% of my carb intake for bedtime so I can have things like Skinny Cows and Slow Churned ice cream. It gives me something to look forward to, and all those carbs help me sleep for some reason
* identify your ""trigger foods"" and stay the F away from them. I personally have a difficult time stopping when I start eating kettle corn... it's like, I HUNT for those super sweet clusters, and it's just hard to stop

**Some other notes**

* goes without saying, get a food scale and measuring spoons/cups
* leave a meal every week where you just ""eye ball"" the macros -- this isn't a cheat, it's leeway for social moments like family parties. Don't turn a blind eye and binge eat
* use MFP and IIFYM calculator... best tools I've seen so far
* WRITE DOWN YOUR LIFT NUMBERS and try to beat them every week in reps or in weight. It makes lifting so much for fun
* DO YOU, BOO BOO - don't give a shit about what others are doing on social media and such. When you post shit on social media, most people have a tendency to get a nice dopamine release from all the love they receive, and they get completely COMPLACENT!!! Know yourself... Do you, boo boo.

**EDIT:** formatting. PS, I know others look much better than I do at sub 10% bf.. I must have a lean ass or something.

**EDIT 2:**

Thought I'd provide a bit more information:

* I've taken that body fat test a total of four times now; each time I get dunked in multiple times and the numbers are averaged out. I understand I don't look like the typical 8%, so I'm taking those numbers with a grain of salt. But hey, it's the only damn test I have at my disposal, along with calipers (which seem to be within =/-.5 of whatever my dunk test showed).
* No one commented on the graph, but those were four seperate times I took the test. 
* I upped my strength, but I also lowered volume. I believe most of my ""gains"" were neurological.
* I LOST muscle from April until now (3 lbs, according to the tests) along with 7 pounds of fat.
* Goes without saying: I did NOT gain muscle and lose fat simultaneously.
* No dammit I'm not on roidz. Geez. Triceps were there to begin with, just covered up in fat. You could see that in one of the collages (although it's my right tricep, and I think my left tricep looks better). And honestly, if I were using, I wouldn't be afraid to admit it. If that's your kinda thing, do you, boo boo. You're taking a calculated risk for YOUR body. Whatever. Feelskindagoodbeingaccused.jpg
* #1 pet peeve are people claiming natty but not, and thus giving false hope. No I haven't lived long enough to be the villain in that regard.
* Yes, I used to lift super heavy back in college; did sports etc. 
* Under my belt, I have years of bro science, fittit lurking, and watching Eric Helms and Mark Rippetoe vids
* I work a desk job 6-9 hours a day
* Tricep tip: constant tension, deep stretch on presses. I flex the crap out of them. 
* IIFYM: if it fits your macros. MFP: myfitnesspal",,False,,t5_2qhx4,1374084509.0,,,True,t3_1ig405,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1ig405/xpost_from_rprogresspics_male_20_bf_to_8_bf/,

Being a nerdier than average internet population, a lot of us probably have the same story: interested in getting fit, but having basically no athletic experience on which to draw even basics of how to interact at a gym. When it's crowded, how to use / not use a locker room or towel, how to put clamps on bars / when it's necessary, where to do certain exercises, how to interact / not interact with others, etc. Stuff that most people would find beyond basic but that would remove a lot of the unknowns from the process.

Right now there's some good stuff on etiquette, but less of the total first time gym goer stuff.

I realize it would be a lot of hand holding, but based on the frequency of posts to the effect of ""how can I work out with a 10 lb barbell and a door frame"" that we see my guess is a lot of people have the same reluctance I had and might benefit from something like that.

I wasn't active. I wasn't healthy physically or mentally. I decided I wanted to change. So from that time I've been disciplined with my diet and fitness and can say I'm truly happy. I lost a total of 50lbs of unhealthy weight and added nearly 40lbs of muscle. [I just wanted to share this as motivation](http://i.imgur.com/YUSZfz7.jpg?1) for those of you who are also making the change to a healthier life. 

Edit: Thanks everyone for your support. As far as eating habits go, I turned to cooking for myself about 90% of the time. I absolutely love to eat and of course the unhealthy stuff tastes best so I occasionally get Chipotle, BBQ or Mexican food. But usually it's some sort of grain/oats in the morning, a home cooked meal (grilled or pan-seared steak, chicken or fish and vegetables or long grain rice) for lunch and then a meal/protein shake for dinner. 


Some of you suggested I share my workout routine. I generally consider a set 8 reps.

Chest: Cable flys (lower, mid, upper X 3 sets each) and either pushups (till fail) or free weights (lower, mid, upper X 3 sets each)

Shoulders: Overhead barpress 3 sets of 135lb &amp; dumbbell flys 3 sets of 30lb. 

Back: shrugs 3 sets/15-20 reps at 275lb, deadlifts 3 sets/10 reps at 205lb, and wide grip pull-ups (weighted 35lb) 3 sets/5 reps. 

Legs: Leg press 3 sets at 585lb, squats 3 sets at 225lb

Abs: I do declined situps holding weights. 3 sets of 8 w/35lb going straight and 2 sets of 8 on each side w/15lb. 

Arms: bar curls 3 sets of 90lb and hammer curls 3 sets of 45lb. 

I usually work back &amp; arms same day, legs one day, chest one day, and deadlift and shoulders same day. Pace myself to finish in about an hour. 

For cardio I either play basketball, run 2 miles/day or 100yd sprints until fail (whichever I feel like doing that day). I'm finishing up my last semester of college so I have ample time to do all this and prepare my food which helps a lot.

**EDIT**: Hi all! Here is a quick update with more info. First, thanks for all your messages and support!  
To answer the most asked questions:  
* I am 5'11"".  
* I am 23.  
* Like whato1986 mentioned in his [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/x3mm2/in_january_i_decided_to_lose_some_weight_here_is/c5j3ms1), there is no big secret: healthy diet and exercises.  
* Besides running, I did other workouts. First I did weight lifting at my local gym. Then I switched to another form of exercise: [Calisthenics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisthenics).  
* I run about three times a week, around 5k each time.  
* I do my workout routine about 2-3 times a week.  
* I also have an abs workout.  
I will write more after work, with things I eat or do.  
Also, for those who are interested, you'll be happy to know that I am working on a blog about everything I did, because I read and learned a lot since January (and I still am) and so I have a lot to share. I still need a name for it though so I am open to suggestions!  
And thanks for all the comments about my beard :D  

**EDIT 2**: Food  
Here is a typical weekday for me.  
For breakfast I have two hard-boiled eggs with a cereal bar and skim milk. Then for lunch I eat either a soup or a salad (coleslaw, potato salad, chicken salad) at a green market near my work place and an apple for dessert. When I come home after work, I have some fruits (apple, mango, watermelon, melon or pineapple). For dinner, I always have a bowl of salad (leaves, mix or coleslaw) before the actual meal, it helps to eat less after that. Then it could be brown rice, whole grain pasta, couscous, potatoes with turkey, chicken or tuna. I can also make a mix of frozen vegetables. And for dessert, it's a fruit or a water ice with that heat.  
During the weekend, I always make pancakes with my girlfriend. Regular recipe but we use whole wheat flour, skim milk, butter substitute (we use the ""I can't believe it's not butter!"") and sugar substitute. I also love Greek yogurt with some granola. We usually go out on weekends so it depends on where we go.  
Also, I wanted to say that since I started, I always have my guilty pleasure once a week: Chinese food :)  

**EDIT 3**: Exercise  
Like I said, I run try 2-3 times a week for 5k, and it takes me 30 minutes.  
If I don't run, then I'll do my routine. To do so, I use this awesome app: [Gain Fitness](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gain-fitness/id441646808?mt=8). It generates a program to do according to what you want to do (Health, Fat Loss, Muscle), you choose the duration, what you want to focus on (Full Body, Upper Body, Core, Legs) and say what equipment you have. I usually do 60 min of Fat Loss on full body or just core.  
Besides that I occasionally bike for one hour on weekends.  
And also, I walk a lot. Every day after lunch I go for a 30 minute walk, and I walk fast, I do like 2.2 miles in 30 minutes. I live in New York and instead of taking the subway, I walk for another 30 minutes before taking the subway to Brooklyn.

I was an avid athlete in high school and still worked out on a regular basis in college. I didn’t however, take my diet or exercise very seriously. It wasn’t until this weekend when I was shirtless at an event and I got a ton of comments on my body that I realized something changed. It caused me to go back and relook at some photos. 

Two months ago I went through an emotional breakup and it caused me to get a trainer, if for nothing else to distract myself. The result was two months of intense workouts and a strict diet. Nothing too special, lifting 5 days a week. Two days of back/triceps, two days of chest/biceps, and one day of legs - abs each day. As for the diet, heavy protein, low fat/carbs. Roughly 300g protein, 200g complex carbs, 60g fat, 2,400 calories overall.

**Edit**: Added diet and routine.

**Edit 2**: **Common Questions**: 

1. Yes I have a cheat meal every once in a while. Never a full day, but I'll give myself a dinner out or dessert. If I go out on a weekend and drink/eat too much, I'll add some more cardio the next day.

2. I do change my meals sometimes too. It's always a lean meat (chicken, tilapia, turkey), and always dark veggies. I typically grill or bake my chicken with Mrs. Dash seasoning to reduce the sodium.

3. Yes I do abs with each workout. I've also started to bring in additional ab exercises - most recently declined weighted crunches. Decline bench, 25lb plate on my chest, 3x30 reps.

4. I have also started to do some shoulder work on leg days.

5. I did do SS for about 3 months between pic 2 and 3. It was a great way to jump start me, and the above routine got me to where I'm at.

I don't care how busy you think you are, just go.",1700,677,211,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1fxl8r/psa_for_college_guys_and_gals_go_to_the_gym_with/,"Here's a brief list of why I recommend it:

1. It will NEVER be easier to learn. As a college student you have access to (most likely) an excellent facility that you don't think about dropping your monthly pay check on, AND experienced lifters who WANT to go out of their way to teach you. This will not be the case when you graduate, and you might actually consider paying someone to teach you.

2. Someday, even if you don't think so now, you're probably going to want to know how to lift with correct form. You might be willing to hire a trainer to teach you, on top of gym membership. And if you want to learn all the little secrets on lifting heavy, you might have to go to a more serious gym even. Instead, you probably could have learned a ton from your college friends/classmates who lift heavy. For free. Knowledge for life.

3. People move away and get much busier after college. Even if you really stay in touch with your friends who lift heavy, it will be much harder to find time that works for both of your schedules. Trying to talk training advice and correct form via telephone or even video is not as valuable as having someone right there to show you instantly what to correct, whether it's how your elbows should be when lowering the bar or what your knees should be doing in a squat.

I'm posting this because I didn't learn as much from my friends in college as I could have, and I just want to make sure others take advantage of it.

**TL;DR**: Go learn from the experienced lifters in college. It will never be easier than it is right now. No matter if you're fat, skinny, male, female, whatever, someday you're going to want to know.

Edit: just realized I probably shouldn't have put those parentheses in the title but I don't think I can change it. Girls benefit from lifting too, a ton. We have a lot of guys in this sub, but girls should definitely learn to lift too, and the entire lifting community should be inclusive and encouraging of women who want to learn. Or experienced women who want to help teach men too.",,False,,t5_2qhx4,1370710606.0,,,True,t3_1fxl8r,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1fxl8r/psa_for_college_guys_and_gals_go_to_the_gym_with/,

[HELP],1708,696,837,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1ax2uh/youll_never_guess_what_happened_to_me_at_the_gym/,"Hi all, today was my the start of my 3rd week at the gym. Been going 4 times a week and starting to really enjoy it, found a gym buddy who knows his stuff so he gives me pointers. Today however I was there on my own, I am slim and trying to gain weight, my strength is poor at the minute so i'm not exactly lifting too heavy.

I was working on Back and Biceps and was just finishing off my EZ bar curls with 5kg on each side (like I said not lifting heavy because Im a newbie)

and this kid comes in whos about 17/18 (i'm 20) and he gets on the bench and starts pressing 22kg each arm without a warm up or whatever, I didnt really care, I was just in the mind set of ""each to their own"". 

I was just finishing off my last set getting to the 6th or 7th rep where im struggling 4 sets in and I see his camera on his phone flash in the mirror!! I look over and his phones pointing at me and the flash has gone off!?

I was shocked, I couldn't believe it. I went over and pulled his headphones out and asked what he thinks he's doing taking pictures of me while I'm working out. He denied it straight away so I go to the staff there and report him. I left really embarrassed and didnt finish my workout, the staff are talking to him but its really knocked my confidence to know that he more than likely is just gonna post it on his facebook or twitter and make fun!?

It's like it's supposed to be a magic fucking button. No self confidence? Lift some weights. Can't get laid? Pump some iron. General unhappiness? Do your squats. If getting in shape is the answer to all of these problems, then why the fuck do I still have all of them? I look like a fucking male model, I squat 365, bench 275 and deadlift 500 but I'm just as unhappy as I was when I was skinny and weak.

Don't get me wrong, if I hadn't started lifting and found some passion in my life, I probably would have fucking offed myself by now, but it's a fucking *strange* feeling to judge your worth as a human being based exclusively on your powerlifting total. It's also gotten damn near impossible to relate to people. Women are intimidated by my size and build. Men assume I'm an idiot douchebag. 90% of my time is spent lifting, eating to get stronger, reading about lifting methods, programming and periodization and planning my next program or for my next meet. Have few other hobbies and no other passions makes connecting to normal people for anything more than a couple hours damn near impossible - I will inevitably want to talk lifting and they're just uninterested.

I figured I could meet women who share the same passion for lifting that I do, but where the fuck are these women? The gym? If they're anything like me, when they're training they don't want to be interrupted (which is just as well, since I wouldn't want to interrupt my training to talk to people, anyway)

I don't even fucking know why I wrote this out. It's about time for another meal and protein shake.

Edit: Wow, this blew up. I got so many messages that my inbox broke, so I'll edit in responses to common ones here:

Regarding social awkwardness: my problem isn't so much that I'm socially inept (but I can see how that's the assumption from this post), rather that for the vast majority of people my extreme interest in lifting and getting stronger doesn't coincide with their interests in *whatever*. I can make small talk and don't have social anxiety, but after a while most people start to find my obsession boring. Most people see lifting ass a tool to achieve a better body or be healthier, so they can't understand or relate when I want to squat 600lbs for the sake of squatting 600lbs.

Regarding ""pics or GTFO"": Sorry, no. This is a throwaway account because my other account (with pictures) is highly recognizable in the fitness subreddits. 

To people who think I'm unhappy because I lift: Meh. The only real enjoyment in my day comes from moving a barbell. Last thing I want is to do that less.

Reasons for you to support Silverhydra's nomination and eventual election: 

* An excellent mod.  He has been at the forefront of managing the growth from 35K to over 110K front-pagers in the past year.  He has been active both in the threads and behind the scenes in discussion about what we do about the issues new popularity has brought.  

* An excellent community member. In addition to modding, he comments widely and often.  Were he not a mod, he would still be one of, if not the, most widely recognized members on fittit.   He brings an unmatched background -- particularly in supplements and nutrition, but also in weighttraining --  rooted in objective science, explaining things clearly and usefully in what typically become the definitive statement on almost any topic in a thread.   His comments settle the issue. 

* He also runs two strong threads every week -- Tuesday Nutrition Threads, and the Thursday Supplementation thread -- which serve as important foci for these critical aspects of fitness. 

* He does all this with a strong spirit and positivity which raise the mood of the entire subreddit. 

* He has the head of a shark. 

* Simple fact: [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) would not be the fitness subreddit it is were he not here, nor would it be as widely read and as popular.  He was here when I arrived almost 2 years ago, and over that time, I have not seen any single mod -- or user -- who has more positively affected the fitness of so many people.  


Answer to obvious question: no, I did not discuss this endorsement with silverhydra in advance.

Today I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried a zumba class. I wrote the following for a humor website (www.dailybeefing.com), but I figured you all may enjoy it as well.

I work in a large office building that has many amenities, including a gym. This gym offers free classes during the day, including various strength and cardio classes, for the employees of the various offices that rent space in the building. My particular office has disproportionally more young women than men, and they are incredibly mean. For example, for my birthday they banded together to buy me a purple and pink yoga mat and demanded I attend the free lessons. 

I originally intended to write about my experience being the only male in the Friday yogalates class, however, I’ve put that off for months now and I’ve started to actually enjoy it. Sure, I have to hold my farts in for 45 minutes at a time and I still feel like a creep, but my balance and flexibility have greatly improved. Plus, another guy joined the class. 

What I’m going to write about is my first experience at a Zumba class. Somehow drunk me betrayed sober me and agreed to attend a Zumba class with my malicious coworkers. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Zumba, it is a group dance fitness class made up by Colombians solely to embarrass white people. If you look at a map you will see Poland is as far as you can get from South America, so I was about as genetically ill-prepared as you could get. 

I knew I was in trouble 5 minutes before the class began when the super enthusiastic instructor put on a belly dancing belt with all the bells on it. And, of course, I was the only guy in a room with 20 women. 

Once the music started, it seemed simple enough, all I had to do was watch what the instructor was doing and then do the same with my much larger and hairier body. But It was not simple. I could see what she was doing perfectly fine, and then some synapses failed to fire in my brain and instead of repeating her motions I would flail like I was having a seizure. It was incredibly frustrating seeing something, and not being able to do it. After that class I feel like I can sympathize with anyone who is retarded, or left handed, or, god forbid, both. 

Each song last about 5 minutes and consisted of a lot of shaking of body parts that I did not have. By the time I could figure out the sequence of steps, jumps and shakes, the song would end and the whole process would start over. It lasted 50 minutes.  My one moment of glory came about 35 minutes in, when the instructor gave us a choice between a Russian song and a hip hop song. I loudly voted for the Russian song, despite the centuries of animosity between our nations, hoping that our bit of shared blood would give me a chance to shine. And shine I did. I jumped and kicked and cancan-ed like the glorious Slavic beast I am. But there was no redemption, it was 5 minutes of glory amidst 50 minutes of failure. The class ended with a few ballet stretches to a thundering rendition of Swan Lake, which barely drowned out my sobs. 

No amount of scrubbing could wash off the shame I currently feel. If the wife was to leave me for a manlier man, I wouldn’t even try to stop her. I feel like I need to dead lift a house, or fight a bear, or get a motorcycle to feel manly again.

Ralph Waldo Emerson has been quoted saying “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.”  Fuck you Ralph, I’m never trying anything new ever again.

In high school, I was always the ""average"" guy. I always wanted to be better, but I had no ambition or drive to be. I was average at sports and maintained average grades. I had a lot of natural talent, but I never really pushed myself to my true abilities. The only sport I did practice to become above average at was baseball, but I never strength trained or got into really good shape. I was too lazy, I would just practice fundamentals and drills. One thing that always bothered me was that I was always the butt end of jokes. Growing up, I just learned to deal with it and shake it off. I had pretty much no confidence in high school, and I just kind of got by. My weekends were spent playing video games or Photoshopping/making art on the computer. (Which I was too embarrassed to really tell anyone about in high school) I had little concept of a social life.   
  
I told myself when I went to college, I wanted to be a different person. The first semester went okay, I was still pretty much the same person, but I had more of a social life. The next semester I hit the gym every other day, just kind of going through the motions. In about March I saw some progress, and I started researching more. I came to this subreddit, and I read a lot of the programs and kind of built my own off of what I read. Fittit has really helped push me. My routine has changed a lot through the year, but this is what I currently do.  

  
  
Monday - Back/Shoulders  
Tuesday - Run a *hard* mile, core work  
Wednesday - Legs  
Thursday - Another hard mile, jump rope after  
Friday - Chest/Arms  
Saturday - Mile followed by core work  
Sunday - Break  
  
  
I have successfully followed this routine for the past 3 months, and that's when I started seeing my biggest gains.   

  
  
Back/Shoulder day - Military press, wide grip chin ups, deadlifts, bent over rows, face pulls, chainsaws, close grip chin ups  
  
Legs - Squats, lunges, jump squats, power cleans, leg curls

Chest/Arms - Bench, dips, dumbbell bench, flys, pull ups, curls, skull crusher, chair dips

Core - Planks, stomach planks, fifer scissors, In and Outs, and some other exercises I'm not sure the names of.  

  
  
My lift numbers are  
Bench - 245 max  
Squat - 335 max  
Deadlift - 375 max  

I am 6'4"" @ 185 lbs. My diet is pretty much all meat with some fruit. I eat junk food when I am out with friends, or when I am with family.

In the past year my confidence has gone up more then I could have imagined. I look, feel, and act completely different. I stopped caring what others think about me and just focus on myself. My grades have gone up, too. I got my first 4.0 since 7th grade this past semester with the only A+ in my digital art class. I am not trying to advertise, but if you are interested in what I mean by digital art, feel free to check out my portfolio at www.brandonspahn.com. I'm also a lot more focused, and I manage my time to get a lot more things done. I plan on using this following year to continue my new years resolution. The gym has changed my life around.  

  
  
So yeah, thanks for everything Fittit, and thank you guys for reading and I hope I inspired/helped you. :)

I had many requests in my previously very successful post on /r/fitness, about “what was my Abs routine”, and none more specific than one where someone annotated my picture with arrows, asking me how I developed specific parts of my core. The annotated picture is linked below next to two other pictures of my own from the past 6 months, to prove I did not prepare for that picture especially. 

http://i.imgur.com/ddRqahX.jpg


To get a core like this, of course I have a very low body fat, and some specific genetics that give me a 6 pack, rather than a 8 pack. But below is a very detailed description and pictures of my core routine.

I train core twice a week, doing two different exercise variations. 

At the beginning of both variations, I do a superset of ‘crunches’ and ‘leg raises’ (I get about 40-50 reps out of each exercise, though a beginner should not aim for this) for 4 sets. I feel the crunches target the upper abs, whilst the leg raises target the lower ones.

http://i.imgur.com/BkL02VQ.jpg

After these 4 sets, I do one of two differnt supersets (doing the other one the other day I train core). One of these supersets targets the Abs like the precious 4 sets did, whilst the other targets more the obliques and intercostals. 

[Before I explain my two supersets, I was asked a lot about my obliques and intercostals (as demonstrated in the annotated pic that was sent to me). I find the best exercise for both of these is the side plank. A normal side plank is an oblique isolation exercise, but if you rotate the trunk of your body so you are facing the sky more, as is demonstrated in the next picture, it incorporates the intercostals] 

[ http://i.imgur.com/VpWfyoCh.jpg ]


My first superset (for the obliques and intercostals) involves doing a side plank, directly into a side plank on the other side, then into a normal plank (equal counts for them all) - for 4 sets.

http://i.imgur.com/6VpOBOyh.jpg


My second superset involves classic situps, into normal planks, into situps again, finally ending on more planks - for 4 sets.

http://i.imgur.com/ys7kU8gh.jpg

As you can see, this routine is only 8 sets (if you count a superset as a single set). As such, it could take you no less than 20 mins if you rush. See, only 40 mins in an entire week! If my lazy ass can do this, you all can!

[EXTRA] FOR A FUNCTION CORE, NOT ONLY A AESTHETIC ONE YOU NEED TO WORK ON YOUR SPINAL ERECTOR MUSCLES: This is done from such exercises as the deadlift or squat.

2. I'm terrified of getting weaker and having wasted all that time.

I've been lifting for three years. Last week I hurt my tricep/bicep and this week I'm sick. I went to the gym to try to get in some deadlifts and couldn't even lift my 85% set once. Now I spent the rest of the day in bed thinking about working out all day. It seems whenever I miss a work out, I get insanely depressed that I wasted 2-3 weeks to get to a certain point and now I have to restart those weeks just to get to where I should have been because of a missed session.  I feel as if I'm addicted and if I don't get my fix I go into a withdrawal state... Does anyone else get like this and how do you get past it? It just kills my week and makes me a really grumpy person...

Workout Routine: I started doing 5x5 3 times a week with a powerlifting friend 3 years back. Squats/DLs/Bench. After a while I started doing my own thing but I mix it up a lot. Some circuit training, strength training, dumbbells/machines/cables, yoga :P

DIET: http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1k04jl/m_21transformation_100_lbs_to_160_lbs/cbjzpt0
I've been working out for about 5 years but hardcore gaining and knowing my shit for 3.
I've tried to not over-think everything and just listen to my body. If something doesn't feel right figure out how to make it feel better (i.e. a sore shoulder.) If I'm noticing a fault in my gains just mix it up! My biggest motivation was my best friend passing away who loved superheroes to death (I did too, just not as much) and I want to be like those idols of his. I want to start cosplaying too just because it seems fun to be one of the fit guys doing it.

Edit2: That food answer was no good; I eat a peanut butter sandwich almost everyday. Eggs/oatmeal/banana(or blueberries) for breakfast, chicken pasta with olive oil, about 2 shakes a day and another high protein meal or two (red meats with potatoes, tuna with avocado, brown rice and chicken.) Cottage cheese is also something I like before bed and I always carry around a jug of water... especially at work.

* [meat slop](http://www.silverhydra.com/2011/10/meat-slop/) Thank silverhydra. Simple to cook, good for the budget, lots of protein and fiber, good by itself (if cutting), or with rice (while bulking.) Definitely take his advice of re-heating with an egg now and then

* Greek yogurt. I usually buy trader joe's plain, non-fat. 120 cals, 24g of protein per serving. Blends great with protein powder, fruit, milk, etc. A great way to hit your protein numbers. For instance, just blending 2 cups of the stuff with 2 ON 100% Choc Whey protein scoops will net you 96g of protein at 500 calories. For people asking, ""How the hell do you hit your protein requirements when they're so high?"" - there's one good answer. 

I personally really like shakes consisting of protein powder (many flavors work), TJ's organic frozen berries, milk, and greek yogurt. 

* Chocolate Milk. One of the best post-workout foods, and, cmon - it's chocolate milk. It's awesome. Google for 'alan aragon chocolate milk' for a detailed write up.

* Psyllium Husk. Good source of fiber, really makes things, umm, move nicely. Can be useful if you're on some sort of protein heavy, restricted diet that doesn't keep things flowing on its own. Supposedly has some heart health benefits, though I haven't done that research myself. YMMV. You can either just mix it with water/juice and deal with quickly downing it, or mix it into a shake or similar.

* Salsa. What a great food. Tomatoes, peppers, onions, a bit of spice. Goes great on eggs, or with chips, if the carbs fit into your goals. I also think it can spice up veggies nicely. *edit* I specifically mean good, fresh Salsa here. Think more what you'd find at Wholefoods (or a small Taqueria/Mexican store if you happen to live near one), and less the jar of salsa you'd find next to the Frito Lays in the chip aisle.

* Hot sauce and mustard. Two great condiments with pretty much zero cals. Skip the mayo and ranch, go for these guys.

* Almonds are an awesome food. But respect the portion size. I could probably eat a bag of salted almonds without blinking, if I didn't know better. If you've never done it, either measure 1 serving (28-30g I think), or count it out. I believe it's between 23 and 30 almonds. Again, scale is best. This will make you realize how small an actual serving of almonds should be, which comes in around 160-170 cals. This will keep you honest when you snack on them in the future.

* Avocados. A true superfood. I'd link to something written by Silverhydra, but can't find anything authoritative to link to. Again though, a bit calorie dense, so be careful if you're cutting. Probably a food to keep in your diet for life though.

* Remember your macros, and cheat now and then. Do you love an In N Out double double, or Twix, or Chipotle, Oreos, or similar? Eat them...now and then. If you have a calorie goal, realize your nutrition is going to be sub-optimal that day, and you may have to skimp on your other meals. But, overall, I feel it'll help keep your sanity to eat these things now and then. Just don't eat some random amount. Know what you're eating, i.e., how much you're costing yourself in other, healthier cals for the day, and deal.

*edit: adding*

* Buy a food scale. The $50 you spend on an Oxo or similar kitchen scale will pay off in dividends over the years.

That's it. Again, I know a lot of you will have read this and be like ""yeah tell me something I don't know"", but hopefully a few newbies will come across it and see something they missed previously. Cheers.

One year ago I was 35 pounds heavier, could barely walk up a flight of stairs, and the only run I did was to the fridge. I ate everything that I wanted and was miserable.

Now I am only miserable when I don't workout. I've run a 5k, my blood pressure is remarkably good, I've completed the Manitou Incline, and I really watch what I eat.

I continue to set goals, (drop 15 more pounds) and keep pushing my self to get stronger, harder, and faster.

So to all of you sitting on your ass wishing you could change your life, make diet and fitness a priority. If I can do it, so can you. Stop making excuses, there is no magic pill, and it may take longer than you want. But keep persevering and you will make progress.

http://ceefitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_2004.jpg

No pics uploaded of me currently at 196+, if people are interested I may get a couple up later today.

I take in around 1800 calories in the spring/summer and 3000+ calories in the fall/winter while keeping protein intake above 150 grams a day. Carbs and fats play themselves out after I get my protein in, but I do make a conscience effort to keep carbs somewhat as high as possible to keep energy levels up. I have no idea what my body fat is in any of the pictures.

Workout is basically a 4 day split, followed by an off day then repeat. Core/ab work is done every other day at the end of my workout.  
day 1 - chest/tris  
2 - back/bis  
3 - legs  
4 - shoulders  

Hit me with your best about what needs most work... looking forward to cutting down to around 175-180 this spring/summer after hitting 200+ this winter. This stuff gets addicting once you realize nothing happens overnight and you just casually plan for the future and keep pictures to look back on.   



**Edit:**
I'm 5'11"". My lift numbers are average at best; 225x5 for flat bench, 320x1 (pause at bottom) on squat, unfortunately I haven't done deads in awhile... form is terrible on that exercise and I really pride myself on keeping range of motion and form tight so I'll get back to that sooner or later.


**chest/tris**  
flat bb bench 5x5 (alternate with incline every other week, also 5x5)  
flat dumbbell 4x8 (alternate with incline also, 4x8)  
decline skullcrushers 4x10  
dumbbell flys 3x10  
tricep kickbacks 4x10  
reverse grip pulldowns 3x15  
dips (leaning forward) 3x15  


**back/bis**   
weighted wide-grip pullups 5x5  
bent over rows, grip out 5x5  
ez bar curls 3x10  
lat pulldown 4x10  
hammer curls 4x10  
seated rows 4x10  
cable curls 3x15  
dumbbell shrugs 4x15  


**legs**  
squats - My legs happen to just be genetically bigger than any other body part without putting in much work, so tend to work on strength instead of size/hypertrophy. I try and do a progressive weight towards a max so its usually a warmup set of 10, stretch, a couple sets of 5, then couple sets of 2, then I'll start repping sets of 1 until I max out.  
calf raises 4x10  
leg extension 4x10  
leg curls 4x10  
smith machine calf raises standing on a box, calfs facing outward 3x15  
straight-legged deadlifts 4x10  


**shoulders**  
smith machine overhead press 4x8 (switched from babbell after tweaking something in my lower neck a few months ago)  
dumbbell press 4x8  
rear delt raises 3x10  
side raises 4x10  
facepulls 4x10  


no particular foods that I aim for, strictly calories in vs calories out. sometimes I'll eat once or twice a day, sometimes 6, just whatever is most convenient.  

**Edit 2:**
Pic of legs as asked, just snapped 2 mins ago. Sitting at 197 as of yesterday.  
http://ceefitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/leg.jpg

**Edit 3:**
Somehow I went full retard and forgot my ab routine. I alternate back and forth between abs and obliques/intercostals at the end of my usual workout. (Day 1-abs, Day 2-obliques, etc)  

**For abs:**  
4x10 weight decline sit-ups. (weight directly behind your head, not holding in front or across your chest)
2x15 weighted straight leg raises. (place dumbbell between your feet and control the weight through entire range of motion while keeping legs locked at the knees. You can bend the knees and bring the weight straight up as if you was tucking your core in, but IMO I don't find it as good a exercise as keeping legs straight.)  

**For obliques/intercostals:**  
4x10 standing weighted side-bends (tough to explain the actual motion I do for this exercise online, basically google a few videos and play around with this to get a feel for it. I throw in a ""twist"" at the last second is probably the best way to describe it.)
2x15 weighted side-bends on back machine (basically the same movement, except your body is at a side angle and makes a bit tougher on the obliques. same movement without the twist.)  


""abs are made in the kitchen"" is pretty accurate, but you got to build them up in the gym as well. doing 300 sit-ups a night is a waste of time, treat them like any other muscle and throw some weighted resistance in there and focus on the contraction.

During the time I have been using fittit, on this account and my old one, I have seen some good advice given to those asking for it. I have also seen some unhelpful, untrue, and downright dangerous advice given by users who clearly don't know what they are talking about. 

Some of these include telling concerned newbies that their chest shape is because of a pulled muscle, and that it will 
""heal back"" into shape. That achieving a 3"" increase in bicep size in 3 months on a caloric deficit is realistic, and form checks that were bound to cause injury. 

I therefore implore newbies to take the advice given to you in this subreddit with a grain of salt. If the advice given is accompanied by a legitimate source or article (preferably peer reviewed) or a video showing you the correct form, then odds are it is correct information and will help. Bear in mind you have no idea who is sitting behind the screen on the other side of the conversation, and whether or not they are qualified to be giving you any advice or assessment. Don't risk not reaching your goals because of the shitty advice given by someone as gym gospel. ALWAYS ask for a source!

To those out there who would give advice, give a source or a video with it. It isn't fair to someone asking for advice to tell them something you know isn't true or haven't researched yourself.

For any wondering, I have a University degree in exercise physiology and a cert III and IV in fitness (personal training), but from about a month ago I have always attempted to give a source with my advice so you don't have to take my word for it. I simply ask that others do the same. 


EDIT: Downvote if you want, but don't be disappointed when you don't reach your fitness goals, or get injured, following the advice of someone on an internet forum. I'm just trying to introduce a bit of professionalism and credibility to the advice giving culture here. We are all here to help improve each others fitness, so let's start acting like it.

EDIT 2: Happy this managed to get a bit of notice. After reading a few posts about people concerned with the availability of peer reviewed articles, I totally agree that their application to training programs are limited. With so many brands competing for your $, a lot of programs will make unsubstantiated claims. I am referring more to diet and nutrition as well as the basic principles of strength, power, speed, endurance and hypertrophy specific training. 

If you really would like some good basic info on these I'd recommend these textbooks that are currently required for exercise physiology by my former University.

I started my fitness journey last June. I was 27% bodyfat, and hadn't been to the gym (if you could even call dicking around on the elliptical, ""going to the gym"") in 10 years. I read the FAQ here in /r/Fitness (The whole thing, twice. Shocking, I know.) and got started on the StrongLifts program. In 2 months, I went from 27% bodyfat to 25% bodyfat, was 120 lb. and I looked like this:

[August 4, 2011](http://i.imgur.com/ffsjg.jpg)

**NEWLY ADDED BY REQUEST [Today, June 12, 2012](http://i.imgur.com/uuQHT.jpg)**

My lifts at that point were: 

* Squat 100 lb

* Deadlift 145 lb

* Bench 55 lb

* OHP 40 lb

Saturday, 1 year to the week that I started lifting, I competed in my first bodybuilding competition, and fucking *killed* it. 

[Pic from Saturday, my first competition](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Zp7rLGEBmKc/T9Z_yQtgYvI/AAAAAAAAAQc/N6L9HLU-Ado/s1600/top5.png)

I am oompa loompa number 140. I finished second in my Open Bikini F class of 15 gorgeous competitors (""Open"" means all ages from 18+, ""Bikini"" refers to the hourglass shape and softer musculature judges are looking for, and ""F"" means 5'7""+). 

My lifts today are:

* Squat 175 lb

* Deadlift 200 lb

* Bench 95 lb

* OHP 62.5 lb (&lt;-- not a made up number)

I am now qualified to compete at the national level in the NPC (National Physique Committee) and also plan to train in the off season for a powerlifting meet, possibly in December of this year if I can improve my horrendous bench some more.

What I eat: 

* I ate animal products (meat, eggs) for one meal a month as a ""cheat"", but otherwise had a vegan diet for most of the year.

* During the last 6 weeks of prep for the competition, I added egg whites and fish into my regular diet

* I do not eat dairy, I am allergic (sinus/breathing screwiness)

* I eat about 2400 kcal with 200-240 g of protein per day, carbs and fat filled in the rest pretty equally. 

* I tried leangains at first, before I was eating enough, but cannot stuff 2400 calories into myself in my feeding window. 6 meals spaced every 2.5 hours works better for me.

* A couple weeks before the comp, I really ratcheted down the calories, keeping protein high and lowering carbs and fats.

* Right before the comp, I did the crazy stuff bodybuilders do to get lean for a show.

You can see my workouts/follow me on [Fitocracy here](http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/super_luminal/), but to sum up, I did SL for a good long while, with a couple month break due to a non-lifting related nerve injury in my arm. In March, I decided to pursue competing in Bikini division, hired a trainer, and switched to a more traditional bodybuilding type upper/lower body split in order to better prepare my physique for competition. As the comp drew near, I added in cardio (stairmill, steep incline treadmill walking, a billion bodyweight walking lunges).

Also, before everyone wigs out about the competition bronzer, it's there to allow the judges to see our physiques best and on equal footing, it easily washes off and [voila! I'm back to normal](http://i.imgur.com/DXAMK.jpg) (taken this morning).

This means I used to suffer from two annoying problems nearly every workout session. Equipment being in use when I want to use it, and not having a buddy to spot me for max attempts. My workouts would drag on about 30 minutes longer then necessary while I waited for equipment to free up, and my gains stalled since I didn't feel safe to push the limits without a spotter. 

I would get frustrated about this and get all pissy and brooding until one day I pretty much snapped and resolved that from that day forward I would have absolutely no fear about asking anyone if I could work in with them or if they could assist with a spot.

Let me tell you, it has been one of the most amazing choices I've ever made. Now when equipment is in use, I always walk right up to the person (male or female, jacked or small, don't care) and ask right away how many sets they have left (in a polite manner of course). If they say two or more, I always ask if they would mind if I can work in with them. Nearly every time they say yes (I've only been turned down once out of maybe 30 ask attempts). I thank them, introduce myself, do my work outs, help assist with the plate loading, and pretty much make a new friend right then and there.

Same thing with spotting. If I have a max attempt or think I need a spot, I go right up to the nearest capable looking dude and ask if they can help me with a spot. Never been turned down on this. 

It sounds scary but it's really not and the rewards are amazing. Since I've been doing this, I've made like 6 or 7 new friends and people have started to recognize me as one of the top dudes at the gym. It's really been quite awesome. I can't recommend it enough, especially if you are frustrated with long equipment wait times or just looking to make some new friends. Nearly every experience I've had has been positive. 

EDIT: Since everybody focused in on ""alpha"" and ""top dude"" terms like a tractor beam, I'll clarify. The words were meant to be lighthearted. I'm mostly saying that if you can get to the point where you are comfortable talking to anybody in the gym, there is a lot of rewards that come with that. It's incredibly awesome to find the person who's been in the squat rack for 30 minutes and ask if he would be ok if you worked in with him. You both have something in common. He/she might be able to teach you something. He/she could be a really cool person. Or they might not want that, in which case, that's cool too. But it's empowering to get the point, where you're not bothered by such an interaction and can actually enjoy it. After all, it's just a 30 second conversation with a stranger that's potentially a really solid person.

My friend suggested I do something more intense, and gave me his disks for P90X. I did that for a few months, and got bored with it. I started cycling hardcore, and ended up doing a 500 mile ride in July, and that ride was called RAGBRAI. It was pretty fun. I've been doing the Paleo diet on top of all this for the past 3 months, and have been shedding lots of fat. I take creatine and protein daily, and eat lots of lean chicken breast and veggies, along with a multi-vitamin.

Edit : Seriously guys... I love this subreddit. Every single comment has been nice, reassuring and just down right awesome. I'm also glad that I could be an inspiration to others, because I know how hard it is to stick with the task of losing weight. I've been getting tons of questions as to how I can eat so little, and if I get hunger pains. What I usually do is drink a ton of water, and have my meals incorporate lots of lean protein and fat. By reducing carbs and starch and increasing the protein and fat, your body will digest it longer and will keep you full. I usually keep it at around 1500, and I don't get hungry. But, everyone's different so maybe it's easier for me, but hard as hell for you. Even if it's hard, you can do it. Thanks again Fittit! &lt;3&lt;3

It's not much unlike the advice guys ask for around here all the time (""How to I get my abs swole??""). 

Anybody who is interested in fitness is welcome here.  They are welcome to discuss fitness -- their own, and offering advice to others.  What is not welcome are discussions or comments which have the effect of marginalizing or embarrassing members of the /r/fitness community -- in particular, when doing so speaks to an entire class of people, like women, telling them that they will be subjected to mockery and jeers if they post their serious fitness questions here. 

A few members of the now 85,000-strong community thought that a thread on a woman's fitness-related issue was a good time to run that high-larious ""TITS OR GTFO"" message that went over so well for them on 4chan back in 1993.   That they tried to be more creative, unique and sometimes subtle with this joke does not change the joke itself, or the subject of the joke, or the fact that an important group on /r/fitness finds their fitness concerns subjected to mockery. 

Whenever I see someone on /r/fitness acting like that, I offer them a simple message: 

**This sort of behavior is not welcome on /r/fitness.**

That -- plus major downvoting -- usually, they get the message, and we don't see that kind of behavior from them anymore.   

Of course, /r/fitness grows by about 1500 new members a week.  So this message must be constantly and consistently delivered, to reach new members who may not know that this kind of behavior is not welcome here, before they themselves engage in it. 

I'm glad to report that, recently, I've not run into a ""TITS OR GTFO"" or ""FUCK OFF, FAGGOT"" message which had not already been downvoted. 

But what I want to stress:  you don't have to be me -- menuitem -- to add that message.   Any member on /r/fitness can add that message.  That means, when you see someone behaving in a way which marginalizes another member the community, **go ahead and tell them:  This sort of behavior is not welcome on /r/fitness.**

And, continue downvoting those comments to hell.  It's not enough that they should be in negative territory: they should have more downvotes than the thread they're in have upvotes.  **Let the commenter know: this kind of behavior is not welcome on /r/fitness.**

Thanks for reading this though.**




I haven't been to the gym in a while now due to procrastination and depression, but I decided to man up and head off at 10pm at night to let loose some stress.


I got in and there wasn't many people around, except for a group of little swag kids being little shits and not knowing what they were doing (i.e. throwing weights around, re-racking in the wrong places, switching between muscle groups randomly, not completing sets etc.), just a general nuisance to the other members. I ignored them and pressed on to start my routine (Bent over rows).


Well one of the swag kids looks at me and my stance, and starts laughing at how much of a *man of questionable sexuality*  I looked like bent over. His mates joined in and had a laugh. I ignored, and kept going. They started mocking me, laughing at the fact I was only using a 15kg barbell for it (I'm not a big guy). I kept ignoring but I was getting pretty riled up.


One of the kids says to his mates ""yo I bet I can wreck this guy in pull ups he's so tiny"". Bear in mind I'm about 6'1 and 70kg and not big by any means (skinnyfat if anything) and this guy was at most 5'10"" and the arms of a starved stick insect. That set me off.


I moved off from the rows and over to the bar for neutral grip pull ups, fuming on the inside. I put my iPod in on shuffle and the first song that came up was [this one.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYiOFEDmIBU) I was pissed off and pumped to show these kids up. I grabbed the handles and started.


A couple of people had started watching me do this, as well as the swaggies. I hadn't properly done pull ups in a while but I was angry as all hell. I hit five easy, ten, fifteen.... I went to twenty. I was furious and sore but I pressed on. Twenty five, I was really sweating and gritting teeth. One of the onlooking guys (who was ripped to all hell) in front of me smirked and nodded at me in what I think was saying ""Do it man. Finish it.""


I completed thirty seven pull ups in a single set after not going to the gym for approximately three months. I don't know if that's a big thing or not compared to /r/fitness standards but I was extremely proud of myself considering my old personal best was fourteen. I hopped down, muscles seized up and sore as all hell. But I felt good. 


I wish I could say I turned to him, looked him in the eye and said ""Your move, bro"". But I didn't. I just looked at him, picked up my towel and went to the toilets to silently cry from the pain my arms were in.


I came out about three minutes later, the swag kids had moved to the cycling area and seemed to be a little quiet now. Apparently, according to the guy who was ripped to all hell, the little shit had attempted to do the same thing and only made six and a half pull ups. That was a nice touch.


I'm paying for it now, I can barely move my arms and chest but I'm damn happy with that effort. Just thought I'd share my little story with you guys. Felt pretty good.

Current weight 175
Current height 5'7

I am currently using the Nike Romaleos weightlifting shoe,

Rehband knee sleeves,

and Titan Toro Bravo Lever Belt.

http://www.titansupport.com/products/powerlifting-belts/texas-powerlifting-belts/toro-bravo/toro-bravo-belt.html

Currently I am doing legs twice a week.  One heavy day and the other is a speed day.  The speed/dynamic day is really what helped me reach 500 pounds.   It allows me to focus on correct from while also hitting those fast twitch muscle fibers.  

My program is one that I designed for myself. It is an accumulation of different programs that I have tried over 
the years.  I use the parts of the programs that I like, while leaving out the portions I feel do not benefit me. If I had to compare my program to any other program, I would say it most resembles the Westside barbell style of training. 

-----------

Answers to some of the questions you all have been asking.  Sorry in advance for the spelling and grammatical mistakes. 

I compete in power lifting. I’ve done a few meets and have won a few.  I stop competing and have focused on training. One day I want to be the strongest lifter in the U.S. and I don’t see the point in wining local meets anymore.  The only thing that matters is a national win.  I have been training for about 6 years and obtained a degree in exercise science.  I recommend reading a lot on exercise(not muscle and fitness) and try a bunch of different programs.  Find what works for you.  I don’t really care about my appearance. I am not over weight.  I just did my body fat percentage and is about 8%.  Vanity doesn’t mean a whole to me.  I would rather be small and strong than big and weak.  That is my opinion and that’s not a shot at body builders.  You guys train for something completely different and I respect that.  I started using knee sleeves once my knees started hurting (I don’t know if from powerlifting or any other sports injury). They don’t help with strength but make my knees stay warm.  Yes I have trained in chuck and vibrams.  I currently deadlift in my vibrams.  The squat shoes helps with my depth. I can’t really tell you all how long it will take to hit the 500 pound mark. A little advice sometimes less is more, never let anyone tell you can’t lift that much and no matter how many times you fail keep trying.

So there was a point in my life about 6 months ago where I felt myself ballooning up to an uncomfortable size. Mind you, I'm 5'5'' and was never what most people would consider ""fat"" but my cheeks were the size of oranges and all of my pants were getting to the point where I was shopping and feeling HORRIBLE about myself. I worked in a restaurant and ate like crap. Here's the best face shot I could find. I avoided my photo being taken for obvious reasons. http://i.imgur.com/O160h.jpg and a kind of horrible and not well depicting body shot. again, usually avoided the camera.
http://i.imgur.com/URhIA.jpg. I weighed in at my heaviest at 150 solid. 

So I got to it. Cutting a mostly carbs and hitting the gym at least 3 times a week. I started off PATHETIC. I couldn't squat my own body weight more than 12 reps. Never dead lifted in my life, and I thought cardio was my only hope. 
Cardio DID help drop the first 10 pounds, but after that I got insanely bored and I was sick of cutting out so many of my favorite foods. I started eating chicken and veggies, eggs, whole wheat bread and pastas here and there. I love healthy eating now. I'm addicted. 

6 months later, I've lost 30 lbs. And now I can squat 125, DL 105 at max, and bench 80. I hit the gym still 3-4 times a week working on my back, triceps, everything I can. Call me a gym rat. And here's the progress. Made it in time for the summer and bought a bikini in a size SMALL. WOOT!

I sucked pretty bad but I liked it, even ran a half marathon after 6 months. I read a lot, but mostly about running and how great it is for losing weight. I kept doing more Kms a week and faster; smoking the guys at the track that smirked when they saw the jogging fatty just months before felt pretty good, I must confess.

I thought that if I kept eating at a deficit (you know, calories are the name of the game) and trained hard I would end up with a fit body. So I finally hit what I thought was impossible: [168lbs...](http://i.imgur.com/F8HvF.jpg) But I looked just skinny; devoid of muscle and still had a belly. After all the hard work I felt a little cheated. I put in the work, I backed off cake, where’s my six-pack!? At around this point my running partner got injured and along with a bit of back pain and the rather unexpected results I lost some motivation and started doing less and less Kms. 

I realized I’d bounced back to nearly 200lbs so I start running seriously again, at least to keep the fat off, right? I got a lot faster, but didn’t watch my diet so I stayed at around 190lbs. That’s when I discovered /r/fitness and since I was getting [decent times](http://i.imgur.com/ooXU5LA.png) I asked how I could complement and strength training was suggested. So I started doing StrongLifts, after reading the book.

To shorten the story at least a bit, I got much faster, but instead of seeing my lifting days as an obstacle for my running days, it started to feel the other way around, to the point I dropped running altogether (except 3K a day running to the gym and back). At first I couldn’t understand why cardio seemed to be shunned a bit by the community, but coming from it I can see why so many do not favor it. If you enjoy it, great! Just be aware that if you only run at best you’ll end up looking ordinary.

So I became a lifter. When SL was too much I moved to Madcow and recently I started 5/3/1.
“Unfortunately” I fell completely in love with strength training and did not fret  over my diet beyond getting enough protein (Read: cake and assorted sweets were consumed in considerable amounts), so my appearance is still pretty underwhelming [(Comparison shots, all morning cold shots, as you can infer by the wild hair)](http://imgur.com/a/453O6). It has been 11 months since I started and my stats have changed as follows:

Squat: 95lbs - 320lbs (Smith Machine half squats vs sub-parallel barbell squats.)
Bench: 135lbs - 260lbs
Deadlift: 185lbs - 420lbs
OHP: 45lbs - 160lbs

I plan to stick with 5/3/1 and focusing on strength for 5 more months, to then start caring more about cutting and perhaps switching to PHAT. 

Things I think I did right:

* Find a program and stick to it. Do not do random stuff or the program the gym “trainer” pulled out of his butt.

* Previous point doesn’t mean SS, SL or whatever is your new religion; read articles and watch videos from other trainers. I found great cues and tips for my lifts that helped my particular situations immensely.

* Focus on strength for a while. I know this sounds like circlejerking, but even though the “get a strength base and then move on to hypertrophy” argument makes sense to me, the biggest value of lifting for strength for the first 4 months is having a clear measure of progress while you build a long-lasting habit. Years before I had tried lifting and quit each time because measuring my success by looks is extremely frustrating. I questioned myself more than once and all I had to do was look at my log and compare to where I was 4 weeks earlier.
* If you do SL/SS, add dips and chin/pull-ups to your routine as accessories for happy arms and easier press/bench.
* On deadlifts, only use mixed grip when you can't use overhand, and only use straps when you cannot use mixed. This gave me a pretty decent grip (I can do 300lbs overhand and only use straps for shrugging)
* Be a calculated coward. Don't fear getting under the bar, but if you feel something **hurts** or bothers you in a way you know something isn't right, call it a day and come back for next session. I have had zero injuries so far, except a couple of very, very mild sprains I spotted at once and stopped the training session, allowing me to be perfectly fine for the next one. I know that If I had been stubborn it could have been much worse. On the other hand, I pulled 405 for the first time with a fever and almost fainted, which may or may not have been very wise.
* Following on the previous point, remember this is not a 12 week, a 6-month or even a one-year endeavor, but a lifetime pursuit you're just getting yourself into. A single training session is not important in the greater scheme of things, so if you have to cut it short, failed a set or your boss needs you to put in extra hours and you miss the gym completely, it's not the end of the world, as long as you pay your dues every other day.
* This community is awesome, use it! Post form checks, the guys here helped my squat immensely. I was doing half squats and thinking I was doing it right. Make sure you read around, too.

* **Edit:** One point I missed: The bros will quite likely harass you a bit, maybe they mean well, but you *will* get criticism for ""holding the bar too low on your back"" or ""destroying your knees squatting so low"". Keep an open mind, listen to them but find reputable sources to corroborate whatever advice you get that isn't in line with your program. Some are harsher and may mock you for using only the bar or paltry weights. Forego your ego and be patient. You will show them (and more importantly, yourself) in due time. 

Things I didn’t do or did wrong:

* Cardio is cool, but be clear in how it fits your goals. It probably won’t take you where you think it will.

* Calorie control is key for weight loss, but macros are vital if you want to add muscle.

* If you care for aesthetics (we all do) and aren't particularly gifted in that department, do calf raises (I didn't).

* Don't neglect your core! You'll get a good workout from the main lifts, but I've found it has somewhat been a weak spot at heavier weights.

* Supplement from the start if you aren’t getting enough from your diet, but keep it simple. I started drinking protein shakes, fish oil, vitamins and creatine fairly recently, and it has really boosted my performance.

So in closing, I'd like to say thanks to everyone who posts and helps here, you've been enormously helpful and I appreciate it. 

*TL;DR* Was fat, started running and turned skinnyfat, started lifting and am a happy camper now.

It's a beautiful area that takes you along the coastal mountain ranges, through blossoming meadows, and along carved granite cliffs.  

One friend in particular decided to bring along his dog, a Husky who's a bundle of energy (typing that phrase out made me feel 40 years older, but let's move on).  Anyway, he does great for the first few days, runs around, enjoys being a dog, etc.

Now, anyone who's ever backpacked on a longer hike knows that your pack tends to be fairly heavy (anywhere from 20-50 lbs.).   Fully loaded, my pack weighed in at 43 lbs., which is on the heavy side, but I was taking an extra load off the less experienced hikers in our group. 

So, our last day rolls around and it's hot.  Just shy of 90 degrees to be exact, with zero wind.  Of course this particular day just happens to be the hardest, we have to climb back out of the valley we camped in, with an entire day of uphill switchbacks.  By midday, it's clear that the heat is getting to the Husky.  That thick fur wasn't made for any kind of heat, and he starts stopping at every shady spot and collapsing.  Unfortunately we're also running low on water because our last water access was in the valley.

We continue hiking, giving the dog (and everyone else) breaks to cool down and recover before the next uphill stretch.  Myself and the dog's owner are doing pretty good, I've hiked for years and actually enjoy uphill days.  The dog doesn't.  In the hottest part of the day, he gives up.  He lay down in the shade and sat there panting, unresponsive.  I gave him the rest of my water, but nothing changed.  It was kind of a collective 'oh shit' moment.  After some discussion, I said I'd try and hike him out.  I didn't know whether or not I'd be able to - I had no water left but the hike had been fairly easy for me so far and I wanted to try.  The dog's owner (ex-military) had tried it earlier in the day, but didn't make it more than a few hundred yards.

So we threw him up on my shoulders, I took a deep breath and started moving.  It was uncomfortable, hot (his body was wrapped around my neck, with my hands holding his legs like a hog-tied calf), and he was a heavy little fucker, but I did it.  I hiked the dog back to the car, roughly 5 miles away, entirely uphill.  The best part?  I finished a good 10 minutes before everyone else in the party, stuck the dog in the air conditioned car, then jogged back to the rest of the group without my pack to finish the hike with them.

The look on their faces when I came jogging back to check up on them was priceless.

I know 315 isn't really a lot, but 9 months before I couldn't deadlift 95 lbs.  I was 180 lbs and 15% bf.

I didn't have a job, I was barely making any money as a freelance, and I wasn't doing well in school.

My life has since gotten a lot better.  I'm down to about 7-8% bf at 173 lbs (100% clean, no whey, no creatine, no hgh), I saw a therapist for 8 months, and I've gotten a job as a editor of digital publications for a couple of magazines.  I still don't have a girlfriend, or friends really (because I work a second job), and working out is the only thing still keeping me alive. Though, I have developed bursitis in my hip, so I can't do my favorite lifts for a couple months (squats, deads, cleans).

I'm 23 y/o, 6 ft 2 inches


Skinny Picture I was around 155
After picture I weighed in at 184.  


Food wise:
Being the kid who could stay skinny no matter what I ate I took to the food route.  Eat as much High Protein stuff as I can (try to be clean stuff). Lean chicken and turkey can be your best friend.  I make a salsa chicken in the crock pot all the time.  Pretty cheap and easy. 
* 2lbs of chicken
* 10oz can of creme of chicken soup
* 16oz jar/can of salsa
Mix the two cans together pour over the chicken and cook on low for 6ish hours.  Shred the chicken and put back into crockpot, add 2 spoonfuls of sour cream to the mix and eat.  Its great over rice, by itself or with totilla chips.


The only Supplement I added was a protein shake after I worked out. None of that fancy super fancy stuff just some cheap stuff from [GNC](http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3267268&amp;cp=3593187.2108294), only $50 for a 5lb container with around 71 servings (one scoop) I usually took two scoops/


Basic routine breakdown.
**Monday**
Chest exercises 
**Tuesday**
Back and Shoulders
**Wednesday**
Legs
**Thursday**
Random stuff I felt like working more on that week.
**Friday Saturday Sunday**
These were usually rest days, but sometimes I would go in and do some stuff still, and sometimes start the week over early depending on how I felt.


I can't really tell you exercises I did cause it changed a lot along with the big stuff that everyone knows for each muscle group.  When you get bored of what you're doing look up videos online of the muscle group your going to work out next and do those exercises you don't always do.


Find a friend to help you when you get started.  I got lucky and had a buddy who was a football player for a small college who was will to work out with the weak kid and got me started.  It also gives you a great reason to keep going if you have someone that will make you go.


The biggest thing it takes is persistence, keep working even when you think you're not getting anywhere.

In the summer of 2010 my boyfriend (Jimmy) and I (Shane) decided that we had to stop messing around and get fit. What has ensued is quite the transformation in our bodies and improvement in our health. Before decided to get fit, all I really did that would count as physical activity was hiking (which I did most weekends), although my eating was completely unchecked. My boyfriend didn't really do any physical activity and also just ate whatever.

**I started out in July 2010 at 197 lbs at 6'2""**

Start - Shane 1: http://i.imgur.com/rgheK.jpg

Couple 1: http://i.imgur.com/4QU3K.jpg

Couple 2: http://i.imgur.com/ZtiwN.jpg

**Food:**

Starting in July we began to watch what we ate: using light versions of foods we enjoyed, diet pop, and eliminating excess junk food. Weight loss began for us both slowly, then really started to pick up once we began using MyFitnessPal to track calories. We had a budget and recorded everything that we ate and stuck to our calorie budgets. We didn't really change what we ate too much, just how much. Portion control would be my advice for the key to weight loss, at least at first.

More recently, we have begun to focus more on high protein, high fat foots with low carbohydrates. We eat a lot of cheese, cottage cheese, greek yogurt, lean chicken, fish, turkey, and occasional beef. We take protein shakes in the morning for breakfast.

**Physical Activity:**

In August 2010 I began weight lifting 3x per week (MWF) on a split routine with a friend of mine and doing cardio 2-3 times per on the off days about 4 months after that (January 2011). I progressed from elliptical to running and can do 6-7 miles easily now. Jimmy didn't do any cardio until January 2011 of this year, and now does weight lifting and cardio on a similar schedule to mine.

**The Results (So Far):**

Over the past year Jimmy has lost an average of 1.5 lbs/week. My weight loss has been more about body recomposition. I went from a size 36 to a 31 while losing only 10 lbs or so on the scale.

**Here is where I sit now, at 186 lbs:**

So that's where we stand today. Jimmy and I have been focusing more on weight lifting, trying to put on more muscle mass. His dramatic weight loss has resulted in a lot of excess skin, so filling that out with muscle (while continuing to lose fat) is the goal right now.

Ugh...Anyways, back to the regular scheduled programming.  

I'll be the first one to admit that the form is FAR from perfect, but I do think it would pass in a meet.  If anyone has any insight for that, I would love to hear it; not sure if I ""got under"" the bar too much for it to count.  

[Video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI-zG3DLY0w)

Red plate is 45, blue is 35, the black ones are small 45s, and then the 10 and 5.

22 years old, 5'9 about 178, training seriously for almost 4 years, but I lifted on and off (messing around with football and the like) for a bit before that.  My approach to training has always been gain strength on the main barbell lifts and do volume work on assistance exercises (mostly 5 sets of 10).  I've ran a fair number of programs from 5/3/1, to some Westside-like splits, to Texas Method, to Madcows intermediate and advanced, and I tried Sheiko once a while back.  Now, I make my own splits according to what I believe I need.  I'm studying to become a strength and conditioning specialist, so this stuff is pretty much what I spend my time thinking about.  My favorite split would have to be legs/push/pull, repeating that as much as I can, but taking a rest day when needed.  

As for my other lifts, I have a [475 squat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ4SeezwDEE) and my best bench is a touch and go 350 at 170.  Sadly, I haven't benched or done any sort of pushing for months due to a shoulder injury I'm currently rehabing.  

My diet is pretty much whatever.  I have a hard time gaining weight because I get full VERY quickly, but I did manage to get to 200 at my heaviest.  Currently, I utilize a lot of liquid calories through shakes where I'll put in 2 cups of milk, some protein powder, canola oil, a banana, a half cup of oats, and some strawberries.  I'll put in some chocolate syrup as well from time to time.  While I was bulking to 200 I was counting calories, but I don't do that anymore.  I now have a pretty good idea of what I need to do to lose or gain weight without tracking it.

I plan on doing my first meet on November 5th.  Up until then, lifting has just been a hobby of mine that I really enjoy doing.  

That's all I can think of adding.  I'm more than happy to answer any other questions.  ",,False,,t5_2qhx4,False,,,True,t3_1k1qr3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1k1qr3/hit_a_lifetime_goal_of_a_600_pound_deadlift/,

September 12 2011 (birthday :)): 175lbs

The best part is that I did it in a way that I can be proud. People are sometimes shocked that I didn't take any pills or starve myself or something. I honestly just started pushing it in the gym and eating for health instead of eating for pleasure.

Fitness is now my life. I still take pleasure in going out and eating with friends and I don't mind skipping a day or two at the gym but I can honestly say working out is my greatest passion to date.

The Tl;dr is that I lifted in university, slacked off when I got a job and a kid, gained ~25 pounds or more of fat.  Saw a picture of myself and got my shit together.

[Here is the image from that post.](http://i.imgur.com/IfGor.png)

Note that I now have more accurate scales and think the numbers in that post are 2-5lbs higher than I actually weighed.

[Here is what I looked like after my winter bulk.](http://i.imgur.com/T8vMl.jpg)  Here I am 168.  Actually a little heavier than I intended.  A DXA I took a couple days before this puts me at 15.5% BF.

[Here is what I look like now at 161.](http://i.imgur.com/yR2PXMw.png) [Another](http://i.imgur.com/xPXSCTJ.jpg?2). I was planning to cut a bit more, but I started to lose strength on my squat so I have started leangains with the goal of maintaining/increasing strength while cutting.  We will see how it works out.  I know the appearance difference isn't huge, but I have gained strength and I think a reasonable amount of muscle for an intermediate level lifter in 5 months.  I welcome critique or anything you read here.

In the last 5 months between my last post:

* I bulked for ~3 months using IIFYM with ~2800 calories per day, making sure to get 165+ grams of protein per day.  I generally get about 1/2 that from shakes because food is a bit pricey here.
* During my bulk I used greyskull LP with some minor modifications.  I am very consistent and I only missed 3-5 workouts in the last 5 months.  Even when I missed a workout I did as much BW work at home as I could.
* I track calories very carefully and use a scale.  I've only said ""fuck it"" and not tracked for ~10 days over the last 5 months.  Even then I didn't go completely nuts.  I did eat more chocolate than I should have over Christmas though.
* I then cut using IIFYM, about 2000-2200 calories.  I tracked my weight daily and adjusted calories accordingly.
* My lifts are now: Bench 205x6; OHP 115x6; Squat 275x6; Dead 355x6.

My plan now is to continue the LG recomp until I am about 10% BF, then switch to a pure hypertrophy routine and bulk.  I was going to switch to Lyle's Generic Bulking Routine, but I changed my mind because I want to get to the 1000 club and I'm iffy about dropping the weights while cutting.

I hope I this shows others that even with a busy schedule - working full time, being a dad, and having a small business - that there is ALWAYS time for fitness.  I only spend about 4-5 hours in the gym per week, and it makes my life immeasurably better.",,False,,t5_2qhx4,False,,,True,t3_1c21tv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1c21tv/updated_progress_chubby_dadmode_to_relatively/,

Let me share with you how awesome this place is.

* Mark Rippetoe helped design it
* There are *two* deadlifting platforms (5 squat racks in total), each with one of those [deadlifting helper things](http://www.titansupport.com/magento/media/catalog/product/cache/1//500x567/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/d/e/deadlift_helper.jpg). They also have bumper plates specifically for dropping.
* When I asked about personal training, he (the owner) said *I didn't need it*, and if I ever want help with my form to grab him or one of the other employee and they'd spot me. 
* I took him up on his offer and asked if he could spot my deadlift since I was new to this exercise, and he spent a solid 20 minutes with me correcting my form. He also encouraged me to drop my weights on the ground!
* The owner recommended a great way to check my form; bring in my cell phone and take a video (!). Every gym I've been to seems to get really sketched out whenever someone uses a cell phone, and definitely doesn't want you recording.
* There's a dedicated chalk bowl filled with chalk
* Other cool shit like rings and chains
* There's very little machines, but the ones they have are custom made (for example a leg press that pushes completely horizontally instead of the standard weird upward angle other leg presses have)
* It's CHEAP. $50/month, 24 hours, and it's literally month to month. They don't even take your financial information, you just pay when you want to come and don't when you want a month off.
* My orientation consisted of learning proper form for squats, deadlift, bench press and overhead press. This hour session alone would've cost at least $100 with a personal trainer. Whenever I've joined a new gym their ""orientations"" have been isolating my weak points and exploiting them to make me feel like I need a trainer.

Before joining I never even knew a place like this existed. It's like if [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) had collaborated and made a gym. It's beautiful.

Just wanted to share. There might be a gym like this in your city (I'm in Toronto), I was searching for weeks for a new gym since I didn't want to join another Goodlife and the gym in my condo doesn't have a squat rack. This one came up in Google just as I was considering joining a crossfit gym. Dodged that one!

Edit: Not that it's a huge deal, but I'm female. I think this is the most I've ever been called ""bro"" and ""man"" before :)

[3 month progress before/after],1161,323,520,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/w19px/ive_always_been_very_skinny_in_april_i_decided/," I've always been a fairly athletic but very skinny guy. I'm tall, 6'5/195 cm, and just blamed my height as the reason to why I looked so thin. Like many young guys I never really cared about what I ate - I would go without breakfast for days, just eating chips or whatever I would find in the fridge. Also drinking and smoking every friday + saturday certainly didn't help.

 However after finding /r/fitness this april I figured enough is enough. I really wanted to celebrate my 21st birthday with a party by the lake but I hesitated because of my bad physique. But with the material and information from this subreddit and my newly found motivation I managed to go from **185 lbs/85 kg** to **213 lbs/97 kg** in 90 days. 

I used the program *Westside for skinny bastards* - working out 3 times a week with two upper body days and one lower body day -   which I highly recommend for people with similar physique as I had. I'm finally happy with my body and I had a blast yesterday and got tons of compliments!! More than that, I have a new, healthier lifestyle that I'm very satisfied with. Now if I would just stop going out drinking almost every weekend..

[before/after](http://imgur.com/RrPuw) *Sorry about the bad quality on the before picture.*


**What I eat on a normal day**

*Breakfast:*

* One boiled egg
* 2 dl of oatmeal with milk and applesauce
* Whole-grain sandwich with lots of ham
* Protein shake with whole milk

*10 am snack:* 

* a banana, cottage cheese or some other fruit.

*lunch:*

* Typically chicken or beef with lots of salad, bread and milk to drink.

*mid-day snack:*

* Cottage cheese with honey, peanut butter, spinach, beans, goat cheese and a protein shake.

*dinner*

* Same as lunch, high fat high protein based food. Chicken, beef, salmon.

*late night snack*

* Two sandwiches, banana, cottage cheese. Large glass of whole milk.

I haven't really shared my progress publicly before but I really wanted to throw my hat in the ring, as seeing the progress others have enjoyed on Fittit has motivated me to make tweaks and changes to my own life (for what is hopefully the better!). Even if one other person takes something positive away from knowing its possible for a lazy 6'5"" tubster to feel comfortable in his own skin, this community will continue to provide value. 

**The vitals!:**

* Height: 6'5""
* Weight (before): 275lb/125kg
* Weight (after): 213lb/98kg

**Lifts**:

My routine focuses on upper body (when you're a 6'5"" fatty and a mountain biker, legs seem to take care of themselves!). Monday is chest consisting of DB Bench (4 x 10 - max out at 88lb/40kg because my gym feels 40kg DBs are sufficient), Cable Crossovers (4 x 10 - max out at 58lb) and incline DB bench (4 x 10, 79lb/36kg max). I'll typically throw in some weighted dips (88lb/40kg in plates on a chain around the waist) to fatigue the tris, much shaking ensues!)

Wednesday is back with  4 x 10 pull ups, 4 x 10 lat pull down and seated row, all machines

Fri is shoulders and arms with OHP (4 x 10, 1 x 5- 165lb/75kg 5RM), arnold press and DB front raises, EZ curls, chins and weighted dips again. 

Cardio was a simple 5k run on Tue, Thurs and Sat/Sun. 

**Diet**:

Diet has been a tough one. As a tall guy with a consideralbe amount of heft, I fell into the trap of thinking that I needed to eat a lot more than my shorter brethren. The realisation occurred to me that if I wanted to look like someone 40lb lighter, I would need to eat like someone 40lb lighter. When food changes from an emotionally indulgent crutch to fuel, everything else will fall into place. For me, tracking calories on MFP has been a huge help if for no other reason than helping me realise that a) my prior estimates of food were way,way off and b) I am one of those people who tracks and graphs everything and having hard numbers helped me have something tangible to stick to. I found it easiest if I took my required ~230g and spread them across the day beforehand and then more or less IIFYM'd the rest to fall under the 1800-1900 mark, the weight started to fall off at a pace I was happy with. Cottage cheese, Coke Zero, tuna and shaved ham have all served as great 'plugs' for the hunger and IF has worked really well with my lifestyle. 

Any questions, criticisms (constructive or otherwise) or feedback, shoot!

Edit: I should add, props to Dodge84 for the motivation. His IF cut post about 6 months ago gave me more motivation to keep up the consistency than I'm sure he expected.

I am 6' 1"" I am eating around 1500 calories a day. This includes around 120-130g of Protein. I am doing a wide range of exercises with just a set of dumbbells 3-4 times a week (usually Mon. Wed.

Edit 2: Wow! I can't believe how many people have responded to this post! I'm flattered by all your compliments and moved by your encouragement!

I've been getting a lot of questions about my daily routine so here goes:

On a typical day, I will consume a cup of dark coffee, 2-4 hardboiled egg whites, an apple,  a half-cup of surimi (fake crab meat), a 4-ounce chicken breast, a half a cup of brown rice, 2/3 cup of mixed vegetables (frozen), 2 scoops of Body Fortress Whey protein mix, a cup of whole or 2% milk, and many glasses of water. I'll usually eat a small turkey sandwich on whole grain bread or drink some more milk if I need to add some calories. Salads with tuna I reserve for workout days, as for my height and weight I allow myself 3 cans per week to steer clear of mercury poisoning. I'll also snack on peanuts or almonds if I need a quick fix. I take a generic multivitamin as well as 3 capsules of fish oil (total of 1000mg) a day.

As for the workout, my days are usually Mon. Wed. and Fri. I'll start with some jumping jacks to get the blood flowing, then go straight into lifting. 4 sets of push-ups, 4 sets of pull-ups (neutral grip), 4 sets of curls, 3 sets of shrugs, 3 sets of flys or benches, 3 sets of rows, 3 sets of sit-ups, 3 sets of squats, and If I still have some energy, do some more push-ups. BTW almost all the lifting I do is with 30-40 pounds of weight.

I can't tell you how happy I am to see the responses from you all. Please keep doing what you are doing, and ask all the questions you need to help better yourself!

I see them put on 115 pounds and one kid prepares to do a set. From the beginning it is all wrong...the kid has his neck lined up with the bar when racked, his grip is way too wide, etc..

As I continue to warm up, the kid un-racks the bar and starts to perform his set. THANK GOD HE WAS USING CLIPS. The kid obviously had not done this before and the bar started to fall to one side. This whole time I am thinking to myself ""okay spotter, now is the time to grab the bar so he doesn't drop it on himself""...but no, the bar falls to one side and is now sitting on top of the kid. Spotter eventually helps him re-rack the bar.

I wasn't going to say anything because I'm really not that guy at the gym that has to say something to everyone (Lord knows I want to), but what I heard next forced me to do so. As I approach the bench next to them I hear the spotter saying ""you fucking retard, you don't know how to bench"" yada yada yada. I turn to the spotter and I say ""No, this one is on you. If you were doing your job, that never would have happened. How about next time you help him learn instead of calling him a retard"".

So for years I've pretty much kinda fucked around and didn't eat properly. In high school I weighted about 210LB lost some weight down to 155LB then went back up to 185LB which I stayed until about last year. Unfortunately I don't have a photo from last year but in the first pic you can see a picture from 2009. I pretty much looked the same from then until June of last year. 

I'm pretty happy with the results but I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing and see how it plays out. Going to try and get a bit leaner and maybe make some more gains slowly.


In the first pic I believe I weighted about 185-190LBs. Right now I weight 155LB. I'm 27 and 5' 8""

First picture, progression:
Two more for fun: 

EDIT:Routine and Diet

TLDR; Modified SS, caloric deficit.

Well I started off with doing the same crappy routine I was doing for years with just a modification to my diet. I think most people find it too overwhelming to do too much at once so I'd pick one small thing and do it. Then when I started seeing progress I'd make more changes instead of doing everything at once.


I started with a caloric deficit without counting, I just ate less than what I was eating before. I figured if I ate less and moved more I'd get less fat. I also increased my protein intake. It wasn't until I was getting more results that I started to monitor more closely what I ate.


I'm mainly doing SS type lifts with some additions. I injured my shoulder in December so didn't lift for two months.


This is what I'm doing right now. A note though. Until about a few weeks ago I was only lifting ONCE a week, right now I lift twice


I lift Monday and Thursdays and do the following:

Note: I was doing 3x6 for everything for a while but instead of upping the weight I decided to up the reps for hyperatrophy. I'm not really doing that much weight at all.


Bench press 165LB 3x10 (I used to do 215LB 3x6 but it was hurting my shoulder)

Squats 185LB 3x5 (I'm a cyclist so I'm actually trying not to get too huge of legs, not sure if it'd affect speed),
 Deadlifts 275LB 5x1, 

Bent over dumbell rows 45LB 3x10, 

Dumbell Shrugs 50LB 3x10 

Curls 30LB 3x8, 

Pull ups 8-10 depends, 

Face pulls, tricep pull downs



I also do 30minutes of cardio on a bike or spin bike once a week.

As for diet, I drink a lot of whey protein to get lean protein. 3 servings a day. Then I eat mostly meat, veggies and white rice. I eat a deficit on all days except lifting days. I don't eat ""clean"" I eat shit like Mcdonalds 1-2 times a week. I don't think eating clean matters. Just count your calories and macros and eat whatever you want.

1325174209.0,800,self.Fitness,nuzzk,How to Welcome the thousands of new people who are going to come to /r/fitness in the next few weeks. ,1127,327,194,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/nuzzk/how_to_welcome_the_thousands_of_new_people_who/,"If you've been reading [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) for more than a year, then you already know that one of our busiest times is New Years.  It's when resolutions kick in, and a lot of people new to fitness come here to help get a good start.  

We love new community members here!  So many of our old community members came here with almost no knowledge of fitness, learned from this community, and got fit.  

So if this is your first year -- and for about half of the 107K of you, it is your first year -- of New Year's resolutioners, here's a bit of background to help you welcome them.  

* If you're patrolling the new queue, it's important that you read each submission carefully.  While, at first glance, it may appear that the submission is merely ""typical"" (""I'm a 19 year old male, 5'8"" 155lbs, and I'd like to get stronger"") they may include a snippet of important information which distinguishes them (""and I have no endocrine system"") and which needs an individualized response. 

* Most of the new users are going to come here, see the ""Read the FAQ"" note at the top of the page, or on the submission page, and then *actually go read it* (which takes about 45 minutes in total).  We may not notice such new users until they ask a good question (because they read the FAQ) and even then, they may not be noticeable. They are the great silent majority of our users.   

* Some of the new users will not read the FAQ, and then post a question which is in the FAQ already.  In those cases, I strongly recommend you use the copypasta in the FAQ to tell them to read it: 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi! Welcome to Fittit! You're going to love it here.

We saw you coming and have collected answers to your question **[right here](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness)**.


Welcome!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's welcoming and friendly and lets new people know that [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) is a place where they can get information about improving their fitness.   I've counted: about 25% of the time, the above response gets a genuinely grateful response from the OP.  You might think it'd be read as ""brushing them off"", but in fact, usually, they just were oblivious to the FAQ.  Also: you can get special bonus points if you change the link to  the actual section of the FAQ where the OPs question is directly answered.   Being welcoming and friendly lets new people know they are welcome here with their fitness questions, and it helps create new [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) members who then turn around and help more.  

Also, even -- **especially** -- if you don't know as much about fitness as others here, if you know the OP's question is answered in the FAQ, your answering this way above saves the time and effort someone more knowledgeable would have to spend answering the question, or referring to the FAQ themselves.  It's classic division of labor.  Thus, **even if you don't feel knowledgeable about fitness, if you know the question is answered in the FAQ, you're doing everyone here a big favor if you post the above copypasta.**

More importantly: I recommend you use the copypasta because *we need you fresh for the actually hard questions.*   You see, if you type out responses to questions answered in the FAQ, it's time and effort spent which you *could* be using to type out a response which *isn't* answered in the FAQ.  

You only have so much time and energy.  And, if you're in the new stream, about the 400th time you type out an answer to ""I'm a 19 year old male of average health, how I can I get fit?""  you get antsy, and upset.  Don't these people learn? Don't they see the other posts and know they should read the FAQ?  It becomes easy to look past the point that all these new people are completely new, they've never seen [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) before, and they don't benefit from its past. So you might find yourself getting angry with them, and it's tempting to write something snippy or sarcastic.  **Don't**.  When you reach the point that you are feeling snippy and sarcastic to the new kids, it's time to step aside, stop reading the new queue, and let others pick up the slack.  

Finally, it's worth pointing out that there will be a small fraction of new users who will *not* be happy with the reference to the FAQ with their question. These are people who are less interested in the actual information, and mostly want human interaction -- someone to talk with them.  You are more than welcome to have a constructive conversation with them about how to improve their fitness, even though the same information you're providing is already in the FAQ.   But they're likely to start by snapping at you for telling them to read the FAQ ""when I've already read it and question's not in there"" (it is); or by saying ""I wanted to talk to someone, not read some wall of text.""  Such posters can be exhausting.  Don't feel like you have to answer all their questions -- in fact, you can ignore them and just move on if you like.  It's unreasonable for new people to believe they deserve individualized fitness and diet coaching, particularly when their fitness needs are identical to the vast majority of people who come here.  This is often referred to as the ""snowflake problem""; so many who come here think their problems are unique, like snowflakes, when in fact, they're identical to the vast majority of our users, and so the solution is identical.  

**TL; DR**

* Read each submission in the new queue carefully. 
* Refer new users who ask questions answered in the FAQ directly to the FAQ. Use the provided welcoming copypasta.   
* Don't answer questions if you feel frustrated by the repeated questions of new people.  Move away from the new queue, and let others get the slack. 
* Beware of the 'snowflakes': users who think they are unique -- and so deserve unique, individual service -- but are not.  



With that, let the New Year begin!

Since there are often posts on here about eating healthy on the cheap and easy, I'd thought I'd share this since I was making a batch today.

This recipe is completely customizable and pretty simple to do.  The whole process took about an hour, so it doesn't take a long time either.

* 18 eggs
* 1 package of low sodium bacon. (I've used turkey sausage as well, but it tends to make things soggy).
* 15 oz can of low sodium black beans.
* medium bag of cheese
* 10 pk of the biggest tortillas I can find.
* 1 jar mild salsa
* Sriacha (is not figured into the cost of burrito because everyone should already have some)

Step by step recipe in with pictures.

Macros: I cannot stress enough that these are approximate b/c I didn't make sure every burrito had the same exact measurement of ingredients.  If you wanna weigh all the stuff out then distribute evenly, have at it.  But I'm not that bored or dedicated.  so again... APPROXIMATE MACROS:

Cals :493/ Fat: 21.8g/ Sodium: 969.5mg/ Carbs: 46.75g/ Protein: 27.65g

(the 3rd number is sodium because some people care about that, and this has a lot of it)

Since I used bacon, regular cheese (as opposed to low-fat) and flour tortillas, these numbers could be better.  But for the amount of food and flavor... I'll take it.

Also, you can use egg whites, or half egg whites but I do not recommend it because it makes the last half of the burrito a swamp of egg white juice... trust me.  and on this note, I've found that low-carb and wheat burritos are too stiff and tear prone for this activity.

I fucking love these things.

Edit: fixed album settings
Edit 2: I just finished the first one.  It was one that busted while rolling so the salsa juice ran out making it a little hard to unwrap bc the paper stuck a little.  AND the black beans made it a little dry tasting but nothing a little Crystals hot sauce didn't fix.  Enjoy.
Edit 3: protein amount

*EDIT*: after all the griping about the nutrition of the burrito... I'm officially changing the title to ""I make batches of burritos that are relatively healthy, **FAST** , **EASY** and **CHEAP**..."" Factor all those in please.

I've had years of serious training, years of fuckarounditis, years of complete sedentary due to lumbar disc injury, I've even worked as a personal trainer. 

Read and re-read the FAQ, a lot of what I'm saying is already there.

Before I begin with tons of randomness, I want to say that there is no 100% right way to train or to eat, no perfect program or diet, and knowing your own body and its reactions to things like stress, training, rep-range, nutrition, macros, etc, is the only way to maximizing progress. Therefore, I cannot ever begin to suggest what will work for you, only what's worked for me in hopes that you can formulate your own plans using some of these tips. Trial and error is your best friend, don't be afraid to fail - as long as you get up, dust yourself off, and try again.

**Training for Hypertrophy, opposed to Strength training**

I'm sure the vast majority of people browsing r/fitness are training for vanity - they want to get big and lean. I know strength is a huge theme for r/fitness, too, but overall, people start training to gain muscle, not strength.

I too trained for years for hypertrophy alone, mostly in the 8-12 rep range. While I made much progress, I rarely increased the load, and progress would often halt until I changed up my programming. Broscience often got in the way of doing what really needed to be done, and that's to build a solid foundation of strength before ever trying to train for hypertrophy.

Even though I had what most would consider a very solid foundation already, after my ""off"" period due to major lumbar injury and surgery, I decided to work on strength over hypertrophy. 

Starting Strength is known as a beginner program, but it's for anyone looking to maximize linear progression in terms of strength - something that is very important to anyone interested in getting ""big"". The results were astounding, and I have progressed more in terms of load numbers on six months than I had in six years of hypertrophy training. As a result, I also put on a great deal of muscle mass, and lost bodyfat. Granted, I was very overweight at the beginning, and much of my gains were through muscle-memory, but I've greatly exceeded where I was prior to my injury (and at that time I was a personal trainer).

Since my linear progress slowed, I decided to switch back to a hypertrophy routine. And while yes, I increase my load less often, I'm getting much better results in growth due to how heavy a load I can handle for higher rep counts. Nearly double where I was when I was training for hypertrophy. Plus, my core is stronger, I'm more resistant to injury, etc. I do still include heavy compound movements in every session - I feel this is a must.

Another important tip: *Stick to your program*. Results take time. If you're not seeing any results after 3-6 months, then rethink. But you'll never see a major improvement in just weeks.

**Diet and Nutrition for Maximizing Gains**

Eat. Eat. Eat. *And eat some more*. There's not much more too it. Any and all ""hardgainers"" just aren't eating enough. There are fast metabolisms, but you are likely still just not eating enough. If you're lucky enough to have a fast metabolism, you can get away with eating less than ""clean"" foods and still make progress while staying generally lean. Look for calorie dense foods like whole milk, peanut butter, and beef. Total calories in are more important than calorie timing, but I find that feeding every 2-3 hours is easier to bulk than consuming huge meals that leave you feeling like you ate a few bricks.

**Diet and Nutrition for Recomposition and Fat Loss**

Most gurus will tell you that recomposition is nearly impossible, or at least extremely difficult, and to instead choose to cut or bulk. If you're heavy, or were heavy, it's scary to eat as much food that is necessary to bulk, so recomp is likely the best way for your comfort zone.

Recomposition is possible, as long as you plan according to your training schedule. Carbs are required to replenish spent glycogen stores in muscles, allowing for proteins to rebuild muscle fibers. As such, eating plenty of carbs on the days you train to refuel your muscles is vital to growth. But on your ""off"" days, drop carb intake to a moderate level, and increase your healthy fat intake. Things like avacado, salmon, and almonds are excellent sources of healthy fats. Use calorie calculators, and macro-nutrient calculators to find out your maintenance intake, then add 500 calories to your training days, and subtract 500 calories on your off days. Progress will indeed be slower, but it is possible.

For fat loss, as simple as this may sound, but you must lower your calorie intake. How low you reduce your calories below maintenance by (250-500 is recommended) is up to you and how fast you want to lose weight. Total calories consumed is the most important part of any diet, but paying close attention to macros is also important. Lower, to moderate carbs are best for losing fat. And it's a good idea to cycle your total calories consumed and carbohydrates, to prevent homeostasis from occurring. 

Whether you are trying to gain mass, recomp, or to lose fat, I cannot stress enough the importance of properly tracking calories. Do it for a few days, and I guarantee you will realize that you are missing your target calories. Even the slightest discrepancy could negate progress, so pay attention, write it down, and adjust accordingly.

**Cardio for Fat-loss**

Cardio is wonderful for conditioning and overall health, but it can feel like a chore. To maximize your fat loss through cardio, a combination of HIIT cardio and low-intensity cardio is best.

What's always worked best for me is 10-20 minutes of sprints, 30 seconds of all out sprinting followed by 30 seconds of active rest until your time is up. Whatever you can handle at first, slowly building to 20 minutes. Going over 20 minutes isn't recommended as it can eat into your gains or cause muscle loss at a calorie deficit.

Low-intensity cardio, like long medium-power walks, roughly 40-60 minutes twice a week in a fasted state are key. To reduce muscle loss on a calorie deficit, consume some BCAAs before low-intensity cardio in a fasted state.

**More Random Tips**

Back pain? Always check with a doctor first. If it's a severe injury, rest is the only option, followed by controlled rehabilitation. Don't overlook or train through pain, it will cost you. If the back pain is moderate, you need to reexamine your form, focus more on mobility and flexibility, especially in the posterior chain (hams, glutes, lower back), and strengthen your core. I highly recommend a book/program called Foundation by Eric Goodman and Peter Park. After two herniated disks, lumbar surgery, and years of pain/pain meds, this program got me back into the gym, and I'm deadlifting nearly 400lbs again with no pain.

Can't do a pull-up/chin-up? Don't do assisted movements, and instead opt for negatives instead. You'll soon be able to perform even one full chin/pull up. One turns into two, then three. Keep going until you can reach a full set. Keep mixing in the negatives with full reps until you can perform a full set.

Supplements? Caffeine, Fish Oil, and Creatine. You don't even need protein powder if you're eating enough. Protein powder like Whey or Casein are for convenience and cost. I do recommend them, but they're not the holy grail some people think they are. Other supplements do indeed work, but they're likely not worth their cost. That all comes down to how much you want to spend - but do your research first. Examine.com is an excellent resource. I personally use Scivation Xtend in the AM, along with a pre-workout mix (Jack3d usually), then for post, I consume 8 ounces of grape juice and a scoop or Optimum Nutrition Whey. At nights, to keep calories down, I have a scoop of ON Casein if I don't feel like eating.

Rest! Get 8 or more hours of sleep if possible, or as close as you can. If you can't, try to nap. Make sure you're taking at least one day off a week, preferably more. Remember, growth takes place during rest. Training just provides the stimulus that triggers growth reactions. Those triggers are no good without the building blocks (calories/macros) and rest.

Routine and Dedication. No diet or training program will ever work well if you're half-assing it. I suggest logging every workout, ever meal, ever calorie, etc. Keep to your schedule, stay motivated and dedicated. If you can't, you only have yourself to blame for lack of progress. I understand life gets in the way, as does injury, sickness, etc. These cannot be avoided at times, but as long as you are giving it your all, you cannot be stopped.

**Closing**

Pretty much all of this is common sense, and it's in the FAQ. I've wasted years at a time by listening to broscience or mens fitness magazines. Instead, stick to tried and true methods that come from real life experience, blood, sweat, and tears, and you will go far.

**Personal Story**

I just came off a five year hiatus due to severe injury, pain, and lack of confidence, strength, and self-worth. One day, something clicked inside me, telling me to not let the pain control me anymore. Now, I've lost 75 lbs while gaining significant amounts of muscle, increasing my strength to advanced levels (for example, I went 135 &gt; 345 sqauts/3x5 in six months). I'm healthy, I'm strong, I'm happy, and I honestly cannot believe it, I'm pain-free. Sure I wake up with stiffness and have worse days than others, but compared to where I was just a year ago, I am a new man. I owe it to smart programming, strict diet, determination, but most of all, knowing my body, listening to it, and adjusting when necessary. It's something that usually comes after years of experience, but learning to channel it early on can lead to less trial and error, and faster progress.",,False,,t5_2qhx4,False,,,True,t3_11dbsf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/11dbsf/random_tips_from_10_years_of_experience_being/,
1367075267.0,795,self.Fitness,1d7v1a,My lifting buddy broke his back last fall. When he returned to the gym he got more than he bargained for.,1792,997,332,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1d7v1a/my_lifting_buddy_broke_his_back_last_fall_when_he/,"So a little ""back"" story, the friend of mine who we'll call Randall, made fitness his life. We were friends all through highschool and he got this fitness bug that bit him in the ass and never let go. He went to work as a sports trainer for a local gym and has worked there and loved it there for 8 years (we're 24 and 23 respectively so that's been a major part of his life). He went to school and got degrees in biology and chemistry so he could learn the body and it's processes better.

Last fall however he was in a really fucking terrible accident. He flipped his car, was drug out of his sunroof and broke his back. It was bad, real bad. I remember sitting at the hospital with all of our friends not knowing if he was going to walk again or even live. I remember a nurse saying the pain was so intense for him that if they didn't keep him sedated he would immediately go into shock.

Long story short, after an emergency surgery on his back in which they fused steel rods to his spine. He was able to walk again. They told him he wouldn't be able to lift again for years beyond small weights no heavier than a gallon of milk. Then came the crippling depression. His whole life's work had just been ended. And with an endless supply of high power pain killers. His hole just sank deeper into the ground. He was in a bad way. 

Finally, after months of physical and emotional pain. Randall decided he was going to get up and go to the gym. If he was going to be in pain, than goddamnit if his muscles wouldn't be too.  So he went, lifting light at first, surprised at the little amount of weight he could handle after all this time competition lifting. But after time his body adapted. Everyone including myself told him to chill out and slow down, but the mother fucker didn't. One day, I walked into the back room where the shock mat is and saw him loading plates onto the bar preparing for his first dead lift. I yelled at him to stop, he didn't break gaze and looked directly ahead and just said fuck you. 

Now it's been about 8 months since his accident and he just got back from a competition where he placed third after pulling 550lbs. After so many months of blood, sweat and tears of getting back to where he was. The gym fired him.

It was a bogus reason I assure you, claimed he didn't show up on a day they told him he was scheduled to. This hurt him, a lot. He quite literally helped build that gym from the ground up. Made it a pillar of the community and I would say that more than half of the clientele come there because of him.

Now just as he got back on his feet, his world is crushed once again. I wish I had another story of triumph to share with you all, but I don't. They took away everything he loved and I wish I knew what to do for him. If any of you have any advice I would surely appreciate it.",,False,,t5_2qhx4,1367097754.0,,,True,t3_1d7v1a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1d7v1a/my_lifting_buddy_broke_his_back_last_fall_when_he/,

I was at my gym doing deadlifts next to a guy who was doing biceps curls. After he saw what I was doing, he approached me and told me that I was insane for doing what I was doing.

Anyway, he kept watching me throughout my deadlift routine between his biceps sets. 

So, as I was about to start my last set, he went behind my back while I was already holding the barbell, then proceeded to lift my t-shirt and touched my lower back and then said 'ahhh, these are the muscles you stress with this exercise'. He watched me do my last set and strolled back to his dumbells to finish up his full-blown biceps workout. 

TL;DR I have strange people with well defined biceps at my gym.

*Sorry for my faulty English, not a native speaker*

Edit: since this post got a bigger than I thought, I probably should add some more context. The dude and I had a little conversation and I think he thought we were bros - yes I am a dude - and even though the whole incident was really awkward, I didn't feel that I should tell him to fuck off or as some here suggested break his nose. As I said in the comments before, the dude wasn't the brightest and starting some shit over it would have been embarrissing to all of us. Now that I think of it, I have to laugh, and my friends had who I told about this story laughed as well. Yes it was awkward and he stepped over the line but now looking back, I don't feel bad for not calling him out. Aaaanyway, while I am on a writing rant, I would like to thank you guys for contributing to this subreddit. I learned a lot over the past few months and I getting closer to my goal. Also, for those who are really serious about abs and cutting, I'd recommend to look into r/leangains; it helped me a lot! Enjoy your weekend and keep lifting.

Those who make it above 1,000lbs with Bench Press, Deadlifts, and Squats combined will forever get their name on the gym wall. I've never done one of these before but I said what the hell I'm almost out of here and what better way to make my mark on this place. When I first got here I was pretty out of shape. I let myself go and was pretty weak. When your deployed you really have nothing better to do so most people turn into hard core gym rats. I was one of these people. I'll go ahead and get to the crux of this post. I feel like I've come along way. Here is where I was when I first got here 8 months ago:

220 lbs
17% body fat
Bench Press: 185
Squat: 265
Deadlift: 295

Here's where I am today: 

198
11% bodyfat
Bench Press: 255
Squat: 355
Deadlift 430

Total 1,040 lbs.

Here's a pic of me deadlifting the 430lbs today. http://i.imgur.com/z4rRx.jpg

So that's my progress so far. Very proud day for me today which made my Christmas out here despite being away from my wife and son, still a good one! I have to more months left to go before I come back. I'm gonna start the Ultimate Diet 2.0 next week and see where that takes me. Thanks for reading, and Merry Christmas everyone!

Edit: pointed out by one of the redditors: The 17% BF for my starting point doesn't add up. The starting BF% I got using the BMI formula which is not an accurate or reliable method...I was probably closer to 20% and looking at pictures of where I was 8 months ago...Yup I was a fat ass.

Should we try to tip the balance of rewards back toward fitness, and away from karma-whoring?",1449,665,404,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/iba3u/fittit_what_do_you_think_should_we_try_to_tip_the/,"/r/fittit has grown.  We had something like 20,000 readers a little over a year ago, and now we're up to 70,000.  In just the past 6 months, the daily unique views have grown by a factor of six.  

This is pretty thrilling.  It's great to be in a focused online community, interested in fitness.  The mods try to make this a better place, every day. 

Even so, we still get complaints.  We could be more welcoming to newbies.  Are we too focused on certain types of fitness?  

A main source of complaints recently has been the place of images and video.  One doesn't have to stare at the ""new"" feed for long to realize that many of the images which get posted are kind of perhaps maybe topical to fitness; but they don't necessarily encourage fitness, or reward fitness -- and those are our community goals.  Sometimes it's obvious what's going on: the OP's karma-whoring.  With such a suddenly large community, it's also suddenly a useful place to karma-whore.

Everyone likes a really good joke image, or one of those high-larious f7u12 comics.  But the reward for participating at /r/fitness isn't primarily karma -- it's *fitness*. 

Even so, images and video are still often useful for fitness purposes.  There are progress pics (sometimes we get complaints about those, too -- but it's encouraging to see someone who has improved, and it's great to get feedback when you yourself have improved); there's a particularly useful ""how to squat"" video.  There's a lot of examples.  

So a question the mods are considering: how do we keep the community focused on fitness, and less on karma-whoring?

And, an idea popped into our heads: what if we change policy, such that pics and video are welcome, but only when linked within the text of a ""self""post (that is, for no karma reward)?  

While generic external links are still welcome, such links which are simply direct image links (like to imugr.com) or to video (like to youtube.com) would be mod-removed (yep, even if they've gotten upvotes!)   And, if you really think that image of the thinking dinosaur is important to post to /r/fitness, you can still post it -- you just aren't going to get karma for it.  The implication being, if the only thing you get out of posting an image is karma (and not, say, a better fitness experience, which should be your focus here) then don't post it. 

Some of the mods like the idea.  Some of them aren't so sure. The main question being: will this make for a better /r/fitness community? It might be worth trying on a trial basis, and we're talking about it.  It'd be useful to know what could go wrong with such a policy, before committing to it long term.  

What do you think?

I wish I had better before pictures (ie: shirtless) but I hated pictures back then for obvious reason. I scaled the images using facial features though so it should give you an idea of how wide I was. I mostly had a huge belly and ass. Also, sorry about the shit quality it's a 6 year old camera that was cheap when I got it.

**What it was like:**

- Fat and self-conscious. Constantly thinking about my weight and how shitty I looked. I really did not take well to being overweight. It was crippling how much it consumed my thought.

- Alcoholic. Drank 6-20 drinks a day, usually on the higher side, usually alone, usually with weed.

- Depressed and anxiety ridden. Recently graduated. Terrified of the real world.

- Hobbies consisted of getting high and drunk and playing computer games or jerking it.

- Uncomfortable, out-of-place, pessimistic and discontent.

**What it's like now:**

- Feel fit. Don't really think about my body, as it does and it looks like what I want it to.

- Sober. Active service member of Alcoholics Anonymous. 

- Usually in a good mood. Getting professional treatment for my anxiety disorder. Have a well paying job coding Java and looking forward to even better professional opportunities in the future.

- Hobbies include zen meditation, kickin it with my AA youth fellowship, swimming, writing a book about the science of fitness and nutrition (with accessibility in mind), reading actual books, drawing/painting, and starting in May I will be training with an olympic weightlifting coach 3x a week. Oh and playing pc games :P, but significantly less and only on the weekend.

- Generally happy, optimistic/forward-looking.

**What I did:**

- Made the following changes, not all at once, but very slowly and gradually over the course of 7months:

- Caloric deficit

- &lt;100g carbs a day from low GI foods, usually pre and post workout. &gt;150g protein a day.

- Intermittent Fasting.

- Lifted. Started out with textbook SS. After I just couldn't make any more gains (squat 240lbs, dead 295, bench 190, ohp 125) because of caloric deficit kinda got fuckarounditis. Switched over to high-bar, doing oly lift drills, experimented w/ different lifts. Whatever, goal was fat loss. Will start eating more and actually getting strong when I work with my oly coach in may.

- Rest days: sometimes swimming, sprints, jogging. Usually just mobility, stretching, pre-hab with a good podcast on (haven't had any injuries but I'm terrified of them, everyone should probably do this stuff anyways).

- Hit my alcoholic bottom, went to the hospital for acute withdrawal/demor tremens, detoxed in outpatient rehab, got introduced to AA (this actually happened a few months in to my diet/fitness transformation)

- Left my ego behind. Realized if I could get fit and sober alone it would have happened a long time ago.

- Constantly nerding out over fitness online.

Anyways. I'm on the last legs of this looonnng diet. Probably another few weeks then I'm ready to eat more. It's psychologically daunting but I'm sick of being weak and eventually want to compete in olympic lifting recreationally at least.

Just for the hell of it.

At my largest I was 350lbs (I'm 6'2"" just for reference). I've been overweight my entire life. In 5th grade I was 180lbs. Last year I decided to make a change. I made the switch to veganism and I hike four miles every day. If you have any questions feel free to ask! Also, note the same patch on my pants in picture one and two for a little confirmation. 

My workout consists of an early morning hike to [Heart Rock](http://www.1000wordsphotos.com/heartrock/heartrock3-c.jpg). It's two miles there and two back. I do 80 squats, 100 sit-ups (knees up position), 30 proper push ups, 50 leg lifts. For my dumbbell routine I have twenty pound weights, I'm not too familiar with the names of anything but curls but I target each specific group in a 20-30 minute routine.

I feel so much better. The biggest difference physically is I don't have joint pain anymore. I can breathe so much easier now as well. There's a lot to get used to, spatial reasoning for example. I can sit between people on a bench comfortably but I still get that moment of doubt. Mentally I'm a lot more content, far less hostile. I don't eat to the point of discomfort anymore. I can say ""I'm done"" when I feel full instead of when the plate is empty.

""Well me and my friend were about to do abs you wanna join in?""

At this point, I had no idea he was a Patriots player. I'm a Giants fan for starters (this was in NJ) but I could tell that this guy knew what he was doing because he was really built. So I agreed.

He led his friend and myself through ""4 quarters"" as he said of abs, doing tons of different types of leg lifts and sit ups and planks and exercises I had never done before. He was completely kicking both of our asses too. We kept collapsing in the middle of these ""quarters"" and having to start over again.

At the end of it, I thanked him for letting me work out with them, and asked him ""are you a trainer?"" and he responded ""something like that"" and he walked away leaving me with his friend for a second. So I said to his friend ""man, your friend is insane!""

I was super surprised, and as I was leaving the gym he was leaving too, and no one else was around (I didn't want to draw attention to him and get him swarmed or something) and I called over to him and told him thanks again and that I wasn't expecting to get to work out with an NFL player when I walked into the gym. He responded ""hey, we're all just doing our thing in there man.""

**EDIT: This is as much of the ab workout as I can remember**

**FIRST QUARTER:**
Start laying fully straight out on your back, put your hands behind your head and crunch up a tiny bit, and then lift your legs 6 inches off the ground and hold for 20-30 seconds. Then lift your legs up to a 45 degree angle, and again hold for around 20-30 seconds. Finally, lift your legs to as much of a full 90 degree as you can manage, and again hold for 20-30 second. Once you're done holding, starting doing crunches, trying to reach up and touch your toes. Do 25. Then lower your left leg to a 45 degree angle while keeping your right leg straight up, and touch your left hand to your right foot 25 times. Then switch legs and do it right hand to left foot 25 times. That's as much as I remember from the first quarter. That's most of it.

**SECOND QUARTER:**
Start out in a plank, hold for 45 seconds. Now lift up your right leg, hold for 30 seconds. Switch legs, hold again for 30 seconds. Now lift up your left foot and right hand, hold for 30 seconds. Switch, hold again for 30 seconds. Switch to a side plank on your right side. Point your left hand straight up, and make circles in the air with your pointer finger. Hold this for 1 minute. Then, with your left hand, reach down underneath you and ""scoop"" and come all the way back up with your hand. Do this 25 times. Then do 25 ""bounces,"" basically just hold the plank but bounce up and down with your hips. Once you have finished on your right side, switch over to your left side and do the same stuff.

**THIRD QUARTER:**
Here is where I'm starting to forget a lot of stuff, so I'll just list as much as I can remember.

* Bicycles (50)

* Something like a candlestick pull, but without actually holding on to anything. Same idea though, you basically are lifting your legs all the way up. Probably like 25.

I don't remember much more than this. Sorry that I'm being forgetful everyone. It was a lot of stuff really rapid fire and I had a tough enough time just trying to keep up! Hope this is helpful though to everyone that wanted it.




TL/DR: Went to the gym, big guy asked me if I wanted to work out with him and his friend, I said sure and he led a little ab workshop. Turns out he's a linebacker for the Patriots, [Jermaine Cunningham](http://www.nfl.com/player/jermainecunningham/496772/profile)

NSV: My thighs don't touch each other anymore! And this is the heaviest I’ve been in my life! I’m 172 cm (~5’8”) and 23-years old. 

QUESTION: Do you think I am too bulky? My arms have gotten quite big and people comment on their size all the time. I’m too self-conscious to wear tank tops now. :-/ 

**Routine** (I switched up my routine a lot because I get bored easily, but generally this was what I did):

Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday: some combination of squat, bench press, overhead press, deadlift, power clean, clean and jerk, chin-ups, or pull-ups. See Starting Strength aka the Bible. 

Monday, Wednesday, Friday: 3-hours of Brazilian Jiujitsu training each day, which usually included at least 30 minutes of High-Intensity Interval Training (sprints, push-ups, abs, jump squats) and/or a few tabattas. I don’t think my lifts progressed as much as they would have if I hadn’t been doing 9-hours of BJJ with intensive cardio every week, but BJJ is my life, so... 

Saturday: Either long-distance biking, running, or more BJJ

**Lifts** (I hurt my shoulder in April, which stalled many of my lifts):

These are all for 5x3 rep sets: 

Squat: from 45 kg (100 lbs) to 85 kg (187 lbs).

Bench: from 30 kg (66 lbs) to 45 kg (100 lbs)

Overhead Press: from 25 kg (55 lbs) to 40 kg (88 lbs)

Deadlift (this one is for a 5x1 rep set): from 40 kg (88 lbs) to 90 kg (198 lbs)

Power Clean: from 25 kg (55 lbs) to 45 kg (100 lbs)

Chin-ups: from none to 5 

Pull-ups: None. Still can’t do one real pull-up. That is my next major goal.

**Diet**: 

Mainly, I focused on getting enough protein, usually 150-200 grams a day. I drank Whey protein shakes for the first couple months and then switched to BSN Syntha-6. Besides a multivitamin, I don’t take any supplements. Since I live in China, my food choices are somewhat different than what you might find in the States. I mostly eat eggs, chicken, pork, tofu, fruit, peanuts, almonds, spinach, tomatoes, yogurt, potatoes, rice, and noodles. I try to eat clean, but I usually have a cheat day about once a week where I will eat fast food, ice cream, or lots of carbs. I never drink alcohol or do drugs. 

I did not follow GOMAD. I experimented with the Paleo diet and other low-carb diets for the first couple months, but I found my energy levels were very low. I started eating carbs again in April and was taking in about  2,000-3,000 calories a day. I then switched to Intermittent Fasting in May, taking in about 2,500 calories a day in an eight-hour window. IF is my favorite diet so far. I like IF because I tend to binge eat, so eating everything in eight hours works for me. It also prevents the late-night binge fests that I’m prone to. See /r/leangains. 

**My story** (I’m writing this especially to inspire other women to lift heavy and for women struggling with eating disorders): 

I’ve always been skinny and athletic. I ran cross-country in high school and played rugby in college. For the most part, however, I’ve always hated my body and have borderline exercise bulimia tendencies. I graduated from college in May 2011 and moved to China. I lurked on fittit for months. I started working out everyday on my own, usually running long distances and doing some combination of abs, push-ups, kipping pull-ups, and sprinting. I started training Brazilian Jiujitsu (BJJ) in October 2011 and I was no match for the strength of the other guys on my team. A friend told me that I worked out like a girl. I was pretty offended by that. He said it meant that I did lots of cardio just to stay as skinny as possible while trying to get nice abs, which was true. Two other friends told me that they thought I looked like I had an eating disorder. I was even more offended by that, but I had to admit that it was true. I was 60 kg (130 lbs) at that point, but I still felt really fat next to the super skinny Chinese girls.

I generally have a poor body image and I developed a bad habit of binge eating. So when I started getting skinny fat in December 2011 despite working out for at least an hour everyday, I was pretty miserable. I studied the FAQ on /r/fitness like it was a religion. I was very hesitant to start weight lifting. I was just scared of the fact that I didn’t know what I was doing. The community on /r/fitness was an incredible inspiration. I definitely would not have even thought to start doing the compound lifts without the fittit FAQ, the female SS progress pics and reports, and the constant encouragement from the men of /r/fitness for women to lift weights. I bought the Kindle version of Starting Strength and the rest is history. 

After I’d been lifting for about a month, I was at BJJ training and my coach said, “Girl, you’re getting stronger.” Since then, my teammates have commented numerous times on how much stronger I’ve gotten these past few months. I've also struggled with hip problems for the last several years, and my hip pain has completely vanished since I started doing squats! The best thing, however, is that for the first time in several years, I’m actually happy with the body that I see in the mirror. And I’m not starving myself. Feels good, man. That being said, I’m nowhere near finished with improving myself, my body, my fitness, and my lifts. 

To all the women out there: I know how terrifying and intimidating it is to lift in a power rack for the first time. After that first initial set, the fear goes away! It feels so natural to lift without a machine, the way our bodies were made to lift. I almost forget how scared I was on that first day, scared as if I was going to get killed by the barbell or something. Now I have to confidence to lift on my own in a power rack. [Here is a video of me squatting 80 kilos.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-nbLz_gphM&amp;feature=plcp) I know my form is not that great, I've been working on it. Just wanted to show this to any women who were curious what squatz look like. 

Lifting is the best natural high in the world. And that’s saying something coming from a long-distance runner. When I first started, I felt like I was flying every time I walked out of the gym. 

I can't say enough how much I encourage all of you to go out there and start barbell training. Arm yourself with knowledge and go out there to prove to everyone wrong (and prove the fittit community right). 

**TL;DR**: A big thanks to fittit for encouraging women to lift the same way as men: I never would have considered starting SS if it hadn't been for this cyber community (who is perhaps a tad fanatical about their love for Rippetoe) and the ~~male~~ members who consistently advocate similar training programs for men and women.

A year ago I decided to change my life. Who knew changing you health and physique would change other aspects of life. I feel great, got over a bad break up, and landed a job after so many months of searching. Feels damn good. 

I had a 3 day routine that recently became 4 days. 

Day 1: chest, back, and shoulders
Day 2: biceps, triceps, legs (not too focused on legs) 
Day 3: cardio and abs
Day 4: running (either around neighborhood or treadmill) 

Then I repeat this. I change up the exercises and switch from barbell to free weights, etc.

I drink pre-workout, protein, vitamins, and omega 3 fatty acids. I eat 5 meals a day, usually a peanut butter sandwich is one of them. Just use common sense for other meals. No fast or fried food, lean meats, low carbs, stuff like that. 

Here is the before and after:

1344301156.0,771,self.Fitness,xspvr,I did the first unassisted chin-up of my LIFE today :) My fitness story- 3 years in the making (F),1140,369,165,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/xspvr/i_did_the_first_unassisted_chinup_of_my_life/,"http://i.imgur.com/W9f5Sl.jpg

Three years of steady progress and I achieved my first chin-up today!!! I know it seems trivial, but it’s something I once thought I would never do!
After college I was up to 145 pounds. I got home and immediately started Weight Watchers. I got lucky, since my mom had so many materials. I never paid or went to meetings, but I dropped to 135 lbs over that summer.

I stayed around this weight until someone spectacular entered my life, and I decided I’d like to run. Instead of focusing on losing weight, for the first time in my life I focused on becoming physically fit. I went from running a ¼ mile at a time to running a 5K by the next spring. Although I worked at my own pace, I pretty much followed the Couch to 5K method.

I injured my calf at the end of the summer, as I had never really exercised before and I wasn’t ready for the strain, but joined a gym last October. Since then, I’ve been weight training, using the elliptical trainer, and attending yoga classes (which make SUCH a difference to your overall movement ability!) 

I haven’t followed Weight Watchers in a couple years, but I track all my food using the My Fitness Pal app. I log all of my exercise (I know they say not to, but I like to earn the extra food) but set my net calories at 1200, so I end up eating about 1500-1600 calories a day. 

I cut out white bread, sugar and potatoes completely a month ago, and lost 2 more pounds after I had been stable since November. My macros end up about 30-40% carbs, 20-25% protein and about 35% fat. I still eat what I want to on the weekends…

So, I went from completely non-physically fit to squats, leg presses and CHIN UPS! I have never in my entire life succeeded at doing this, even in primary school! 

145 pounds to 114 pounds
Size 8 to size 2! 

I hope this inspires someone. My life completely changed when I bought a $50 treadmill on Craigslist and used it only as much as I could. That endurance kept increasing, and an accumulation of small life changes became a big one.

One of the biggest motivators to me is having other similarly minded people to talk to. 


I'm going to try and include all the pertinent info I can while describing what I've done during 2012. Please let me know if I left anything out that would be helpful.

As the title says, I am a 6'3'' and 24 years old. I started my fitness journey on Jan 1st very underweight at 165lbs. I was taking some medicine at the end of 2011 that curbed my appetite. Once I stopped taking that I quickly bounced back up to 175lbs, so my 28 pounds gained this year are a little misleading.

For January and February I was doing p90x in my apartment but quickly realized I wasn't going to put on much weight that way. I worked out without direction for the next few months, using my apartments undersized gym and not really utilizing a program. I signed up for a gym in May then on June 5th decided to start lifting seriously to put on mass. I have been doing a 3 day bodybuilding type split since then. (admittedly I did not give my legs enough attention until recently)

My typical workouts are below, I generally try to complete 3x10 for every exercise but go to failure around 6-8 on the third set for some exercises. Lately, I've been doing 4 sets of many chest movements going 10,8,5ish, then back up to 10 by dropping the weight.

Chest/Triceps:

* Flat Bench - alternate days between dumbell and barbell
* Incline - almost always dumbell, alternate days where I will do this before flat
* Dips - Either unweighted 3x20ish or weighted 3x10
* Flys - On Machine, this hurts my shoulders less
* Push downs
* Pulldowns 
* Sometimes finish with a variety of push ups
* Sometimes finish with machines if I feel I haven't hit my chest hard enough

Back/biceps:

* Pull ups - Pyramid, 3x10, weighted, and different grips depending on what I'm feeling that day
* Rows - 2 out of 3 of cable, dumbell, or pendlay rows
* Lower back extentions
* Recently starting adding in deadlifts, my old gym didn't have a platform or rack 
* Back flys
* A variety of curls if needed

Legs/Shoulders:

* Leg press on machine
* Leg extention
* Leg curls
* Calf Raises
* Overhead press (always dumbell)
* Shrugs (almost always barbell)
* Diagonal raises
* Combo later and rear delt raise
* Face Pulls
* 
Abs: I try to mix these in every other lift but I've been bad about it

* Either p90x ab ripper or some weighted sit ups on a decline bench with some V twists mixed in

Lift Numbers
Bench: 1 repped 225 the other day for my PR, if I'm using dumbells I'm using 80's or 85's lately
OHP: 60 lb dumbells for 120lbs total
Leg press: I generally work my way up to 450lbs over a few sets then come back down. The sled is on a 45 degree angle so I realize my true squat would be much less.
Deadlift: I've just begun deadlifting again, trying to remember the proper form. I injured my lower back in highschool which has made deadlifting a little uncomfortable. I've just been working with 135 lately.

Food: I count my calories every couple weeks to make sure I'm getting close to my goal of 3500-4000 calories. Other than that I just try to eat fairly healthy and get a lot of protein. Through this year I have used two tubs of NOxplode for a preworkout, I've been taking creatine the past couple months, and I've been using a muscle milk protein powder for shakes afterwards (I've found its one of the few that doesn't seriously upset my stomach).

Plans for the future. I plan on continuing to add weight until April where I will reassess and determine if I want to cut for the summer. I would really like to be up over 200lbs.


Other info: I have been in decent shape before, my highest weight in 2010 was 187 so I think this is one of those cases where it is easy to gain back lost muscle once you've done it before. Also, I played volleyball for my highschool and college and have sustained many injuries during those years. Mainly overuse to my shoulder (rotator cuff), knees, and lower back. I have modified my lifts accordingly and its one of the reasons my legs have been a little neglected.

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/gKgE8): Sorry about the lighting being slight different in the before and after pictures, it was the best I could do.

Let my know if you have any questions or advice to give me. I would love to here if you think I'm progressing proportionally, I really feel like my chest is lagging.

Thanks!

Routine:  Started with SL5x5 with an empty barbell for all lifts,  but moved that down to 3 sets like SS as the weights got heavier. Have also moved back to lifting heavy twice a week as I added endurance training into my regiment (cycling, rowing, or swimming 4hours/week). I have never tried to 1RM, so I listed my current work weights. (I have been through several cycles of deloading, and dealt with two injuries over the past year.

Bench: 45 to 165 

Deadlift: 45 to 220 

OHP: 45 to 125

Penlay Rows: 45 to 135

Diet:  Learned about Paleo about 6 weeks after I started this process on Aug 21st 2011. Switching to a low-carb Primal style paleo diet was a life changer for me and has been the main factor in keeping me consistent/on track for the past year. Never really worry about counting calories or macros; just ate when I was hungry and stopped eating when I was full. I still have cheat meals on weekends and don't bog down if a restaurant doesn't have meats and veggies for me to eat (which is unusual). I have added in sweet potatoes and other healthy carbs to recover glycogen after long endurance training. I plateau'd at 195lbs, and started experimenting with IF and Leangains over the past month or so. This really just means that I have cut out breakfast and eat two large meals between noon and 8:00pm. This one less meal has helped get my calorie deficit right for a 190-pounder. Still going slow and still adjusting. 

Supplements: Vitamin D , Fish Oil , Calcium , Zinc , Magnesium , and Whey protein after heavy lifts . 

New Goals : More strength gains , more recomp (would like to get down to 15% bf) , overall health. 

Questions for Fittit:  Would someone kindly assess my current bf%?  Also I have started doing more research on novice strength programs and am not sure when I should switch. Does anyone have suggestions? If my primary goals are strength and recomp.

Edit to add training/diet/height

Let me preface by stating that I am by NO means a nutritionist or dieting master, but this is PRECISELY what my diet consists of day by day and has clearly worked for me. I am well aware of oatz, squatz, brown rice, etc. Lol

Training days are M-F. 

**Diet on training days (2000 calories)**: 

* Breakfast - 2 pieces of 14 grain whole wheat toast, 3 whole eggs, 1 serving of almonds, and 1 banana.
* Pre-workout - Single scoop protein shake
* Post-workout - Double scoop protein shake, banana
* Lunch - 2 pieces toast, 4oz chicken breast, 1 cup mixed, sauteed veggies (broccoli, mushrooms, red/green peppers), 1 serving of almonds
* Dinner - Same as lunch.
* Late night - Single scoop protein shake

Diet on off-days is precisely the same minus 2 pieces of bread and a protein shake (1800 total calories). Re-feed days of 2700 calories and as many carbs as I can eat after week 5, 8, and 11.

**Training program**

* Monday: Strength training on chest, tris, abs, and a little bit of calves for 2 hours followed by 30 minutes/9 miles on stationary bike.
* Tuesday: 2 hours strength training on back/bis, 30 minutes/9 miles on stationary bike.
* Wednesday: 2 hours strength training on legs, 30 minutes/9 miles on stationary bike.
* Thursday: 2 hours strength training on shoulders, 30 minutes/9 miles on stationary bike.
* Friday: 2 hours strength training on arms/abs/calves, 30 minutes/9 miles on stationary bike.

Someone suggested incorporating calorie information for each ingredient (or maybe just the hard to find/calorie dense ones). Would you guys like this? Might take some time but I'll do it if it'll help people out!

My channel is http://youtube.com/dhftns

Here are a few of my newer videos:

Protein Peanut Butter Cookies: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLmcTE0A4F4

Cauliflower Pizza: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjYz-RFxa1Q

Bodybuilding Chicken Chili: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNA0Ri17QwE

Protein Cornbread: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJqLYJerOXA

and if you don't have access to youtube I have all of the recipes/calorie information up on my website http://dhftns.com as well in text/printable form (sorry for spamming so much stuff)

Things I implemented (or tried my best to) from all of your feedback:

Talk normal (no more yelling/caffeine!)

Recipe/calorie information on the youtube channel itself

Tried my best to shorten them

Incorporated different music rather than the same old piano in the speedy bits

Ingredients by grams and ounces

Some workout tips here and there in them

I only show the ingredient text, no more showing it twice

More food recipes (that don't need protein powder)

Thank you Reddit!

Accomplished more than I thought possible but I'm not done yet!,1036,267,323,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1ga3tc/progress_thanks_rfitness_6_months_from_skinnyfat/,"6 months ago I was skinny-fat. Sure I'd have liked to look better but I had the notion that it would require way too much effort than it was worth. Thanks to /r/fitness I was inspired to change and it's been completely worth it. I've progressed further than I ever thought I would, and have open my eyes to how far I could potentially go.

**Goals going in**

Aesthetics. Getting strong is nice but I wanted to look good as my top priority (vain, I know)

**Progress**

[Here is my progress album [Warning: dude in underwear]](http://imgur.com/a/6uwV4) (Approximately monthly updates. ~~Sorry about lack of after legs, I'll try to get a pic in.~~ Leg pic in the edit below)

**My Stats:**

* 23M / 6'1""
* Weight: 183lbs -&gt; 170lbs

**My lifts (In pounds):**

* Squat (3x5): 85 -&gt; 270
* Deadlift (1x5): 145 -&gt; 295
* Bench (3x5): 85 -&gt; 165
* Press (3x5) 65 -&gt; 115

**My Diet:**

Not very strict at first. Didn't eat unhealthily but didn't count macros. Got my about 170g of protein in per day and ate a little more on lift days but that's it.

Generally my diet looked something like this:

Breakfast

* Oatmeal and raisins
* Glass of milk
* Protein Shake

Lunch

* Ham Sandwich on multigrain bread, and two slices of kraft singles
* Snack Bar (200 calories, pretty much no other nutrition)
* Apple
* Almonds throughout the day

Dinner

* Large Chicken Breast 
* 200 grams of peas
* Half a can of mushroom soup
* Glass of milk
* Protein Shake

The weekends were less structured. I tried to keep them in check but I ate out and drank more than I probably should have

**Routine:**

Stronglifts 5x5 and then progressed into doing stronglifts with 3x5 about 3 months in. I stopped doing Rows for some reason about that time as well but I've started them again.

I've added some accessory work over the last two months. Mainly Curls, Chin Ups, Planks, Ab Wheel, Dips, Shrugs, Dumbell Flys, Lat Raises. I group them so I do 2 or 3 at the end of the Monday/Wednesday/Friday workouts.

I also bike a lot. It's not on any set routine. Sometimes I wouldn't bike at all during the week and other times I'd bike to work every day. 

**Going forward:**

I definitely need to work on my bench and overhead press in terms of lift numbers. Aesthetically I'd like to mainly focus on my lacking chest, and lats. I'm going to milk my linear gains for a little while longer then switch to an intermediate program I think.

**Thanks**

Thanks everyone on this subreddit for completely redefining what I thought a reasonable goal even was! You guys are great. It was posts like this that inspired me in the first place, so hopefully someone out there gains something from this. 

The one thing I have learned is that I could have probably made a lot more progress if I was more strict with my diet and routine. Work caused me to have to take multiple weeks off in a row and sometimes I was lazy and didn't put in the effort I should have. You definitely get out what you put in, and I still have a long way to go ahead of me.

**Edit:** So I said that I'd add a leg shot. There's no full length mirror in my hotel but here is one from a couple weeks ago. It wasn't originally meant to show anything off so bare with me.

I am far, far from being the buffest guy at the gym, but I am at least getting some respect now since I was a lot doughier before and it is showing lately.  

Anyways, I usually bring some food to snack on the way out of the locker room like some turkey cold cuts and fruit for a post workout meal.  The other day the fridge was bare, so I grabbed some greek yogurt.  It wasn't in an individual container, so I had to scoop it with a measuring cup.  I took one cup, said fuck it; and wrapped the entire  measuring cup with Saran wrap and put it in my insulated lunch bag with a spoon.  

After my workout, I unwrapped it and ate it right out of the measuring cup with my spoon at my locker after a brutal workout.  Some guy comes up to me and asks me ""are you eating Crisco?"".  I looked at it, and realized it did look like it-- so I told him, ""yeah, it is a really great way to get some post workout calories really quickly to your muscles-- nothing better.  Beats a protein drink any day.""  I thought I was laying the sarcasm on pretty heavy and we had a laugh.

Anyways, totally forgot about it-- then today I was getting changed and heard some guy coughing.  I looked over and say this dude with a measuring cup, a spoon, and a tub of Crisco in his locker.  He looked over at me, and said ""Man, I don't know how you eat this stuff so quickly.  I've been working on this for 20 minutes and only got half down.  Yesterday it took me an hour.""  I didn't know what to say; I was half laughing and half felt bad.  I told him it got easier after a week or so; but now I am regretting that decision and I feel bad.

Photography by David Ford July 18th 2012 [Album](http://imgur.com/a/GFoJt#0)

Height: 5’9.5”

Age: 24
Starting Weight March 5th 2012: 185lbs

Day before the Photo shoot July 17th 2012: 150 lbs

Skin fold Measurements July 17th 2012 (in mm):

		Triceps – 3.6
		Abdominal – 7
		Subscapular – 7
		Thigh – 7.2
		Chest – 2.2
		Calf – 4.1
		Maxillary - 4.2
		Bicep – 2.2
		Lower Back – 6.4
		Suprailiac – 3.7 
		Parrillo Caliper Method – 7.8% Body Fat

Diet: 

I have tried two approaches in dieting, a cyclical ketogenic diet (CKD) and a clean eating style of diet. When I was on the CKD diet I lost a tremendous amount of body fat but I also lost a ton of muscle. A clean style diet was a better approach for me this year and it spared nearly all of my muscle.
 
I ate 1.2 g/lb of protein and gradually increased to 1.5 g/lb as I crept closer to my goal. I kept my fat at 20% and carbohydrates made up the remaining calories. My calories were kept at 14 calories/lb and I ate 6 times a day.

For major protein sources I consumed chicken breast, egg whites, cottage cheese and protein powder. For carbohydrates I had oatmeal, brown rice, and fruit (mostly bananas). My fat sources were almonds and natural peanut butter. My vegetable consumption was not limited so I was to able to eat as much as I wanted.

I had hot sauce and mustard for condiments. No ketchup the entire time. No refined carbohydrates! However, I did allow myself to have diet pop and one cheat meal per week.

Three weeks out from my photo shoot I stopped having cheat meals. Two weeks out I started to gradually increase my water consumption to 7-8L per day. 7 Days out I stopped having all spices (salt, pepper, and condiments). I did a three day carbohydrate depletion followed by a 3 day carbohydrate load and gradually decreased my water to almost nothing (0.5L day before).

Supplements: 

Pre Workout – EC Stack (Ephedrine 24mg, Caffeine 200mg – only on lifting days), Arginine, Taurine, Beta-Alanine.

Post Workout – 2 scoops protein (approx 50g protein), Beta-Alanine, Creatine Monohydrate, 1 or 2 bananas.

Water Drop – PVL Watertight for 10 days.


Training: 

Day 1 – Chest/Tri

Day 2 – Back/Bi/Core

Day 3 – Quads/Hamstrings

Day 4 – Shoulders

Day 5 – Full Body Recovery/Core

Day 6 – Cardio (7 km outdoor run or elliptical/bike for 45mins)

Day 7 – Rest

Conclusion: Overall I'm extremely happy with the results and I finally have the confidence now to do a competition!

**Edit1: Working through the comments everybody and answering questions. I'm trying to make the best responses possible. Ask Away!**

**Edit2**: Ab Routine: 2 cycles, no rest between exercises.

*High incline ab crunch with weight behind head x15

*High incline leg raise and lift bum, lower back, off the pad straight up at the top of the lift x15

*Oblique crunch on oblique bench with weight x15 on each side

*Ab Roller x 15

*Side to side oblique crunch with legs up with weight x25

Really hard to describe the names

**Edit3**: Water Drop/Carb Depletion:

The idea with the depletion is to deplete your body of its glycogen stores both in the liver and muscle. I did this for 3 days, and i had no carbohydrates in my diet. You train in the higher rep range with less rest between sets to burn off all the glycogen stores in your body.

By doing this you create an environment where your body is basically starving for carbs. When you carb load (approximately 50% more carbs then usual) your body responds by super saturating the muscles with glycogen therefore making you look harder and fuller. You also drop your water intake at this time to promote water flowing into your muscle with the glycogen and releasing the water from under your skin.

so 3 weeks out increase water to 6-8L.

6 days out - carb depletion, normal water 

5 days out - carb depletion, 10L water 

4 days out - carb depletion, 8L water 

3 days out - carb load, 6L water 

2 days out - carb load, 2L water 

1 days out - carb load, 0.5L water 

day of photoshoot- no water

The water cycling is to trick your body to drop your water from under your skin to make you tight and ripped. I also took a diuretic to lose as much water as possible.

**Edit4**
Sample Day 1 sets x reps

BB Bench Press 5x8 or 5x5

DB Incline Bench Press 4-5x6-8

Incline DB Fly 3x10

Flat DB Fly 3x10

Cable Rope Tri Extension 5x8

Cable Single Arm Tri Extension or Cable Rope Overhead Tri Extension (Cable French Press)  3x8-10

I workout approximately 90 mins on lifting days.

Switch up the exercises or rep ranges once and while  (at least every 8 weeks) for periodization. 


**Edit5 Added new images to the album!** 

**Edit6** Sample Meals

my breakfast shake is delicious and easy. 1 scoop vanilla protein, liquid egg whites (1/2 cup) and coffee. Gives a specialty coffee place a run for its money. Plus i had a half cup of plain oatmeal.


Also my dinner was 150 grams of chicken, 2/3 cup of rice, veggies, and 1/2 cup of cottage cheese. throw some mustard in there and hot sauce. Microwave. The liquid in the cottage cheese makes a nice sauce!


Homemade granola was my snack. 1/3 cup of raisins, 1/2 cup toasted oats (homemade in a frying pan) and like 20 almonds. Delicious. 

**I find simple foods are generally the healthiest like, oatmeal, fruits, rice, almonds. Little or no cooking involved and they will nourish your body. Don't spend too much time making complicated food because it will become a chore and monotonous. Make it easy to eat so that its harder to cheat.**

**Edit 7** THE EC STACK
This is taken directly from an essay I wrote last semester:

Ephedra/Ephedrine: “Ephedra increases the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine [which] stimulates [the] α- and β- andrenergic receptors” (Manore, 2012, p. 3).The effects are similar to caffeine as ephedra increases thermogenesis, heart rate, and alertness (Manore, 2012, p. 4). It also has some appetite suppressing qualities. When taking both ephedra and caffeine together they work synergistically to promote increased fat oxidization then taking them separately (Manore, 2012, p. 5). “Two double-blind RCTs lasting 6-9 months reported greater weight loss (~3-5kg) and fat loss (~1.5-4.3kg) with ephedrine alkaloids (40-90mg/day) and caffeine (100-192mg/day) versus a placebo in overweight or obese individuals” (Manore, 2012, p. 5).

**Edit8** Full Body Recovery

Super Set 1: No break between exercises, 10 reps per exercise, 3 cycles, 90-120 sec rest

* DB Row

* Air Squat

* DB Bench Press


Super Set 2: No break between exercises, 10 reps per exercise, 3 cycles, 90-120 sec rest

* BB Military Press (press from front then press from back = 1 rep)

* BB Squat (I use same weight from military press)

* Pull Ups or Chin Ups if you can (lat pull down if not)


Super Set 3: No break between exercises, 12 reps per exercise, 3 cycles, 90-120 sec rest

* Rope Tri Extension

* DB Standing Bicep Curl (strict, no cheating!)

* DB Side Raise

Then finish with some core work!

Notes: Choose weight that will only give a minimal burn (if at all). This workout is designed to give a pump and blood flow to all the muscle groups in your body to promote recovery. This is NOT a muscle building routine. Enjoy this workout it is supposed to be fun and give you a great pump!

1352897789.0,759,self.Fitness,136g31,"Shoulder stability and rotator cuff exercises for prevention, treatment of shoulder pain and a solid foundation for pressing",999,240,178,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/136g31/shoulder_stability_and_rotator_cuff_exercises_for/,"There is a high incidence of rotator cuff tendonitis among lifters and athletes. The most common cause of shoulder pain and injuries are rotator cuff disorders. Also on fittit a few times weekly a post pops up about rotator cuff related shoulder pain.   
A deeper look at the risk factors that contribute to the development of rotator cuff tendinopathy explains why specific exercises play a crucial role in the treatment and prevention. Prevention is the most effective treatment. I will also discuss how these preventive shoulder stability exercises enhance shoulder function and provide a strong foundation to build a powerful press.   


Risk factors    

The risk factors that contribute to the development of a rotator cuff tendon injury are both overuse (regular overhead lifting; shoulder impingement) and underuse (tendon degeneration).    
   
1.	Excessive overhead lifting and overhead sports are important factors contributing to rotator cuff issues. There is a difference in fibre cross-sectional area between the different layers of the supraspinatus tendon (Nakajima, et al. 1994). The tendon fibres closer to the shoulder joint have a smaller cross-sectional area and hence are less able to withstand strain (Lohr, et al. 1990). These fibres are strained the most during higher angles of arm abduction (Reilley et al. 2003).      
2.	Impingement: Before attaching to the head of the humerus the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles pass underneath a bony roof (the acromion, which is a part of the shoulder blade). This subacromial space is a confined space that even narrows when the shoulder is abducted or flexed (Thompson MD, 2010). During forward flexion or abduction of the shoulder, the supraspinatus tendon can get compressed against the acromion, leading to degeneration of the tendon and tendonitis (Luo et al. 1998).      
3.	Underuse: The supraspinatus tendon is prone to degenerative changes. The supraspinatus tendon is poorly vascularized (Rathbun, et al. 1970). Poor blood-circulation can alter the tendon remodelling process (constant degradation and rebuilding of tendon tissue) and contributes to tendon degeneration in people with a less active lifestyle (Lo et al. 2004). Especially the tendon fibres that receive the most strain when lifting overhead have poor vascularity (Rathburn et al. 1970). A degenerated tendon is more susceptible to tendinopathy, partial and complete tears.    


Treatment    

The mainstays of treatment include rest, anti-inflammatory medication and treatment. Research shows however that these conservative treatments can provide pain relief in the short term, but have NO success in the long term (Koester et al. 2007).    
There are two problems with this traditional treatment approach. 
         
1.	Several studies demonstrate little or no inflammation is actually present in tendons exposed to overuse (Kahn et al. 1999, Soslowsky et al. 2000).     
2.	The changes that occur in tendons in response to overuse are degeneration due to an altered tendon remodelling process (constant degradation and rebuilding of tendon tissue) and disorganization of collagen fibres (Kahn et al. 1999, Soslowsky et al. 2000). The net result is degeneration and weakness of the tendon and pain.     
3.	Because of the poor blood circulation of the supraspinatus tendon and low metabolic activity of the tendon cells it will take forever for the tendon to heal while resting. Inactivity will also cause the tendon to further degenerate. 

Treatment for rotator cuff disorders should always consist of rotator cuff strengthening exercises and exercises to enhance scapulothoracic stability. Research shows that these exercises are effective to reduce pain and strengthen and recondition the rotator cuff tendons.  Exercise increases blood circulation in the tendons of the muscles that are exercised, the metabolic activity of the tenocytes (tendon cells), the release of local growth factors and collagen synthesis (Kjaer et al. 2006, Kjaer et al. 2000, Langberg et al. 1998).     
Rotator cuff exercises will also improve shoulder function and prevent rotator cuff impingement. A strong rotator cuff widens the subacromial space during shoulder flexion and abduction and prevents rub of the rotator cuff tendons against the acromion (Thompson 2010).           


Train the shoulder as a unit    

The shoulder complex consists off two joints: the scapulathoracic joint (joint formed by ribcage and shoulder blade) and the glenohumeral joint (joint formed by shoulder blade and upper arm).     
To effectively stabilise the shoulder, the rotator cuff muscles need to operate from a stable scapular base.    
Good balance and proper activation of the scapular muscles will result in proper scapular motion during the vertical or horizontal press. Proper scapular mechanics enable the rotator cuff muscles to contract close to their ideal length, so they can effectively stabilise the glenohumeral joint with maximal force. When the scapular stabilisers and rotator cuff do their job there’s minimal slippage of the humeral head in the glenoid fossa of the scapula during the press (Cools et al. 2003). Good arthrokinematics causes less stress on the shoulder membrane and form a strong foundation for pressing.

Shoulder instability and concurrent rotator cuff tendonitis or tears are often related to a loss of function of the scapulathoracic joint. A common imbalance in people that often lift overhead is a strong upper part of the trapezius, compared to a weaker middle and lower part of the trapezius (Cools et al. 2003).
The upper part of the trapezius is, due to its postural role, highly active in upper body exercises or movements executed while standing or seated. Especially overhead movements in an upright position and exercises for the deltoid muscles (big shoulder muscle) highly activate the upper part of the trapezius with little contraction of the lower and middle part (Ludewig et al. 1996). This explains why rotator cuff exercises that highly activate the deltoid muscles and upper part of the trapezius (lateral raise, Cuban press) are not effective and are likely causing the issues they are trying to fix.      

       
Shoulder stability routine for treatment and prevention    

A shoulder stability routine for the acute phase of rotator cuff related shoulder pain:        

1. [Side-lying external shoulder rotation](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/side-lying-external-shoulder-rotation) 3 x 15 reps@ (@ means each side)     
2. [Dumbbell reverse flies]( http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/dumbbell-reverse-flies) 3 x 15 reps        

These exercises primarily focus on the subscapularis, infraspinatus and teres minor muscles, without too much activation of the supraspinatus muscles. Even in the acute phase, it should be possible to carry out these exercises without pain.   
These exercises also promote lower and middle trapezius activation with minimal activity in the upper trapezius, which will improve scapular motion and stability.   

A shoulder stability routine for the sub-acute phase or for prevention:   
     
1. [Row-external rotation-press]( http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/row-external-rotation-press) 3 x 15 reps@ (@ means each side)      
2. [YMCA](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/ymca-on-stability-ball)  3 x 8-14 reps (add 2 reps/week, when you reach 14 reps, return to 8 reps, but add 1-2 lbs.)     
3. [Horizontal shoulder abduction](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/horizontal-shoulder-abduction)   2 x 15-20 reps@      
4. [Inverse row](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/inverse-row) 3 x 10 reps + 1 set to failure     

These shoulder stability routines you can add to your workout. Focus in the beginning a lot on horizontal pull exercises and shoulder stability exercises.     
Once you go back to lifting normal, keep focusing on a balance in sets between horizontal puling and pressing and between overhead pressing and vertical pulling exercises. An overemphasis of upper body pressing strength leads to bad posture and injury-prone shoulders.    
A good alternative for bench press are push-ups. Push-ups promote the co-contraction of the rotator cuff musculature. Push-ups also activate the serratus anterior muscle more compared to the bench press. Because the scapula is not supported by the bench during the push-up, a stronger contraction is required from the serratus anterior to prevent the scapula from winging. Some push-ups in addition to bench press and its variations add variety to your workout. The [elastic band push-up](http://functionalresistancetraining.com/exercises/elastic-band-push-up) is a push-up that enhances co-contration even more.

1333647002.0,758,self.Fitness,ruwj8,Let's clear up this caffeine + creatine bro-science.,962,204,147,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ruwj8/lets_clear_up_this_caffeine_creatine_broscience/,"Almost every day I see someone spout out something along the lines of: ""You can take creatine and caffeine as long as it's not the same time!"" This misinformation is even on the usually factual [examine.com](http://examine.com/faq/does-caffeine-counteract-creatine.html): ""Caffeine can counteract creatine when coingested at the same time.""

Let’s make something clear, there is absolutely no scientific evidence to back this up. 

All of this brouhaha (or rather, bro-haha) about caffeine counteracting creatine stems from a single study: [“Caffeine counteracts the ergogenic action of muscle creatine loading.”]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8929583) It is cited above by examine in support of the timing/co-ingestion conjecture.

Let’s actually read the damn thing, eh? In the following quotes, protocol A refers to the creatine group, protocol C refers to the creatine + caffeine group (protocol B was the control group).

""During protocol A the subjects were administered creatine supplements for 6 days (days 2-7). They ingested a total of 0.5 g creatine monoydrate per kilogram body weight per day, divided over eight similar doses taken at regular intervals."" 

“Protocol C was similar to protocol A. However, on days 5, 6, and 7, in addition to the creatine supplements, the subjects were administered a **single dose** of 5mg caffeine x kg body wt x day. Caffeine capsules were ingested after breakfast.""

Is the timing of co-ingesting caffeine and creatine counteracting the effects of creatine an interesting hypothesis based on this study? Ehh, maybe. Do the methods of this study support this hypothesis? *Absolutely not, it couldn’t be clearer*.

So what does this study actually find?

- At the end of the six days, *both the creatine and creatine+caffeine group had similarely elevated muscle PCr and ATP concentration* compared to the control group, which are thought to be responsible for the ergogenic (meaning performance-enhancing) effects of creatine.

- Despite this, only the creatine group showed increased performance in knee-torque extension.

Quite frankly, I am not at all thrilled that this singular study is responsible for the whole creatine &amp; caffeine controversy for several reasons:

-	Only looks at one 6 day loading period
-	They conclude that their study “demonstrates creatine loading to increase PCr concentration in skeletal muscle. This is accompanied by accelerated recovery of muscle contractile capacity during the rest episodes of high-intensity intermittent exercise. The ergogenic action of creatine loading is counteracted by caffeine.” *But then who was muscle PCr?!?!*
-	The study only focuses on one exercise
-	The sample size is **nine dudes**, meaning **three guys per control group**
-	It’s one fucking study

I think it certainly prompts a lot of questions, but it really doesn't answer any interesting ones.

Not sure about anyone else, but for me, I really can't stand someone dumber than me being more fit...it's just...bothersome lol. 
So I started weight training with a goal - to get a six pack. It sounds lame but it worked! 
Beyond that it ended up changing my life...I'm completely in love with weight training now and it's a huge part of my life. I feel great, I'm way more confident, and I seem to meet women everywhere I go...it's awesome.

The routine I used was actually based off of something I read on simplyshredded.com - if you havent been to this site, GO THERE, it seriously changed my life. Soo much useful info. Kind of a wierd routine but it worked.

Wednesday - Kickboxing

Then Thursday would be the same as monday, and Friday the same as tuesday. So I would hit each muscle group twice a week.

Diet - I was strict. For 6 months. That shit was hard. Really hard. I like to eat anything and everything. But i basically stayed away from bread, and any carb that was white unless it was right before or after a workout. I would wake up with either oatmeal and fruit, or a protien shake with fruit. Workout, then have a protien shake again. Then eggs and veggies and brown rice. Then more protien shakes and cottage cheese. For cheat days I'd have sushi.

Hope that answers some questions. Oh and also, yeah my backyard is pretty sweet, but I only workout back there in the summer time :)

**EDIT** I should add that I play the drums too, which doesnt build muscle but burns a lot of calories. Its what I do for a living so I'm at the drumset like 30+ hours a week. Here's a video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_PaUDO8VTo&amp;feature=g-all-u

The big update that we’ve been working towards for the past 6 months or so.

[The blog post goes into details](http://examine.com/blog/weve-solved-supplement-confusion/), but basically we’ve moved away from just a statistical-significance database of human trials and introduced clinical significance for each supplement and their associated effects (and the magnitude of the effects). If you want to know if Supplement X does Y ... well you only need to look it up in our Human Effect Matrix.

(Turns out a lot of people are threatened by the full summary when there aren't blue quote boxes; go figure... adding text to the matrix does a lot in consolidating information)

There is a bit of subjectiveness to it - minor vs notable vs strong is not easily quantified, but we’ve tried to identify it based on feel - would you notice the effect? And how strong would that effect be? The **strong** rating is mostly reserved for pharma-grade effects (fish oil and triglycerides, berberine and fasting glucose) while the minor effect is for stuff that technically occur but are probably not significant in any way; the notable is a bridge between the two, an effect that is worth looking into but is not pharma-grade (for example, if supplement A has an antidepressant effect but despite being better than placebo and probably relevant it still performs less than valium as a reference compound).

I’m normally not one to pander, but this is a big update for us. Sharing this on the facebooks or tweeting about it will be more than lovely.

**Major supplemental Update: Fish Oil**

[Direct Link](http://examine.com/supplements/Fish+Oil/). I'm not really show how to approach this but I'll give it a go anywho; a wholly accurate Tl;Dr is impossibly difficult, and despite 712 citations this page still has a lot of holes in it.

- The omega-3 to omega-6 ratio is probably the ultimate deciding factor in the benefits of fish oil (excluding triglyceride reduction to be discussed). However, *why* this is important is discussed in the eicosanoid section. Both classes of fatty acids are stored in a cell membrane, and they are liberated into their potent derivatives (eicosanoids, but they sort of work like hormones); the enzyme that releases them does not discriminate between either of them, so it will release whatever is stored and then the omega-3 eicosanoids do their thing (usually antiinflammatory and antioxidative) while the omega-6 stuff do their things (usually immunosupportive and inflammatory)

- The whole 'immunosuppressive' thing is somewhat unreliable, and it may be that when you are deficient in omega-3 fatty acids (relative to omega-6) the higher omega-6 content actually supports your immune system (and thus normalization sort of seems like suppression). The mechanisms are outlined in the immunology section, but basically suppressing IL-2 signalling will suppress T-cell proliferation

- B-cells (important in reacting to infections) seem to actually be supported with fish oil supplementation, and it seems that taking fish oil and exercise reverses immunosuppression into immunosupport. No clue why

- The triglyceride reducing effect of fish oil is highly reliable and highly supported (see the matrix; 100% consensus on 44 studies I think? That is *not* all of them, probably not even half) and is pharmaceutical grade in potency. This is why Lovaza exists

- HDL-C is increased somewhat reliably, and LDL-C is increased somewhat unreliably but overall in meta-analyses it does appear to be a relevant increase. It isn't too bad in healthy people, but it has been noted in some instances to be pretty bad in dyslipidemics so it is a bit worrisome for unhealthy persons taking fish oil. Pairing fish oil with statins (red yeast extract is a nutraceutical source of lovastatin, just get a reliable source) appeared to reverse the increase in LDL-C

- The anti-depressive effects of fish oil are kinda sorta pharma grade (a bit less) *only* in severely depressed persons, with minor depression not having any benefit from fish oil whatsoever. I have no clue why this difference exists, but they appear to play nice with SSRIs based on limited evidence

- There is absolutely no concern with fish oil or any polyunsaturated fat causing lipid peroxidation in my opinion. Aside from DNA damage (the ultimate oxidative result we should be concerned with) not being present in human given fish oil under normal conditions, eicosanoid signalling requires lipid peroxidation and the eicosanoids themselves are hella potent antioxidative and repair molecules (so yeah, hormesis is relevant again). However, it is still theoretically possible you can absolutely superload fish oil and then do a marathon and induce some DNA damage, so don't do that

Overall, my notes on fish oil:

- Normalizing the ratio is likely the most relevant thing to do with fish oil, and this can be achieved by either supplemental fish oil *or* including fish oil in your diet while actively reducing intake of omega-6. Supplementation is not needed for health, a normalized ratio is though

- For those with metabolic syndrome, the combination supplements of fish oil (high EPA), berberine, red yeast extract, and spirulina has potential to be incredibly rehabilitative; if interested, talk to the medical doctor

- For those looking towards cognitive enhancement, high DHA (900mg or so) paired with Uridine (CDP-Choline is interchangeable; not other cholines) and Bacopa Monnieri is highly promising.

**Stats**  
5'11 290lbs - 6'0 183lbs. (I grew an inch!)  
**Diet**  
I simply counted calories, I started with a thousand calorie deficit for the first few months and reduced the extremity of the deficit as I went along gradually. I'm currently still running a 500 calorie deficit as I have about 20lbs roughly before I'm around 12% body fat. (Currently sitting around 19-20%). The biggest part on not giving up with my cut was patience. I lost weight pretty quickly (100lbs in about 9 months) but it still took me a long time to notice differences. The biggest key to trumping that fact was realizing at no matter what weight I was I was happy with my body. Happy but not content. I was just as happy with my face and proud of myself at 250lbs as I am now at 180lbs. I implemented cheat meals every Friday when I would throw down with the bro's and ate what ever I want within reason, as that falls in line with what a lot of people say here. My progress would have been faster if I had not done this but it is not as certain that I would have succeeded if I had not treated myself from time to time. I never punished myself for the days I slipped up as well, I'm human, you're human, we're all human and we make mistakes the key is not scolding yourself every time you make a mistake, and instead improve from the ones you make.  
**Exercise**  
For the first few weeks I began with easy cardio, slow long walks every night with my mother (Who has also lost 60lbs, GO MOM!) and then slowly started taking up more difficult things like running and skipping rope. I started out not being able to jump rope for a minute straight and wanting to vomit after running a quarter of a mile. I have since ran a 30 minute 5k for my local humane shelter. I have sort of laid off the cardio since then though, I just do a mile on all my lift days at varying intensities depending at what I'm ""feeling"". Which brings me to my next subject, LIFTING! Don't skip out on this, I did for a very long time and only since I have begun to lift 'this heavy-ass weight' have I begun to really see vast differences in myself in my body. AND THAT IS WHILE LIFTING ON A DEFICIT AS WELL. Thank the gods for noob gains. I hurt my rotator cuff pushing myself, so my upper body lifts are still pretty meager for 3 months worth of progress, just gotta suck it up and keep grinding! I started with Starting Strength but have since switched to GreySkull LP, because of the longer rest periods between each compound while still utilizing my noob gains.   
**3 months lifting stats**  
Squat 115lbs -- 185lbs  
Deadlift 135lbs -- 255lbs

**Background:**

On June 3rd, 2011 I weighed in at 282 lbs. I'm 5'6, and as you can tell in the before pictures, I was pretty much wider than I was tall. I had always been overweight and thought that I was just always going to be stuck there. However, that morning, when I looked into the mirror I finally saw what was really there. We have a way of sometimes seeing past our physical appearance because we're ashamed and don't want to admit to ourselves that we have let ourselves fall that much. And right then and there, I decided I was done doing this to myself.



**Exercise:**

I started with P90X. I modified exercises as needed, I sweated profusely (and probably destroyed my carpet in the process), but I worked every single day for 90 days and I got through it. I think I lost 40-50 lbs during this period.

After P90X, I started Insanity, which focused more on cardio and high intensity interval training. This took me through to November, where I did a month or two of my own running to end of the year.

Around January first, I started P90X2 since I had great success with the first program, and continued with my weight loss.

I've since graduated from the workout videos, and begun a weightlifting regimen inspired by Starting Strength and r/fitness. I have about 10 more lbs I want to lose before focusing on body re composition with more lifting.


**Diet:**

I've probably done every single type of dieting in the book in the last 10 months, but the one constant has been calorie counting. At the end of the day, it's what you're putting into your body vs what you are consuming for energy. In the beginning I had a 1200-1500 calorie a day diet, which slowly worked itself to around 1000 calories at times.

I've done keto off and on. I've found it's the best diet for suppressing appetite and making it very easy to continue living your life without feeling the stress from food.

I've also done periods of fasting. I add in 1-2 day fasts now every week or two, because it helps me to separate my dependency on food and learn that I can function without food constantly, proving that it is a psychological dependency more than a physical one. It also helps me with my still bad habit of binge eating. Binge eating is my weakness, but I think it's something I'll just have to manage moving forward in my life.

I've also done up to 5 days at a time of Protein Sparing Modified Fasting, which is about in between Keto and straight fasting in terms of how it feels.


**Moving Forward:**

I want to lose another 10 lbs, then start increasing my calories to build some more muscle and work on my lifting. I've learned that losing weight won't cure the problems you have in life, but it sure as hell is a step in the right direction.



**Notable Accomplishments Since Starting to Lose Weight:**

* Walked a half-marathon
* Ran a 5 mile race in under 50 minutes
* Ran a 5k in under 24 minutes


**Lifts (5rm):**

* Bench: 165 lbs
* Squats: 250 lbs
* Overhead Press: 110 lbs
* Deadlifts: 330 lbs
* Chinups/Pullups: 12 non-weighted, 5 with 35 lbs weight


**Planned Events for this Year:**

* 100 mile bike ride
* Tough Mudder
* More 5ks

Just wanted to share with /r/fitness and hopefully this can help some people stay motiviated.  If you put your mind to it, you can do it!


EDIT**

I should probably mention that from March 1st 2012 through October 1st 2012, I went through a cutting phase where I was strictly maintaining (weighed 215lbs with a pretty high body fat and dropped down to 188lbs).  I kept my bench weight at 185 during that whole time.  So from October 1st 2012 until yesterday, my bench went from 185lbs to 225lbs.

Also, I realize that this might not be considered a major achievement by some people's standards.  I'm new to reddit so I'm still learning what is and isn't cool to post.  My first round of bulking (8 months-ish) I was not bulking very clean and wasn't working out with enough intensity, but I still went from benching 95 lbs to almost doubling that and getting to 185lbs.  The next bulk round (last october - present) I got my act together and went from 185 to 225.",,False,,t5_2qhx4,1362169853.0,,,True,t3_19guwx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/19guwx/benched_225lbs_for_the_first_time_yesterday/,

So, 2 years ago, at a weight of 350, I said to myself, 'fuck this shit' and started doing something about it.  I'm 31 now and had been fat pretty much my entire life.  Some pictures:

[And here is a picture of me from 2 years ago, shortly after I had my big epiphany and started losing weight, next to a picture of me from about a month ago](http://i.imgur.com/YOE3E.jpg)

As for some stats, as mentioned already I went from 350 to 200 (more like 205 now, thanks holiday season!), 31 years old, and did it over a period of about 2 years.  I'm 6'5, pants went from size 44 to 32.  Shirt size from 3x to large, and it would probably be medium except they're never long enough.

I did it by eating right and lifting weights.  I did some cardio here and there, and have started to run recently (I did a 5k on Thanksgiving morning!), but only after the majority of the weight was gone.  I was ketogenic low carb for over a year, which is how I lost the majority of the weight.  But low carb is not ideal for putting on muscle, which I'm now ready to do.  Currently doing Leangains which I've had great success with, since starting it my body weight hasn't moved much but I went from size 34 to 32 pants.  Plus, my weights in the gym are no longer stagnant, which they were for the majority of the time I was losing weight.  I still have a long way to go in that area.

did a hundred in 06:53. am now in the lead and proud. it's not an extremly good time, but burpees isn't something I do regulary and I'm beating the guys (19 y/o female). 
non of my friends know what burpees are, so I came here to brag.

anyway. do you like burpees as exercise? do you include them in workouts, concider them a workout or don't do them at all?

**EDIT:** 

* the burpees we did was chest/thighs to floor and up again, clasping hands over head. almost all front of your body lies on the floor before you go back up. if it was not done with (more or less) correct form, it wasn't counted. 

* reading the comments, it seems that its a common rugby-conditioning exercise. I play rugby. gotta be a link there...

This is from me when I was 15 to present day (21). http://i.imgur.com/Y5FEKbd.jpg

EDIT: So people have been wondering what my diet/lifting regime was for the last 3 years. I'll be honest and say that a lot has changed since I first started, learning new things on the way. I lost all the weight just from doing cardio and watching calorie intake, keeping my carb intake on off days to a minimum (&lt;100 Grams). I was down to 150 at that point. I then decided i wanted to get BIG and ate 6-7 decently sized meals a day, eating complex carbs and protein with almost every meal. This is me at 203 last year, the highest I ever weighed (but wasnt lean at all). http://i.imgur.com/dMx70lS.jpg

 The one thing i can stress to those who are wanting to put on mass is compound movements. The 4 main ones I focused on were: squatting, dead lifting, benching, and power cleaning. Even if you'd like to lose weight, compound movements I've found really help burn calories in a shorter amount of time.

Does the computer guy from [this](http://i.imgur.com/E7FIp.jpg) pic look like you? If so, you have a lot of work to do to look like the Greek god you’re supposed to be. Let’s look at ideal posture for a minute. Look at your profile in the mirror. Chances are you’re gonna find that your head is jutting forward, or that your shoulders are slumped forward coupled with a hunchback posture, or that your lower back is so arched that your stomach protrudes forward, giving you the “skinny gut”. People are under the mistaken impression that working out hard in the gym will fix this. Let’s make one thing clear - what you do in the gym only cements what you have. If you have bad posture, heavy lifting makes it worse. If you have good posture, heavy lifting makes it better. Of course there are exceptions to this, but for the majority of the population, that’s the norm. 

This post is about anterior pelvic tilt, the most common posture dysfunction. I will address posterior pelvic tilt in another post. How do you know if you have an anterior pelvic tilt? Look at your belt. If you belt points towards the floor, you have an anterior pelvic tilt. Or, look sideways in the mirror. does your butt stick out? Chances are that you have an anterior pelvic tilt.
I’m gonna break bad posture in 2 sections, lower body and upper body. The lower body influences the upper body, but upper body doesn’t always influence the lower body.


Lower body:

The classic bad guys in APT are tight hip flexors coupled with a tight rectus femoris (quads) and lumbar erectors (lower back). The weakened muscles are the glute max, hamstrings and the abs (mostly the rectus abdominus and external obliques). Most people think that the hamstrings are tight in this position and stretch the heck out of them, but the hamstrings are actually in a lengthened state – stretching them will only make it worse. Due to antagonist dominance, the glute max will not fire to its maximum capacity and to pick up for this slack, the adductor magnus and the hamstrings will be forced to step in. this leads to hamstring pulls and groin pulls. Have you ever heard of an athlete suffering from glute pulls?

Fixing this dysfunction takes some work:

1) Lengthen the hip flexors.  The [lunge stretch](http://i.imgur.com/L6OUQ.jpg) works best. Make sure that you’re moving at the hips and not the lower back. Squeeze the heck out of your butt of the leg that’s behind you. To enhance this stretch, raise the hand of the stretched hip to the ceiling. If you can't ""feel"" your butt contracting, try tapping it with your fingers or squeezing it.

2) Activate and strengthen the glutes. According to Bret Contreras ,the [quadruped hip extension](http://i.imgur.com/mAHMa.jpg) gives the most activity in the glute max. I find that to be consistent with my experience. [Glute bridges](http://i.imgur.com/VqWRB.jpg) are also a good movement to relearn the hip extension pattern, but it’s advanced and very easy to get wrong.

3) Do NOT stretch the back via traditional flexion stretches like the toe touch stretch. Although it is a decent lumbar stretch, it puts a lot of pressure on the spinal discs and can make a bad back worse. The [cat and camel stretches](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXRsjICsGnc) are the best biomechanical stretches for the lower back. Don't force the stretch, let your back get accustomed to it.

4) Strengthen the abs. Please do not do crunches. I cannot stress that enough. They work well, but like the toe touch stretch, it’s not worth it when there are so many other better exercises out there.  Some fine exercises for beginners are the bird-dog and the plank. Once you can hold a plank for 60 seconds, go on to more advanced variations. Let me make one thing clear with the plank. Your posture should be perfect and your knees should have a very slight bend in them.  You abs should be tight with a slight arch in the lower back and the butt should be squeezed. Imagine you have a coin between your cheeks and it should not drop. Squeeze the butt hard and that’s 50% of your problems solved right there. I cannot stress the importance of torso stability enough.



Other than these steps, some important things to do are stretching your calves a lot, and [foam rolling the IT band](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoHBDim_fzk), [outer hips](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWfnAUsYUTI&amp;feature=player_embedded)  and quads, along with the calves and peroneals.


A good warmup before a workout for lengthening and activating muscles would include:

1) Hip flexor stretching coupled with quadruped hip extensions and hip circles – 2x20 seconds of the lunge stretch followed by [this](http://www.youtube.com/user/PerformanceU#p/search/17/wH5inK4WKXo).

2) Foam rolling of the IT band followed by [clams](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvxR5LoOu8Y)

3) 3x3 [hand walkouts](http://chadwaterbury.com/core-hand-walkout/)

4) A lot of people forget that one of the main functions of the glutes is to eccentrically stop the femur from internally rotating. This exercise (and most single leg exercises) work well to fix that. Don't let the knee cave in, keep it over the toes at all times. Add 6 reps on each leg of this exercise: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7DBEjqNo8Y


this is a pretty good solution to a very common problem. it's pretty simplistic in it's approach. here are some links that may interest some people:

Before - I was a 13.5 stone student bum! Boozing and eating pretty much whatever I wanted, whilst training chest and biceps about 5 times a week!
http://imgur.com/KkkDK

After - Two years later, following a sensible diet and sensible lifting routine, here's where I am at today

Hopefully provide a bit of inspiration to fellow lifters and people dieting/training hard for summer! I am starting a fitness blog also so if you are interested in that PM me!

I'd be happy to answer any questions on diet/routine for people new to the game and maybe advice on fitting it in with a busy working schedule (i work the standard office 9-5)

Happy lifting guys, and thanks for stopping by 

**EDIT:** 

Yikes guys sorry I didn't realise the detail I was supposed to provide when writing a post like this! I apologise! Thanks cleti for pointing this out!

To answer questions:
1)What routine/s did you follow? 
I have pretty much kept to the same routine throughout my 2 years of lifting, its a 4 day split that I work off.

I change the exercises and weight regularly, I normally do a few weeks real heavy and a few weeks light. Here's an example week for me at the moment

**Monday**: Chest + Biceps (biceps have plenty of energy to be hit hard after chest)

I will do exercises such as flat bench press, incline dumbbell press, flat flyes and normally finish with a pec deck.

My bicep routine consists of straight bar curls and then some kind of isolation movement (normally preacher curls, cable work etc.)

**Tuesday**: Legs

I like to do my quads and hamstrings on the same day, just something mentally satisfying about not having to go through a leg session for another week!

I ALWAYS start with squats, and ALWAYS try and go as heavy as possible for me. I have always seen these as my weak point so I always work hard on these to try and improve.

After squats I move on to really heavy leg press for about 15 or so reps, I usually fail about that point and my wheels start to burn pretty bad.

After this it will be leg extensions, these are pretty instinctive, sometimes i'll go heavy sometimes I will go light and use more volume.

Then I will begin my hamstring workout, consisting of stiff leg deadlifts, leg curls and lunges (yeah its not strictly hamstrings but it finishes me off!)

**Wednesday** I will either rest or do cardio, depending on how i feel!

**Thursday**: Shoulders and triceps. I like to start with heavy barbell/dumbbell shoulder press, as many reps as I can manage on each set.

I will then do lateral raises pretty instinctively, again some days I will go heavy and some days I will go light for more reps, really fills the delts up with blood!
After my laterals I always throw in front raises for 2 sets and remain seated through these before moving onto triceps.

I always use dips in my tricep routine, normally hanging a dumbbell off my waist to provide resistance. I then move onto some kind of extension movement, be it on the cables or skull crushers!

**Friday**: Back. I always begin back with heavy deadlifts, I normally do about four sets of these before putting in some pullups, then I will move onto seated rows and try and finish with dumbbell rows.


**2)**Define ""sensible"" diet. Plenty of diets are sensible and work. What did you follow?
I'm ashamed to say it, and I wasted a lot of time doing this, but my first year was pretty much eating whatever I wanted, when I wanted. I went from about 13.5 stone to 16 stone doing this but got really really fat! The good news is, with my gain in weight I gained strength also so eventually when i tightened up my diet I was able to strip fat and reveal the muscle underneath!

I try and hit around 4000 cals a day, I honestly don't have a set meal plan, I cook different foods each day but my primary protein source comes from fish and beef, where-as my carbohydrates are mainly from sweet potatos. I have one meal of brown rice a day but i get really really bored of it! I try to eat green vegetables where possible but sometimes I don't have time to steam these before work.....


**3)**Starting and ending height, weight and body fat percentage if you know it.

Ok I started at about 13.5 stone and was 6'2, I remember I measured my arms when I started and they were peaking at about 13 inches, it was pretty awesome.

Now i'm at 15.5 stone, I'm the same height. My arms are 17.5"", my waist is 33"", I have 27.5"" quads and my chest is about 45"" i think....and I can't measure round my shoulders myself! I'll get a friend to do it later....


 **4)** Starting and ending lifting stats. What numbers are you putting up in common lifts (squat, bench, press, deadlift, chin ups, power cleans, rows, curls, etc)?

Ok I don't ever do 1 rep max lifts, I don't want to get injured and i'm a bodybuilder, not a power lifter so this doesn't concern me. I try and progressively improve all my compound lifts week in week out....

On the flat bench press I normally work at about 120kg for 8-10 reps, maybe adding 2.5kg each set if I am feeling strong. 

Squats I am working at about 140kg for about 15 reps

Deadlifts - I love these, I have gone up to 220kg on these before for 6 reps, but at the moment I am working with slightly higher reps so I am sticking to about 180kg for 10/12 reps.

I have never done power cleans, and barbell rows I am working at about 100kg for 15 reps.

Hopefully this has given you a little outline of my style of training and dieting, It's pretty instinctive and I honestly believe with bodybuilding you have to find what works for you!

**EDIT NUMBER TWO READ THIS:** Wow, went to bed and there's LOADS of comments on this now! Wasn't really expecting that, there's been some really great compliments so thanks for all the nice comments.

I have received a number of PMs regarding exact diet so I thought I'd give a kind of outline of what I'm eating day to day at the moment to help anyone out. Take this with a pinch of salt as sometimes I throw in or take out an extra bit of steak/carbs/chicken here depending on what is in the fridge

Hi mate, sorry I have been slow in replying loads of people have been PMing me about diet and stuff!

So for breakfast I will have about 150g of Oat Bran with 330ml liquid egg whites from MyProtein, they cook mega quickly in the microwave and are a good protein source. I normally throw a tablespoon of peanut butter in with my oatbran too.

Meal 1 i will eat two hours later, and this consists of 2.5 cans of Tuna (i just buy the tuna steak cans from tesco value) and i have 3 sweet potatoes with this.

Meal 2 I have two hours after that, normally on my lunch break at work so I have a big portion of steak(i buy whole sirloins and cut them myself into wedges!) and 3 sweet potatoes with that and vegetables

Meal 3 I will have two hours after this, I have 3 chicken breasts and 150g of brown rice 

Meal 4 I will have pre-workout two hours later, this is always a Pure whey protein shake with about 60g of blueberries (i read it can increase the blood flow during a workout and provide better pumps) And 3 tabs of MyProtein Thermopure

Meal 5 - This will be postworkout shake. I use 3 scoops of pure whey protein and 1.5 scoops of dextrose. Take all my vitamins/glucosamine/codliver oil/HMB/BCAAs/L-arginine straight after a workout.

Meal 6 - I count this as a meal, I normally eat it about an hour and a half after my shake, I begin to cook it when I start feeling hungry. This is pretty much always about 400g of salmon Fillet and lots of green vegetables.

Meal 7 - two hours later I will eat about 400g of tesco cottage cheese and two generous tablespoons of peanut butter.

I pretty much rinse and repeat this for workout days, on none workout days I don't do stuff like weigh out my carbs, I normally just eat depending on how hungry my body feels. I ALWAYS have a cheat meal once a week. I love Pizza so it's normally this. Or ice cream - Ben and Jerries Phish Food. OM NOM!

**More Progress Pics:**
I got a few PMs asking about more progress pics too so thought I'd put them on here so you guys can see whats going on. I've had to trawl through some awful photos for these so take a look......


So here is another picture of 'before' where I was out partying all the time, boozing every night etc.
http://imgur.com/N2oik

Here is a picture after spending about 8 months eating pretty much whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted.(this was the fattest I've ever been so I never had much photos of these, my body was bigger and I liked my arms, but I was smooth and lacked definition)
http://imgur.com/66r2L

I like this photo because it was taken a few days after I really began paying attention to my diet and I began to take a shape I liked (slim waist, rounder delts, arms getting a little more dense)
http://imgur.com/A3GsG

And here is one taken at the gym not too long after that when I had a pump on. I remember this stage because people would start to comment on my physique (I can't remember exact dates!)
http://imgur.com/mp2gq

And here is quite an arty one taken off my friends blog, he took this about a month ago (i'm the one in the middle) for a uni project he is doing on his photography course.

Hopefully these will give you some more insight into the steps this transformation has taken!

**Final word on steroids:** I knew a lot of people would instantly assume steroid usage - thats fine, everyone is entitled to an opinion. There are a few points about my post I would like you to consider though, before you go pointing the finger.

* My father was a bodybuilder and competed in a national competiton - NEVER underestimate genetic ability to gain/lose weight in bodybuilding. I am lucky and can pretty much eat whatever I want whilst maintaining a lean, hard physique.

* These pictures are the two most EXTREME before and after photos I could find. The lighting on the recent one is good, and I was really pumped after a session pretty much all over my body!

* My diet is flat out consistent. I drink probably once every two months, I don't smoke, I eat the same foods day in/day out and bust my ass in the gym about an hour and a half/two hours every evening after working a 9 hour shift at work, and I normally do cardio after weights at the moment too. I 100% attribute my physiques progress to keeping a consistent diet, consistant routine and sticking with it, and making TINY adjustments to change certain areas.  Sleep is also real important, I try and get about 8 hours a night every night.

Hope this sheds some light on my situation. I do have a video fitness blog with diet advice/training on it, if anyone is interested PM me and i'll send you the channel or something.

**TL:DR - ** Transformed my body in two years, worked my damn ass off for it and I'm proud of it

Late last year we released our algorithmically tailored workout engine to fittit, and the community here has been the single biggest driver of feedback and support. We’re really grateful for that, and we created this free nutritionist tool as the next step. As we continue to do with our exercise platform, we’ll try to implement as much of the constructive feedback as we can.


A few things:

* The tools get better as you use them. Both in terms of meals and search, we’ve aimed to simplify and streamline the process of recording foods as much as possible. We want to help make what would otherwise be a cumbersome process as fast and simple as possible.

* Your recommendations change to reflect your training status. In terms of not only calories, but also muscle glycogen and carbohydrate recommendations (and soon electrolytes and other nutrients).

* Recommendations include not only macronutrients, but also goal-specific micronutrients like zinc and calcium. You can also set all of your own custom targets. 

* Mobile is on the way, and we’d also love your feedback and suggestions for it.

* This is of course still a work in progress and we're pushing hard to hit beta this summer. Some of the features we have planned include a broader range of health and athletic goals (with specific considerations for pre-existing health risks and conditions), as well as daily and weekly adjustments based on progress.

EDIT: we also support metric once you've logged in, and if there's a missing food you can also add your own foods while logged in.

Confirmed Diagnosis.",931,217,319,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1chv7v/update_drink_a_gallon_of_water_a_day_is_this/,"I made this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1b8a98/drinking_a_gallon_of_water_a_day_and_not_because/) and a lot of people responded. Thank you all for responding and I want to thank /u/Gizmeow for bringing up diabetes.

I went to see my doctor and got a full blood test. She called me yesterday and confirmed that I have type II diabetes. 

I am an otherwise healthy person, I M/21 and weight 180 lbs and go to gym 3 times a week. This diagnosis has been a shock and my doctor has put me on medication because my A1C was 12! I have gotten my blood sugar under control and it has fallen under 200 for the last week. My diet is a strict low carb, which means no bread, sugar or pasta. The best part of it is that I can have meat, lots and lots of meat I have had since then.

Hopefully this post serves as inspiration to you all. If you are/have:



Constantly thirsty
Constantly hungry
Frequent urination
Have dry lips
Have small cuts that don't heal for a long time
Fatigue
Blurred vision
Then you better see your doctor. At the very least, get your blood checked for free at a clinic or a pharmacy. If you ignore these symptoms then you are in danger of going into diabetic coma or diabetic ketoacidosis. 


Thanks to this subreddit, I am much more aware of the disease that I have and am much more capable of handling it.


Edit: some people are asking if they could be diabetic if they have one or more of these symptoms. While chances are high that if you have all of these symptoms, you might have diabetes or something else wrong with you and you should get checked out either way.  There are no known causes of diabetes, but research has proven that there are risk factors involved, which decides the likeliness that a person will get diabetes and hey include: 

    Bad diet
    Sedimentary (aka sedantary) lifestyle 
    Genetics (more likely if you have siblings with the disease)
    Climate (colder climates is more likely to help develop diabetes)
    Some diseases of the pancreas can also contribute
    
So if you have the symptoms and you also fit in the risk factors, then GET YOURSELF CHECKED OUT! 

While we are here, why not go over diabetes itself:

    Type I (""juvenile-onset"" - about 10% of people with diabetes) 
         Problem with the pancreas - doesn't make any or enough insulin
         Requires insulin shots
    Type II (""adult-onset"" - about 90% of people with diabetes)
         Problem with cells - cells become insulin resistant 
         Can be treated with proper diet and exercise, and pills if needed

I would love to have a normal schedule that would allow me to devote more time to getting better and faster over the past year but unfortunately that's not where I am currently.

My definition of hard work is being a full time student in law school, being the president of my class, working part time at a DA's office, being on a law review journal, volunteering at the VA hospital, doing the reading for 5 classes, doing a moot court competition, playing flag football and basketball on the side and trying to find 5 seconds to shower and eat and also making time to do some kind of physical activity. For me, it's not just a matter of getting off my ass and going to the gym. It's making sure that the rest of my life is squared away enough to allow for any kind of improvement in my fitness at all. It may not be super-star status, but with how little time I've got, and with how much I struggled at the beginning (felt like I had inhaled a hot coal, lips sometimes turned bluish, etc) I am pretty proud of myself for making any gains at all.

A big thanks to my wife's grandmother for showing me this.  She's the funniest elderly person I know.

Here's a funny story about her:  One time we were sitting at the kitchen table and she went to get something out of the fridge.  When she opened the door, a can of Guiness fell on to the floor.  This 5ft tall, elderly Italian woman then says, ""Oh, you want me drink you?""  And she did.

It doesn't seem that funny when I type it out, but I still chuckle when I think about it.

[This is what it looks like.](http://imgur.com/a/KXUDR)  Given that I like my eggs over easy, and the 3 egg flip is difficult for me under normal circumstances, I was pleased that I only broke one yolk.  The tomato kept the egg from becoming one solid slab of protein, so it looks a little mutilated.  This would surely look better with scrambled eggs.  Also I made it with bacon fat instead of olive oil because, well, it's bacon fat and it was already in the pan.  I washed it down with a can of Old Milwaukee.

You looked uncomfortable walking in for the first time. I could see you glancing nervously at the people in better shape than you, that combination of self-conscious anxiety and envy written clear as day across your face. I watched you out of the corner of my eye as you struggled to lift a little weight and walk briskly for a little while on the treadmill. If you saw me looking, I hope you understood that I wasn't judging you. I just wanted to make sure you didn't get hurt.

And, you made me think. You don't know this, but it reminded me of when I was starting out my new life for the first time. A lot of us that you were watching, half embarrassed and half to imitate, were exactly where you were once too. So know that there's no need to be ashamed, because we know just where you are and how you feel.

Congratulations on taking the first step. Good for you. I hope you keep it up, come back again and again, and become a regular. And if you do, I know that someday you'll be standing in my shoes, watching the next scared fat person glance enviously at you as they begin their new lives.

**TL;DR here's the album http://imgur.com/a/erKPU

Started as a BMI = 30 teenager. Got called fat etc. Started lifting, spent years fucking around and wasting time. Been training seriously for about two years. Made a lot of mistakes along the way. Progress is OK. Legs suck. Still not as good as scalpelburn/fatter than I'd like to be.**

First we'll do the basics. 

**Stats:**

- Weight: 190lbs.
- Age: 26
- Sex: Male
- Height: 6'1""
- I'd place my bodyfat @ 9%. 
- Squat 375, Bench 300, Deadlift 525. Wilks is a mediocre 350ish. 

**Bulking Routine:**

[This.](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.ca/2012/11/the-gzcl-method-for-powerlifting.html)

Also see [this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1bblg3/gzcl_method_report_3_months_in_365290485/)

- I use the second bench day to focus on shoulder presses and shrugs.

- I usually add an arms day on sundays. I do a lot of mobility work - foam rolling, stretching, 100-rep sets of light front raises/face pulls/reverse flyes.  

- I focus on volume on the second legs day - easier on my knee, better for dat hypertrophy. 

- I do calves every day. 

**Cutting Routine:**

- Essentially [this.](http://www.leangains.com/2008/12/reverse-pyramid-revisited.html). Four days a week.

- Monday: Legs; Wednesday: Chest; Friday: deads/back; Saturday: shoulders/mobility.

**Diet**

- I wave my calories and carbs. So I'll calculate my TDEE, multiply it by 7, and distribute those calories over the week. I eat more on my lifting days (the most on legs day) and much less on rest days. 

- When I bulk I eat breakfast, when I cut I use IF.

- My staples ARE: chicken (lean and whole), cottage cheese, greek yogurt+protein powder, protein shakes. Onions, bags of frozen veggies, brussel sprouts, mushrooms. Grapefruits, bananas, oats, poptarts/timbits. Natural peanut butter. 

- The only cardio I do = walking where I need to go, if I can't catch a bus.

**Problems I ran into**

- Being afraid of gaining fat. This seriously limited my progress once I started taking lifting seriously. I had been soft, and I was really afraid of going back. I still don't want to, but... it is easier now. Cutting isn't so hard.

- Not programming. **I wasted so much time.** So much time.

- Not eating enough protein. More time wasted. It took me awhile to start eating a lot of meat and etc. When I did (1g/lb bodyweight) gains came so much more easily.

- Maxing every fucking time I stepped in the gym. I had an ego for a bit. I didn't want strangers at the gym to think I was weak. I wanted to move the big weight every time. I don't care any more, and it's really helped my progress... to the point that I now move way bigger weight than I used to every time, *because it's now 80% of my max.*

- Damaging my left knee because of the above. I was embarrassed that my squat was so poor relative to the rest of me. I wouldn't squat as light as I needed. My right knee was stronger than my left, and that imbalance led to serious problems with my left knee which subsequently harmed my squat progression a great deal (inability to squat for weeks at a time). It took me a lot of time and practice to fix it. I still struggle with it. 

- Going too hard when I got overexcited and doing too much, leading to tendonitis in my left elbow and/or neck problems. 

- Not sleeping enough. 6hrs &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; the 10hrs I get now. I go to bed at like 9pm most nights and feel awesome. 

**Why I Lift**

Because I love it as an activity. It's all about patience, cultivation, learning, planning, tweaking. Endlessly interesting. I don't do it for the aesthetics though I do like being relatively lean and being able to see all my abs. I used to tell myself I just had fat on me, and it was my genetics, and that was that. It made perfect sense at the time. 

Lifting changed my life. Funny thing is, it started as an accident - I only went because my friend didn't want to lift alone and couldn't find anyone else. 

I wasted years fucking around, however. I'd go in, do some curls/tricep pushdowns/machine flyes and call it a day. I didn't regulate my diet at all. No goals. I only started seeing *real* progress when I read www.leangains.com (SHILL SHILL SHILL) around...april of 2011? And started squatting.

When I started getting swole - actually swole - everyone on earth treated me differently. Checkout people (especially women) were nicer. I became more confident and more assertive *simply as a result of people deferring to me more often.* Earlier this year I literally *wore a dress out to the bar* and guys... got the fuck out of my way. Not as a joke, but because ""if you can wear that and not give a fuck you must be tough"" and etc. - all the comments were like that. Guys backed away from urinals when I went to the bathroom. It was a bizarre experience. 

Around July of last year, dudes started approaching me in the gym, about 1/week. What do I eat, how do I get shoulders like that, do I just have good genetics (no). 

I also started getting the steroid accusations :( One time some guys in a car yelled it at me as I stood on a street corner /swoleacceptancesolidaritylolololololo. 

**Other stuff**

In preparation for this thread, I actually dehydrated myself. I got 'dry'. It was very uncomfortable, but I woke up shredded. I went to the gym, I got the pump, went downstairs, looked at myself, and I wasn't happy. 

It was really fucked up.

I wasn't having fun in the gym. I didn't like it. So I went upstairs, chugged a protein shake (oh no, water retention!), put on my hoodie and belt and started ripping weight. I had completely stomped on the prep I'd done for progress pictures, but I was happy again. I took the March 2013 pictures later on, post-easter feasting. 

I learned though I like looking nice, the pursuit of aesthetics - *especially the transient kind* - makes me very unhappy with myself. And above all else, to quote a video I can't find now, I lift because I like being a 'big, bad, weight-ripping motherfucker.'

(even though I'm not that big or bad : / )

**Next Steps**

Maintenance calories for a week, then I hop back on the high-volume GZCL gain train.

Hey everyone, if you frequent /r/weightroom you should know all about this by now, but I wanted to bring it to everyone here as well.

Swole Society is an idea that I've been tossing around in my head for the longest time, but got a couple of confirmations that the idea needed to be made over the past few months.

I've spent a lot of time taking things up to this point, interviewing tons of guys, getting their measurements(got a lot of help from reddit here), creating a sizing chart, building relationships with manufacturers and fabric suppliers, working with designers and pattern graders, building out the web site, getting everything set up. I took it as far as I could (with all the money I had) before getting it to this point. So far the response has been great. Are things exactly how I want them? Not exactly, but the campaign is growing and there will be updates to show progress as it moves along.

It's now day 3 of the campaign and we've already raised $1400. There's a statistic on the Internet that says when a kickstarter campaign gets to 30% funding, they have a 90% chance of succeeding. With the support of the community so far I can easily see us reaching that point.

Please watch the video and see if you're interested. If you like the idea consider making a pledge to receive our first batch of shirts that will be shipping out mid-January. Community involvement is probably the most important aspect of a successful campaign.

Thanks for reading!

*edit*

I'd also like to say smaller pledges are just as important as the bigger ones (plus you can get a cool Live Swole wrist band). If you're uncomfortable about kickstarter and/or waiting a long time to get your stuff, remember the idea won't fly unless we hit the goal, so every little bit counts. Thank you.

*edit 2*

Good news everyone. I just worked out getting a small minimum order of fabric from our supplier, and will be creating some finalized show-pieces in its finished form. If everything goes correctly it should be done around the end of next week. 

*edit 3*

The name isn't changing for now, guys. 

*edit 4*

Thanks to everyone so far, a large chunk of pledges have come from reddit. We're almost at that magical 30% marker, and it's thanks to everyone here. Since today is going so well I will get some production-fabric samples produced and take all the fancy pictures with close-ups and macros and all that.

*edit 5*

OK. I'll look into the name. Nothing is final at the moment (except for the fact you'll get a great shirt).

*edit final for the day*

Wow. It's only 8PM and we're just shy of the 30% goal. I didn't think it would happen so fast but I put it out there and you all delivered. The campaign is growing and improving continuously. So make sure you keep tabs on it and watch it change and grow as the campaign continues. We still have 20+ days to go, and I'll see if it's ok with the moderators to let me make another thread on the last day of the campaign if we still haven't reached our goal. 

I tried to answer everyone's concerns and questions over the past few hours, hope I didn't leave anyone feeling like they were ignored.

In general, when I'm thinking about it (or right after that 12 minute posture workout when my lower back is nice and tight), I can easily stand up straight and look good. However, inevitably when I get tired or distracted I slouch back to old habits, and standing up fully straight still doesn't really feel like a ""natural"" position for me (for example, when I do the wall test with my back against the wall, it feels like I have to pull my neck back considerably to get the back of my head to touch the wall). It doesn't help that I have a desk job.

I'm interested in hearing stories from folks that have been able to improve their posture to the point that they no longer need to think about it.

I was just curious to see if anyone else does the same thing. Let's share! 

Here are mine:

* If I forget which set I'm on, I *must always* choose the lesser amount. This sometimes leads me to muttering, but if at any time I'm not sure if it's two or three, I have to assume it's two. Sometimes, when I'm on my last set, I realize that I was wrong, but I still make it a point not to argue with my rule. It also keeps me honest. 

* I count by fives or less. So, if I have to do 10 reps, I count 1-2-3-4-5, 1-2-3-4-5. If I go nine, I go three by three by three. I don't know why, but it feels easier to do this way. Yes, I know it makes no sense. 

* If doing indoor cardio, I don't look at the time. I'll pick up a magazine and lay it over the timer. Sometimes I'll peek, but I try not too. This doesn't work with HIIT. I find having the clock exposed draws my eye, and I get bored. With no clock to look at, I tend to let my mind drift, and it makes it more enjoyable. 

* When lifting, I listen to audiobooks. I find that the measured pace helps me lift slower, whereas music makes me want to pump to the rhythm.

* When using barbells, I use the smaller weights if I can. So, if I need a 45 plate, I'll sometimes use a 25 plus two 10s. Again, I don't know why, but it feels more doable. I also tell myself that if I max, I can always take off a smaller one (though this rarely happens).

Hey Fittit! Brian (aka xenowang) from Fitocracy here. Boy, what a year it's been. When I first posted about Fitocracy back [in December 2010](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/elu2k/trying_to_turn_fitness_into_more_like_an_rpg_i/), we were incredibly humbled that several hundred of you took an interest in what we were doing. Frankly, I'm shocked that you guys gave us the time of day considering how horrifically bad Fitocracy was back then. Today, Fitocracy is worlds apart from where we started and much of that is due to your feedback as well as having an awesome community presence there.

Fun fact: if you read that very first post, you'll notice that Daniel (aka diafygi) posted a crap ton of feedback there. We were complete strangers back then... and then 5 months later he quit his job in Texas and moved to NYC to join the team.

We've been in private beta for the entire time Fitocracy's been running, but we've finally reached the point where we're ready to open up to the public (for real). That won't happen for another few weeks, but since Fittit is where we got our start, we want to thank the community by posting an invite link that should be good for pretty much anybody that wants access to Fitocracy right now. **[CLICK IT BIATCHES!](http://ftcy.co/Aa6XLN)**

It's pretty amazing that we're still here one year later. Fitocracy has always been based on the idea of leveling up yourself in real life and I'm happy to say that in 2012, we're going to be running even faster toward that goal. In 2011 we saw points, levels, achievements, quests. In 2012, we're going to see our native mobile apps, fitness stats (think: STR, CON, INT, etc), PvP, a mentoring system, and more. You guys have been with us since Day 1 so you'll always have a special place in our hearts. Thank you for all your support. &lt;3

I did and signed up at my local gym. It has a boxing ring, so a great extra.  The first day i had no idea what to do, some guy saw me looking confused as hell and picked out a great workout routine for me from bodybuilding.com. Btw the first day he helped me get some work on my chest and I proceeded to puke in the parking lot afterwards. 

Felt great though. I have been following this routine for 2 weeks now and I feel great. Here are some side effects I noticed that no one really told me about. 

1; I sleep really early and wake up really early. Like 10pm-6am. I have so much room for activities now, holy fuck. 

2; Eating schedule, before I would eat at random times and would eat a lot of junk food and stuff. Now I eat 3-4 times a day. There a nice gap in between the meals, which just happened.  

3: I cant eat junk food anymore, no matter how hard I try I just can't do it. I look at chips and chocolate and my head does a 180. I went to a store 4 days ago to buy some bagel bites, instead came out with a bag of organic salad. 

4: Acne, yeah I am losing acne at a rapid rate, my skin is starting to get the natural color back. From a good 5 ft you can't even tell I have acne(looking in the mirror under a light bulb). It feels great and I am getting confidence boost.

* December 2011: http://imgur.com/l48A5
* December 2012: http://imgur.com/a/AT1qJ

**Body weight**

* Starting: 163 lbs
* After about eight months on SS: 168 lbs - 170 lbs
* Post cut: 156 lbs


Like the title states, I began Starting Strength one year ago. I had virtually no weightlifting experience then (only did cardio and light bodyweight exercises). I began with a weight of about 163 lbs at a height of 5'9.5"".

My lifts when starting were as follows (taken from my journal):

**3x5 Working weights (start):**

* Squat: 175 lbs
* Bench: 145 lbs
* Deadlift: 185 lbs (1x5 per SS)
* Press: 75 lbs
* Power cleans: 75 lbs (5x3 per SS, poor form initially)

**Currently (as of last week) my lifts (also 3x5 working weights) are:**

* Squat: 290 lbs
* Bench: 205 lbs
* Dead: 345 lbs (1x5)
* Press: 125 lbs
* Power clean: 175 lbs (5x3)

**Current 1RM**

* Squat: 350 lbs
* Bench: 230 lbs
* Deadlift: 420 lbs
* Press: 135 lbs
* Power clean: 205 lbs

During this time I also did the accessory lifts including alternating between pull ups and pendlay rows on ""B"" days and adding dips and incline dumbbell bench on ""A"" days. 

In addition, I performed cardio on Tuesdays/Thursdays (alternating between three miles of steady-state running and 20 minutes of sprinting HIIT). I know that cardio isn't typically recommended, but I've also enjoyed running and wanted to keep my heart and cardiovascular system healthy so I kept it up.

**Reprogramming**

About three months ago, I started to reprogram my lifts seeing as how I began stalling very hard. I kept the same basic SS framework but added a few exercises/sets. Here is what I do now:

**Day A**

* Squat: see below
* Bench: 3x5, 1xfailulre narrow/wide-grip bench (alternate each ""A"" day)
* Deadlift: 1x5, 2x3 deficit pull at less weight
* Incline dumbbell press: 3x8

**Day B**

* Squat: see below
* Press: 3x5, 1xfailure at less weight
* Power cleans: 5x3
* Pull ups/pendlay rows: 3x10/3x8
* Dumbbell shoulder press (sitting): 3x8

I'm still squatting three days a week, but my programming is to do regular 3x5 low-bar squats on Mondays, 3x5 front squats on Wednesdays, and 5x3 heavy low-bar on Fridays. I'm also switching to high-bar every other week to transition into olympic lifting.

**Diet**

I've never had a problem eating. I used to be quite overweight in high school and college so I've kept my appetite up this whole time. Initially, my appetite exploded and I could never eat enough food. I wasn't counting, but I would estimate my intake was well over 3000 calories a day before my cut. 

I did take protein powder (Muscle Milk, but recently switched to Gold Whey when I heard about the heavy metals in MM). I also tried to minimize refined carbs and eat mostly protein and green vegetables. My favorite foods during this year were broccoli (roasted, sauteed, steamed, boiled), salad with Newman's dressing (caesar or oil/vinegar), steak, tofu, eggs, and of course chicken breast.

**Cutting**

About two months ago I decided to cut. I was satisfied with my strength gains and want see what I would look like with lower body fat. Before I started my cut I was around 168-170 lbs. I'm now 156 lbs, and I think it's made quite a difference in appearance. 

Picture before I started cutting: http://imgur.com/Nl6QP

To do this, I regulated my diet more by trying to be much more **consistent** and **routine**. For instance, I eat the same thing for breakfast: two scrambled eggs, one chicken sausage link, one tomato, and coffee. My lunch is typically a salad at work and dinner is another salad (lots of greens, roasted chicken breast, avocado, tomato) and soup. 

I also started to do some ab work during this time. I'd never done sit-ups or any ab work before because I read it was unnecessary. Nevertheless, it seemed to produce some good results so I kept it up. 

I've managed to keep my lifts constant and even progressed in squats, presses, and cleans (albeit at a much slower pace). I think it's important to keep trying to add weight even while cutting.

**The Future**

I want to compete in a powerlifting competition next year. Haven't chose a weight class yet but I'm leaning towards 152 lbs. I've also dabbled in olympic weightlifting and want to get more into that as well. Currently I am snatching 135 lbs and clean and jerking 185 lbs, but I've still got a ways to go in terms of form before I can really ratchet up the weight. Here's a recent video of me performing some oly lifts: http://youtu.be/NAFoQbR3Rvw

I've had cystic acne my entire life. I took acutane as a young adult and every other topical and internal acne medicine you can imagine, but my acne persisted even as an adult. I wash my face three times a day. But nothing helps at all. It's very embarrassing and emotionally difficult.

When the big derecho storm hit our area last month, I was without power for seven days. During that time, my acne cleared-up almost completely. I could not believe it and it caused me to suspect my diet played a large role in my acne.

Before the storm, I drank about two gallons of milk every week and ate a block of cheddar cheese too. I love the stuff. When the power went out, everything in my fridge spoiled so I had to throw it all out. Many days the temperature was close to 100 so the food spoiled quickly. 

When the power came back on, I went out and bought groceries with milk and cheese as usual and I broke out again right away. I then began searching the web for anything about diet and acne and I found that milk/dairy has been suspected for causing acne for years, but it's taboo in America to mention this. Criticizing milk is like criticizing Mom, Baseball and Apple Pie. You just don't do that.

This Australian guy charts his acne break-outs as they increase while he eats dairy products. He gets completely clear when he stops, then starts eating dairy again to record his outbreaks. His spreadsheets linking his acne rate to his dairy consumption are amazing: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheClearSkinStudy

This guy is a dermatologist and he has lot's of research papers that demonstrate a link to the hormones found in milk to acne and other illnesses in humans: http://acnemilk.com/

This guy is a medical doctor who has seen lot's of medical conditions improve greatly (sometimes entirely) when patients stop consuming dairy products: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O-ehIkwGME

The hormones in pregnant cow milk are natural and cannot be removed. They are close to Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone which is known to play a part in several conditions, including acne.

I just want to tell this story to others who may be suffering with acne. I accidentally cured myself and I hope that this information helps you!

Thanks Reddit.


**Edit. Most of my links are anecdotal, so here's a real scientific study demonstrating a link between dairy and acne**

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194824

""CONCLUSION: We found a positive association between intake of skim milk and acne. This finding suggests that skim milk contains hormonal constituents, or factors that influence endogenous hormones, in sufficient quantities to have biological effects in consumers.""

Current weight: 160

I started working out for entirely vain reasons. We won a trip to Disney World from a TV station and my wife and I were worried they would want to videotape us for commercials or something. Literally, as soon as the call ended, I told my wife that I was going on a diet.

Now, 10 months later, I feel like a new man. I wasn't THAT big to begin with, but I'm probably in the best shape of my life right now. I know I still have a long way to go, but I'm doing this for me now and not just so I look better.

How I did it:

First and foremost, I started the [Richard Jeni diet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7GnOyd_z1w&amp;safety_mode=true&amp;persist_safety_mode=1&amp;safe=active).

I was eating WAY more than any human being needed to. My wife works in the evenings, so after the kids went to bed, I basically laid on the couch and ate.

Once I learned to control my eating (which was not even remotely easy), I realized I was eating out of boredom and not hunger.

We took the time to look at our diet and what we needed to cut out. We still indulge in take-out, but on a smaller scale and with smaller portions. We also found a bunch of low cal recipes that are both simple and delicious.

I started walking on the treadmill everyday. Soon, I was jogging, and now, I'm running ten miles a day. I'm getting ready for my first race in just a few weeks.

If you had asked me about running one year ago, I'd have laughed in your face. I would see people jogging on the side of the road and think that they were crazy.

Now, I honestly can't wait to put on my running shoes and go. My wife and I ran the 10 mile race course this past Saturday and, when we were done, I just decided to run another five miles.

I'm also weightlifting 4-5 times a week. I do 4 sets of 4 exercises usually with 10 reps per set. The exercises depend on which muscle group I'm targeting that day. I try to keep it varied as much as I can with my home equipment.

I owe a lot of it to you guys. I have found a lot of great ideas on here. New exercises or just plain motivation. The FAQ alone set me straight about a lot of things.

Thank you.

1328202768.0,667,self.Fitness,p7w3v,Hey fitness newcomers... stop overthinking the process of working out. Read and take to heart this quote from Anthony Hunter.,869,202,214,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/p7w3v/hey_fitness_newcomers_stop_overthinking_the/,"From [trainer Anthony Hunter in this set of interviews](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_interviews/body_of_work_the_rest_of_the_cast):

&gt;... the best advice I have is just freaking do it and quit worrying about the small things. I had a kid the other day busting my chops about eating fructose. He was like, ""But Anthony, I'm worried about eating fructose as it is most easily converted to fat ... "" The dude was 110 pounds!

&gt;Another was concerned about whether the protein he was using had enough casein to have it at night. He hadn't even started training yet! I was like, ""You don't need to freaking know everything. Just start!""

&gt;Bottom line for your readers: Everybody knows the basics, but not everybody does the basics. It's like climbing a mountain. You can study graphs and wind speeds and weather conditions all you want, but at some point you have to just start climbing.

So many of you come in with questions, trying to tweak so much before you've even gotten ankle deep in a workout plan. Most of the battle is just DOING IT on schedule every week and getting your body used to physical activity it isn't used to.

Just pick a program and go. Just make some simple dietary changes (fewer or no processed foods, more protein, more fruit/vegetables) and go, then make sure you get rest between workouts. That alone is more than what 90-95% of the population does for their health, and will give you results if you follow the form of a given workout and stick to it with discipline.

Don't worry about the details until you hit a wall or level off, and even then look at what you're doing and see if you can make remedial improvements here and there. 95% of the time you run into problems you already know the answers if you just take a stark honest look at your own habits: It often comes back to discipline and personal responsibility.",,False,,t5_2qhx4,True,,,True,t3_p7w3v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/p7w3v/hey_fitness_newcomers_stop_overthinking_the/,

I crawled back up to 165 by the end of our relationship, wearing a size 12. In late 2011, I got a fire up my ass and decided that enough was enough; I *was* going to be hott again! I started back up with Weight Watchers and going to the gym, doing circuits. Got myself down to 145 pounds and a size 8 in, again, about 8 months. Excitement! The holidays of 2012 attacked me and I got back up to 155-ish by January and those 8s were getting a little snug. About a month ago, I started doing Jillian Michaels' diet and excerisize program. Now I am 150 pounds, starting to see a LOT of tone and my pants feel (and look) awesome! I still want to lose 15-20 more pounds, but I am extremely proud of myself!

If you’re confused about what you have, [this is a pretty good example of a PPT](http://www.pt.ntu.edu.tw/hmchai/kines04/kinapplication/StandingPosture.files/SwayBack.png). Notice how the lower back is flat and doesn’t have any kind of arch to it. The upper body will have a bigger hunch than a person with an anterior tilt because the spine has to compensate. The shoulders will be over the heels and the chin will be protruded forward a lot. It basically looks like you’re sitting when you stand, or that you're leaning back when standing. On the flip side, [this is a classic example of an APT](http://images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/20080320/293.kardashian.kim.032008.jpg). The upper body is not in too much of a hunch but the shoulders will slump forward and will stay more over the toes. The stomach will protrude towards the floor a bit, even if you are very lean. If you still don’t know what kind of posture you’re in, post a picture or get it assessed by a qualified professional, preferably somebody with a Functional Movement Screen background.

**Note: A bit of APT is normal for people. In fact it’s optimal. All top level athletes will have a degree of APT because it puts the glutes into a more advantageous position to exert force.**

Ok now that that’s out of the way, the point of this write-up is to create a short warm-up or off-day circuit that you can do every day to keep your posture in check. Just because you have a posture problem doesn’t mean that you have to stop lifting weights. But, lifting weights cements posture. If you have good posture, it’ll make it better. Bad posture will get worse. So make sure that when you’re lifting weights, you go through the full range of motion and don’t sell yourself short by lifting more than you can handle for less ROM. You’ll thank me later.


**Circuit for APT**

1.	[Hip flexor stretch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_hQSJVIN3c) - 2 x 20 seconds (if you can’t do the bent knee version, keep your foot down or on a lower bench)

2.	[Cook hip bridge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4I9F9rIqwM) – 2x12 each side (Make sure your movements are slow and controlled. Really focus on squeezing your glute and pushing through your heel)

3.	[Clams](http://www.mikereinold.com/2011/04/the-hip-external-rotation-clamshell-exercise.html) – 2x8 each side

4.	[Planks](http://www.wannabebig.com/training/general-physical-preparedness-core-strength-and-conditioning/plank-progressions-for-killer-abs/) (1x40 seconds) or [Dead Bugs](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_repair/core_training_for_smart_folks) (3x8 each side)

5.	[Thoracic extensions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICtEOwA3r_U&amp;feature=player_embedded) -2x 12

Very important: brace your abs and glutes throughout the stretches in this. If your lower back gets tight after these exercises, you're either pushing your range of motion too much or not bracing your abs enough.

**Circuit for PPT**

1.	[Hamstring stretch](http://www.velogirls.com/resources/publications/stretching101/lying_hamstring.jpg) -2 x 20 seconds (Roll up a hand towel and place it under your lower back in order to create a natural arch in the back. In fact for every stretch where you’re lying down, you should be doing that)

2.	I don’t have a video for this so I’ll try to explain it. Lie down with your legs straight, place your fingers under your lower back so that the tips touch other, palms down. From this position, raise one leg up as high as you can. Stop when you feel your back pressing into the fingers, and return down to the starting position. Go controlled and.

Go through your [normal warm-up](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ezlfn/repost_how_to_warmup_effectively_lift_more_for/) after this to raise core body temperature and some joint mobility/dynamic mobility work to get some synovial fluids into the joints. Yes it will extend your warm-up but if you have a dysfunction, you want to spend time fixing it and not mindlessly banging out reps in the gym.

On a side note, if you are in a PPT and have active back pain, you may want to lay off the bilateral stuff like squats, deadlifting and overhead pressing. This can put a lot of pressure on the tendons and ligaments in the spine and create worse back problems. Fix your PPT first then come back to two legged weightlifting. In the meantime you can work on single leg work. It doesn’t put as much pressure on the discs and you can get insanely strong.

Also, I really shouldn't have to mention that you shouldn't be doing crunches when you're in a PPT. It's just bad. Don't do them. If you're in an APT and want to do crunches, read [this](http://ericcressey.com/lumbar-flexion-strength-training-programs-reverse-crunch) first.

Ever since I was 9 years old, i was overweight. I was always made fun of in school and got put down by everybody. Only had a few people who i was actually friends with. I was not active at all during school. I would go home and play video games instead of going out and hanging out. Ever since I graduated high school in May 2010, There are only a few people I keep in contact with. After i graduated, I started hanging out with new people and made a few friends. I never had a girlfriend that was serious. They always ended up using me and cheating on me. After being called fat and ugly all my life, I decided it was time to change. In September 2010, I was 261Lbs with a 44 inch waist and 2XL shirt size. Now I weigh 184.5Lbs with a 31 inch waist and a small shirt size the shirt in the picture is a medium. I was 176 in August/September 2011. I will post a before pic when i can find one. My goal is to get to 170Lbs by spring. I am 6'1"" tall and 20 years old.

I decided to put a lower body shot in there although it isn't very impressive so no one has to ask but I find it difficult to build size in the legs with bwf. when I go to college next year (Aus) I will be using the gym as well as body weight and then move on to what I deem fit from there.

The pics were taken over the course of a week so some of the images have the face cut out and some don't.

So far I have stuck almost exclusively to Bodyweight exercise however sometimes with the added resistance of dumbbells/weighted pull-ups.

**Stats**

11KM (6.8Miles) - 49:26

Pull Ups - 30

Push ups - 70

Raised L sit - 35 seconds

Muscle Ups - 6

Squats - 250-300 depending on the day

Height - 175 CM (5 foot 9)

Weight - 64kg (141Pounds)

A year and a half ago I joined my school's Full On Fitness class for 15-16 yr olds and stuck to a program 5 days a week 80 minutes a day and these so far are my results, sorry for the lack of before pictures but I was always a skinny kid and before I started I was about 50kg.

I will be going to bed just after posting this but will answer all (most) questions/advice/criticism when I get up before/during school.

**Edit:** It is 7:42 AM where I am so I'll type my routine out when I get to school in first period or I will miss the bus. The response I have gotten to this was actually overwhelming; When I woke up I was feeling stress/nervous for today due to teenage reasons but I feel ecstatic now.  

**Edit2: My Routine**

**Sunday:** Rest, walk the dog, maybe some Parkour

**Monday:**

 Hard Circuit due to an easy weekend. tends to look like;

2 KM run from school to the park

10x Pull Up

30x Deep Squat

25x Push Up

30x Sit Up

20x Dips on Parallel Bars

25x Lunges Each Side

5 sets of this then a 2km run back to school and I usually get into a pull up competition with a few others which progresses to around 40-50 before class ends.

**Tuesday:**

 Long distance run, anywhere from 8KM-12KM

**Wednesday:** Small Aerobic Circuit

5x Pull-ups

10x Squats,lunges,push ups, dips, Calf-raises, Sit Ups.

In this circuit there is no rest between exercises and a 1.5KM run after each set, total of 10 sets.

**Thursday:**

Near our school we have a thing called the Trugga track.

1.5KM run from school to the base of the track. 3KM to the top and 3KM back down. It is basically a very steep muddy hill with a stair case built in that leads to the top. I am yet to run the entire thing including there and back.

**Friday:**

Repeat of Monday or Wednesday depending on how I am feeling.

**Saturday:** 

Rest, maybe a light jog with the dog.

Each session lasts for 80 minutes apart from Wednesdays. Monday and Tuesday nights I have an Intermediate and Advanced Muay Thai class that last 90 minutes.

I started a year and a half ago at around 5 Pull-ups, 20 Push-ups and not being able to run anymore than 2 KM.

I don't see the point of Cutting/Bulking as all I see are complaints on losing your strength in order to look better. I eat as if I am on a bulk but exercise as if I'm doing both in order to maintain performance year round.

Don't really have many people to tell this to so I figured I would let you guys know!

Hi, fittit! First, I just want to say thank you for everyone in this sub for creating a informed and welcoming environment where skinnybros can learn the Way of the Buff. At the end of last summer I decided I wanted to get in shape. I was in pretty good cardiovascular shape, meaning that I could run a few miles without much effort, but I was still pretty scrawny and I wanted to change that. Then I found fittit, and my world changed. I learned a crapload about exercise and physiology, and I implemented what I learned in the gym.

I started at about 160 or so pounds, and decided first to cut down to 155 because I wanted to see what I would look like with abs. That was fun, and then I soon decided it was time to bulk up. While bulking, I pretty much just ate whatever I could get my hands on, making sure that I had a bunch of protein. My weight topped out at 170 a few months, and from there I decided to cut back down in preparation for summer. I've been cutting for the past month and a half and now I'm back down to 157.

You will probably notice a conspicuous lack of decent leg exercises, aside from some calf raises and hip thrusts that I did to correct my APT. I started out doing Bulgarian Split Squats for a couple months, but began to hate them to that point where I stopped doing them altogether (I know, I know - this is why I don't have leg pics lol). I don't look disproportionate, but one of my goals for the end of the summer when I start bulking again is to go hard on my legs, mostly because I think it will help with my posture and I want to feel more stable when I walk. My goal for this time next year is to gain about twelve pounds of muscle, most of which I hope to be on my arms, legs, and right pec because there's a bit of an imbalance there. We'll see.

Anywho, here's my routine:

**Bent-Over Dumbbell Rows - 85 lbs - 3x10** while bulking (while cutting I've found that I've been decreasing the number of reps in each set, so it's pretty much been 10-8-6 reps with the same amount of weight. This has held true for pretty much all my exercises while cutting). 

**Dumbell Chest Press - 40 lbs per DB - 3x10**

**Planks - BW - 3 sets, anywhere from 1 to 1.5 minutes per set** depending on how I'm feeling 

**Hip Thrusts - BW - 3x25**

**Roman Chair - BW - 2x20**, alternating between straight-leg and bent-leg raises with each rep 

**Face Pulls - 90lbs - 3x10**

**Calf Raises (machine) - 250 lbs - 3x10**

**Sitting Row Machine - 120lbs - 3x10**


I usually end my workouts by doing wide-grip pull-ups to failure, then dips to failure, and then pull-ups and dips again.

Thanks again, feel free to ask any questions.

Edit: I'm 5'10"".
Edit Número Dos:
While cutting, my diet consists mostly of misery with a side of slight irritability. I really like food, especially carbs. Seriously though, right now I usually have a protein shake with breakfast, perhaps with fried eggs if its a workout day. Around mid morning I'll have a protein bar to keep my calorie::protein ratio up (I figure I should have about one gram of protein for every 13 calories, and since I like carbalicious dinners I go heavy on the protein in the morning). For lunch I'll usually have chicken with a vegetable, I'm partial to peppers and onions. I also make a mean chili, which is a great low-cal, high-protein meal. For dinner I'll usually have some meat/carb/veggie combo. Healthy Choice meals are usually pretty good, as are Voila ready to serve meals. It's hard for me to stay away from tasty high-sodium stuff when I'm cutting. Also, Taco Bell's soft chicken fresco tacos have a pretty good calorie to protein ratio. I generally try to eat between 1850 and 2100 calories a day, and at least 145 grams of protein.

Rhonda Smith used to be a bodybuilder. A pretty serious one. The 40-year-old Chandler mother of two competed in 2000 at the National Physique Committee event in Denver and again in 2010 in Chandler.

When she goes to the gym, she knows what she’s doing. But the LA Fitness member says she’s frustrated about getting harassed over her workouts with friends.

During a recent trip to the gym at 24th Street and Baseline Road in south Phoenix, Smith said a trainer at LA Fitness approached her as she worked out with her friends.

“He’s not happy. He asks to speak with me privately,” Smith said.

Smith said the trainer told her that she wasn’t allowed to work out in groups and the women she was with were not allowed to coach each other. Smith said the trainer told her she could face a lawsuit if the club found out she was providing instruction for her friends.

“We (me and my friends) are there for the same purpose, to motivate each other, to encourage, to provide instruction,” Smith said. “If my form is wrong, I expect them to tell me, if their form is wrong, I will correct them as well.”

Smith complained to a gym manager, who contacted the LA Fitness corporate office in Los Angeles.

The corporate representative and the gym manager confirmed what the trainer had originally told Smith. LA Fitness does not allow its members to coach or train each other. Language outlining that rule is written in the standard LA Fitness contract. The company also told Smith that if she continued the practice, the gym could revoke her membership.

Smith said she was not charging any of the women for training sessions. She believes LA Fitness’ goal is to get its members to pay for coaching from the gym’s personal trainers. “That point was clearly made by the trainer and the woman from headquarters,” Smith said.

Call 12 for Action reached out to LA Fitness’ public-relations department, but no one responded with a comment.

Call 12 for Action checked with other large popular gyms in the Phoenix area, and they all have different policies. Some allow members to coach each other as long as they don’t charge money. Others don’t have any rules forbidding it.

Bottom line for all consumers: Check the fine print before signing gym contracts.

1375916302.0,641,self.Fitness,1jx12m,Today I had an accident in the squat rack that didn't involve shitting myself,1044,403,442,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1jx12m/today_i_had_an_accident_in_the_squat_rack_that/,"So I've read all sorts of stories on here about people shitting themselves in the squat rack and I still don't understand how. In any case, I now have an embarrassing story to rival all of that.

I've been doing SS for a month or so, so I'm squatting every day. I'm ultimately training for size, so it feels good whenever I notice my clothes getting tighter. In particular, lately when I do squats and deadlifts, the tension in my core sometimes pops the top button of my shorts open. But I'd kind of got used to this.

Anyway, today I had a bit of a hectic day, so while I usually go to the gym when there aren't that many people around, today I ended up there while it was almost full (I train at a large commercial gym - there were probably 50+ people on the floor). Fortunately everyone at my gym is a bit of pussy and I'm the only one that squats, so the rack was free immediately. However, it's also worth mentioning that due to the hecticness of my day, I forgot to bring a spare pair of underwear. So I made the choice to go commando during the session in order to have them clean for afterwards.

I did my warm up and then started my first heavy squat set. Went really well, ATG, hit a 5RM PR (80kg, so not that much, but I still feel pretty good about it, especially in comparison to how I feel about the rest of this story). Took a break and then went for set 2. About 3 reps in, I felt a sort of tear...

Just to briefly explain, the squat rack is located in the front of the gym, and also is adjacent to two mirrors, so literally everyone would have been able to see what went down.

So yeah, suddenly the captain and his crew were sailing free in the open ocean. Looking in the mirror, I could see the extent of the damage - everything was completely visible. I lowered the weight to the bars as quickly as I felt I could safely, and then dropped to the floor to cover my tracks. I then thought about what to do.

It so happened that I had a spare pair of shorts back in the locker room, but I had to get there first. At the time I didn't really realise the extent of the rip, so I thought that when I stood up it would just get lost in the folds of the clothing. With this in mind, I got up and quickly made my way to the locker room, where upon further inspection I discovered that actually the hole was so big that I would have definitely been giving people a further opportunity to inspect my nethers.

Anyway, you'll be pleased to know I went back out and finished my session like a champ. Not sure when I should chance returning though...

Anyway, please make me feel better about myself by telling me some of your own embarrassing gym stories.

tl;dr: Squats didn't solve all my problems.

Edit: So I took some pictures of the shorts this morning.

I'm a long time lover of the sub &amp; I'm an active member here on my regular account, but I don't want my SO to see this post through my normal one so I made a throwaway - I hope that's okay!

My question is, like I said: How were your hormones while you were leaning out? And how was your sex drive? I ask because I've noticed a severe decrease in sexual desire from my SO now that he's down to 8% BF, and I basically just want to know if that's a thing that happens to most men. He's commented that he just doesn't feel horny, and that the feeling is very odd to him. He's been dieting down for about 4 months now, and everything was perfectly normal until he got down to 10% and ever since it's just been declining. He's not planning on staying down at this BF for very long, I think he's going to drop to 6-7% within the next two weeks, do a photo shoot &amp; then start to bulk.

So, if you've had the same thing happen, could you let me know how you felt, how you dealt with it, and how long it lasted? Anything else you have to say is definitely welcome. Thanks in advance for any replies! I really **(really)** appreciate it.

Size 36 jeans and large shirts to size 30 jeans and small/medium shirts :)

I still have a ways to go, I'd like to drop some more bodyfat so my abs will be more defined, but I've finally reached the point where I'm not embarrassed to take my shirt off anymore, and where I can look good by just throwing on a tightish t-shirt, and it feels great.  

Most of the change came rapidly in the past 5 months or so, when I moved to a country that doesn't have fast food, which was also right about the time that what had started as work just became habit... I think the big thing that needs to happen is gym and nutrition just have to become part of your routine.  Anyway, here's what my workout plan has been so far...  Essentially the plan that has worked for me after some trial and error is lower body strength, upper body vanity, and a bit of cardio...

Lower Body - 7 Day split:

Squats 5x5, 265 pound max

Deadlifts 5x5, 365 max

Upper Body, 3 day split:

Dumbbell Press 3x8

Incline Dumbbell press 3x8

Dips 3x8

Pull ups 3x10

Close Grip Bench Press 3x8

Dumbell Curls 3x8 (fuck yeah, curls)

Ab Wheel from the knee: 3x8

Hanging Leg Raise 3x10

Overhead Dumbbell Press 3x8

Chin Ups 3x10

Cardio:  5km runs twice a week or so

Nutrition:

Was never really strict about this, I probably could have made better progress if I was... But I basically just restrict carbs within the realm of sanity, and try to stick to a diet that consists mostly of protein and fat.  Lots of whey protein.  Used creatine for a couple months, but haven't had any supplements besides whey and a multi for the past 2 months or so.  I eat basically no vegetables or fruit... I eat lots of eggs, yogurt (both greek and the more junky kind), cheese, a metric shit-ton of fish, and lots of other meats as well.  I try to avoid bread and sugar, but will still eat whatever for the most part, and I don't shy away from beer either.  Still losing weight while maintaining or gaining strength, at a rate of abouttt a pound a week.  

I think the biggest mistake I made early on was getting too caught up in the ""get big and strong"" mentality that dominates /r/fitness... Not that there's anything wrong with that, but my goal was primarily to improve my appearance... so when I switched gears and started restricting calories more heavily and started doing 3x8s on my upper body and added cardio, I started getting the results I was looking for much more quickly.  And the thing is, I HAVE gotten stronger, MUCH stronger, I just haven't been optimizing for max strength gain, and I'm happy with that.  I mean, I couldn't even do a pullup or a dip when I started this, and I've gotten my bench to 215 as well, along with respectable squats and deadlifts, and I think that's fine.

Unfortunately in combination with depression (mainly caused by my addiction) I've spent the last 4 years pretty much a recluse. My career revolves around computers, so from 9am-6pm I'm sitting in a cheap computer chair, and from 6pm until bedtime I'm sitting on my couch.

The road to recovery is going to last the rest of my life and without proper exercise and diet I think I'll be doomed to relapse.

For anyone that doesn't know about acute and post acute withdrawal symptoms from opioids they come with sever body aches, sore muscles, and fatigue.

Once my acute withdrawal period is over and I can actually practice good sleep hygiene I want to start walking/jogging in the morning before work.

Until then, what are some light exercises that I can do at home in the mornings (preferably without any equipment) that will help me get through the body aches, soreness, and fatigue? They'll have to be rather light at first, because the fatigue is absolutely overwhelming. I'm not super weak normally, but right now I can't even complete more than one pushup. :(

First, I'd like to thank Tkon for making his progress post on either r/fitness or r/leangains a few months ago; it's the entire reason I started leangains and partly why I'm making this post.

I've lurked here (r/leangains, r/fitness and r/weightroom) for a while, so thank you to everyone who has posted here with helpful information.

I've been on a -20/+20 (% of TDEE) recomp since July and only recently switched to a -20/+30 bulk, so most of the progress from the album was from a recomp. RPT the whole way. My TDEE is ~1850.

Some notes:

-I fasted for 14-16 hours every day (feeding window was 12:30 - 8:30 PM).

-I counted calories pretty meticulously for a few weeks or so when I started, but after that I mostly eyeballed food and estimated. I tried to get around 2200 calories on workout days and 1500 on rest days, +- 50-100. I still weigh food I'm not really sure about (unless I'm outside).

-I kept protein to about .82 g/lb bodyweight. I replaced the missing protein (according to ifcalc) with carbs.

-I didn't really worry about macros that much; I made sure I was eating enough protein and then just focused on eating a lot more carbs on workout days and a lot more fats on rest days. I didn't worry about hitting 300g carbs/70g fat/etc (though I was pretty close to those targets on most days)

-I eat 2 meals a day on most days, sometimes 1 on rest days. I consume ~60% of my calories post workout.

-I have a sweet tooth and eat a lot of snacks - cookies, cupcakes, piroulines, CHEESECAKE, etc.

-I made sure I ate a lot of vegetables and drank a lot of water every day (~128 oz). I recently started eating more fruits, but didn't really eat much for the first 4 months.

-Workout routine: 

 Tuesday - Squat (RPT), OHP (RPT), Accessory (Usually Inclined DB Press, BW Chinups)

 Thursday - Bench (RPT), Goblet Squats or Turkish Getups (Not RPT), Weighted Dips (RPT)

 Saturday - Deadlift (RPT), Weighted Chins (RPT), DB Rows (Not RPT)

 I recently started doing 10 minute cardio sessions on Sundays (for health, not fat loss) - burpees and kb swings. I didn't do any cardio during my recomp.

 All RPT exercises are done for 5, 6 and 7 reps (except dips - I try to do 8, 10 and 12 for those).

-Staple foods: naan, chicken, hummus, spinach, pomegranate seeds, cereal/milk, QUEST BARS (best snack), nonfat ham, low-calorie bagel thins/tortillas, variety of sweets. I eat fish about 1x/week.

-I drink green/black tea every morning. I don't take any other supplements (I need to start taking some vitamin d3, though).

-I usually get around 7 hours of sleep/night (at least 6).

-I've probably had about 1 cheat meal every two weeks on average, which includes eating almost an entire large Chicago deep dish pizza (in 2 hours). I see a lot of posts asking how to respond to an unexpected cheat meal; seriously, don't worry about them. They mean nothing.

Thanks again to these awesome subreddits/Martin Berkhan/Andy Morgan (for all their articles). I really appreciate all the free information. I mostly just wanted to provide further evidence that leangains works.

1344385292.0,638,self.Fitness,xupyn,I was told you guys might be interested... for those interested in a sprint program or just getting faster (x-post from r/running),833,195,151,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/xupyn/i_was_told_you_guys_might_be_interested_for_those/,"It seems there have been a few people interested in sprinting and getting faster on r/running, olympic track and field is in full swing, and a few people have sent me requests.  So I thought I would post an example program I used in high school track to improve from an 11.1 to a 10.55 in the 100 meter dash over my junior and senior year.  I compiled the program over about a year, and that was four years ago so there isn’t cutting edge stuff here, but it is a start.  I combined exercises from my coaches as well as from “leaked” work outs from collegiate and professional sprinters like Walter Dix, Maurice Green, and even Tyson Gay.  Obviously it is impossible to tell if these sources are credible, but it worked for me so maybe it can work for you!  I think you should lift using the leg work out three times a week and the upper body workout twice a week.  Although Olympians lift before they run, I suggest you do the opposite.  Also, make sure you do a nice dynamic warm up before you run.  Perform each workout as much as you want, but I would suggest doing each of the plyometric, agility, and a speed/conditioning workout twice a week if you want the most gains.  I would also throw in sprinting on small declines around 3-5 degrees, sprinting with a weighted sled/parachute, and lastly running, hopping, and lunging up bleachers.  Alright, here we go.

**Workout One:**  Perform these in the 4-8 rep range (pick four of these lifts and alternate the other four every other lifting day). Snatch, Dead lift, Clean and jerk, Power shrugs (very heavy), One leg alternating hamstring curls, Seated calf raises, Hip abduction/adduction machine, Quad Extensions.

**Workout Two:**  Do this work out once or preferably twice a week, and on days you do not do the workout above.  10-12 rep range.  Dumbbell bench press, Dumbbell military press, Lat pull downs, Bicep curls, Triceps extensions, Forearm curls, Stationary running with dumbbells(very light weight for 3x 1 min.), Core Work.

**Squat Program:**  You need to squat three times a week.  Period.  Do it on the days you do the leg workout above.  The percentages are from your one rep max before you start the program, then sets, and then reps.  Repeat the program when you finish with about a week of very light squats in between to let your legs recover.
Week 1:  80%x2x6, 80%x3x6, 80%x2x6, Week 2:  80%x4x6, 80%x2x6, 80%x5x6, Week 3:  80%x2x6, 80%x6x6, 80%x2x6, Week 4:  85%x5x5, 80%x2x6, 90%x4x4, Week 5:  80%x2x6, 95%x3x3, 80%x2x6, Week 6:  100%x2x2, 80%x2x6, 105%x1.

**Plyometrics:**  Do the following for 3 sets of 40 meters… Ankling, Heel raises (butt kicks), Alternating L&amp;R fast leg cycles, Double Cycles LL&amp;RR, Continuous L&amp;R cycles, Skips for height, Skips for distance, Straight leg bounds, One leg hops. Do the following for 3 sets of 30 reps… Tuck jumps, Box jumps, Rocket jumps (standing broad jump), Lunge jumps (vertical only), Squat jumps, Reaching lunge, One-leg reach (Set an object that is 12 inches tall two feet in front of you.  While standing on one leg with your knee bent reach for the object as fast as you can with the hand on the same side of the leg on the ground.  Sounds simple, but it’s a great exercise.), Hop back and forth over a line- 3 x 1 min., Hop side to side over a line- 3 x 1 min.

**Agility:**  Alternate sprinting and jogging 15m each- 4 x 60m, W-drill (6 sets), Pro-agility drill (6 sets), Three cone drill (6 sets), Sprints- 6 x 10m, 5 x 20m, 4 x 30m, 3 x 40m, 2 x 50m, 1 x 60m (repeat all sprints).  These should all be done below about 80-85 percent of your max heart rate.

**Speed/Conditioning:**  Perform these like you would if you were running a race w/ FULL recovery in between (within ≈15% percent of your resting heart rate).  250m, 200m, 170m, 135m, 100m, 75m, 50m.

**Alternate Conditioning:**  Perform these at about 80 or 90 percent of your max speed.  Try to stay around 75% max heart rate.  8 x 150m, OR 6 x 200m.

5’8”, 21

Start  (June 8, 2010): 200 lbs, unknown body fat

Now (March 13, 2011): 133.2 lbs, 19-20% body fat (from measurements)

Weight loss chart (nearly daily): [here](http://i.imgur.com/5meC2.png). 


**If you’re interested – **

**On method:**
Calorie restriction. I also cut out bread, pasta, and the like but didn’t go very low carb (usually ~150g/day). I aimed for 100 + g of protein. I recorded all calories into loseit on my phone. As I lost weight my caloric budget per day went from 1500-1300. I was generally over each week by about 1000 calories. Instead of working in cheat days, I tried to live as normally as possible and “cheated” when I was invited out to dinner or something. Also, all the big holidays (Christmas, important birthdays, Thanksgiving), I forgot all and gorged. It’s much more the everyday that matters. 


**On exercise: **
For the first few months I joined a Crossfit box. It was a great way to kick me back into a routine and jumpstart everything. I relocated and started doing yoga (vinyasa) fairly intensely. During this period I lost a steady 10lbs per months until I hit 145. From 145 until 134, it has been very slow. This is partly due to reaching a lower body fat and partly that in the last two months I have had an injury that has allowed me to do very little. I am fairly happy with where I am physically, but would like to lose a little more fat (5lbs), gain more strength &amp; definition, and have 17-18% body fat. This might be a little leaner than the general fitit person’s ideal, but I like that look. Am considering cheat mode (if anyone has advice for women on this, it would be appreciated!).


**On food:**
For a point of reference I spend about $125-150/ week on food. This is by far my biggest expense. I can’t eat much, but I want to like what I do. This amount usually includes the foods below plus eating out once a week. 
Breakfast- oats, banana, fage, coffee

Lunch- salad- chicken, vegetables, balsamic vinegar

Snacks - Fage 2% or 0%, hard boiled eggs, turkey lunch meat

Dinners – salad, salmon fillet, vegetables, chicken stews, etc

Desserts/ treats- fairly rare. Fage 2% or 0% with jams, Starbucks light fraps, low calorie pudding, Pinkberry with fruit, Skinny Cow ice cream cups 

Other foods I like – Kashi go lean cereal, Chipotle salad bowls, smoked salmon, chicken breasts, sashimi, earl grey tea, prosciutto, berries, melon, oranges, omlettes without cheese

Alcohol- cut out almost completely. Very occasionally straight whiskey with a beer. 


**General thoughts:**
I would not have known where to begin without r/fitness and after it started, r/loseit. r/loseit’s original 6 month weigh loss “competition” was a huge motivator for me. I am pretty shy/ introverted and my weight was compounding this. I was also depressed and felt helpless— trapped inside my body. Now, I have more self-confidence and am much happier. I fell off the diet wagon ~3 times for a couple weeks each. It’s shitty to have to re-lose weight, but it helps to think long term. Some weeks are easier than others. I am still working on eating in moderation rather than just avoiding all carb or fat heavy foods.  

If you want, please ask questions. r/fitness gave me a lot and hopefully my experience will help someone else as well. Thanks guys.

For the past 26 years, I've basically had the same bed, but over the weekend I decided to bite the bullet and invest in a top of the line matress.

 After only a few days, my workouts have become much easier. I haven't been tired once this entire week after any of my workouts, the bags/dark circles under my eyes are disappearing, and every morning I have a ton of energy. 


I knew quality of sleep was a factor, but I didn't know my sleep was all that bad. Some days I would feel great, others I would be exhausted/in pain... but now I sleep right through the night. I don't wake up until a few minutes before my alarm goes off, which at that point I have already turned off the alarm since it isn't needed.

Lots of running, paying attention to what I eat, and core workouts. Trying to decide if I want to get more serious on the cardio (just now able to do 5K consistently) or if I want to get more into weight training. Any tips, advice, comments, or other input from you fitness pros?

EDIT: Wow, thanks for the props everybody! It's been a tough couple of months but logging on to see all the support sure makes it worth the work. I like to thank folks personally for offering congratulations but there's just too dang many of you all. Thanks again!

I see a lot of folks asking what I did to start out, so I'll try laying that out. First thing I did before any exercise was change my eating habits - my biggest problem (and it still is) is that I eat constantly. Back in college it was stuff like pizza rolls, mega-buttery popcorn, chips, Cheetos, stuff like that. Coupled with a really sedentary lifestyle I gained like 80-90 lbs. in four years of college. I started by trying out some healthier alternatives and found that unsalted peanuts really helped a lot, both in meeting my protein goals for the day and in being pretty filling and having a nice crunchy texture that I like in my snacks. I understand the flavor is kind of bland for some folks but trying out dry roasted or honey roasted worked for me too. 

Once that was going well I kicked beer and soda, both of which I consumed way too much of. I had the same thing with drinking that I did with eating, so swapped that out with water (I'm doing about 150 oz. a day purely to sate my psychological need for fluid intake) and taking out a can of iced tea when I just need some kind of liquid flavor. Things like lemonade mixes and powdered drink mixes are good for alleviating the blandness of just water, water, water, too. Swapped out the fast food with Subway (Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki FTW!) and did a lot more shopping for groceries at a farmer's market stand near my house,  but still doing plenty of Healthy Choice microwavable dinners for my half-hour lunch at work or for a meal after a workout. Switching to wheat bread and cutting any and all white sauces/dressings out of my diet have helped too, and the only kind of candy I eat now (after dropping my beloved Wild Berry Skittles) is salted nut rolls (which are just too delicious). I still don't schedule out my diet in really hardcore fashion, but more just snack on peanuts and eat only when my hunger warrants a meal (rather than gorge myself at every rumble of my stomach like I used to). I have noticed that my appetite has decreased pretty significantly from six months ago, but the food part is still the trickiest for me.

Once I had the diet part down, I started on the Couch to 5K running challenge, a nifty nine-week regimen that starts you out doing really short runs and gradually builds up to half-hour sessions. This was the biggest difference-maker for me and I can't recommend the regimen highly enough. Any folks who want to check it out can do so here: http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml

Most of my stuff early on was running according to the schedule linked and bodyweight stuff, lots of push-ups, crunches, and bodyweight squats. I downloaded Fitocracy onto my iPhone (which is an AWESOME way to track your workouts, I think) and that's been a great source for workout ideas and for trying out new things. Once I felt that I had a decent grip on strength training, I picked up a pair of dumbbells with interchangeable weights for about $20 at Wal-Mart and have been working my way up to 15 lbs each. I'm expecting to do more stuff with equipment and heavier weights once I have access to my university's wellness center in the next few weeks.

If any of you all are on Fitocracy, my handle is DJKyRo. It'd be great to see some other folks' workouts and get some ideas/feedback from some of the fitness experts on here. Feel free to shoot me your info and I'll give you a follow!

Far and away, the best built guy there.

I looked around and saw one guy who was very lean, maybe a runner, but the rest were men from their thirties to fifties with skinny legs, and round bellies.

I'm a forty-four-year-old beginner. I decided I would lose weight first then start StrongLifts. I've been lifting about six weeks and I look in the mirror and at comparison photos but see no difference except the prior weight loss. I was getting discouraged--I know it's been only a month a half, but you hope for something.

Anyway, here's my realization: I'm never going to be Arnold or even Eugen Sandow. **But** I can better than the chest guy and better than I am now. That's it. I can be the best-built forty-plus guy I know. Even adding a little bit of muscle and losing the rest of my belly will put me in the top ten percent of the men I encounter of any age. It's going to take some work and better consistency, but it's extremely likely.

Any gains you make now to strength, size, or general fitness will already move you into the top tier of the people you work with or run into around town. You probably won't be the best in the world, or even the best in the gym, but you don't have to be. Even looking *somewhat* like Michelangelo's David will make you one of the best developed men most people will regularly meet.

Lose some weight, add some muscle, and you're better. It'll take some time, but in less than a year you can make a vast improvement.  Every time you add a few pounds or an extra rep or two you'll know you're better. When those extra pounds and reps start showing, everyone else will know you're better, too.

If you're getting discouraged like I was, make that your short-term goal: I'm going to lift this much more today, and more tomorrow. I'm going to stop having skinny legs. I'm going to stop having to suck in my gut to button my pants. In one month's time I'm going to be better in some way. You're not going to look like Arnold--you know who he is because he and Ronnie Coleman, and Steve Reeves and whoever are the exceptions. How many guys do you even meet in real life who have physiques like underwear models? But you can still be better than you are now and better than most and it doesn't take years or steroids or great genes, it just takes a little bit of regular effort, tracking your progress, and having a little bit of patience.

For the first year of lifting, I kinda just went to the gym and did random exercises and eventually plateaued on all my lifts because I was not following any program.  Then the entire next year I had a ton of free time and completely dedicated myself.  

I gotta say that the difference between doing alright and doing great is just seriously tracking what weights you are doing and following a good program.  I made the most results on a legs/push/pull split.  Learned everything I know about fitness from youtube, 4chan, and reddit.

This year I have started taking things to the next level and am preparing to enter a bodybuilding competition.  Still pretty small but I really want to get started.

His seemingly boundless energy reserve turned into a black hole that sucked away the life force from anyone who crossed his path. He had always been the Zach Galifianakis of our group of friends. Wild, hilarious and the kind of person that enjoyed getting himself and those around him out of their comfort zones. He was now as fun and memorable as the guy that got lost on the roof for the entire movie. He became ED personifed. Awkward...and sad...and limp. There's only so much support friends can give before they reluctantly and guiltily stop trying so hard. Eventually, as he withdrew from his friends, we withdrew from him.

Six months ago, after a long time of trying to help him get his life back on track, I was finally successful in dragging him to the gym. It was six months of hand holding. Six months of dealing with uncharacteristic pessimism and whining. Six months of sacrificing the efficiency of my own workouts to make sure he was staying engaged and motivated. Six months of frustration at seeing my previously highly motivated and enthusiastic friend struggling to finish every set. In all that time he never went to the gym if I didn't go with him. He never repped to failure unless I pushed him. He never made an obvious effort to gain knowledge about his diet or workout regimen. I gradually stopped calling him to pick him up and take him to the gym. I kind of resigned myself to the idea that past 6 months were a waste of his time and mine. Somewhere along the way I had lost my faith in my friend.

Yet...somewhere along the way he got strong. Mentally and physically. Somewhere along the way he lost the weight. Somewhere along the way he gained his confidence back. The discipline from the gym had no choice but to start leaking into other parts of his life. I hadn't seen him at the gym after I stopped picking him up because he started getting up earlier and going before work. I didn't see any of this.

On Friday, I was tired. It had been a long day and a longer week and I had big plans for the night. I also still needed to get to the gym. I looked for any justification to skip my workout and I found it. As I sat on my couch ""cultivating mass"" and ""reserving my energy"" for that night, I received a call from my friend. I didn't want to pick up because I wasn't in the mood to explain why I had been avoiding him for the past few weeks. I answered anyway.

""Hey buddy.""

""Yoooooo! Where are you, what are you doing?"" He yelled in a tone that I hadn't heard in a very long time. I perked up.

""Nothing, just home relaxing for a bit.""

""Did you go to the gym yet?"" he asked.

""Nah, I'm just gonna skip today. I'm kind of tired and I need to ge-""

""Get dressed, we're going. I'll pick you up in 10 minutes, you slacker."" Click.

What? Slacker? LoL. Stunned and confused. It took me almost a full minute to process the phone call. It wasn't what he said but the way he said it. It got me motivated. I got up, put the ""mass cultivating"" ice cream down and got dressed. He picked me up and we sat in an almost awkward silence the entire way to the gym. In retrospect, it was like the calm before the storm. We got to the gym and put our stuff away in the locker room. He started for the weight area and said:

""C'mon. Try and keep up, I've got a big workout today."" 

I chuckled, curious and amused. 90 minutes later, I wasn't chuckling. I was too busy trying to catch my breath. It was one of the most intense workouts I've had in recent memory. He was helping ME finish the last of my reps. He was telling ME to add that extra weight on that last set. He was yelling Shwarzenegger-accented cheesy motivational lines at ME for fun in between exercises (something I'm usually notorious for doing). At some point during those 90 minutes the veil of resentment that made me unable to see my friend's progress this whole time was lifted. It was staggering to see how much of his former self he'd gotten back.

He drove me back home and as I was getting out of the car I extended my fist in initiation of our normal peace-out fist bump. He extended an open hand instead, expecting a handshake. He gripped my hand with uncomfortable firmness.

""Thanks, man."" As sincere as I've ever heard him. 

""Shut up, asshole"" I replied. And then....we kissed. April Fools! We didn't but it was a pretty bromosexual moment. I left the car with a smile on my face. My friend was back.

TLDR: My friend got divorced, broken and fat. I put him on my back and carried him across the sludgy lake of wallowing and through the dense forest of self-pity. He regained his confidence and his self-sufficient recovery mode.

I made it from 270lbs @ 5'11 http://i.imgur.com/uE69Z.jpg (I know, the horse died) to 180lbs http://i.imgur.com/2yWm0.jpg

The goal now, get to 160lbs.. but I've hit a wall, any suggestions /r/fitness?

Update: Just to shed a little more light on my issue, I've been stuck around the 180ish area for some time now. I try different things, fasting, cardio, juicing etc.. everything seems to work in terms of losing weight, but no visual difference. Which leads me to believe I am doing nothing more than losing water weight. 

In October I deploy to the UAE and was hoping to bring a new workout with me. 

Suggestions?

Update: MEatRHIT

*Weight: 185lbs Height: 5'11 Age: 22 
*Goals: Reduction in body fat %, currently 16-18%
*Injuries: Fixed inguinal hernia (Just gotta take it easy on the squats)
*Did smoke, quit 2 months ago.
*First diet consisted of Salad/Tuna mix with 8 glasses of water daily. 2 mile run daily. Aside from that, I am ignorant to what my needs are.
*Currently active duty USAF, so I have access to a gym with many utilities.

Update:

Thanks for all the supportive replies! One request for anyone out there that can help, I understand that diet seems to be the largest issue when coming to lean gains and fat loss, any nutritionists out there willing to give me a template? Or even better, a plan to follow?

To summarize its conclusions (from the abstract -- I did not examine its analysis or review): 

*  To maximize muscle hypertrophy, 1.2-2.0 grams of protein per kg of body weight, and more than 44-50 kcal/kg of body weight should be consumed daily. 

* Protein supplementation pre- and post- workout increase performance, recovery, lean body mass, hypertrophy and strength. 

* 3-4 grams of leucine during the post-workout meal promote maximum protein synthesis. Also, a fast-acting carb source (maltodextrin, glucose) is needed as leucine cannot modulate protein production without insulin. 

* In contrast, the pre-workout supplements should be essential amino acids (BCAAs) and dextrose. 

* A (weight-lifting) training protocol tailored for muscle hypertrophy and strength should be at least 10–12 weeks in length and involve three to five training sessions weekly, consisting of compound lifts that include both the upper and lower body.

I was in horrible shape, had just come out of a horrendous relationship, and had the final year of my Chinese &amp; Economics degree looming. 

Everything that was physically out of my human control over the last 300 days or so has, by chaotic laws or otherwise, conspired to screw me emotionally, financially and physically - the final plunge of the blade was the passing of someone close to me just the other month. 

Nevertheless, the things *I could control* turned out pretty well (as I willed them to); I performed to a good standard in the degree and am moving to the other side of the world in a few days.

I believe that exercise is nature's finest antidepressant and more soothing than any balm one may find on the shelves of London's most exquisite apothecary.
 
Below are some progress pics (I was very fat before - that isn't muscle underneath, unfortunately). For the first 90 days or so I followed a very strict Paleo diet and very unstrict P90x routine. I then moved onto arbitrariness/fuckarounditis and intermittent fasting where I spent the remainder of my time. My goal was neither to be lean nor big, only to get out of the house and temporarily shelter my mind from the proximal darkness that was ever-present in the baneful years of 2011 - 2012. (I apologise for the horrendous/tacky filter on the middle back pic - I saved over the original.)

With my arbitrary IF routine I sort of [bulked/recomped/whatever'd (PIC)](http://i.imgur.com/0r8S6.jpg) until today. To be honest, I looked as I do now at about day 200; thereafter my days have been fraught with exams, holidays and debauched nights with old friends. I was also frustrated with training because of some ligament damage in my ankle - I haven't been able to work my legs effectively for months and months (trust, I am truly ashamed to have a 300lb 1rm deep squat after so many days - it is my favourite exercise and should be bigger.)

My upper routine is lax - I just focus on form and repeat reps until the muscle is tired. This might be 160kg deadlifts, 90kg palm-forward bentover ez rows, 104kg lat pulldowns, 95kg bench etc. I've had too much going on to obsess over lifts - I just make sure I work regularly. Obviously this has led to months of stalling of which I am 100% aware - I aim to remedy this when I settle in China and begin a real /r/fitness strength program, complete with squatsandoats. Greyskull perhaps, *though your advice would be greatly appreciated.*



&gt;Why Intermittent Fasting? My biggest[ vice is food](http://i.imgur.com/NNF6e.jpg) - I have these odd cravings to eat huge portions of awfully delicious junk food. I also hate breakfast and love Xtend BCAAs. IF harmonises nicely with these aspects.  It allows me to get down to a 6-pac in &lt; 30 days if required, at the expense of minor strength stagnation.

I was also was getting married and being a bridesmaid for my sister. I was really not confident at all about looking good and decided I had to do something about it. So I set about calorie counting and getting into fitness. 13 months later I have lost 80lbs. This takes me into the normal BMI range (I know; don't listen to BMI, but as a fat, relatively unactive woman it was probably quite accurate and psychologically this is a big milestone for me). I am working out regularly. I am pretty close to the point I can do a few pull-ups and I can run without killing myself.

My program is:

*An intake of 1400-1600 cals per day. This is healthy food with occassional treats like home baking. No processed food at all. 

*An hours session with a trainer doing mainly weight training like kettlebells, squats and bodyweight exercises.

*Swimming 1/2 a mile 4 times a week (in the mornings before work)

*Between 0 and 2 other exercise sessions in the week that could be a kettlebell work out or maybe aerobic like running or rowing machine. 

I might loose up to a stone more and I still have some fat to loose, but I am not too bothered about weight now. I am more focussed on my body changing shape and looking more toned. I have some goals in terms of my fitness which include:

*Run a 5k charity race
*Become stronger!

1) **Fat doesn't magic itself into existence:** The various molecules that make up the bajillion fat cells spread across your body don't warp into existence from an alternate universe, as strange as that may seem. If you're gaining weight, then you're almost certainly eating too much. Or you're drinking way more water than you used to and have gained some water weight.

If you have actually increased your water intake, then a couple of lbs can be ignored. Otherwise, you're eating too much. My uncle warned me about dieting yesterday saying that if I started to eat very litte, I would get fatter because my body would store more and more of what I ate as fat. I didn't have my physics bat handy. If the universe worked like that, anorexics wouldn't exist.

[Fix yo' shit](http://deflab.me/)

2) **If your diet is temporary, then your weight loss will be temporary:** Your body will adjust to the incoming nutrients available and energy ouput required. If you go on a temporary diet to cut a few pounds, your body will shed some fat to make up for it until it stabilizes at a level where its energy output is equal to your caloric input. If you ""end"" your diet and go back to pre-diet food levels, then BAM, your body works to adjust again, by adding fat.

3) **""Blips"" in your diet/exercise mean nothing.**: If the world is going to end on Dec 23 2012, you've got 356 days to get your shit together and look *fabulous* at the End of the World party. Let's say you plan on eating 1800 calories every day till the end of the world. Now let's say you find out that somebody else stole your costume idea for the End of the World party, and you eat 1800 calories + 3 pints of Chunky Monkey every day for the next week.

You might think you fucked up bad, right?

Your avg calories for the year went from 1800 to 1817.

If you fail once in a while(and unless you're some kind of robot, or you live light years away from a Cinnabon, you will), just flip the bird to obesity and get the fuck back to your diet the next minute. It's the long term that counts, so don't get disheartened by occasional mistakes.

And if you use my last point as an excuse to eat all the icecream you want then fuck you. I said occasional.

This applies to exercise as well. Jogging once a week ain't gonna do shit unless you want to lose like...3lbs (aka the weight xtc46 loses during his morning dump). Shove some physical activity into your schedule daily.

I was recently asked by friends state-side for a progress update of my fitness endeavours. Upon comparing with a before photo I randomly found, I was quite pleasantly surprised. Did I say quite? My god, I was fucking ecstatic.

Ladies (and sure gents), the difference 10lbs can make: http://i.imgur.com/b7rqN.jpg

**Edit:** Here's a similar pose as the before picture: http://i.imgur.com/IyDWu.jpg

And can you believe I've been working out for ~2 years _before_ that before shot?? Yes. My routine/diet sucked: 5days per week, doing the traditional split: chest/tri, back/bi, legs, shoulders, arms (day filler). Doing 3 sets of 8-12 reps.

It wasn't until ~Oct. (I believe) I picked up on SS/SL and ran with SL5x5. I did SL5x5 up until 3 weeks ago when I switched to 5/3/1 + BW accessories due to stalling and change of goals. My maxes on SL5x5:

* Bench Press: 175x4
* Squat: 225x5 (then fall back to sub 220 for some reason)
* OHP: 105x3
* Row: 165x5
* Deadlift: 305x3

In between SL5x5 days (Tu/Th), I did supplemental exercises that complemented what I did the day before, all with reps in 15-20 range. No running. The couple last months, I've started Crossfit on Sat. mornings.

Now, I didn't notice very much change in the early cycle until I made a couple changes to my daily routine. For starters: I stopped eating out for lunch, and now use my post-shake as my ""lunch."" And I moved gym time from after work to lunch. No more shitty lunches+never skipping gym to go out after work == new routine that I use to this day. I also added eggs as my second breakfast for some added protein, fats, and calories.

I was happy with my weight, but wanted more mass. And being that I now live on a bloody tropical island, I had to remain lean (/vain). So, I intentionally aimed for a slow gain. It's a (edit) self-created diet borrowing some ideas from LeanGains (1 meal, 10g bcaa).  My daily routine for weekdays:

* 7:30am: Shake - whole milk + whey, 5g bcaa, 5g fiber, and AM multivitamin
* 9:30am: 4 eggs at work
* 12pm: gym (on and off pre- such as whiteflood and jack3d with 5g bcaa), SizeOn as my workout drink.
* 1:30pm: Post-workout shake - whole milk + weight gainer (currently [pro complex gainer](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/gainer.html)), 5g creatine, 5g bcaa
* 3:30pm: A random snack high in protein, sometimes a salad - something to tide me over.
* 6pm: chicken/pork/steak/hamburger/etc with v8 as my veggie serving, and PM multivitamin
* 8pm: Shake - whole milk + whey
* 10:30p: Shake - whole milk + casein and ZMA

Weekends, not as many shakes (no weight gainer), and meals are sporadic, and not gorging. Now, I understand my diet may be a factor in my stalls -- I'm alright with that. I'm still tweaking, to this day, adding things here and there. Lean gains are what I'm after, even if it sacrifices strength.

So, there you have it. 1 year, +10lbs, from slob to (amateur) chippendale.

**Edit 2** Answers to a couple common questions: I'm 35, turning 36 at the end of Sept. My ab routine consists of planks and ab-wheel rollouts (mostly ab-wheel) on Tu/Th.

You don't have to be a victim anymore.  It can end today.  You don't have to give into the mental disorders that your brain, the internet, and doctors keep telling you that you have.  You don't have to be weak anymore.  You don't have to be overweight.
  
Whatever got you to this point, it doesn't matter.  Let go of any excuses you've ever had.  Seriously.  Whatever they are, they are irrelevant.  This is your only guaranteed life.  Are you going to let it go by like this?  Is this how you really picture yourself?  You don't have to be this way.  You can change, starting today.  
  
Did the guy at the beginning of Oblivion whine about how he got to where he was?  No, he acknowledged he was Level 1, got his shit, and started walking towards the nearest mountain.  
  
DO NOT think of the mountain ahead of you.  Think of each day as a step.  One step at a time is all you have to do.  Promise that you will be a better person tomorrow, and make it true.  Exercise today and do *something*.  Eat *less* today.  You don't have to be perfect, but you do have to be better.  And you have to get better every day, and that's it.  
  
Sometimes you will fail, and that's OK, as long as you acknowledge that you've failed and hold yourself accountable.  This isn't about being perfect.  It's about your good decisions vastly outnumbering your bad.  This is a game of golf, and if you just finish most days at/under par, that bogey or two isn't going to kill your score.
  
You didn't get out of shape in a week, or even a few months.  And you might not get beautiful in a few months.  It might take a year.  But won't it be worth it?  It's something you can do.  And it's not that complicated; it's just hard.  
  
Eat less.  Do more.  You must eat less.  Exercise alone won't offset enormous amounts of calories.  If you rely on your instincts alone, you will fail.  You must use your higher judgement, and when that feeling of hunger hits you, understand that is your body consuming everything you hate about it.  
  
Take pictures of yourself every week, minimum, because the changes will be so slow that you won't notice them.  But the camera will.  
  
And lastly, intensity when exercising.  Fuck everything you've ever heard about 'fat-burning zone'.  Intensity, but not to the point of injury.  If you aren't sweating and out of breath, your doing it wrong.  If you can carry on a conversation, fuck that.  Your body doesn't want to change.  It likes itself just the way it is.  You have to give it a reason to change.  If you noticed I misused the word 'your' then fuck you, do ten push-ups.
  
Good luck.

No, listen. There's really not. Look at countries that don't have hot excess carbs available 24/7 to be shoved down your throat. How many individuals are obese there? Exactly: far less than 0.1%.

Shut up, shut up, shut up. If we were all prisoners of the environment we grew up in, I'd be a 250 lbs. Jehovah's Witness living in a trailer park. But I'm not. You know why? Because I realized that being dirt poor sucks, being fat sucks, and being religious sucks. So I decided that when I grew up, I wasn't going to be those things. And I'm not.

If you are fat, it almost certainly through your own weakness. It's on the same level as claiming that you can't get a girlfriend because of your Aspergers. It's that fucking retarded and offensive to that tiny minority of people who really do have problems.

It's not rocket science: humans weren't meant to eat ridiculous amounts of processed carbs. Humans weren't meant to sit around all day. Stop doing those things, and you can eventually not be fat. You didn't get fat in a month, and you won't get un-fat in a month. It might take a year or two. Suck it up, and take it one day at a time. It's simple, really.

Eat less calories. Yes, this might not be easy. But it's simple. Just stop. If you don't have the willpower, then that's not an excuse. Many of us find the willpower, even in tough and stressful circumstances, so you don't have an excuse.

Exercise. I don't care what you do. No fucking excuses. *""But I hurt my...""*--- shut up. Do something. Figure it out.

Either live your life as a victim, always blaming others for your problems. Or grow up, and be a real person who takes responsibility for themselves and their problems. And then fixes them.

No more 'fat tolerance'. It's gone too far.  
  
**(edit: GOOD LORD.  I post a rant half asleep, pass out, and wake up to find that I have kicked a hornet's nest and my Redditstock is somewhere between the Penguin from Batman Returns and Superman 64.  I will do my best to respond and reply, but there's a lot of you.  I will say this though, in general: sometimes it's time to stop the coddling.  Sometimes we all need some hatefully tough love.)**  
  
*(edit 2: You don't think I like McDonald's too?  But when I saw my mid-section getting bigger and bigger... I stopped.  Don't be a victim.  We are all humans here; be better than that.  If you are fat and working on it, then good for you.  This post wasn't aimed at you; you are improving.  If every day you are a little better than the day before, awesome.  If you have a verified thyroid problem, guess what - you are the 0.1%, but that still doesn't excuse you from doing your best.  If all the different mental medication you are on, and the lack of therapy that you need is also making you fat... I don't even know.  That's just sad.  I hope to see the day when you can be off all those meds and stop allowing yourself to be a victim.)*  
  
**(edit 3: ""Just let them live their lives.  It doesn't affect you, or anyone else.  Stop being such an asshole.""**  
  
But here's the problem.  It does affect other people.  It affects all of us.  From the trivial issues of stepping around the 500 lbs. woman on the scooter at Wal-Mart, to the bigger issue of feeling for her poor daughter who is loading the cart with Oreo's, Ice Cream, and Frozen Pizza and is going to have a shit headstart on life because her mom is telling her that she's beautiful just the way she is, and it's in her 'blood' to be fat.  Social healthcare in America is growing every day, so everyone else's fat IS mine and your problem now.   Don't say that it's their life, because that just feeds into the problem even more, and makes it that-much-more alright to be so fat and inactive)

EDIT: So originally I just intended this post as a bit of an introduction of sorts, but I guess I should have thought it out more and included more detail. So I'll do it now. Sorry about that.

Diet:I Stick strictly to the 5-6 evenly sized meals a day plan, no matter what, and even on ""cheat days"" I use portion control to maintain that schedule. I eat mostly fruits and Vegetables, grilled chicken, turkey, and fish, I mix in brown rice and beans too. I find that hot sauce is my best friend on this diet. I do drink a protein shake after workouts, I buy a different one every time usually, to get some verity.  So for example today I had blueberries and oatmeal for breakfast, a protein shake with a banana for my second meal, grilled chicken, brown rice and a cup of mixed vegies for lunch, grapes, carrots, and celery for my 4th, spinach and turkey enchiladas for dinner and an apple and a nectarine for my 6th

For my workout routine I work my schedule for lifting like this; I do 1 muscle group a day focus, Monday chest, Tuesday back, Wednesday legs, Thursday shoulders, Friday arms. I pick 6 or 7 exercises for each and change them out every 4 weeks or so. I start with 3 sets of 4 reps as much weight as I can, working for 5 then 6 reps all the way to 8 then add weight and repeat. I take 90 seconds break between sets, and go for a 2 second motion  count in each direction for most movements. 
For cardio, I run/jog 3 days a week, 40-60 minutes, and do boxing or karate 3 days a week. Sundays I don't do anything,lifting or cardio, and every 5th week I usually lighten or almost completely eliminate my workout routine for a ""rest week"" 

A couple of you have mentioned that I'm over training? I don't know if I am, I'm not an expert, but I have had pretty good results so far, how would you recommend I modify my routine?

I've also been asked for a chest picture, to see if those man boobs are gone, so here's that http://imgur.com/lyywe

A lot of questions about loose skin, Yes I have it, and at first I had a lot of it, I lost 50lbs in the first 3 months, it seamed like once it started, it wouldn't stop coming off. The skin is still Loose but it definitely is shrinking.

Someone else wants a diagnosis for a mystery back pain that shoots down his leg after he screwed the pooch on a deadlift attempt.

**FITTIT IS NOT A RESOURCE FOR MEDICAL ADVICE, PEOPLE!!** 

I'm sure that in the whole of r/fitness, there is a doctor in the house, but even they will only be able to give an educated guess, at best, without a proper examination. 

If you want to lose weight, get stronger, gain mass, or run farther, we have an app for that.

tl;dr: if you think you have a medical condition, go see a doctor. If you know you have a medical condition, listen to your doctor. If you don't like what he's told you, go see another doctor.  No jackass on the internet, including myself is mentally or physically capable of diagnosing or treating moderate to severe injuries/illnesses over the internet.

**EDIT:** A few commenters have pointed out that maybe the OPs of my most hated posts can't afford a doctor. I understand this, I really do, but that isn't the point....the point is that if you must go to the internet for medical advice or self diagnosis/treatment, go to a website that specializes in that sort of thing...I put the alternative in the post title for shit's sake.

After feeling crappy all the time and having low self-esteem I began running and working out while not really trying to eat healthier. I was still hovering around 200lbs until last year when I came across the intermittent fasting protocol. I essentially followed ""Leangins"" pretty closely with drastic change in my diet - I ate less carbs and fat. Around the same time I started lifting using the reverse pyramid scheme. I would basically fast for 16 hrs and eat in an 8 hour window and work out 3 days per week focusing on heavy lifts as listed below. For supplements I relied on ON Whey, BCAA, jack3d and creatine. As compared to last year when I started this new system I've increased my bench max from 225x1 rm to 310x1 rm; deadlift 315x1rm to 415x1rm; squat 275x1rm to 350xrm. Dips around +145lbs weight for 5 reps. Pull-ups +90lb weighted 3-4 reps. Now at 28, I weigh 175 lbs at 5'8, with 12-14% bf (still have ways to go).

And I said to him that I don't really like associating myself with people who don't want to better themselves, specifically overweight people, who would rather buy a meal at McDonalds than put that money towards a gym membership. Has anybody else experienced any biases since making progress, or am I just a douche?

EDIT: I feel like I must say that, it's not about CUTTING people off, it's just not wanting to hang out with them to participate in unhealthy activities, if these people want to play a sport or something, hell yeah I'm down, but if they want to sit and eat fattening food and watch movies, it turns me off from wanting to be around them, not saying that I wouldn't want to enjoy a movie night with my friends, but I'm going to work that junk food off, they aren't. I don't know, I feel like I'm trying to live through other people, but I should just let them do what makes them happy. 

CONCLUSION!: It seems that everyone on here bashing me for openly stating that I have a bias for overweight people who don't do anything about it, are the ones who haven't gone through the long process of better one's health. And everyone that HAS made weight loss/gain/health progress, said in their comments, that they too, had feelings and thoughts similar to the ones I initially stated. So yes, in general, people who've made progress do feel a certain way about others who do not want to better themselves, though we need to get rid of those emotions/opinions/feelings, they are without question there. 

And the majority of conclusions have been that I am seeing my past self in those people that I judge, and that is true, I do, and that is why I want to help them become healthier, because I know how they feel, where they are, and I know how good I can help them to feel.

Method:

Went mountain biking with colleagues and was disgusted by how unfit I'd become. Ten years of junk, booze, and ill shit had taken their toll. The last 5 years of office work had made fat and lazy. So I looked into how I could improve my fitness... I started by following Starting Strength for 3 months. Changed from a commercial gym to a hardcore strongman/powerlifting gym housed in a barn near me and began 5.3.1. Followed this with the Big But Boring template for about another 7 months, but worked it in around training for the Tough Mudder in July. Lifted 3 days a week and ran 3 days a week. I built up the running by doing hill sprints on rest days from lifting, when I could do 3 sets of 5 sprints I tried running 2 miles, which went OK, and gradually built up my mileage from there. Then I started running up a local mountain called Bennachie on Friday nights, keeping up with the same colleagues who had beasted me so badly mountain biking only a few months earlier. For the last couple of months I've been doing my own workout plan, using the knowledge I've gained over the last year about how my body responds and fitness in general, it's basically Stronglifts but I do different rep/ set schemes. I can't run as much due to an achilles problem so I'm swimming and biking more.

Diet:

I don't do anything special, just try to avoid foods I know are obviously bad for me at least 80% of the time and try to get a balanced diet. Was taking protein shakes and creatine for a while but I'm just eating regular food now and not noticing any real difference. I think major gains are to be made in this area for me, I'm still carrying a lot of fat I think.

Conclusion:

Pretty mediocre physique change compared to some folks I've seen on here, but I'm not going mental on the diet and I'm in my 30's now, the body takes longer to respond. That said, I feel awesome and I've done really cool, fun things like the Tough Mudder and a Spartan race...I'm running up mountains for fun and lifting weights that would have broken me in two a year ago. The point is that my physical fitness and mental wellbeing are significantly improved and my horizons have expanded, my goal was never to become a fitness model.

My philosophy is as long as every week I'm a wee bit better in some aspect and able to do something I couldn't before then I'm doing it right.

In the next year I want to really get a grip on the diet side of things and work on my lift numbers, as well as knocking an hour or so off that Tough Mudder time.

A few nice locals showed me how to swing on them and I've been hooked ever since.

What most ""ringers"" (as they are colloquially known) do is travel from one ring to another by pulling with their arms, swinging their legs, twisting their hips and letting go - keeping one hand on a ring at a time. It's amazing fun and totally open to creativeness. There are no official rules. You can also use them for muscle ups, pull ups, leg raises, etc.

After 6 months of working out on the rings (about 2-3 times per week) I've noticed a drastic difference in the way I look and feel. **I don't lift any weights (besides my own body weight) or follow any strict diet**. The only other exercise I do is mild cycling to get around the city. 

I am very passionate about this now. It is my dream to see more of these rings built around the world so people of all ages can have fun and get in shape. For that reason I've set up a website with some more info and videos to help promote it. This might be a shameless plug but I am not making money from this. If I end up raising money in the future every dollar would go toward building more and teaching people how to use them.

If you're in LA you can find two sets of rings by the pier in Santa Monica.
In New York they are in Riverside Park by 105th street and the Hudson River/West Side Highway.

I mean I really love it. The only cheat food that will stray me from my diet is pizza.. So I came up with this recipe for a truly healthy pizza that has almost no carbs besides fiber and is very high in protein. Just the crust alone has 50 grams of protein before adding any chicken. 

**Ingredients:**

* 3/4 cup flax seed meal
* 1 scoop unflavored whey protein
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
* 1 teaspoon oregano
* 1/2 tablespoon of Splenda
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 eggs
* 1/4 cup water

**Nutrition:**

Whole crust has 4 grams of effective carbohydrates, 26 grams fiber, 49 grams protein, 65 grams healthy fats, and 745 calories.

**Preparation:**

* Preheat oven to 425
* Mix dry ingredients together.
* Add wet ingredients, and mix very well.
* Let sit for about 5 minutes to thicken.
* Spread on pan into a round 12 inch pie
* Bake for 15-17 minutes until cooked through, then add toppings and cook until they are done.

**Topping Options:**

* I always spread a thin layer of 100% organic, salt-free, tomato sauce.
* Use fat free cottage cheese. I know it sounds crazy but it really does taste fine and it's super healthy.
* Typical toppings that I use include chicken breast, onions, mushrooms, ground turkey, and pineapple.

**EDIT**

I ran out of unflavored whey, so I used a scoop of Raw Meal protein instead.

Doesn't taste bad at all with tuna.. But I still prefer my usual with grilled chicken and onions

I'm a lurker, never really posted much but am in need of some fitness help.

Currently I work out at the gym 3 times a week focusing on weight loss mainly with weights added. I split my weight groups but do 25minutes of crosstrainer cardio every time I go to the gym.

My gym is quite limited you could say, in terms of cardio equipment. We have treadmills, exercise bikes, cross-trainers and pull-rowers. I cant really do exercise bikes or pull-rowers because I get this weird pinch just above my right knee and it prevents me from doing those exercises for more than 2-3 minutes.

I guess my question is; what are some effective cardio workouts I can do so I don't get bored with just crosstrainer?

Thanks for any suggestions.

1332608530.0,572,self.Fitness,rbjt5,Ten things I've discovered in five years of self coaching. (very long),754,182,139,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rbjt5/ten_things_ive_discovered_in_five_years_of_self/,"Five years ago I was 250 pounds and a flight of stairs was a serious obstacle. I made changes, I kept at it and things are exponentially better today. I read a lot, I tried many, many different things and I talked with anyone else who was on the same journey. This is what I've learned:

1.	Don’t buy in. It’s hard to stay objective, especially if you’re really excited about being in on the next big thing in fitness. Buying into one program, one tool or one training philosophy limits both your receptiveness to other ideas and your objectiveness about the results you’re getting. This is the biggest mistake people make. They think one program or magic device or rainforest berry extract will solve all their problems and give them the body of their dreams. When it fails they always look at themselves as a victim of genetics instead of a victim of advertising hype. Or worse, they blame themselves. Then they give up all together. There is no one single thing that does it all and there is no one single perfect program. 

2.	Don’t do too many things at once. You’ve probably heard of at least one program that claims you can be bigger, faster, stronger, last longer, out jump, out play, on and on, etc. etc. They never live up to it. Focus on what you need most. Are you in bad shape? Overweight? Concentrate on DIET, basic strength and endurance before you worry about developing the flactiod, its role in power production and the hundred other things in the muscle magazine you bought. Need to run faster? Find a running program. Need to be stronger? Use a strength program. Need both? Find something that balances them. Need to be a ninja, wrapped in a navy seal, combined with a marathoner, crossed with a powerlifter and topped off with a 45 inch vertical leap? Good luck. 

3.	Keep recovery in mind. Remember, you have to get enough rest to recover from EVERYTHING you do, not just your workout. Hitting the clubs until 2 a.m. isn’t recovery. Sleeping nine hours is. If your program AND lifestyle don’t account for this it’s simply too much, too soon, too often. You will fail. Find a different program or different hobbies. You’re not Wolverine, you don’t recover faster than anyone else. Quit kidding yourself about this.

4.	Don’t worry about a bad workout. Don’t worry about a week of bad workouts. Don’t scrap a program that was working because of a week of bad workouts. Worry about a bad month. Change things up if you hit two bad months but evaluate why it failed first. There’s a possibility that one simple thing could have fixed everything. 

5.	KISS. Keep It Simple Stupid. This reflects some of rule 2, however you can be way too complicated while trying to do one thing at a time. No one needs to do flat, incline, decline bench press, pec flies, skull crushers and tricep kickbacks in the same workout to build either size or strength. It’s actually detrimental to most people. If you can do 30 reps of that many upper body exercises then you didn’t use enough weight. You spent a lot of recovery capitol for little benefit. People do this all the time and get nowhere. Stop it.

6.	DDSS. Don’t Do Stupid Shit. This should be obvious, but it isn’t. Breaking your leg is bad for you and negatively affects your training. Minor injuries are not quite as bad for you, but often have just as detrimental effects to your training. Especially if you don’t get them treated or try to push through them like most people. Use good form. Use sane weights. Don’t let your ego bait you into stupid competitions in the weight room. Let friendly games of whatever stay friendly. Stop being stupid.

7.	Give up Elite and embrace not being so. Are you over 20? 25? 30? Yes? Are you competing on a world stage in the sport of your choice? No? Then I have some bad news for you. Sure, I’m a pessimist. Sure, I’m an asshole. Odds are though, I’d be doing you no favors by telling you that if you did some program cooked up by an NFL Strength and Conditioning coach and closed your eyes and wished really hard and practiced every day that you could be the next Vince Papale. What you’ll probably end up is disillusioned and back on the couch with a six pack and Doritos. You’re not an elite athlete. Train like a beginner, then train like an intermediate athlete, then maybe train like an advanced one. But stop stealing programs from Olympic training camps. Once you do you’ll actually make some progress and have some real victories to celebrate and you might amaze yourself one day. Until you give up the fantasy of suddenly appearing on a world stage out of nowhere you’re doomed to repeat burn out after burn out. And for those rare exceptions that do make it, I would argue that on some level they understood and applied this.

8.	Often the best program, and the best diet, is simply the one you’ll stick to. If you can barely live without bread, how well do you think you’ll do on the Adkin’s diet? Be honest about this. The momentum you lose from failing like this is awful. The same goes for programs, do you dislike running more than a mile? Why would you do Couch to 5K? Hate the big box gym scene? Why join one? This should be covered under Rule 6 but so many people waste time repeatedly setting themselves up for failure that it gets its own entry. If you quit doing it, it’ll never work. Find something you can do consistently.

9.	Read books on the subject. Actual books. E-books are okay, but the point is that it’s a BOOK. People ask me about programs some times. It’s part of my job now. It’s not what I get paid for, but its part of my job. That’s all you need to know about that. I ask them where they got the program. If it comes from a muscle mag or a website that sells supplements you need to evaluate it very closely because it could be crap. If it comes from an internet forum post and isn’t stolen from someone else it’s invariably crap. If people have taken the time to have it published and the author isn’t famous for revealing a nice midriff and it doesn’t make you violate some of the first eight rules, it might be a good program. This isn’t absolute but it can be a damn good guideline. There’s a lot of information on the internet, but not all of it is good. In fact, most of it is crap. Be wary.

10.	Don’t make your own program. This seems to contradict Rule 9, but not when you remember Rule 7. Yes, those books will educate you on programming and other things you should learn so you can spot a stinker program but they won't make you a coach. Reading a few books doesn’t make you a Rippetoe, Pavel or Dan John. Decades of experience as both athlete and coach does. I cringe whenever I hear someone say something like “XXXX Program is good but for someone in my situation you need to change…” What situation? You can’t squat? Learn. Can’t do this or that? Can you learn to? Are you injured? No? Don’t jack with the program. You’re not qualified to. It’s not necessary either. The only people who need a custom program are people dealing with a long term debilitating injury, like a missing limb. Everything else can be taught, learned or fixed so you can do the program as written. It may take years and doctors, but it can happen. And you should make it happen. Those names and the programs associated with them are popular for a reason. Results.

* Fix yo' [sleep cycle timing](http://sleepyti.me/)

Remember, exercise is stress. It may be eustress, eventually beneficial, but it is still stress on your body. In fact, what you call ""getting fitter"" is basically your body saying ""Aw poop, I gotta divert  some resources to deal with this shit that keeps happening to me."". That's why consistency is so important. If you only perform significantly stressful exercise once a month, the stress on your body is going to be too small to see significant gains any time soon. That's also why you have to keep increasing the weights, otherwise once your body gets used to the weights, it's just gonna chill.

You have to give your body the resources to deal with the stress though. Otherwise, your body has to cut resources from somewhere else, or if it can't, it'll just not do that much to adjust to the stress. Food is the more obvious resource, but sleep is just as important. Check this [infographic](http://i.imgur.com/K8qsn.jpg). In particular, I'd like you to look at the average sleep of those famous athletes. 

What are you waiting for? I just gave you some reasons to eat and sleep more. Get to it!

EDIT: Apparently some people in this subreddit think posts should spell every single detail out so that a mentally handicapped chinese kid who was kidnapped by russians who taught him english and then sold him to egyptians to be raised as a farm boy should be able to figure out the whole damn thing.

OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GAIN MUSCLE/STRENGTH BY JUST EATING AND SLEEPING. OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO LIFT TO STRESS YOUR BODY TO BEGIN WITH.

It's not really surprising. Humans have known about this phenomenon for thousands of years. After all, how do you think beef jerky is made?

* [My Transformation Thesis](http://foodisforfuel.com/2012/01/my-transformation-thesis/)


Someone on a forum asked me if there was going to be a time when I would start to worry about gaining weight for an entire month. He wasn't trying to be rude but rather just asking a legitimate question. I thought for a moment and began to reply. An hour later, I ended up with what I believe is the best and most important piece I've ever written. It's my transformation thesis. I've been asked over the course of the last year multiple times when I'm going to write a book. The problem is that I don't need the full length of a book to solve for obesity. Anything else I'd put in a book would be filler to justify the price.

In the Hitch Hiker's guide when supercomputer ""Deep Thought"" is asked to solve the Ultimate Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything, it takes the computer 7 1/2 million years to come up with the answer, which is 42. I feel like if you paid for that service, you should get your money back. The same problem exists whenever I think about writing about my solution for obesity. The answer is, ""Stop being obese.""

I realized today that I'll never be able to write a book about this because I can tell you how to transform yourself into the person you want to be in under 15 pages. I might be able to do it under 10.

I'm eating healthy food, supplementing creatine, on testosterone replacement therapy, and taking thyroid medication now. I'm also taking thermogenic compounds like caffeine, green tea extract, and on my second month of a three month Phentermine cycle. I'm now working every day for 9+ hours a day and moving around way more often than I did while I steadily losing weight and sitting on my ass reading forums. I'm working out regularly and doing CrossFit, which leaves me drained like nothing else I've ever done before.

I'm gaining weight. I'm even happy with that weight gain.

The guy on the forum made me think. Why am I not worried that much about gaining weight? The past 2 years of my life have been about losing weight. [My blog](http://www.foodisforfuel.com) was born because I got good at losing weight. Lots of people on the Internet know of the name ""Vainglory"" now because I lost all of that weight. So, why am I not freaking out when I'm gaining weight? My entire identity revolves around it, including my new job. Won't this ruin everything? I don't think so.

So I'm gaining weight. I'm not that worried about it. The normal response for most people would be to decrease their caloric intake because they'd panic. My natural -- thoroughly indoctrinated -- inclination is to do that as well, especially because there's now a bunch of people watching my progress. However, I'm quite calm and actually increasing my caloric intake and I'll explain why.

Throughout the past 2 years, I've never gotten enough calories. I started at a deficit and I kept it up. That's why I was able to lose 5 pounds a week some weeks, or more. The only reason I considered it a ""healthy loss"" was because I was gigantic and any weight -- including muscle -- that I could take off was more healthy than being at that weight.

I got rid of knee pain, back pain, foot pain, joint pain, mental pain, and went from a cynical and overtly defensive waste of oxygen to existing in a kind of extended state of nirvana.  I felt warmth and at peace with myself, like how you'd feel when you solve a puzzle you've been staring at for 28 years. It's not the weight loss that gave me that but through gaining confidence and control over my situation.  Like how Goose would have felt if he had pulled he and Maverick out of the flat spin instead of ejecting himself into a solid plate of fiberglass like a junebug into the windshield of a soccer mom's minivan on a dusty back road.

That's the diet and fitness industry and what's inherently wrong with it. You are a number and not a person with natural human weaknesses. Each person who goes on the Biggest Loser is subjected to a battery of mental and physical tests to make sure they won't snap and stomp around the studio on a murderous rampage. They've got a team of lawyers whose sole purpose is to figure out how they can imply that you should try crazy things to lose weight like their contestants at home by yourself, without them being liable for your disastrous outcome. They leave it up to you to know how your own body is going to react to the assured destruction of the nuclear war you're about to levy upon it.

Profit is about is reaching the largest base of consumers with the most generalized approach; fishing with a net versus fishing with a spear. The number on the scale is something that everyone can relate to and access easily to diagnose their worth. So the entire diet and fitness industry has become about embracing that number and placing it on a pedestal. The problem is that yes, you can reduce the number on the scale (temporarily) by starving yourself, but it will also leave you weak and formless. We're conditioned to focus on that number and through group psychology, condition everyone else to do the same. Somewhere along the line the popular approach to weight loss became ""diet and exercise"". Before that, ""diet"" was the popular word for ""starve"".

So now the accepted method for becoming a better person is lots and lots of cardio and starving yourself. Anthing -- literally anything -- to make that number drop. It's your score in the game of life.

* [Redditor montereyo's 6 month progression.](http://i.imgur.com/1HgnU.jpg)

This girl is from Reddit post I saw about a month ago and weighs exactly the same in both panes. 137 pounds. I'd get into the misconception about girls and weightlifting but I'm going on another tangent right now and I'm still trying to stay under 10 pages.

The number on the scale means absolutely nothing. It's the variables that matter. If I weigh 300 pounds but I move around like I weigh 200, I will look better to myself than if I weighed 200 pounds and moved around like I weighed 300. The weight on the scale is the sum of 3 variables of which you can predicatively manipulate but not really accurately measure with any degree of certitude unless you have lots of money. There are of course many other variables, including bone density, but we tend to focus on three of them that we have the most control over and they happen to also be the three that matter the most when we're discussing body composition and appearance. Lean muscle mass, fat mass, and body water.

You can manipulate the values of those variables through nutrition alone.

* **Lean Muscle Mass** = Protein
* **Body Fat Mass** = Sugar
* **Body Water** = Hydration + Lean Muscle Mass + Sugar

* **Body Composition** = Protein + Hydration - Sugar

The number on a normal scale will give you everything, while disregarding your body's composition. When you're gaining muscle, that number on your $20 superstore scale will spike because muscle weighs more than fat and the more muscle mass you put on, the more water you'll be storing, especially if you take creatine like I do. So even if you're cutting fat, you'll still end up weighing more if you gain muscle. That overall number should drop over a period of months, not weeks.

If you're trying to lose weight in general while also trying to improve your body composition, you're probably going to drive yourself insane. I weigh 273 pounds right now but I feel amazing. I shaved 5 minutes off of my CrossFit baseline WOD time yesterday. I did that baseline the first time 2 weeks ago when I was 13 pounds lighter.

* [The Statue of David](http://i.imgur.com/ULNrT.jpg)

Use your mind to wrap a silk sheet taut around Mr. David's midsection there and then shine a light from just above him. It will look amazing because his definition will translate through the sheet because there's nothing between the stone and the sheet. The stone will create peaks and crevices in the sheet that catch light like the sun setting over a valley rather than the boring scene you'd see if you imagined a flat desert. Or if you prefer a less poetic explanation: it's the reason body builders cover themselves in brown goo before going on stage. They want their definition to absorb as much light as possible to create contrasting shadows.

Now, that same concept translates to human beings, except the sheet is skin, and the stone is muscle. The problem is that between the skin and muscle is a layer of fat that will obfuscate the peaks and crevices that the muscle's definition should be providing. I.E., sun setting over a flat desert. The skin is still taut but in order to lay against the defined muscle and create the necessary textures, it must first go through a layer of fatty insulation.

Body fat -- the only thing in the way of your ""toned"" look -- can be attacked through nutrition alone. The goal is to increase your basal metabolic rate, while inhibiting the storage of body fat by cutting out carbohydrates from your diet. Doing that will put you in a ketogenic state, which will cause you to burn both dietary and body fat for energy instead of glycogen. A high protein, low dietary fat, and low carbohydrate diet will ensure that you're burning body fat while building or retaining lean muscle mass. Resistance training will result in more lean muscle mass and higher bone density, which will increase your basal metabolic rate and overall weight, as well as improve your health. Increasing your heart rate for an extended period of time will also increase your basal metabolic rate.

If your body doesn't get enough fuel (calories) to convert to energy, it will assume that you are starving and decrease your basal metabolic rate, which will result a preference to store your body fat rather than burn it. Instead, your body will begin to catabolize (burn) your lean muscle mass for its energy. That's why a lot of marathon runners you'll see look both decrepit and chubby somehow and why people who try to improve their appearance by eating at a caloric deficit and then go and spend an hour or more on an elliptical 7 days a week will look exactly the same or worse 3 months in to their campaign. Cardio is for endurance, not appearance. 

Now that I've added CrossFit and metabolic conditioning to my plan, I need more fuel because I'll be burning more fuel. Otherwise it's like planning a road trip and only filling up the tank a quarter of the way. If I keep doing that at every gas stop, eventually there's going to be a stretch of road without a gas station that's too long and it'll leave me casually strolling to the next station with a red-can-of-shame in hand. I just have to fill the tank to full every stop and trust in my car's ability to make efficient use of the fuel.

So, while you guys see me gain 11 pounds this week, I can only see myself looking like Thor in 5 years. What happens to my number on the scale today, or this month, or this 3 months, is irrelevant. Science is my homeboy now. I also have access to body composition analysis data from a Tanita scale each week that reaffirms my beliefs, which makes it fairly easy to remain pious.

So no. No, I certainly don't feel bad about steadily gaining weight. You hear the rush of Niagra Falls getting louder and assume I'm about to get dropped to my untimely and grisly death. I hear the rush of Niagra Falls getting louder and smile because of the jet pack I've been wearing for awhile now. I'm just waiting for a little bit of a drop so I can take off. I'll probably end up around 200 pounds. I just don't know when and I'm feeling so much more comfortable not caring about that.

The secret to transforming myself from a 538 pound man into a 273 man was to treat myself like two different people. One is so far in the past that it's already like he only ever existed in photographs. The other has a firm grasp on his life and isn't letting go for anything. I tended my wounds and took detours around my weaknesses until I felt strong enough to attack them.

Now I'm stalking my way through those weaknesses like a lion through high grass with my head up and my eyes tracking with the movement of the life that I want; each and every fear casually rolling off of my shoulders only to be left behind, innocently swaying in a chorus of whispers alongside the others. If life only knew I was coming. If it only knew in its last moment -- its last breath free of my clenched fists would be drawn in an ineffable shrieking gasp as we connect and a shimmering mosaic is cast into the backdrop of its eyes as my own eyes reflect the moonlight that lights the scene. That awkward and ironic moment when I'm the one flashing before life's eyes.

Hey, r/fitness! I've been a longtime lurker on here, and a few people have asked me to post my story, so I guess it's about time to contribute something. I hope this post can inspire other women to lift heavy and be strong, and to ignore myths that lifting weights will make you masculine. I am proof that this is not true! And I hope this reaches those of you with health issues that feel like sometimes it will just never happen, because I have news for you- it will if you work for it.

My whole life, I was overweight and had asthma, tons of allergies etc. I played basketball and soccer growing up, but this couldn't counter some of the unhealthy choices I made as a kid. I was sexually abused at a very young age, which threw me into a spiraling depression throughout my childhood, and subsequently, I started to eat compulsively as a way to comfort myself. My parents would try to encourage me to be more active, but I was a bit of a couch potato. I was bullied a lot in school because of my size, and that contributed to all of my problems even more. I remember getting a physical in 5th grade and crying hysterically because at the age of eleven I already weighed 139 pounds. But I didn't do much to change.

Fast forward to high school, and my health began to spiral out of control. I weighed around 165 my first two years of high school, and did a very small amount of physical activity. My asthma started to get really bad, and I had to get put on prednisone a few times and paid a visit to the E.R. The doctors couldn't figure out what was causing my asthma to flair up, so they prescribed me Advair 250/500, which got rid of my asthma symptoms, but wreaked total chaos on my entire body. I gained 20 pounds in a matter of a few months, my depression got even worse, and my appetite went crazy. I started to become photosensitive and broke out in painful hives if I stayed in the sun. On top of that, Advair pretty much caused my metabolism to screech to a halt. Even when I would try to start exercising again, it seemed to be for nothing, because it was impossible to lose the weight. My weight crawled from 176 to 185 and didn't show signs of stopping. I would be miserable up until my third year of university, when I met my respirologist and naturopath and they changed my life forever.

My lung doctor told me all my asthma problems could be potentially eliminated if I lost 20 pounds. As well, he switched me off of Advair (by the way, 70% of Advair gets absorbed through your tongue) and put me on Alvesco, which only gets activated in your airways. He referred me to a naturopath who got me taking numerous supplements such as fish oil, a B complex, a mineral compound called AOR Bone Basics, zinc citrate, magnesium, and CLA, which all helped my asthma as well as my metabolism. I was also introduced by her to what basically comes down to being a low carb diet, but over time I modified it to my own liking/purposes. 

Essentially, my diet consists mostly of vegetables and protein, with minimal starches/grains. The extent of grains I eat are a half cup max of steel cut oats or quinoa per day or a piece of Ezekiel toast and I try to limit that to days where I'm lifting extra heavy. I don't eat any refined foods or sugar, except for sparingly using local raw honey or maple syrup. 


I ended up losing 25 more pounds than was suggested. I started working out in January 2012, the first ten pounds were lost just from diet. Initially, I just did a half hour of cardio 4-5x a week for about five months, and then during the summer, I didn't have time to get to my gym, so I did bodyweight routines and HIIT workouts at home before going to work at a commercial photography studio and doing manual labor.

I started lifting in September 2012. So far, I've been doing a few plans made by Jamie Eason, who is huge motivation. I did the 12 week Tone and Define program she wrote, as well as her LiveFit Trainer. Ultimately, I lift 6 days a week and usually 4 or 5 days of cardio for 45 minutes, doing intervals. Right now I'm transitioning between workout plans, but am about to start Pauline Nordin's full body Badass Workouts and her Fighter Diet plan, and am super excited about it!

Now, I am 100% medication free and most of my allergies are gone. I was a size 13 fitting tight, and now I am a size 5 without anything bulging out. I keep noticing things that I've never seen on my body before, like hip bones and shoulder blades and collar bones and my jawline and it feels AWESOME! I'm not done yet though. I want to gain more definition all over and drop my body fat percentage a bit more.

I've never been so sore in my life, but I feel accomplished. 

Edits below: Total time was about probably...15 hours. Left the start line at around 5, and got in to portland around 8:00 PM. Maybe 2 hours break time total in between...

So probably about 15-16 miles per hour. I couldn't look at my computer that much, 'cause looking down meant I'd see my mileage and the though ""I have 74 more miles to go."" might have killed me.

There were definitely some hard spots where I thought about just laying down and dying. Right past a little town called ""Vader"" we hit mile 130-140, and I just thought ""I might die right now. I can't do another 64 godforsaken miles. No way.""

I just kept peddling though. 

As for what I ate? Pretty much everything in sight. The STP is very well organized, so there's water/food stops every 25 miles or so, and they had EVERYTHING you could want to eat.

Lots of Goo, clif bars, cookies, sandwiches, and gatorade. Tons of high carb stuff. Makes me really re-think low-carb diets.

For training, I tried to ride about 50-100 miles a week. I kind of slacked a bit towards the end for some reason though. A combination of actual bike riding, and gym biking.

Now, a bit of context: This is on a Marine base, in an Enlisted gym, so people here generally know how to not be assholes, and how to properly use the equipment. I was kind of in disbelief of what I was seeing, as curling in the squat rack was (up to this point) something I've only read about on here.

I reach down to pause my music so I can go ask them how many sets they're doing. No point in causing some bro-drama, I'll just wait my turn. Before I can take half a step over there, I see an incredible sight: The biggest marine we've got in our gym is full on SPRINTING over to the rack, veins popping out of his forehead and neck (not an abnormal sight for Staff NCO's, I suppose...) wearing a shirt that indicates he's a Staff Sergeant (kinda highish for the enlisted chain). 

He then proceeds to scream and chew ass like it's bubblegum, and demands that all of them get the hell out of his gym and not come back until they've written him a paper on the proper use of every single weight machine and rack in the gym. Then, as if nothing has happened, he walks back to his bench and goes back into a set.

Later at the water fountain I found out he's corrected them in the past, and they gave him lip. Guess he'd had enough.

9/9, not a single red light, 2 all-time PRs, lowest I’ve weighed for the 132s, all-time meet PR regardless of weight, Wilks PR, coached a good friend’s first PL meet (she hit around a 340 Wilks like a boss).  Before going into the details, this was pretty much the best meet I could have ever asked for and then some.

##Thanks##

I would like to thank two people in particular, without you two this meet wouldn’t have happened the way it did and for your support and friendship I am extremely grateful,

* gzcl - for always being there to discuss training, validate me or rightfully call me a complete idiot, push me to be better, and always keeping it real.  We give each other shit all the time, but it's always in good fun to push each other to be better than the day before.  Total bromance goin on.
* smoftie - for doing your first meet like a boss, letting me crash at your place and hauling my farting-ass around, listening to my coaching to the T, and being an awesome person, even if you do go full-tard too often.

##Pre-Meet##

Between the San Jose Open I did back in October and this meet, I injured my shoulder and strained my abs, both in one week back in late-Novemeber.  I took a bit over a month off with zero lifting and got back into it in January.  From there, I really didn’t have a program, but it wasn’t fucking around either – just listening to my body and attempting to make smart work-set selections each week.  **That's right, I did my own thing and didn't follow a program, gasp**.  For bench, that meant hitting a 5 lb single rep heavier than the week before, doing a couple sets of 8-10 reps at around 135, and then going home.  For deadlift, **I trained sumo and then pulled a conventional PR in competition**, so sumo will be staying in my training, most likely a 2:1 ratio (pull sumo for 2 weeks, then conventional).  Squat was a bit trickier.  I knew the 123 raw record for USAPL was 385 and I knew I could hit that, but when I started to have my eye on it, I started going a bit heavier too soon or doing extra work-sets, so I realized I needed to just recover and not push too hard, so I decided not to cut to 123s and lift as a 132er.

##Dat Der Meet##

This was a pretty large meet, nearly 110 lifters, spread across two platforms and four flights apiece.  I was in flight C and the friend I was coaching was in flight A, which was absolutely perfect.  This allowed me to focus on her during her flight and her warm-ups (while flight D went) and then switch to my warm-ups and my lifts during the other flights, so I couldn’t have asked for better scheduling in that regard.

###Squats###

My squat warm-ups were pretty standard, but when I hit my last warm-up at 335 lbs, it was a very awkward lift and much harder than it should have been.  This got me all worked up and nervous as I thought of every reason why it could have gone poorly.  Eventually I realized I wrapped my thumbs under the bar (seems to help alleviate some elbow issues) and I don’t do it too often, so I felt like that might have been the cause.  I decided to basically say fuck it and keep my thumb over the bar and deal with any elbow pain a bit later.

Squat opener at 165 kg / 363 lbs flew up pretty fast and felt good, no elbow pain either.  3 white lights, and then I put myself down for a solid 175 kg / 385 lbs as a second attempt.  That one felt a bit heavier on the walk-out, but the rep itself was still pretty fluid and way faster than I was expecting so with that in mind, I said fuck it all, we’re going to PR territory and put down 185 kg / 407.9 lbs as my third attempt.  I visualized the lift several times before doing it, tried to treat it just like any other lift, and then crushed that shit.  All-time PR in the books and 3.2xBW squat given 3 white lights by USAPL judges … so far so good.

###Bench###

Bench was tricky beast, as I knew I didn’t have much training with it since November, so I decided to go light and play it by ear.  Initially I was planning 198/209/220, but after a ridiculously easy 198, I put down 97.5 kg / 214 lbs as my second attempt, so that I could either make a small nudge to 220 or a bit higher if it felt good.  After the second attempt (another set of 3 white lights), I realized 220 was going to happen without a problem, so I decided 226 would be better (231 probably wasn’t going to go, plus that would be 16 lbs heavier than anything I’ve done since the injury).  226 was slow, but it never crossed my mind that I wouldn’t get the lift, just had to be patient with it.

###Deadlifts###

Deadlift warm-ups initially felt a little heavy, but after I got into lmao3plate territory, things started to feel a bit faster.  In the last month, I changed up my form a bit to have the bar an inch further in front of me than normal, allowing me to get an extremely small roll with the bar to engage my lats and load the hamstrings.  I don’t know if that’s really helped, but it feels nice and prevents me from taking forever to just pull the bar.  187.5 kg / 413 lbs stupidly easy, like all my deadlift openers have been.  I went to 197.5kg / 435 lbs because that would put me in a good spot to go either 205 or 207.5 kg.  My second deadlift felt heavy, but I watched it on video before putting in my third attempt.  When I saw how well it went up, 207.5 kg was immediately put on my attempt card.

At this point, I was 8 for 8, not a single red light, hit an all-time squat PR, was on track with all my goals (actually, ahead on squat and bench), the good friend I was coaching went 8/9 and hit a 340ish Wilks in her first meet, my old college coach was lifting in the next flight doing pretty well, and I had lifted at this meet 3 years ago as my first full meet.  Since that meet three years ago, I graduated, got a nice job doing software engineering, travelled to compete in meets, actually started coaching someone for *their* first meet, started a website for tracking training progress, and so on.  To sum up the next several minutes, I got a massive falcon punch to the feels and I pulled some things from deep down in me when I stepped up to that platform and made that weight mine.  That secured a second all-time PR in this meet, gave me a Wilks PR, total PR, etc.  I gave a good first pump on seeing 3 white lights and walked back to my chair to grab my stuff, with watery eyes as I thought about everything I’ve accomplished in the last three years and what I can do in the next three.

##Post-Meet##

My next meet will be USAPL Raw Nationals in July so long as I’m not injured, haha.  After that, I have no idea what my next meet would be.  Maybe IPL Worlds if gzcl does it, or 2014 Arnolds, I don’t know.  I have a good idea of what I would like to do for my next training cycle and how it will be structured.  I won’t really go into detail here (though I have mentioned it to I think two or three people in total) because I find I do better if I use a, “do first, talk later” approach and I want to make sure that I bring my A-game at Raw Nationals, this was just a dress rehearsal.  I will say that I will be incorporating direct hypertrophy training and actual conditioning and mobility specific days.

**tl;dr** – manlet lifts some weights, and has pretty much the best meet he could have ever asked for and then some.

So I just wanted to give a big shoutout to everyone in this subreddit. I figured I would post up my progress pics over the passed couple years.

A little background, I was always a big kid, just hated sports, loved to game and eat, pogos and tv dinners (hungry mans) were my diet, hell even to this day I could beast a box of pogos like nothing.

Anyway, one day I decided to do something, it was inbetween me carrying a plate of like 8 microwaved pogos to my computer desk when I got winded bringing my plate upstairs and was like shit, im a fatty. I never had problems with girls, the weight never bothered me, although I didn't like tight shirts showing off my gut etc..

So one day I decided to sign up at the gym, if I hated it, fuck it I wouldnt go, I was lazy what did I care? Anyways, I started at the gym and ended up loving it, started with some rediculous plan where I was doing all sorts of weird worksouts with cables, balls, super setting this with that, it was a mess, but it did work and laid the ground work for what I am now (I am slightly better at planning my workouts now... lol)

Anyways, here are the pics, I don't think I have any at 375 exactly, but I think somewhere in the ballpark of 315-325.

Anyways, here they are;

Key points:

* Exercise, alcohol consumption, and diet outside of egg yolks consumed were not studied.

* The study was not a trial (participants choose the number of yolks they eat), so correlations between yolk consumption and other lifestyle factors aren't considered in the study.

* The sample was relatively small, older (average age: 62), and all had previous risk-factors for heart disease.

* The study was limited in that it only examined plaque buildup in the neck arteries - there is a lack of consensus about the effects of eggs on overall cardiovascular health.

Quick Backstory:

I've lifted off an on (mostly off) throughout college (2007 - 2011) with okay results, though never getting into really good shape. I was pretty lean but not too strong(weighing 175). Once I graduated college and got a full time job I stopped lifting for ~1.5 years. By that time I weighed around 190... and was getting back into lifting, this time more seriously. I decided even though I already had some fat I was gonna bulk anyways. This lasted for a few months and I got up to 220 (a pretty dirty bulk), which is where the cut begins. Unfortunately I don't think I have any pictures of the pre-bulk, but I guess I would say I was ""skinny fat"".

I followed the LeanGains workout plan for the most part. I lifted 3x / week with the following split:

Workout A: Deadlift 2x5 ; OHP 3x5 ; Pull-ups 2x8-10 (Failure)

Workout B: Bench Press 3x5 : Chin-ups 3x8-10 (failure) ; Dips 2x10-15(failure)

Workout C: Squat 3x5 ; Various leg accessory exercises (changes, but is usually vertical jump training of some kind. Either rim touches or simply pickup basketball)


Note: For part of the cut I did 3x5 , for part I did RPT. The only cardio done ever was Basketball (average 2x / week - post lifting or on off days)


Current Lift #'s:

Squat: 290 (3x5)  

Deadlift: 345 (1x5)

Bench: 195 (3x5) 

Overhead Press: 135 (3x5)

All of these lifts have dropped 10-20 lbs (except for DL which has gone up 20 lbs somehow)

****
Diet:
I tried to follow the LeanGains ""diet plan"" of eating with a 16/8 window (only eating within an 8 hour window. Usually 2PM-10PM). I also tried to follow the principle of LeanGains where you would eat a higher amount of carbs on your workout days and higher amounts of fats on your off days. I say tried because I was not very meticulous with the calories/macros - but it did effect my food choices to some degree. I think that in fitness the 80/20 rule is good for me, as it reminds me to get the essentials done (lift 3x / week, high protein, rough calorie tracking) but not to obsess over it. This has been key in helping me not burn out so far.

Here is an example of my typical workout day / off day:

(note: I eat take out basically every day, also I have broken my ""diet"" on many occasions... candy/cakes/whatever.. like once a week)

Workout Day: 1x Footlong Chicken Breast Subway sub (w/ bag of chips); 2x Protein Shakes (2 scoops each = 4 scoops a day); 1x Chipotle Burrito

Off Day: 1x Baconator (Wendy's) ; 2x Protein Shakes (2 scoops each = 4 scoops a day)


The goal is about 3.3k cals on bulk days and 2.3k on off days. I also have not changed this value at all since starting the cut, which caused me to lose a lot of weight at first, and its has since tapered off.
*****
I took the Progress pictures on the 1st and 15th of every month (coinciding with my paychecks). For some of the pictures I took it the morning after a workout day(""bulk day"") and then the next in the series is the next day, after an off-day (""cut day"") This is why I am sometimes wearing different clothes even though they may both be the ""week 6 picture"". One was taken the 1st of the month, and the next was taken the 2nd. All pictures are taken 1st thing in the morning, no flex and no pump with the same lighting(hard to do even in the same conditions apparently). 

Its also the same pair of pants in the 1st/last pic, for a basis of comparison.

I forgot about these pictures, just found them so figured I’d share them. Let this be encouragement for my fellow hardgainers. Pics are about a year apart.

I finished highschool at 140 pounds then went through all of college never exceeding 145 pounds at 6 foot 2 inches (I have never read a hardgainer transformation story with numbers that terrible). After leaving school I decided to get some weights on craigslist and get serious. Less than a year later I reached 165.

During this time I ate fairly clean, but not nearly enough food. Virtually no protein shakes at all (I bought one 2 pound jar of protein powder and it lasted me the entire year). I completely failed to consume adequate protein, enough calories, or take advantage of the workout “window”.

At the time I believed there was a protein powder conspiracy and thought it wasn't as necessary as supplement companies want us to believe. Unfortunately, I found eating mostly carrots and celery to be completely useless for a hardgainer. Fortunately, my appetite became increasingly ravenous as the year progressed and I began finally getting more calories towards the end. I very much expect I would have significantly improved my gains had I eaten and supplemented optimally. I have since begun implementing protein shakes and have noticed major improvements.

After my transformation I promptly landed a gorgeous girlfriend after a lifetime of singleness. Furthermore, a movie producer and director spotted me and persuaded me to be co-lead in their film. I mostly stopped working out this last year being so busy with filming, girlfriend, and starting my own business, but now I'm getting back at it and am getting close to my goal of 175.

Confidence is growing, girls are noticing, doors are opening, success is happening. Working out has literally changed my life.

MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW PERFECT FORM**

**Posture fixes - how to fix the upper body hunchback**

So, in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ewrr0/writeup_on_the_dreaded_anterior_pelvic_tilt_or/) post, I talked about the anterior pelvic tilt and how to fix it. If you haven’t read that, please do. This post shall be about the upper body dysfunction that normally accompanies the lower body issues.  But let’s get one thing straight – you can fix the upper body as much as you want, but unless the lower body is optimally aligned, the upper body will not be. The upper body is a slave to the lower body. Fix the lower body and the upper body gets a lot better. Fix the upper body and the lower body will not necessarily follow. I hope you understand this.

Most people in today’s society have the “Quasimodo” look, the bent upper back with slumped shoulders and a neck that juts out. This can be lead to a lot of tension in the upper traps and the levator scapulae, can lead to the open mouth breathing, and in some cases, can lead to migraines.  The tight muscles in this scenario are usually the pec minor, the lats and sometimes, the upper abs. The stretched out muscles are the rhomboids, the mid and lower traps, and the thoracic extensors. Remember the hamstrings from yesterday’s article? The levators and traps are the equivalent of the hamstrings, as in, they are in a stretched position. Look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/cTu1U.gif) picture of the head jutting forward. The levators have to always be active, or else the head is gonna succumb to gravity. Stretching them will only make the matter worse. The trick is to get the thoracic spine back into its natural curves, and to get the head into a more neutral position – “floating” on top of the body.

So let’s get down to fixing this:

1)	Thoracic mobility. The spine consists of 3 areas – lumbar, thoracic and cervical. The thoracic spine is built for mobility, the cervical and lumbar spine is built for stability. In today’s society, the thoracic spine gets “locked” and immobile, and to make u for that, the lumbar spine has to move. This leads to a lot of low back pain and neck pain. So let’s make the thoracic spine mobile.  I have found that [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyhgIJq9gjw) or [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1MCjihXq0&amp;feature=related) is the best exercise for thoracic spine extension mobility. Stay away from the lumbar and cervical region. Start from just below the shoulder blades and work your way up to the top of the shoulder blades. I have found that the best exercise for thoracic rotation mobility is [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo8rPut0GXI&amp;feature=fvsr). Make sure that the legs do not move and stay at a 90 degree angle. Only move from the upper back.

2)	[Stretching out the anterior torso and the lats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgxr6xAB5ZM). If you have a history of throwing, the sleeper stretch in the video is a good addition too. if you have lax shoulders, it's probably a bad idea though.

3)	Work on scapular depression and retraction. The best bet for both would be [wall slides](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k2kqyzz3Ug) – they also open up the anterior shoulder. Don’t worry about keeping your wrist flat to the wall, the main thing is to get the elbows as low as possible without overarching the lower back. If you do it right, you’ll feel it the next day.

4)	Work on your deep neck flexors. The best exercise is the [chin tuck](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUkocZqnoFU). Imagine making a double chin.

5)	In my lower body post, a person mentioned doing [crunches](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/RectusAbdominis/BWCrunch.html) for the abs and posted this video.  While they are a decent exercise, look at the end range of the movement. A lot of people are stuck in that position throughout the day, and we don’t need more exercises to put them in that position. If you have to crunch, [reverse crunch](http://stronglifts.com/the-reverse-crunch-get-your-six-pack-abs/) – they don’t compress the rib cage. I would rather you not crunch at all.


So a good warmup for correcting upper body dysfunction would include:

1)	3-5 minutes of [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46lGxDD4N9g). It's not necessary to move around like in the video, i prefer relaxing and imaginging my hands are dead weights. Poliquin and some other strength coaches have noticed a 2-5% increase in strength in their athletes after performing this. This can also be performed as a stand alone stretch for 15-20 minutes.

2)	Foam rolling of the pecs, lats and thoracic extensors.

3)	[Thoracic mobility](http://stronglifts.com/how-to-improve-your-thoracic-mobility/) coupled with scapular stability exercises – pick 2-3 from the thoracic mobility list and either do a set of wall slides or [rock, reach and lift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O5UbsYQjbY&amp;feature=related).

4)	[Shoulder flexion + hip extension pattern](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36NirsVrPok&amp;feature=player_embedded)

5)	[T-roll push-ups](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gatFVitWEIo&amp;feature=player_embedded) to teach the body how to use the enhanced thoracic mobility and scapular stability effectively.

There is a lot of info I left out on purpose; a lot of people nowadays have too much information to deal with and it leads to analysis paralysis. For a general workout program, be sure to include front squats as that works on thoracic extension, and have a 2:1 pull:push ratio or even a 3:1 pull:push ratio until you feel that your posture has gotten better. Charles Poliquin has [advocated](http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/121/Barbell_vs_Dumbbell_Rows.aspx) using DB rows instead of BB rows because of the extra range of motion and a better scapular retraction; I highly recommend doing that too. Another important exercise to add to your repertoire is the [face pull](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQS-tXL1CLg), it works the upper back and will get your shoulders in alignment very fast. One good low level exercise is the [Waterbury crucifix](http://www.t-nation.com/img/photos/249crucifix2.jpg). Hold it for 2 minutes and keep the back straight.

One thing that I feel I will get a lot of questions on is the [YTWL](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xck3d8LidME) exercise. While I do like the W and the L part, I do not like the Y and the T. The Y because I feel that it’s a very unnatural movement, and the long lever of the arm can impinge on the shoulder. The T because the scapula retractors mostly work isometrically and not concentrically. If the exercises work for you, great go with it. But if you’re not familiar with them, the exercises I’ve outlined above will work fine. Another exercise that I’m iffy about is the [prone cobra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdWi2eCkvHY). It’s very easy to get extension at the lumbar spine instead of thoracic, and I think front squats are way better because they force you to extend the thoracic spine. Nick Tumminello does have a work-around for this [here](http://nicktumminello.com/2009/07/a-new-and-improved-ytwl/).

And there you have it. A pretty comprehensive program to reduce the curved upper back. Again, remember that this is a very small part of your day, and if you have bad posture the rest of the day, this isn't gonna help much. Be aware of posture and change your position every 20 minutes or so.

If you go through Eric Cressey's and Mike Roberton's blogs and newsletters, they have plenty of information on posture too. these two articles are also really helpful:

**Equipment**

- Quality/maintenance

Fortunately good quality stuff. Unfortunately maintenance is crap. Not uncommon to find one dumbbell missing from a pair. Dumbbells are treated as magical beings that somehow will return to their proper place when you look away. 

- Usage

Even though PTs are in abundance there are plenty of people misusing equipment. The squat rack is for anything but squats. In total I've seen less than ten people doing squats here. 
The no-weight-pull-and-slam with machines is norm. 

**People**

- PTs

Annoying sales men with little training. They get commission on the people they manage to bring into the gym. They sell classes, but with their level of trade training (~1 week?) it is not recommended. I've seen a PT sitting eating a sandwich next to a woman doing sit-ups. 

- Members

High and low. Some are extremely professional with their workouts, other not so... I've seen plenty of dudes just hanging out. Five guys going together and occupying benches for an hour is common around rush hours. 

**Outifts**

- Women

Pants pulled a little bit too high is the norm. I've laughed at women in heels working the step machine. Looks before functionality is the mantra. 

- Men

Jeans with mobile phone clips are frequently seen. Dudes with underwear doubling as ""shorts"" are common. 

**Changing rooms**

- Facilities

I've been going to six different gyms and not a single one has had a shower area that doesn't turn into a steam sauna. For some reason ventilation is not prioritized. 

- Freebies

Hair dryers are provided, but should probably be called body hair dryers. Cue tips are availble. They are used for cleaning most body orifices, including the backdoor. 

**""Incident""**

I read [this article](http://shanghaiist.com/2006/08/15/eye_on_gay_shan_4.php) too late... 

[Me going about my usual workout when I notice some foreign guy is doing the same stuff as me. Strikes me as a bit odd, but nothing more. I finish up and hit the shower and steam sauna. The guys sits down across from me and stares at my cock. Awkward! I walk out and start to get dressed. Guys walks over and starts introducing himself as Francois (or something else very French). I know no straight guy would EVER start talking with another one without pants. I try to be polite but desperately hurries up and walk out. Halfway down the hall I can hear him calling.]

F: Excuse me! Excuse me!

[I was raised to be polite and stop.]

F: Do you have time?

Me: For what?

[Starts sweating.]

F: For sex! 

[I panic! I would've been speechless even if it was a girl.]

Me: Sorry dude, I don't swing that way.

[Looks like he doesn't understand.]

Me: I'm sorry, I'm not gay.

F: You don't have to be gay for le blowjob.

[Panic.]

Me: I'm not gay. 

[Try not to look affected and walk out.]

Knew I was going to see him again at the gym. Manned up, walked over, and apologized next time I saw him. He saw it as I was regretful and gave me his business card. Doh!

I like to observe abnormalities, but in the end I don't really care what other people do as long as they just get on with own their business.

I started experiencing discomfort in my wrist and shoulders, so since then I've scaled back my weights a lot to concentrate on perfecting my form. I'm very sure if I tried a 1RM right now, I would not be able to hit the 1K club. 

Also, my new Summer routine is a little different from last year;

Monday: Shoulders - Standing OHP, Sitting OHP, Shoulder Flies, Clean + Jerk (light weights), and a bunch of light shoulder strengthening exercises

Tuesday: Back + Biceps - Deadlifts, Pull Ups, Pull downs, Dumb bell rows, Hammer Curls, Preacher Curls

Wednesday: 5K run, Yoga, or Body Weight Exercises + Squats

Thursday: Chest + Triceps: Flat barbell, flat dumb bells, incline dumb bells, weighted dips, cable crosses

Friday: Same as Wednesday

Saturday: 5K Run

Sunday: Legs - Back Squats, Front squats, Leg Extensions, Hip Adductors, Hamstring Curls, Standing Calf raises, sitting calf raises.

My goals back in December was to cut down to 10% BF @ 170, hit the 1K, body weight exercises and to dunk a basketball. I hover at 11% and have hit 1K, so I've achieved those. Right now, I'm trying to do some cool bodyweight exercises. And [have failed on many of them.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vS-nQmg7as&amp;feature=youtu.be). Still haven't tried dunking a ball yet, but one step at a time!

Also, I'm not sure if anybody has felt this before (Maybe I should save it for Moronic Monday), but I've gotten to a point in my fitness journey, where I feel at zen with my body and my goals. It's weird, but even 6 months ago, I would be really insecure with my body, keep thinking my body isn't good enough, need to be the strongest in the gym, etc. But now, I feel strangely... at peace. I used to think I wouldn't be happy until I hit single % BF, but I'm not even concerned with hitting 10%; I'm happy with 11% and have maintained this weight and bf% for about 5 months. I'm okay with not being the strongest in the gym, I'm okay with not having Zyzz's or Jeff Seid's body; I'm okay with not proving that I can beast 325. I'm having fun everytime I go to the gym or go for a run; I enjoy feeling my heart beat rise, enjoy sweating it out, enjoy the pain of hypertrophy, the complete exhaustion, the DOMs the next day. Is that weird? Of course I'd still have rare times where I feel like I was 215+ again, and feel like shit, but that usually goes away as soon as it appears. 

Quick word about my diet; I'm still counting my calories using MFP (it's seriously habit now) and am eating at 2000 calories for maintenance. I KNOW it sounds ridiculously low, but I've experimented, and this REALLY is my maintenance. (Add 300 for lifting days and 350 for running). I still try to hit at least 100+ grams of protein a day, and that's about it. I eat anything and everything now, as long as I don't go over 2000 calories and have at least 100 grams of protein at the end of the day. 

BUT, I do still make lunch for work, mainly to save money. 

This is what I usually eat at lunch 2-3 times a week;

10 ozs boneless skinless chicken thigh (cut into chunks, stir fried with a metric shit ton of Sriracha, spoon of sugar, light soy sauce, oyster sauce

1 cup of brown rice

1 cup of steamed vegetables

660 Calories: 17 grams of Fat, 63 grams of Carbs and 62 grams of Protein. Sometimes I throw in two fried eggs.

Also, I still stick by the trick (credit to /r/loseit you guys are fucking awesome) of: If I'm really craving something and I'm out of calories, I eat a bite of whatever it is, drink a lot of water or diet pop and top it off with another bite of the caloric dense food. Seriously guys, try it. It works.

Holy shit this was a really long post.

TL;DR Be one with your body!

EDIT: One more thing. I really didn't mean for this update to be so philosophical but I think one of the reasons why I'm so at peace with my body now is that I'm finding a balance in my life. During the first 6 months, fitness and weight loss was my world. I cancelled on my friends, stood up dates, didn't go to bars, didn't even touch alcohol (I could count on one hand the number of times I drank). As a result, I got even more obsessed with fitness because it was the only thing I had. In the past 6 months however, I've really strived to find a balance in my life; I make it a goal to go out and see my friends, meet new people, try new things and better myself in ways other than just fitness. And I feel a lot better about everything. ",,False,,t5_2qhx4,False,,,True,t3_1i4xix,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1i4xix/who_says_asians_are_tiny_pt2_1_year_cut_update/,

This subreddit has been turned into the Starting Strength/Silver Hydra subreddit. Veteran users are, mostly, not open minded to any sort of change or information that goes against the stuff in the FAQ.  Any time a user post a question about other workout methods/routines, they are blasted for thinking about doing anything different from SS/SL.

Silverhydra is a student.  He is not a licensed professional on diet/nutrition.  Someday he may be, but for now you are following the ideas of a novice in the science.  I see people on here talking about CheatMode and fasting before workouts.  If that works for you, great, but the vast majority of athletes wouldn't dare workout on an empty (or mostly empty) stomach.  All I ask is that people use caution before taking the word of someone inexperienced as the whole truth.

SS is not the only nor the best beginner routine out there.  While compound undersizes are great, it misses many smaller muscle groups that are barely activated vs a iso/compound combo routine.  I challenge all SS users to take a week off and switch to a 4 day split routine and see how many muscles are left with soreness akin to the kind you felt as a beginner.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, hopefully it will at least open up a few minds to the fitness world outside of reddit.

I feel uncomfortable ignoring his opinion (I'll ignore it though). 

I have also asked another MD/PhD specializing in orthopedy and ostheopathy. He was less dramatic but told me that indeed many weightlifters develop knee osteoarthritis at a relatively young age, as well as degenerative spine diseases. He told me that I am free to train weightlifting for the sake of performance if I accept the consequences but I should not think of it as an activity which does my body any good.
It's also interesting to note that weightlifting is the only form of exercise those doctors hate, both are perfectly ok with the idea of running a marathon on asphalt barefoot and other similarly extreme stuff I've asked about.

**Prologue:**  
I remember years ago when I first started working out and posting here I went out and put together a program all on my own. I thought it through very thoroughly and was very proud of myself when I'd finished. I made a new thread about it and asked for people to critique it in the title. I expected for the most part people would approve of it and might offer tiny suggestions to improve on it. 

What I got was people telling me it was awful and I needed to scrap it completely and pick up a pre-made program which was created by someone who was an expert in the weightlifting/strength training or bodybuilding field. 

I was upset and annoyed at the time, however it was sound advice. They were right. My program sucked, I did not know what I was doing and if I'd followed it I wouldn't have made any significant long-term gains.

Ask yourself this: Do you know more than Mark Rippetoe, Bill Starr or anyone who has studied strength and hypertrophy training for years and has had countless more years of empirical evidence to refine their knowledge on how to make progress in the gym? (The answer is, of course, ""no"").

Then why would you use some program you've made over one of theirs?

**Why your program is terrible:**  
1) *You've probably designed your program with way too many exercises and way too much volume for a beginner.*  

- Your program should consist primarily of the following exercises: the squat, the bench press, the deadlift, heavy rows and plenty of core work.
- You do not need endless sets of isolation work right now. You need to focus on compound movements and work on getting a solid base/frame. 
- Right now you need to focus on correct form. Master squatting, benching and deadlifting. It's not easy. Odds are you're doing a terrible job on at least two of those exercises. Get a trainer, preferably one who looks like they lift and who has a background in powerlifting, and have them coach you on these essential lifts. 

2) *You've probably designed your program with way too much emphasis on mirror muscles and not enough on others.* 
 
- A good program will have at least as much focus, if not considerably more, on one's back than on one's pecs. Often you see people making programs which have several different benching variations (incline, decline, dumbells, etc), dumbell flies, cable crosses, etc... and then when it's time for back day they do some lat pulldowns and maybe some other fairly useless exercise. This can lead to muscle imbalances which later down the road will mess you and your rotator cuff up. You don't want that. Back in the day when lifters spend tons of time on their back doing rows, pullups, face pulls, deadlifts and other exercises and had strong backs -- nobody had RC problems.
- You're probably neglecting your legs, but this isn't always the case with newbies making programs.

3) *You've probably designed your program and left out tons of crucial information.*

- What are your goals? Strength? Hypertrophy? General fitness? What is your program supposed to do?
- What is your level of fitness? While it's usually ""beginner"", often times people don't even bother to say. An advanced lifter will have a drastically different routine than a beginner. Often times beginners don't realize this and they try to emulate a program designed for someone who has been lifting for years. Small muscles, like yours, don't need nearly as much stimulation to shock them into growth. If you overdo it, you'll just burn yourself out and get nowhere.
- Sometimes you see truly awful programs which just toss out a number of exercises and don't bother to elaborate and then they expect someone to critique it. Other times you get a little more. I've yet to see someone incorporate rest times or tempo into their home-made programs, despite it being important stuff. The answer is because you probably don't understand it, which is precisely why you shouldn't be making your own program to begin with.

4) *Lastly, we see ******ty programs like yours every day.*  

Often multiple times.   
Frankly, it's tiresome.  
Please, read the stickies and pick a program which will work from there.  

There is a saying that ""Anything will work... for about 6 weeks"", which is probably true. You might see minor progress with whatever terrible program you've made but in time you will stall out and you will not make much, if any, progress. Think long-term, drop your ego and realize there are people out there who dedicate their lives to this and they know more than you. Find a program which suits your level of fitness and your goals. Use it.

5) *Here are some excellent programs which I hope you consider looking into:*

- [Rippetoes aka Starting Strength: I can personally attest to this program being superb. It's designed for any novice or beginner lifter but also for more experienced lifters who might not be used to a program consisting of heavy, compound movements. This will get you strong and if your diet is in order you will get bigger.](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=998224)

- [Bill Starr 5x5 aka Madcow 5x5: I love this one. It's for an intermediate lifter and the focus of this program is to get you strong as quickly as possible. And it works.](http://muscleandbrawn.com/madcow-intermediate-5x5-workout/)

- [HST (Hypertrophy/Strength Training): I haven't personally lifted in this style but plenty of people swear by it. This should work well for someone looking for gains in both strength and hypertrophy (ie. getting both strong and bigger muscles).](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=280813), ---&gt; [backup link](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=714401)

- [German Volume Training: I've ran this and even having lifted for years before I ran it I was sore as a dog after pretty much every workout. DOMS doesn't necessarily mean it's working, but this is a pretty rough ride. GVT is designed to primarily make you bigger (hypertrophy).](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/luis13.htm)

- [There are PLENTY of other programs. Here is a guide here, one of the stickies you SHOULD have already read...](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=113707701)

- You should also venture out into the other sections, the Nutrition and Exercise ones especially (not so much the misc, you're better off not going there). I can promise you that you're going to learn a lot and help your progress if you do.

Normally after a workout I'd just be tired and lethargic, but this afternoon played out a little differently. 

From the moment I arrived, the squat racks were occupied. I got frustrated as I delayed my squats later and later into the workout. Eventually, I had done all my other exercises, but neither rack was free. 

So, I approached one of the guys between his sets and asked him how many sets he had left. ""Oh, I'm gonna be here a while,"" he said, ""...but you could work in with me.""

I agreed, and we took turns with out sets. After the second set, he asks, ""can I give you a little advice on your form?"" He then told me what I was doing wrong, and what to do instead. The next set felt *so* much cleaner.

He mentioned I should do a search on the internet for StrongLifts, to which I replied that I had been doing Starting Strength, but substituting hyperextensions for deadlifts. I told him that I didn't feel confident enough in my form to start doing DLs. 

He then took the next 5-10 minutes (keep in mind he's still in the middle of his workout) and gave me advice on improving my form and progressing to high weights. 

To recap, I managed to get my squats in despite the busy gym, I corrected my squat form, and I have gained more confidence and knowledge in doing deadlifts. All because I simply asked.

I was never able to break 300, 295 had been my max. Finally, I asked an older gentleman to spot me and he certainly did. He asked, ""how much is this?"" I answered ""315, no lift off please."" He asked, ""Have you ever done this before?"" I answered, ""Nope.""

His reaction was something along the lines of *fuck, now I am going to have to pull this weight off the kids chest*

Yup, hit it once, no bounce. It felt great. Then I lower it again, and boom, two fucking reps. My body weight is 210, btw. 

Sorry, I had to share with someone.

TLDR: I had never benched over 300 once, got 315 twice.

Any questions I'll be more than happy to answer!

[EDIT]

First off, I apologize for the somewhat shitty pictures, the old photo was taken on a old camera, and the most recent was taken on laptop webcam, hence the shitty quality.

I was 15 in the first photo, and in the second photo (which was a few weeks ago) I was 18, I've just turned 19 this month

Here is my weekly workout plan for those interested!
https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_ZCzQV6WXHOUFNnaFlDZlRSSUU/edit?usp=sharing

As a rugby player, my goals have always been to become bigger and stronger, however at the same time keeping my overall conditioning and fitness at an acceptable level. Therefore, you will see that EVERYTHING in my workouts is super-setted, and rest periods are also short in order for me to remain conditioned.

Right now I'm in my off-season, and therefore am bulking. When it comes closer towards the summer I will begin to cut and work more cardio, and prepare for the september rugby season.

In 2010, I played rugby for Canada on their U17 development team, and since then I have been working to play again for them, when it comes to U21.

My diet is pretty strict, and while I don't weigh out my food or count my calories, what I eat is pretty staple because I have a pretty strict day-to-day routine with school. For breakfast I will have a bowl of vector and a protein shake. My diet while im at school pretty much is made up of quinoa, pasta, apple, banana, carrots, chicken breast, chick peas, almonds and some beef jerky. Then for dinner I'll have chicken breast, vegetables, and brown rice. I'll even snack a bit in between.

Here are some extra photos for those who would possibly like to see legs/back shots, and even some past rugby pics. They all will vary from 2010-present

P.S The team shot photo with the banner, I'm the one with the eye-patch because I got a gash right above my eye, haha.

17 years old in the first picture and 19 years old.

Started at 145 lbs, bulked to 185 lbs and currently down to 170 lbs.

I follow a five day split

* Monday: Chest and Abs
* Tuesday: Back and Calves
* Wednesday: Legs
* Thursday: Shoulders Abs
* Friday: Triceps Biceps

I follow a similar routine as [this guy](http://www.simplyshredded.com/josef-rakich-interview.html)

**Sample Day While Cutting:**

~2100-2200 total Calories

~260g of Protein

~130g of Carbs

~60g of Fat

* Oatmeal Packet, 6 egg whites with cheese, diet green tea
* Turkey sandwich
* half pound chicken breast with veggies
* 30g dextrose + whey protein shake (during workout)
* 2 cups of milk and a can of tuna (post workout)
* 1-2 pork chops
* 2-6 spoons of peanut butter

I also added in 2-3 days of HIIT during the cut as well as a refeed day where I would drop my fat intake as low as possible, protein to about 170g, and carbs to 500-600.

I've always been an ~~busy body~~ active individual, prior to my weight training regimen I was, for many years, a practitioner of brazilian jiu jitsu and muay thai; with that said I was never happy with my weight/size. My walking weight would be anywhere from 118-120lbs at 5'7"" and at that size meant I would be placed in the rooster weight division when I competed in grappling tournaments which wasn't all that fun due to how shallow the pool of competition was. 

So, last year on 09/25/11 I started my weight/strength training regimen and like many beginners new to weight training I jumped on SS and GOMAD train. I stayed on for GOMAD about two months and continued with SS until March 2012 at which I weighed at my highest, 145lbs. I loved the strength gains I made on SS but I felt and looked bloated physically. At that point I decided to transition to 5/3/1 bodybuilding template in hopes of progressing my strength while adding some hypertrophy. So this where I'm at currently with my lifts:

- OHP: 115 lb x 5
- DL: 330 lb x 5
- Squat: 265 lb x 1
- Bench: 170 lb x 5

Funny enough I am now looking to transition to Madcow 5x5 because I've hit a wall with my squat on 5/3/1 and struggle with any weight past 235 lb. The plan is to do half gomad and bulk to 160 lbs by next year. It was probably wasn't too wise transitioning from a daily linear progress program to a monthly linear progress program. Enough with the talk, you can find the pictures below.

A little background:

I use the gym at work to do Simple Fit.  Unfortunately, work was renovating the gym last week and I didn't exactly have a place to do my pull-ups.

For $10 I was able to get in to their gym for a month without having to sign a freaking contract (as I was only going to use it for a week or two).  

I was getting towards the end of my workout (Endurance) so I was really starting to work for those push-ups.  Apparently, I let out too many ""grunts and panting"" for a woman on a treadmill and she complained to the Fitness Instructor.

The Fitness Instructor (James) came over and said that the woman complained that I was making too much noise.  He looked at her, gave her the thumbs up.  He turned back to me and said ""give me five minutes, and then continue working out.""

Pretty close to five minutes the woman finishes working out, smiles smugly at me and walks away leaving her treadmill area a disaster area.  The Fitness Instructor catches up with her and talks with her.  She starts arguing with him and he escorts her to the front desk where the argument continues with the clerk at the front.

The instructor walks back to me and said he understood where I'm coming from and that he has no problem with the way I'm working out.  He had been looking for a reason to kick that woman out for several weeks.  Apparently she never wipes down her equipment, talks incessantly to other members (despite their ignoring her) and leaves empty water bottles and towels laying around.  He used her run-in with me to show his manager that she was interrupting other members workouts (which is true) and had apparently pointed me just sitting there looking chastised waiting for her to finish.

He thanked me by offering me another month of membership for free (no that I really need it).",,False,,t5_2qhx4,False,,,True,t3_rl4xc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rl4xc/thank_you_planet_fitness_fitness_instructor/,

Apologies on the quality of the before photo - I never thought to take a proper one for comparison. 

Some details:

**Stats**

Male, Age 21, 5'10""

Weight: 193lb to 166lb

Body Fat: approx 22% to ~9/10% (estimates from Body Fat Friday)

**Story / Motivation**

Split from girlfriend of 4 years, and felt run down, chubby and unattractive. Luckily I'd just become addicted to reddit and found /r/fitness, read the FAQ and got started. 

The first few weeks were really grueling and I had to really nag at myself to go to the gym or control my diet, but it just became routine after a short while. I'd be lying to say my primary goal isn't aesthetics, but I've now realised how much I value feeling strong, capable, healthy and active. 

I am so grateful for /r/fitness, and the FAQ. I still read it every few weeks to brush up on everything, and I link it on to anyone wanting to get fit.

I've just turned 21, graduated my engineering degree and am about to make a 2 month trip to the U.S with friends (we're Aussies). It feels great to be moving on to the next stage in my life feeling happy with myself. 

**Diet**

First 3 months was around 2100 calories per day which got me down to 173lb, a weight I was pretty happy with. The next 3 months I went up to about 2800 per day, except for the last 2 weeks where I've been on a [PSMF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Sparing_Modified_Fast) at around 1200 calories per day (for [reddit's BTFC challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/BTFC/comments/mh1is/completion_20m510_166lb/))

Never paid too much attention to getting exact macronutrients other than protein, which I kept &gt;180g per day. 

Trying to maximise protein and minimise carbs is always what has worked best for me when cutting weight. In the period that I was eating ~2800 calories, I was getting nearly all of my carbs post workout which seemed to help muscle recovery and prevent too much fat gain. 


**Exercise**

First 3 months, followed SL5x5 - but with rows instead of cleans, and added pull ups nearly every session. 

Next 3 months, switched to a 4 day split with 3-4 sets of 10 reps on each exercise. Split days into chest/triceps, back/biceps, shoulders, legs. Made sure to keep all the major compound exercises (dead, squat, bench, OHP, pull ups, rows) and I use free weights as much as possible.

I did HIIT on 2 off days a week for the very first month and felt it helped boost the fat loss, but stopped when the Touch Football season started. Touch is an awesome HIIT/cardio workout and very tiring. 

Since the touch season ended about 2 months ago, I haven't done any cardio. Cutting body fat has been all about maintaining a calorie deficit through dieting.

**Lifts**

Starting 5RM: Deadlift 110, Squat 120, Bench 85

Current 10RM: Deadlift 240, Squat 230, Bench 145


**Supplements**

Used whey protein from the beginning, to make my protein totals. 5g of Creatine per day over the last 3 months. The creatine seemed to give me a bit of a boost, especially at the end of the 10 rep sets.

**Thanks /r/fitness** for the best birthday ever!

I thought I would post this for anyone that just wants to learn more, or be better informed, or even just understand why.",860,360,459,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ko6zt/i_use_steroids_legally_i_thought_i_would_post/,"**If you have any questions, or don't feel comfortable posting directly, please send me a PM.  I am totally cool with chatting and sharing any and all info that I have with anyone that is interested.**

It’s also ok if you want to rage/hate/down vote – I brought my flame shield and this is a throwaway.  Please grab your soap box and rain brimstone if it will make you feel better.  I don’t mind.

I spent quite a long time doing the research, and weighed all the costs and benefits, before I made my decision.  I am not involved in sports, or any competition.  Some individuals, even after hearing that, still feel inclined to accuse me of cheating.

It’s ok if they feel that way.  We each choose our own road.  Even if we both work as hard during any given workout, in the long run the all natural strength trainer will put in more hard work, more effort, and more dedication to get to the same place as me.  They deserve to feel proud of that.  I am cool with that.

I’m not in competition with anyone.  I do this because it makes me feel good.  I think steroids are about efficiency, and that is something that matters to me.  I am not trying to be bigger, or stronger, than anyone else.  I work out at home, alone, just because I like the way it makes me feel.

I know about the side effects.  I know about the risks and the dangers.  So far I haven’t experienced any problems.  Maybe I am lucky.  Maybe I am tempting fate.

But, to date, I have been pleased with the results.

I’m happy to talk about it.  I’m cool with the lecture, if you feel compelled to give one.  I think an open dialogue, no matter the content, is always valuable.

**EDIT**:  A lot of people are asking for pics, claiming BS.  I didn't come here to share pics.  Sorry if that's what you assumed.  Instead I offer you this; my breakdown of how you can get started legally.

First do a goggle search for TRT clinic (it doesn't matter where they are located).  Fill out the contact form on all of them.  Wait for the phone calls to start rolling in.

Next take your pick of who to proceed with.  I was timid at first, worried I wouldn't qualify, and accepted and paid for the first clinic that offered therapy.  I paid WAY too much.

These clinics focus on sales volume for their pharmaceuticals.  You will only ever talk to a sales rep.  They will try to upsell you.  Counter with a request for a price list.  If they refuse at least ask for prices for medication you are specifically interested in.

Make your decision based on a given clinic's prices as well as their willingness to meet your treatment demands.  You have a lot of options to choose from, and they are all vying for your lucrative business.  Be discerning.

After that you will need blood work.  They will coordinate an appointment with a local place.  You will probably pay, over the phone, about $200-$250.  They will setup a time for you to show up and get a bit of blood drawn.  The results will be sent to your clinic.

Next is a physician's exam.  The clinic will probably send you a form.  Just schedule an appointment and ask your doc to give you a physical and fill out the form.  If you are worried about what your doctor thinks of you then tell him/her it is for work, or sports, or your mental health.  Afterwards you will fax/mail it to the clinic.

The final step is a medical background form.  If you have ever been to the doc you have seen one.  They are usually online.  There is a chance a rep might call you to ""coach"" you through filling it out...

Afterwards they will call you within a couple days.  The doctor will have looked it over, and based on your blood results, physical, and background, give you a prescription (all of this relayed through a ""patient coordinator"").  They will try to upsell you some injectable vitamins, and who knows what all else.  Be smart, stick to your guns, only buy what you want.

Costs can range from $400 for a low 200mg/week test dosage all the way up to $1200 for a heavy oxandrolone script (and all necessary pins, SERMs, HCG, sharps container, etc).  You will pay over the phone.  Medication will be mailed to your house within a couple days.

You will get a call with info on how to do the injections.  They suck.  The first time you stick a 1.5"" needle into your ass is the worst.  But it offers about as much resistance as sticking a needle into a warm stick of butter.  There is almost zero pain.  Your ass WILL be sore the next day, and maybe even the day after.

Test-c and other steroids like Nadrolone have long half lives.  They can take up to 3 or 4 weeks to build up to mostly maximum quantities in your blood.  Be patient.  When you start waking up with a daily erection you can assume it is starting to kick in.

Most clinics, in the interest of profit, will push a constant, recurring cycle (no down time, no PCT).  You can fight this.  Be smart and get what you want.

After that?  Chow the fuck down and work hard.  Enjoy the surprising progress.  Enjoy the weight loss.

Make sure to constantly evaluate the benefit to cost/risk.  Establish goals and ask yourself if you are getting closer to them.  Make sure you are getting what you want.  Have your doc check your cholesterol, liver panels, etc.  Be healthy.  Be safe.  Be smart.

**EDIT 2**

A recurring theme for a counter argument is ""you haven't reached X point, so why use steroids?  What is the rush?""

I counter that we are all interested in pushing efficiency.  We voice it with our use of supplements, our inquiries over the most effective quantities of nutrients, protein, or creatine intake.  We voice it in our quest to find the ideal number of reps and sets.  I simply push efficiency further than some.

**FINAL EDIT**

The reaction to a post about such a taboo subject has been a revelation.  Despite my fears that I would face significant criticism, anger, and even outright hate, I have instead found myself confronted with a great deal of honest curiosity, acceptance, and even support.

I think I am about finished answering questions in this post now.  But if anyone would like more information, or just wants to chat, then please send me a message.

Nutrition: Real food. Nothing processed (this means no grains, no sugar), don't even go to the grocery store anymore, I just buy everything from the local farmer's market and spend half as much as I used to. Veggies veggies veggies and TONS of good fat (literally eat 1 slice of bacon every day) from excellent quality meat (grass-fed) and dairy (grass-fed, organic). Very little to no fruit. Sounds restrictive and boring but I can assure you it's not!

Training: I used to wander around the free weight section of my commercial gym like a lost puppy because I just didn't know what to do...and then I met my wonderful bf and he got me into a real strength &amp; conditioning facility (not a machine in sight!) and so I had no choice but to get over my fear and learn. I started off doing group strength classes 4-5x/wk and then slowly started doing my own thing because I enjoyed it so much. When I first started I could barely deadlift 80lbs and now I can do 200lbs. I've also recently taken up olympic lifting with the goal of entering my first competition in June. I squat every single day (none of that half-squat bs either, only ATG for me) and I'm now approaching a bodyweight front squat and back squat 1RM. 

So please ladies, do not be afraid to lift heavy, it will make you look amazing and your confidence will go through the roof.

Apologies for poor quality pics.,693,198,298,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/y0px4/stopped_listening_to_broscience_and_got_educated/,"Hi guys, im 22, from Ireland and have been working out for around 5 years on and off. 

I have always found it really hard to put on weight, i'd use the term 'ectomorph' but I feel people use that as an excuse, I know i did anyway. So I really wanted to try gain some muscle and take things serious and see what 'genetic potential' is. I was sick of hearing ""lots of reps for definition"" or ""just do a dirty bulk since your an ectomorph"". It was time I learned to diet, train and rest all over again. Everyone in my family just figured its another fad but here is the proof that education is all you need to really get the ball rolling.

This is a photo of me 18 months ago compared with a photo of me tonight. (Granted the posing is pretty bad but hey, I'm not a bodybuilder, and my phone set to a 10 second timer doesn't help with things). 

http://i.imgur.com/pBpR6.jpg

So anyway i just wanted to share some of my progress with you guys as its nice to get a little recognition from people who know their stuff. Plus im too shy to post anything like this on fb cause I don't want everything thinking I'm one of those guys that likes to show off his muscles as I'm generally in hoodie's and well covered up.. 

If i can do this, anyone can.

**EDIT** front pic. keep in mind that this is with a crappy camera, bad lighting, and not 1 bit pumped... hope its ok [unflexed/flexed](http://i.imgur.com/Gj3a0.jpg) *this should also redeem the symmetry of my arms :)*

Edit: it's getting late 3.04am and I need some beauty sleep, tried to answer most q's but I'm literally overwhelmed by the response. I will deliver the diet and some more pics soon. I'll even show the legs so the power lifters can sleep easy :) 

EDIT 2 : **Here comes the diet you have all been waiting for**. *I might post more pics later on but i have to study for an exam too so this is all i can do right now*

Before i begin, let me remind you that this is the sample diet that is *currently* working for me. Everyone will hit plateaus and feel as if they are not gaining. That's when its time to switch it up again. This is the template i have followed for almost 2 years (granted its not as detailed as i would like to have made it but i dont have the time this weekend). I'm sure i'll forget some stuff but i'll try get everything i can in. I also work 9-5 6 days a week so sometimes i miss a meal or 2.

8am -- mass gainer shake (nutribolics mass fusion) with a banana plus my multivitamin. 

10.30 -- 6 egg whites with 2 yolks and a pro-biotic yoghurt

1pm -- 250g of sliced turkey on wholemeal wrap and an apple/sometimes same as 6.00 meal just prepacked)

3.30pm -- protein bar (im generally sitting at a desk and cant get any proper food at this time)

6.00pm -- (pre workout meal) 150g of basmati rice with 8oz of chicken breast/steak/turkey. Green 
beans/broccoli/mixed veg

7.00pm -- workout (take bcaa's on way to the gym)

8.20pm -- (Post workout shake) myofusion/dymatize or any whey isolate blend. Creatine mono 5-8g's

11pm -- 150g wholegrain rice or pasta with 8oz of chicken breast/steak/turkey Green beans/broccoli/mixed veg

12.30-1.00am -- between 8-10 egg whites (slow release protein throughout the night) 

Take in as much water as you can throughout the day especially if you are taking creatine with your supps. i generally take in between 5-7 litres a day

Like i said guys this is just a rough template that enables me to hit my daily macros. I often have to mix meals up or change things a little bit. We are all different so find out what works best for you.

I didn't see you again until a week later when you were with the trainer again so I assumed you were going to the gym when I wasn't.

Fast forward to yesterday. I hadn't seen you in a few months (I was on vacation for 4 weeks and hadn't been at the gym for awhile) and was shocked at your change. You were doing a walk around the gym while carrying about 50 pounds in weights. Your back was straight. Your face was NOT red but instead had a look of confidence! And you had definitely lost weight! I'd say close to 20lbs.

You were in the zone so I didn't feel like saying this to you personally. So on Reddit I say to you ""Fuck yeah dude! You're doing it!"".

I'm not sure if the 300g increase in my muscle mass is within the margin of error of the DXA, so I can't say ""I gained muscle while losing fat"", but it's clear that I didn't lose any.  I did have 2 weeks of maintenance calories at the end of my cut before getting scanned as well.

The first thought that went through my head was ""Jesus christ, I look huge."" 

First picture - Me at on or about 230lbs: http://imgur.com/zPpT9

 I was working a very stressful job and going to school full time, plus any free time I had was with the girlfriend. The worst part about the whole deal was I never really understood how big I actually was. I had always enjoyed lifting weights and going to the gym but life shit kept me oblivious to reality. I always thought I was just ""a bit overweight and I'm still in good shape."" (haha oh god...) 

Long story short, I broke up with the girlfriend around Feb (I was probably even bigger) and I suddenly found myself with an extra few hours everyday. I decided to hit the gym hard like I had done before and lost about a good 30-40lbs in a few weeks. Co-workers were seriously worried about me cause they thought I was sick or something due to the drastic weight loss. 

Second picture - Me around 180ish: http://imgur.com/anlhQ

This is a more healthy weight I think, ha. 

My stats: 

5'10-5'11 depending on the day 
bench: 315x5, 365 pr
squat: err...I don't do very heavy squats because I am afraid of them...315 was the most I've ever done. 

- Form is my number 1 focal point in the gym, I never lift heavy if I cannot maintain proper form.

- I go the gym about 5-6 times a week, each day gets a muscle group (Mon-chest, Tues-bis, Weds-shoulders, Thurs-tris, Fri-legs, Sat-back). I do abs about every other day.

- Diet is pretty lax. I feel like fat loss is so exaggerated and people just want to find something easy to do. 3500cals is a pound, I was fat. I wanted to x amount of pounds, thats how much I needed to burn.

   1) I watched what I ate, no cheat days cause I was fat. Spinach, non-fat greek yogurt, non-fat cottage cheese, chicken, beef, fish, quinoa, lentils, beans...etc.

   2) I used (still do) protein and creatine. I take fish oil and flax.

   3) Cardio was done on the eliptical machine cause I hate  running, did it twice a day for a month straight. About 40 mins HIIT. Again, I was fat and I wanted to lose weight.

I was actually more muscular and leaner a few weeks ago before finals and whatnot came up. For the summer, I plan to lose about another 5-10lbs and get cut up even more.

Weight is on the picture.
I started out by going from Regular pop to diet. Diet then later became either water, diet sierra mist, or naked fruit drinks.
Then I cut back on pastas and bread. I didn't do a full Atkins diet. I just went off the premise I was probably taking in way to many carbs. I eat more now days but nothing like donuts. Fruits and Veggies when I can of course. 

Workout really isn't much. I work at a factory now and so I walk about 5-6 miles a day. I haven't even started up a steady work out routine yet. I will walk around our park or do some push ups from time to time but yea. It's been a slow process but it's yielded me progress. 

Edit- for all that are asking I'm 6'1"". Some work buddies and I are going to start up p90x and put money in a pool for progress. We are all competitive lol. Thanks for the encouragement.

It comes and goes, and so I can easily and clearly identify all of the symptoms that come along with it.

The biggest component of that depression (for me) is apathy.  When I've got it under control and I think about what I want to eat or what I want to accomplish for the day, I have sensible meals and I exercise and I feel really great about myself.  The last time I was feeling like that, I ended up losing 70 lbs. in five months.

Then I get depressed again and those same decisions sound more like, ""I'll just have these extra tacos because today sucked, and I'll work them off tomorrow.""  Or, ""Why bother working out today if I'm already feeling miserable?  I'll do it when I feel better.""

So Fittit, my question to you is, has anyone actually managed to improve their physical health while they were depressed?  Is it possible at all, or do I have to get my head right to get the rest of me to follow along?  How did you manage to do it?

**TL;DR I can't motivate myself to eat right or exercise when I'm depressed.  Is it possible?**

EDIT:  Lots of responses and I thank you all for every one of them.  Even the ""stop being a pussy"" ones got a laugh from me, so thanks.  Just wanted to clarify that 
1) Yes I've been getting professional help for my depression for 8 years, but sadly depression is not my only health problem and (long story short) meds are not a great solution for me.  
2) Lots of recommendations to try shrooms (for both the depression and the migraines), but I'm not sure hallucinogens are a great idea with my current frame of mind.
3) I just got done playing the drums for almost two full hours and I'm covered in sweat and my hands are blistered.

It was my last set and I was making my way on the last few reps, struggling and grunting, eye closed trying to force out my last few reps.

Honestly, had he not been there I would have stopped after one last rep. But he encouraged me to push out 3 more (with a little bit of help on the last 2). But it felt great to do those last ones. After i finished he walked away and said 'good work bud', and with what air i had left I thanked him. 

I just wanted to say thank you, to everyone that goes to the gym and is willing to help others out. To the people who will stop you so they can wipe down the benches before you sit down. To the people who people who are patient while you finish your sets and don't steal your weights.

My future goals are to tighten up my stomach and triceps. I plan on continuing the program but I am always up for a new challenge if anyone has suggestions for a great workout.

As I say in the video, it's more for the fascia than it is for your muscles. That said, it will effectively target the pectoralis minor, superior trapezius, and levator scapulae muscles (along with the scalenes and SCM if you draw your head back). This makes it especially good for people with neck and upper back pain from running, and anyone who finds their head forward and their shoulders up around their ears.

I don't say this in the video because I don't want any newbies to hurt themselves, but gently moving your head while doing the stretch can really target scalenes and superior traps. Use with caution. Thanks for watching, r/fitness.

If there was a gold medal in sitting on my ass and staring at a computer screen while building up tension in my shoulders, my job would be perfect training. Given that I like to relax in my spare time with PC gaming, I'd be a good candidate for the 400m anterior pelvic tilt, too. Standing desks aren't a viable option for me at home or at work.

So, obviously, the answer is to work out. But that's not the only answer. What I want to do is find ways to hack my activity level so that instead of being totally sedentary 99% of the time and working out four times a week, I'm marginally more active throughout the whole day. This isn't a substitute for working out regularly - it's an extra.

I'm working on ways to sneak exercise into my routine, or find more active ways of doing things I've gotta do every day anyway. The idea is to get a list of options and try and make several of them into long-term habits. Here's the list so far - all suggestions and additions would be very, very welcome.

* Always sprint the last few yards to the bus/train/your car, even if you're not late.
* Get off the bus/train a stop early/late, walk the rest. Or park at a distance.
* Intentionally get on a bus/train that gets you to a stop further away than the one you'd normally get, walk the rest.
* Always take the stairs.
* Set an alarm to go off every hour while gaming. Stop gaming, do 5-10 minutes of exercise, reset alarm, start gaming again.
* Put pull-up bar in doorway at home, do pull-ups every time you walk through.
* Use half an hour of your lunch break to explore the area around your office on foot. Find a pleasant walk (if you can) and walk it at breaks. Bonus: de-stress.
* Stand up during meetings, if it's socially acceptable to do so. If you can, stand on one leg. Subtly.
* Always offer to do the coffee run.
* Set an alarm to remind you to stand up and stretch every hour at your desk.
* Leg exercises while brushing teeth - BW squats, lunges. Time for 3min for simultaneous quad exercise and dental hygiene. Wall sit while you floss.
* Always give up your seat if the bus/train is full.

1320070033.0,482,self.Fitness,lv5lx,How I worked my way up to [f]ull pull-ups,806,324,241,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/lv5lx/how_i_worked_my_way_up_to_full_pullups/,"""Can you do a pull-up?"" seems to be the fit female equivalent of ""how much you bench, brah?"". So many ladies want to be able to do them, but I rarely see girls at the gym training to do so in a meaningful way. I struggled for years and tried everything, and finally found exercises that worked. I can now do 5-7 dead-hang pronated-grip pull-ups. So I thought I'd type this up in case there are any ladies for whom this might be helpful.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:

-[Lat pulldowns](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/LatissimusDorsi/CBFrontPulldown.html). There are key differences between the lat pulldown machine and a pull-up. The biggest one is that [lat pulldowns are open-chain, pull-ups are closed-chain](http://www.functionalps.com/blog/?p=1117). Additionally, with the lat pulldown you are able to brace your legs against the pad that sits over your quads; obviously you can't do this with a pull-up.

-[Assisted pull-up machine](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/LatissimusDorsi/AsPullup.html). While I like it better than the lat pulldown and it's a decent exercise, it's completely useless for working your way up to a full pull-up. The biomechanics are completely different. Even in a dead hang (non-kipping) pull-up, you're not moving in a completely straight line. So much of pull-ups is motor learning, plus you recruit a lot of muscles as stabilizers and synergists (i.e. abs) that you don't really tap into with the assisted machine. It's just a very different movement. With a pull-up, you're retracting your scapulae and pulling *back* (more on this in a bit), on the assisted machine, because of how the counterweight works you're pulling more upward. ETA: A lot of people are commenting about the assisted machine. I do think it's a decent exercise for building a base of strength, and it's certainly better than lat pulldowns, but you will probably reach a point where you have to switch to something else to bridge to a full pull-up. I once helped a girl who wasn't strong enough to even do a single rack chin; if you're that weak the assisted machine might be a decent option.

WHAT I DO LIKE:

-[Rack chins](http://imgur.com/LHRcR) (that picture shows them with a barbell, just do them with body weight). This is pretty darn close to a pull-up but it cuts your body weight by quite a bit so you're not hauling up as much. I also like it because you train that squeeze at the top where you clear the bar, whereas the assisted machine helps you too much there. ETA: You can do these on the Smith machine.

-[Inverted rows](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/BackGeneral/BWSupineRow.html). These hit the back muscles a bit differently, plus you get good practice retracting the scapulae (the key to doing pull-ups, especially pronated grip IMO). ETA: You can do these on the Smith machine as well.

-Jump pull-ups with slow negatives. Jump up to the top position and sloooowly lower yourself down. As you get better you'll be able to pull yourself up at the top part (the hardest part is overcoming the inertia at the bottom). I really like these for ""greasing the groove"". You don't necessarily have to do them to failure, just get a pull-up bar (i.e. a doorway one) and do one or two every time you pass it.

-[Band-assisted pull-ups](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmLa2czq49Y). I like these because they just assist you at the bottom (the hardest part) rather than helping you the whole way through. I like these for when you're able to do partial ROM pull-ups but not a full one.

-Push-ups, for strengthening the antagonist muscles. Bench press is good too but I prefer push-ups for beginners and I like the fuller ROM.

KEYS TO PROPER FORM

-Supinated, pronated, or neutral grip are all fine. My favorite is actually to use gymnastic rings because they allow my hands to fall into a natural position. 

-Focus on retracting your scapulae and pulling back!!

-For inverted rows, your chest must touch the bar or it doesn't count. If you're not strong enough, either do them [on hips](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/BackGeneral/BWSupineRowHips.html) or dig your heels in a bit for an assist.

-For rack chins, keep your torso upright. Chin must clear the bar. If you're not strong enough, you can dig your heels into the bench for an assist, but it's better if you don't.

INCORPORATING THIS INTO A ROUTINE

SL 5x5: Replace barbell rows with 3xF supine rows in workout A and add 3xF push-ups to failure. Add 3xF rack chins for workout B. ""Grease the groove"" with jump pull-ups to negatives (or just find some time during the week where you can do them). Once you can do partial ROM pull-ups, swap the rack chins for band-assisted pull-ups.

SS: Basically the same as above, add supine rows and push-ups to workout A and rack chins to workout B, etc.

Hope this helps someone!

**tl;dr**: Lat pulldowns and assisted machine are not particularly useful; rack chins (feet on chair or a bench), inverted rows, and jump pull-ups to negatives are much better; band-assisted and partial ROM pull-ups are great once you're able to do them.",,False,,t5_2qhx4,True,,,True,t3_lv5lx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/lv5lx/how_i_worked_my_way_up_to_full_pullups/,

I looked like a bloody meth head, or like Christian Bale from the Machinist.  Two years of hard work (dieting was the toughest part, I hate eating) has led me to today.

I am posting this not so much to get karma, but for those people looking for motivation.  With hardwork you can accomplish anything and overcome whatever genes, work ethic, or body type you were born with.  Transforming your body is not a quick thing, it's a slow and steady battle.  I think it's super important to take monthly progress pictures and stats, otherwise it's tough to ""see"" your results.  

I am still planning on continuing the journey of gaining weight, I'd like to weigh a clean 195, and then re-evaluate at that time.

Anyway, here's the pics

1362933433.0,472,self.Fitness,1a11cc,The German Volume Training Experiment: Completed,626,154,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1a11cc/the_german_volume_training_experiment_completed/,"Hello again fittit, I have returned. After 60 days of severe pain, soreness and discomfort, I am back to report in. It works, unfortunately for me, not as well as I was expecting.

THE WORKOUT:
I used the original can be found here: http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/441/German_Volume_Training.aspx

And before you ask, it is NOT a weekly split, it is a FIVE day split (after day five, you repeat day one, you don't go M through F then rest all weekend.)

BACKGROUND:

I'll keep this short and simple. My background is a fatass who got into shape. This was and was me: [http://i.imgur.com/Duf7c.jpg
](http://i.imgur.com/Duf7c.jpg)

My routine before this was a modified SS program that I made work for me, the A/B day splits, and running 6.5 or 7 miles in an hour on T/Th.

I really have no expertise in lifting (high school or otherwise), and just did this because there wasn't anything on GVT in reddit that I could tell. Please pardon my lack of science.

METHODOLOGY:

The idea behind the routine, a LOT of volume at about 65% your max weight. There are two halves to this, the ""beginner"" half where you do 10 sets of 10 reps, and an ""intermediate"" half where you do 10 sets of 6 reps.

DIET &amp; SUPPLEMENTS:

This is pretty important. You gotta eat. More than probably what you just though. I ate a LOT of food. On days where I wasn't forced to eat fast food (seriously, I'm a full time student with 2 internships and a job. I literally COULD NOT get around it) my diet stuck almost exactly to this: [http://i.imgur.com/QF1tSmC.png](http://i.imgur.com/QF1tSmC.png)

Also, it is HIGHLY important to note that sleep is also important as your diet. I NEVER got less than seven hours of sleep except twice, and it made me absolutely miserable. My advice is to aim for 8 hours.

The supplements I took itemized:

* Package containing Oxan-VR, 3-Test-OXO, and NGH-t

* Orange Triad multivitamin

* Mega Shred fish oil

* Assault pre-workout

* Anabolic 60 whey 

DISCUSSION:

I was warned going into this that it is incredibly brutal. After doing it, I personally wouldn't recommend this to beginning lifters and would even have some reservations about some intermediate lifters attempting this particular program. Don't get me wrong, it is a very good program (I feel), but there are a few things that would concern me:

* Lack of discipline - this routine will pound your will power into the ground. If you aren't as mentally strong as you are physically, there is no way in hell you're going to make it past 100 squat day.

* Lack of proper form - it is VERY important you have good form while doing all of these lifts. I almost injured myself due to misunderstanding ""bent knee deadlifts"" was actually ""Romanian Deadlifts"" and attempted to slowly lower heavier than necessary deadlift weight.

* Failure to adhere to tempo - This is incredibly important - you can power through the workout no problem, but doing it at the prescribed tempo can literally make all the difference, since all the difference is doing this program right.

* Not knowing your limits - there were 3 instances of the 60 day span where I had failed during my lifts, once during an incline bench, nearly crushing my head. Another was during the close grip bench, providing a sore rib cage for a couple days. The last one was the bent over rows I was having difficulty doing correctly the first day.

* Joint pain - as you probably guessed, this particular routine is absolutely vicious on your joints. I wanted to cry on 100 dip days. The worst offender of this was just that day though, but it may be different for every body.

PROGRESSION:

The program went fairly well I think.

RESULTS:

I did all of my core lifts before going into the GVT program. The numbers before and after stayed remarkably the same, and my maxes even fault ""easy"" compared to how hard they use to be.

SQUAT - 315x5x3

OHP - 135x5x3

DEADLIFT - 405x5x1

BENCH - 225x5x3

PC - 185x5x3

I would also like to report there was no loss of strength during this program, and after the DOMS end I intend to see if I can get any gains from it.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO BE ADDED LATER:

Since I'm having a hard time getting a moment to add the rest, I figured I'd go ahead and state that I'll add the ""after"" BF% once the machine gets fixed at my university. I am also working on an excel document for each day and the weight for each one. Gotta rush out the door now, will update later.

(Before BF% was 8.5....I'm GUESSING it is probably around 10-12% maybe?)

Even though it is a pretty good story, I'm sure I'm not unique enough to think that someone else out there doesn't have a better story. So let's here them. Here's mine:

I was jogging down a road on the outside of town surrounded by farm land. A car full of hooligans drove by and they shouted obscenities at me as they did. So naturally, I flipped them the bird. Not just the standard bird, but the full on double-douce! I notice brake lights on the car as it crests the top of a small hill (just large enough to obscure my vision of the road). Then the car comes speeding back down the road. They were in the correct lane so I didn't freak out. But then this shaggy haired guy leans almost completely out the back driver's side window with something in his hand. I froze. And there with his brown curly locks flowing in the wind, he proceeds to roll a gold, sparkly bowling ball from the window of a speeding car directly at me.

TL:DR dude rolls a bowling ball at me from a speeding car while I'm jogging

I worked hard, and went from 240 to 210 pounds (I'm 6'4"") I finally have a body I'm comfortable with and feel great. 

However, I saw the first true results tonight. For the past few days I have been hanging out with a group of girls at my school. I had my eye on one of them because she was really pretty, and we seemed to get along. I met her last year, but would have never had the balls to do anything about it. This year was different, I laid the groundwork carefully the past 2 days and then made my move tonight. We flirted all night and are going out on a real date tomorrow. 

So basically I want to thank you Fittit. You all were a big inspiration over the past few months and I hope to get in even better shape as the months go on.

Workout:

I did my best to combine a heavy amount of cardio with a decent amount of weights. My schedule usually 
looked like this.

Monday/Wednesday: AM - Upper body lifts and a bike ride
PM - Rec League Ultimate Frisbee (Awesome source of cardio)

Tuesday/Thursday: AM - Canoe/Swim (I live on a lake during the summer)
PM - Pickup Soccer

Friday: AM - Weights and Bikeride

Saturday/Sunday - Usually fit in some sort of exercise on one day and then rested on the other.

Diet:
I ate what I wanted usually, with a few exceptions, but I brought my calorie intake down to about 2000.
Cut out pretty much all dairy.
Ate no forms of dessert.

I know that the point of Fittit is to provide inspiration with before/after photos, and I wish I could do a better job of that because I know it helped me a lot. But the main point of this post was to thank Fittit for helping me to get my self confidence back and to enforce the point that my losing weight didn't lead to her saying yes (that I know of), but it led to me finally having the balls to ask her.

I have always been a skinny kid and just assumed that no matter how much I ate I would never gain weight, Started lifting in January 2011 and found this subreddit, which then I realized that i really just wasn't eating enough.

**Info**
Last January I was 6 foot, now I am 6'1.
17 Years old. Went from 145lb to 182lb as of today.

**Diet**
This is the area that was least strict, I don’t follow a specific diet or do any meal timing, but a good day for me would include
Meal 1: 3 egg omelette with cheese and sliced turkey/chicken, and a glass of 2% milk.
Meal 2: Either 2 sliced chicken sandwiches or chicken and rice/quinoa with sriracha.
Meal 3: Something small like a protein bar/shake and yoghurt, or the lunch tuna package with the crackers.
Meal 4: Dinner- Whatever my parents make, could be anything from pasta with meat sauce, to burgers/chicken+rice/steak.
Meal 5: Protein shake and cliff bar

Lots of milk throughout the day

Like I said these meals could differ from day to day.

Supplements: Muscle pharm Assault, ON whey protein, C4 PWO

**Stats**
All stats are 5RM

Bench Press: 95lb--&gt;175lb

OHP: 65lb--&gt;115lb

Squat: 95lb--&gt;205lb

Deadlift: 95lb--&gt;235lb

**Workout Routine**

Up until about 4 weeks ago I had been focusing on doing every exercise 3x5, but then realized that I should incorporate bodybuilding ideals into my workouts. 
So now for my main compound lifts I do 4x5 to still increase strength, but then after that I focus on hitting the 8-12 rep range.

**Monday** Chest/Biceps
DB or barbell flat bench

DB or barbell incline bench

Weighted chin ups

Preacher curls

Cable flies superset with cross overs

Incline chest flies

**Tuesday** Legs

Squats

Front squats

Leg curls

Leg press

Calf raises

**Wednesday** Back
Pendlay rows
Cable rows
Bent over rows
Pull ups

**Thursday** Shoulders/Triceps

OHP

Dips

Shrugs

Farmers walk

Tricep extensions

Raises

Upright row

Arnold press

**Friday**

Rest

**Saturday** Full body

This is when I deadlift

Front squat

Pullups

Clean and jerk

**Sunday**

You will notice that this is basically Zyzz's routine that someone posted here a few months back.

**Extra**

My goals are to keep gaining to 190-195 and then possibly lean out from there, Throughout all of the weight gain I still feel as if I still don't have very high bf% but maybe thats just genetics.

Being a nice guy and good friend, I'll take to the internet here to tell them, and everyone with the same attitude, to shut the hell up. Okay, that was rude. Just, y'know, chill out.

Diet sodas have zero calories, no carbohydrates and no sugar. Mathematically speaking, it's IMPOSSIBLE for the soda itself to make me gain weight. The reason people gain weight in the studies is because people who drink diet sodas eat more of EVERYTHING ELSE. The lack of sugar in a diet soda means a person's appetite won't be squelched like a regular soda or sugary drink will, so people tend to eat more of the other nasty foods they usually eat to make up for it.

The diet drink I have once a day to not go insane with the water and Crystal Light will not make me fat. So stop telling me it will.

Anyways, i'm babbling. Yesterday I went shopping and realized I fit into a size 14 which is smaller than I was in high school. I'm no longer an XL. (depending on where you live. I live in Canada). I couldn't be more excited. Honestly, I don't really care what I look like because in my humble opinion, i've always been pretty but being healthy has become very important to me and I'm loving the push. 

Thanks for all your inspiration here guys. It's because of you all that I've been able to keep pushing!! &lt;3

Just watched this BBC documentary last night and found it really interesting. I think this may at least partly debunk the whole ""fast vs. slow metabolisms"" debate. Turns out that some people just naturally feel the urge to eat more than their bodies need, while others naturally feel the urge to eat less, or just the right amount. The first group of people are those that tend to become overweight (and attribute it to genetic factors), while the second group tends to become the skinny, hardgainer, ""I can't gain weight no matter how much I eat"" type of person. So really, your body weight is not a result of how fast or slow your metabolism is, but rather how much you eat naturally and the weight your body wants you to be at.

* That inner satisfaction of lifting more and/or having better form than some of the guys there

I literally gained that freshman 20lb (155lb) soon after and didn't really get bothered by it enough to do anything... until I was introduced to some serious r/fitness pictures.

I also started doing Jiu-Jitsu during the middle of the progress which helped a lot as far as physique so shoutout to r/bjj for that!

So I started hitting the gym mid november and these are the results:

Before : http://imgur.com/vOQN0VY

After : http://imgur.com/rUPsOuQ

Progress (155-&gt;140) : http://imgur.com/750uDKT (Top-left to top-right, and then bottom-left to bottom-right!)



My lifts went from ..

Squats(5*5) : 95lb to 165

Overhead press(5*5) : 95lb to 125lb

Bench press (1rm) : 135 to 245



Edit: 

I've been doing the SL 5*5 for overhead press along with Squats constantly. As far as benching goes, I tried doing SL but soon noticed I got a lot more progress from doing pyramid sets (don't see this getting much spotlight on r/fitness but it worked for me?). 

I got a comment about my bench being way over my squats (my posted weight for squats is 5*5 while bench is my 1rm), but that's because I started squatting later than I had hoped. I must admit I neglected squats until r/fitness drove it in my head that squats is so important. I am progressing on squats right now through SL and hoping to get started on deadlifts soon.

As far as diet goes.. I wasn't focusing on diet for the first month or two, just eating a little more clean and not going over macros (wasn't too difficult). This last month though, I actually got a little inspired by keto and somehow kept making gains by just eating a lot of protein and fat instead of carbs.

Edit again*

A decent amount of people are skeptical about my bench press but hopefully this provides some more info behind it..

I benched a decent amount in high school and spontaenously stopped at 195.
Coming back to the gym a few months ago, I saw a lot of increase from 135 really fast and the hard work was 185-245. I benched every other day cause I had little knowledge of taking time to work lower body..

Now my chest size is also something ive been concerned about but its because prior to this I had a concave chest (ribs cave in making a significant ditch in my chest). Fat/muscle had to fill that void before any of my chest started sticking out. A lot of my lifting buddies that are 1rm'ing way less than me have nicer chests than me because of this. Just something I learned to live with (and I know theres surgery for this but it hasnt affected my breathing enough to make insurance cover it).",,False,,t5_2qhx4,1360046084.0,,,True,t3_17wg8f,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/17wg8f/i_was_never_considered_way_overweight_but_after/,

I had vowed to be in the best shape of my life when I turned 30, and I'm happy to say that I've achieved that goal (my birthday was 9/6). I've actually looked like the after picture for a couple of months, but have hit a plateau lately.

*EDIT:* Workout and diet details added below. 

**WORKOUT ROUTINE**

**Day 1:** Biceps, Back, Shoulders, Cardio (all exercises are x3 sets)

* Underhand pull-ups (10 reps)
* Dumbell shoulder shrugs (25 reps)
* T-Bar rows (10 reps)
* Reverse dumbell fly, laying chest-down on incline (12 reps)
* Dumbell lateral raises (15 reps)
* Cable rows (12 reps)
* Barbell curls (12 reps - last set to failure)
* 30-45 minutes of cardio

**Day 2:** Chest, Triceps, Cardio (all exercises are x3 sets)

* Bench press, wide grip (10 reps)
* Dumbell incline press (10 reps)
* Chest fly (10 reps)
* Dips (10 reps)
* Tricep kickbacks (12 reps each arm)
* Tricep pulldowns with rope (12 reps)
* Push ups (25 reps - last set to failure)
* 30-45 minutes of cardio

**Day 3:** Abs, Cardio (all exercises are x3 sets)

* Scissor kick holds (5 reps per leg, 5 seconds per rep)
* One leg toe-touches (10 right / 10 left)
* Side plank (30 seconds each side)
* Seated medicine ball twists (15 reps each direction)
* Roman chair knee raises (10 reps)
* Roman chair straight leg raises (10 reps)
* 30-45 minutes of cardio

**Day 4:** Rest day

------------------------------------------------------------

Up to this point I have avoided leg exercises due to knee issues, but those symptoms have subsided and I will gradually be adding a leg routine on Day 3 (which happens to be today). Also due to those knee problems, I stick to the elliptical for my cardio as opposed to the treadmill. I set the machine to about 50% of max intensity and find that 30-45 minutes burns about 350-500 calories (according to the reading, anyway).

------------------------------------------------------------

**DIET GUIDELINES**

I'm actually not super strict about my diet. I just use basic principles to get through the day.

* Drink lots of water.
* Avoid saturated fats MOST of the time (cheese, butter, sour cream, dressings, etc.)
* Avoid starches and simple carbs MOST of the time (potatoes, pasta, white bread, chips, crackers, etc.)
* Eat as many fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts as I want.
* Try to consume roughly 150 grams of protein.
* Allow myself a cheat meal a couple of times per week. It's not that serious.

I've tried the 6 small meals thing, but I found it was an inconvenience and that I had a tendency to over eat. These days I eat a medium sized lunch, an afternoon snack (usually trail mix), a sizable dinner, and a small protein/carb snack after my evening workout. I intentionally skip breakfast because it tends to upset my stomach. At most I'll have a cup of coffee with no sugar.

It may come as a surprise that I actually eat out most of the time for lunch and dinner. I frequent places like Chick Fil-A (grilled nuggets), Chipotle (burrito bowl), Freebirds (burrito bowl), Cafe Express (turkey burger on wheat bun), and Taco Cabana (chicken fajita tacos on corn tortillas). Yes, it's more expensive than I'd like, but that's the price I pay - literally - for convenience.


**SUPPLEMENTS**

I drink a protein shake on days when I see that I'm going to come up a little short in that area. I prefer the Frosty Chocolate flavor offered by Pure Protein.

Thought I would share my progress with you guys. A year ago I was out of shape. I'm 5'11, 25 years old, and was about 185 pounds and pretty fat. I spent about 4-5 months dropping my weight down to 165 with mostly diet and jogging.

Since then,  I've been busting my butt in the gym for some real change and I feel like I've finally gotten somewhere. 

Here are three progress pictures. I attempted to keep lighting and posing similar (though no pose before I started lifting): 

http://i.imgur.com/ZzdzU.png

The pictures are from End of Feb, June 1st and Today, respectively. 

Weights are approximately 165, 175 and 168. Body fat percentages are approximately 17%, 19% and 8% (measured using a set of calipers). (Note; may note be accurate.)

I started lifting shortly after the first picture was taken. My routine was basically SS minus deadlifts (my back just doesn't like deadlifts), and lots of curls and situps. It was just some bro routine I threw together that I figured would gain me some muscle, since I knew compound exercises were best. 

I didn't really have a diet plan and just ate whatever, though. I put on a bunch of fat, but my lifts went up quite a bit. Nothing spectacular though.

Around june I decided I didn't like the routine or my diet and got serious. I switched to a 3 day split (push/pull/legs) and I've been using it religiously since. I also use a fairly consistent diet now that's high in protein and low in fat.

I think I started to see real progress from here out. I decide to cut/recomposition until the start of august after doing some reading online, and since then I've been on a straight up bulk trying to minimize fat gain.

Pretty happy with the results; what do you guys think?

How I feel: http://i.imgur.com/tO5yq.jpg

Current routine:

Push: Flat Barbell bench, Incline dumbbell press, Hammerpress machine, Machine flyes, Shoulder Press (dumbbell or machine), Tricep pulldown, Lateral raises (dumbbell) 

Pull: Dumbbell bicep curls, Wide grip pullups, Incline dumbbell curls, Rows (I vary these between dumbbell rows, seated cable rows and machine rows), Reverse barbell curls, Barbell curls, Shrugs (dumbbell or barbell), rear delt flyes (dumbbell or machine)  

Legs: Squats, Leg press, Calf extensions, Leg extensions, Leg curls.



Lifts: Bench: 95 -&gt; 180 (10 reps)
Squat: 135 -&gt; 265 (10 reps)


Body changes: I only have a few, but arms have gone from 13.5 -&gt; 15.75 inches, chest has gone from 36 -&gt; 42 inches, waist has gone from 33 -&gt; 28 inches. 

Cheers


Edit: Here are my measurements, if anyone cares

Neck 15.25
Chest 42
Arms 15.75
Forearms 13.25
Wrist 6.5
Waist 28
Hips 37.5
Quads 23.5

I'll try to get back to as many people as I can, but right now I'm going to be stuck in clinic for awhile.


Edit 3: No, I'm not on juice, but thanks for the compliments. 

I was incredibly athletic in the past though. It wasn't until university kicked my ass that I got incredibly out of shape. 

I worked incredibly hard for these results. I've been dedicated to the cause since I started and am going to continue to see where I can push myself.

If you don't believe it, hey, continue to wallow in your mediocrity. I'm fine with that.

Edit 4: I now realize that I hadn't mentioned my level of fitness in highschool. When I was 16 I had a home gym with a bench press, flyes, and leg extensions. I also had dumbbells. I worked out occasionally. You could say I used to bodybuild. It was pretty amateurish though. I was in nowhere near the shape I'm in now, but now that I think about it it probably contributed to my gains. It was almost 9 years ago now though (my mother removed the gym shortly after I got into it); it didn't really cross my my mind when I made the thread.

I also have my black belt in taekwondo, was trained as a life guard and enjoyed badminton and table tennis in my spare time as well as some track (sprinting). 

Hopefully I haven't mislead any of you with that.

http://imgur.com/a/44LAy

For the back lights I picked up two of these: http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/20169658/ they're only $12 each and very bright.

For the spotlight, I already had a light in the ceiling. It's just a regular incandescent bulb but to create more of a spotlight effect I wrapped aluminum foil around it to narrow the light down more. As far as I know aluminum isn't flammable but I'm not responsible if you hurt yourself or burn your house down.

To get some sheen in the skin I used glycerin. You can buy it at the drug store.

I was in the Air Force at the time and could travel overseas with very little out of pocket damage, so it only made sense to run somewhere more interesting then Oklahoma City. We settled on the Rome Marathon, where the course took you throughout the whole city, past most of the historical landmarks while beginning and ending at The Colosseum.

Getting to the point, my training was minimal at best. I continued to drink copious amounts of alcohol and smoke cigars throughout the four month prep period. I wasn’t going to let one long run interrupt the destructive habits I’ve worked so many years to build up. Little did I know there was more to know about running a race than left foot , right foot, repeat.

The race starts, I’m doing fine, and around mile twelve I have an urgent need to shit. Luckily there was a rest stop coming up where they hand out some fruit, water, and have a couple of port-a-johns. Both of the shitters are in use, so I just jog in place to stay warm and wait it out. Looking back on it, I’m not sure if I was sweating more from the run or from this anxious turd pushing on my gut. Finally the door unlocks and out walks an incredibly good looking brunette. As the door is shutting behind her, I notice she left a gift. All over the back of the toilet seat is a nice warm pile of shit. It wasn’t a healthy solid one, no, it was more like a bunch of wet and settled sand.

Like I said, I really had to shit, so I quickly ran over to the attendants handing out water and grab a wet sponge which are used to cool off the runners. I quickly waddle back to the pot and use the sponge to push the shit into the toilet along with the sponge. I got about fifty percent of the sandy shit into the toilet with one swipe, and my body told me that was going to have to do.

Now I’ve always heard my wife and her friend's talk about squatting to avoid the toilet seat. I’ve never tried it before, but this seemed like a good time to give it a go. I’ve never been more wrong in my life.

I pull my sweaty shorts down around my ankles and brace my hands upon the sidewalls of the pot. I can start to hear other runners congregate outside the port-a-john and converse. Knowing there is a line forming doesn’t make this any easier for me.

Slowly, I begin to lower myself down to the squat position and try to shit. I’m holding at about a 45 degree angle, but my butthole doesn’t think this is low enough to open up and drop off the package. So I lower a bit more. Bad idea.

After running twelve miles, the extended static squat starts to fail. I push out harder on the walls for leverage, and start to shake pretty severely. The whole port-a-john is vibrating and my legs are giving out. I tell myself this will not happen! I will not fall down! I will not sit in this strange ladies diarrhea!

Now I’m sitting in somebody elses poop. I make my peace with this and continue to shit my brains out. I can hear the congregation outside growing larger. I go to wipe and of course there’s no fucking toilet paper. It was either used up by the faster runners ahead of me or was never there in the first place. It doesn’t matter now. No amount of toilet paper will make me feel clean again.

So, I just manned the fuck up, pulled my sweaty shorts up around my shit caked ass, and ran back into the race. I made no eye contact with the next guy/girl in line as I exit. I just get out of the situation as fast as I can.

I can only assume, looking back on the experience, that the people after me think I took a sandy shit all over the toilet, and that they also finished the race with shitty ass. Instead of a beautiful women’s poop, it now belongs to some American asshole who used all of the toilet paper.

TL;DR: I probably have AIDS

upper body: http://i.imgur.com/2TxAP.jpg
back: http://i.imgur.com/41QbG.jpg

My equipment:

- das men's health muskelbuch (german)
- dumbbells (by ktec, total 25kg)
- yoga mat
- my motivation

I just want to share this because I want to show you people that you don't need an expensive gym-subscription (well in switzerland it's pretty expensive, don't know american standards) to get fit. I only spend around $100 and my stuff lasts a lifetime... I hope this will motivate the ones who are not able to afford a gym-membership.

and btw: I need the hipster glasses to see :P

have a nice day


MASSIVE EDIT: Holy sh/t... never thought this would get so many comments. I will post my workout here (was asked a few times). Don't be mad at me when I can't answer all of your comments. And have a heart, my first language is not english...


So things first off: 

- weight at start: ~64kg, weight by now: ~66kg | height stayed 174cm

- I know the lighting is not superb, but you can photoshop the contrast if you wanna have a different picture...

- I didn't take any supplements and I did not have a diet. I can eat whatever I want, I won't get too fat. I tried to watch it at the beginning but for me it's the hardest part of a daily routine. By now I keep on trying to eat natural proteins (which is in the meat and vegetables) after my workouts and not eating too many junk food (mcdonals, chips, cookies and that stuff).

- For those who call ""bullshit on this one"". Keep in mind that I didn't miss 1 single day of workout since 3 months. It was my only motivation because I don't have a girlfriend at the moment, my job is shitty and I have a hard time finding a new/better one.

- The bedroom is in my parents house and yes, it is asian oriented

- I'm an asthmatic. I did focus on my upper body simply because I wanted to see my first results there. I was a sprinter (athlete) in my youth and used to play floorball till this summer. So my legs were already pretty fit, even though I lost some muscle mass by now. My next goal is to get my legs in shape as they were before. I will post the progress the next time (atm there's nothing special to see about my legs).

- equipment I forgot to mention: pull up bar (in between door), tony horton ab ripper x video

And finally... a detailed workout plan (remember I'm not doing a diet, just this).

On mondays, wednesdays and fridays (pause as long as you wish between exercises but I recommend not longer than 3min):

- Number 1: alternate dumbbell curls (10 per hand) then 10 pushups -&gt; break of 1 minute between curls -&gt; repeat 5 times
- break
- Number 2: 10 sit-ups then 10 overhead triceps curls (don't know how to translate that one, sorry) -&gt; break of 1 minute between sit-ups -&gt; repeat 5 times
- break
- Number 1 once again
- break
- Number 3: Tony Horton P90x Ab Ripper X (forget to mention this on in equipment, sorry again) 15-20 reps (depends on how much time I want to spend on abs) 
- break
- Number 1 once again
- break
- Number 4: 10 chin ups with 10 pushups afterwards -&gt; break -&gt; repeat 5 - 10 times

equals: 150 bicep curls, 200+ ab exercises, 50 direct tricep exercises + the ones from pushups, 200+ pushups, 50-100 chin ups (they are the hardest).

time used: depends on breaks you take. I can do it fast in 45' or relaxed in 1h 15'

tuesdays and thursdays:

- 30 minutes running (outside)

- 30 minutes biking (outdoor in summer, on hometrainer in winter)

- Some pushups and chinups, even tought you should rest your muscles for 1 day

time used: ~1h

saturdays:

- free to choose of above exercises (I rarely do much at weekends)


EDIT 2: Thanks for all the nice words (mainly nice ;)) and it really makes me happy when I can motivate some of you to do the same. Just keep in mind that over the last few months this was really my only goal to achieve and I had plenty of time to spend. But as mentioned in the workout, you can do all the exercises in around 1h. And again, sorry if I can't answer all the questions. feel free to pm me when you really want a direct answer

EDIT 3: For those who wonder why the weight gain is so little. I can't really explain it either. I guess it's because I lost some of the lower body muscles.

The 35 lbs gain doesn't seem like much compared to many of you, but I guess I really just did it to slowly incorporate the working-out routine into my life. Now I work-out about 3 times a week, and I'm looking to further increase the amount of weight I can handle. If I want to bench say... 150 lbs by February, would that be feasible? Tips?


I do several exercises each session and I don't max out when I bench, my benching exercises generally go something like this:


3 x 5 warmup around 65 lbs

4 x 5 85-90% max

But the next day would look like this:


3 x 5 warmup, 65lbs

1 x 5 85-90% max + 5 lbs

3 x 5 85-90% max

Next:


3 x 5 warmup

2 x 5 85-90% max + 5 lbs

2 x 5 85-90% max


This keeps going until my last 4 sets are all at '85-95% max + 5 lbs.' Then I just rinse and repeat with +5 lb increments.


I think the funniest thing about today, was that I added an extra 20 lbs to my warmup sets without realizing... The entire time I was thinking: ""Wow, these feel heavier than usual, I must be really out of it today or I'm getting weaker...""


Just wanted to share this small success I accomplished today. Any feedback would be appreciated.

Edit:

Sorry was out for a bit...
I guess to answer the most popular question: 22 y/o asian male who excels at video games and reddit-ing for hours and hours and hours and... hours. I weigh a little over 150 lbs and stand around 6', so you can imagine that I'm probably pretty scrawny, haha.

Edit 2:

Wow, got a lot more feedback than I had initially expected. I read ALL of your responses.

First off, from the majority of your comments, the problem seems to be that I don't have a effective workout plan that I'm following. And that I'm clearly not pushing myself hard enough. NOTED. The other half all seem to agree that I just need to MAN UP. AGREED.

Secondly, I will look into all the programs you guys have suggested, but I'm leaning to the 5 x 5 or 3 x 5 with an additional 5 lbs each week.

Lastly, thank you all for your advice and constructive criticism. Although some of you are pretty harsh, I know you mean well for the bottom of your heart.

at the moment i don't have a gym membership. so everything is a little sporadic 

7 days a week.
 
wake up

handful of almonds, and a pre-workout shake. (n.o. xplode)

start workout when the shake kicks in. 

5 sets of each

normal pushups until fail. then drop to knee pushups until fail. x5

inbetween each set of pushups

situps with a 10lbs kettle plate until fail. then without until fail. x5 

so i rotate between push ups and sit ups until 5 sets of each are complete

i have this weird ab roller thing that i can put the kettle plates on. it can hold is about 50lbs 

i use that to do shrugs with until i feel my muscles about to explode. rotating to resistsance bands that i do curls with. x5

after that i  eat

3 chicken strips, almonds, yogurt, some sort of fruit/veggie, protein shake (cytogainer) with whole milk, and a bowl of ice cream.

after my food is all settled i will hop on my stationary bike until i can't go anymore.. 
i like going on walks on wooded trails which is about 5 miles, so i stop myself around mile 10 on the bike. 
in a day my walk/bike/cardio is 15-20 miles depending on how i feel.

i can eat the same thing for awhile without getting tired of it. so all of my meals are pretty much the same right now. but it works for me.

before i go to bed if i'm not too tired i will do pushups until i fail.

i take zma right before bed, and it the morning i feel like a new man. ready to go ham once again.

I always have 1 complete off day. The next 4.5 months were spent doing Keto with a weekly refeed(anything I want). Training remained the same with some jogging.  Standard split in the weight room with no squats and lightly deadlifting once every 3 weeks. These last 3 months have been insane(the good kind). I started a modified SL routine. Diet turned to TKD. I take in 25g carbs before workout and 50g after. I do cardio on the 3 off days in the morning. One is a 40 minute walk/slight jog. One is a 40 minute walk. And the other I run a nonstop 5k. Twice a week I warmup with a Prowler and sled session. On Thanksgiving I will switch to a standard diet again to see what the carbs can do for me. I will be eating at a very small deficit as Im happy at this weight. I just need to get the BF lower. I'm naturally a big guy and thats where I'm the most comfortable. Skinny fat is not for me. When I started I wore a size 50 pants. Now Im at a size 36. There was one area where I gained a couple inches. Lets just say my wife doesnt mind that one. She has also lost 50 pounds.

Diet is 1800 cals on non gym days and 2200 on gym days.

1351607519.0,446,self.Fitness,12c7ex,I started cutting 5 months ago and dropped from 170lbs to 155lbs. Why my abs are still not visible and my bf% remains high?,695,249,605,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/12c7ex/i_started_cutting_5_months_ago_and_dropped_from/,"22 years old, 5'11"",155lbs

3 years ago, I was at my heaviest (231lbs). I couldn't stand it anymore so I decided to change. I spent the first year focusing purely on my diet and I weighed around 185lbs. Then, I took up weight training and it helped me tremendously. My weight back then was hovering around 175lbs. I didn't count calories at all. I just kept my protein intake high, low carbs and fats. 

5 months ago, I decided to cut properly. I ate around 1500 to 1700cals per day, keeping a ratio of 5/3/2. I lost 15lbs since then but I still can't figure out why my bf% is still so high. I looked at most of the progress pictures here and most of the guys' bf% is around 14-15% with my height and weight. Is it genetics? I feel so demotivated. I feel like I'm doing something wrong here as if I'm shedding muscle rather than fat.

Now:

http://i.imgur.com/OJf16.jpg

EDIT:
Thanks for the input guys. It helps a lot. Now I finally know what's my problem. I didn't have much lean body mass to begin with when I lost my initial 50lbs without incorporating any weight lifting routine. Then, I ate at a deficit when I started to lift which further impeded my muscle growth process. Coupled with the fact that my deficit is extremely low, it made things worse. 

A lot of people recommended that I stop cutting and start bulking. I'll try to do it next month since I'm having my medical exam in weeks time. It's been 3 long years that I barred myself from eating excessively and I'm quite excited and afraid for this new regime. I want to see result but at the same time I'm quite apprehensive about the fat gain. When you lost that amount of fat in your liftetime, you really don't want to go back.

Bulking is new to me. My maintenance calorie from some websites is around ~2300-2500kcal. So in order to do a clean bulk, I should add in an extra 400-500kcal? What is the appropriate time to cut after the bulk? Add in another 20lbs? 30? What is the bf% that I expect to gain during the bulking process? Finally, how to divide the intake between carbs and fats intake? For protein, I usually maintain a daily intake of 180g or so.

EDIT2:
A lot of people do not believe my squats. This is the only picture I can find on my phone now with my legs bare. The person besides me also gyms but he seldom squats. It's not huge but comparison is there. I like squat because it helps you to lose weight. It's the first workout I did when I started weight lifting.

Recently, I did an experiment over the course of 3 weeks and gradually increased my calories to recomp-level (for my body), and my lifts/ energy level drastically began to improve. 

That said, with summer slowly creeping up, I'm not sure if I should continue with the recomp or stick with a cut. I'm worried if I continue to cut, my energy and strength will suffer for it; however, I'm also worried I'll just hit a plateau and remain there through summer (aesthetically speaking) if I recomp.

As some background, I follow Leangains/ intermitten fasting. I went from 1200 calories on rest days and 1500 on workout days to 1250 on rest and 1900 on workout days.

Also, I would be interested to hear any ideas or guesses as to what my bodyfat % is. At this point, I have no clue.

Mr. Rippetoe has a lot of valuable experience and knowledge about strength training. He also has misconceptions, biases, and is sometimes simply wrong. Don't forget his alpha assholery.

Just because he is wrong about one thing, or suffers from a personality defect, does not invalidate all the other things he says.

Likewise, just because he is right about a lot of things doesn't make everything he says gospel.

Use your fucking brain. Apply some judgment and think about what you want to get out of your training. Slurping on his balls every chance you get and being a hip anti-Rip are both stupid if they will interfere with your fitness goals. In either case, I doubt he gives a damn what you think anyways.

1348745527.0,440,self.Fitness,10k4a9,Examine updates: Melatonin,578,138,247,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/10k4a9/examine_updates_melatonin/,"Four updates this week, and the three minor ones are getting out of the way now:

- I forgot to mention [Bladderwrack](http://examine.com/supplements/Bladderwrack/) last week, its seaweed; doesn't boost metabolic rate, and it being a source of iodine in the past gave it misplaced hope of doing so
- [King Oyster](http://examine.com/supplements/King+Oyster/) is a mushroom with the weirdest bloody testosterone boosting study I have read, in elk and with obscene dosages (15-20% of food intake). Aside from the promise shown there that needs replication, its a mushroom
- [Hovenia Dulcis](http://examine.com/supplements/Hovenia+dulcis/) is an 'anti-alcohol' herb that appears to be able to reduce circulating blood alcohol levels in man when pre-loaded, but this pre-loading may also reduce the state of drink. This is something you slip your designated driver before drinking, but may curb the fun if taken all the time. Liver protective though

Anywho, on to the big one; [Melatonin](http://examine.com/supplements/Melatonin/) with some important tidbits out of the way first:

- I can find no evidence of negative feedback, it appears that usage of 3-5mg of melatonin for upwards of a month or two does not negatively affect the body's production of melatonin

- I can not find any evidence suggesting withdrawal or dependence on melatonin. Admittedly a *ton* of studies are done over the short term and with no follow-up, but there are a few very large interventions (200-700 persons) which suggest no dependence, withdrawal, and no tolerance for up to 6 months of usage of 2mg melatonin

- Toxicity threshold is hella high; there are human studies of 100mg (50-fold higher than normal dose) of melatonin being taken with no adverse effects (aside from sedation); based on this and the three above bullet points, as well as many studies using up to 10mg in children (6-12 years of age; *insomniac* children) I am preliminary concluding that melatonin is really bloody safe

- Melatonin is **not** a reliable agent for improving sleep **quality**. It **is** a reliable agent for decreasing sleep **latency**. It knocks you out, and this 'knocking out' *might* increase REM density and such but that is not 100%. This is why it is used clinically for treatment of insomniacs as sleep latency is the problem. Thus, if you fall asleep when your head hits the pillow I doubt melatonin would be of much benefit

- Melatonin's benefits appear to be half through melatonin itself (acting on 2-4 melatonin receptors) and the other part just benefits that are secondary to a proper circadian rhythm.

- Does not appear to significantly influence body composition (fat mass nor muscle mass), it *does* reliably increase growth hormone, but it would probably be a bad idea to take it pre-workout since this is a sedative and lowers body temperature.

- Significantly intertwined with leptin signalling, can increase circulating leptin levels, I have no clue the practical significance of this. Perhaps a link between why better sleep can aid fat loss?

- May help tinnitus slightly but significantly; that's bloody awesome

- This thing is found in foods, damn near all plants and is high in beer and wine

Then other random updates:

For those of you who frequent Examine a fair bit, we do have the [stacks](http://examine.com/stacks/) page (accessible by the top menu). We have added both [eye](http://examine.com/stacks/ocular-eye-health.html) and [ear](http://examine.com/stacks/hearing-and-ear-health.html) mainly because they are quite rare to get nutraceuticals to benefit them, and we have an [anti-aging](http://examine.com/stacks/anti-aging.html) one that comes with a whole list of pre-cautions since no nutraceutical is highly reliable in improving lifespan.

THANK YOU FOR CELEBRATING WITH ME. LETS KEEP PUMPIN![/EDIT]



A post I've been so eager to make is finally here. I used to think growing up that I was ""big built"". As you can see, what bullshit. If anything, a medium frame best describes me now. 

But this is the single most eventful day of my life - the day I long dreamed about for years and years. Today this is it - and today I am celebrating (with a glass of water!)

First and foremost, the before/after:
==&gt; http://imgur.com/xiZ81.jpg

It contains all the details.

The day before I started my diet, I wrote this down in Notepad. These are the reasons why I made the change:
Big Stomach Gut

Back Pains from bending down

Psoriasis Worsening

Look unattractive

Cannot wear clothes I like

Stretchmarks all over my body

Chest pains breathing time to time

Wheezing to get deep breaths in after eating

Scared of Diabetes

Growing depression

No confidence in myself

Fear of dying early



How did I do it? Really simple. I just ate differently.
You are what you eat. I used to hear that so much - and I used
to hate that so much at the same time.

To explain the diet bluntly:
- Fruits
- Lean Meats
- Veggies
- Caloric Restriction
- No refined/processed crap. No carbs. No starch. No soda, etc.

Pretty simple. Nothing to it. Not sure why people make it more complicated than it needs to be.

Calorie cycling also helped to overcome any ""plateaus"".


But now here I am - younger, revitalized, energetic, ready to take
on more of the world at 24 (and hopefully my body hasn't taken a toll on my lifespan as a result of the obesity...)

What's next? I'm maintaining. As you can tell, I still have fat. It's
on purpose. I need some mass to work with - I haven't done ANY
weight training. I need to start. ASAP. 

Now it's time for me to plan my next attack: Getting ripped.

I hope this inspires you all. Please don't hesitate to comment. 

I'm going to the laser clinic right now for an appointment - to
see what they can do about my stretchmarks. :)

GROSS: But are there actual exercises besides running that you've stopped doing because of the research that you've read?

REYNOLDS: Not really. What I have started doing are exercises that I actually thought were unhealthy and turned out not to be. I do squats, which look very ungainly **but I've had several scientists tell me that if they can only do one exercise on any given day, they will do squats because squats, they burn calories, they build the muscles in your legs and your bottom.**

They make you stronger. It's also the squat is essentially an exercise that can guarantee that you will be independent all through your lifespan, because one of the things that happens as people get older is you lose muscle mass, you lose strength, and you become unable to get up out of your chair. If you're doing squats, you will always be able to stand up.

So I now do 20 squats at least a few times a week. I don't use weights. You don't have to hold a dumbbell. Just squat down, stand up, and do it again. I also do...

GROSS: So when you say squats you mean like deep knee bends? Same?

REYNOLDS: Yes, exactly.

GROSS: Yeah. Mm-hmm.

REYNOLDS: And if that's hard...

GROSS: I had heard those are really bad for your knees, right? Didn't they say that?

REYNOLDS: And they're not.

GROSS: They're not. OK.

REYNOLDS: In fact, it appears pretty clearly that if you do it correctly it's good for your knees because it builds the muscles and the tendons all around your knee. It makes it more stable. So in fact, doing squats appears to be a very good thing for your knees. Do it carefully. If it hurts, don't go all the way down until your thighs are parallel to the ground.

Maybe keep your thighs at a 60 degree angle to the ground, but it should, for someone who has healthy knees, it should make your knees stronger. You can also, if you find a regular squat really difficult, do what are called wall squats, meaning you lean against the wall and go up and down. Then when that's easy, move away from the wall, do 20.

That one thing you're not doing that will finally let you lose body fat and gain muscle. You've tweaked diets, tweaked routines, supplements, rest periods, HIIT, LISS, crossfit, insanity, P90x, what are you missing?


*Consistency*


If you're the person who can't stop tweaking and making routines and diets ""Better"" because you aren't getting results, there's a pretty big possibility it's because you can't stop changing things. Stop over thinking it. Just do your damn routine. Just eat your food. While I personally don't like Mark Rippetoe's routines for my body, I like his attitude. I think the biggest thing to get from Mark and his books and interviews is to just ""Shut up and lift"". Too many regular people and skinny guys screw up perfectly good training because they can't stop reading articles, buying new supplements, modifying routines, switching said routines after 1-2 months, and looking for that ""missing link"" in their training.


2 minute rest periods or 3? 3 set of 8, maybe 2 of 10? Do i front squat, box squat, hack squat, full squat? 4 days a week. No, 3. Wait, 4. Upper/Lower Upper/Lower. No, Lower first. 45 minutes cardio. No, 30 with an incline. 5g creatine. 10g is better. 30 or 40 grams of whey? 1 gram of fish oil. Nah 3 is good. 5 might be better.


Just stop tweaking. Do your routine as laid out and milk it for as long as possible. Did you stall in a few lifts? Take a week off, reset those lifts, try it again. No need to throw out an entire routine just because your bench stalled for a few weeks. There are small things you can do to help progress, but don't radically change your routine the first sign of your progress slowing down. Sometimes you have bad days, bad weeks. Stress, sleep, food intake, etc. Can't move your box squat? Regular squat for a while. But don't go from a 3x5 box squat with 3 minute rests to a 4x10 narrow squat super setted with leg presses.


Have you ever met this guy? You know, the 150lb'er doing Starting Strength? ""I added leg presses on the weekend, 2 more bench sets, a bicep/triceps day, and a set onto each squat and dead."" Well then, you aren't really doing starting strength anymore, are you? And how do you know more than the people who train lifters for a career? Don't blame your failures on a routine or diet you hacked all to shit.


Here are a few articles from the late IA.


http://www.ironaddicts.com/forums/showthread.php?t=19780&amp;
We have tons of very solid routines posted here. Seems every time we get new members the first thing out of their keyboards are something like ""looks great, but can I do powercleans instead of deadlifts"" or can I substitute lift B for lift A.


The answer is you can do whatever you want, quit f'ing asking, but if you change up key aspects of a routine that is designed for a purpose and has key lifts in place for a reason You are not doing the damn routine anymore, you are doing your bastardized version of it.


Do whatever you want, quit asking if you can change everything, if you can make it better you likely don't need anyone to provide a routine in the first place.


I am not stating that no lift substitutions can or should be done. Doing something like subbing incline bench for bench press, a cable row for a barbell row, or a dumbbell curl for a barbell curl can be fine, but if you do not have the training knowledge or common sense to figure this out yourself, you should just be doing the routine as written.

I receive tons of emails and PM’s, and questions from training clients who’s head is swimming in a sea facts and fiction regarding the how and why’s of weight training and nutrition. One thing that sticks out is a LOT of these guys are extremely concerned about the 5% stuff. And by that, I mean the details that all put together and put into active use will account for 5% or less of the actual results. Now that would be all well and fine if they were actually someone that is in need of that last 5%, but more often than not, these are guys that are beginners, or low intermediate level lifters that are so far away from even having a remote handle on their diet, training and rest that it is ridiculous to even think about this stuff. But think they do. Often to the point of so much focus on the little stuff, that the big picture items are totally lost in the background with perhaps the thought that it’s these little details that are holding them back instead of their faulty training and horrendous diet. Is this you?




**Edit** - I like the constructive criticism, because I enjoy reading about people who have had a different experience than I. I just want to make it clear, without having to respond to several posts with the same message, that I actually encourage people to experiment and have fun with their routines and diets, but not at the cost of their goals and spinning their wheels.

Alrighty. In this post I am going to summarize my complete journey from a skinny “Do you even lift?” kid to where I am today. I’ll tell you how I got there and share all I have learned along the way
	.
I first got interested in building some muscle when I was about 17. I worked out with a bench in my basement and got **some** results, but nothing near what I wanted. Throughout this period I was obsessed with having a six-pack, so I was not eating enough. I did not track calories, protein, or anything. I didn’t look so great. Here’s some pics from that time period, spring of my senior year of high school:

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/aPKYM) body weight: about 150 lb

I’m the blonde kid. Yeah, not a lot of good size there. At this time my routine solely consisted of dicking around with dumbbells. Diet was just stupid like I said. Everyone here says you need to eat to gain, clearly I had not yet learned that lesson.

Flash forward a few months and I get to college, I now have access to a full weightroom, but like an asshole I only use the dumbbells and machines because I’m too chickenshit to be bothered with anything else. However I was very dedicated, I hit the gym every day and gave it 100%. Sadly that didn’t matter because my routine sucked and my diet was the same as before, I was obsessed with having abs so I severly limit my intake. No tracking of protein or any other macronutrients. Here’s where this got me after about six months:

[Album]( http://imgur.com/a/GZINe) Body weight was about 150 lb

As you can see I had some abdominal definition, but who cares? I was still a twig and I wanted to be big and ripped. At this point I stopped lifting for about two years, mostly due to class, girlfriend, undergraduate research completely taking over my life. I was no longer limiting my food intake however, and was eating whatever I wanted with a healthy appetite. 

After my time off, I looked like [this](http://imgur.com/oQh9lWI). Bigger yes, but not in the way I wanted, I was flabby and out of shape. I weighed about 185 lb. Not huge for 6'2''.

I decided one day that it was time to change, and I was going to get ripped or die ‘mirin. Here is where things started to go right for me.  I actually did a little research and found that protein is important for building muscle, so that’s what I started eating; meat and lots of it. I’m eating lots of protein, pretty much all the meat I want, and not a lot of carbs. Maybe a half cup of oatmeal a day. I don’t have any progress pics from the start of this period, I wish I did, it would be interesting to see. 

I found r/fitness (the best thing that ever happened to me fitness wise) and took in  and applied the new information. I started doing squats (albeit not to parallel), bench with a barbell, and some deadlifts. Everything else I just used dumbbells for, but I always gave it my all in the weightroom. For every exercise I would do 5 sets of 10 reps, hitting every body part. I split my workout into a shoulder/legs day; bicep/back day; and tricep chest/day. I also did HIIT cardio (sprinting) because I thought it would magically give me abs. After about six months of that I got to here:

[Spring 2008](http://imgur.com/a/8eTvE) Body weight about 190 lb

Well, I was certaintly getting somewhere, but I wanted more. I decided to go full on “squats n’ oats”. I deloaded my squat and started going past parallel. I did not literally do SS or any beginner program. However my primary goal was to maximize my strength on squat, bench, deadlift, ohp, and power clean, which is the essence behind SS and SL. What I did was essentially do two compound barbell movements every workout. For example I’d have a squat/ohp day; deadlift/power clean; and a bench/squat day. My routine might have looked something like this:

Day A: Squat 5 X 5; OHP 5X5; Dumbbell shoulder press 5 X 10; pull ups 5  X AMRAP(As Many Reps As Possible)

Day B: deadlift 5 X 5; power clean 5 X 5; dumbbell bicep curl 5 X 10; chin ups 5 X AMRAP; dumbbell rows 1 X AMRAP

Day C: Squat 5 X 5; barbell bench press 5 X 5; dumbbell bench press 5 X 5; pull ups 5 X AMRAP

Then take a rest day, rinse, repeat.

During this period I was eating, but not enough. I actually counted calories and protein for the first time in my life, and I would hit 2600 kCal with 200 g of protein every single day. At the beginning of this training phase my numbers were: squat 200 X 1; deadlift 315 X 1; OHP 115 X 1; bench 200 X 1. Here’s where that got me to after about six months in terms of physique:

[Fall 2011](http://imgur.com/a/nQBLC#0) body weight about 200 lb

Yep, I got a lot bigger, pretty solid gains. Notice the back got much bigger, also notice I was doing pull ups/chin ups every workout. I think that was a smart move on my part. But I was still just getting started. Here I am a few months later after doing a little bulk and a cut

[Spring 2012](http://imgur.com/a/cYHZc#0) weigh about 190 lb in these pics

I cut a little more after this point, and realized I wanted more size still. So I began what was essentially a year of pure bulking and powerlifting training. Every day I would eat a minimum of 3000 kCal, most days I would eat even more. I didn;’t even track (a mistake looking back), but I would guess 3600 kCal. I Always I hit at least 1g of protein per pound of body weight. My training switched over to 5/3/1. As per 5/3/1 instructions, I tested my 1RM on all my lifts, they were: Squat 330; Deadlift 405; Bench 270; and OHP 160. 

So I kept up with 531 and eating like a horse for a long time. I broke up the bench press progression with some cycles of smolov jr. After about 6 months my 1RM’s were: Squat 375lb; Deadlift 450 lb; Bench 300 lb; and OHP 175 lb. Cool. So I kept on trucking with that. I stepped up the intensity of my workouts, increased calories, and a few months later I could squat 375 X 2 X 2; deadlift 500 X 1, 440 X 6, and 405 X 10; OHP 190 X 1; bench didn’t move much. Here’s how I looked after all of that:

[Fall 2012](http://imgur.com/a/SEJza#0) weighed 220 lb at this time

In about a year I had gotten bigger and a shit ton stronger. I also realized I fucking sucked at powerlifting. My numbers were garbage from some one who weighed 220 lb and I was getting sick of low rep sets. So I decided to cut and focus on hypertrophy training. Time to see what muscle I had built under this fat. I scaled back the calories to 2300 kCal/day and started doing PHAT. This has taken me to where I am right now, pictured in the album below

[A few weeks ago](http://imgur.com/a/BJDWj#0) body weight is around 195 to 205 depending on how much water im holding and if I need to take a dumper.

I’m very happy with how I look today. I've surpassed what I've ever though was possible, but I still want more! I’m going to keep on getting bigger and leaner and see what I’m capable of.

**TL;DR** I went from [this](http://imgur.com/fWbNaIf) to [this](http://imgur.com/7n6Szts)

In the comments section I'll highlight what I think are the most important principles of packing on size and what I've learned along the way.

I thought I would share my fitness journey from the ages of 18 to where I am now (23).

Throughout my whole teenage years I was pretty significantly overweight. It was pretty tough going through puberty - I always had loads of friends and was pretty happy but I had no success with the ladies.

I got to about 18 and pretty much all my friends we doing stuff with their girlfriends and I was sitting at home with my greasy long hair playing WoW, eating pizza and feeling sorry for myself. Something had to change. This is me around that point;

[Me age 18](http://imgur.com/a/HnWSR)

I think I was around 16 or 17 stone (~100kg / 220lbs) of pure fat here.

I started with mostly cardio. I went running every day and started eating healthy. I lost a massive amount of weight pretty quickly and by the time I was 19 and heading to Uni I was pretty skinny. I stayed pretty skinny for a few years until I got into weightlifting.

I've been training for just over a year and I've seen some impressive changes. I've actually just started bulking to add some mass to my frame (I'll let you know how it goes). I still eat clean and drink loads of water while lifting 3 x week.

Here is me now;

[Me age 23](http://imgur.com/a/SFY3F)

I'm 6'3"" and about 87kg currently. Safe to say, I'm much MUCH happier now. I've started this journey of self improvement and I don't think I'm going to stop anytime soon. I'm going to continue lifting and eating as best I can.

I can go into more detail about my program and diet if there is any interest.

Thanks for reading!

**EDIT:** Wow, you guys are awesome, thanks for the kind words!

For those interested, here is my current routine and diet for bulking. Cutting diet is pretty much the same but just less of everything.

Squat

Overhead Press

Dips

I started working out in November 2011. About 3 months later I noticed a sharp pain in my left knee when I squatted and when I walked up and down stairs. I figured it was just a symptom of my not great noob form. so I fixed my form and it never went away. Not even after months of good form. 

I finally went to the doc and the X-rays showed that I have a [Bone Spur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteophyte) AKA osteophyte. Apparently I developed it early on during a growth spurt when I was 12 or 13. The doc asked me if I had started working out recently. When I told him I had he explained that the reason I am just now experiencing the pain was because my muscle had finally grown so big that it getting aggravated by the spur. It will take a quick out patient procedure to grind the spur down and I'll be back to normal in no time.

Just thought it was awesome that I was getting so big I was hurting myself.

Carb is much easier and faster to burn, but you only can store a certain amount. Fats... there's always a lot. But your body prefers to burn carbs... it's easier. 

you need to train long and steady enough that you finish your carb reserves and start burning fat... and don't BONK when carbs are finished.

I make this all the time:

**Beef &amp; Broccoli bowl**

* ~250g of round steak, cubed

* 1tbl canola oil

* ~1.5cups of chopped broccoli

* ~2tbl A1 sauce + a bit of Worcestershire

* 1 clove of garlic

* Small handful of cheese curd (garlic is best)

Cube up the meat, chop up some garlic.  Start the broccoli to steaming.  Heat up a non-stick pan with oil and fry the meat really quick then turn down the heat.  Toss in the garlic, Worcestershire, and A1.  Keep it warm until the broccoli is done then throw the curds into the pan so they warm up.  Dump it all onto a dish, grind some pepper on there and enjoy.  

 
* ~750cal, 23g Carbs, 82g Protein, 36g Fat (half is from the cooking oil).

Total cost: about $4.50.  Takes 10-15 mins from prep to eating.  Tastes pretty damned good actually.  I grab a forkful of broccoli and stab into some meat and cheese and enjoy.  Looks kind of nasty I guess.

I read the FAQs and started calculating my daily protein intake. I weigh 160lbs and I am only consuming about 80-90g of protein/day while I would ideally like to be in the 115-130g range. 


Then I read up on Whey and I am thinking of using it to supplement my protein intake. I vaguely remember a redditor did some sort of experiment to see which of the major brands actually contained the amount of protein that they claimed. Does anyone have a link to that study/data? 


Additionally, I am guessing the best place to buy would be Amazon or Bodybuilding.com. But I have never tasted these supplements before and I am hesitant to buy a 5lb tub.  Will a local GNC store have small packets so that I can try it out before dropping $50 on a tub?  

Thanks!

They have an excellent return policy: you can return opened/unopened products within 30 days. Their pricing was similar to Amazon.

Odyssey House is an east harlem rehab clinic. Obesity is a huge problem in poorer parts of NYC and health is at its worst in these areas (i think east harlem qualifies as a food desert). So along with all their other issues, they were mostly overweight. But these people were laughing and playful as they ran, and it was just so good to see.

Rehab centers often get left with the responsibility of treating mental health as well as getting people off drugs and back into society. There are very few mental health services for the poor and this is something I care deeply about. Running is a central part of my own mental health treatment and so this activity just seemed to be so good for them. 

They also got a chance to be around others in a really positive, healthy atmosphere, because the park is full of people exercising in the mornings.

(They used a portion of the spreadsheet, and said their current cost is ""X"".  And one of the companies on the spreadsheet does private labeling (and sells their brand on bb.com) and the other sells a lot of product on their online site).  They re-emphasized that their own margins are around 12% and if you find better deals , than you should be skeptical of the quality of their product.  

They again mentioned that an honest company willl come in between the 90 - 95% because of the way the protein percentages are calculated.  

So from a standpoint, physicistjedi's email has shaken the protein manufacturers/producers!  It has gone viral among that part of the supplement/nutrition community.  This is a good thing.  The bad part, is this might have inherently set a price floor at which a manufacturer/producer will sell their product because now they'll keep their price levels at a certain minimum to keep customers from doubting the quality of their product (w/o independent testing results).

Just wanted to post this to motivate anyone I can. Left is before, right pic is after and is still a huge work in progress. For years all I did was make excuses and act extremely lazy when it came to my health. I told myself ""tomorrow I'll start, tomorrow I'll start..."" and never did. One day a couple months ago I decided I needed to stop making excuses for myself and just go for it, and I did. If you're overweight, underweight, or generally not happy with yourself STOP MAKING EXCUSES; you can do anything you put your mind to! Motivate yourself and just do it, stop telling yourself you will do it tomorrow, and just start today. One thing I have learned over the past couple months is that how ever much you put into it, is how much you will get out of it; and this goes for ANYTHING in life. So get out there, get motivated and kick some ass. Put 110% into everything you do and you will get 110% back. YOU CAN DO IT, BELIEVE IN YOURSELF!

I curl around 100lbs (up from about 60lbs), I curl 40lbs when I use dumbbells and max at 45lbs (up from using 15-20lbs). I use 40-45lb dumbbells for shoulder press (up from 20 lbs). I push around 130 on upright rows (up from about 60-70lbs).

-I would like to clarify that I was not going for mass or a ""huge"" look, I drink mass gainer shakes because I have an extremely high metabolism. Couple that with the amount that I workout and I would lose weight if I didn't. My sole purpose for getting my ass in the gym was just that: getting my ass in the gym. I wanted to get in shape, I wanted to shape and sculpt my body. I wanted to be lean and cut. However, since I have begun plateauing I will be changing my regiment soon to be doing more squats, deadlifts, and heavier lifting to break the plateau. 

-Mostly I do alot of dumbbell exercises and natural body lifting like all different types of pushups, dips, elevated pushups, oh and I rock climb (not religiously though).


TL;DR EDIT: I wasn't trying to get huge, I was trying to get my skinny ass in shape; which I did. I use alot of dumbbells, the small amount of equipment I have access too, dips and pushups, etc. I have plateaued and will be lifting heavier to break it.

I thought they were going to complain about the noise I was making when I was deloading, but what they said was surprising, but not unexpected.  

They told me my form sucked and I was arching my back hard. A typical reaction might've been getting defensive, but they approached me in such a non-confrontational and concerned way that there was nothing I could do but agree.

I completely saw where they were coming from and they were absolutely right, my old 1RM and 5RM were 315 and 305 so I've been trying to bridge the gap.  I was working my way up slowly at first, from 185, adding 10lbs per week up till 225.  Then I wanted to speed things up and jumped to 275 this week.

So after their talk, I ended up starting from the bottom up after my set, and worked my way up, trying to see where my form was going to shit, 135 looked and felt okay, 185 looked good and 225 okay.  I ended up thanking them again after I left and coming back to the realization, (obviously) **form is everything**.  

So it looks like I'm gonna be working my way back up from 225 again, making sure my form is 100% this time around.  It sucks, but they were right, and in reality they were looking out for me.

TL; DR: Swallow your pride and work your way up slowly again if you fall off the wagon.  Don't push shit and risk injury.  If someone approaches you, don't automatically get defensive and hear em out.  Conversely, if you see someone doing something completely wrong, let em know, you could be saving them a lot of future pain.

Most of my life I was always north of the acceptable BMI. Pudgy and soft, but not obesely. During my rotund years I'd always been a jovial fellow and could more or less instantly fit into whatever group I was hanging out with or with any new job or environment.

Just the light hearted jokester who wasn't quite wild-Hawaiian-shirt stereotype. Just easy going and people just seemed to get along with me, mainly because I didn't take myself too seriously. Couple with my physical appearance people just let their guard down around me. Guys instantly joked with me. That my jokes tend to be light hearted self-deprecation helped. Girls instantly went the teddy bear route. It was like I was the gay friend, minus the gay part.

Then I lost 40 lbs, started focusing on strength and general fitness and just got bigger, though lighter (on the scale). 

With family and old friends it's the same as usual, usually a lot of jokes about my fat old self. But month by month I realized a general change in atmosphere when I'm out and about.

With new acquaintances, parties with people I'm just meeting, social environments, stuff like that, I still act like I always do but people seem to get taken aback when I make fun of myself.

When I say something a bit off the cuff, it's no longer, ""Oh, that's pretty cute coming from the fat Asian kid,"" and more ""Woah, didn't expect that from you.""

Of all the joke problems that come along with getting more fit (clothes being too big/small, etc), people actually taking me more seriously than I'd like wasn't even on my mind. I get this could be viewed as a positive. I finally look as mature as the age on my driver's license would indicate. But it's really not who I am. I don't like to look intimidating, or however people currently see me. I don't think I have a perpetual asshole face. It's the same as always. Eventually people realize I'm all jokes, but the initial ice breaker is a lot harder than it used to be.

FAST.,560,146,353,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/sar1z/ive_recently_gotten_rid_of_a_tapeworm_gestating/,"I started off going to the gym about 14 months ago. Just started getting in to it, learning all the ups and downs about what sets to do for what, names of the muscles, what supplements to take, all that jazz. (I still don't know much, to be honest. It's very confusing for me.)

Fast forward a few months, I wasn't progressing anywhere, and I was actually LOSING weight, despite training 4 times a week, protein shakes as every snack and bulking up on the right foods. I wasn't feeling any better, I was feeling worse. I was steadily becoming more lethargic, tired, and nauseated. At first I thought it was just my new promotion at work that was stressing me out, all the extra pressure riding on my shoulders dragging me down. Also included could be the pressure from my girlfriend (at the time) to see her more and more and keep up with her.... Wouldn't say demands, but more like authoritative requests.
This continued for some time, no matter how much I would push myself at the gym, no matter how much I was eating, I wasn't gaining anything. I went to the doctor about it, and I had tests run for Diabetes, Cancer, HIV, others I can't even remember. Zero results given.


Forward about 6 months again (9 months from approximate contraction of tapeworm), I had dropped 30kgs in a single month. I went from 88kg to 58kg, without going to the gym at this point. I was still pushing myself at work and for my girlfriend, but I barely had the energy for that, even. As a result, we fought more and more, until I eventually couldn't bear to see her cry and be disappointed with my pitiful efforts anymore, and ended things with her. 

I went to ER wondering what the fuck was going on with my health, and finally someone said they may have an idea. They took scans of my lower intestines, and discovered the problem. A tapeworm, estimated to be 6 metres long (I think that's 18ft) and nine months old. It's been removed now, and we're about 4 months down the track from this all happening. I'm still single (my supposed ""love of my life"" had found another man within 3 weeks, AN OLD FRIEND EVEN) and I am looking like all hell. I want to get back out there, feeling healthy, confident and happy with myself again. I need help on the best way to progress from this experience I've had, like what good nutrients/supplements I can take to restore my weight and immune system back to full health, the sets I should be looking at for fast improvement. (For the record, these past four months I have been doing close to nothing and eating bad food due to lack of motivation).


TL;DR: A male man has gone through 9 months of pregnancy with a tapeworm, and needs to get his shit back together now that it's gone. Fast results would be good.

**EDIT:** Cheers for all the feedback and help guys, really appreciate the help you've given me.

First I just wanted to say thanks for everybody here for great advice and support.

I used to workout in high school and a few years in my twenties but really let things go in my thirties. After waking up on my fortieth birthday in the winter (2012) with a sharp back pain, I decided to get back in shape.

My height is 5'7""

I don't know my weight in the Spring and Summer photos because I just didn't care then. My weight now is around 150 lbs, but I don't really care about my weight. I just care about how I feel if that makes sense.

Food: My take on food is very colorful fresh vegetables (kale, carrot, red cabbage, holland peppers, swiss chard, scallions, wild mushrooms), lean meats (steak, pork, chicken breasts), organic free range eggs, and complex carbs (wild rice or brown rice mixed with beans). For snacks I drink a cup of whole milk kefir, an organic banana, a cup of organic tomato juice and a mixed nut health bar. Plenty of water through out the day and one or two cups of coffee.

Supplements: None. My stomach is sensitive and I don't trust ingesting anything packaged or processed even if it's a vitamin. I try to get everything from my meals and snacks.

Before my workout I walk fast on the treadmill for six minutes. Then I stretch and also do some dynamic stretches.

Because of a high school wrestling shoulder problem, I avoid many barbell lifts as well as doing rotator cuff exercises twice a week.

I don't really keep track of my reps or weight. I just go by feel and try to go hard as I can on every set and workout. Sorry I'm not more specific.

Workout: Basic Four Day Split

Mon: Back / Bi's / Forearms -- Pull ups 4 sets, Deadlifts 2 sets, T bar Row 4 sets, Lat Pull down 4 sets, Kroc row 3 sets, Palm in close grip lat pull downs 3 sets, Barbell Curls 3 sets, Hammer Curls 3 sets, Seated dumbbell curls, then 12 sets of three different forearm exercises.

Tues: Shoulders / Traps / Abs -- Dumbbell OHP 5 sets, Dumbbell Side Raises 3 sets, Face Pulls 4 Sets, Dumbbell Bent Over Rear Raise 3 Sets, Dumbbell Shrugs, Crunches 4 Sets, Cable Crunches 4 sets. If I have energy I'll add two or three calf exercises.

Thurs: Legs -- Squats 5 sets, Romanian Deadlifts 4 sets, Lunges 3 sets, Leg Extensions 3 sets, Leg Press 3 sets, Three calf exercises for 12 sets.

Fri: Chest / Tris -- Incline Dumbbell Press 5 sets, Flat Dumbbell Press 4 sets, Cable Crossovers 4 sets, Machine Flyes 3 sets, Machine Press 3 sets, Skull Crushers 4 sets, Pull Down Extensions 4 sets.

My goal right now is to bulk and start cutting in the Spring.

All feedback is welcome and thanks again for a great community.

Edit: I wanted to say the best thing about getting in shape is that I started dating my gf when I was a slob and now she says she would have never guessed that this is how I would turn out and that she got a great deal. Whenever she sees me with my shirt off she says, ""That's mine.""

Also, my face looks so much better. I think that's probably been the greatest change. I looked haggard and bloated before. Now I look healthy and almost glowing. Friends always comment how much better I look and I know they're commenting on my face since it's cold and I'm always wearing a heavy jacket and sweater. I used to feel like crap looking in the mirror but I just got my first smartphone recently and enjoy taking pictures with my gf now.

I didn't take a before picture because I really didn't plan on dieting it slowly just transformed into a diet. That is me at roughly 275lbs, at the beginning of this year I would say I was 285-290lbs.


I spent Jan-April working on a diet and got down to 235lbs on May 1st, this is when I decided to start working and, here is the before:

I spent the next few months lifting and continuing to work on getting my diet correct.  August I cancelled my gym membership due to money problems and started running a lot, doing ab routines, pull ups, and push ups.
This is me as of today 10/12/12 ~193lbs:

http://i.imgur.com/EXX22.jpg


Still got a few more pounds to go to get rid of the rest of my belly, should be there by the end of the year no problem.  Training for a half marathon now so my muscle mass has went to shit, once I have completed it I am going to get on a bulking routine.


**If you want my advice here it is, otherwise just ignore and continue life**

Take it slow, the way I look at it is so many of use grow up with a very skewed idea of what a diet should be and you cant change this overnight, or even in a month.  Too many of use get in the mindset of eating fast food, drinking soda, etc is the default and when you decide to start eating vegetables, fruit, and chicken/fish it is a ""diet."" Really you should think of eating healthy food as humans default setting and eating junk food as something outside of the norm.  For me it took a very long time of slowly weening myself off of junk, I am currently on a very efficient diet of Kashi cereal breakfast, banana snack, chicken salad lunch, celery/carrots snack, depending on what I decide to do after work I have cereal or a salad.  If I am playing hockey or going for a long running I have some cereal so I have the energy for it, otherwise I have a salad.  I go by that diet everyday and have no desire to eat anything else, when I think about soda or tacobell I think about how inefficient the energy is and how weird it would be to down that many pointless calories. By no means did this happen overnight it took roughly 7 months to get myself to this point, but now I feel like my body is running better then it ever has before.

 Biceps day-&gt;rest day-&gt;shoulder+chest-&gt;rest-&gt;triceps + abs-&gt;rest-&gt;upper+ lower back-&gt;rest-&gt;repeat.
 I'm still a newbie in lifting and have a lot to learn.I just wanted to share my small success and maybe motivate people to follow their goals :).

Every workout i either increased the weights or increased the reps per set by a little bit.(about 10% for weights and 3-4 for reps).

People get shot down around here for not approaching their goals the ""best"" way, the hardest and fastest way. People get told that light exercises ""do nothing"", that only doing a few reps/light weights/walking/etc. ""does nothing.""

Only doing nothing does nothing.

For the last six months, I've been doing yoga, pilates, and jogging. No major changes to my diet. When I posted my goals and plan six months ago, I got so many ""CrossFit/deadlifts/Beachbody or GTFO"" and ""exercise doesn't do shit without dieting"" messages that I deleted the post. People said whatever muscle I did build would just be on top of my fat, and I'd look terrible.

I have achieved all my goals. I lost ten pounds, have a six pack, and have biceps I want to show to strangers. If I'd listened to you guys, I would probably have spent a lot money, tried a really hard routine and diet for a week, and then given up.

I could barely bench more than the bar, and I was curling 20's like a stud.
After a couple years in college, I knew it was time to make a change, but I fell into the same trap as most college students do. After a year of horrible eating habits, too much drinking, and doing machine chest and curls, I arrived at this about March 2011.

About 125ish lbs, weak legs and weak lifts. I even injured my rotator cuff through poorly executed benching. I wish I could take back this whole year, I would have progressed so much more.
Starting summer of last year, I started doing a lot of research with my buddy and finally started a plan with a real firm grasp on training and dieting correctly. It wasn't the best progress because I still neglected doing compound movements (Deadlifts,Squats) and went with machine legs instead (Another stupid ass move), but atleast it was better than the utter crap I was doing before. Although my diet was better, I drank way too much and too often and ended up bigger but also fatter. It was a pretty bad beer gut (I was too ashamed to take pictures lmao)
I started my final try at doing things right around early part of this year. I cut out most of the drinking, and I started a really good paleo diet. I was able to completely get rid of my beer belly and cut down to 11% BF or so I think.

My 3RM at the beginning of this year:
Barbell Row : 125

Dumbell Press: 70

Pullup: BW + 45

Deadlift: 185

Squat: 135 (Fuakkk LOL)

OHP: 45 lb Dumbells 



My 3RM as of today:
Barbell Row : 165

Dumbell Press: 90

Pullup: BW + 65

Deadlift: 285 (last week). 295 today!

Squat: 215 (last week), 225 today!

OHP: 65 lb Dumbells

I basically ran Layne Norton's PHAT this summer, and ate a mostly paleo diet. I went from 143ish, at 14-15% BF ( I think), to 135 now (11% BF? ). I kept the drinking down to a minimum, about once or twice a month, and that's what I think really helped me lose that BF%. It sucks that shitty bench technique has significantly screwed up my shoulder progress, but stretching and warming up is really helping me come back. I hope to increase my puny leg strength even more, now that I've gotten over being scared to squat/DL, and help my shoulders catch up on all the growth they've missed (My rear delts are MIA!...)

For all you people out here on this community giving out free advice and helping each other out, thank you so much. Honestly, the things I've learned here have really helped me improve myself. That's all I gotta say, but I'm down to answer any questions anyone has! (Whether it be about the mistakes I made, or the good decisions I made :) )

In nearly every conversation about intermittent fasting (IF) someone explains it as ""you don't eat for 16 hours and then you eat all your calories in the remaining eight.""

That is but one kind of IF plan.  There are many more.  

""[Intermittent fasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting)"" is a generic term that simply means you have planned periods where you voluntarily go without eating.  That's it.  If you're talking about eating, you're not talking about fasting.  

IF is, however, a component and cornerstone of many dietary protocols.  Here are some examples of the more popular ones:

* **[Leangains](http://www.leangains.com)** - 16-hour fast everyday, all caloric intake ingested in the following eight.  Macronutrients and calories are cycled every other feeding window (high carb/low fat/surplus on lifting days; high fat/low carb/deficit on non-lifting days)

* **[Eat.Stop.Eat.](http://www.eatstopeat.com/)** - One or two 24-hour fasts per week.  No making up for lost time in constrained feeding windows.  

* **[The Warrior Diet](http://www.warriordiet.com/)** - Daily 20-hour fasts, with all your daily caloric and nutrient needs ingested in the remaining 4 hours.  It does allow for small, simple snacks throughout the day if needed.

* **Alternate Day Fasting** - Just what it sounds like, no food every other day.  Eating days are normal. Some ADF approaches allow minimal intake on the 'fasting' day.

No doubt there are many more, some more mainstream than others.  IF is employed in many different ways, but none can lay claim to being *the* IF plan.  

So, remember, intermittent fasting only describes periods of not eating.  Specific fasting/feeding times (and how you eat when you do) are relevant only to whatever or whoever's protocol you're following.

Just came to brag about all my hard work paying off and to remind everyone to stick to those New Year's resolutions.

Little backstory: Scrawny seems to be the natural state for the men in my family. We're blessed (and cursed) with a rather extreme metabolism. We can eat anything anytime and as much of it as we possibly can, and while our innards would probably rot we'd still be our same weight.

After being dumped by my girlfriend and dumping my addiction to MMORPG's on the same day late last November I decided to basically reinvent myself physically and mentally. It was an effort to try and discover who I really was away from what I used to be which I realized was horribly dysfunctional and self harming.

I was completely new to the topic of lifting weights so during December I lifted light and focused more on proper form. Not that I had much choice though. When I started I couldn't do a dip, a pull-up, a sit-up on the decline, and maybe 10 push-ups. I sought to educate myself as much as possible if I was going to commit to this. I lurked here, found other sources, and picked my brother's brain as he took me under his wing. When 2012 hit I made it a goal to hit 160lbs by my birthday (about a pound a week). And without droning on too much more here are my confidence boosting [results.](http://i.imgur.com/tvyhO.jpg)

*The 'before' pic is already one month in of going to the gym. My normal weight is 135lbs (I'm 5'10"" for clarity), but my true start weight was about 130lbs. I was pretty depressed having parted with two significant components of my life so suddenly.

**What I did:**

* Stopped eating out as much and started eating anything and everything I could at home.
* After I started to plateau early March at ~154lbs I made it a goal to hit 4000 calories a day and started counting them using myfitnesspal. I also took GNC's Re-Built Mass after I realized 4000 calories a day is absurd. Every other day though, shit is expensive. Half expecting to be berated for that but it worked.
* My workout regimen I got from my other brother who is in the USAF. The only way to describe it is brutal and certainly not for beginners. It's easier to show you than explain it actually so I'll do just that. None of us use this program anymore so the secrets haven't much use to us now.

1361258738.0,398,self.Fitness,18t2f6,"After struggling with depression, exercise turned my life around. Here's how I learned to love the gym. ",504,106,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/18t2f6/after_struggling_with_depression_exercise_turned/,"Hi guys, I posted this testimony in /r/depression, but I thought it might be useful to some of you fitters who are struggling with energy levels and/or motivation, even if you wouldn't consider yourself depressed. 


We all hear that exercise is vital to overcoming depression. Great. I forced myself to go running or lift weights, was extremely bored during longer runs, and ended up more tired afterwards than I was before. I just assumed that my body was not meant to handle exercise, and I envied those people who seemed full of energy and were in great shape.


Then, one day, I decided to try something new. I knew that exercise was important, but I knew I couldn't maintain a schedule of something I didn't enjoy doing. Seeing as how I was in the middle of an interesting novel, I decided to bring that book with me and read while I did some light pedaling on the stationary bike. I figured this wouldn't really do much in terms of exercise because I had the resistance way down and I wasn't pushing as hard as I could. So I ended up reading for a bit; I could tell that my heart rate was up, but I never really got out of breath. Before I knew it I had finished two chapters, 30 minutes had gone by and I was drenched in sweat. And I felt great! It was honestly the first time I had enjoyed working out.


So the next day, after classes, I decided to try again. I wasn't sore or tired from the day before like I usually would have been, so I was able to bike for another 20-30 minutes and had another great experience. I kept this up every day and I actually LOOKED FORWARD TO GOING TO THE GYM (never thought I would say that). Each day was more productive than the last. I no longer wished I had the energy to go do homework or go out with friends. I was eating less than I ever thought I could survive on. I just wasn't hungry, and I had more energy than I ever have had in my life. I finally felt like I could relate to all those super athletic guys who are always positive. I had become one of them!


Eventually, I got cocky. I decided that I had turned my life around and was a new person. I stopped getting on the bike, and lo and behold, a couple days later I found myself working through a bag of potato chips watching tv and just feeling too lazy to do anything. One quick trip to the bike fixed that feeling.




So, my main point is that when you exercise, don't focus on cramming as much work as possible into your time at the gym. This may seem counter-intuitive, but try to enjoy the experience. Don't work so hard that you're panting for breath by the time you leave. Find something that you can enjoy doing for 20-30 minutes, because this is (from my experience and research) the time needed for cardio to be fully effective. There is no magical amount of exercise that will help you. You can't just work out and try to get it over with as quickly as possible. If you don't enjoy your workout, you will dread going to the gym, and you won't go. Trust me. I finally discovered riding a bike with almost no resistance (I've since turned up the resistance as I develop more muscle), and reading a book, since I would get bored thinking about nothing for 30 minutes. For you, maybe you could jog while listening to an audio book, or while watching a TV show. Or walk a few times around a lake. Or swim peacefully while blasting classical music from a boombox.

But find something that works. Because exercise is honestly the only thing that I've ever found to help me, and the change in my attitude and life in general since this has happened has been extraordinary. I really can't even fully describe it.


**TL;DR:** Exercise is the only thing that has ever helped my depression, and the transformation has been remarkable. The key to effective exercise is not to get it over with as quickly as possible, but to find something that you can enjoy doing for about 30 minutes without wearing yourself out in the process.

Edit: I wanted to throw in a reply to a comment I made, which I think explains why this has been so effective-- If you think about the way our bodies are built, exercise was never meant to be an end in itself. Exercise was how humans hunted animals, built shelter, and played sports. All of these activities are mentally engaging as well as physically. Now that we have a steady supply of food from the supermarket, and lead individual lives which normally don't include sports or building our own shelters, we have no need for exercise. This is why I think our society has such a problem with obesity and depression. Our lives have been made so comfortable that exercise is no longer necessary. Thus, exercising just for the sake of exercising without any kind of purpose (like hunting an animal or building something) can often feel boring and pointless. The key to enjoying your workout (imo) is to find an activity that engages you mentally as well as physically.

People reading this probably don't know much about me, but I can get quite nostalgic.  So as I entered this workout into the little green notebook I bought at I think it was CVS, I felt a bit of that wistfulness.  The final page in the notebook has been filled.  The first workout in it was from November 19, 2007.  I had only been in Boston a little over two months at that point.  My life was so different; no masters degree, I hadn't even done my first bulk or cut yet.  I was probably about 173 lbs at that point, at about 11% bf.  So here it is with the first page folded out, and the last page on the left.  The little perforated parts ripped a bit on both of them so they're loose leaf now, but they'll go into my folder with all my other old workout logs/sheets/plans.  It's great to see the progress; if you look at the workout on 11/19, my incline bench peak was 145 lbs. for 7 reps, and I peaked at 210 on bench pressing.  I was wondering at the time I started that notebook, if I would ever get to push the big big weights.  I had improved my diet, and gained some strength but didn't see it explode. It wasn't until about a year after this that I did my first bulk and started to grasp truly how to gain strength, power, and speed.  What a great 5 years it's been in the gym.  I always wondered as I carried this little notebook around with me, would I ever lose it before I completed it, and should I just pull out the completed pages.  Now that it's done, I'm glad I didn't.  I have plenty of loose-leaf pages from the years in the gym, documenting probably about 90% of my workouts going back through the nearly 14 years I've been doing this, but this is the first complete bound volume.  I think for my next log I'm going to do one workout per side of a sheet, maybe 2, and take more notes about how I'm feeling, what I'm doing, why I failed a rep, etc.

More than several times the verbatim words ""too many obese Canadians are at risk for death because they don't have the time to wait for the surgery"" were spoken. This enraged me for several reasons;

* There was a segment on how some people respond to food like an addict to drugs (increase dopamine release etc.) Of course I agree with this 100%, being formerly overweight myself I can empathize with this feeling and know it all too well. What bothers me is these people resigning their lives to obesity and when being told this disease will kill them, accepting the fate unless they have this surgery. Where are the documentaries about the poor heroin addicts who unless have some sort of surgery will die if they continue to use heroin? The sympathy for alcoholics who instead of giving up drinking, just say ""oh well, this affliction will kill me so thats that""?

* This documentary does a really awful job of portraying surgery wait times in Canada. Our doctors are busy treating people who have no option other than surgery. You're on a 5 year wait list? Why not use that time to try and take any miniscule step to better your life? I don't want to start any BS about our healthcare system vs. any other, but essentially the way it works is order is determined by severity and immediacy. 

* Obese people watching this now have justification for their lifestyle since 16:9 didn't cover a single alternative method for obese people to approach improving their quality of life other than surgery. I completely agree obesity and food addiction is a disease but unlike cancer, or AIDS, or any other plethora of incurable diseases, obesity can be treated through a lot of fucking hard work and a little bit of motivation.

I just wanted to wrap with I am in *no way* prejudice against the overweight. If you're obese and in this subreddit reading my rant, good for you for educating yourself about fitness and questioning what you can do to improve not just your physical appearance, but your overall health. I can relate with how shitty it can be to be overweight (I used to not be able to shop at the mall since no clothes fit me) and it takes a lot of hard work and courage to make the first step to changing your life. But being told your current lifestyle will kill you and accepting that fate, then lashing out at the world for not providing you with a free fix fast enough is not something I'm okay with.

That giant shirt is my husband's shirt. For quite some time, I had to wear his clothing because unless I wanted to buy mumus, I would have had to run naked. I still have 50lbs more to go, until I am just simply obese. How awesome is that? I cannot wait to proclaim my simple obesity to strangers on the street! I know a lot of extremely obese folks do not believe that they can do it, but this is a lie. How is it possible?

No more sodas, at least not for the first few months. After abstaining for awhile, you'll lose the taste for super sweet crap, and you will not want to eat it. Same goes for candy, energy drinks, and anything salty. Most people will go by fat grams and carbs on food, but I learned early that if it's got a lot of salt in it, it probably has a shitton of fat and sugars and I shouldn't eat it. Aim for salty items that have &lt;5% of your daily salt intake. That's twenty delicious items to eat a day!

Buy real food. Packaged junk is probably what got you into this problem in the first place. Frozen vegetables are just as good as the real kind, and you don't have to worry, as much, about spoiling. We eat out twice a month, it is a special treat. The rest of the month I bond to my stove, making many varieties of stir fries with chicken meat. Yum! Learn to cook! I suggest [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Cook-Everything-Completely-Revised-Anniversary/dp/0764578650) There's 2000 recipes in there, and hell there's something that's bound to tickle your deliciousness gland.

Exercise. It's your friend. I started out in the midst of winter, with a pair of headphones and a pair of gallon water jugs. By spring I could walk two miles without needing to break. I know it's hard to go outside when you're really heavy, but you can start inside. Walk in place, lift your jugs above your head and dream of the sweet freedom that lies just beyond that door. When you do go outside, don't let the snarky stares of people force you back indoors. You are stuck with you, not them. It's your body and YOU have to live in it, so do what you need to do! I work out at least an hour a day now, and I can outrun my twig friends. It is glorious.

Keep tabs on your progress. I take pictures and measure myself, weighing myself every month or two so I don't get hung up on the pounds. The pictures thing is surprisingly useful, because over time you'll be able to see the difference. Woo! DIFFERENCE BITCHES!

I do not know what else to say. I was just super happy and wanted to share the news :)

**edit**
Wow! Thanks for all the well wishing! I didn't expect this to get so many upboats and nice comments! I'll just answer some of the stuff up here since I can't hope to reply to everyone. I didn't restrict calories or carbs, I eat anywhere from 1800-2400 calories a day, the extra is usually when I eat out or am really active that day. Don't feel bad if you can't be really active in the beginning. Remember, you are carrying more weight on your frame than most people at the gym would even try to lift. Don't get discouraged if you get stuck, you can probably tell by my measurement chart that my body fluctuates weekly depending on what's going on with my lady cycle and water retention from working out and things.

So pretty much I joined a gym call Vision Quest,

I met with a personal trainer who's goal it was to help me reach my goal of 100 pounds off.

We made my own diet with at first being calorie deficit and burning calories. Later we changed that to a more better round diet of more fruits veggies cutting out all fast food and flavored drinks.

I was running up to 2 hours a day at incline 15 with speeds ranging from 2.5 to 5mphs, Coupled with daily 2 hour MMA training classes with full contact grappling.

Always every other day I was doing boot camp and Ab-labs to help supplement everything.

*bench press 210lbs when i started it was only 120lbs. 
*Leg press was 450lbs now is 1250lbs(maxed) most of the time i just used 800 and move up.

I can jump higher, run faster, and overall have better feeling.

When I first I began exercising I was 16, around 170-ish cm tall (5'7"") and weighed around 74 kg (163 lb). 

I bought a cheap set of dumbbells that maxed out at 10 kg each. I used them 3 times a week for about a month or 2 at a time before giving up for a couple of months before getting back into it. I did this on and off until around the end of 2010/early 2011 when I bought a bench and some proper weights.

I started to get serious and started working out 5 days a week, but had to take a 6 month break from damaging my shoulder not long after starting. Have also had to take a few month long breaks later on. I've never really been able to do a proper shoulder workout before because of this. 

Now I'm 19, 178 cm tall (5'10"") and weigh around 75 kg (165 lb). I have been cutting for the last few months, involving a lot more cardio into my routine.

I'm ~173cm. My starting weight was 74kg, finishing weight was 73kg. The before pictures were taken after a bit of a debaucherous Xmas. 3 weeks in I submitted my thesis so I took a one week break where I stopped counting and drank a lot.

[UD2](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/ultimate-diet-20) (also [forum link](http://forums.lylemcdonald.com/forumdisplay.php?f=9)) is just a type of targeted or cyclic ketogenic diet over a 7 day cycle as styled by Lyle McDonald. For 3-4 days you do what is not unlike a PSMF (protein sparing modified fast) and a whole lot of high-rep ""pump"" exercises to deplete muscle glycogen. Then you do a moderately heavy workout and start carb loading, after which you do a power workout. When glycogen depleted your body preferentially diverts carbs to replete your reserves and tends to overdo it. This can result in improved performance and recovery, while still losing bodyfat.

I was moderately strict, though I didn't go crazy. In general I kept the carbs lower than recommended in the book... but I drank quite a bit on weekends which no doubt hindered my fat loss.

My lifting progress over the 6 weeks...

* Deadlift 3RM: 120kg to 137.5kg (previous 3RM PR was 130kg)
* Bench 3RM: 65kg to 75kg  (previous 3RM PR was 70kg)
* OHP 3RM: 47.5kg to 57.5kg (previous 3RM PR was 52.5kg)

As I said I've been lifting for a few years and had plateaued many times on these lifts, so this was a big deal for me!

I was swimming for cardio at the beginning, bad technique gave me swimmer's-knee and prevented me (unfortunately) from squatting much at all after the first week. I also didn't do much of any dedicated cardio after week 2.

Anyway... **[here are my photos](http://i.imgur.com/a3Ngi.jpg)**. AMA. I'll try to answer any questions though am busy at the moment so it might take me a bit to get round to them, but don't worry I will.

 **Edit:** A few people are suggesting I look stronger than my lifts suggest. I didn't actually think my lifts (apart from bench) were that weak. I remembered then that it's standard here to post them in lbs. So here are my current calculated 1RM (3RM/0.9) in pounds.

* Bench: 183lbs

Went to this Cajun restaurant last weekend with the plans to go and have some drinks afterwords and catch a movie.

http://i.imgur.com/mksBI.jpg

Starting out on the left would have been around 4 years ago. I've lifted with countless friends and watched them get great gains in short periods of time and has definitely made my journey bitter sweet.

Left picture weight was around 120 pounds at 6 feet (track/cross country).
Right is 6 feet 170 pounds.

**My biggest mistakes I wish I could tell every hard gainer/small bone structured individuals:**

- Diet is key (eat a ton of calories with lots of protein, if you want size, no point in lifting for if you don't eat).

- Keep increasing weights. My biggest problem was I always attempted to hit a certain rep count on a certain weight. This caused constant plateaus. I.e. I would attempt to bench 150 pounds for 10 reps before moving up weight. * I quickly learned my fastest gains have come when I constantly go heavy and keep moving up the weights.*

- Log your workouts!


This is really only the beginning of a life long passion and I hope everyone can stay committed and feel confident!

I finished benching my 5x5 and felt brave, so I decided to find out what my ""tired 1RM"" is. I asked a dude on the other bench to give me a spot, he stood by as I easily completed the rep and said something like: I could never do that and then started doing his set. I got stunned by that, he was wearing a rock climbing t-shirt, his forearms were massive and he looked pretty damn strong, but the guy was considerably smaller than me so I decided not to say anything, until I saw him benching.

Half height, odd grip width, very high bar position (above his shoulders), was following the bar with his eyes, so it was wobbling all over the place. So I waited for him to finish and at the risk of sounding like a twat, said: to be frank mate, you're not even benching this [referring to his current weight], he paused for a second and asked if I could explain myself. I asked him to do another set and then watched him do all of these things again.

I said ""you should go lower"". He said that he can't and to go lower, he needs to reduce the weight (I smiled), but then he doesn't feel like he's pushing himself. So I unleashed all the critical points that Rip makes in his book. Dropped 20 kg off his lift and asked to do another set, with these pointers in mind. He barely finished it (failed on the last one) and said, damn that's hard.

We started talking and he said that he's been in this gym for 3 years and he works out a lot, but never even knew that there was such a thing as proper technique and this was his first time hearing about compound lifts and the importance of technique.

I generally keep my head down and my lifts up and rarely talk to anyone. The fact that in 3 years, in this gym, no one had ever even tried to correct him, infuriated me beyond belief. The programme that he was put on by the personal trainers included bench press, but the instructor never bothered to correct his technique or to point out that ""half bench isn't optimal for strength increasing"".

I asked what his aim was and he said ""general strength increase"".

I told him about sl5x5, starting strength and the faq section on reddit.com/r/fitness we spoke more about nutrition and supplements. He was consuming every advice I gave and was really grateful for it and said that he didn't know and couldn't find such resources before and just stuck by what the PT told him to do.

My point is: there are people, who go to the gym, who religiously follow the advice of incompetent personal trainers and get hardly any gains as a result. If you spot one of them, see if they are willing to accept help and maybe point them in the right direction, it will feel good.

I look forward to seeing his strength levels shoot past mine.",,False,,t5_2qhx4,True,,default,True,t3_jifh6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/jifh6/i_broke_one_of_the_gym_floor_rules_today_and_it/,

Anyhoo - I was a juicer bodybuilder in my 20s so my joints are starting to feel their age. I mostly work out on machines where the range of motion is controlled. Managed to get this lean by substituting my regular meals with stack of vegetables.

So I finished University last year and weighed in at 13st 1lp (83.1kg or 183.4 pounds) I am only 5""7 (170.2 cm) so this is a rather large amount. This is all due to lazyness with cooking and no exercise. As a qualified Physiotherapist I decided it was time to sort myself out. First thing I feel is relevant is that I never considered myself ""fat"". I just thought I was a bit muscular and had a bit of weight on me. looking back now I realise this was wrong. 

Diet: Monday to Friday 

This (for me) is the key. I had exercised before but never did the ""dieting"". I cut out all sugary drinks and consumed far too much diet coke (not ideal but its what I did). I calorie counted and stuck to a deficit of 500-800 calories a day. I ate allot of meat (mainly chicken and beef jerky). 

changed my breakfast from having sugary cereal and maybe two bowls to having three weatabix and a banana (still do this every morning). 

Lunch was usually one sandwhich (where it use to be two) a piece of fruit and an energy bar. 

Dinner was always a decent meal and I usualy had some sort of desert. 

Weekends:

This was vital for me (I emphasise for ME). I had weekends off. no diet and ate what I wanted (within reasonable limits).

Tip- no eating late at night really helped me get out of that habit of needing to be stuffed to sleep. 

Exercise:
for the first six months I just did cardio. 30 minutes 5x a week. Usually a 15 minute cross trainer and 15 minute uphill fast walk on the treatmill (sometimes some rowing was thrown in).

after 6 months I started my mini bulk and cuts- 2 week stint of weights followed by two weeks of cardio. It was this that meant I went from just being slim to having some muscle to show. Weights would consist of:

day 1: Arms and chest

day 2: Back and Abs

day 3: legs

i did 4-5 sessions a week. making sure I never exercised aching muscles. During the bulk phases I changed my diet. no calorie deficit (in fact increased) and high amounts of meat. 

i now weight 138 pounds. 

This worked for me. I never felt i was missing out on nice food and now really enjoy exercising. I still have weekends off and my diet is less restricted. I still eat far to much fizzy drinks (but everyone has their vices). My next goals are to keep going on the bulk and cut to gain a decent amount of muscle but i aim to stay lean rather than bulky.

1287415048.0,383,self.Fitness,dstv1,Ten foods you should be eating,487,104,301,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/dstv1/ten_foods_you_should_be_eating/,"Here's my list of things that should be in your kitchen - especially if you're attempting to lose some body fat and/or be as healthy as humanly possible. I have absolutely no qualifications - just an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Please - post your own if you have them. Of course, everyone should be eating more chicken, broccoli, and spinach, but here's some more variety:  


**Berries**. All of them – even if you’re doing keto. They’re super low calorie, taste amazing in everything (add some chopped berries to cottage cheese/plain yogurt and peanut butter), curb the sweet tooth, flavonoids up the wazoo, and are nutrient-dense to the brim. They’re both nature’s dessert and nutrient delivery system.  Ten strawberries (120 grams) have 38 calories, 7 grams of net carbohydrates, and well over 100% of your vitamin C for the day. 



**Fish oil**. Omega-3s: the source of a bajillion health benefits. Everyone should be supplementing with this on a daily basis. Also great for fat loss in controlled studies. (Thorsdottir I, Tomasson H, Gunnarsdottir I, Gisladottir E, Kiely M, Parra MD, et al. Randomized trial of weight-loss-diets for young adults varying in fish and fish oil content. Int J Obes 2007.) As a general guideline: liquid is better than pills; fish oil should not have a fishy taste.



**Wild Salmon**. Almost a second-parter to the previous entry: wild salmon is getting a healthy omega-3 intake in taste and style (you'll find a much higher omega-3 content in wild fish, so spend the extra couple bucks and upgrade to the [better tasting] wild salmon). They have a good amount of protein and animal fats. Wild salmon is also the most goddamn delicious thing when grilled on a barbecue with salt, pepper, and thyme, finished with a squeeze of lemon. You won’t be hungry after a salmon steak and a side of leafy greens. 



**Whey Protein**. Besides the obvious convenience of having a complete, super-bioavailable protein source on hand at any time and the numerous health benefits (immune response, brain function, tissue repair, etc.), replacing carbohydrate/fat calories with pure protein will have you coming to your next meal less hungry (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17964616), provide a thermic effect (which translates to less calories), preserve muscle mass when cutting (with a proper exercise program, it'll lead to an improved body composition/support current basal metabolic rate), and possibly even slow absorbtion of sugars into the bloodstream (I'm not too sure about the science of carb-crashing - it seems to be more anecdotal than research-backed). Plus, they can be pretty damn tasty if blended with some ice and milk/water (my French vanilla protein tastes like ice cream when blended). I treat whey like a daily dessert. Note: many manufacturers use artificial sweeteners in their whey protein shakes so do your research on possible health issues.



**Coffee/Yerba Mate/Green Tea/Black Tea/Oolong Tea**. All of these drinks are zero calories on their own. Caffeine aids in fat loss as a thermogenic (even better when added with ephedrine – but make sure that you dose correctly if you take this route - I can provide links if necessary) and an ergogenic (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/481158). Drinking a morning java suppresses my hunger until lunchtime. Yerbe mate has about the same amount of caffeine as an espresso, so it’s a fine substitute for tea drinkers trying to get in some extra caffeine. When you’re first drinking coffee/yerbe, it may act as a diuretic, but your body will quickly adjust to this. Green teas have less caffeine, but they also have special polyphenols/catechins (epicatechin, epicatechin-3-gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate) which boost norepinephrine production, aiding in prolonging thermogenesis. EGCG supplements may help if you want this effect without drinking lots of tea – however, I recommend drinking the tea as I'm not sure how well they work on their own.


**Extra Virgin Coconut oil**. Coconut oils are satiating, delicious, and energy-boosting for a large amount of people. Medium-chain triglycerides don’t need to go through the lymphatic system and be digested by bile salts, so they’re digested very quickly and are used very similarly to carbohydrates. Although it can be expensive (a small tub runs me about $30), coconut oil is a necessary saturated fat to have in your diet. [A randomized double-blind clinical trial with 40 women exhibiting obesity found that supplementation with coconut oil promoted a reduction in obesity without causing dyslipidemia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19437058). Add it to stir fry, fried eggs, desserts, and/or anything/everything. Damn thing is magic - especially if you're a fan of the coconut flavour. 



**Kale**. Go to your grocery store. Go to the fresh produce section. Step away from the lettuce (if you do anything, at least grab the spinach). STEP AWAY. Pick up that leafy monster. Never tried kale? Roast it with some olive oil in the oven (until it turns dark and brittle) for a crispy and super-healthy popcorn alternative. You can also add it to stir fry, boil it, steam it, and/or generally cook the hell out of it. Use it as filler with a piece of meat and some healthy fats (nuts, animal fat, olive/almond/macadamia nut/sesame oils) to stay satisfied longer. Kale is a flavonoid, vitamin, and an isothiocyanate (anti-cancer) delivery system. It’s the complete micro-supplement.



**Omega-3 eggs**. The whole damn egg. None of this “whites only” bullcrap. The omega-3 eggs have documented omega-3 fat content that’s mutiple times higher than the alternative (three-six times the amount in most cases) by having the hens eat a diet that’s more flax-rich. However, eggs are better than no eggs, so get whatever you can on your budget. I ate a dozen whole eggs a couple days ago (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). 85 calories, 6 grams of fat, 6 grams of protein, incredible nutrient density, a million ways to make them, relatively cheap protein source, they’ll keep you full for a lot longer than a bowl of cereal, and the cholesterol won’t do anything significant to your blood cholesterol in almost everyone. Eat them up. 



**Almond butter**. Usually considered a bulking food, nut butters in moderation are fantastic at keeping hunger at bay and introducing good monounsaturated fats into your diet. Don’t, for heaven’s sake, buy anything that *isn’t* an oily mess when you open it (solid means hydrogenated oils – one of the most terrible things you can put in your body). There should be a layer of greasy goodness. Pro-tip: store it upside down for a couple days and mix it well. Don’t be pouring that goodness down the drain. There should be (at most) two ingredients: the almond and maybe salt. If you’re one of those people that finds it difficult to control intake of peanut butter, almond might suit you a lot better. Try putting a spoon in the middle of cottage cheese or yogurt to add some texture. Almonds, of course, have excellent health benefits and micronutrient profiles.



**Your favourite food**. Sure, you might stick with healthy foods for a majority of your diet, but diets are by-large a mental game that develops your final physical state. It’s hard to remember to let yourself enjoy the stuff that makes you happy, whether it be cinnamon buns, Lindor chocolates, or a massive rack of sauced-up back ribs. In the long run, as long as it’s not an everyday type of thing and you keep your intake within reasonable amounts, it won’t make a measurable difference. Have a meal every week or two where you indulge in your favourite food(s) as part of your diet. It’ll keep you sane, prevent binges (once you add your favourite foods to your scheduled diet, you won't be romanticizing the memory of them), and (most importantly) keep your favourites just a stone’s throw away. Eventually, if you’re anything like me, cheat meals will usually turn into oatmeal and whey protein (not to say that I don’t enjoy a good pizza or Chinese when I feel like I need it).

I am now a size 2 (sometimes 4, depends on the brand). My weight last week was 123lbs. I ran 3 miles in 33 minutes, my best time to date. I quit smoking cigarettes. And the biggest accomplishment of all: I actually feel kinda good about myself for the first time in my life.

Here is a [pic](http://imgur.com/GHATn.jpg) I took this morning.

Thanks for listening, Fittit :) 

**EDIT:** Holy shit guys, thank you for the overwhelming comments. Sincerely, thank you. A lot of people have been asking for more details on my weight loss. I will try to keep this short.

I lost about 15 or 20lbs over a year just by cutting down on junk food and soda, which I used to take in a *lot* of. Just since May of this year have I lost the rest. I cut out soda almost completely, as well as takeout and fast food. (Though once in a great while I indulge!) I ate sensible meals, smaller portions, and healthier snacks. I also stopped smoking as much, maybe 3 or 4 cigs/day (down from 1/2 pack).

In July I finally forced myself to start going to the gym. I began slowly, setting reasonable goals for myself that I knew I could reach quickly. For a couple weeks I rode the stationary bike, then I did about a month on the elliptical. I found [this](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) program and decided to give it a try. I actually impressed myself with how well I did. I started going more often. I also used the Wii Fit Plus game several times a week. I have now discovered that I fucking love running. I feel great while I run and I continue to feel awesome for a long time afterward. Now that I quit smoking, I find I can run longer and faster. I have set a goal to run a local marathon next summer.

I reckon I'm one of the only normal people there. It is a local gym, not aimed at foreigners.

Here's some examples of the freaks I have to deal with every time I am there:

* The people who walk backwards on the treadmills.
* The almost psychotic levels of selfishness amongst the gym goers. (This is a general problem in China, but that's another conversation).
* The staff member who walks around karate kicking the machines thinking he's impressing women. (It seems to work).
* The staff smoking in the gym...
* The crazy bitch in tiny hotpants who does all her open-legged yoga stretching in the middle of the free weights section. (There are 3 or 4 empty yoga rooms).
* The older dudes (hard to tell, but probably in their 50s/60s) who sit on all the benches all day talking to each other and acting like alphas. (They do hardly any exercising). They couldn't give two fucks that they are blocking people from using equipment.
* All the skinny Chinese dudes walking around wearing gloves thinking they are alpha. (They are about the size of a 13 year old white boy).
* NO ONE changing the weight setting in the machines. They just sit down and start pumping.
* The people with the cling film wrapped around parts of their bodies...
* The selfish pricks who bring radios with them at full blast listening to talk radio.
* Most people wearing jeans and shoes.
* And in general, the complete lack of understanding of weight training, exercising, etc. Most people are probably injuring themselves.

It's so weird... I think I need to change gym.

Edit: new weirdness at the gym tonight: an angry looking Chinese guy who kept staring at me and using equipment immediately after I was finished with it.

1328768009.0,372,self.Fitness,phhba,Marijuana: How it helped me reach my goals,689,317,371,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/phhba/marijuana_how_it_helped_me_reach_my_goals/,"*Note: I think the most important thing to mention here before I get downvoted to oblivion is that marijuana helped ME, and in no way do I think it will work for everyone, or every goal. **I wanted muscle gains**, and lots of it, but for someone who plans on losing weight or cutting, marijuana would probably have a different fit in your lifestyle*

As a no-longer skinny guy who's put on exceptional amounts of what feels like almost pure muscle since I began hitting the gym, I am a big proponent of marijuana as a supplement (I started vaporizing marijuana pretty much daily at the start of this school year). For reference, I'm now a 6'1 180lb male and I'd describe my build as 'cut'. For the first time in a long time, I'm almost truly satisfied with my physique, and as a result I feel I have some sort of credibility.

**Now, the subject at hand**

Marijuana helped me overcome a few things, really.

* I never want to stop eating, and this is perfect for my goals (muscle-mass gain). I'm also more likely to enjoy foods I would otherwise dislike, making dietary changes feel non-disruptive in relation to my appetite. I do most of my eating after lifting earlier in the day, and **consuming these huge amounts of man food never seemed so easy.**

* **I can control my sleep, meaning I can control my recovery**. I can take a proper dosage of marijuana and fall asleep in &lt;15 minutes. More importantly, it helps me have a real desire to fall asleep. I've always struggled with getting enough sleep. I've seen some people claim proper sleep's relation to muscle recovery is bro science, but either way it feels good being able to sleep an appropriate amount of hours, and I really do think my recovery has improved.

* I no longer associate soreness with discomfort. In fact, I associate it with positive sensory feedback. I love stretching while sore now, and while I think the soreness pain disappearing may have something to do with my body adjusting to the change of lifestyle (consistently more eating and strength training), I have now come to enjoy the soreness, as marijuana makes stretching those sore muscles feel so good its like orgasm. Ultimately, **it makes me want to become sore again, helping me with progressive overload.**

What I'm getting at here, is that marijuana has really helped me achieve my goals so far. I'm sorry if this is hard for you, a reader, to believe, but it's the truth. I don't want to start some huge controversy over the legitimacy of marijuana as a supplement, I just want to share how it helped me with a change of lifestyle that was more physically promotional.

I hope there's an audience out there with similar goals that can draw something positive from this. Please, if you think you're a member of this audience, **ask me anything you'd like and I'll try my best to answer**. I'm no fitness guru, but I've found something that really does work for me.

############**EDIT:#######**

Wow, this thread really took off. Thanks for everybody who has shared their experiences, asked questions, and provided counterpoints. I just want to state to all those people who have taken an interest that marijuana **IS NOT A SHORTCUT**. It's not going to make you get up off the couch and go hit the gym, and it's usually not going to make you stronger while you're at the gym. But, for those who have the willpower to get off the couch and hit the gym, marijuana can really help in that change of lifestyle and have a great positive impact on your attitude, it's all just a matter of controlling when and how much you use.",,False,,t5_2qhx4,True,,,True,t3_phhba,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/phhba/marijuana_how_it_helped_me_reach_my_goals/,

I'm not a huge contributor here, but I do love to read and soak up the culture. That said, I have a topic that I'm dealing with more and more in my daily life.

I never did particularly much in the way of research or extremely formal routines, but I've maintained a strict schedule for the better portion of the past five years, my entire tenure at college. Over time, and with a good diet, I've developed a body I'm quite proud of. My time here at Fittit has propelled me further than before with the use of different routines, but that's not what I'm discussing.

I work in an office environment - I'm sure many of you do the same. As such, many have the ""bankers body"" - slovenly, slouched, poorly dressed, unkempt - fat. Some of these people I would call my friends, some not as much, but they all seem to have a common enemy - anyone that goes against the flow. By and large I'm one of the very few fit men in my office, we likely comprise less than 1% of the total.

There are frequent comments on the food I eat, from silly comments (""Dude, is that cat food?"" to tuna in Tupperware) to downright insulting my palate, telling me it's definitely not worth it to maintain a healthy diet. It's not coming from a place of ""you're missing out on good food,"" it's one of ""I don't understand you, so I'm going to insult you.""

I frequently manage to shrug off the one-liners, but some people can be downright spiteful. Coming from a management position, being young and in shape I get *a lot* of spiteful looks and commentary.

My question is, how many of you have to deal with something like this?  Does it get any easier?

**TL;DR album http://imgur.com/a/fWFjf#AuevJJW

**Stats:** 

* Height: 5'11"" 
* Weight: 174 lbs
* Age: 21
* Body Fat: Not sure, probably around 10%-12%
* Bench: 265 lbs Squat: 275 lbs Dead: 315 lbs OHP: 155 lbs

**Routine:** 

* I lift six times a week using a three day split. 
* Beginning of the week is heavy, back half more focused on hypertrophy. 
* Sun--Chest/Tri, Mon--Back/Bi, Tues--Legs/Shoulders, Wed--Chest/Tri, Thurs--Back/Bi, Fri--Legs/Shoulder

**Sunday--&gt;** 

* Bench 1x5, 1x3, 1x1  
* Narrow Grip Work 
* Incline Barbell 
* Dumbbell Flies 

**Monday--&gt;** 

* Deadlift 1x5, 1x3, 1x1 
* Weighted Pull Ups
* Some Variation of Rows 
* Preacher Curls 

**Tuesday--&gt;** 

* Squat 1x5, 1x3, 1x1 
* OHP 1x5, 1x3, 1x1  
* Lunges 
* Shrugs
* Straight-legged Deadlift
* Shoulder Raises 

* Wednesday, Thursday, Friday are the same splits with much lower weight and higher volume with additional accessory work done, depending on how I'm feeling at the gym. 

Here's an example of one of my high rep days: 

**Wednesday--&gt;** 

* Bench 3x12 w/ ~60% of my 1RM, Drop Set down to ~40% 
* Incline Dumbbells--I go pretty light on these to where I can do 3x15. Dumbbells are great for giving your chest a good aesthetic look, as well as providing important work to stability muscles, IMO. 
* Dumbbell Flies--Light enough to do 3x20 
* Accessory tricep work--These exercises vary from workout to workout, depending on what I'm feeling and what's available at the gym (I lift in a crowded college gym). 
* These hypertrophy days are all about getting a good pump and really feeling a good burn. Although they're light weights, your last reps should be extremely difficult to bang out. 

**Other Stuff:**

* I will do some core work about twice a week but I get most of it through squats and deadlifts. 

* I don't really follow a program right now, but I've taken bits of different programs and incorporated them into my routine. 

**Diet:**

* Chicken breasts are the staple of my diet. I usually eat two whole chicken breasts with some quinoa and some vegetables for lunch and dinner. 
* Four eggs for breakfast, along with two pieces of toast for breakfast, when I can. 
* Two scoops of ON Gold Standard after workout. 
* I drink a shit ton of milk. Probably two gallons of whole milk a week. 
* Snack throughout the day on fruit and almonds. 
* Canned tuna 
* GREEK YOGURT
* I try to keep my alcohol intake down, but that can be difficult sometimes in college. 
* Supplements: Creatine Isolate, Fish Oil, homemade pre-workout consisting of 200mg Caffeine Pill, Beta-Alinine, Arginine. 

**My Story:**

I've always been active and I love playing all kinds of sports. I played baseball and hockey throughout high school but I was never very familiar with the gym. 

Once I got to college, I decided that I wanted to get serious about lifting. I suffered a few setbacks, though. My freshman year, I broke my collarbone (hence the scar across my shoulder) and then tore my ACL the next semester. I was pretty fucked. Once I got healthy, I committed to working in the gym and missing as few workouts as I could. 

This is my progress! By no means am I satisfied, but I'm pleased with my gains so far. I'd love to hear any suggestions you guys have. Unfortunately, I've been working through a plateau lately so I'm looking for ways to move past it. Send me your recommendations! 

Thanks, guys. 

**EDIT: It seems that the main criticisms are calves (not surprisingly, I'm not happy with them at all) and some issues with my routine. I appreciate you guys being constructive. It's nice to be able to come to a sub like this and get quality advice. I'm always trying to get better.**

**EDIT 2.0: I don't mean to be misleading. This progress is after a year of serious weight training. In my before pictures I had somewhat of a base for lifting, but I had no idea what I was doing in the weightroom. Like I said, I've been active my whole life and I think that gave me a little bit of an advantage going in to training. We all start from different places. All that matters is that you're working hard and making progress!**

I'm a fairly skinny guy who's only recently taken up weight lifting. On the suggestion of /r/fitness amongst many other places on the net, I decided to start with Starting Strength, and I've been going strong for about 10 weeks now.

My gym is a fairly standard fare, not really designed with free weights in mind, but unfortunately it's my *only* option. As part of our membership, we get a free ""personal training"" session when we sign up and every eight weeks. My first session wasn't very helpful, mostly taking measurements, planning out a machine-only routine that I made clear wasn't what I wanted to do, and going over a few of the machines. When it came to my second session a few days ago, I'd hoped we could move past that and actually correct my lifting form, but unfortunately it was more of the same.

This time, however, somebody noticed that I wasn't following their set plan. They had been emphasizing that their routine was optional, but while I was doing my squats I had a trainer come up to me and confront me about this. I explained that I had my own plan, and asked him if he could correct my squat form quickly. Annoyed, he observed me for a few squats before saying that I was doing it wrong (without specifying where I was going wrong) and that I should stick with their plan for a few months. I was hoping that I could just leave it at that, review my form as much as possible and hopefully correct whatever I was doing wrong, but just yesterday I had the guy at the counter tell me to stick with their plan.

I want to learn how to lift properly, but unfortunately it looks like the only way I'll get anyone to correct my form is to pay for a personal training session with the gym, who by the looks of it will just put me on the machines anyway, and it's hard to train with the trainers looking over my shoulder.

**Waist before:** ~40 in. (101 cm)

**Wieght after:** 180 lbs (81 kg)
**Waist after:** 32 in. (81 cm)


**Background:**
I grew up competitively swimming from a very young age (~7 years old). I was an athletic kid all through middle school and high school. Unfortunately, because I was exercising so intensely through my adolescence, I never really learned how to eat properly. Once I went to college to study engineering, my exercise schedule changed drastically (disappeared really) but my diet did not. I was aware of the weight gain, but never really bothered to do anything about it. The changes were so gradual from day to day that I never found the motivation to re-think my eating and exercising habits. After 3 years, I needed a physical from my doctor and found out my cholesterol levels were through the roof as well as slightly elevated liver function tests. Combining my family history of high cholesterol and my current lifestyle, I was on the fast track to major health problems if I kept it up. My doctor said I was just over the borderline of medication, and I left the doctors office with a prescription for cholesterol lowering medication. 

That day every thing changed.

I was determined develop proper eating and exercise habits. Weight loss was my number one goal. Approaching it from a scientific point of view, I was consuming more energy than my body was burning and all the excess energy was being stored as fat. The plan was simple, **eat less and exercise more**. It worked. Fantastically. Don't let the simplicity of what I did fool you, it was the single hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life. What makes it hard is the constant, unending, relentless struggle against hunger and the desire for food as well as the motivation needed to push yourself to work out. It was brutal to say the least.


**Diet:**
The first and most important thing about my diet was limiting caloric intake. Less than 2000 calories a day, preferably around 1600-1800. The easiest way to get down to sub 2k in a day is to cut out sugar. Sugar is so incredibly energy dense, it ruins any attempt to keep your food consumption down. No more soda. Drink water, and lots of it. The first two weeks were hell, my stomach hadn't finished shrinking yet (yes, it will shrink) and the desire to eat was unbearable. After a while, it got easier to manage. Allowing yourself a cheat day where you don't count calories every couple of weeks will really allow your sanity to remain stable. Eventually it became habit, and the pounds fell off like magic. After I got used to the amount of food, I focused on eating healthier foods. No processed food. No fried foods. No soda. The things you should eat are whole foods, things that grow out of the ground, fresh meat, fresh whole grains, fresh fruit, fresh vegetables. In fact, I ate mostly vegetables. They fill you up and have next to nothing when it comes to calories. 


**Exercise:**
I didn't focus on exercising until my weight had significantly dropped (to around 200 pounds). Most of my exercise was cardio. Running, in fact. I have come to really enjoy running and I try to do it at least 3 times a week for 2 miles or more each time. I experimented (and plan on continuing) doing bodyweight exercises from [SimpleFit](http://www.simplefit.org). It consists of sets of pull ups, push ups and bodyweight squats. I started out just hanging from the pull up bar, not even being able to move, to doing more than 10 without stopping. It feels great to be in shape. I'm a regular reader of [/r/fitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness) and I  am going to keep up with my exercise and improve as much as I can.


**Conclusion:**
Weight loss is NOT impossible. If I can do it, you can do it too. Stay strong. Stay focused. Every single drop of hard work will be rewarded ten fold in the end. And remember, nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.",,False,,t5_2qhx4,False,,,True,t3_iyxsy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/iyxsy/one_year_and_90_pounds_later/,

Doing something, anything at all, has to be better than doing nothing. And doing even the simple things is probably more enjoyable in the long run than declining to go out with friends because you have to drink a shake and eat a lizard's tail.

You might need to trick yourself into being better.,574,204,145,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/klm70/want_to_be_better_you_might_need_to_trick/,"An interesting new study appeared in my newsfeed this morning on using deception and competition to coax more performance out of athletes.  This study had trained cyclists run a set of 4000m time trials on stationary bikes to establish a baseline time for the TT.  Then they ran two more time trials using computer avatars, one of which they were told would represent their baseline time from the earlier TT with the other representing their current ride, and they were told to try to beat their baseline time in both of the avatar TTs.  However, what they weren't told was that in one of the two races against the avatar, the avatar was actually programmed to ride at 102% of the power output from the baseline ride.  In both rides, the cyclist beat the avatar, and they were able to beat their old baseline by a significant amount when racing against the deceptive avatar (while barely beating their baseline when racing against the non-deceptive avatar).

[The abstract for the study can be found here](http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/publishahead/Effects_of_Deception_on_Exercise_Performance_.98845.aspx); if anyone can get a full copy of the paper, I'd love to read it.  Also, [here's a good story from the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/health/nutrition/20best.html) covering the study (and a related one).

The NYT story is nice because it mentions two other related studies. In one study, the subjects were told that the avatars would be going faster that the cyclists' baseline, and every cyclist gave up as the avatar started pulling away. [In the other study](http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/publishahead/Influence_of_Competition_on_Performance_and_Pacing.98839.aspx), the cyclists were told that the avatar they were racing against would be another cyclist behind the screen, when they were really racing against their own best time. With the sense of competition against someone else, the cyclists were able to beat their own best times handily.

The researchers have hypothesized that the body is willing to sacrifice more of its anaerobic resources if the mind believes it will allow the body to win the competition, but not if it believes there's no hope.

Joe Weider was a titan in the fitness industry and one of the kindest men I have ever met.

I knew about Joe Weider long before I met him - he was the godfather of fitness who told all of us to ""Be Somebody with a Body."" He taught us that through hard work and training we could all be champions. When I was a young boy in Austria, his muscle magazines provided me with the inspiration and the blueprint to push myself beyond my limits and imagine a much bigger future. I know that countless others around the world found motivation in the pages of his publications just as I did, but as I read his articles in Austria, I felt that he was speaking directly to me and I committed to move to America to make my vision of becoming the best bodybuilder, to live the American dream, and to become an actor a reality.

Joe didn’t just inspire my earliest dreams; he made them come true the day he invited me to move to America to pursue my bodybuilding career. I will never forget his generosity. One of Joe’s greatest qualities is that he wasn’t just generous with his money; he freely gave of his time and expertise and became a father figure for me. He advised me on my training, on my business ventures, and once, bizarrely, claimed I was a German Shakespearean actor to get me my first acting role in ""Hercules in New York"", even though I barely spoke English. As my career took off, he was always nearby, giving advice, promoting my movies or my crusade as the Chairman of the President's Council on Fitness in the pages of his magazines, and appearing at my fundraisers and events when I decided to run for Governor. He was there for me constantly throughout my life, and I will miss him dearly.

He leaves behind a fantastic legacy of a fitter world. Very few people can claim to have influenced as many lives as Joe did through his magazines, his supplements, his training equipment, and his big-hearted personality. Joe was known for urging everyone, “Exceed yourself,” and there is no question that throughout his life, he did just that.

My thoughts and prayers are with his extraordinary wife, the love of his life, Betty, and all of his family and friends.""

Edit:
 **Need to make it clear that these BF%s are guesses, Before I started lifting I had a gut and I didn't even have the outline for abs, so I might have guessed higher than I should have, but they are guesses.... from looks not from measurements or anything.**
According to Body Fat Friday, my before and afters both seem to be around 14% and my guesses were bad.(Guess I just felt more unfit, so I felt like I had a higher BF% than I did... instead of all the people calling bullshit on my gains, why not just say my BF%s look off!!! Jerks.. )

Not the most impressive transformation, but I'm really proud of myself and hope to inspire more than just my friends.

My goals for the summer are visible abs and a clear shot at playing on my university's soccer team.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Edit: Sorry I forgot to give information about my routines, dietary information, practices, etc... Here's a basic rundown of what I've been doing.

I've been running every day except for when I sprained my ankle and foot on two separate occasions. I do at least four miles and if I'm feeling adventurous I'll do 6 or more.

Starting in about March I began doing the Insanity workout doing only the ""Cardio Abs"" video every day. I know it's not intuitive to the program, but my foot was still injured and there was only a little bit of stress on the foot from that routine so I went ahead and did that with my roommate. Doing that alone strengthened my lower back a lot so I no longer have back problems at all and they used to be really bad. I've told most family and friends about it when they complain about their back.

Towards the end of March this year I began lifting regularly after my foot got better and I was less intimidated by the gym. I went every day for a few weeks mostly trying to get used to the weights themselves and to test myself as a human being. I do a mixture of dumbells and cable machines while still doing exercises from the ""Cardio Abs"" video with a medicine ball incorporated into each exercise and I've still been running every day.

My favorite physical/athletic accomplishment was running 6 miles in 50 minutes (to take a break to watch the sunrise) at 8,000 feet in Yellowstone National Park on July 2nd (which may not seem like much, but I grew up and live at sealevel.)

As far as what goes in my body, I eat what I have access to. Poor college student funds only go so far. I've survived off of top ramen and chili mac, but I put broccoli in both every time, and put an egg into my top ramen. I never drink HFCS or eat processed sugars and fats (my friend accidentally gave me a soda a few months ago and the carbonated syrup made me feel nauseous.) I've taken a strong liking to V8 juices (the vegetable and fusion ones) even though they're kind of high in sodium. However, I've been drinking a lot of water as well which offsets my high sodium intake a little: about 200 ounces of water per day which I know is kind of unhealthy since I'm only 5'11"" and weigh 190. I think this combined with the regular exercise has prevented me from getting sick at all and I usually get two really bad colds per year.

Another thing I indulge myself in a few times per week (since they can be expensive) are fruit and vegetable smoothies. My favorite right now is strawberry banana spinach almond with a large dollop of fat free yogurt and a few teaspoons of unprocessed sugar. Gives me a lot of energy and is really refreshing with the summer heat.

Unfortunately I don't have gym access right now during the summer quarter so I've had to do a lot of body resistance exercises which has gotten me very innovative and creative as far as how I do my reps and routines even though it's been a little unsafe at times, but that's how we all learn right?

If you guys have any questions for me feel free to ask them. I'm by no means a fitness expert. In fact I'm quite the opposite since the only thing impressive about my physique are my legs and I can only thank a lifetime of playing soccer and tennis for that. But I'm just trying to live healthier and having stronger lungs has REAAAALLY improved my skills as a musician. In fact that was the main reason I started exercising more, because my range on French horn literally increased by half an octave after a few months of running alone.

Also, coming out had a lot to do with it. I was more free to be myself so I donated my hair to locks of love, came out of my ""shell"" and began working out. My friends actually think that my long hair was like a barrier of insecurity that I put up to hide who I was.

I'll preface this by admitting I am far from knowledgeable in regards to nutrion based science, especially relative to some members of r/fitness.

My analysis/experience is far from scientific, as such, if anyone cares to break down or elaborate on the micro level by all means.

Ok, so I practiced a keto/CKD diet for almost a year. I went very low carb. Here is what I found personally:  Rapid fat loss.  On the negative, I eventually found my energy levels to deteriorate before stabilizing.  I did not put on any noticeable size.  Constipation.  Eventually I noticed despite being quite lean (ripped) my muscles took on a 'sinewy' look (carb depletion of water holding glycogen I would imagine).  Looking back, kinda looks gross/not that aesthetic.  See pic 
[Keto diet pic](http://i.imgur.com/Y9iC4.jpg)


More recently (about 2 months), I've been following the leangains diet (slightly longer fasting period, shorter feeding window).  I prefer this metho for the following reasons:  More freedom in diet (sweet potatoes, other starches), less time preparing meals, fall asleep easier (most of my calories before bed), regular (no constipation), higher energy level, strength gains and a 'fuller' look.   Looks like retaining some extra water in pic 2, but more aesthetic in my opinion.(warning underwear)

I've seen this a few times now, so let me lay out the new program. It is now a progression. All are still done 3 non-consecutive days a week. 

A: squat, press, deadlift; B: squat, bench, deadlift. Done until the deadlift is stronger than the squat.

A: squat, press, deadlift; B: squat, bench, power clean. Done until chinups would be useful. It is implied that this is when the press/bench first stall. /edit: see [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/scsbw/fyi_the_ss_program_has_changed_with_the_3rd/c4czitl) for some disagreement over the wording; you might rather just move on after 2-3 weeks rather than waiting for your bench/press to stall. 

A: squat, press, deadlift; B: squat, bench, power clean, chin-ups. Done until the deadlift and/or power clean stall. 

A: squat, press, [deadlift/power clean]; B: squat, bench, back extensions, chin-ups. Done until progress is no longer made, and at that point the athlete needs to move on to a new program. 

We probably want to start referring to the newest edition as simply being ""SS"" and refer to older editions by their number (e.g., SS 2nd edition). That's the usual practice with books.

I did [THIS](http://newbie-fitness.blogspot.com/2006/12/rippetoes-starting-strength.html) version of SS that I got from the old /fit/ sticky. I'm really enjoying it so far and I have noticed signifigant gains in strength and aesthetics.

**Diet:** Since im in college and have a meal plan almost all my food comes from dining halls. I try to get the healthy stuff but its sometimes not avaliable. I never eat super greasy food though like chips and pizza. I count calories and I aim for around 3200-3400 a day with about 160-180 grams of protein. 

**Supplements:** I use ON whey protein and take about 2 scoops a day, right after lifting on workout days. I also take creatine, 5g every day. Other than that I just take a ""One a day"" multivitamin and fish oil pills for general health.


Im going to stay on SS until i stop seeing steady gains but it seems like i still have a few months left on this program. If you have any questions on what I did feel free to ask!

I do so and my mother whips out my whey protein and goes, ""What the fuck is this?. Hughhh, What the fuck are you taking steroids?"". I sit some what dumbfounded at their ignorance. I try to explain what whey is and how all athletes take it...to which she responds, ""what like Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa, those fucking juiceheads???"" I ask her if she had read the label at all or done any research on her own, to which she responds no. I tell her shes being ridiculous and to calm down but she refuses to yield. It took two weeks to get the protein back and convince her to calm down. Now, I have to wait for all my packages to arrive cause God help is she discovers the creatine, pre workout or anything else, while she takes her happy pills.
Anyone else had parents or friends react stupidly to protein?
TLDR;  Mother finds my whey, thinks its steroids, accuses me of being a juice head and refuses to give it back for two weeks.

Edit: It appears ignorance concerning supplements isn't confined to Jersey. Now a days, its much better with the parents. I even have my sister taking whey, since she's training for soccer in college( they still don't know she's taking it though). I'll admit, I may have been dickish in my argument, but the set up to it was absurd. Months of stating that I was getting out of shape and such and then all of the sudden when I get in shape, it's an alarming thing.

I'm a big guy and go about my business either running or lifting and am usually there for two hours generally 3-4 days a week. The employees know me, but we never talk. That's how I am in life. I say ""Hi."" and ""Have a great night."" When I'm leaving. 

But last night, I went to my gym of the last three years. Let's call it Schlanet Plitness. I've walked by what I guess is called their circuit training zone many times before and a friend had recommended I try it out. So I decided to indulge tonight. I even went so far as to ask one of the more friendly employees how I do it properly. Awesome. I went from machine to machine, IN ORDER, starting at the labeled #1. 

About 40 minutes later, after having to do multiple sets on machines because people had jumped in front of me. A manager comes over and asked me to leave the area. 

Confused, I asked why.

His response was, ""You're not doing this right. And if you do multiple sets wrong you're messing up the rotation of these girls over here."" (points to starting area)

I laughed. And explained that I only did multiple sets on machines because people had been jumping in front of me all night. And that I'm too nice of a guy to say something, or even care. 

He still asked me to leave. And I refused. I said I had two stations left and I know I may not be doing these the way other people are, but I pay to work out at this gym and if he's judging me for being a big guy in this zone, then we'll have problems. 

He asked me to leave. 

And thankfully before I even decided to get up off my machine to really yell at him. A guy that was running on a machine behind me the entire night had decided to vouch for me. And the employee left. 

I thanked the guy and we went off on our merry way. 

After I let the locker room and was heading out to my car, an employee came up to me and apologized. And while I appreciate the apology, it was the fact of the matter that I was being singled out just so this dude could, obviously, get in the good graces of the girls in the zone. 




**Tl;dr:** Muscle-head employee at gym got in my face and asked me to leave. Stating that I was in the wrong even though I wasn't.

* Age: 22
* Height: 6ft2
* Weight: 82.1 --&gt; 84.1

Lifts all to 5 reps. I have not tested 1RMs. Progressions be seen visualised in the top album.

* Bench: 40 --&gt; 62
* OHP: 30 --&gt; 45
* Deadlift: 70 --&gt; 120

See paragraph 7 of personal for explanation of different starts on chart and initial drops in weight lifted.

[The program I'm using is practical programming from here.](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/The_Starting_Strength_Novice/Beginner_Programs#Practical_Programming_Novice_Program:)

**Diet:**

* **Breakfast:** 5:30AM 2 eggs scrambled or boiled and a coffee or tea (some veg if there's any going spare)
* **Lunch:** 9:00AM-13:00PM (variable depending on schedule.) Essentially silverhydra's Meat Slop, piece of fruit, Mars bar and a packet of crisps. Check the food album at top for details on ingredients in meat slop.
* **Dinner:** about 200g of chicken, beef, fish, sometimes lambs/chicken liver or cow/pig heart if we can get it. This is with rice, pasta or potatoes and as many assorted veggies as will fit in as well. Usually onions, peppers, mushrooms, leek, kale, spinach, carrots, parsnips etc etc. Whatever we could buy that week. Maybe a chocolate muffin and a cup of tea.

**Supplements:**

I've not been supplementing until the last week or so. Now I'm taking:

* Fish oil
* Vitamin D
* Creatine 5g (since 7 days ago.)

I felt better in general since working out but these have made a real impact. In all honesty I think most comes from the vitamin D (live in UK and work in windowless office most days) and the better hydration to account for the creatine. Since starting these supplements my thoughts have been clearer and my work more efficient. I've had 3 large projects to finish this week just gone. I set target finish times for each day (doing a specific project a day) and was finished between 2-4 hours earlier than I aimed for on all. Usually I over-run by about 1-2 hours.

**Additional:**

Usually I would sleep about 5 hours a night. I cut back Reddit time to get to sleep earlier and now get between 7-9 hours depending on work/timetabling. 

I had no target for weight loss or gain and limited funds so I couldn't buy substantial amounts of additional food. I was bang in the middle of a healthy BMI range so took the approach that; if I started losing weight I'd need to either stop or find a way to eat more and that it didn't matter if I put on weight because I could just lose it later. 

With this in mind; if I was offered food at work (buffets etc) I would take it and eat as much as I could stomach focusing on meats. As it turns out my weight hasn't changed much.

**Personal:**

During my second year of Uni I was a failing student. I'd gotten worse since the first year and it wasn't looking up. I wanted to do research so I spent the summer learning a bunch of skills to fix my grades in the final year. I went from a 3rd in the second year to a 1st in the final year narrowly missing a 1st overall average for the degree. 

The side effect of this was I literally internalised myself for over a year. I worked hard and got results but I basically stopped everything but mental exertion. I was previously pretty active having done Parkour and gymnastics regularly. 4 years ago I used to be able to do 15 chins fairly easy and I've only recently just broken back into double figures.

The grades got me on an MSc and I spent the year telling myself if I could just afford a kettlebell I could workout. I never did. I'm now on a paid 4 year MSc(1yr) PhD(3yr) and managed to reapply the approaches I took to my grades to my working out. In preparation for starting the course and being at the Uni I started doing bodyweight workouts. Not with any particular goal other than habit formation. I figured if I could get back into a routine of working out I'd be ok going back in. 

Once I started Uni I stopped working out.

A couple of months in I started to get into it again and realised I'd not bothered to adapt the routine to my new schedule at all. I tried to find some friends who ""worked out"" and get a regular session going ASAP. I picked SS practical programming as a routine on the premise that early on, it's less important *what you do* but rather *that you do it*.

Almost straight away my friends weren't interested as I wanted to do ""He-Man lifts"" i.e. not bench or curl. So I started going on my own, early (hence the 5:30 breakfast as I have a 2 hour commute) and just focus on my own goals. I also swapped my reddit bookmark from the front page to /r/Fitness and added a bunch of fitness related bookmarks to keep the ideas ever present in my brain. Even if I wasn't reading I'd still be constantly reminded.

I made huge mistakes early on. You can see my lifts drop dramatically on bench and squat after the first few sessions. This was because, once the guys had left me, I realised their ""spotting"" was a lot more like ""lifting"" and I'd not really been lifting the weight myself. I did some big deloads across the board and have posted form-checks to /r/weightroom since to make sure I'm on the right track. 

Since then I've just kept focused and taken a policy of checking my behaviours once a week for improvement but otherwise refusing unsolicited advice. I did not believe the whole ""curlbro"" mentality fit jokes about was a real thing till I started working out. Multiple times I've been referred to as ""the squatter"" and told I'm going ""awefully low on those squats"". 

I feel much better already. I feel even better since supplementing which I hadn't thought possible and I feel **even** better in myself. My self-esteem is growing as is my confidence and I've already caught myself behaving in ways I would never have previously. I can't wait to keep going with this.

Finally; short term target is to get to a bodyweight bench press and I anticipate staying on this routine until at least then. At that point I will re-evaluate my goals.

---------

EDIT: To those of you asking about the skills I developed for learning that helped me get from a 3rd to a 1st: I'm ever so slowly building a resource for a website on these techniques as they are little beyond the scope of a short post. I'll be sure to message people if it ever gets to a presentable quality. I'm also doing a 2 hour video presentation on speed reading (including a bit about the actual physiology of the eye and why most ""speed reading"" is bullshit).

Additionally, for your enjoyment here's a PM I received from /u/TheHH . This guy is a real comedian:

&gt;I don't know what is more embarassing, your shamefully slow progress for two months, or the fact that you decided to write a long and detailed post about it. First of all, you squat less than my anorexic 14 year old niece. Second of all if she or any one else that wasn't a functionally retarded infant did SS, they would gain 35 pounds on their squat in a week, not 2 months. Rippetoe/any one who actually knows anything about strength training/fitness would throw up in their mouth if they saw that. Also, to not only post your shitty nonexistant progress but your life story is probably the most cringe worthy thing on the internet. Luckily you posted it to reddit. Don't feel special you autistic DYEL faggot. Maybe next time do something remotely impressive before you waste your time writing a post about it.

**Background**

I have always been fairly active (martial arts and fucking around at the gym), but in late 2008 my GF got pregnant, I got my first full-time job with overtime, and I broke my ankle in a bike accident.  My diet and training went to shit due to the lack of time and stress.  I gained over 20 pounds of flab due to frequent ice cream and other crap without working out consistently.  I still had a decent frame underneath, but it was covered with too much flab for me to be happy with it.

Soon after seeing that image (with the sexy pink goggles), I realized how much I disliked the way I looked.  Not in a depressed, ""I am worthless"" kind of way, but rather in a ""I must constantly improve"" kind of way.  I find that with people who don't ""get it"", any kind of acknowledgement that there is room to improve, or that you don't like something about yourself makes them think you are depressed or emo.  For me it wasn't about that, it was about setting a goal and working towards it; emotions barely entered the picture.

For reference, I am 5'9"" and I have controlled the nominal weights for changes in beard mass.

*Lifts at start*

Bench: 185 x 1

OH press: Unknown

Squat: 225 x 3

Deadlift: 315 x 1



**Phase 1: 2010-08 to 2012-04**

In September 2010 I got back into my main training program for the last 2 years - Crossfit.  I know that program gets a considerable amount of hate on reddit, and in some respects I think that is warranted.  In my case, I focused on strength-related WODs, so the program was more like bench/OH press/squat/deadlift with HIIT.  That said, it wasn't as organized well and I wasted a lot of time working on form for Olympics lifts that I now realize I don't really care that much about (other than power clean).

During this period I didn't really get the results I wanted, so towards the beginning of 2011 I started following a ""slow carb"" diet without counting calories.  Basically I cut out all processed carbs.  This reduced the amount of junk I was eating but still kept me satisfied.  I ate all I wanted but just stayed away from ""bad"" carbs.  I know this is probably broscience, but I think it worked because the ""good"" carbs and proteins digest more slowly so I didn't get hungry.  Still not as effective as calorie counting though.

About 3 months before the image was taken I switched to 5/3/1.  This caused the biggest increase in my strength, but my appearance didn't change much.

*Lifts at end*

Bench: 215 x 1

OH press: 135 x 1

Squat: 295 x 1

Deadlift: 315 x 8


**Phase 2012-04 to 2012-08**

After the April 2012 shot I decided I wanted to be a little more aggressive with cutting, so I got smarter about my diet.  I stayed on the 5/3/1 routine with once a week hill sprints and started counting calories.

I lost the weight a lot faster here than I had intended, and in retrospect I wish I had done it more slowly, because I lost a nice bit of muscle and strength as well.  This was mainly caused by my lack of accurate scales, and I got hand, foot, and mouth disease towards the end which totally killed my appetite for almost a week and a half.

Cutting also sucked because I got sick more often.  I stuck to ""slow carb"" principles which I think made this phase easier, as I wasn't hungry too often.

*Lifts at end*

Bench: 205 x 1

OH press: 125 x 1

Squat: 295 x 1

Deadlift: 315 x 6


**Phase 3; 2012-08 to present**

After the August 2012 shot I switched to bulking on Greyskull LP.  I'm planning to gain very slowly to avoid as much fat entirely, and it seems to be working.  I also have functional bathroom scales which help me keep track.

I no longer track calories daily, I just track my weight.  If it doesn't move the way I want it to I track my macros for a couple days to ""recalibrate"".  This is working well.  I now eat ""fast"" carbs when I feel like it, but only after having a good meal.

During this phase and now I do not do hill sprints, but I ride my bike frequently.

My current goals are that within one year:

* Weight 175 at ~12% BF

* Increase my bench/press/squat/deadlift to 200x5/135x5/295x5/325x5 respectively.

*Lifts currently (I no longer go for 1 rep maximums)*

Bench: 175 x 5

OH press: 110 x 5

Squat: 215 x 6

Deadlift: 285 x 7

**Some takeaways**

* Counting calories works

* Structured, consistent programs work better than highly varied ones (for me anyway)

* Diet is even more important than you think

* Aim for smooth, consistent change rather than huge swings

* Keeping detailed track of your workouts and appearance is highly motivating

* Program types matter; strength programs build strength, hypertrophy programs build mass.  There is plenty of overlap, but don't be afraid to tailor your program to your goal.  If you mainly want to look good naked, take ownership of that and don't let anyone say that strength is a more noble goal.",,False,,t5_2qhx4,False,,,True,t3_129xxh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/129xxh/two_year_progress_pics_with_details_not_as_crazy/,

1342981165.0,362,self.Fitness,wz3jt,TIL that running on the treadmill efficiently requires upper body focus and coordination ,524,162,232,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/wz3jt/til_that_running_on_the_treadmill_efficiently/,"I'm 320 lbs and working hard to drop the weight. I own a treadmill and have started using it a lot in the past few weeks. I do HIIT for the most part. Today I tried running a mile straight with no pause on a moderate speed (~~3.2~~). (Edit: I believe, as some have pointed out, that I meant 4.2).  About half-way through the mile I was tempted to give up and either lower the speed or take a break. I pushed through this urge and kept going to the mile mark. During the second half of the mile I had a kind of a physical/mental breakthrough that made me realize a few important things about running. I wanted to share them here for anyone trying to run at 300+ pounds. 

In the past, I had no idea how important the upper body was for proper or efficient running. I must have been focusing on my legs, knees, and feet. Now, I am aware of the following items and will utilize them every time I run. 

*breath control: inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth in order to keep the inside of mouth moist. I had always heard this advice and never fully applied it. Today I fell into a kind of trance-like rhythm with my breath cycle. My mouth didn't dry out and I was able to focus on the sensation of air entering my lungs rather than how my legs/knees/feet were feeling (mild pain). 
 
*synchronize upper and lower body: swinging arms and legs in a precise pattern. I felt my right arm reach its apex at the same moment the left leg was fully forward. I shifted my focus slightly, allowing me to time my stride with the swinging of my arms and locking me into a much more controlled running pattern than I have ever used. 

*ab strength: my abs have become much stronger after 6 months of regular gym work. As my legs became tired and my back began to ache as it usually does, I pulled in my gut and kept running. My increased core strength helped me finish the last quarter mile, when, in the past, I would have given up because of the burning muscles and mild pain. 

*stillness: I held my hands and face loose for comfort. A few years ago I read that long-distance runners keep still every body part not involved directly in running. The article specifically said their hands hang loose and their face is relaxed. I tried these two suggestions and it felt good. No grimacing or balling my hands into fists. I think this is more of a focus thing for me and not so much an energy conservation tactic that a marathon runner might employ.

Tomorrow I will run again. I am curious to see how it feels to start the run off using the things I learned. I am hoping to work my way up to two miles in the next few weeks.

Over the last 7 weekdays I have, every morning at 9am, taken a list of the most recent 100 posts in the last 24 hour timespan. After making rough categories, the following is the average of the last 7 days which I feel is representative of fittit in the past few months:

  **The Data**

- Aesthetic Concerns (Looking better as it pertains to shaping and muscles rather than fat loss): 5

- Possibly Motivational (links or stories which had beneficial feedback and were created to help others): 5

- Community building (links of self posts with the aim of joining people together or creating a sense of camaraderie): 13

- Validate my social life (Conversation and validation of the self that does not fall into the previous two categories): **16**

- Validate my routine (Looking for feedback and validation of a current diet or fitness regimen): 3

- Picture, link, or movie that is beneficial to discourse and people: 10

- Picture, link, or movie that is for the lolz and fairly irrelevant: **8**

- Asking for recommendations for equipment or routines: 6

- Advice asking that is not covered by the FAQ: 21

- Advice asking that is covered by the FAQ: **13**

Total: 100

   **Personal concerns**

I bolded what concerns me. I personally have no problem with jokes and socializing, however the amount of threads dedicated to this topic is increasing rapidly. Post that fall into 'validate my social life' were deemed not community building as they did not help being people together, and they were not created with the aim to motivate. More than 10% of the posts of fittit were also questions that were **in the FAQ**.

This is also a community of 36,563 members at this time of this post; the turn-over rate is getting very high and people may need to start using search functions.

   **Representativeness**

To the notion of representation, only aesthetic concerns were large enough to warrant their own category. Other idea of fitness were put into either community building, motivational, or validate based on their context. ('Who else is an olympic lifter' were put into community building, 'I love swimming lol' were put into validate). So the next time one talks about how 'fittit is not all about looking good, losing weight, and free weights', the data I gathered says otherwise (aesthetics were specifics, all diet and weight questions were put in advice asking or community/validation).

   **Problems**

There has been a huge rise in the amount of complaints from people about the rise in unnecessary links and posts 'clogging' up the main page. The comments are no better in some cases. What concerns me is that these complaints are coming **from the most interactive, knowledgeable, and regular posters** of /r/fitness and those who contribute the most to the discourse here. I do not wish to alienate them.

  **Possible solutions**

There are two; either the community as a whole starts making /r/fitness more beneficial to it's members, or the moderators will.

Personally (I speak out of line here, and not of the other moderators), I will always favor posters who have been here for months on end and contribute beneficially to fittit's discourse over people who have just shown up and start complaining. Nobody in this subreddit is flawless, but the majority of flamewars are started by people who I have not seen before (given how I am on fittit 5 hours each day, I know you...). Regular posters are not given 'protection' in any way, but the benefit of a doubt. This may be the course fittit will take if moderators have to take action. It will be a better community, but people may be excluded. I do not wish for people to be excluded so I am open for other options.

Please Discuss.

   **Tl;dr**

Read it; the future discourse of fittit depends on your ability to hold you attention longer than a canine with ADHD.

**Edit**

It was just brought to my attention that the sponsored links forced upon us by reddit (no problems there) seem to have overridden the stickied FAQ. Will give consideration to fixing that.

**Edit2**

There seems to be some confusion that the goal of /r/fitness is a gathering point for people to talk and that votes are the end all be all. This is not 100% true. Although everything pertains to the vast definition of fitness, the goal of this subreddit it to help and discuss how to improve people through fitness. Votes count, but they are not the end of discussion.

At the time of this edit, the NSFW link 'Well-placed ad' has over 450 upvotes and troublesome's awesome thread about posture has 105. This is fairly normal.

**Weight:** 356.1 lbs

**Measurements:** PENDING (will be done tonight)

**Current status:** Easily winded, weak upper body, average/below average lower body.

**Lifestyle up to 7am this morning:** Sedentary

**Goal:**  Massive increase in stamina and strength. Minimum 60 lbs lost by wedding/cruise in September. Continued weight loss, muscle gain, and level of fitness afterward. Avoidance of Type II Diabetes that runs in family only because everyone is also a fat ass. Reach physical appearance goal by year end (loss of gut, man breasts, underarm fat, match pictures of individuals with preferred appearance). Obtain better posture, eliminate slouching. Maintain health/level of fitness until death.

**Current method:** Walk/jog/run 4 days a week in backyard 16 laps=1 mile per online Google maps distance calculator. Cut calorie, fat, and sugar intake. Cease all soda consumption.

**Planned additions to method:** Begin push up/sit up regiment. Obtain weight bench. Increase all activities/repetitions/weights/distances as they no longer become difficult. Learn boxing/kickboxing.

**Activities today:** 13 laps around back yard before needing to install new headlight in fiance's car prior to work; total distance 0.8125 miles. Walked first lap to get lay of land. Ran lap two, walked two laps (until breathing normalized, heart rate still elevated), fast jog lap five, walk two laps (repeated until lap 13). At beginning of lap 14 (jogging lap) noticed fiance watching from back porch, not comfortable being watched yet, changed headlight, showered, got ready for work.

**Research:** 3200-3700 calories per day to maintain weight depending on calculation used. Was unaware this amount or more consumed each day (never counted what was eaten previously), however not surprised with amount. Reduce intake to 2000-2200 calories per day. Do further research on barefoot running, obtain Vibram Five Fingers if barefoot running deemed best.

**Mini-goal achieved today:** Exercised for the first time in years. Threw away box of ice cream sandwiches in work freezer, Peeps marshmallows at home. Turned down donuts when offered by coworker.

I noticed a lot of difference. Its so good to see hard working paying off, and so far, walking the iron path has been the greatest thing I have ever done with my life.

For a shorthand, TL;DR version of the transformation; http://imgur.com/a/LDHyE

And for the long hand one, with more pictures, and also showing my progression to the flag; http://imgur.com/a/kTLXX

Took me 9 months, and I have gained about 17lb. I would like to gain that again, if possible, in keeping in line with my goals.

Initial goals;
Be stronger.
Achieve a Human Flag, and hold it.

How I did this?
Well, up till easter I did 5x5. I didn't run any specific programme, but was in the gym 4 days a week, and deadlifted, front squatted (no squat rack) and bench pressed every session.


After easter I picked up German volume training, and verious strength training programmes.

Ultimately, it resulted in me being in the gym for up to 2-2.5 hours a day, 3 days on, one day off. Effectively a 6/8 day split. I used bodypart and function splits;

Day1; ""Leg&amp;Abs"" -Strength 

Day 2; ""Push"" (tri's, chest, shoulders) -Strength 

Day 3; ""Pull""  (back, biceps, hammies, glutes) -Hypertrophy 

Day 4; REST 

Day 5; ""Pull"" -Strength 

Day 6; ""Push"" -Hypertrophy 

Day 7; ""Legs&amp;Abs"" -Hypertrophy

Day 8; REST

I alternate between strength training ideas, from 5x5 in dropsets/pyramid sets, to 6x3 in the lifts it is possible to lift like that (otherwise repeat 5x5). I have tried 3x(5,3,1) a bit, and its brutal, but I like it.

examples;

A typical (hypertrophy) Pull day;

-Deadlifts 8x10 (4x10 standard/snatch grip)(4x10 sumo)

-Dumbell Rows 8x10

-Good Mornings 8x10

-Bicep curls, Upright Rows/shrugs , Lat Pulldown, Hamstring curls, all 5x10, and supersetted.

A typical (hypertrophy) Push day;

-Bench Press 8x10

-Military Press 8x10

-Incline Bench Press 8x10

-Shoulder Raises, Rear Delt Raises, Laying Tricep Extensions, Chest Flies

A typical (strength) Leg&amp;abs day;

-Lowbar Back Squat 6x3 (I use high bars for hypertrophy)

-Front Squat 6x3 (to make up for the reduced ROM from a lowbar)

-Weighted situps 5x5

-Goblet squat, Bulgarian split squat, cable woodchops, cable crunches 5x5/6x3 in the cases its possible.

On all of the ""Strength"" days I try and get a set of cleans in aswell to ""warm up"".

I cycle 6 miles to the gym, 6 miles back, thats my low intensity cardio.

Gym always in the mornings

I sprint train every leg day, and on the strength ""pull days"".

As for diet, I just eat whatever I can. I have always struggled with eating, but I try to get my 5 a day in with fruit alone, to sate my sweet tooth, I get veg in a lot of my meals aswell, so if you aim to get your 5 a day in fruit, you will definately get enough micronutrients. I space 3 protein shakes through the day, and make a batch of chillie every week, so I always have a heavy meal available when I get home. I haven't bulked/cut, and don't intend to. I'm gaining lean mass and my lifts are increasing.

I know I should count my calories, I try, but I have a lot on my plate atm in terms of studies, sports, etc.

Other supplements/foods;
Creatine, beta-alanine, lots of fish oil.

The important numbers;

waist is 31"", chest is 42"", and shoulders are 51"", dick size has remained the same, can't do much about getting that bigger, no matter how much I need to :(

Initial Numbers;

-Deadlift; 220lb/100kg x 4

-(Front) Squat; 110lb/50kg x 5 
(I struggled getting any heavier onto my chest, and didnt have a squat rack!)

-Bench Press; 110lb50kg x 5

Current numbers;

-Deadlift; 429lb/195kg (almost hit 2 reps!)

-(Back) Squat; 319lb/145kg (low bar)

-Bench Press; 253lb/115kg

Recent achievement though was dominating 150kg (330lb) for 8x10 in sumo deadlifts, so next PR should shatter the old one.

My proudest PR however is my 10.95 100m sprint time.

[PICS],460,102,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/yuidj/finding_fitness_one_fat_dudes_9_month_journey_pics/,"Hey, Fittit! I've been really trying to get back in shape over the last 9 months, and [here are the results!](http://imgur.com/a/ZrOdd)

**My story:**

   I've always been 'bigger', but it wasn't always fat. In high school I was very active, football, wrestling, baseball, and the gym 5 days a week for 4 years straight. I lifted weights, ran a ton, and was just in all around good shape. 
   Fast forward 7 years, and I've ballooned from a solid 190-200lbs. up to  approximately 260 (I didn't have a scale before I decided things needed to change.) I went through a rough breakup, lost a house, lost my job, and became completely sedentary. I looked for work for a long time, even changing cities in order to find something. After awhile though, I think I just gave up on it all. Work, life, happiness. I managed to wrangle another girlfriend after my move, and she was awesome, but it didn't end up working out. (I had some issues with trust.) Anyways, yeah. I basically had given up, so I ate anything and everything I could. I can count the number of home cooked meals I had in a 2 year stretch on one hand, literally. I ate out *every* day.
   Last December I'd decided enough was enough. I'd entered a new relationship, and browsing Fittit, Loseit, and Keto, had galvanized me into believing that it was time for a change. I began with just diet (keto mostly, but I still eat fruit once in awhile, although I was really strict at the start.) After I had gotten down to around 220 lbs I was comfortable enough in my own skin to start hitting the gym, so I began going around 3 days a week. Now I'm in the gym 3-5 days a week, and comfortable enough to begin running/jogging out in public to build up cardiovascular endurance. But yeah, that's it in a nutshell. I'll summarize below.

**DIET:**

 
  Keto mostly, very strict at the start. Nowadays it's still Keto mostly, but I incorporate fruits every once in awhile, and have 'carb up' days to replenish glycogen when I feel like I need to. (Hard to explain, but I can tell when I need carbs.)
   I eat a salad every day at lunch, and a salad with dinner which is usually something meaty. I also drink tons of water, and unsweetened iced tea. 
   I fast just about every day for 16-18 hours.

**EXERCISE:**
*3 sets to failure, I increase the weight on every set by 5-10 lbs, depending on what muscle I'm using.*


Mondays and Thursdays: Chest, triceps, abs. 

Tuesdays and Fridays: Back, and biceps.

Wednesdays: Legs, shoulders, and abs.

**I'm just now getting comfortable enough with my body to run in public, that's why I haven't done any running yet. I promise I will be out there this next week!**



**TL;DR:**

  Got fat and depressed after high school. Years later, I'm not so fat!


  Anyways, thanks for being a wonderful community. I wouldn't have had as much success as I've had with all the information, and inspiration I've gotten from all of you!


Much love,

Any exercises and recommendations to tone out that section would be really helpful if anyone has suggestions. I can see my abs begin to develop more and more each day but the saggy skin is just hard to get rid off.

I'm a 28 year old (former) competitive cyclist, runner, weightlifter, and overall health nut. I feel very fortunate since first strokes usually don't end up with walking out of the hospital 5 days later.

**Symptoms:**  I'd just sat down to work in my home office in the morning after some intense cardio intervals and a cold shower.  I began to feel light headed and the screen became blurry.  I felt like I was being pulled to the right and I thought I was just fainting.  Once on the floor, my heart started racing and I realized I wasn't going to faint. I tried to stand up but could only get to my knees.  Got my cell phone and willed myself into the living room and tried to nap it off  but was overcome with an intense headache. Ate some peanut butter thinking it was diet related (I train fasted - intermittent fasting) and took some Tylenol but it didn't help.  My balance was off and I was walking to the right every time I tried.


**Cause:**  I tested positive for Factor V Leiden which is a blood mutation that makes my blood more prone to clotting.  (Luckily it's the heterozygous copy). This small clot, combined with a [PFO in my heart](http://my.clevelandclinic.org/heart/disorders/congenital/pfo.aspx) which affects 25% of the population created the perfect storm.


**Warnings:**  I was warned by my cardiologist about pre-workout supplements (I was taking Jack3d) and vitamin DHEA.  He treated a 29 year old for a heart attack after taking three 5 hour energys and also another young patient who had a stroke that was taking Jack3d.  No direct link yet, but I definitely quit taking it as did my friends.

The form would have been better, but it was my second go-around, and I just got done working my upper body right before. It was more of a test to see my progress, didn't expect I'd do it, but I was surprised I did!

After reading the FAQ here are some extra, fun facts!

Me on 9/01/2011 (I wasn't that fat, but I wasn't healthy). I was 190 pounds and still 5'8, so obviously not fit. 

http://imgur.com/tzhmc

Now: see the vid

Weight: 145
Height: 5'8
Age: 17

My progression:

First off, I had to learn each individual part by itself before even attempting the move without touching the ground. Prior to this I was already fairly fit, and had the strength required for the handstand. 

I had been doing handstand push ups with a wall for many months prior, the hardest part was maintaining balance without a wall. In order to overcome this I just practiced handstands until I could get one for ~10-15 seconds.

For the L-sit, my core strength wasn't as good. In order to build the core strength I would get on a pull up bar, pull myself up, then do hanging leg raises. When I built enough strength to do the L-sit, I began doing that to raise my core strength. Once I could hold that for 15-20 seconds I began attempting the move.

From there the hardest part was over, and I just kept trying to do the switch. The L-Sit was the easy part for me, the hardest part was maintaining strength and balance into the transition for my handstand.

My next step would be holding the handstand for longer, making it more fluid, but I probably could hold it for longer if I'm not tired. After I work out the kinks, I want to finish up my planche, then be able to transit from an L-sit to a Planche.",,False,,t5_2qhx4,False,,,True,t3_14t8z6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/14t8z6/yesterday_i_met_a_67_month_gymnasticbalance_goal/,

It seems lacking, but the Rubric on TGs is astounding.

I'm submitting it here so I can just throw out some thoughts concluding these last two weeks of research. In my opinion:

- Fish oil really isn't a panacea for everybody. I would actually minimize the importance of fish oil supplementation for somebody who is completely metabolically healthy. I'm personally going to stop supplementing fish oil as mackeral is already high in my diet, and am getting started on researching ALA and GLA to see if I should include them or not.

- For those at risk for disease states or currently unhealthy (this is overweight people, people with pre-metabolic syndrome, those 40 or above) it does start to become a panacea. Take it or eat lots of fish.

- The dose for preventative health is actually quite low (250-1000mg EPA+DHA) and neurology higher (1500mg DHA+, 1200mg EPA+). Doses might be a bit higher if you are on a high fat diet, as there is still some relation to the 3:6 ratio.

- It doesn't seem to increase insulin sensitivity, but it simultaneously suppressed insulin release while causing non-insulin mediated glucose uptake. In the end, this is kinda what people look for with insulin sensitivity anywho, so I guess the 'doesn't cause insulin sensitivity' thing is just semantics. For all practical reasons it has the same effects.

- There are some weird synergisms that I don't know why they happen. Fucoxanthin and Fenugreek? Weird...

We stumbled upon a recipe for Kale Chips. I gotta tell you, these things are seriously amazing and I had to share this with Fittit. They are only about **60 calories** per serving and are very satisfying. In my opinion, these are better than potato chips. Also, kale is like **89 cents** a pound at my local grocery.

Go buy:
1 bunch of kale,
1 tablespoon olive oil,
1 teaspoon salt

**Step 1:** Wash kale and dry with paper towels or a lettuce spinner.

**Step 2:** Peel kale leaves from stem with hands by holding stem at bottom and pulling up. Discard stem. If some stem rips off with leaves, it's probably okay to eat since it's thin. It will still crunch.

**Step 3:** Rip up kale into bite sized pieces and place in a mixing bowl. Mix in oil and salt until all kale is lightly covered. Trust me, light will do it.

**Step 4:** Bake on a sheet pan for 10-15 min at 350F or until edges are brown. Enjoy deliciousness.

Place any extra in a baggie for instant chips on the go.

**EDIT** Thanks for all of the suggestions everyone.

Well, it was squat day of 5/3/1, and this week was the third week out of four (and the heaviest of them all - the 4th week is a deload week). All of the sets went great up until my 95% of my max for 1+ reps.

I loaded up the bar, get myself set, and my stomach started gurgling. Oh boy, I thought, I better make this quick. First rep came easy. Second rep was more difficult. On the third rep, I went down, strained, and a geyser of diarrhea burst forth from my asshole. Luckily I was the only one in that section of the gym at the time, so I escaped unnoticed. I did the only thing one can do in that situation, I went to the bathroom, rinsed off my ass, changed back into my work clothes, ditched the shit-shorts, and hauled ass out of there before anyone could find my poo puddle.

Edit: Kind of feel like this needs an explanation. I added the ""at least I'm not black"" line about 10 hours after I posted this, because

a) I had 300 upvotes at that point, and blatant racism that is seemingly accepted by the masses on the front page of a mostly liberal website is funny.

and 

b) I wanted to see people's reactions. And damn, you've had some weird ones. One guy is sure that I'm referencing an obscure joke from the 1980's. A lot of people think I'm making a statement about the treatment of blacks throughout the history of America. Others think I'm referencing Louis CK. More think that I'm just a die hard racist.

Been going since late December, down 15lbs. since then (hooray!), my squat is up to 205 and my bench is up to 125 (I think I could do more but I don't have a spotter &amp; I'm nervous). I'm scared of deadlifts still but I have a friend who's agreed to show me how to do those properly soon so I'll probably start before the end of the month. Body fat is down from 35% to 29%.

I've been reading all these threads about what people want to say to the chubby dude who's lost weight or the fat girl who's working hard and so on. Let me tell you what a trainer at my gym did for me today.

First of all the guy was doing whatever the kind of exercise is where you take the bumper plates and stack them on a barbell--he had like 4 45lb. plates on each side--and from a standing start, lift it up to your chest, then press it over your head, then drop it. I don't know what that's called but it looked hardcore. Plus it's super-loud when he drops the rig and it bounces off the plywood base he's standing on.

So he was doing that while I was doing my squats &amp; I didn't realize he was a trainer at the gym--I've seen him around but just thought he was a lifter.

I finished all my lifts and did 25 hard minutes on the elliptical (I do HIIT hard enough that I practically fall off the damn thing by the time I'm done). I was walking back to the machine after grabbing a wipe to wipe it down &amp; I see the guy walking towards me, only now he's wearing his ""Personal Trainer"" jacket.

He catches my eye--I'm breathing HARD--and just gives me a very subtle thumbs-up and a nod. That's all. I nodded back and mouthed ""thanks"" in between gasps for air. And let me tell you: I floated out of that fucking gym.

I'm one of the people who would feel weird if someone came up &amp; said something to me. But that little gesture meant the world to me tonight, especially coming from a guy who was lifting what looked like a small car's weight from the ground up over his head over and over and over again the whole time I was doing my little weights.
