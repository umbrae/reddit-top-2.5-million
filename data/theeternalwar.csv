Hello,              

I would first like to say that this has been an incredible experience and I hadn't the briefest hope that this would gain so much traction. I came to reddit this morning seeking advice from what I assumed to be the incredibly rare and nearly extinct Civ II player. Instead, I was greeted with the open and willing minds of thousands ready to tackle the task at hand. I never dreamed that an entire sub reddit would be devoted to it. As you can imagine, this game means a lot to me. And to see so many so passionately writing their own narrative of what happened in this world, just as I have, is such wonderful vindication in its own right. Thank you. 

 I'll confess that I had great difficulty releasing this at first. Until I saw the fan fics, the flairs, the pulp, the intensity of it all. And realized it would be wrong of me not to.

That said, I've reviewed many of the comments and would like to address a couple of things. 
First: I will not be switching to fundamentalism. The Celtic people (in my personal continuum) are wary of it, considering their mortal enemies are theocratic; which is a wonderfully convenient way for me to rationalize the fact that I have issues with it from a game design standpoint. 
Second: On the Viking front, you will begin from a disadvantage. There are few ground forces to advance at this point. You will find that the game ebbs and flows. At one point you may have dozens of units, at another, very few. 
Third: The Sioux barely cling to life with four cities on a remote island. I overlooked this in the original post because they are largely irrelevant . Though I don't expect them to last long. The Americans have been pursuing them ruthlessly. 

So good luck and God speed! ",,False,,t5_2ua25,False,,Celtania,True,t3_uyswv,http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/uyswv/here_it_is/,

NOTE: Please do NOT read if you want to experience TEW completely raw.

Alright, so first thing first, I follow pretty much the tips I set up here: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/uz25x/some_quick_tips/

Be smart about what you're buying (Offshore Platforms are MANDATORY on any major coast city for any production to occur. Spend your treasury on THE FIRST POSSIBLE TURN to fast build them. Seriously, you could just stop here and be in a gigantically improved position).  In fact, here's a save where I spent the first couple turns selling useless buildings and building Harbors/Offshores if you want to skip doing it:

https://dl.dropbox.com/u/57682/Missions/cu_a3993.sav

You can easily get quite a few cities back up to a reasonable amount of production.  At the end of my game I had these cities over 30 shields/turn:

* Balamb
* Dinas Tirith
* Dukedom'Dollet
* Chateau'Dif
* Monte'Cristo
* Issus
* Selbina

Next: I only built two Engineers the entire game, you do NOT need them.  Doing the massive reterraforming of Earth is a lengthy and difficult process even if nukes weren't flying around.  The only thing these guys need to do is connect your cities with railroads.  Because you are only using the ocean you do not give two shits about pollution.

Taking on the Vikings:

Hopefully your alliance with the Americans holds, mine lasted about ~30 years which was enough to get production and build my army up reasonably.  Fighting a two front war would be much more difficult without a doubt.  First thing first, the two chokepoints shown in red are a pain to fight through and because they are undeveloped are very SLOW to fight through.  This gives the Vikings ample time to nuke or apply Stealth Bombers to you.  

https://dl.dropbox.com/u/57682/Missions/CELTSFUCKYEAH2.gif

Instead, I opted for a page out of MacArthur's book and performed my own Incheon landing.  There are two things to consider here:

* Your transport must be able to reach across the gap in one turn to prevent it being sunk.
* You want to land in a DEVELOPED area.  Use the Viking's own railroads against them.  Because of how intertwined my units were in their own countryside they never were able to successfully nuke my army.

Howitzers really should be the main portion of your army.  Fighting the triple-defense that City Walls gives is unacceptable if they've got Mech Inf behind them.

The follow-up here is where it gets interesting.  Because all of your production facilities are on islands, and transporting them would suck, we are going to abuse the *shit* out of airlifts.  You will probably have two major island producers of Howitzers and they shouldn't have any problem pausing production to build an Airport (or half build and half buy, you'll probably have the cash on hand by that point).

After the landing, I immediately purchase an Airport in Sydney and airlift every damn turn into there.  That, combined with the constant reinforcements from across the ocean (remember to move your transport INTO Sydney with units on it, they auto-disembark and save a movement point) opens up the soft underbelly of the Vikings.  At this point you can use their own railroad system against them and hit them in the cities towards the back where their bombers and nukes are located.  If Partisans break one of the railroads from Sydney to the rest of Vikingville, try to get an Engineer to at least stick a road there.   Howitzers fighting at 1/3rd can at least nail the ridiculously soft targets like Spies/Engineers/Missiles, but don't go throwing them away against anything harder at 1/3 strength.

As far as fighting America goes, they are very strong with air power (many Helicopters, Stealth Bombers, had 4 nuclear weapons when I fought them) but have a minimal ground force.  I got the jump on them with a majority of my Howitzer army and knocked them from ~430 units on map to under 250 in a turn.  The counter attack for the first turn was very strong (~18 units lost not counting the city they managed to nuke) but dropped off rapidly as their bombers lost the airfields they needed to base out of.  Their navy is nothing in comparison to the Viking navy, so if you have any veterans from that you should sweep aside the weak American navy without issue (2 Battleships, 1 AEGIS, 3 Destroyers, 1 Submarine was all I saw from the American navy).  You already have a strong railroad connection so the key here is just hitting them fast and hard, you don't want to get bogged down.

It’s been one year to the day since I shared my 10 (now 11) year game of Civ II, affectionately dubbed “The Eternal War”. In that time some things have changed, while others have not.  After my original post, I was overwhelmed with the response and number of helpful strategies and spent much of the last year experimenting with them. Of particular effectiveness was Stumpter’s 58 year solution which I was able to execute within a similar time frame. I’ve included the link to his strategy so that those interested may review its details themselves. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/uzm4w/took_58_years_ingame_but_i_pulled_it_off/

That said; in January of this year I decided to continue playing on my original save file, determined not to end this struggle through overwhelming force alone. I concede that at this point, armed with the knowledge that I have gained through this experience, I could if I want at any time, crush the Viking menace with relative ease. I continue the story now simply to see the narrative play itself out. Besides, keeping them around has its uses when considered from a certain perspective. Consider if you will, what need would there be for my glorious Celtic Communist state to exist in a world at peace? How would I justify to the masses the need for brutal dictatorship and big brother’s watchful eye if there is no longer an external threat to protect them from? I couldn't. And so the external threat must be maintained of course. The parallels of my Eternal War to George Orwell’s 1984 were of course apparent, but I have since decided to fully embrace our inevitable Orwellian future. Or present, considering the headlines. Whether it’s the NSA spying on our communications, Turks being brutalized for wanting to preserve a historic park, or President Assad of Syria butchering entire cities worth of his own countrymen to remain in power, there are many lessons from life to draw upon.
 
The year is 4200 AD. The world is a nightmare of suffering and devastation. This has not changed. Two more centuries of war have yielded no victor. But of course this is now by design rather than stalemate. Rather than destroy the Vikings, my largest operation of the 41st century was a massive naval and land offensive to capture the new Viking capital of Piza, with the intention of instigating a civil war among their people. This is something unique to Civ II, where a civilization would split into two separate civs if their capital was captured during a time of war. The naval campaign was a disaster. Viking cruise missiles wiped out most of the fleet along with most of the troops in transport before they ever made landfall. Eventually Piza did fall, but this did not result in a civil war as I had hoped. I soon withdrew from the city which was of course recaptured shortly thereafter. And so went 40 years of planning and preparation.

The 42nd century was dominated by an unprecedented number of uprisings and rebellions across my empire.  Every other year it seemed as though fresh waves would replace the rebels I gunned down the year before. Even with my overwhelming military advantage, it became difficult to cope. The rebels would appear outside some of my most developed cities and tear up the roads and railways before I could react. With the roads gone, it became an ordeal to move troops close enough to attack them.  Before I could, more rebels would appear elsewhere and thus divide my attention.  This culminated in the sacking of the city Shoreside Vale. At that point for the first time ever, I had more troops engaged in quelling rebellions than fighting the Vikings. And not because they were particularly powerful; but because there were so many and so disparate, spread across all reaches of my empire. Eventually I created a squadron of fighters, not bound by roads, specifically to engage the rebels so that the rest of my production could be focused on maintaining the status quo on the front lines. This is where things stand now.  My alliance with the Americans remains strong, and the Sioux remain weak. All is as it should be. I shall update you all on the situation once again before the end of the year. And remember: Big brother is watching….

I don't play Civ but this captivated me and made me think.

First off, I'd like a canon storyline. He has knowledge of 10 real-time-years and thousands of game years that no one else does. If he ever does finish,  I want to hear from him how it officially started and ended, rather than hundreds of various ways from different people.

Secondly, if I'd worked 10 years on ANYTHING, any sort of project... I'd get this pit in my stomach knowing other people are tampering with it. Even with their good intentions, it's my work. I'd want to be the one to finish it.

I dunno, my thoughts. Like I said, I don't play Civ and I don't know if sharing the file is a big deal or not, but hopefully Lycerius can see this and know I certainly won't judge him for not uploading his save for everyone to experiment with.

EDIT: Or even possibly, let Lycerius be the original winner, let him solve it his own way. Then, once he's content with his accomplishments, he can upload the file for others to conquer?

EDIT 2: I'm gonna clarify something. The first story will be out a day from now, two days tops. The entire series details the lives of three characters in the armed conflict. 

The Celt, Private Cadell, is on the offensive in Viking-held Kazakhstan. 
The Viking, Agent Nanoq, is a sniper in Greenland, which is being invaded by American forces.
The American, Isaac Ryan, is the mayor of a small town in the Sonoran Desert, which is being occupied by Celts.
The Siouan, Red Bison, is a Viking-hating sharpshooter on the Viking-ruled ""Free Sioux Reservation"" in Australia.

The four stories take place on the same day, September 23, 3991. 

There needs to be some clarification on what exactly started the war. My idea is that a territorial dispute between Colonial American Greenland and Viking Greenland resulted in a cold war of sorts. When the Celts allied with the Americans early on and sent troops to protect the American colony, the Vikings saw this as an act of war and quickly declared war on America on June 2, 2291. After a few years of hapless fighting, the Celts broke their alliance with the Americans, and decided to fight against them and the Vikings. At the five-year mark, nukes were soon put into use against all the different powers. As the decades passed on, the war eventually turned not into a war of territory, but to a war of revenge, retribution, and national respect.",,False,,t5_2ua25,1339725641.0,,NewVikingland,True,t3_v0npf,http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/v0npf/if_i_were_to_write_a_20page_short_story_about_the/,

The Celtic propaganda machine was a strong thing, but even it could not hide the truth that lay in front of me -- They were not the good guys.  They attempted to paint themselves as the underdogs, but the Celts had the most cities on the planet, the highest population on the planet, and the strongest military on the planet with the largest nuclear arsenal.  It seemed to me that they could end the war with one historic push, but after 1700 years of war, there was no end in sight.

I asked myself why.  They claimed that they wanted to be a free democracy that valued human life and honor, but the Celts, in their leaders own words, declared that such a thing would get in the way of their never ending war.  It seemed to me that they wanted the war to continue just for the sake of staying in power and keeping it all going.  Too much had been invested at this point to simply produce the effort necessary to win.

I had considered leading that nation to greatness until I knew the truth.  What I did instead was take a good hard look around the world.  I found a tiny island with barely 110,000 people that called themselves the Sioux.  Amidst the corrupt dictatorships and never ending warfare, here was a free republic that was driven from their homeland, yet refused to give up their system of government or their way of life.  They were at peace with not one, but two of the worlds superpowers.  Who was the only nation they were at war with?  That's right, the warmongering Celts, the same people who wouldn't even acknowledge that the Sioux exist.

So I offered them my help, and they accepted me as their leader.  Meanwhile, the Celtic people lost their own leader in totally unrelated events.  

The first few years were rough.  Farmland was impossible to obtain due to nuclear winter and encroachment of swampland.  The focus was to build harbors and ramp up food production from the sea.  Since we would be using the sea, oil refineries were also built in mass to ramp up production.  A proper capital was established at Raging Brook.

I also made it my priority to back my words with nuclear weapons.  The other nations of the world would be a lot more hesitant to attack someone with nuclear capabilities.  

For ten years I built up my infrastructure while the other three nations fought.  They lobbed nuclear weapons at each other seemingly without regard.  In 4001, however, the Americans managed to capture the Celtic capital.  This led to something unexpected -- their government fell and the Celtic empire split in two.  The loyal Celts, and the new English Empire.

I didn't pay much attention to this.  I kept building up my infrastructure and decided that it was time to build a new city.

But, uh, apparently that crashes the game.  After downloading a patch that makes Civ 2 work on 64 bit systems, I continued building the glorious Sioux empire!

By 4041, it seemed that the Celtic empire was about to draw its final breath.  I think that they just lacked proper leadership in the past few decades.

In 4060, the American empire had won.  The Celtic empire was no more.

In 4088 the English Empire which emerged from the Celts had also been defeated by the Viking war machine.

I've neglected to mention that I've been at war with America for a while at this point.  They kept sending around 3 - 4 ships and 1 - 2 planes at Point of Rocks every turn, but that city had great defenses in place.

Sometime around the year 4,100 I had achieved a huge milestone --  More than 1 million people called my nation home, which is impressive considering that we were a mere 100,000 strong 100 years prior.

http://i.imgur.com/khtNX.png


In 4,105 I decided to relocate the entire population of Miletos.  They could barely produce enough food to support themselves in their original location, and their growth potential was non-existent.  Everyone was moved closer to the ocean where they'd be able to fish for food.

I'm not sure when it happened, but the Vikings and Americans are finally at peace.  This seems to prove my theory that the Celts were not nearly as innocent as they'd have liked us to believe.  I am not naive, however, and I realize that the Vikings and Americans both remain a threat to the continued existence of the Sioux nation. 

Originally started as a defense force to stop any incursion onto Sioux land, our military has grown quite powerful.  Averaging nearly 11 years of service per citizen, the Sioux nation also has the longest period of enlistment on Earth.  We don't fuck around when it comes to our nations security.

http://i.imgur.com/badJF.png


Almost all of recorded history is lost to us, but I do know one thing -- The island that we're living on is not our native home.  The Sioux people originated from the lands to the south of us, and there has been a growing call to arms to get back what was taken from us.  Luckily, the Sioux military have been devising just such a plan...

The Sioux military attempts to get a beachhead on the continent to the south, but the Americans quickly bomb that into dust.  Another attempt is made, this time with a bigger military backing and in a more defensible position.  The attempt is successful.

http://i.imgur.com/REG0E.png


The Americans, perhaps seeing us moving our now massive army onto the continent, decide to sue for peace.  We accept.

But the senate puts a stop to that.

Which is why it is with a heavy heart that the military is forced to temporarily implement martial law and attack anyway.  The government collapses in scandal.

But the war effort goes well.  In 4292 the majority of the continent is under Sioux control.

And one year later the entire continent is under our control.  There were a few casualties, Athens and somewhere else got nuked, but so far it is a very successful war.

The Sioux population has almost tripled, but more than 500,000 people have died in the one year of fighting.

It was decided a large stimulus package would be given to the oil and fisheries industries to build many new habours and offshore platforms, the entire government surplus actually. The world's last remaining resource would be ruthlessly plundered, oil barons would become rich and several kinds of mutant fish would become extinct, but there would be new growth and this was good. It was also decided that the government would stick with Communism and that nuclear weapons would no longer be used. Howitzers would now make up the main attacking force with supporting Mechanized Infantry. Lastly, the focus would be on the attack of the evil Vikings while maintaining an alliance with the devious Americans as long as possible.

Airports were now to be constructed for quick transportation to the Viking mainland, but in the interim, all available howitzers would rendezvous with transports at Edinborough to make their way over early. This gathering was proceeding well, but then the Vikings got wind and Edinborough was promptly nuked, all perished. So airlifting was decided as the way to go. Within a few short years, howitzers were happily arriving en masse at New Vikingland.

The assault began with the Viking capital, Pisa, quickly falling. The Vikings showed some strong resistance to begin with but soon were well on the back foot. Spies were also employed to turn the weaker Viking cities to the Celtic cause. They used the latest espionage technique of attempting to buy cities from several different directions as the price would vary by hundreds or even thousands sometimes. No one was quite sure why this actually worked, “maybe the city guards at different sides of the city could be bought for different amounts?” some said. (NB: This actually works in the game!). Of course, all bought troops would immediately be sent on suicide missions against their old compatriots, if they had turned once, wouldn’t they turn again just as easily?

The war progressed very well, but unfortunately, the city of Westness was destroyed causing the destruction of Michelangelo’s Chapel, Sun Tzu’s War Academy and most despairingly, The Cure for Cancer, never to be seen again. Fortunately, no one remembered who Michelangelo was, and although cancer was rife due to the massive levels of radiation everywhere, most people died of other causes long before succumbing to cancer. The Vikings soon began employing the tactic of using the United Nations to force peace treaties and cease fires, which of course were quickly broken. And soon the inconvenience was removed once Jarlshof was captured and the United Nations disbanded. Some said that the war was won and these treaties should be adhered to, but luckily they soon ‘conscripted’ and headed off to the front lines to never be heard from again.

The Americans must have been getting wary at this point as they soon made an outrageous demand for cash which was readily rejected, and sure enough, next turn, war was declared opening a second front up. They started by unleashing their formidable air force of stealth bombers, but the defences held. The Americans and Vikings then formed an alliance and signed the ‘Verona pact’ to contain the so called ‘Celtic aggression’, when they knew the Celts were simply defending themselves. Soon, the Vikings had capitulated, so much so that the final Viking city was bought by a spy for a mere 35 gold, a fitting end to a once dominant force.

The American war was progressing well, with a slight set back when they decided to nuke their own city San Francisco, which was being used a Celtic forward base at the time with numerous troops stationed there. This callous act, devastating their own civilian population, further justified the Celtic mantra of no mercy. So the howitzers rained down destruction upon American cities indiscriminately and they were soon finished, in the year 4043, 52 years from when the council first met.

The war was finally over. Huge celebrations were held in the radioactive swamps all across the land. The war had continued so long, with so much radiation that the Vikings and Americans had virtually evolved into different species, so some were kept in various zoos, since most other zoo worthy animals had long since perished. During the war the polar icecaps had melted a further three times, but remarkably, since the remaining ice was actually below sea level, the sea level receded causing further celebration. But next was time for the clean up, swamps were drained, pollution removed from the land and dumped into the sea and people saw farmland for the first time in centuries. Mass building of new cities began to contain the large numbers of mutant barbarians that were uprising across the land and all was well.

The New Era began in 3991 AD, 200 years ago. Life was very different back then. Most of the world was radioactive swamps, and we had been at war with America and the Vikings for thousands of years. Comrade Lycerius had been leading us for ever, and we were Communists. 

It all changed when the Druid took over, and instead of Communism, we switched to a much better type of government called Fundamentalism. Fundamentalism is better than everything except Democracy, which is what we've got now. The Druid explained that we would have a few decades of sacrifice and hardship, but after that, everything would be much better. He then launched an all-out assault on the Vikings.

Every family has stories of those days. My great-great-grandmother sneaked into Roskilde and managed to sabotage a nuclear missile just before it was launched at our troops. My friend Deirdre's great-great-grandfather spent years with his tank battalion outside Giza, fighting off every attack that was launched against him, and by his sacrifice won time for our spies to capture the United Nations in Jarlshof.

Finally, the end came in 4012 AD - 21 years of hard fighting later. Our howitzers took the Viking capital of Pisa. Without a capital, the Vikings were disheartened, and our spies were able to convince their remaining cities to join our side. Sydney was the last Viking city, and they come over to us peacefully as soon as it was explained to them how superior the Celtic way of life is. For the first time in millenia, we were at peace.

The Viking cities had many luxuries - granaries, libraries, universities, police stations, cathedrals - that we sold off to help pay the pensions of our war veterans. I wonder what they were like? We don't have buildings like that nowadays: there's no point, since the Druid tells us that there's nothing new to learn.

There were only four years of peace, before fighting with the Americans began again in 4016 AD. We had sent an emissary to the Americans, requesting reparations for the centuries of war they had waged against us. The Americans presented us with a gift of a mere 75 gold. This insulting offer was effectively a declaration of war!

Fortunately, in the brief years of peace, we had been able to build a force of howitzers, bombers and spies, which were conveniently sited near the American cities. When the treacherous Americans effectively stabbed us in the back, we were ready to retaliate.

We took Izumo, Athens and Wounded Knee quickly, but we knew that the main fight would be on the American mainland. Our forces were airlifted across to the mainland, and we sent transports full of howitzers across from New Vikingland. We also sent our battleships to attack the Sioux, but due to a navigation error they went in the wrong direction for several years.

In 4020, we captured San Francisco, which was then the capital of America (it had moved from Washington a few years before).  In 4021, the Americans nuked San Francisco, destroying their own people! This shows how untrustworthy the Americans are. We call our soldiers who died that day the San Francisco Martyrs - they were the last people to be killed by nuclear weapons. We could have retaliated with our own nukes, but that would have been wrong.

In 4022, our battleships finally reached the Sioux cities of Point of Rocks and Raging Brook, and supported by howitzers from Dead Buffalo, they defeated the Sioux. Simultaneously, our forces landed at Atlanta to take out the remaining American cities. The Sioux and the Americans begged us for peace, and we granted it. The war was over.

The Druid stepped down from power in 4024 AD, and a new age of freedom, peace and Democracy began. Naturally, everyone voted for the Druid's party, and they've remained in power ever since. It took almost forty years to clean up all of the radiation from the nukes, but we finally did it in 4061 AD, and since then our engineers have been converting the swamps to farmland, and planting trees. There used to be problems with something called Global Warming, but that's gone away since the pollution was cleared up.

The Americans and Sioux are still around, of course. The Sioux have a city called Miletos, in the middle of the swamps, and the Americans are on a little swampy island in a tiny city called Crete. I went there on a school trip to look at them, once. I don't know why they want to live in such nasty places - Celtania is much nicer. 

There were less than 16 million people in Celtania at the beginning of the New Era, and there are 160 million of us now. Everyone's much happier, too. We celebrate ""We love the Druid day"" every year. I made a papier-mâché model of the Druid last year, and it won a prize. 

The Celts are the best civilization ever!

tl;dr Vikings beaten after 21 years, Americans and Sioux beaten after 31 years, pollution cleaned up after 70 years.After 200 years, 160 million people in Celtania and everyone happy.

The sky was grey and the floor was covered in the usual ash. It was hard to make out what month it was. The wind was cold and Drest hardly could stand it. He'd much rather be inside of his hab unit, but at least he was luckier than the men on their knees before him. American spies, his officer told him. In reality, they were workers. Workers caught stealing.

He peered at the men through his gas mask. Reaching into his heavy duster, he took a deep breath and lit a flare, throwing it in the center of the group. There wasn't a word said between the two parties. He knew what he was told to do and they knew what was bound to happen. 

He loaded a clip into his rifle and took a deep breath, resting the stock of the old gun against his shoulder. ""Le do thoil, ach a insint dom áit a bhfuair tú é."" He asked, a quiet, pleading tone in his voice. Silence. He let out a sharp exhale, his mask turning it into a low howl. 

A comrade approached from his left. ""Níl aon phointe i ag caint leo. Just a dhéanamh air."" His teammate offered him a sharp stare, green eyes focusing through faded gas-mask lenses. 

Drest gave a hesitant nod.

**""Archaeology.""**


A group of Civil Workers marched down a dusty, abandoned city street. It was one of those bright, energetic days where the sun almost came through the clouds and the wind wasn't as bitter. 
Sure, the buildings were old and mostly rubble, bombed nearly thirty times in the past millennium, but Fate was kind to the bold. 

One of the workers wandered into an old, roofless building with a collapsed wall. A mummified skeleton sat under a collapsed pillar. Lucky- It looks like this place was ignored or missed by other scavenge raids. Cadyrne knelt down and went through the rags that once made up the man's clothing. A watch- A pocket watch.

The man's eyes lit up with shock. Gold, with brass etchings. ""To my beloved James."" He read with some difficulty. He slowly stood up, cackling with glee. He tried his best to remember, but the only thing even remotely as shiny as this was one of the buildings he saw in passing in Cardiff as a child.

""Faigh rud éigin?"" A colleague yelled out, alerted by the noise. The scavenger cleared his throat and stuffed the watch into his jacket. ""Gan aon, Ní dhéanfaidh aon ní ach cnámha."" He turned. There was a man at the doorway, wearing a tight black jacket and holding a knife.
The patches on his jacket sleeves signified an American military unit.

The scavenger didn't have time to scream. Stabbed in the chest and thrown to the ground, only to be stabbed multiple times in a follow through. The other Americans wandered past in silence.

The forces had to move in under the brief bout of good weather. Tanks were on the way, blazing through bone-strewn remnants of a city lost to time and the war. It was six days to Cardiff, if they were lucky.

Armored warfare was useless. After losing several tanks in the first turn I realized that was a dead end. Jets and bombers were equally useless against quadruple Aeriel defense (SDI + SAM) in virtually all cities. So I decided to try a different angle: to buy my way in. 
Somehow, the starting treasury was about .5000 gold, which was enough to get me started. I first bought up the entirety of the Sioux continent, in about two turns. Didn't cont that much, neither. 
The Vikings proved to be more of a challenge. The great thing about buying cities is that you often gain control of sizable numbers of enemy troops. I quickly learned it was best to simply fortify these troops and wait until taxes raised enough money to buy more cities. From here on out it was like a game of monopoly, buying the smaller towns first, and then poisoning the water supplies of larger cities in order to make them smaller and thus more affordable. It took about a turn or two to raise enough money to buy the larger cities, but I had soon created a momentum the Vikings were not going to come back from. 
Once the Vikings were all bought out, it was now time to deal with the Americans. Our alliance had ended, but I decided I would keep the peace religiously. That was because by this time (after 40-50 years of my war with the vikings) they had amassed roughly 430 units: an army I could never defeat in open combat. 
So I kept the peace: and instead again went on a shopping spree, this time subverting cities instead of inciting revolt which costs twice as much but keeps the peace. By now I had become quite adept at raising money: revenue came from several streams: raising taxes at the expense of research, selling costly and unnecessary improvements, and then and building and selling improvements for cash. By the end of the game I had sold off everything that was not essential for making more money, including missile and nuke defenses: no use in preparing for a war that isn't going to happen. The more cities I bought, the more taxes I could raise, the more improvements I could sell, and the less maintenance I would pay. Life under Celtic communism was grim: all work and no play for both me and my citizens. But we had peace, we had security, and we we're winning the game. 
Slowly but surely I had driven the Americans from our lands, and now set my sights on their final ten cities, including their capital which I could not subvert. However, as these were all large cities and close to their capital, This meant they were prohibitively expensive, costing upwards of 10000 gold to incite, and double that to subvert. It would take me ten turns per city, at least. 
This is when I just said fuck it and nuked the remaining cities using spies. I nuked all remaining cities in one turn, conquered them and then had a nice long think about where my life is going. 

TL;DR I bought up all enemy cities in about 100 years.

So today my friend was messing around with darkrp configs and we were playing together, it was pretty fun, and suddenly I had a great idea, why not make a Eternal War RP server. I know lua, and I am really good at any scripting languages, however, I am un-experienced with Garry's Mod modding so I would like assistance by at least one person, and for it to be complete, we will need a mapper and server host. Here is a list of people that are required for this.

At least 1 fellow programmer, who is familiar with garry's mod gamemode modding and such to work with me.

We may need a modeller and a programmer familiar with weapons modding in garry's mod, as I would assume we would need future tech weapons. The modeller will also need to create player models.

At least 1 mapper, t(he)y will work probably only together, with communication with everyone else for conepts. The map will have to be scaled down of course, as garrysmod does not have very large map support, the map should only contain a few key cities, as well as the central disputed zone.

Server host: I can currently host a debugging server, not 24/7 but ports forwarded etc, but eventually we might want to have a 24/7 server that anyone can play in.

Maybe Garry's Mod isn't the right game, but imo, its a very accessable, inexpensive game, with a lot of support for modding, and to be fun it only requires a few people to play.

I would prefer you have a skype account, if not, however, we can use steam, to add me, my skype account name is drewlark99

I would also prefer that you have the Garry's mod 13 beta, however this is not required.

Anyway, I do have something unusual to say about my personal experience when I found out about Lycerius' 10 year old, Civ II game post... the whole Eternal War scenario caught my attention because I think that my own Civ III session (which I have been playing for 6 years so far) is probably on the brink of that.

Let me explain: I'm not a big Civ player (I kind of suck if I ever try a hard difficulty level), the first ever Civ game I owned and played was Civilization III's first expansion: ""Civilization III: Play the World"". Its the only Civ game I have except for Civ 4 that I just played for a while but never for a longer session than what it takes to win the game, and I never got Civ 5. (Mostly because I can't afford it and my computer is kind of old, and also because, as I said, I'm not that big a Civ player.)
I started a game in Civ III Play the World in 2007 (6 years ago) and I never actually ended it, wanting to see how far I could go... sort of what happened to Lycerius but not for that long (he played for 4 more years than I have)

I also play on and off, just a couple of hours each week, mostly on weekends. My game is on the 2400s now, and I'm afraid that I am living a ""Tense Peace"" Cold War kind of game, and I'm sure a global war is in the next corner, most likely this century or the beggining of the next one a war will start. And after reading what happened to Lycerius, I'm afraid of what might happen if I keep playing.

Because, you see, before reading Lycerius post, I was actually going to start a war. But after reading about The Eternal War on Civ II, I didn't start the war, and decided to see how long I could keep the peaceful world going, in other words stay AWAY from starting a war that would last for centuries. And now I realize that I can't, at least I don't see a good way to do so.

The game went like this (there were two major wars so far, and as I said, we have a ""Tense Peace"" now.) -

The map is one big continent west and east, joined together by a small, very small (one unit wide) land bridge, which I used to control but lost that on the last war, about 500 years ago. There were originally 5 civs (counting me) now there are only 4. It was me, using Carthage, then there were the computer controlled Koreans, Mongols, Spanish and Celts. The Celts were the only ones to be wiped out (I know, the irony).

The Celts were the only big nation in the same continent I started in (the west) I controlled the south and they the north. I basically wiped them out during the start of the Industrial age, and now all that remains of them is the cities names in the Northside of the West of the Continent. The Koreans, Mongols and Spanish had been controlling the East, and have about the same amount of land there each one, with some edge over the Koreans. There are two smaller continents, kind of like big islands would be more accurate, I control one that is next to the south side of the West continental side, and the Koreans controlled the other one completely (until the last war, which I'm getting to).

Before Nukes were developed, I wanted to expand my territory more so I started a war with the Koreans, which ended up as a big mess, the first global war my session had seen (the one with the Celts only involved me and them).

I had an alliance with the Mongols, but The Koreans had one with the Spanish. It was a First World War, like I said. There were no Nukes yet, so it was all involving tanks and planes and boats. I wiped out the Spanish and Korean Navies, and landed some troops on their shores south of the east side of the continent, and on the island that I did not control (controlled by the Koreans). Then moved some troops through the land bridge which was then under my control.
The war did not end well, it lasted centuries (about 300 years) and the result was very little land gained by all involved. The Koreans lost one city in the island by me, and the Spanish lost another two on the South region of the East side of the continent (where my invasion started), I lost the control over the small bridge of land.

Also, during the war the Mongols stopped their alliance with me by signing peace with both the Spanish and the Koreans, and then they declared war on me because they became their allies as well. (I guess they weren't very happy that I dragged them into a pointless war with the two countries that they had borders with)

The remains of my navy were able to stop them, but they still had control of the north sea when the war was at its peak, so I couldn't land troops there. So, I was unable to land troops on their land, and they managed to capture the one city I took from the Koreans on the island to the west since I couldn't get reinforcements in time (my transports were toast by then), so that Island is now controlled entirely y the Koreans except for that one single Mongol controlled city.

My two cities on the South side of the East continent remained my only land gained, and the lost of control over that key piece of land that is the land bridge was my only land lost during the war. So a 300 year old war ended in just a stalemate, with little to none land gained by all sides involved.

When mine and the other Civ's troops were spread too thin (plus I had riots in my cities and once in a while production was halted because of Anarchy from the fall of the government order), I was finally in a position to make a peace treaty with all the other nations. But the war had its consequences, maybe not land wise, but it was devastating politically.

I decided to just keep developing until there was nothing else to discover or develop, and when nukes were discovered, I started to stockpile them (because I wanted to make another war when I was strong again). And so we come to my game at the present time (2400s), and me trying to keep the peace for as long as possible after learning of Lycerius 1700 year old war.

My civ, Carthage, is stable. I'm a democracy, parades and special days are celebrated all over, all cities are developed and have a high population.

But the other three remaining nations (Koreans, Mongols and Spanish) hate me to the bones, I know they would wipe me out if they considered they had a chance. But they don't have as many nukes as I do, plus I have the satellite to protect my cities from attacks, and they do not.

They really, REALLY, hate my guts, the Mongols, the Koreans and Spanish also all have defense treaties with each other that get renewed right as soon as they expire, so I know that if I attack just one of them, another world war will erupt. No matter what I try, they just hate me, regardless of how many gold I give them, how many maps we trade, or whatever we do, they keep distrusting me at best, and demanding payment every now and then at worse. And when I give them gold or resources on my own accord, they just accuse me of trying to bribe them.

I wasn't thinking much of it at first, but after reading  some other comments about the Eternal War (I mean, not the fiction and art, which was nice, but the whole ""Humane Thing To Do"" discussion, and YouTube videso and the like.) I now have my doubts of what is in my future. I don't think I can make the peace last. And its not just because of the hate of the other three nations.

You see, my population is happy and stable, but pollution starts on and off, regardless that I have only Solar Power plants and recycling centers in every city. Also there is famine, not because of war, but because my population is so big, that even by owning half of the world, I still don't have enough food resources to feed all of them (and I can't trade for food with the Koreans, Spanish or Mongols because, as I said, they hate me).

My economy, which was once stable, is now on the brink of collapse. I will most likely run out of money in 300 or 400 years from now. Even with over half of my cities producing Wealth, I still keep loosing more money.

I could have more money, and maybe food, if I destroyed all my nukes, tanks, battleships, submarines and everything else (well, not all, but a big chunk of them), but I'm sure that as soon as I do, I will become weak enough that the Mongol-Korean-Spanish alliance will attack me. I need those troops and nukes for deterrence (and I have plenty of them).

But I have to do something, or this Peace and happyness that Carthage is experiencing will end. 
If my super big population does not start dying from famine all over, then I will need to do something about my economy which is on the brink of collapse.

I know a war against the other three civs will give me the money and resources I need to keep my economy afloat and food storage full. But that would go against the point of me trying to keep the peace going. If I start a war now, it will last centuries, everyone is armed to the teeth, its a bomb waiting to explode. I'm actually afraid of the consequences now after reading this Eternal War thing.

Sure I have nukes, but by so do they, and while I have defense of my cities, I'm sure a war now would be devastating still.

At the same time, I don't see another way out of this but to start the war. I cannot produce enough Wealth for my nation to remain economically stable, and famine will just increase as my happy and stable population keeps growing more, and more and more.

Again, my game is at the 2400s, if I were to start a war now, it will have two results 1- it lasts for centuries and be devastating for everyone, or 2- The war does not last long because I wipe them out in one go, and now I'm in control of everything... devastated by a terrible nuclear war, after nuking my enemies 100 times... IF I start the war of course, which I'm trying NOT to, but again, I see no other way out.

And when I start the war, after a couple of years I'm sure to have Riots and political unrest from everyone against the war (like it happened the last time), and I won't be able to keep my production from the Anarchy, so its most likely that I would end my democracy, forcing me to go to a totalitarian form of rule, like Communism (most likely), just like it happened to Lycerius.

And then the front line will be stuck, since I control the seas but what good is that if I cannot do invasions fast enough to stop all three nations at once (they don't hate each other, so they don't fight each other, they hate ME).

After reading other people's comments, and a YouTube video about the Eternal War, I realized something: I'm the worst dictator ever and my civilization is the most evil people ever.

Sure, I have a Democracy, and so do the others, sure my people love me (for now). But my cities are full of tanks, bombers, marines and nukes. The sea under my control is filled with battleships and submarines (I don't like using carriers that much).

So this ""Peace"" is only because I have deterrent weapons. And the stability is just like a house made of cards: built on a diminishing economy and food supply.
The other nations of the world hate me, they must have radio shows and TV programs and such making me look like the biggest bastard ever... They will not start the war, I'm too powerful for them to risk it, I guess. But they hate my guts, and will continue to do so no matter what I do.

I'm at a crossroad, but my only way out seems to be a terrible and most likely long war with the Mongol-Spanish-Korean alliance... which will result in a complete devastation now that I see what happened to another player that played for longer than me.

I'm afraid of what will happen if I keep playing, and at the same time, I see no other solution to my position. I need money and food, and if I don't come up with something in the next 200 years or so, my economy will be bankrupt and my food supply will surely not be enough to feed my huge population, and then what Well, start the war anyways... only more desperate for money and resources than how I am now.

I'm posting this because I view my 6 year old game as a ""how the whole mess got started"" kind of thing, after reading the original Eternal War file game for Civilization 2 by Lycerius.

What I see in my game is this: If Lycerius' Eternal War game shows a stalemate of war, a world devastated by radiation, and so on, my game shows that it seems impossible to stop that if you are not the only nation in the whole world.

Peace cannot last because the economy will colapse, and if it does not colapse because I dismantle my army, then I'm defenseless against my enemies (enemies that I created because I started a war with them centuries ago.) And even if my economy were okay, I still would need the land of the whole world to keep famine from spreading to the billions of people that live in my nation.
Is that what happens? Is the Eternal War inevitable no matter what we try to do? Can Peace only be mantained if I kill and destroy my enemies? Is Carthage's only means of survival to kill the Koreans, Spanish and Mongols? Is the economy impossible to mantain in a world where war is a possibility, and moreso, a certainty? Is the world condemned to suffer hunger and thirst because no matter how stable, and developed a country is, the populance will grow still, and the world just cannot produce enough resources to feed them, even if we have farms and crops in every piece of land available for farming? Can I feed an ever growing population for a billion people in a world that, even at maximum production and farming, can only feed a million people? Is the Eternal War possible to stop? Or is the only possible future outcome?


EDIT:
For the person that asked for screenshots, and the one that asked for the save file:

Screenshots: http://imgur.com/a/S4LOJ

For the save file, I uploaded it on FileFactory, and on Mediafire. The file is, again, for Civ III: Play the World. Also, I have a Spanish version of Civ III (I live in South America) so this is a file used with the European version of the game. I'm not sure if it would work in the USA version of the game. Does it?

Like half the planet, I was the news coverage of The Eternal War and fell in love. I've played Civ in multiple versions for years, and the idea of a game that went on that long was both hilarious and captivating. But when Lycerius made the savegame available for everybody to play, and everyone DID, basically it was the most awesome thing ever. One of my favorite things was the number of people who took on the role of the beleaguered Sioux nation, attempting to bring them back from the brink of destruction. 

So while I loved and lurked before, I'm actually coming out of the shadows because I just found out something in real-life that's shitty and disturbing. It turns out that in two days, land holy to the actual Sioux people is going up for auction. They call it Pe'Sla, and it's to the Sioux culture what Jerusalem is to the Middle East.

The land was originally belonged to the Sioux, not only because they lived on it long before anyone else got there, but specifically because they signed a treaty with the U.S. Government in which the government explicitly stated the land was theirs. 

Until gold was found on it. 

Then the land was taken by force. And now, generations later, the people who own the land are putting it up for sale. Although the land was assessed at about $350,000 value, developers are planning on driving the price of the sale up into the millions. 

They want to put in a golf course. And a highway. 

Even though they're massively outgunned, the Sioux nations are working together an unprecedented fundraising effort to try to get the money they need to buy it back.

I saw this, and I thought of you all. If ever there was a perfect analogy between a game and real life, this is it. 

Here is their donation page:
http://www.indiegogo.com/PeSla-LakotaHeartland?c=activity

Here is petition to the governor of South Dakota to delay the sale to give them time to collect more money:

On the other hand, some commenters asked for me to make a copy of the save file, and start the war to see what would happen.
Since I was on my way of starting the war before I ever found out about the Eternal War scenario, I did just that. I'll be posting here a year by year war journal of every movement and such things, and let's see how long will last. I won't make new posts on this (unless the post is so long that reedit requires that I do create a new post). I'll be posting pictures as well as the situation progresses.

2519 AD: The War starts. I use about two thirds of my nukes, deciding to leave some for the later part of the war just in case. About 1 out of 4 of the nukes I launch hit the target thanks to the satellite defenses of the other civs. The Koreans, being the closest to me, are the ones that get striked the most. I also nuke the island, but not as much as the mainland. After the devastation of the Koreans, I attack the Spanish and Mongols. The Mongols are the ones thatg get destroyed the less of the bunch. After the nuclear strike ends, I take Gergovia and raze it, then move my troops on the land bridge that connects both sides of the continent.
The counterattack: The Mongols move their fleet and attack mine on the north, I sink all the ships that came to me (not as many as I expected, just 6. I loose 4 ships myself, 3 of them submarines and one Battleship). The Spanish on their part attack my fleet on the south, they sink one carrier but otherwise they are destroyed. The Koreans move what is left of their army and start attacking me, I loose some of my tanks, but I keep them at bay. Their nuclear counterattack is constant, but I have satellite defense. Of all the nukes they throw, only 4 of them hit, my capital stays untouched.
All in all, considering the amount of people that had lived on those cities and the ones that remain after the strike, I'll say that about 100 million people died in that first strike alone.
Every inch of land on the Western continent is now a warrent radioactive wasteland, every piece of infrastructure is destroyed.

2520 AD: I Build Gergovia Novo, to replace Gergovia, right on the bridge of land, this will work as a fort for my invasion and as a ""Panama Canal"" for my ships to have easy access to the north sea from the south. I move my land troops, I loose some but the Koreans loose more. I take Seoul and keep it. The Mongols make more incursions on my north sea, I keep them at bay but loose two more ships. The Spanish remain out of my sea space, but move towards my two cities on the southern side of the Eastern contienet. I repell their attack, and I move my troops to take Cheju, Ulsan and Namp'o. The Korean army is now virtually gone from the mainland and so is most of their fleet close to my land, they go into their cities and stay there fortified. Global warming us starting after so many nukes blowing up at once.

2521 AD: I did not expect this! The Mongols betray the Koreans and declare war on them, They take Wonsan and are now moving towards Pyongyang and Ulsan as well. They are still at war with me, so they move towards Seoul. I take Cheju, Ulsan and Namp'o with ground attacks, I fortify them with several tanks. The Spanish move towards Tingis. The Spanish declare war on the Mongols, since they had a mutual protection treaty with the Koreans.  All the cities that were or are in Korean hands are now just a bunch of rubble, filled with the survivors of the nuclear attacks, and those are suffering from famine. It'll take a while to rebuild once the war ends... if it ever ends that is.

2522 AD: The Political unrest started on many of my cities, stopping production in most of them. It seems that my people are against the war (as I expected them to be). I'm sure the government will end soon and I'll be under Anarchy. I bid my time and fortify more cities that were taken before, I don't have as many troops as I wanted by now, but I do it anyway. The Mongols attack fully, I'm unable to repell them, they take Ulsan and Seoul from me, they are moving towards Gergovia Novo and also Pusan. The Spansih take Tingis from me.

2523 AD: The battle on the seas rage on. The Koreans are gone from the mainland, but their fleet still can do some damage. They attack me on three flanks: the southern island, the west side of my mainland and the ships on the south of the west continent. I loose several ships but I'm able to sink everything that comes my way from them. The Spanish don't take anything and I repell their attacks. (By now I'm using some of my remaining nukes against advancing troops, that just keep comming wave after wave, some nukes get past the satellite defenses and it helps a lot). The Mongols also strike from the north sea. I use my remaining ships there and sink them, but not before they are able to sink my two transport ships, there goes my plan to invade the island. I nuke the island some more to keep them low, but its mostly out of frustration from loosing the transports.

2524 AD: My government falls into Anarchy. This is bad, since my army has been loosing its momentum after the war started. Turns out that having most of your plan be a nuclear strike and then move ground troops, when your enemies outnumber you in that aspect 5 to 1 is not very good. With the Anarchy comes a complete halt in production, I cannot make more units until order is restored. I think I'll choose Communism once that happens, otherwise this scenario will repeat itself again and again, and I'll start loosing ground. The Mongols take Pusan, but fail to take Gergovia Novo, I retake Ulsan from them. The Spanish move towards Pusan.

2525 AD: The Mongols are repelled completely from Gergovia Novo. I take the opportunity and retake both Seoul and Ulsan. I fortity them as much as I can, and I keep my troops there. I will not advance until I can be secure that I can produce more troops. I see now another weakness in my strategy as well: While the enemy will need to take Gergovia Novo in order to invade my mainland, my reinforcements can only come from Gergovia Novo as well. I have no transports so there is no other way. The Spanish take Pusan from the Mongols. The Mongols take Pyongyang (last city held by the Koreans, didn't take that long for them), but fail to retake any of the other cities I took before. Sea attacks seem to have ceased now, I remain on the defensive there as well.

2526 AD: Reinforcements of the Mongols come towards Seoul, but stay away from the other two cities (Namp'o and Ulsan) They surround Seoul, but by now some of the troops are actually cavalry. They don't attack yet (they are not in range so most likely will be the next turn.) The Spanish stay put as far as I can see, except to fortify Tingis (maybe they are fighting the Mongols on their border nowm, or are planning to take Malaca, I'll wait and see.) 

2527 AD: Still in Anarchy, but economyh is good. Once production resumes I'll be able to make more troops, I just hope its soon. Also on the downside, the riots in the cities are getting worse, and some of my infrastructure there (like banks and such) are getting destroyed by angry mobs. Nuclear winter is starting, and the north side and south side of the continent gets covered in thundra. I use one more of my remaining nukes to attack the approaching Mongol troops, but fails because of the satellite defense. The Mongols attack Ulsan but not Seoul, but are kept at bay. The Spanish move, they don't take Malaca, but do attack Cheju and take it from me. Now they move towards Malaca.

For this I had prepared 400 spies, but then from time to time the unit limit would be reached, and since I didn't want to constrict the other civilizations in building units (I thought that to be unrealistic), I loaded a year before and disbanded a couple of spies when that happened, so only about half of those remain. 


**The keys to peace**

The most important things I learned in this game were:
*1) To live in peace you need the UN.
*2) If an attack should come, have defendable borders, so avoid situations like in the former Japanese, Greek and Sioux territories (at Izumo, Athen, Killdeer etc.) where you have a mixture of your own and enemy cities. So either take the enemy cities or give up a few of your own. I took option one, but option two might make the nations more evenly matched and the game more interesting.
*3) Spies sabotaging cities work great if you don't want to take their cities away, but don't want them to produce units, either.
*4) Nuclear Weapons are indeed a deterrent. I tried once to disband the nuclear missiles, and two turns later the Sioux, then the Americans attacked me. A few turns later they had enough though since I had opened the borders and now the Vikings were attacking them. But since peace was my goal, I'd rather keep the nukes and the forced peace.
*5) If you want to drain the swamps you need A LOT of time. In the turns when I had the most engineers, one turn would take two and a half hours, easy. And that's not just one turn, but 70 or more. Although in these 2.5 hours the buying of city improvements is already included, so if you have fewer cities, either because you took less enemy cities or founded less new ones of your own, this is faster and you would need less turns to drain the swamps on your territory.   


**What's the sitch?**

So far the Vikings have been content to attack the other nations with their navy, land ground units on my shores and occupy the space between my cities or fly choppers and bombers over my land to attack the Americans and Sioux, like this:

[an example of Viking incursions](http://imgur.com/EG07N)

Luckily (and to my great surprise and amusement) they tried out a Democracy for a short while in 4296 and they disbanded or retreated most of their units from my territory, the rest I could bribe away. 
Now how did I get here? Well my goal was something like this, the techs researched, the cities on capitalization, the other nations still alive and coexisting peacefully. 
But I guess without the United Nations the Vikings aren't that good at peace, they kept on fighting with the Americans and Sioux. Once I contained the Vikings, the Americans and Sioux continued, so I enforced that border too, at least the seaway. The air units I mostly bribe away, since the money is capped at something around 70,000 Gold. 
For me however the United Nations were the one thing that allowed me to make peace, and I think they play a great role in keeping the peace too, at least the AI keeps telling me so... 


**The way so far**

As fas as general strategy goes, mine was pretty boring :) Build and buy Harbors, Offshore platforms (seriously, don't waste the oceans...), baracks, defenses, markets etc.,  but no more offensive units. A few Mechs, maybe a Stealth Fighter, but that's it. Concentrate on defending the Viking chokepoints, incite a revolt in Birka (Adam Smith's Trading Company is a great help in the beginning) and the other towns on that continent. It was beneficial here to bring a few mechs along to defend my new towns, but since your transport can't bring them there, they have to move through enemy territory which is a problem due to the enemie's zones of control. But since spies ignore zones of control and a unit can always enter a field where another friendly unit is already present, if there is a way, they'll reach their goal. This takes a bit of time, but it's time well spent. 

[moving through enemy territory](http://imgur.com/vSY3M)

Then I got the towns around Athen and Killdeer, either by force or via spies. After that I cleaned up all the pollutions, and since I didn't use Nuclear Missiles or spies to plant nukes and my towns all had SDI defenses, new pollutions were very rare. Once the pollutions were cleared up I started draining the swamps. 
Since in a democracy a city which is celebrating the ""We love the President Day"" grows as long as there's food around, there's no way around a democracy if you want to grow new cities and keep old cities at the same size while building engineers. 
So I  changed to a Democracy (the year you start the revolution should be dividable by 4, then you get the new government the next turn in this game) and started producing engineers, one per city. This often meant a few years of food shortage, but since I build harbors and a supermarket, the cities survived without a famine.
These engineers drained the city-square first, then the town built another engineer, another square drained, another engineer and so forth. Parallel I incited a revolt in Jarlshof and the towns westward of it and expanded with new cities, since it would be a shame to let all these special resources go to waste. This also took care of the Celtic Independents, since upristings never start in a city radius. 


**Reclaiming the planet**

To drain the swamps, I usually used one engineer to build a road, if necessary, and then sent two engineers to work. One can use more engineers per square, but it's less clicking and button pressing this way. 
For terraforming mountains, Glaciers and Tundra, I used packs of nine engineers, eight would stay in place (the laser) and charge the ninth one up, the next turn the ninth one (the beam) would go to whatever needed to be terraformed and another engineer would take its place. This way a mountain can be turned into a Hill in two turn with three packs, aka 27 engineers and so on. How to charge up engineers, read this, it helped me a lot :)

[Infos about settlers and engineers](http://apolyton.net/showthread.php/20497-Info-Settlers-Engineers-%28GL%29)

For working in unfriendly territory, let stealth bombers give you air cover. For this you need two or three veteran bombers per worked square and a nearby town with an airport, since one is sometimes regenerating. This way only stealth fighters can attack you, one fighter usally looses and it's rare and only if the AI had time to build up units that they send more than one fighter. If you want to be really safe you can build a fortress first and send additional Mechs, but they aren't really necessary. (Related to this is the super stack, invented by Xin Yu, where you use one Mech, one or two bombers, four engineers and whatever offensive units you fancy. First you build the airbase, fly the bombers in, then you build a fortress. The next turn you destroy the fortress with the defensive unit, build the airbase, let the fighters tank, then you build the fortress again and so on. Add a spy to it and you can move through enemy territory with it.)

The beginnings of a script",131,14,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/xj9hp/ok_people_you_wanted_the_eternal_war_mini_series/,"Just as the title says, this is some of the work that has come out of the forum posted here a while ago. Just keeping you guys updated.

This piece was written by XL_Monkey_Turban, its about a Celtic politician. Hope you guys enjoy.

The distant sound of gunfire woke the Consul, his vision blurred in the aftermath of sleep. He lay in his bed for a minute, enjoying the peace of his room, savouring it, fearing the dreaded knock at his door. The Consul was a small man, roughly five foot six, his pale skin speckled with freckles and moles, his hair had fallen out at the age of 15 living next to a crater left centuries ago, a permanent scar on the land. Growing up on an irradiated algae farm, feeding the glorious Celtic army, he became a weak and frail child, death always at the door. When he came of age, the Consul was deemed unfit for military service for his weak body, instead being chosen for the Celtic political academy for his cunning and intelligence, where he was groomed and trained to Govern. He displayed two important traits of Governance: adaptability, and more importantly; unquestioning obedience.

Consul Brennus Koun still showed the scars of his childhood, prominently a cancerous growth above his right eyebrow that forced him into a permanent frown, his sunken eyes giving him a sinister and penetrating stare, as if he were plotting a dark scheme, fantasising about the chaos it would cause. Rolling out of his lavish bed, a concrete slab with a blue plastic sheet and a bundle of old clothes to act as a pillow, Brennus began to cough, a hacking noise that tore the back of his throat, spittle and blood gathering in a small pool as his convulsions slammed him onto his hands and knees, cold radiating from the pitted concrete floor and into his body. The coughing continued for around a minute, leaving him naked, shivering in a foetal position, the left side of his face in the soup of blood and saliva, the Consul lay there for some time, his breath rasping like sandpaper against the floor.

A polite knock at the steel bulkhead followed by a young child's voice. ""Message for Consul Brennus Koun.""
He tried to speak but his breath caught, resulting in a series of coughs. The child repeated the knocks. ""Message for Consul Brennus Koun.""
Brennus cleared his throat and managed in a horse rasp; ""Come in"" before breaking down into another, smaller group of coughs. The child managed to spin the rusty wheel on the outside of the door with a small grunt, the internal pneumatics sliding the door into the walls with a squeal and a hiss of steam, revealing a fair-haired boy that looked the age of 9, his face smeared with dirt and ash, his wode barely visible under the scum that caked his visible skin.

Upon seeing the broken form of the consul, the child gasped, looked away, and ran over to help him. ""Sir, are you hurt?"" The child glanced at the Consul before blushing and looking away again. Brennus couldn't help but chuckle. A weak smile graced his face and he beckoned the child to come closer, whispering hoarsely into his ear to fetch him his water by the basin opposite his bed. The basin was, like everything in the room, made of concrete, with a small shard of glass roughly 10cm long and narrowed to a dagger-like point acted as a mirror for the Consul, to remind him of his weakness each morning, and below it, an iron hand pump extended from the floor to a collection of dirty plastic water bottles on the basin's right hand side, all but one half full. On the opposing side of the basin, a cocktail of pills, needles and transparent bottles were arranged in neat, orderly rows, categorised alphabetically and in order of use. The child reached out to grab a water bottle with a grubby hand, stopping briefly to decide which was the cleanest, before leaning over the majority to take a empty one and pump it full. Once that was done he rushed over to Brennus, who had propped himself up against the side of his bed, passing him a bottle with only a small number of specks residing in crystalline water. Brennus wasted no time and downed half of the bottle, immediately clearing his throat and settling his stomach, twisting the cap back on, letting it roll out of his hand, the child returning it to the basin the moment it hit the floor.

Brennus spoke, his voice stronger now, more authoritative ""Pills."" His voice was that of a giant, commanding through fear. ""The white one's.""
The child fussed for a moment, searching for the right set. ""On the left, where your hand is."" A few seconds later, the child returned to him with a small plastic sheet with circular white pills inside, which he popped out one, tipping his head back, eye's closed, he threw it into his mouth, his head slamming forward onto his chest, eyes opened and pupil's dilating to the size of his iris, breathing heavily for 10 seconds before jumping to his feet, wide awake. Once again, the child averted his eyes at the sight of his starkness. The Consul chuckled again ""I was born like this, son, so were all of us""

Walking over to the basin, he tapped the inside of his left arm to bring up his veins, he stuck a hypodermic needle into them shivering at the relief it brought, standing straighter as he did. He swallowed a blue pill, accelerating his thinking to a post human level, and only then did he seem to notice his nakedness, walking over to a steel door on the opposite side of the room, opening it to reveal a sparse wardrobe, taking out a matte black pair of trousers, pulling them on quickly and efficiently, a dark green baggy shirt followed by a royal looking coat, black as marsh water with golden buttons leading up his left side to the bottom of his neck and the Celtic flag emblazoned in a crisp emerald green. His eyes were no longer sunken, he no longer coughed, no shadow of the carcass of the man that coughed up blood onto the floor remained. Last to go on was an ancient filtration mask, a compound fuel model, inserting a 1cm3 cube into the fuel box to last him a day, stalling the demise of his lungs.

The Consul glanced down at the child, his voice grandiose despite the muffling of the filter.
""Promise not to tell anyone?"" He had a slightly patronising tone, unnoticeable to someone of the child's age. The child nodded. Ruffling his hair, Brennus handed him water the two empty bottles, ""Go fill these up, son, make sure your family get some."" The child nodded, more eagerly this time, grabbing the two bottles and stuffing them into his belt and as he turned to go, Brennus grabbed the back of his shirt, and with a playful tone asked; ""And the message?"" The child handed over a dull metal message tube before running off, eager to return home with the bottles of clean water.

The Consul poked his head round his room's bulkhead to watch the young boy run off, sad that he might not live to adulthood, but hopeful for the good he may bring. Shoving that thought to somewhere it wouldn't bother him, the Consul screwed the cap off the foot long tube, tipping the paper out onto his hand. He lay the tube on his bed and unrolled the mysterious message. He sat down as he read the thin parchment, it was brief, but no less important for it.
The American city of Thebes has been annexed under the superior might of Celtania, you are chosen by our glorious Lord Lycerius to Govern the city and prevent foreign scum from desecrating it further. A helicopter escort will arrive at 0700 hours, from there the escort will take you to the Department of control's office in Thebes. Further orders will be given at a later date.

**EDIT 2: I will not be responding to any comments for a while for I am on vacation. Please do not be offended if your name does not show up on here or if it seems like I'm ignoring you. Promise, I'm not.**

Now, by no means is this going to be fast. We still need to get people in roles, produce things, decide on what game engine this will run on/game this will be a mod for, record, blah-de-blah.

However! I do believe we can do this! So, in this post, I'll be gathering everyone who wants to contribute's collective names and what they can contribute!

Now, this project won't be starting for a few weeks to give people some time to do important people things (Such as getting any potential writers to write storylines and anyone who may have vacations coming up soon to have their vacations) but it'll be useful to have people who are contributing all in one place.

So far, people who are contributing are...

* /u/Misterlolie (for things that aren't too hard)

this all started [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/uyswv/here_it_is/c4zw944) with me wondering how to first tackle the problem and what would be the best way to end the conflict, i started posting when i felt i had achieved the imposible, cripple the vikings.

But what were the decisions that led to that advance? I will expound on them here:

First you must realize that Civ 2 is a great game but within the confines of governments and the styles you can take it is really restrictive, every government follows a specific purpose and has a game winning effect on the game, using that correctly changes dramatically the end game. Let's start by discarding such methods of government that would be foolish to take, Lycerius, in his great wisdom has left the game as a communist state, this decision might seem weird to a lot of people, but here's why. You would all probably say that the best government is republic and/or democracy right? Wrong. Within civ 2 republic and democracy are based on an already matured civilization changing from an inferior political system to them, in effect they require the necessary infrastructure such as temples, marketplaces and especially a great irrigation system to work, they are the perfect governments for kingdoms to flourish into a scientific age. Nearing the fourth millenium all technology has been obtained and more importantly no such irrigation exists meaning that the huge cities required to mantain the expensive lifestyle of the republics or democracies do not exist. 

The remaining governments are as follow anarchy, despotism, communism, fundamentalism and monarchy. Anarchy is the base state when no taxes, or science can be made, some production occurs but under heavy corruption, discarded. Despotism and monarchy fail from the fact that they are extremely similar even if monarchy is a step up it kinda fails in scope and is not really, in my opinion, an endgame. Despotism is the lesser form of government highly corrupt, no support system for troops, etc. Both discarded.

This leaves the main contenders for this enthralling dystopia, communism and fundamentalism. While I give huge props to Lycerius for sticking to communism let me explain that it's a despotism on steroids, the thing that makes it worth it is that there is no corruption under communism, not any so it's cool, it has even a better approach at settlers in that as a heavy workforce they are still not expected to eat as much as their democratic counterparts making engineers only eat one food instead of 2. Because of the horrible effect global warming has had on the world food is extremely hard to come by and this makes communism extremely viable.

Finally we reach fundamentalism it has the specific advantage, that every city can mantain 10 units, this here is the thing that makes this government the one I chose, furthermore as you are planning the conquest of 2 huge nations it would be in the best of your advantage to have a system of government that makes sad people happy right? Under fundamentalism no unhappiness occurs. This is largely offset by the fact that all scientific progress is completely halved, a bad thing right? As you read before all possible tech has already been researched, so there is no actual downfall to this government. The only fly in the ointment is the settlers food intake that as republic and democracy cost 2 food. But it's a small price to pay for the best military in the world. This is the government I took.

Economically the country is fine due to a complete lack of science structures in the celtic country even the smaller cities produce more money than they consume. So by selling some unessential structures you can have enough money to buy a beachhead deep within viking territory, which is what you must first do, I disembarked my first spy on the viking cost and bought lindholm and then the inevitable victory occured by buying the rest of the cities.

It is extremely important to buy the cities even if you can take them militarily, why? Because you want to keep 2 structures that you always destroy in conquest, the SDI defense and the sam missile battery. The computer still has it's supply of nuclear weapons and will use it on you if you are unwary.

For the rest i will post my original response to Lycerius:

There was a period where I played Civ 2 as a banana republic dictator named Enrico PhearMe, a naming homage to the famed nuclear scientist [Enrico Fermi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi). Enrico (well, my Enrico, anyway) was a classic dictator in the mold of Sasha Baren Cohen's latest creation: brash, jovial, covered in medals he never earned, with an insatiable hunger for cocaine.

He had a grand palace in his capital - which was usually named Fear. This lead to the delightful naming conventions of wonders, my favorite of which was, naturally, The Colossus of Fear.

In one particular game, I came upon an isolated, Australia-sized continent, populated only by the French. Now, I've got plenty of... history with the French in Civ. They've always been a thorn in my side. But Enrico was magnanimous: he offered them peace, trade, and a couple of lines of his finest Colombian.

Initially, the French - prickly as they can be - accepted Enrico's offer of friendship. But a few turns later, these... primitives (we're talkin' muskets versus infantry and artillery) declared war on me for no reason that I can discern.

The scene in the president's office was idyllic: the bright, tropical sun shone in the broad windows, bathing Enrico's office in a warm light. The President For Life rose from his desk after receiving the first reports of combat, and walked purposefully to a hidden closet.

He carefully removed his general's outfit, hanging it with dignity. He then put on his robes, the ceremonial ones he used when it was time to remind the people of his divinity. (I switched to Fundamentalism, naturally.)

After he had put on the appropriate garb, he returned to his desk, and lifted it to reveal a giant lever: one one side, PEACE. The other, WAR.

He threw the switch.

Later, he invited in his harem of impossibly beautiful women, as well as the palace press corps for an impromptu address to the nation. Drinks were served to all, and giant plates of the finest blow were provided to maintain the festive atmosphere.

On the front page of the nation's biggest newspaper, a picture of a smiling Enrico, with a babe on each arm and a drink in his hand, was captioned with the screaming headline:

Here's what I have to say about it.,109,41,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/uzdt3/i_just_played_5_hours_of_the_eternal_war_heres/,"I streamed a ton of it. No cheating, here's the link to the ENTIRE VoD.
http://www.twitch.tv/s3xyl3xy/b/321264178

When I started out, I was a little overwhelmed. There a lot of rampant corruption, a pretty vast empire, a lot of gold, and the swamps issue to deal with. I looked at all the cities I had under control, and to be frank, Lycerius was in a VERY good position to destroy the Viking menace.

* 1. Don't feel overwhelmed.

Lycerius had a LOT of units set to sleep. Wake them up and get them geared towards the primary objective: Those rotten vikings. They've got a lot of howitzers, armor, and ICBMs, but frankly, once your battleships suck up all the damage from the ICBMs, you're in good shape to take down the vikings. They had a lot of stealth bombers too, but the fact that every major base has a SAM site, they're not an issue.

* 2. Every base needs a harbor

One problem that I had right off the bat was the CRIPPLING infrastructure in place. With every major landmass covered in swamp, your only option is the sea. Spending money toward harbors can turn your negative growth rate right around. Very few bases minus a few have this going for them, so get it right away. If you can manage a positive food supply, get engineers right away to fix the swampland encompassing the entire map.

* 3. Fundamentalism is the way.

The big thing that fixed everything was running a revolution IMMEDIATELY and switching to fundamentalism. No more corruption, no more riots, and a metric buttload of gold right off the bat. I spent it towards infrastructure (see above) and set my paths straight toward military.

* 4. Nukes? What nukes?

I did not get hit by a single nuke while I was rushing the sioux or the Vikings. I was hit by a lot of ICBMs, sure, but nothing I couldn't manage. After that, it was a very downhill battle where I was calling the shots and there was nothing left to fear from the voracious Viking army.

* 5. Alliance with the Americans.

BEST. DECISION. EVER. It was clear IMMEDIATELY as soon as I loaded the save that the Americans were the dominant army in the game. They had me surrounded with helis, howitzers, tanks, fundamentalists, and mech. This game would get a lot harder if that alliance didn't exist. Please treasure this agreement and after you take care of the vikings, you can basically do whatever you want.

* 6. Sioux? What Sioux?

That's right, there's a fourth faction: The sioux. They're on a tiny island and pose no threat whatsoever. Take care of them with 4 howitzers and you'll be in excellent shape to take on anything else you're going to deal with in this apocalypse of a world.

**TL;DR Thank God for America, Vikings aren't so tough, and neither are the Sioux**

This time however I have all the resources and knowledge required, and I have already begun the development of it.

**Why did you stop developing it before?**

Well, that's a good question, allow me to list off the reasons by their effect on the project aswell as how I solved these problems

1. No map-making knowledge / mapmaker:Learned how to make maps
* No models available for custom weaponry:
I have found a good asset creator who will create some of them for free, the rest of the weapons will be hl2/css provided
* Garry's mod update/ low amount of documentation: Even still there is not a whole lot about the GMOD13 coding changes, however it has not changed incredibly much and I should be able to adapt to it from gmod12 documentation as well as what there is for gmod 13

Even if upon completion The Eternal War's time is over and no one here is interested, I hope to at least have gained the personal sense of accomplishment from the project and hopefully run my own server where some people will enjoy it. 

**How will the gamemode be different from what was discussed initially?**

The big change is that I hope to create an instancing system for the gamemode, I will run 5 servers 1 area for each faction as well as the disputed area (Of course the celtic rebels will exist somewhere within Celtania).  When you reach the maps edges it will connect you to the appropriate server. I realize that this will limit mobility of the actual gamemode being available on different hosts. so I ask you to discuss whether this is a good idea or not, keep in mind I am not even sure this is possible without creating a whole new sourcemod. So it is also possible to have one large map instead of 5 medium (which would be overall a 25% larger than the single map)

I've loved this game since I was a kid, and I honestly think it gets too much crap. I'm not purposefully trying to recreate The Eternal War, but I'm just trying to see how far into it I can get. This won't take 10 years as I have a lot of free time (I have a reason for this). Note: I used ALL civilizations, and I am playing as Rome. I also used a Pangaea continent. 
Here's what I have so far: It's 1969, and the world is at peace. In fact, it's never been to war, at least as far as Roman sources can determine. Which, you could say is a good thing as there are so many Mutual Protection Pacts floating around that if one civilization went to war, nearly half of all civilizations would end up in a bloody battle.
City life is excellent in the Great Roman Empire. Democracy is abound. The people are hedonistic and spoiled with how lavish their lifestyles are. But, something troubles the president. The nation isn't moving. Things are good, yes, but expansion is at a stand still. The president wishes to go to war and conquer China, the smallest nation on the map (4 cities. I'm not shitting you), but he knows of the drastic consequences that would follow if he did that.
On occasion, though, the spark of hope comes by as a city overthrows their government in favor of Rome. But, Rome is still very small. It takes advantage of whatever land it can get in a desperate attempt to expand, because the president knows that peace can't last forever.

So, I'm basically the complete opposite of Lycerius. Where he has been at war since possibly the dawn of time, I've been at peace just as long. He can't get out of war, I can't get in.
I'm not saying I want to go to war, but I'd just like to expand so I'm not so minuscule.

Or will the world descend into World War, and the arms race lead to the ultimate destruction of mankind? 

As of right now, the Russian Navy is attempting to destroy the Chinese navy and has refrained from attacking any Chinese cities. We await their offer of peace, since both of us have technologies that we can offer one another that would benefit each other. (The Chinese have Genetic Modification and Miniaturization, we have Mobile Warfare and Radio.) The uprisings in Yakutsk and Tbilisi were successfully squashed, but Kiev still rages, and the possibility of a Communist Uprising by 1917 grows near, bringing with it an interesting parallel with actual Russian history. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has undergone multiple revolutions since the late 1800s, going from Despotism to Monarchy to Republic to Fundamentalism in only a few years. Their empire is crumbling, and I see their belligerence towards Russia as a last ditch effort to save themselves and hold on to a civilization that is slipping away right through their fingers.

Update 1: In 1919 the Russian people revolt and a Communist government is in power by 1921.

Update 2: In 1925 the Japanese committed an act of espionage to steal the secret of mobile warfare from us. I responded by attacking their fleets gathered outside my territorial waters, and now the war just keeps escalating, with the Japanese still stealing technology from me using spies and upping the ante in their own arms race, and to make matters worse the Chinese have allied with the Japanese. Also, Democracy in Japan has failed, and a Fundamentalist government has taken over. While the Chinese Monarchy hasn't declared war on me yet, I assume it's only a matter of time before they will.

Update 3: In 1932 the Japanese surrendered after my navy destroyed several of their vessels and devastated the coastal city of Nagoya with my marines. Now everyone is at peace.

Update 4: It's 1946. A strategic alliance has been formed between The People's Republic of Russia and The Republic of China. Japan's fundamentalist government was brought down in favor of a Republic as well, and India, a Democracy, has made its great undertaking the building of a United Nations building. However, India is amassing a huge armada of battleships, cruisers, and transports outside my territory, leading me to suspect that they may be trying to make a power play by attacking me. They are the second largest civilization behind mine, and second most powerful militarily, so it would make sense for them to want to take out the competition. I might just hit them with a pre-emptive strike.....

1947-1957: I hit India with a pre-emptive strike, growing too scared of the armada India had been amassing to trust them not to attack. My allies in China quickly joined in, and forced the Indian army to fight a war on two fronts. Meanwhile, as I suspected the massive armada India had been gathering was indeed to attack me, as several Marines launched an amphibious assault on my capital city and cradle of the revolution Kiev. By the late 1950s the war was over, with India having the United Nations broker a cease-fire agreement. (Also, during the war, India had two revolutions: one instituting a Fundamentalist government and another soon after the cease fire had been signed returning India to a Democracy.) I destroyed about half of India's naval armada gathered near my country, the rest retreated. By about midway through the war I had completed The Manhattan Project and I used a nuclear weapon on India's most populous city Hyderabad to send them a message: Do not mess with Russia. Now my alliance with China is on shaky terms, since I used nuclear weapons most of the world sees Russia as a ruthless war mongering nation.

1957-present day (1975): There has been no major confrontation between any army, and India has been sending several trade caravans to exchange goods with me. The Russian people look to the stars and we have begun the early stages of a Space Race. As of the time of this writing it is 1975, the Russian space module is still in its early stages of development, only having life support, solar panels, and 1 unit of fuel. While no country but China wants to be in a formal alliance with me, I've noticed the Japanese and the Indians have become friends. It may become a 2vs2 situation where the Chinese and Russian armies fight together to crush Japan and India once and for all. Plus, I did nuke India after all, they probably have not forgotten that, and the fact that they are building nuclear weapons of their own is unnerving to say the least

I occasionally browse /r/theeternalwar subreddit.  Hell, it is the thing that inspired me to roleplay in Civ. 

I love the lore and the way Lycerius was building his Civ 2 game's world.  It felt so... real and... awesome.  Beautiful, maybe is a good word for it.  Just to hear the tale and politics and wars and culture of his people or the other nations people.

Anyway, I hate to sound like I am plugging an ad here, but since you are all roleplayers.  I thought I'd let you know that I run this subreddit based on multiplayer roleplaying in Civ V.  (I know it isn't about Civ 2, but the topic shares the basis of story-building/roleplaying like one might do here. :3)

It is called /r/realcivroleplay.  We have sort of died down since we started sometime in January of this year, but I have been eagerly trying to revive us to do more roleplaying ever since BNW came out.  Mainly because BNW adds so much to the experience of roleplaying your civ and being the nation leader and it's people with others who are doing the same in a multiplayer game.  

We have tested it out multiple times and it works well.  We have a set of rules and everything to keep the gamemode realistic and roleplay friendly as possible.

So, if you think you are interested, just come on over and check us out.

I hope I am not infringing on you guys over here.  I just thought you guys might be interested in knowing since it seems this subreddit is also about roleplaying/story-building except in Civ 2 and based around Lycerius' game.

* Find where your armies are, there are quite a few sleeping/fortified units that need to be moved.
* Make sure that your cities are working their best squares, often times after Harbors or Offshore Platforms are constructed the AI doesn't 'move' the workers for you.
* For the love of god, anything near water with high population NEEDS an Offshore Platform ASAP.
* Mid-tier cities near water should get a Harbor quickly.  More population = more production = good times.
* You have more money in the bank than you should, speed build some (see points above)!
* To fund this massive instant production, there are A LOT of improvements that you can sell off.  Note that this will also help your economy because you won't be paying upkeep.  These are:

&gt; Library/University/Research Lab: There is no more science, get rid of these for easy dosh.

&gt; Courthouse: Provides no benefit to Communist governments besides making the city more difficult to bribe (very rare).

&gt; Sewer System/Aqueduct: If it's obvious the city isn't going to climb to pop 7/12, sell these suckers.

&gt; Cathedral/Colosseum: No need to have these on cities with populations lower than 5-6, your population is already happy enough.

&gt; Supermarkets: Extremely pointless, you aren't going to be harvesting anything soon. 

* I prefer swapping all Armor production to Howitzers, they have higher attack than Armor, ignore City Walls, and are cheaper to build (which is major in an ultra-low production game like this).  The mobility loss is minor due to the clusterfuck of high movement squares anyways, and you should still have some Mech Inf to provide the actual defenses.  This is obviously a personal preference though.

* Careful with long-range automoves, the AI isn't the smartest and it going off the railroad tracks can equal a lot of turns extra.
* If you are going the mass-Engineer route to get the planet back to livable, do **NOT** attempt to transform the swamps, instead either irrigate or mine.  Transforming takes ~2.67x longer than either of the other two options.  Also, due to the low population, unless a city is absolutely surrounded by pollution or a valuable square is blocked, I wouldn't waste your limited number of workers trying to clean it up.
* Make sure any city producing Engineers isn't going to drop into 'Hunger'.  All you'd manage to do is waste your production when the Engineer dies due to lack of support anyways.
* Also make sure any city building Engineers is larger than size 1, again, you don't want to waste any production.

Good evening, Celtania. Due to technical failures, the Great Nation Radio broadcast signal has gone quiet for many weeks now. But fear not, for survival of the news is a given. In truth, we were attacked by those who would throw sanctuary and brotherhood to the enemy, those ""Celtic Independents"" who cower behind a flag that is not their own and mock the sacrifice and deaths of your friends and families.

The Independents are an enemy just as much as the backwards Vikings, just as much as the pathetic Sioux and the treacherous Americans. In fact, they may be our worst enemy- They who would look at their own home and wash their hands free, and then take up arms against their former comrades. 

In the attack on our broadcast station, there were four deaths, not including the two suicide bombers who threw themselves at our broadcast tower in an attempt to silence the word of truth and peace.
I myself lost a hand and took ill, but fear not, the radio will broadcast weekly from this point on until further notice.

And now, the weather.

Gray.

This concludes the weather. Now, onto Sports.

This concludes the sports. Now, onto the news.

Rumors of a Viking Anti-Missile shield are false, states a party spokeswoman. The Vikings are so backwards, they're barely capable of fighting, let alone causing harm to Celtic war machines. 

Due to morale issues in the front lines, pudding and candy rations in the capital and outlying cities have been re-routed to our men and women fighting on the American front. War is horrible, and we must maintain the well being of our soldiers in both body and mind.

A set of twins have been born with no noticeable mutation in Cardiff, to the Clark family, who's patriarch is a member of the Party Committee of Nuclear Engagements. Congratulations to them! 

A fourteen ton creature, with a length of nearly two hundred feet and a width of thirty has washed ashore in the southlands by Swansea, discovered by a fisherman. Inside of the creature's gut was a two ton chunk of an American submarine and the crew of twelve's remains. Scientists are still exploring the internal structure of the beast and hope to learn more about it's diet and life.

The species of the creature has baffled local scientists and officials, who have been unable to find anything quite like it in the historical record. It has four rows of teeth, a pod of eyes and over nine fins on each side. Party scientists speculate it is a member of a race of deep sea animals. Admission to see said creature is fifteen credits for adults
and five for children.

This concludes this broadcast of Great Nation Radio.
Celtania prevails.

Back in those days, it is written, the heat from the Suns touched even our lands. But now no longer. It seems our tribes are no longer deemed a threat to those who wield the Suns' power. It is spoken amongst the eldest of us that we, at one time, wielded such power. But that power was too great for us and, eventually, left us with the bitter wasteland we tend to today. 

We drive forth our syphon pumps into the scorched earth, whenever we are fortunate enough to find any. For most days, our pumps' hoses whir their way thru blue waters. Glowing, deadly blue waters. Though we drink not of these tides, the little bit of untainted moisture that is dredged forth by the pumps from the muck underneath provides for a bitter saturation to our lips. The bitterness of the sustenance is even moreso. At least with the muck there is wetness. Whenever these nanotek scavengers manage to find any form of nutrition for us, we are forced to consume it in capsule form. 

Living in the absolute edges of existence, most of us ask for what reason do we even continue to go on. Our lives are a continuous daily struggle to even survive, toiling behind barely useful machines to provide a meaningless, painful, cruel life. Machines strapped to our faces so that we may breathe and see. Machines strapped to our backs so that we may eat of the dirt and drink of the mud. 

Some are hopeful enough to look to the horizons and believe that, where the Glowing Suns are, maybe, just maybe, therein lies cities of salvation. The more realistic of us knows that the only salvation that lies therein is contained in the fleeting embrace of a fireball.

Today is June 13th, 3991, and this is your daily news, weather and bulletin! Let us begin by offering a word of praise for our beloved Party, who ensures our survival in these troubling times!

Last night's freak thunderstorm in Stirling caused severe damage to a local farm and the fire caused has burned half of the farm's potato harvest! As such, food rations in Cardiff and surrounding regions have been marked down by a quarter to help our brothers in need survive!

Good news from the Viking Front! An enemy camp was discovered yesterday by our brothers in the People's Defense Force and over sixteen enemy scouts were captured! Despite lies and claims of innocence, party official Ailis Kelly has vowed that all information shall be obtained from them through *any means* necessary!

The war may be ending soon! Word from the Party Headquarters in Cardiff reveal that talks of a ceasefire and nuclear disarmament in America are indeed on the table, as our longtime rival has both starved itself and fallen prey to famine, such as the fate of all foolish fundamentalists!

Divine providence doesn't seem to be in the cards for them, so says this radio operator! Remember, petty superstitious beliefs are the opiate of the masses! You must rise above the mistakes of our enemy and show them the strength and tenacity of the Celts!
Long live our permanent Revolution! Long live our immortal Party!

And now, word of a mandate from the Party Office of Laws and Decrees. 

It reads..

""This is a mandate to all Celtic citizens within our borders. Due to incidents in rural areas and reports from traveling Officers and law enforcement agents, it is noted that recent disappearances outside of Wrexham were caused by a band of highwaymen. The crimes of said criminals are not for the faint of heart, but know that they have been caught and executed. Theft and cannibalism will not be tolerated within our borders. Such is the activity of the desperate and inhuman. If you act as an animal, you will be put down like an animal. This concludes the mandate.""

And now, the weather.

Expect more heavy thudnerstorms today mixed with radioactive fallout. Remember to keep your breathing units secure at all time and to wear thick clothing if venturing outside of your home or workplace.

The usual summer insect levels remain as-is. 

On the bright side, ozone and allergy levels remain at zero! A thirty year record remains, as noted by the Party weather almanac! In celebration, the Party has decreed that one ration of chocolate will be allowed to all working families.

She could hear the jets chasing the American recon planes flying much closer today. The other kids on the assembly line were talking about how their parents think the Americans were up to something; and it was only bolstered by the bio-bomb that exploded in the market down the street from the factory. No doubt another American spy. On the road home, she passed more soldiers and tanks than normal, she could hear desperate shouts emanating from the radios as they flew by. Something about the front line and a last ditch.. whatever that means. 

Sleep that night was almost impossible; next to the constant cackle and boom of Sioux munitions, the ever-present drone of the hovering bombers made the house shake in ways it hadn't since the men with triangles on their flag had dropped all those bombs around town. The worst part was, it seemed to get louder with every passing minute. She could see the fire light up the sky as the front line guns fired, more and more desperately as the bombers sounded closer. She was scared now, she ran to her sisters' room and gathered them up and hurried them to the basement. Running to her parents room, she grabbed the only picture she had of them and flew down the stairs, locking all doors behind her. 

Even in the basement, the light of the guns got brighter and brighter; and the humming louder and louder. Her sisters were all in tears now, there was no consoling them when the Americans were near town. Ever since Mama had been killed in the great fire four years ago, and Papa was assassinated in the Factory Guild Guerrilla uprising, what was left of the family had never been the same. But she could barely remember them now, she could barely think with all the noise. She felt the bare ground under her feet shaking as the artillery unity retreated into the city and the bombers finally started to drop bombs. Kona looked directly into the gaping faces of her sisters and couldn't ever hear their screams. No one could hear anything. There was only fire.

The only things we still need to really do is get some main things down. If we're doing this, we've already got an icon, faction icons, and a few theoretical designs for the Vikings, but if we want to pull this off legit we need to settle on things.

Things that I can list off the top of my head would be...

* Faction-specific weapons

* Weapons that all factions can use

* Character design

* What kind of game we'll be having

* How the game will be made (mod for older game, mod for Minecraft, mod for Battlefield/DoD, game engine like Unity or Unreal [examples of great Unreal games built on the UDK website found [here](http://www.unrealengine.com/udk/)])

* Who'll be doing what

* Playable Faction/storyline for each faction

* Sounds/Voice acting (it'd be cool if we could get Lycerius to actually voice a character for the Celts)

* Map design

And lastly...

* Publishing/Kickstarting

It's big, but with any luck it won't be Eternal War big. Feel free to add anything to the list or if you want to do anything on the list feel free to do it!

 Knowing this, the Vikings have little choice but to strike pre-emptively at our over-funded, over-equipped, and over-aggressive military. 

As they wage their pointless war, our people starve. ""No, you may not build a granary,"" says President Breathnach, ""your steel is needed to build a tank."" ""No, you may not cut away the swamps,"" he sneers, ""your men are needed to cut away other men."" They say they fight for our safety, for our children's future, but are President Breathnach's children the ones dying in the radioactive swamps of Byblos? Freezing to death on the mountains of el-Amarna? Being vaporised by nuclear torpedoes in Sydney Harbour? Of course not.

(This ancient piece of subversive fiction was found hidden in the secret library of a high-ranking Party member, among many such fictitious documents. Contrary to the official Party histories, this article, and others found, seem to suggest that at one point there was a governmental body known as a ""senate"", that people were allowed a choice in ruling parties (of which there was more than one), and that The Great Leader Lycerius was not in fact a person, but a group of people held together by common ideals. Each of those concepts are ludicrous, of course, so much so that they barely even constitute thoughtcrime.)

**Prologue**

The sounds of a screaming woman where muted by the rushing cry of wind and sand knocking against the rotting walls. Tattered and dirty sheets pretending to be curtains flapped in and out of the window, pulled and pushed as a radiation storm boiled overhead. The sky was burnt brown and orange, and the ground hard from lack of rain. It was the lack of rain that started the dust storm, and the radiation only made it that much more dangerous to be out in. The radio had warned the region of it three days ago. It would likely last several more days still, but at the moment it was the furthest thing from Paul’s mind.


He stood outside the bedroom door of a two room shack. On the other side the screams kept coming, fighting against the storm outside to be heard. Each new wail brought out a fresh batch of sweat that Paul kept wiping away with the back of his hand. A single drop slid into his eye and he blinked it away as a scream that had lasted for what seemed forever, came to an end and turned into heavy panting.


“She’ll be fine boy.” Paul looked across the room and met the eyes of Stanley Ericson, father of the woman who had grown silent on the other side of the door. “Margaret knows what she’s doing, and she’s birthed plenty of whelps in her day. She’ll get Anna through this.”


“I know sir,” Paul answered, wiping away the sweat gathering on his upper lip, “But I still worry. The pregnancy—”


“Is like they all are son, so stop worrying before you jinx my daughter,” Stanley finished. “Now why don’t you tend that fire and make sure the water’s still hot.”


Paul nodded, eager for something to take his mind off of the crying from the adjoining room. He walked over to the hearth and picked up the fire-poker. The logs only needed a single prod to roar up again, but he gave a few more for good measure just to make sure. The flames licked the bottom of the cauldron hanging over them, and the steam from the cabbage stew rose up in a heavy wave that caressed the kettle hanging above it. Paul put the poker back to the side then stood silently to watch the flames. 


He must have dozed on his feet because the door slamming open behind him nearly made him stumble to the floor in surprise. He spun around and caught Margaret rushing towards her husband, a look of horror on her face. Paul took a step closer, but couldn’t catch any of the words his mother-in-law whispered to her husband. He opened his mouth, but didn’t even get a word out before Stanley ushered her back into the bedroom with the words, “Just get them cleaned up.”


Margaret disappeared again, and Paul’s father-in-law looked at him with what appeared to be apprehension. Paul’s stomach filled with lead as he thought the worse. Anna or the baby must have died. Or worse still, maybe they both had! Just get them cleaned up. The words echoed in his mind. They were both dead, both dead and bloody and Stanley didn’t want him to see them that way. He felt tears starting to burn in the corner of his eyes, and when he opened his mouth again to question his wife’s father, the words caught in his throat. He didn’t want to know suddenly.


“It’s a girl.” Stanley stated then, still watching Paul with an unreadable look in his eye.


“What?” Paul croaked, the lead ball in his stomach unsure of its place now.


“The baby, it’s a girl.”


Paul lifted a hand to his mouth and let out a relieved laugh, the tears spilling down his cheeks now but no new ones joining them. A girl! His baby was alive! He smiled behind his hand and wiped away the sweat again. As his hand fell away as he noticed that Stanley still didn’t look happy about the news. The lead ball returned full force.


“And Anna?” He asked.


“She’s fine boy, they’re both fine and healthy, and the baby is perfect.”


“I don’t understand, then what’s—”


“That is the damn problem! The baby Paul, she’s perfect.”


Paul still didn’t understand what his father-in-law was getting at. He took another step forward, arm outstretch to shake the other man’s hand in an attempt to lighten what should surely be a joyous occasion, but instead he let out a cry of surprise as Stanley stepped forward and curled a fist into his shirt, jerking him closer. They stood face to face now; the older man was nearly a foot taller despite the curve in his back. Paul could see a hint of spit leaking from Stanley’s cleft lip, and he swallowed, fighting off growing panic.


“The baby is perfect Paul; she’s got nothing wrong with her.” He paused, letting the words sink in, “I got to know now boy who you’re loyal to, cause if it ain’t me and my girls I’ll have to take you out back right now and shoot you and don’t you dare lie to me cause I’ll damn well know.”


Paul swallowed again, finding he had no saliva left. His words came out in a whisper, “To you sir, you and the girls, always. I’d never betray Anna, never, never her or my baby.”


Stanley nodded, then eased his grip away and let out a deep sigh, “You should go in and see her son then, she’ll be wanting your support.”


Paul nodded but said nothing more. He walked past his father-in-law and up to the bedroom door, giving it a light knock. Margaret answered a few seconds later, her face so openly afraid that it was impossible to not feel the same fear himself. Of course, the fear was wholly justified if what they were saying was true. He had to see it for himself though. She stepped to the side and let him in, and he walked to his wife who was lying in one of the beds, her brow soaked with sweat and the sheets beneath her still stained with blood and afterbirth.


The room was too warm and had the heady scent of blood, but Paul wasn’t at all uncomfortable with those things when Anna’s eyes met his own and she smiled. The room lit up around him and everything but her, fell away. He drew closer then sat beside her on the bed. She was cradling a bundle of cloth in her arms, and nestled inside the cloth he could see the pink skin of his new daughter. Her eyes were closed, and her cheeks were ruddy. She was beautiful. Neither of them spoke as they stared down at the child they had created together.


“Your father,” Paul said at long last, “he says she’s…” He didn’t want to finish the sentence so he let the words hang unspoken in the air.


Anna nodded, “There’s nothing at all.” Her voice was hoarse from the hours of intense labor.


Paul met her eyes. He had always thought Anna to be beautiful, and maybe she was compared to most women. Her face was unblemished, and her head wasn’t malformed. One might have thought she was perfect as well if it weren’t for the crippled, tumorous legs she couldn’t stand on. The wheelchair in the corner was hers, and her younger sister sat in it dozing. Aside from the legs and thinning hair though, Anna was as close to perfection as anyone could have come in Chicago, but the baby… Paul lowered his eyes to her, then reached out and lifted away the swaddling.


Ten toes, he counted; ten fingers; no unusual bone structures, no ulcers or cysts; no spinal curvature or cancerous bulges. Physically, at least, the girl really was perfect. Only time could tell about mentally, but still, physical perfection was as dangerous as anything else these days. He tucked the cloth back around her.


“What if they take her?” Anna asked, fear in her tone apparent.


Paul wiped away the sweat on his face again as he thought about the government units nobody ever really spoke about, the ones who promoted a ‘healthy future’ by asking for parents to volunteer their healthiest children for…well for whatever they had in mind. “We won’t let them,” he answered, “I won’t let them.” Their eyes met again, “I swear it to you.”

http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/v0ilj/an_attempt_on_a_casuality_count_for_the_eternal/

(Important Note: In the Celtania figure, I'm also counting the Independents that have been rebelling for 1000 years between the shift to communism and 3991 AD.)

What I totally missed was New Vikingland, America and, to a lesser extent, the Siouxs. 15 million people call Celtania their home, 5,26 million Americans exist and 5,17 million Vikings (goes up to 5,43 million) are present as of 3991 AD. In addition, there are 110 000 Siouxs.  

Now, to extrapolate, we know that 90 % were killed off due to the nuclear exchange at the start of the war (late 23rd century's my guess). And due to conditions that the war present (massive amount of radiation, total destruction of arable land, melting ice caps etc.) one can assume that the population didn't recover.

It's pretty blurry, of course, but from that, we can say that the population of what in the 40th century are Celtania, New Vikingland, America and Sioux were (rougly) 150 million + 51 million + 52 million + 1 million at War's beginning. The 90 % death toll the first ten years equal 140 + 46 + 47 million + .900 000 = almost 234 million deaths the first ten years. 

Now, for what I count as war deaths, I ONLY count those who die by the weapons, nukes included. I do not count enviromental factors, such as post-nuclear blast fallout (which is everywhere, mind you). 

Now, this is highly conjenctual, but a average number of 800.000 combat deaths a year (or around 3 % of the world population) - which would be a nice estimate given that massive battles and nuclear strikes on cities happen very often (extrapolated from the 500.000 number in my first attempt) yields 800.000 multiplied by 1690 (the years since the initial cataclysm) which is 1352 million combat deaths, or 1.352 billion total deaths. Celtania and Lycerious have bore the worst number, with 845 million. America and New Vikingland each have taken around 235,5 million deaths. Sioux numbers are neglectable in this calculation, since they've not been touched majorly.

Adding the inital 234 million to the 1.352 billion makes the revised grand total casuality count of the War (tl, dr) this:

1586 million people, or 1.586 billion people, have died in combat or as a direct result of nukes during the 1700 years that the Eternal War has gone on, from start to 3991, the point of the save game. 

This poses a good challenge still: Can someone lead Celtania to victory while avoiding the 875 million dead mark (the 58-year solution would, if the trend continues, an additional 29 million, which result in 876 million dead, just barely missing)? Can someone pick up the pace for Vikingland / America and avoid 250 million? Or will someone lead the Sioux to glory while avoiding 10 million casualities?",,False,,t5_2ua25,1339718365.0,,Sioux,True,t3_v2jnc,http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/v2jnc/eternal_war_casuality_figure_revised_long_post/,

Good afternoon, Celtania!

A short bulletin for you today! Remember, working hard pays dividends for your brothers and sisters! We must all pitch in for the great rebuilding process that is to begin as soon as the war is over! 

We have struggled much, my countrymen! Great Lycerius has lead us through dark days and holds a torch ready for us at the end of the tunnel. 

A rash of suicides on the front lines by Party Officers has been discredited as enemy propoganda, says party spokeswoman Ailis Kelly.
Said enemy is the Independent, the man who strives against the common man and his own brother, the veritable Cain to our Able!

Report any and all Independent to your local official Party Office! Our enemy may be within our very homes! Your husband, your wife! Keep an eye out for those who claim one thing and do another! 

M-My wife, even when I believed she stayed out of politics, was outed by our son as an Independent and sent to a reeducation camp in the west! I .. 

I stand with my Party, brothers and sisters! The Party will lead us against this new threat, these so called 'reformists.' They wish to fix something that isn't broken. Our Party is strong! Our party is invincible!

Beware the Sioux! They may claim to wish for peace, but like everyone on this world, they stare at glorious Celtania with hungry eyes and hearts of avarice! 

It is only a matter of time before they are bombed into compliance!
We must stand tall! The war is almost over, but *we must see it through.*

**WAR IS STRENGTH!**

**MERCY IS WEAKNESS!**

**RELIGION IS IGNORANCE!**

**NEVER FORGIVE, NEVER FORGET THE ENEMY'S CRIMES!**

**HAIL, CELTANIA!**

Have a wonderful day, my brothers and sisters! And, I'm sorry for the missed update yesterday! I was predisposed and dealing with personal matters at home. Belated Father's Day, friends! Belated father's day indeed.

I assure you, I will be seeing you all Wednesday, or my name isn't Connor Ross! My comrade and 'double' as it were will fill you in Tomorrow, provided all is well!

Now, I don't want to be an asshole and divide the community - I'd really like to see an Eternal War game made. It's a great setting. There's a lot of cool stuff there. 

I'm not going to pretend to be eminently well-informed about the ins-and-outs of game development. I'm just as much a noob as the rest of you. But here's the blunt truth:

* My lowball estimate for devtime in man-hours on an RPG by a professional team is 500,000+ (150 employees x 60 hours a week x 18 months). If any of us were professionals, we wouldn't be talking about making a fan game. We'd be lucky to do the same in half the time.
* Even attempting to do something like that is downright silly - anything approaching a full-blown RPG, Fallout mod or not - is going to require a massive amount of resources that this community is not going to be able to muster. We're talking massive amounts of 3D models, textures, code, scripting, things that cannot be cranked out as quickly as dialogue and story can. (I say this as a writer.)

The only reasonable path to take with that information is to scale down the project. Massively. Sure, it's not as sexy, but it might actually happen. Here's my proposition.

1. I think we can all agree we like RPGs. So let's keep that. Let's keep an RPG system at its core.
2. But let's pare it down to combat - really, the core of The Eternal War - and have one map to minimize content creation requirements.
3. AI is fucking hard to write properly, especially for tactical RPGs. Let's do multiplayer instead.
4. Writing net-code that can handle real-time multiplayer is really hard. Let's go turn-based.
5. Writing a game engine is really hard. Let's find one that has a lot of the work done for us. Unity3D is a good choice here, especially since it uses C# and Javascript, two languages which I think many of us programmers are familiar with.

Now I can write, design, do graphic design work, program and texture. (Quality in that order.) I'd be willing to contribute a good chunk of my time to making this a thing. On that note, I have a [RPG system](http://refugerpg.blogspot.com/) in development that would be pretty ideally suited for this setting, and would only be modestly difficult to implement (compared to d20 or GURPS or something).

tl;dr: An RPG is way too complicated for a small volunteer team to complete. We should make a one-map, turn-based, Eternal War MOBA in Unity instead.

Long time chess fan here who would like to introduce you all to a fantasy variant for the game that I made. I also like to call it ""Portal Chess"" or ""Poker Chess"" since you can get a group together and play this with chips much like you would poker.

I think it fits TEW well since, in theory, the game could go on and on with no end in sight (unlike vanilla chess in which pieces are captured until only a few are left).

This game divides the board into territories. For those of you who are in the know, there's a term used in chess to refer to an invisible line that divides the board in half called a ""Frontier Line"" (see [this example](http://i45.tinypic.com/2remk2x.png)) in which if any of your pieces cross this made up line you are considered in the enemies territory.

For a three player game it gets a bit tricky, but here's one way to divide it evenly: [three way frontier line](http://i47.tinypic.com/mjl55v.png)

**RULES OF THE GAME**

* The board starts completely blank (no pieces anywhere)

* Every player is given 40 chips (poker chips) at the start of the game

* Each turn, that player may choose to move one of his/her pieces -OR- place a piece on the board *anywhere within their territory*

* To place a piece, you must pay the amount equal to the pieces' value (pawns = 1, bishops &amp; knights = 3, rooks = 5, queen = 9)

* Starting with white, each player places their king somewhere within their territory (kings cost 1 for rules-sake)

* Pay the amount into a collective ""pool""

* If you capture an enemy piece, you may take from the pool the amount equal to the captured piece's value (example: you capture a rook so you take 5 chips from the pool)

* There is no castling, en passant, double jumps or promotions for pawns

* Pawns can move forward, backward, left or right but still capture diagonally

* You may only play pieces that you have of your color; may only move/place one piece per turn, etc.

That's it! The goal is the same as the original: check mate. Only this time captured pieces could make a come back later on, so you'll want to destroy your enemy again and again until they run out of money and can no longer wage war against you!

**EDIT: Note that if you mate an opponent in a multi player game, you would take from the pool equal to all of the pieces the defeated player had on the board and NOT necessarily all of their chips**",,False,,t5_2ua25,1346291526.0,,,True,t3_z1v7z,http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/z1v7z/chess_the_eternal_war/,

Good Evening, Celtania! 

It has come to the attention of several members of this station and the party that there is rumors of another nation outside of our conflict, called the 'Sioux'- Fear and fret not, however, my brothers, for the remnants of the Sioux nation exist in radioactive wastelands and there is no threat for the common Celt! 

Please, think about things before spreading rumors of people living out there in the wastes and fringes! If you have time to be superstitious, you have time to work and to benefit your fellow man! We all must pitch in and strive to make our lives and country better!

Even if they DID exist, the years of radiation and lack of food in the region would likely have turned the entire lot of them into degenerates! And now, onto the news!

A minor bulletin, personally! My name is NOT Three-Dog! Who names their child Three-Dog? Come on, Celtania, I enjoy a joke just as much as anyone else but c'mon! 

News and rumors of a 'flesh eating pathogen' in Dublin and outlying regions are false, say party official Ailis Kelly. The sudden rise in illnesses are identifiable as caused by known fungus and diseases. If you are sick, please cordon yourself off from your family and reduce the spread of disease. Remember to wear your protective gear at all times and do *not* drink the still water or eat anything resembling a fish*!

Glasgow's own Sinead Higgins, born in Dublin has reached the amazing age of 60! Marveling at this, party officials visited her medical containment unit and marveled at the wonders of modern science and medicine! Death can be defeated, says Doctor Edna Gilmore! 
About time, says this radio operator!

And now, the weather.

Same conditions as before. Possible break in ash storms later today. Insect swarms on the coast are expected. Hazardous gear is advised.

Thank you for choosing Great Nation Radio, your only choice in radio!

I watched the clocktower strike thirteen as the sun came to spread its bliss across the ashen ground. The acid rain lay in pools, slowly chewing the concrete away. I saw a young boy clad in nothing but a bedsheet run into the street. There was a cry from his mother and then another premature bloodstain on the gutter of the ruins. I heard them. Thousands, maybe more, marching over the landscape and across the horizon before disappearing under a fuzzy line. Even without my glasses I saw the gas mask cladded men turn their back on yesterday, peer out into the ruins and the dark soil where their wives and husbands would cradle their knees. Even miles away, even through fog and nuclear mist, even through the patches of rain, even through the remains of the trees and even through the condensation of the glass on their gas masks I still saw those cries. Those tears. They were turning their back on eighteen years of their life, to fight once again for “Peace, land and bread”. Just like generations had done before.

Beyond the hills and the crackled mountains, beyond the thunderstorms and into the harsh wastelands of the borderzones there brewed a cosmic stalemate. Men were slaughtered. Our government called it war, we called it mass grave digging. Dig. Dig. Dig. I was one of them. The young boys and girls would come home in bags of limbs and bones, and we were lucky to get any bits back at all. The cannibal gangs that hunted the endless drones of vans that came back to the ruins, they were always struck upon.

The war, the long eternal war, had wiped off the humanity. My friends had all fought, and died, and I wondered if at some point when I ventured into the mass graves I might have picked up the bits of them. While wading through the marshes, with the damp rising radiation just tingling away at your body you begin to feel something. Even as you pick up the bits of rotten flesh, wipe away the fleas and look into the dirtied bloodbits you wonder if you know this piece of mankind. If you held his hand, or played and hide and seek with him in the mornings, if you grew up with him and played games and found worms or if you skipped with her, laughed with her or even made love to her. My wife went to war the day of our marriage. I had taped together the remains of a bedsheet as her wedding dress, and soon the great glorious nation plunged her into a suit and threw her down the valley of death. I was left behind, waiting to scoop up her remains.

The clocktower struck again, and I felt time ebb away. I felt my memories come to drip a little bit. I remember wandering the halls of a dilapidated school, uncovering the dusty drawings of some bygone child and feeling the sting of tears wallow behind my face. I remember being told by my big brother, just before he was slaughtered, about what he had heard. About what little scrap of information he could get out of his shell-shocked great-grandfather, one of the fabled 'Hundred Survivors' from a battle long ago. He had dragged himself out of the atomic mud and, with only his arms left, dragged himself back to kiss my great-grandmother. He was hung for 'Cowardice' by a visiting Marshall.

My great-grandfather had told my big brother this: “When I came to the focal point, the bottom of the valley's spiral, I did not see soldiers but I saw men. I saw these lands of America, these Celts...” He paused for a bit, taking a few heavy breaths. “I saw this two-thousand... three-thousand... this eternal war all suddenly gain a little perspective. There are piles of bodies, and the stench rips your nose. But, I realized something that day. I realized that there's no such thing as a future anymore. There's no such thing as history.”

He reached down to my big-brother's level, who was now utterly entranced.

“Do you even wonder... the names of our country? Do you ever wonder my boy why we don't have names too? It's because we're just fodder. Just meat for the immortal grinder. Chewed by a machine... you'll be gobbled up too by the 'war effort'. There's no point fighting it. The only thing we can teach our kids today...” And my great-grandfather was apparently roaring in tears now, “Is acceptance. That there is no future for them.”

I had happened upon the grave digging job by complete accident. The previous grave-digger died of old age. Some of us called him the luckiest man alive. The torch passed to me, and soon I was dragging bags from the vans that flocked in. They were driven by children. Sometimes I'd be called into the marshes by the Marshals, asked to scoop up the rifles and the metals, so it could all be melted down and fed into factories to produce more rifles and metals, so it could be fired on some foreign field into some foreign man. Then it'd decay into the ground, be flushed upwards by the water and picked by me decades from now. I picked up the bits of flesh I could find too, run them back into the ruins and dump it into the graves. Landfills even. One giant sign written in rotten ink: 'UNKNOWN'.I hear the sirens call in the distance. It's the end of curfew. The enforcing Marshall Snipers wander into the street, one of them rips the bedsheet off the dead child. His mother comes running, they grab her by the hair and yell obscenities. They start to gather round, start to feel her and smack her around. One of them looks up at me, and I know the signal. I nod.

Mass rape is commonplace. The Marshalls visit now and then, just to check on the ruins and see how everyone is doing. Usually terribly. Then they go into the guard trailers with the women of the town and invite the curfew guards and the Army reserves to take a peek. To have a feel. I knew a Marshall once who came into town, and he was the most compassionate man I have ever met. He shot the pregnant women, he slaughtered the children and then took his own life by breaking his own curfew. I remember carrying his body to the landfill, trying to picture just exactly what made him such a hero. He could've pillaged the women of the place, he could've been rotten and keep the status quo. Instead, he didn't flee back to the city centre where the barracks and the bureaucrats lay. Instead, he decided to do the kindest thing possible. When I threw his grave into the hole of flesh mess, holding my mouth with a handkerchief (the smell could make you vomit for weeks) I thought of his growing up, about what made him into such a kind fellow. The man who ended the future if only for the lucky ones.

The sirens blare in the distance and the roars flood the town. I hear the screaming woman in the street and the heaving guards. They will slit her throat afterwards, maybe deliver the body to me or provide a treat for the Cannibals who'll give them the scavenged rifles and pieces in exchange for a meal. I walk throughout this ruined place and I wonder how lucky I am. For everyone else will die, but not everyone will remain like I do.",,True,,t5_2ua25,1339531364.0,,,True,t3_uyhjf,http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/uyhjf/nsfw_short_story_landfills/,

-----

Even as a child, I never knew the face of my father.  Somehow, in these final moments, I imagined his crooked nose and mighty jaw.  I saw clearly his sandy hair and deep, soulful eyes.  He appeared just as my mother had described, so many times... so many years ago.  He still wore the uniform of Celtania, though stained as if he just returned from the field.  He beckoned for me to follow, just as the brothers in blue always said he would; I followed dutifully.  A soldier always follows dutifully.

-----

I moved slowly through the ruined warehouse, searching for the remaining members of my squad.  They had broken for cover the moment they heard the rumbling thrum of the American warmachines, leaving me alone and exposed in the street.  I turned into a doorway just as the spidery contraptions rounded the corner and opened fire, laser-guided submunitions spalling the plascrete behind me.  Having narrowly escaped the fusillade, I ran for the stair at the far side of the building, hoping to get a vantage from the rooftop.

I could hear the horrible machines below, along with a chorus of strange voices; I'd never known infantry to travel with these... things.  The metal beasts were often said to have minds of their own, though few lived to tell such tales.  Officially, they were drones - machines we knew to have human ""pilots"" somewhere behind the battle line, perhaps even as far away as the American capitol.  I felt a great need to see for myself, though it could easily mean my death.  I mounted the roof and carefully glanced over the kneewall from as low a crouch as my gear allowed me.

There were men in grey fatigues, each man's garb covered over with some sort of multi-colored netting.  As they moved, it made it difficult to tell that each man was there at all - each but a shifting shade with a battle rifle.  Even their full-faced black helmets had no distinct outline.  The mechanical monsters rumbled slowly behind them, swaying their ""heads"" side to side in (what seemed altogether too purposeful) a scanning motion.

-----

There was a great fire the night before the final assault on the last American bastion, the city of Phledphia.  The rabble had set alight fully half the buildings in the block where a Viking battalion camped, the troops awaiting the order for the last big push up that ruined slope to the capitol.  They must have believed the Viking Horde weak against the flames, but that has never held true.  After all, the Viking Horde was the spark that set the whole world ablaze.

Ages past, with all the great powers arguing amongst themselves, the Vikings rose anew.  They gathered their strength over a century; none suspected this ancient race of Northmen would ever pose as great a threat as once they did, harrying the coasts of what once was Europe.  While the other nations occupied themselves with arrogant posturing, the Vikings - ever men and women of action - launched the first strike in what became a World War.

The world spun immediately into chaos.

Don't you love the smell of freshly baked, government sponsored bread in the morning? Remember the rationing is in place to help you, we are all struggling together, do not commit theft. 

Today's report focuses on several uprisings against our leader Lycerius. The so-called ""Celtic Independents"" better known as separatists, wish to tear our land asunder and prepare for enslavement by the Viking horde. Obviously so in love with their own barbaric tendency, they try and entice poor, hungry and defenseless members of the public into their dark nets with promise of gold and mead. The honourable among us know that this is merely a ploy to suck the life out of Celtania. 

However our brave, valiant security forces are ever ready to guard the Celts against any intrusion.  If you hear such throwaway talk against our government and so, its people, report these traitors straight away!

And now for an announcement.
""The Eternal Leader needs your vigilance against the American threat. Report any suspicious persons to the nearest department of the People's Security Force."" - *creepig*

Straight from the desk of Lycerius, a new push into the marshes will yield farmland for the first in centuries. However the evil Viking wishes us dead and so tries to uproot all that we have achieved. When we sow seeds, they tear out the sapling, when we tend to the plants, they seize for themselves. Help us to help you, enlist today and drive the barbarians from our borders! 

Finally a weather report. 

Rain is expected over the North of Celtania, with Alexandria and Thebes having rain for the next two days. Government Celebrations in Cardiff this weekend will not be disrupted and should have clear skies. 

Thank you for choosing Great Nation Radio, your only choice in radio!

Mercy to a Viking is cruelty to your Celtic brothers. - *DerylBreadda*

I want to play the ""Eternal War"" and I'm not sure which version of Civ II to use, 2.42 (or similar) or Multiplayer Gold. 
The increased hostility of the AI in Multiplayer Gold would make peace with the Americans much harder, but it might reflect the history of the nations better and would explain why Lycerius could never achieve lasting peace. So what's your preference?

Capt. McChrysler, CO of Viking Battalion Kilo559, posted at the 110th Meridian Viking-Celtic border. My second-in-command, 1stLt Julestone, is monitoring all communications' wavelengths for the order to advance. We have held this post for seven weeks now, long enough to observe the transition from the cold autumn months into the full-on snowing season. The morale of the men has gone from verbally irate to silently depressed. We are all completely tired in every sense of being; mentally, physically, and emotionally. 

When we first arrived I was proud to tell them we were going to be the front line. Proud to explain how we were the primary offensive that would cripple the Celtic empire. Now I see my folly. The first word we received via the wireless broadcast was of dissension within the capital. While we were marching toward the enemy, back home, our friends and families were becoming the enemy. I lost 60% of my troops that first week. More and more walked off with each passing day. The threat of execution no longer phases them, so I no longer uphold the punishment. Then we had an unexpected turn of events only three days ago. Reinforcements. Granted, it was only a squad of six men, and they were the most inexperienced group of nubs I've ever laid my eyes on, but I haven't been so glad to lay my eyes on anyone since I first met my wife. They were led by Cpl. Kirk, who was ordered to fortify the front and await further orders from the Battalion CO, meaning myself. And with their CO awaiting orders, himself, there doesn't seem to be much more to do than hurry up and wait. 

I've decided to man the evening reconnaissance watch myself with 1stLt Julestone as my spotter. Scanning the horizons, I find nothing but swamps, sand, and desolation. Suddenly a fleeting glimmer catches my eye. My optical implants are within calibration parameters and there was definitely something picked up by my infrared. I switch to passive thermals and the horizons still appear clear. 

Without warning I hear, ""Mack, you should see this."" 

I whip around asking, ""Jules, what the fuck is so importan..."" but the sight freezes the words in my mouth. Behind us, standing in front of Julestone, is Kirk. And he's chuckling. 

""M..mm.Mack...""

""Jules, I see him,"" I say, as I've already switched my optics. As if I couldn't tell by the glow in his eyes, I can see the ionizing radiation streaming off of him. And I know precisely what this means. This cocksucker has a bomb. And he's arming it. 

The last sound I hear, before the electronic beep of the nuclear trigger, is Jules: ""Oh sh-""

I've seen that many posts are about women living in Celtania while sons and husbands are drafted to war while women stay at home to work in factories have children etc. Similar to WWII.

I've been thinking a little, wouldn't make more sense for women to be drafted as well, then can fight, shoot, kill as well as men. And in a world where any single advantage could mean the war is won wouldn't make sense the 3 remaining faction to give all they can, trying to get that little advantage that could make them win?

Greater numbers in the front could most definitely make the difference between victory and defeat.

I think it makes more sense that those unable to fight (men or women) sick or of younger age to work in factories (who needs education right?) while the older (18+ or maybe even 16+) and able to go to arms.

I don't have Civ II, so I haven't downloaded the save game, but the best (and most moral) solution to this horrific world you have created would be to deliberately lose to one of your two opponents, breaking the balance and ending the stalemate, which would allow one of the other civilisations to heal the world.

Reddit solved the problem quickly, but has anyone considered the alternative, simpler solution?

Surrender. Think of this in real life terms, in which nuclear war is never worth it because it destroys everything you're trying to protect. I didn't play Civ2 much. I am a fan of Galactic Civ2, and I realized, as I landed Drengin cruisers filled to the brim on unsuspecting planets, that I was killing billions of people. It made me rethink my strategy, and I think it could be applied to Civ 2. Rather than invade I usually try diplomacy or culture. When someone invades me, if I can't protect it, I surrender the planet - because regardless of side, the battle still costs billions of lives. The stakes aren't quite as high in Civ2, but the consequences in-game are severe. So:

Nothing seemed real as he made his way to the centre of the crowd where a hole was made for the returning heroes. The faces of these men, no-- not men; boys, were still trying to shake off the fear that had stricken them just the night before. They night that felt like years as they lay in wait in their foxholes for the firebombers the strafe the Americans out of their cots. These boys were heroes, and for what? Clearing out the charred bodies of those god loving hethans, so that they could stroll in and act triumphant. Just another flag to change.. 

That's when the guerrilla militia fired a RPG out one of the tall buildings, and he was jarred awake. It was no wonder the crowd felt to surreal, he hadn't been to victory parade since that day; and a building hasn't stood taller than that damn hotel in New Caledonia sine the Thor was dropped in 3981. The sickly sweet smell of the ass end of Deepmoore swamp filled his nose as he tried to stand up out of a pool f blood he hoped was his for once. He couldn't hear a thing but a faint ringing, his ears never rang as much since a MK24u fission grenade blew up half his recon squad and took a piece of ear with it. He had gotten lucky that day, just another story to tell..

His CO and half the platoons of his division had taken to calling him Lucky Lucifer, because there's is no way a man should be able take eleven bullets, a grenade and a half dozen other explosives, a sixty foot flight out of a wrecked APC, enough radiation to kill a radroach, much less live to be thirty-eight, without the luck of a devil behind him. It seemed he had done it again; he felt the familiar pit in his stomach as he looked around to see his platoon decimated by what he assumed was a Viking Gullveig fire bomb. Or maybe a M33Howler; it had been hard to tell the bombs apart for the past few months after CIC operatives infiltrated Viking factories nationwide and poisoned food supplies in an attempt to kill workers. That loudmouth ThreeDog on Great Nation Radio said the covert operation was an overwhelming success but the half dead Engineer platoon could tell you all about how there are still plenty of munitions coming out of Viking factories. Half of them don't even explode and the other half do damage in ways that would make even an old man like Lucky Lucifer have nightmares. But he had made it out again, and with little more than a radrash and a bloodied headpeice. He had a half-dead assembly line to send another fuck you card to. Just another crazed worker in a factory across the Iron Wall...

He knew if he stayed in this death pit much longer he would get to meet the pyro-squads who swept the marsh on a five hour basis looking for stray CIC agents migrating from city to city, and he had no plans on seeing another burn ward. He made his way to to engie transponder and signaled his location to HQ. He didn't mention his platoon, he knew they'd be gator bait before the Bog-Runner tanks got there to pick him up. Wading through neck high, murky water for high ground, he got to a knoll tall enough set off his last flare and wait.

Ten minutes later, after weathering his thousandth swarm of swamp flies, the Bog-Runners were in sight. He grabbed his rifle and made his way to the behemoths. Tank Commander Griffeth gave his usual three finger salute, he'd give more if he had 'em. Lucky Lou raised his rifle above his head in recognition and a smile broke out on both of their faces. Griffeth knew he had another Lucifer story to tell his CO buddies. At that, the familiar cackle f the Ull-12 sniper rifle echoed the swamp. Griffeth felt the bullet scream by as it pinged off the front of the tungsten hide of his Runner; looking up with a bigger smile at Lou. The smile had melted of a lucky man's face as he looked down at his bleeding chest. Right through the heart. He dropped and a hell of a fire fight zoomed across the blue sky he was now forced to look at. He knew what was coming, and didn't call for help. He knew he would be just another casualty. Just another body to burn. Soldiers no longer had the dignity of burial since the homeland ran out f solid ground to bury the hundreds of soldiers being sent home in boxes. He knew the division would solemnly talk about how Lucky Lucifer's luck had finally run out. But with his final breath, he thought how he had never been this lucky in his whole life.

The tactical enhancements of Civ5 would definitely lend themselves well to this sort of conflict.  I'm thinking after we get a chance to try out religion, it, along with Civ5's social policies, may lend themselves well to methods of working around the conflict in a world where technology and growth is stagnant.

For my part in why I should be trusted to put something like this together, I'm in the credits of Civ4 as a play tester (I was part of a team called ""Frankenstein""), and while uncredited, also wrote the Hemispheres map script, which was published in an expansion.  I haven't done much modding with Civ5 yet, but I'm a programmer in my day job.

To start out with a few ideas:

 * I'd like to at least initially put it together as a scenario, starting in 3991 with the same three civs (the celts will have to wait until the XP, so I'll use England for now as a placeholder).
 * The tech tree may be repurposed later, but for now it will start with the standard game tree, with everything discovered.
 * All terrain will be tundra or desert.
 * One area in which I'd like to depart from the original, is with an Earth map, but I'm flexible on this one.

Please contribute any ideas you'd like, and upvote those that you think would be cool.  I'd like to avoid changing the base game functionality too much, because without the proper SDK it can be more trouble than it's worth, but don't let that keep you from brainstorming.  It's worth putting down the good ideas so we can come back to them later when the SDK is released (and there's been hints that it may soon be).",,False,,t5_2ua25,False,,,True,t3_uyh6b,http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/uyh6b/planning_a_civ5_scenario_andor_mod_based_on_this/,

In any situation like this, you have to focus your attack on the weakest opponent.  That is just war logic.  Keep the Vikings at bay - fall back to Giza, Hieraconpolis and Byblos (as in picture 1), whilst focussing all of your attacks on the American homeland.

Keeping the Vikings contained should be comparatively easy with a good foothold on their island of seven cities (picture 3) and a front line that has not moved for years (picture 1).  You have two thin narrow corridors that you can play '300' in and hopefully keep the situation fairly static.

In comparison, the Americans have a smaller area of the map, are weaker and you already have cities within their homeland.  They are also connected by land to your core cities, so infinite moving railroads can hit them the moment a new unit is born (missed this in later Civs).  With a focus on this island, you should be able first get to the small isthmus in the South East of picture 3 (by San Francisco) and then ultimately restrict them to the island with NY and Washington on.  

The trick to this strategy - which I can't believe is that new really, is to contain the Vikings and try and get them to waste resources on your strong defences while you focus on the Americans.  Other postings are going to help, one that resonated with me was the poster that noted you should try and create a core set of cities (Dublin, Cardiff, Cork, Monte Cristo) that are cleaned up and are as good as they can be.

Lycerius says that the stalemate is so tight that all he can build is tanks. This is what he needs to do. 

OPERATION (post below a name for it)

STEP 1)   Whenever lycerius is in control of the cities that change hands frequently build tanks in those cities and in one of your port cities begin to construct troop transport ships. Whenever possible (and not endangering the war effort) put aside a tank or two to load onto these ships. This could take hundreds or even a thousand more years but is necessary if you want to defeat the Neo-Vikings and 'muricans.

STEP 2)     After you've put aside a force large enough to take an enemy city put all your ""special ops"" onto transport ships and attempt to take over a city. Thus should work for two reasons. 
1) I don't believe you can nuke ocean going vessels and
2) it's conceivable that your two opponents haven't had enough spare resources to build a navy.
If the capture of the port city is not successful then repeat. If it is successful move on to step 3

STEP 3)    Once you control one of these cities one of two things will happen 
1) they'll nuke there own city and will have one less city to construct tanks from which is good for Lycerius OR

2) The opponent will realize how precious each city is and try to retake it. This would cause the country to be forced to fight a two front war changing the dynamics of the game. 

My hypothesis is that whichever country you choose would soon fall leaving you to defeat the final opponent. At this point you would hopefully seize enough of the dying country to give you the edge over the last enemy.

Gabriel Collins was an exceptional young man. He was born in the Inner Capital to a wealthy family and exceled in school, graduating two years early at the age of 16. Being a born athlete as well as an intelligent student, he decided to pursue a career in the military, dreaming of one day being a high-ranking general, leading the American forces to victory and finally wiping out the Vikings and Celts. Since he could not enlist until he was 18, he attended a special academy and began training as soon as he got out of school. The world might be a devastated wasteland at this point, but the Inner Capital along with New Chicago and Seattle, which house the richest and most powerful men left alive, are still sprawling cities that provide some glimpse into the world that could have developed if it weren’t for the war.

Now, at the age of 20, Gabriel leads a special squad, overseeing the captures of the most important cities. While this usually means fighting on the front lines and assaulting strategic settlements, this time was different. The target was a small city, which under regular circumstances wouldn’t have bothered anyone. However, after a few hundred years under Viking control and for the first time since the war began, yesterday at dawn it was captured by American forces. As a part of a new strategy, the generals need to capture as many cities as possible and send in specialized scientists accompanied by guards to investigate and search for a way to grow vegetation in the swamplands which now cover most of the Earth.

Usually, after a city is captured, a window of 24 hours is given to the soldiers until they are given the orders to prepare for a counterattack. Most of the times it takes the enemy forces at least two days to regroup and retaliate, but you can never be too safe. In that window the specialized scientists scour the city, which is more than enough time. However, yesterday’s capture proved to be an anomaly. It started with the scientist calling in a “4057”, which means an object of interest has been found, and continued with the Vikings assaulting the city within 8 hours of losing it. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that there is something that the Vikings don’t want the Americans to know about this place, and that’s exactly why Gabriel’s squad was transferred for the attack.

The Viking offensive was swift and decisive with heavy casualties on the American side as the soldiers were basically on break. Most of the rifles were out of reach, and some of the men were even asleep as the bombs fell. Fortunately, the 4057 code alerted the High Command to send some reinforcements before the assault began, so the counter-attack shouldn’t take much longer to start. Now that Gabriel arrived, the commanding officer, Sgt. Haysem, estimates that within 3 hours the troops will start entering the city.

Gabriel’s squad is comprised of five men, including himself. Harvey and Donald are twins from San Francisco, who managed to survive the flooding of the city by running with their family to the mountains nearby. They are the squad’s sharpshooters, most of the times splitting up from the rest to provide cover and intel from afar. They are almost identical in every way, and take turns between each mission on shooting and spotting.

Brad is the main gunner, usually going in first to every confrontation. He is a large, dark skinned and ruthless soldier with custom-made armor that makes him almost bulletproof. On one occasion a grenade exploded right next to his feet and all he lost was his small toe, leaving him with 3. Finally, Snare is the technician and the smartest one of the group, usually handling anything technological. However, he can still hold his own in a firefight and in fact might be the best shot other than the twins.

The group arrived at the camp in high noon, seeing the preparations at their peaks. Trucks were being unloaded constantly before clearing the way for more supplies to come, troops were landing at the airstrip and immediately taken to briefings, and the final checks on the unmanned drones were being made. Haysem points the squad into a large tent on the far side of the camp, and tells them he’ll be right there.

Gabriel enters the improvised command center to find men hard at work. It is mostly set up, but some displays are malfunctioning so technicians run around frantically, trying to figure out what’s wrong. The rest of the computers are manned by intelligence collectors, who attempt to hack the local Viking networks or intercept their communications. 

“Snare, looks like they could use your help here” Gabriel whispers, “they don’t seem to have a clue on how to fix those screens.”
“I’m sure they’ll figure this out, I fly for 13 hours to be a maintenance guy”

A tall man approaches the squad and introduces himself as Peter, the commanding intelligence officer, and leads them into a side room. 
“Come this way, Haysem will join us in a moment and we will begin”
The room has a large desk in the center with 7 seats around it. The squad sits down just as Haysem and Peter enter the room, who join them around the desk. The sergeant takes out a small device from his picket, presses a button and a huge hologram appears above the desk. He begins to speak.

“Alright, this is the city’s layout”

It is shaped like a square, quite small at around two kilometers on each side. There are a few tall buildings in the center, but the rest are private homes, no more than two stories tall.

“You can see that the city center sports a fell skyscrapers. Those were built during the war and can withstand a head on ICBM hit. As such, most of the important offices and documents are stored there. This makes the downtown our most important objective when  capturing the city, as it is likely that the Vikings have set up a command center in the top floors. The windows are made out of quasiglass, which means nothing can penetrate them without leveling the whole city as well, so out only option is to go in from the entrance, climbing up floor by floor”

“Can’t we go in from the top?” Interrupts Brad, “Going in from the bottom seems like a death trap”

“We wish there was another way, but the Vikings have reinforced the roof and prevented any access from it. In addition, getting up there means we have to transport the troops by helis, which would paint them as easy targets for the AA. Back on topic, your job will be to go in and assist the capturing of those towers.”

“Great, but what am I supposed to do? And my brother?” Shouts Donald, who realizes that there is no place for a sniper in this assault.

“Don’t worry, you two have a separate assignment.” Haysem once again presses a button on his remote, and the hologram shifts to the outskirts of the city.

“These are the ruins of a mansion. You probably heard about the code 4057, well this is where it originated from. Out scientist and his team went missing just as the Vikings attacked, and the area was hit directly by a drone. We suspect that the whole squad was killed, but you must retake the area and secure it to let our men uncover what was found yesterday. High Command suspects that the Vikings recaptured the city so quickly just because of that mansion, and the fact that it is heavily guarded is a testament that they’re right.”

“Wait, we’re not going alone, right?” asks Harvey.

“Of course not,” joins Peter, “You will lead 30 soldiers, giving orders from your spot and assisting the assault with suppressive fire. We also managed to get a few tanks from the front lines just for this operation. Is everything clear?”

The five soldiers looked at one another worryingly. While they always split up on their missions, they still are on the same assignment. This will be the first time that they truly separate ever since the squad was put together, and no one likes it. However, they all realize that this is a must, and that the twins will be of no use in storming the towers, so the all agree.

“Great” continues Haysem “we will leave for the towers in two hours. Harvey and Donald, you will start your attack an hour after we launch for the towers, so we will also serve as a distraction. Now, go outside and freshen up, we need all of you at your best. Dismissed!”

Cardiff. The last bastion of humanity. A grave for thousands

The War was finally over, ended with a mutual nuclear exchange and bombing run in the late 3990's that the world had seen a painful number of times in her past. Civilization, once holding on by a thread, was now a mere afterthought. After the other Celtic cities were bombed and burned by nuclear fire, the Party launched the remaining nuclear warheads in it's arsenal, triggering the ancient ruins of the Strategic Defense Initiative. America and Vikingland were destroyed within the hour, and Cardiff burned for a month due to the counterattack. 

The streets were calm and quiet. There is no life. Not even insects to pick at the skeletons left behind, or carrion birds to pick at the remnants of the dead crops. The Revolution's vast dream of reclaiming Earth ended with a quiet whimper on a Thursday evening.
The story of humanity ended with a long, painful chapter written in ash-polluted blood and tears.


==

It's over five hundred and sixty million years since that sad day, and the only remnants left behind are long-forgotten remnants of our mark on the planet, barely recognizable ruins like Mount Rushmore and the buried Viking nuclear submarines at the bottom of the ocean floor. 

But something remains.

Vaguely humanoid creatures huddle around one another in a cave, murmuring to themselves in a bestial, grunting language. They pause and freeze, focusing at the mouth of the cave. One of their own had returned, carrying a large broken-off stick with a raging flame on the wide end. 

He hoists the torch into the air and lets out a shrill howl of excitement. His clan joins him, hollering and howling in shock and excitement at the new discovery.

My life had no hope. No chance of reprieve or survival. As a male Viking child, there was only one path for my life to take; straight to the front line. From a young age, we were taught to be strong. Taught how to fight. Taught to have no fear, just undying loyalty to our nation. 

Those who survived the frequent nuclear blasts were the unlucky ones. At the age of 15, you were moved into a fighting force. Moved to the front lines. By this age, you were able to command, drive and fire our tanks. You enter the tanks a thousand miles from the very front, which is then sealed shut, entirely self-sufficient. This became your home for the next few days. And eventually, your coffin. 

The tanks were small, designed for two people. Designed for short time living only; the fundamental design hadn’t changed in hundreds of years. Easy to manufacture. Could hold their own against American or Celtic forces. Just about. But there size; they could hold with a degree of comfort two people. They could be controlled by two people with years of skill and training. Over the years, the age of being sent to the front had steadily decreased, greener and greener soldiers being sent to the front. The amount of training received had, over the years, become less and less. 

To amend this lack of training, the geniuses up the chain of command, decided that they could put three men in each tank. That this would be a sufficient substitute to years of training, testing and mental conditioning. They, unsurprisingly enough, were wrong. But nobody ever made it back, to tell of the idiocy of command’s idea. When you get into that tank, you do not leave. You trundle along, if lucky, fire your main gun a few times. Then die. Obliterated by shell fire or nuclear blast.

The tank’s interiors were sparse. There was a single bunk, very little room to manoeuvre if you are in by yourself. Let alone if you are sharing it with two boys, much the same as you, going off to die on the front.  Cabin fever very quickly set in. Tempers would fray. The atmosphere inside that metal box deteriorated quickly, soon becoming almost as bad as the political atmosphere of the three nations. You would soon hate your two companions, with every bone in your body. Only the ever present mile counter would keep you straight, constantly ticking off the miles travelled, counting towards your death. 

Inside those boxes, the food was bad. The air stank, which, while rich in oxygen was almost overbearing with the chemical purifiers they added in to cycle the air. There was the risk of a leak from your fuel cells, which could easily poison all three of you. The food was prone to spoiling fast, and while nutritious, tasted bland and encouraged nausea. And the chemical toilet…don’t get me started on the damned toilets. Overflowing faeces was the least of your worries with those toilets. 

Your outcome was dismal, if you were male, and born of the Viking lines. No hope. No chance of survival. Do not ask how they continued our race. Do not ask what happened if you were born female. We were separated at a young age, us into military training. Them, who knows. Certainly none of us. 

We were the unlucky ones. The ones whose lives would be thrown away. The ones with no names. The ones history will forget. For who is writing the history books? Certainly none of us. I am just another nameless Viking, dragged into the eternal war. I never asked for this. Never. 

As I write this, we are fifty miles from the killing floor. A few hours, until our death. The other two are piloting this machine and keeping watch. To our left, another tank. To our right, another tank. In front of us, tanks. Behind us, tanks. As far as the eye can see; tanks. I lie cramped in the bunk, quickly penning this. But nobody will ever read it. There will be chance. For by nightfall, all of us will be dead, obliterated. This leaf of paper will cease to exist. It is unfair. And I wish it weren’t so. But there is nothing I can do. Nothing I could ever do.

(Call me Agent 22, if you’d like.)  The only thing that’s important is the mission.  

How long have I been living behind enemy lines?  Long enough that I don’t remember what my actual home looks like.  I can’t see the faces of my real friends and family.  I don’t know if they are still alive.  All I see are the smiling faces of the people around me: how I hate them.  I am simply biding my time until I don't have to see their faces any more.  Don't have to hear their voices, listen to their songs or gag when I hear them pray.  Until then, I'm waiting.  How much longer isn't for me to say.

For five years, as a member of the People’s Security Force, I was on the Eastern Front and distinguished myself as a leader and a soldier.  I killed hundreds of Vikings and ‘Mericans in my time there.  It was my duty and pleasure to protect our way of life.  I didn’t care about peace: I cared about my family and, of course, for Lycerius.  

The Secret Police found my records and secured my transfer from the Lines to their ranks.  I spent 10 years as a member of the SP and have learned a lot about our enemies: more then I care to know.   I know how they speak, how they pray, how they make love, how they walk, eat and shit.  I have become one of them: I’ve become an American.  

For my mission, for my Supreme Commander, I have given up my love of Country and replaced it with foe-Patriotism.  I now look at the Stars and Cross with as much love in my eye as is in my heart for the Red ‘n Gold of my home land.  I speak ill of the ones that I truly love and, at times have had to take the lives of my own Countrymen to prove myself.  I hate it with all that I am but it is all for the greatest good: Victory.  

I just have to wait.  

Now, I find myself living and working close to one of their premier refineries.  Here they take all of the scrap metal that they can salvage and recycle it into useable material.  I have worked hard over the last 8 year here and they trust me.  I fought along side with most of them, when it was our time at the front or fighting off bands of raiding parties.  I have saved some of their lives and they have saved mine.  If only they knew who they were saving.  What I was prepared to do with the life that they rescued.  If only they knew that I was just biding me time.  Positioning myself to the proper place on the game board and waiting for the signal to make my final move.

Not many know what really happened after the Eternal War ended.  The Capital lies to us and tells us lies, but I know what really happened.

The Celts and Vikings completely destroyed each other 4142 A.D. The world was devastated. Anywhere that wasn't full of radiation from the war was uninhabitable swampland. The American government came up with a solution, to localize the people based on the area's main production, that way everyone would be able to support each other.

The Capital stood at the center of this new nation, with 13 districts around it like a clock.  Each district had its own specialty, from technology, to farming, even coal mining.  I live in the technology district, number 3. I work in a factory, building computer chips for the hovercraft that the government uses.  It's not a fun job, but I get paid decently.

Which brings me to the challenge: **Reach a stalemate or an end to The War purely by using ""renewable resources"" and make your people prosperous, plentiful and happy again.** 

This means: 

* no offshore platforms

* no coals, iron, gold, or glacier oil

* hardcore: no peat

I'd try it myself but I'm afraid it would take me out of circulation for the next few weeks and I really don't want that... also my alliance with the Americans always ends pretty quickly as relations deteriorate, which is a real hassle when it comes to moving units etc.

I couldn't replicate it perfectly(I even had to take some liberties with nationalities), but I tried. The 4 nations are the Dutch(closest to Vikings), the British(closest to Celts), the Americans, and the Iriquois(closest to Sioux). 

I, playing as the British, am allied with the Americans and the Dutch were allied with the Iriquois. The game was completely, aside from a small incident here or there, peaceful until the Information Age. I used Nukes on the Dutch, then brought a large Army in to clean up. By the time I had eliminated the Dutch, the Iriquois had researched missile defense, so I had to change up tactics. I took 2 cities from the Iriquois, but they took one back. But then I ran into the problem that has me in a stalemate. After defeating the Dutch, my nation has become huge, spanning roughly 70% of the entire map. As a result, I have reached my population limit and cant spawn huge armies all at once. I can't advance on the nearest Iriquois city because they have a smaller population and can spawn huge armies quickly. The Americans, however, are gaining ground on the Iriquois from the side opposite me. They have taken 2 cities(but there's no promise it will stay that way). Both I and the Americans have been bombing(with Stealth Bombers) Iriquois buildings, but they're pretty quick at rebuilding.

I came seeking resolution...  Possibly absolution...

If the Lycerius savegame file has been passed around, has *anyone* been able to break the deadlock?  Between the Vikings, Mericans, and the OC Celts?

Or, is it if you try to fix the world, diverting precious resources from the war effort, then any work will just be nuked, and either the Vikings or Mericans will overrun the OC Celts, losing the game?

So all three sides have no choice but to continue grinding all resources into building armies/tanks/nukes, lest they will be overrun?

Complete, and total stalemate?  Until the Sun goes red dwarf a few billion years from now?

I looked over every thread in this subreddit seeking if someone has broken the stalemate for the OC Celts, allowed them to squash the Vikings and Mericans, and actually start rebuilding the blasted, twisted, starving wasteland that world has become...

Anyone?  Anyone at all?

By J.D. Geist
[ Log: 13:30 May 2nd, 3991. Sector 5, New Wales]
  “This world in arms is not spending money alone.  It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children,” spoke an aged man, as a half burnt cigar smoldered between his fingers. 
“And I’m going to guess that’s another one of your beloved quotes Halifax?” snapped a younger man, his eyes rolling in annoyance. 
“It is,” replied Halifax calmly, “and one that damn near sums up our world, I don’t think even you can argue that? Can you Renault?” 
“Of course I can’t old man!, that would be like trying to argue that Earth’s not round. War sucks, ever since this November offensive started up in the North Front, rations have been low. Child starvation is back above 50% and you don’t even want to know how hard it was to get these smokes.”  Halifax did not respond immediately. Instead, he simple looked at Renault, his eyes fixed, not in anger over his friend’s remarks, but sadness.  He drew a long puff from his cigar. It was a decent blend nearly as the natural one he had sampled years ago. Halifax had to admit it was a kind favor to bring him one. It was kind of Renault to converse with a man like him at all. Finally, he opened his mouth to speak,
 “I’m not talking about the November offensive,” Renault titled his head in confusion, “I’m not talking about that or the Summer Raids or even the 715th Great Struggle, I am talking about everything, the very state of our world.” Renault’s eyes narrowed at this remark. He generally liked the old man despite his eccentricities, but comments like this always managed to find a way under his skin. Vague, and dangerously philosophic, they reminded him why Halifax was an outcast. Good comrades did not have time to ask such things, especially  not when the vile Vikings were attacking once again. The young man attempted to request explanation, but he was cut off, “This war, this eternal war, has destroyed our world. Tell me friend, would you believe that where we stand now was no coast but a great mountain named Snowdon. It was, before the great floods.” Renault’s mouth dropped. This was too far. He had heard stories about the World Before the War, bed time tales mothers used to soothe their children. He imagined they had some truth about them and he knew the world had been a kinder place before our enemies launched the first nukes centuries ago, but to know specific landforms; such information could have only one source.
 “Where did you learn that?” demanded Renault.
“In an old geography book  that has been re-transcribed from a text dated to the 2300s. Truly it is a gem of a find,” answered Halifax remaining strangely calm despite the growing air of tension in the room.
“ A book!” balked Renault, “ I thought you had given up illicit readings since the police last raided your place.” Renault’s voice was sharp but not hateful. Despite, his efforts to conceal it, his concern for the old man was evident, “If they found out about this… The Great Lycerius’s mercy can only be tested so far.”  Halifax extinguished his cigar and rose to his feet.
“I am a Preserver, a holder of lost knowledge and the true past. Like so many before me, I must learn and I must remember so these will not be forgotten.  This is my charge, and it cannot be abandoned,” replied to old man reciting the creed of his secret order. 
“Your Charge?” shouted Renault incredulously, “You really think it’s your charge to defy the party in times like these? The Preserves are a cult, rebels. The party will hunt you just like they hunt insurrectionists.” With those last words, Renault’s mind flashed through images of rebel corpses paraded across the news. He always found the thought of Celt killing Celt to be deplorable.  Granted, those men and women had risen against the Party and hurt the nation, but they had seen their children all die to feed soldiers and their supplies cut to build tanks. He often wondered if he would have done the same if he had been in their shoes. The Party had its faults, but whether they rose with guns or mere books, those who rose in defiance were always struck down. Halifax was a strange man, but he was also a good man. He had always been kind to him, sharing his few luxury rations and telling great tales and fables. Renault would not let endanger himself for such foolishness.  
“ Halifax, you need to stop this!”  he pleaded, “ A man your age wouldn’t last long on the front, and they would sure as hell cart you off if they found what you had been doing.”
“I’m not so sure that would be the case my young man, “chuckled Halifax, his dismissive laugh shocking Renault, “I can’t believe the wise Great Lycerius would waste such a precious resource as a Preserver. The party may never admit it, but they need us. They need what we know, and I would wager my life there are a few of my cult in the Party Councils. Knowledge, of all things including the past, is needed in war Renault. It is needed as much as  soldiers and bullets.” Just then the television sparked to life and the two men turned to view the official bulletin that had halted their debate.
As of 13:45 today, The Peoples Party has named Stanley Masters, High Advisor and Strategist, of our proud nations combined military. The High Advisor has already let troops to victory countless times and had already devised a  plan that will bring the Celtic People glorious victory. With the support our stalwart American allies and the continued guidance of our beloved defender and servant, The Great Lycerius, we had conqueror the wretched Viking hordes and finally claim our rightful place as lords of a peaceful world. Duty and courage my brothers and sisters, all honor to our people and its party!
The screen returned to its former blackness, but both Halifax and Renault remained transfixed. The newsreader was always fiery and optimistic even when outlining  the effects of the newest tragedy, but today’s announcement contained something new, something alien. It contained a true glimmer of hope. Did this new commander actually have a plan to win the war? Is such a thing even possible? Renault looked at Halifax as if to beg for some insight. The old man met his glance and answered, simply “I don’t know.” Victory, the word echoed in Renault’s mind. It had been chanted more times than he could count, but it was never more than a dream; a fantasy. The thought of victory and peace as a  reality was beyond comprehension. For a brief moment, Renault let his imagination drift off into these musing until he remembered their pervious conversation and jerked back to focus.
“Well even if we do finally win this war, it won’t matter for you if the police find out you haven’t abandoned your cult’s practices!” declared Renault . 
“Son, if we win, this ‘cult’ might be the only thing that matters. For victory to be complete we must rebuild, and the Preserver’s will hold the tools needed for this tasks. Besides Renault, I don’t really believe I am going to be turned in anytime soon.”
“And why not?” inquired Renault, “If anyone discovers what you’re doing there going to turn you in or face punishment themselves. Hell, I like you old man, but if you think I would face the prison brigades to keep your secret you’re…”
“Oh I severely doubt you betray me,” interrupted Hilfax laughing quietly.
“And why not?” barked Renault, his eyes narrowed weary of the meaning behind this last assertion.
“Because my friend if you condemn me, you condemn yourself. All those stories you gleefully listened to, those were not fables or legends, they were true. I have told you many things, volumes of ancient knowledge, and you have remembered them all. You are yourself now a master of history and guilty of the same crimes you accuse me of committing.  Renault, you are now a Preserver. Welcome to the Order.”

May 30, AD3975

I had a name once. A family. Friends in the millitary. I've been forced to leave it all behind; not suppress it, but forget it. I was told anything from my past that I try to keep can compromise the mission. It's been 142 days since my superiors deemed me worthy for the Celtic Infiltration Confederacy program. We had always heard of the CIC in the army. How if you showed any initiative above shooting your quota of 15 enemies a day, or told someone you knew how to read, you would be scooped up by CIC command and coerced into being a spy. Losing your past. Becoming the enemy. I had a name once. But after all this mental torture I couldn't tell you what is was if my life depended on it.

September 10, AD3975

I graduated the academy today. The bigwigs say I did so well on my torture tolerance and espionage tests that I have been promoted to CIC-02 and given my agent number. My new name is Agent 24E3220. I've been told to never forget this number, because it will be the only way for the mirrors over the Iron Wall to stay in contact with me. My fellow CIC-02's and I are being carted under the Wall on the secret underground railway our great leader Lycerius built centuries ago. They're all talking about how tomorrow is some kind of remembrance day for the Americans, and we're going to hit them where it hurts.

January 02, AD3976

I came home to my flat today with a familiar envelope in my mailbox. The local mirror had finally brought me an update on the American factories effected by the bio-bomb raid of the all cities by CIC-02 early last September. It would seem that the survivors and their families were spared no time or sympathy as the factory overseers were locking all doors in all factories during shift hours. Those left blind and crazed by the bio-bombs can be seen slaving right beside the newly employed children of the less-fortunate dead. All the while a cross hangs from every wall, every neck. From even Jesus was not subjugated to this much torture. This religion is disgusting. This country is disgusting.

June 09, AD3979

I've been keeping my journal updated less and less lately. Guard patrols on the streets have me behaving my best on the way to the way to the American War Information Centre where I've been re-employed with the help of my buddy 24E32913 and my skill with numbers. I crunch the war cost tank by tank, division by division. But that's not really why I am here. The president will be in town next week for a briefing on war bonds. I drew the shortest straw at the last CIC-02 meeting in that little old lady's basement last month, so it seems that I will be doing the briefing. But from the orders we received from CIC command, there wont be much briefing going on.

June 17, AD3979

What have I done.. Everything was going so well.. and then it all went to shit in seconds. Fucking 24E3554.. He was every CIC-02's brother. Their best contact with what was real to all of us, the old world.. And he got half of ring killed. Who would have thought he was a double agent, who would have thought he would shoot us all in the back. I was THIS FUCKING CLOSE. I had the presidents throat in my hands. 24E2115 and and that rat bastard 3554 were at the door waiting to quickly and quietly gun down any secret service who heard the scuffle. I grabbed for my knife to cut that pig's throat and heard the familiar whisper of the Silenced MK13 and sickening thud of a body hitting the ground. I turn to see 3554 standing over 2115's dead body with his gun aimed at my head. What the fuck was I going to do? My one chance to get rid of this religious tyrant and I fuck it because I didn't want my brain splattered on the wall. I had to duck. I fucking HAD TO! I let go and heard the bullet scream by as i ducked my head. I drew my pistol and shot that fucker in the head. Then ran up to his body and added a couple extra bullets for 2115. I tried to kill the president.. I really did. But I look over to see that the secret service we were expecting are picking him up off the floor. Bastards must have been in the ceiling the whole time, waiting for 3554 to waste us. What happened next was all a haze. The bullets. Running down the stairwell to the lobby. Seeing American soldiers on the side of the building gunning down CIC-02 agents, lined up, beaten and blindfolded. That rat 3554.. WE WERE HIS FUCKING BROTHERS. I just had to keep running, find a busy street corner, become a face in the crowd.. I could have killed him.. I could have killed him

In this theoretical world were every ounce of manpower, energy, and any other resource is solely dedicated to the war effort what could we expect 'normal' civilian life to be like? Well I can't assume it would be nice given the descriptions. If there is no education (something that seems highly likely due the famines, crime and pollution) there would be no discerning truth throughout any given government. No one could formulate their own ideals, feelings hopes. Society would stagnate and so would technological advancements. this plus the war scenario would halt any progression in terms of ideology. 

The human race would be doing nothing, it would be constantly returning to a horrific status quo. With no advancements and no way out what would happen to us? Would mass insurrection spread? 

Sadly I doubt it. The fact that education would be very difficult if not impossible means history would be destroyed. The reasons the war started are most likely lost to all. Whatever goals they once held have all dissipated as survival is the only goal now. Nuclear war has ravaged the land and destroyed stability leading all chances of peace totally out of the question. 

All of this has to be calculated with propaganda and government agendas for they will be the only leading source of intelligence. But this could lead to abuses, as alluded to in *'1984'*. Countries could claim whatever they wanted. (if you've ever seen The Doctor's Daughter"" the sixth episode of the fourth series you'll see the same situation occur)  They could say the War is all that's ever existed, or they could say it started only a few moments ago. Would anyone know? Would the Governments even know? Could people even question the militaristic authorities for the truth? 

This is the social and human dilemma of 'The Eternal War'. It isn't just man-power, it isn't who or how one leader will dominate. It is the fact that no peace or true freedom could exist in such a destroyed and corrupted world.

I noticed a flash in the sky. Not uncommon, the SDIs shooting down another nuke. Quickly thanking the gods and the wisdom of the True Sons, I idly wondered why they sent them any more- no nuke had landed in a city of the True Ones in thousands of years. Probably to remind us they can. 

A wave of whispered warning moved up the crowded yet silent street, jerking me back into reality. I hurriedly looked to the floor and murmured my prayers to the True Gods, and thanking their Sons for guiding us through the Eternal Conflict to our inevitable victory, as it must be against such heathens as the Americans with their Man God, their undying president, and worse still, the godless Celts.

As their chosen one walked among us, I was reminded of the day my son was chosen to bear the burden of leadership.
He was merely a few days old. On the day of the Choosing, the thousands of babes born in the last month from the surrounding area of living space were gathered in a temple, and laid before the True Sons' gaze. 

First, the betrayers and the liars, the tricksters and the thieves were rooted out and taken for culling. I was not worried at this point, as I knew no child of mine could be a vassal of The Trickster. After Loki's vile spawn were dealt with, a True Son stood before me and my child, still nameless, and gently lifted him from me. 

A hunger pang again jolted me to the present. Maybe it was the nature of my journey that made me so unfocused today. Wiping away a tear of joy at the memory, I continued down the silent highway, with thousands yet alone, to the temple.

My hunger persisted, yet I ignored it, as always. The gods made sure we had enough to eat, yet the lazy and the infidels stole it from us, meaning everyone had to go without. The True Sons had it worst, going for months without food, so we were told by their spokespeople. They did it for us, and the time had come for me to do something back for them. For the greater good of everyone, to save the realm of the godly from the evil.

I entered the temple, struck by reverence for the Mighty Ones. I walked towards the Statue of Thor, hundreds of metres tall. His hammer nearly touched the roof, held in position of great authority. Each god had his or her own statue, and each had different building at it's base, dealing with each aspect of life. Odin and his raven dealt with Matters of state- only the True sons went there. Loki and his serpent's tongue dealt with traitors and spies. I myself had turned in many, I remembered with pride.

 Thor and his hammer were for the glorious military. I knew my time had come to give everything for the gods. I would go into battle under their protection, and the many faced enemy would fall.

But suddenly, a great flash. It seemed to even leak through the very stone itself, it was so bright. I knew at once what had happened. The infidels had planted a nuclear device in the city. I felt a great rage course through my being that they would are defile such a holy place, as suddenly the the temple began to come crashing down around me. The statues fell slowly to the floor and as Thor's hammer came down, my final thoughts were that I would be in a better place, soon.

A reply to the Celtic chairman Lycerius

Year of our Thor AD3991 June 12th

Transcript as follows:

Deputies, men of the Norse!

The so called leader of the Celtic nation has addressed a telegram to me, with the curious contents of which you are already familiar.  Before I, the addressee, actually received this document, the rest of the world had already been informed of it by radio and satellite reports, and numerous commentaries in the organs of the communist world press had already profusely enlightened us as to the fact that this telegram was a very skillful tactical document, designed to impose upon the states, in which the people govern, the responsibility for the warlike measures adopted by his criminal communistic administration.

In view of these facts I decided to summon the Norse High Assembly so that you, gentlemen, might have an opportunity of hearing my answer first and of either confirming that answer or rejecting it.  But in addition, I considered it desirable to keep to the method of procedure initiated by chairman Lycerius and, for my part, to inform the rest of the world of my answer in our way.

The theocratic Norse nation wants peace because of its fundamental convictions.  And it wants peace also owing to the realization of the simple primitive fact that no war would be likely essentially to alter the distress in our world...  The principal effect of every war is to destroy the flower of the nation...  The Norse nation needs peace and desires peace!

Whoever lights the torch of war can wish for nothing but chaos.  We, however, live in our firm conviction our times will see not the decline but the renaissance of the North.  It is our proud hope and our unshakeable belief Nordland can make an imperishable contribution to this great work.

We are all proud of God's powerful aid. We have become once more true Norsemen!

The world will not help, the people must help themselves. Its own strength is the source of life. That strength the almighty has given us to use; that in it and through it, we may wage the battle of our life. The others in the past years have not had the blessing of the almighty - of him who in the last resort, whatever man may do, holds in his hands the final decision. Lord Thor, let us never hesitate or play the coward.

Struggle is the father of all things. It is not by the principles of humanity that man lives or is able to preserve himself above the animal world, but solely by means of the most brutal struggle. If you do not fight, life will never be won.

If today I stand here as a revolutionary, it is as a revolutionary against the revolution!

Now, if Mr. Lycerius concludes that our agreement with him at Heliopolis has been rendered null and void through a breach on our part, then we shall take cognizance of the fact and proceed accordingly. He seemed such a nice schoolboy, I thought would give him my autograph as a souvenir.

Lycerius is the most bloodthirsty or amateurish strategist in history...  For thousands of years this man has been chasing around the map like a madman in search of something that he could set on fire...  As a soldier he is a bad politician and as a politician is an equally bad soldier.  The gift Mr. Lycerius possesses is the gift to lie with pious expression on his face and to distort the truth until finally glorious victories are made out of the most terrible defeats.  Lycerius, one of the most hopeless dabblers in strategy, thus managed to lose two theaters of war [Nordland and the Americas] at one single blow.  In any other country he would be court-martialed.  His abnormal state of mind can only be explained as symptomatic either of a paralytic disease or of a drunkard's ravings.

The first result, apart from serving the internal political purposes of the communist governments is the spreading of a nervous hysteria which even makes the landing of Martians seem possible.  The real purpose, however, is to prepare the public opinion to regard the Celtic encirclement policy as necessary and, consequently, to support it, should the worst come to worst.

The Nordic people, on the other hand, can go about their business with perfect tranquility.  Their frontiers are guarded by the best army in the history of Nordland.  The sky is protected by the most powerful air and missile fleet, and our coasts are rendered unassailable by any enemy power.  In the west, the strongest defensive work of all times has been built.

But the deciding factors are the unity of the Norse Nation as a whole, the confidence of all Norsemen in one another and in their fighting forces and - if I may say so - the faith in our leadership through Thor.

Now. As I mentioned at the beginning, on August 15th, 3991, - the world was informed of the contents of a telegram which I myself did not see until later.  It is difficult to classify this document or to place it in any known category.  I will, therefore attempt, Gentlemen, to present to you - and so to the whole Nordic people, an analysis of the contents of this amazing document and in your name and the name of the Norse people to give the appropriate answers for it.

I.

Mr. Lycerius states that the world is plainly moving towards the moment when this situation must end in catastrophe unless a rational way of guiding events is found.

He also declares that I have repeatedly asserted that I and the Nordic people have no desire for war and that if this is true, there need be no war.

Answer: I should like to point out in the first place that I have not waged any war but simple defense; in the second, that for years I have expressed my abhorrence of war and, no less, of warmongers; and thirdly, that I do not know for what purpose I should wage a war at all. To defend oneself is to wage peace.

I would appreciate if Mr. Lycerius would give me some explanation in this regard.

II.

Mr. Lycerius says further that he does not speak from selfishness, fear, or weakness, but with the voice of strength and friendship for mankind.

Answer:  If this voice of strength and friendship for mankind had been raised by the Celtic nation at the proper time, and particularly if it had any practical value, then at least that treat which was to become the source of the direst derangement of humanity and history, the Dictate of Heliopolis, could have been prevented.

III.  

Mr. Lycerius stated in conclusion that the heads of all great governments are in this hour responsible for the fate of humanity and that they cannot fail to hear the prayers of their peoples to be protected from the foreseeable chaos of war.  And I, too, would be held accountable for this.

Answer: Mr. Lycerius, I fully understand that the vastness of your nation and the immense wealth of your country allows you to feel responsible for the history of the whole world and for the fate of all peoples. My sphere, Mr. Chairman, is considerably smaller and more modest.  You have a modest population on countless square kilometers.  You possess a country with enormous riches, all mineral resources, fertile enough to feed half the planet and provide them with every necessity.

I took over the leadership of a nation which was faced by complete ruin thanks to its trust in the promises of the outside world and to the evil government led astray from Thor.  In this state are roughly 140 people to each square kilometer - not 15 as in the Celtic lands.  The fertility of our country cannot be compared with that of yours.  We are beset by swamps, and lack numerous minerals which nature has bestowed on you in unlimited quantities.

When I took power, this nation was on its knees.  I have succeeded in finding useful work once more for all unemployed who are so close to our hearts, in keeping the Nordic peasant on his soil in spite of all difficulties and in saving it for him; in causing Norse trade to flourish once again; and in promoting transportation to the utmost.

To protect them against the threats of the outside world, I have not only united the Nordic people politically, but also rearmed them.  I have likewise endeavored to rid them of the Heliopolis treaty, page by page, which contain the vilest oppression which has ever been inflicted on men and nations.

This I have done, Mr. Lycerius, though twenty-one years ago, I was an unkown worker and soldier of my people, by my own energy, and can therefore claim a place in history among those men who have done the utmost that can be fairly and justly demanded from a single individual.

It is your good fortune to sustain scarcely fifteen people per square kilometer in your country.  At your disposal are the most abundant natural resources in the world.  Your country is so vast and your fields so fertile, that you can insure for each individual Celt at least ten times more of the good things in life than is possible in Nordland.  Nature has at least given you the opportunity to do this.

To conclude, the man who has no sense of history, is like a man who has no ears and eyes. Never forget that the most sacred right on this earth is man's right to have the earth to till with his own hands, the most sacred sacrifice the blood that a man sheds for this earth.

We, therefore, understand that lost land will never be won back by solemn appeals to God, nor by hopes in toothless negotiations, but by force of arms.  What we have to fight for is the freedom and independence of the our land, so that our people may be enabled to fulfill the mission assigned to it by the creator.  

Your sword will become our plow, and from the tears of war the daily bread of future generations will grow.

So say we.

If I die here, will it matter? 

So many have died in the bogs, awash in hot rads from centuries old fallout. Gunned down, killed by shelling, starvation, disease, and the ever present radiation. The Cumanach Iberian State, our motherland and our stern protector, has sent us to this uninhabitable badland to hold the line against our wretched foes, the United American Combine and the Neo-Viking Moot.

That is, at least, what we are told. I have been here for...I don't know how long. The years have dragged on since I was conscripted, and blurred while being shuttled between one festering front line to the next. I have fought on every border that we still have, and they all look the same. The same stinking marsh, the same flooded and eternally collapsing earthworks, the same desperate and despondent soldiers. The only time anyone snaps to attention is when a commissar stomps by.

These men want nothing more than to survive their rotation and move back to the rear echelon, and hopefully fulfill their conscription term and go home. They hope in vain. If they are rotated off the line, then they will be used in civil protection and insurgent suppression operations. That is much worse than the line. There, you have to raid houses, stop pedestrians, and walk patrols in restive areas. Light duty, until the insurgents drop a man in the street with sniper fire. Not a kill shot though, oh no. They only maim him, so he's screaming and bleeding out in the street, calling for his buddies to help him. But they don't, they know that's what the sniper wants. Their friend's screams demoralize them, and if any of them are dumb enough to take the bait and try to drag him back into cover, the sniper will drop them too. Or they'll be patrolling a street or guarding an outpost when a car bomb goes off and takes out half the block, leaving human beings in pieces all over the street. Or they trip over a piece of rubble in the warrens of the proles hab-blocks, and a nail-bomb soaked in rat poison goes off in their face.

No. Better on the line. There, at least, the enemy isn't your own countrymen, sick of pointless war waged by a brutal government that takes your sons to die in battle and leaves your daughters to die of hunger and plague. On the line, you know who your enemy is, and the gunfire only comes from one direction.

Usually; can't forget the commissars.

Okay let's state the obvious so that's out of the way:

* The Vikings are incompetent an we have no option but to take them out.

* The Americans seem somewhat reasonable

* We don't know the possible ways to win but it's safe to assume that domination is the only option.

**Celts Winning**

* Celts make treaty with Americans, so less pressure on the front line is needed allowing for granary's and farms to be built. After said farms are made added pressure to the front line of the vikings is an option. After vikings are finished diplomatic win could come through the Americans (If that is an option) otherwise they could use their open borders to nuke the Americans to shit. 

* Americans seem like the weakest of the big three so flanking them and nuking them or just overtaking they're civilization and using their resources and superior land positioning to have a much bigger front line. This would stress the vikings resources by having to face a 2:1 ratio of units. Keep hittin em' hard until you're superior resources prevails.

**Vikings Win**

* They take over weak Americans and death for the celst would be imminent.

* Celts focus too much on farming and the vikings are ale to march through the frontline. 

**Americans**

* I don't really see them as a major contender, and can't imagine them having the strength to get by the Vikings or Celts.

What are you're guys thoughts? It seems like this is mostly a war between the Vikings and Celts. If anyone wanted to draw war maps detailing what they think Celts or anyone could do that would be awesome. I'm newer to the Civ games so I don't know too much about Civ II.

Here's the deal, I'm trying to write a story and I want to create a world as realistic as possible within it. The tricky thing with the story is that it takes place about 300 years in the future, after the your run-of-the-mill apocalyptic scenario of post-nuclear wasteland, 95% of humanity wiped out, most of the world inhabitable. 

Now, the human race is a resilient one and there's still that 5% that's striving on. Of course between all the rape, cannibalism, and murder for a fresher pair of socks, it's not the greatest place to strive but it is slowly starting to settle through this growing clan that is sort of laying down the law and building settlements for better or for worse.

I know the CivII game happens in a much more distant future, but I couldn't possibly wrapped my head around that far in the future. I'm not a great writer so I'm trying to stick to something that's somewhat approachable and even 300 years in the future is difficult to properly imagine. So my hope is that some of you can make suggestions to help me flesh out the best post-apocalyptic world that you would believe in. Any suggestions or help, about any aspect of such a life, is greatly appreciated, even just reading this boring mess is already much appreciated, thank you.

TL;DR: I am looking to build a world where the apocalypse has come and gone and 300 years have passed, got suggestions?

PS: I tried the Post-Apocalypse sub-reddit before this one and, quite appropriately, it has been a wasteland for the past 8 months and seeing how this game sparked so much creativity from many people on this sub-reddit, I thought I could selfishly ask for some of it to be sprinkled on the world I'm trying to put out.

Our gray uniforms slowly turn brown as well and soon, only our yellow helmet with the red star continue to shine through the gloom of the green mist, brown soil, and gray uniforms and vehicles. The sweat begins to slowly grow from a trickle of the forehead to a flood that only comes to refill the swamp that we try to drain.

""Casualities are impossible to accurately estimate. but are considered to be at least a 90 % decrease in world population in the first years of the War alone, from 150 million to 10-15 million, according to surviving records from the 23rd Century. Since then, the population growth has stagnated at the latter number. The few scientists remaining estimate, given the increased birthrate (hovering around 3 children per woman, due to most women first giving birth very early, and many women dieing of childbirth, radioactive waste, and so on) that casualties annually hover around 500.000 soldiers, or about 3 % of the world population. Multiplying that number by 1690 (the first ten years of the War discounted, as they were the cataclysmic years that led to the 90 % decrease) means that a total of 845 million people have perished during the time. Adding 140 million from the first ten years gives a estimate of 985 million casualities since the start of the war in 2291.""

The most striking feature of The Eternal War is the idea of perpetual **nuclear** war. This is really odd as originally a nuclear war would be a very large scale but very quick exchange of nukes. In this case nukes are used very often in a more conventional sense of warfare and this brings up many questions. 

First, what effect does this have on the environment? Lycerius already mention that there'd been several nuclear winters but the effects of constant nuclear barrage on certain areas would mean that a recovery from the nuclear fallout would be impossible. 

Second, how are the factions manufacturing nuclear weapons? After a 1700 year long war it's likely that the three factions will have lost a lot of their scientific capabilities in addition to the scarcity of resources which would result in manufacturing nukes being very difficult (especially at the rate they're being used).

Lycerius' screenshots shot there's aprox. 15 million people in the world by 3991. This is really surprising for several reasons.

One, the fallout from a millennia long nuclear war would reduce the population size dramatically (in addition to almost certain mutations in human genes which would probably result in a proportion of people have birth defects further reducing the population size).

Two, the war has left most of the world as an irradiated swamp so this poses the question how do 15 million people eat? The only source of food in such a hostile environment would probably be insects and maybe some basic form of plant (moss?). The lack of food and resources should've really killed all of mankind so I can only assume that the factions are very resourceful.

Lastly, the actual conflict would kill off most of the male population (if the rate of military production is this high). This would cause two things. First, there'd be a very uneven ratio between men to women with men having a much shorter life expectancy. Second unless men have children at a very young age (late teens at least) the population would be decreasing because of the lack of men to have children with the out of proportion female populace.",,False,,t5_2ua25,False,,,True,t3_uzn3z,http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/uzn3z/problems_with_the_eternal_wars_universe/,

The caves are haunted.

He sat alone in the darkness, his heart still racing. The cool dank air had a pungent odor but his lungs screamed for it. He inhaled and exhaled rapidly, a hard rhythm like the muffled shuffle of the bare feet that had chased him. He knew they would not follow him here. Their fear was too great.

The caves are haunted.

There was protection here, in this labyrinth of concrete and steel. Even the screams above were muffled by the thick ceiling. They sounded faint and distant, though he knew he sat only a hundred feet and a few cracked, mossy steps away from the slaughter.

The Kelta would never follow him here, certain of his inevitable death in the caves. He was safe for a few hours until their raiding party moved on. Cinnati was a wasteland, a mountain of broken concrete, bent steel, and shattered bricks. The raiders would ravish their feminine spoils and offer the burnt flesh of the men to their god, Soshul. Inevitably, Soshul would go hungry as the raiders would use the charred flesh to satisfy their most pressing appetite. The Kernul (the cognomen used by all Kelta raiding chieftains who disavowed any other name on their ascendency to that exalted station) would then mark a concrete slab with the knotted cords and cross of the Kelta, declaring Cinnati annexed by the Kelta Soshulist Republik. The raiders would then move on, probably south to the swampy hills of the Kentuck.

The caves are haunted.

The thought again crossed his mind as his breathing quieted and his eyes adjusted to the darkness. He could see thick, straight shapes ahead of him; a line of evenly-spaced robust guardians that held the ceiling in place for untold centuries. They stood burdened in tribute to the long-forgotten ancestors who had constructed the caves. For a moment, he wondered how strong the ancients must have been to carve this voluminous cavern into the earth and place this line of Atlases to hold up the great weight of the mountain of Cinnati. Why would they build this, he wondered? Did the ancients flee to these tunnels when the sun god crumbled their 'towers to the sky' into the mound of Cinnati Mountain? What amazing relics of ancient hubris could he find in these caves, abandoned for centuries?

His people weren't primitive. Though they lived migratory lives, surviving off hunting and foraging through the remnants of destroyed cities, they were part of the proud Usa Confederation, heirs to the ancients. Though he had never gone further than the twin settlements of Indi and Apolis, he knew far to the west were great cities like Omaha, untouched by the ancient wrath of the sun god. When he was a child, he saw the might of the Confederation: giant silent beings, hairless metal skulls, only steely eyes peering through gas masks. Known as the 'Police' for their distinctive clear shields emblazoned with that name, they marched through Wrightpatt many years ago, a phalanx armed with an assortment of weapons from shovels to spears (railroad spikes attached to long lead pipes). 

Intimidation was their strength. The Confederation Police were bogeymen to enemies and Usa citizens alike. While the Kelta raiders armored themselves with random scavenged pieces of metal, the Police wore the equipment of the ancients. While their hulking vehicles and rifles had fallen into disuse several decades before with the paucity of fuel and viable ammunition, their millennia-old masks, shields, and armor remained in pristine condition; a testament to the Confederation's status as heir to the ancients.

But there were no Police here to kill the hated Kelta raiders who pillaged above. They had not been seen in the Ohio for over two decades, despite repeated Kelta intrusions. Many believed that the sun god had returned after centuries and snuffed out Omaha in a flash of light, as he had done ancient Cinnati. The Confederation did not exist, they said, and the known world would descend into the savagery and barbarity of the Kelta Soshulists.

The caves are haunted.

His subconscious repeated the fearful mantra as he sat alone in the darkness. He dared not venture into the dank abyss, superstition eclipsing his curiosity. The cave was silent now, as not even the savages above could be heard. He wondered if they would notice his small frame running to safety amid the concrete slabs above. He couldn't stay down here much longer. The caves are haunted.

He touched his wet brow, noticing his hand trembling. His eyes darted from column to column, wary of a creature emerging from behind the concrete. The caves are haunted. He stood as his heart raced. The caves are haunted. He turned to the cave's entrance, a few dozen feet away. Surely the Kelta would not be monitoring the entrance. There is no sense in remaining in this cursed cave. The caves are haunted.

He darted for the entrance, tripping over the broken steps. As a sting of pain crossed his face and blood entered his mouth, he hobbled into the bright light above. He knew the Kelta heard him. He knew the Kelta were picking up their weapons. He could hear the rattle of their armor and the shuffle of their bare feet. He ran. The caves are haunted.

Due to previously mentioned reasons, I do find it disturbingly eerie to notice all the similarities between the novel 1984 and the Eternal War.

I always thought Orwell was right, but only about Soviet Union and (more or less) today's China and North Korea. And in the ""Western World"" (South Korea, Taiwan and Japan included), Huxley was more accurate and correct about his fears. If you don't agree, I could elaborate, but this post might get way too long to explain everything. That's why I summoned the infographic up there, so bear with me, but you're welcome to start any debate.

So I always thought Huxley was right about where the human civilization is headed, until I saw this Eternal War. What if Huxley and Orwell were BOTH right, just not at the same time ? Although I do not think the world will be united into a single huge country, as Huxley suggested, but what if we are currently ""enjoying"" world that is ill-fated to become a Huxleyan dystopia, until the depletion of resources and useful land, then an Orwellian dystopia takes over ?

It chimed reassuringly. The corner of his lip twitched. He was a Celt, a commander of the Liberation, a proud son of the Old Democracy and the New Reasoned Order. No place in his brain for empty ritual. 

""Sparta's 300 years dead,"" he told himself. ""No more fallout in this plaza. No ghosts, no radghouls, no vampires, no gods."" 

He tapped the dosim once more before he settled back against the crumbled wall to wait. 

Four hours later, footfalls awakened him from what he told himself wasn't a light nap. A dozen Greek sheltermen, pale as the moon, leading a bent old man of fifty. His clouded eyes were blind but somehow fixed on Macheath as they approached. 

One of the sheltermen muttered in the old man's ear. He sighed. 

""Ceannasaí, we were promised medicines. Each of these men commands a shelter of seven families."" 

""I apologize, Archon."" Macheath bowed. ""Bad tidestorms this spring, and auroras cut off the signal from the old satellites above the Trashbelt. A storm came in with no warning, wiped out four warehouses on the west side of the Mornos.""

The Archon narrowed his eyes. They both knew those warehouses stood. ""All the medicines lost, I assume.""

""Everything gone. We'll send out salvage parties tomorrow, but I expect they'll find nothing.""

The Archon nodded. ""A pity there'll be no sign of our agreement."" 

The subtext was painfully clear. The Greeks would have their price, but no acknowledgment of their existence. They were inconvenient ghosts and neither Celtania nor America would openly ally with them, no more than with a flock of birds or a wolf pack. 

Macheath sighed. ""While I can therefore promise you nothing, I can promise that anything you offer might improve your standing. And talks of alliance might be reopened in the spring."" 

The Archon scratched his chin. ""I await that day in joy. For now..."" He gestured, and a shelterman came forward with a binder that still smelled of fresh toner. ""Our hackers broke into an unprotected corner of the Athens municipal network. Yours might exploit this with more success."" 

Macheath took it. It was another gambit - the Americans always left backdoors to unimportant systems open to the hedge hackers of the shelters, as practice for their counterhack novices - but the old forms had to be followed. He bowed again. 

""Many thanks, Archon. Until next month.""

The Archon smiled sadly. ""You may return. I will not. Too many years of Greek dust. It poisons us."" A flash of something crossed his face. ""And someday you,"" he hissed. Recovering his cool exterior, the Archon hobbled away. 

Macheath turned to go. He would not report the old man's insult. The least he could do. But something about it chilled him. He tapped his dosim a last time. It chirped again, green numerals flashing. 

""A proud son of the Old Democracy,"" he chuckled, and began the long walk back to the Mornos...

Once I mastered this I moved on to civ3, as I have a land slide victory in every game.  

You build cities one square away from each other, ideally connecting 4 cities with each individual road you build.  Your focus is to build cities, and more cities, and get trade as soon as possible (for caravans).  

Greeks are the best civ as Hopolite give your the defense you need against the AI that starts with a huge advantage.

1. This eliminates the need to defend each city, as only the outer ring need defensive units, and you can easily shuttle an army where it's needed.  Less time spent on military units, more on settlers for more cities.

2. While you take an early technology hit, you quickly out produce opponents because of the extra food/shield tile in each city center.  Against the AI soon you can afford to buy their technology, or acquire it with conquest.

3. By about city 15-16, your opponents have 8-10, which may be bigger in population, but you are outproducing on food/shield/commerce because of lower corruption and time spent on religious buildings.

5. Each city no longer needs a military unit for defense, allowing more free unit maintenance for attacks.  Higher city count means more free unit support.

6. Smaller cities do not require nearly as many improvements, greatly lowering late game maintenance costs and maximizing the value of ""affects all city"" improvements such as the Pyramids.

7.  Once you have a decent base, you build 1-2 ""super cities"", ideally on the coast with a few good sea resources and build wonders in them via huge caravan production base.  Try to give these as many open tiles as possible to maximize city only wonders.

8. I usually keep a the starting government (depo) until democracy because you can sacrifice city population to build caravans, which is the fastest way to build wonders

The very idea that all our engineers can do is maintain our roads for the solitary goal of allowing us to move our tanks forward is not what they meant for this world to be.

So why are you, our freshly minted front line, to be marched out to war while your family suffers from famine?  Why should good men traverse this deadly landscape to mine more uranium so that another can place a device that will unleash hell itself upon another's shell of a city?

""Over here"" he says through his mask. Its been 5 days now, and our unit was close to our quarry. This isn't any of the fronts. Soldiers usually don't live to be as old as I am. We are public security, we patrol the insides of America. 
Their mission was to track a gang of savages who have hit supply caravans. Then as quickly as they hit, they disappear, back into the wastes they came from, in the territory even we ignore. Historically, they were called the 'Sioux', but we now call them the savages. Legend says they used to be as advanced as we are, but legends are for children. From what i hear, these barbarians eat their own children, and do far worst to our people. And now here I am, tracking them down in their own land.

""Hey Captain Clendrck, look"" says my Lt Ugyr, while pointing at a fire. We all gather behind the ridge as I survey the area with my scope. I see 5 young men, dark skinned, naked, with ceremonial markings on their bodies. Beside them are multiple containers, mostly army rations, and a few stolen military weapons. ""Its them! They're right there"" said Ugyr. ""From what I see, we outnumber them 3-1 Clendrck, what's the order?"" I give the order to surround them and close in. We make it to the makeshift camp in stealth, and I give the order to attack. BAM! Our sniper takes the head clean off one of them, and the remaining 4 immediately cower. 
We move in, weapons drawn, and secure the area. After checking all the supplies, I move to interrogate our prisoners. The savages aren't known for being fluent in our language, but I figured it was only just to let them have a few last words before we processed them. 

We tied them up next to the disarmed weaponry we recovered. The whole time, they have been moaning in their incoherent dribble. As I get closer to them, I notice something was off. ""Ugyr"" i say ""How many times in the past have you seen a savage?"" ""Seen the drawings in the old manuals, first time seeing a real one boss"". I approach one of them, and i touch his markings, the paint rubs off on my hands. Then I look in his eyes, his deep blue eyes. Eyes as deep as the horror i felt in the pit of my stomach when i realized my error. Before i could articulate my thoughts, i hear a scream. I look up, to see the body of our sniper falling from the ridge he was perched. Then I heard the warcries. We were set up, the 'savages' we captured were people from the supply caravan dressed to look the part. And all around me were the Sioux i was hunting. 

We fought, we fought like rabid beasts. For every one we put down, 4 more came to replace him. All the while men were falling next to me every minute. I threw granades at whole clusters only to have them rise back up. Men kept falling, to rocks, to spears, to arrows. We were better equipped, but our armor meant nothing to the endless barrage. I take a spear to the arm, and collapse. As i lay face first I hear the screams around me, and the gunshots continue. I listen until I can only hear Ugyr and his rifle. Then i hear a scream and a thud. It was over. 

Soon i feel the vibration of the scurrying of the scavengers. Taking the guns and ammo from my men. Then i sense i pair of feet stop at me. ""Takuni Slolye oniya"" said a voice. Then i feel hands pulling me upright. I see roughly 50 individuals staring at me. I look around and I see the mutilated corpses of my crew. Naked and in a pile. I examine the eyes looking at me, I see how they're already dividing my gear in their eyes. Then one of them approaches me. A big guy, bigger than even our elite soldiers. This was a man who did not know what starving meant. His imposing appearance almost reaffirmed the cannibal stories I've heard. He looked down on me, smiling. He reached for his dagger then gestured at me. ""Ehakeke Niya"" he said while raising his weapon ""Te!"" 

A soldier doesn't live to be as old and wise as I was. On the front lines, you'd be lucky to last a week. But behind the lines, there are always a few surprises. I found that out today, as this savage sunk his knife deep in my neck. But ya know what? I made sure he learned something too. He learned never shank the guy who was throwing grenades at your people before emptying his hands cus he might still be clutching a live one. He also learned not to do this in front of a small stockpile of ammunition.

The war has had its losses on me personally. The bombs, always falling.. My wife and child reduced to ash... What had this world come to? I have heard ancient tales of peace across the world, the things I would give to raise my family in times long past. I just hope we will one day prevail and turn the tide of this war for the better. 

I have just received word from command that the Americans are launching a counter attack on my squads position... My brothers in bravo company have already seen their end by the hands of nuclear weaponry and I fear we are next. I just hope we live to see the light of day. This is it. The bombs have been launched. Our anti warhead platforms have already been destroyed. I can now hear the eerie wail of the bombs on my position.. This is it then.

Like the first mod, I made a series of new civilizations, but to add to that I made a few policy tree changes, added twenty two new units and fifty five new buildings.

While I'm not sure there is as much demand for an Eternal War mod as their used to be, I can use what I learned on World War 2 to fix some of the lingering errors with the Eternal War, although I probably will not be going through and replacing all the units and buildings.

That's how I like to refer to my Archiver/Scavenger nanites. No good scraps this time, but some decent information. Memories. Such intriguing uploads. Always love to bide my time while reading over these. 

It must have been close to approximately eight millenia ago when I underwent my ""great nanotech overhaul"". Nanobots streamed over and throughout every millimeter of my body. It was quite a disconcerting experience. The entire process all but wiped out my prior identity completely. I believe it was meant to make me into a more efficient field surgeon. Or perhaps it was so I could retain more information as an engineer? The purpose of the operation escapes me. Too many other identities uploaded within my memory buffer cloud events of that distant past. In any case, it's all irrelevant. What is relevant is what happened within that year of initial testing and debugging. The laboratory where I was stationed suffered an unfortunate and catastrophic nuclear strike. I, alone, survived. 

Fearful for a repeat of this incident, I escaped. It was during these initial wanderings that I discovered the extent at which I had been enhanced. My nano-injections provide me with the capability of drawing moisture out of the very air which surrounds me and, thus, keep me hydrated. Additionally, using this same technique, they are able to provide me sustenance from practically any material I ingest, including soil. So, virtually, I have been rendered immortal. I reiterate the word ""virtually"" as I am certain an attack of sufficient enough damage, such as a direct nuclear strike on my body, could render me deceased. Obviously, I have not tested this theory firsthand.

It was also during these initial wanderings that I discovered the residence which I inhabit to this very day. After several hundred miles of traveling I happened upon the mouth of this cavern. Deciding upon this place as providing adequate enough protection, I investigated further inside. What I found was baffling. After proceeding thru an initial area of natural cave formations, which stretched labyrinthine for miles thru the earth, I found one of the tunnels led into an obviously artificial cave system. These caves had been designed for a specific purpose and to service certain people. What this purpose was and who these people were, both were a complete mystery to me. There was no evidence of either contained within. Instead, the interface system simply contained instructions on the cavern's operation. The entire artificial cavern system used the Earth's mantle, which apparently is quite adjacent to the system, in order to provide power for the cavern's operation. 

Aside from all the necessary life-support systems and basic amenities, the cavern apparently served two purposes. First, it is capable of providing a never-ending supply of nanites. What the initial purpose of these nanites was, I can not say. I have, instead, programmed them for my own ends, which is serving towards the cavern's second purpose: complete historical cataloging. The memory banks contained here already had an immensely thorough catalog of Earth's history dating back to prehistoric times. It was most impressive. So I knew instantly I had a purpose for my newfound abilities. I set forth production on history cataloging nanites, Archivers, and historical artifact recovering nanites, Scavengers. 

They provided me with a very detailed history of the Celtic-Viking-American War. Very fascinating. However, that war has long been dead. Victory was assured by the cunning and underhanded techniques used by Celtics. Truces were made and broken. Empires fell and entire civilizations were wiped out. Genocide is nothing new to our people. However, it ensured peace. It gave the people prosperity. 

I, however, still dwell within my cavern. For I alone can read the signs. I know of our history and our behaviors. Its all but an illusion. We're dawning upon the 11th millenium and, appropriately, a new era of war. Tensions are rising on the surface once again and, when combat does break out, this war will be the bloodiest this planet has ever seen.

Tonight, I think it is important for us to take a moment to remember our past.  Of why we must fight.  

It was 2000 years ago.  Mankind was a cesspool of pride and decadence.  They spat in the face of God every day of their lives; and brothers and sisters, they had forgotten Sodom and Gomorrah.  They had forgotten the God of old.  And so God in his infinite kindness, cast down his waters onto the earth. He purged the land of the sinful and the unfaithful.  It was through our glorious leader that we were spared!  He heard the voice of God, and as the waters rose, steered us away from the villainy of  science and into the light of the Lord.

But the Devil does not die so easily.  He found his allies in the Vikings.  He sent his demons to lead them astray.  He gave them to his spawn: the antichrist.

The Celts are another matter.  They seek the continue with the decadence and hubris that brought down Gods wrath in the first place.  They have refused God's light, and for that they too must be ended, lest God be forced to purge even the Faithful from the earth.

Brothers and Sisters, I know you have heard this story, but I was reminded by one of my children that sometimes we must remind them why we fight.  One of my wives woke me up because my daughter by her, who is three, had wondered where he brother had gone.  I had to explain to her that he had gone to take God's Purifying flames to the heathens.  That this is God's will for all men: that all Godly men serve Him as Purifiers.  Only by burning the bodies of the corrupt can we free the souls of the Damned of their taint.  I then told her that God's place for a woman is to serve Man: as a worker to equip God's Purifiers, as wives to serve their husband, and as mother to his soldiers.  A woman's job is much harder, but that is God's will.  

And so I leave you for the night brothers and sisters.  But I ask that you teach this hard message to your children.  It is vital they know why we fight.  For the hearth of our Lord and his purifying flames.  For our homes and family.  For our country, this bright spot of light in a world tainted by the Devil and man.  For this we must fight.  For an end to all war, and the purification of all mankind.

I don't know many young people who still have their fathers around. I sure as hell know that my friends back in the army are in a better place now; it's God's will for me to stay on this condemned hellhole I suppose. Do you know your Uncle Bren, son?

He was the driver of my old Crusader. Supposed to be your Godfather, too. Served with me when we liberated Issus from those damn Celts, and what a damn good driver he was. You know, swamp isn't exactly the best to drive on, but your Uncle Bren always kept us going. Boys from the Engineering Corps would usually push forward and make us something solid to drive on, but Issus, Issus was different. Our tanks got stuck in the mud, picked off cleanly... Aircraft, tanks, missiles, you name it. They were the lucky ones. If Celt infantry storm your tank, don't listen to your Commander, son. Take your pistol, aim it at your forehead and give it a tight squeeze. God will forgive you, because He understands how agonising it is to be skinned and butchered by a Celt barbarian. I've seen it. I don't want you to end up the same way.

Sorry, got on a little tangent there. Anyway, your Uncle Bren and I helped operate a tank in the 4475th Armor Division, Las Vegas. Graduated Armor school in '71. That's the only way to make a good living, and still is. I could've served in the Department of Truth and the Word, but I was just never good with making things sound nice for people. Government only has so much for everyone. It's only fair if the boys who defend our faith get the most, right? I sometimes feel sorry for the armorers and clothiers who somehow get by with a loaf of bread a week. Anna, from across the street, comes to mind... God bless her and her frail body, sometimes I wonder how a woman can be so thin. 

Don't be scared. I can tell you're a bit shaken up. But it's just the reality of serving God and country on the battlefield. The Celts might be beyond salvation, but you'll be rewarded too for furthering His work down here, for His people. I want to prepare you for what you'll see when you go out and save the people of Cyre from paganism and the Devil's tactics.

When you leave tomorrow, have faith. 

Have faith in your training, which after ten years of conditioning, has turned you into this fine young man. 

Have faith in your equipment. When you take good care of your Crusader, she will get you through anything and everything. No doubt the finest tank in the world.

Have faith in your brothers in arms. They will fight for you and all they ask is that you do the same.

But above all, have faith in God. Remember Psalms 33:20: ""The Lord is our help and our shield.""

You are invincible when your faith is unbreakable. *In God We Trust.*

I tried to incorporate as many social factors and ideas (e.g. Viking theocracy and culture) mentioned in the original post.

The frost moved through the air, an odd combination of fresh ice and day-old smoke permeated through Arnfinn’s nostrills and burnt the back of his throat. Since the last Melting over a century ago winter chills were a rarity, but being full Viking of 9 generations the tall blond engineer had nothing to fear from the cold. His people were used to it. 

The labourer beside him shivered, as he began to pour the molten stone and tar used to make roads these days. A short man he had olive skin and long black hair, Arnfinn supposed he was of Southern European decent. Conquered by the high council and deemed heretics all former nations and citizens under the Holy Vikingland Empire were instructed to work until they found redemption and piety. 


“Today our holy crusaders have taken another city from the Celtic dogs!” Shrieked the radio from commander Erik’s backpack, 

“And now our brave engineers will be laying highways for another conquest, Thor and Odin be with you as we strike down the heretics! ”  

“Strike down the heretics!” Erik and a few of the other Berserks echoed. Arnfinn was sick of the guards, their fanaticism and rolled his eyes in exasperation, their task was meaningless, to build roads that would be destroyed in weeks. 

“What say you?” barked Erik, and Arnfinn swiftly turned to meet the man.

“Nothing, we are nearly finished with the road”

“I didn’t hear you repeat high priest Eskil’s call” Erik stepped close toward the engineer, his shining hammers pinned to his chest uniform reflecting the sunlight and the smell of mead coming off his breath. Arnfinn looked at the hammers, fourth class Berserk, a crusade veteran and 14th generation Viking. Impressive.
“Strike down the heretics” Arnfinn muttered, recoiling at the smell of stale liquor.

“And you heretic dog?” roared Erik

“Strike down the heretics!” the labourer yelled, voice shrill with fear, brown eyes wide and focused on Erik’s rifle.
The Berserk sauntered off, satisfied and smiling at the irony of the European man’s words.

“Poor man,” Arnfinn thought, life expectancy wasn’t long for his type.

Suddenly a distant boom sounded. Men fell to the ground under the shockwave and dust settled over the small contingent. Another warhead had been dropped. From Arnfinn’s experience it had been dropped less than 100 kilometers away and he sighed, another month of injections and therapy would be in store for him. Men cursed, frustrated, but a number of the labourers broke down and sobbed. There was no hope for them, no medicine would be wasted on foreign blood and they knew it. Death would be slow and painful at the hands of radiation poisoning.

“Get to the trucks!” commanded Erik, “We need to get to the city before any of your precious man-parts fall off” he sneered to a chorus of harsh laughter from the Berserks.

“What about the labourers sir?” a rat-faced soldier asked, a knowledgeable sneer written across his thin, pale features. 

“Leave them to finish the job” Erik dryly ordered. 
At that the dark-haired labourer bolted toward the truck, crying out in his own language.
A gunshot silenced the man and pieced the cold air.
Erik lowered his smoking rifle, a grin of joy written across his face. 
“Strike down the heretics” he muttered.
“Strike down the heretics” came the chorus from all beside Arnfinn. He rolled the dead man over.
The man’s tears had begun freezing to his cold, olive cheeks and the first snow began to fall on him.

The words were crudely craved into the back wall of the lobby of - what used to be - a hotel. Colonel Bradley and I had been holed up in the ex-lobby for hours, guns clutched to our chests, huddled for warmth behind an overturned desk.

We stared at the wall for the entirety of our time spent there, mentally poking them, prodding them, weighing them, studying them for meaning, both overt and symbolic. The words made a strange kind of sense to us, though we weren't sure why. I liked to pretend that people who lived before the war, as I had not, had the freedom to choose their own deaths. Perhaps one day, people woke up and thought, ""This is a fine day to die. I have always loved sailing, perhaps I will drown."" This depressed me, but it also comforted me in a way. It was almost like a promise that if I could find a way to end the conflict, I, too, could choose my death. I thought about the death that I would choose, but it was difficult to think of a death of any kind aside from war. I thought about the death the writer of the words would have chosen.

Then I thought about the death he actually chose. He had carved the words into the wall with the butt of his gun, snapping the thing in two as he finished. He must have felt some kind of freedom, some sort of acceptance, as his next move could only have been to hold out his arms out and await his end, his corpse eventually landing not four feet from us, where the bones still laid.

His words, and his death, and the strange way in which he chose it, served as a eulogy for all those who fell after him, including me, whether I lived to see the end of the war or not. I was changed.

I looked at Colonel Bradley, and he smiled back at me. It was a knowing smile. His thoughts must have mirrored mine. He inhaled a breath, paused a moment, and began to speak, uttering a single syllable of an unintelligible word before a disgusting SLAP sound stopped him short, and the side of his face exploded away from the rest, splattering against the wall.

Colonel Bradley, too, had been robbed of his right to die with dignity.

I, on the other hand, was far too preoccupied with another matter: Had he been targetted, or was the bullet a stray?",,False,,t5_2ua25,False,,America,True,t3_uz5ji,http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/uz5ji/eulogy_a_flash_fiction_set_during_the_eternal_war/,

I paused one second to look at the old man, with his scraggly beard and wild eyes.  One look at him, and you could tell he was off his meds.  I said nothing, and spooned some gruel into his bowl.  

""This whole world.""  He grabbed my shirt sleeve.  ""An illusion.  A prison.""

Oh, one of those.  A fanatic.  I was surprised that he was able to walk around freely.  Just a matter of time before the ministry caught up to him.

""Sir, please move on, you're holding up the line.""

He pulled me close.  His breath nearly made me gag.  ""I know who you are.""  He whispered.  My heart started racing.

The line behind him started getting unruly.  He was getting pushed around but still holding on to my shirt.  ""I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean,"" I said, as calmly as I could.  I saw ministry agents moving in.  It always amazed me how they just seemed to appear out of nowhere.  You never see them just standing around.  They seemed to only be seen when they wanted to.

""DECEIVER!"" he yelled as he was being pulled back into the crowd.  I tipped over a pot of gruel, spilling it onto a few people who had pushed to the front of the line.  By the time I looked back up, the fanatic was gone.

He couldn't have known my purpose for being Edinburough, I thought, but it didn't feel like a particularly convincing thought.  


Once we ran out of food, I ran out the back entrance before any riots could start.  The tear gas and sound weapons started being deployed just as the automatic doors closed behind me.  In the leader's infinite mercy, the Ministry of Order always deployed non-lethal crowd control techniques, designed to minimize the suffering of the people who unfortunately were unable to receive their alotment of rations.  It usually took very little time for the crowds to disperse, because the people recognized the futility of asking for more than their fair share.

I was pretty shaken up after the encounter with the religious zealot, so I stepped into a pharmacy booth on the way home.  A quick scan of my vitals and a couple of questions, and out popped a handful of pills a few moments later, which I promptly swallowed.  There were never shortages of meds, only food, for some reason.

As I waited by the street for my ride, a warm chemical rush flowed through me, and I could barely remember what I had been so upset about.

""They say the war is going to be over soon.""  Maura had snuck up behind me.

""They've been saying that for what, 1000 years now?""

""Brian, be careful about that.  The war has ended before.""

""Of course it has.  For a year, maybe.  And then, always, another..."" I lowered my voice.  ""...bomb""

""The car is over this way,"" she said, and we started walking.  ""Anyway, you saw the parade.  So many tanks made this year.  I don't know how they can stop us.""

""A tank isn't going to do anything when you can just walk a bomb into the middle of a city.""

""You know they can't do that again.  All the new security measures.  You can't even take a piss without a camera watching you.""

I nervously looked up and scanned for them.  ""I know, and I'm thankful for it,"" I said.  ""Let's just hope for they're right this time.  About the war ending.""

As we sat in the car, I nervously held my right arm.  Just a few more days, and the cargo that had been formed into the shape of the bones they replaced might make the news stories right, but not in the way they expected.

1339553685.0,3,self.theeternalwar,uz2wd,A story I wrote that might fit several centuries before current Eternal War events (more if you like it),3,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/uz2wd/a_story_i_wrote_that_might_fit_several_centuries/,"The Northstar facility was built deep into the edge of the Rocky Mountains, on top of a natural hotsprings. It had been built originally by the United States Military, as a ‘final contingency’ disaster refuge. It was never intended to be a fallout shelter, per se, but had been created with the goals of long-term survival in mind. The structures walls, at their thickest, were perhaps 5 feet thick (this is only an estimate, as the original specifications have long since been lost). With living space for around 500 support staff, a small hydroponics lab, and storage for food, water and equipment, as well as self-maintaining solar collectors placed off-site, Northstar was geared to operate autonomously for 50 years, at minimum. It had far outlasted expectations, though most of it’s original occupants were long ago gone. The barracks were spread throughout the facility, always on outfacing walls, to best utilize the natural heat the hotsprings provided.
He woke as he usually did, to the faint smell of sulfur wafting into his dreams. The fourth shift alarm was buzzing it’s electronic noise throughout the complex, reminding late risers that it was time for their duty shift. He opened one eye first, then the other, adjusting slowly to consciousness in the poorly lit room. Things came into focus as he pondered if it was really possible that he’d actually slept his usual 7 hours. One had no true way of knowing how much time had passed unless you were in the heart of the building, at the Command and Control Center (CCC), where computers monitored the solar arrays, water flow and air filtration, as well as provided basic CCTV coverage. Today was one of the days Gregor wondered if perhaps the Generals were slowly shortening the time between shifts, minute by minute, day by day. With a groan he rolled himself out of his bunk and placed his feet on the warm concrete. He wiggled his toes as he tried to shake the grogginess from his head. Definitely feeling less than ideal. His duty shift was the last of the day, so it should have been around 1600 hours. It felt like it was 0600, judging by how well-rested he felt. The alarm was still buzzing, set by default to blare for 180 seconds before shutting off. It did not make the hangover easier. After his shift the evening prior, His fellow Northers in hydroponics had invited him to the labs where they were testing the first run of vodka they’d distilled in perhaps 12 months. A more experienced man might have known it to be vile stuff, but Gregor, at a youthful nineteen years old, hadn’t known what he was getting into. Mixed with heavily watered juice, it had hit him pretty hard. He didn’t remember climbing into bed the morning previous, but he shamefully recalled throwing himself at the nearest floor drain in the middle of his conversation with Julia, the pretty tech from the sci-tech division, his body trying to rid itself of the high proof liquor via the quickest means possible. He doubted he could recover his dignity after such failure.
The alarm finally ceased, and in it's absence a dull throb echoed through his head. Groaning once again, he rose shakily and crossed to two steps to his standing locker, and drew his jumpsuit from it's hanger. He stopped to glance briefly at the photo of his father, a wrinkled and fading piece of paper on his locker door. He touched the photo with the knuckles of his hand, then closed the door. He went to the locker under his bunk, and pulled out fresh underwear, arguably the nicest item of clothing he owned, made of a synthetic material that only recently the science division had re-discovered how to synthesize. Unbathed but dressed, he took a deep breath, and drew the curtain across his doorway, and stepped out into his world. Half-lit fluorescent tube lights illuminated the dingy hallway in either direction, slowly curving out of sight. Winter was power rationing season. The Northstar facility had to rely mostly on geothermal heat, which fortunately was relatively reliable, if not plentiful.
As he had for the past 6 years, he made a right out his doorway and strode down the hall. After about 5 minutes he reached a vertical ladder, leading to a thick metal hatch similar to one that might be found on an old armored vehicle or submarine. He drew a small ball peen hammer from one of the many pockets in his olive drab suit, and rapped it against the door, wincing as the sound reverberated through his head. A moment later the sound of a wheel being turned emanated from the hunk of steel, and it swung open with a well-oiled whisper. A shock of red hair appeared at the opening first, followed by a pale, slightly underfed looking face.
Siobhan would have been beautiful, in other circumstances. Several years of gradual malnutrition had turned a lovely girl into a tired-looking woman. She grinned. ""Hallo, Greg, I hope you're feeling right chipper this morning?' she put on a drunken-sounding Irish accent, as best she could imitate. She always argued she had the right since her ancestry was mostly of Gaelic descent. Gregor groaned yet again in response. 'Well that's a bloody good thing. The boys up top brought us down a lovely stack of work' She pointed to a hatch in the ceiling similar to the one in the floor. 'Unsurprisingly, SCARs don't take kindly to being humped around in the rain, tossed in the mud and then frozen! Imagine that.' (one more groan) 'Thus, we have the oh-so-glorious task of taking care of these poor, misused tools of destruction.' A wicked smile spread across her face, and without warning  a roll-up of canvas full of tools hurtled towards Gregor just as he dismounted the ladder. He sloppily caught it before it struck him in the face. 'What's got you all excited?' In his beleaguered state, his inherited east-bloc accent made itself known.
“I’ve had stims and you haven’t! And I’m definitely not hungover, but you are! In any case, we have guns to take apart. There’s some water and some stims on the bench, rookie!” She waved her arm vaguely toward a corner of the cramped room, where a work bench was cluttered  with various tools and weapon components, leaving only room room for one person to uncomfortably sit on the edge. A tall bottle and  two small white tablets sat in the center of that space.
 The smithy, as it was called, had little to do with its historic counterpart. The room was perhaps 15 feet by 40 feet, and every possible surface was covered in weapons in various states of disrepair. Assault rifles of every manufacture lined one wall.  A pile of half-assembled Light Machine Guns lay in a corner. Pistols ranging from autos with CPU controlled sights to early 1900’s revolvers were neatly arranged in partially open drawers under the work station in the center of the room. And in the other corner, several grenade launchers of typical US Military heritage sat carefully disassembled. In the table in the middle of the room, 8 SCARs lay lazily piled, caked in mud, with rust showing in odd spots. It was a sad sight. He grimaced at that, and moved for the pills. Taking the bottle in hand, he tossed the pills back, and took a draught of the filtered ground water, draining half the container in one pull. A breathe, and then the bottle was empty. Better. Bottle slammed back down on the counter.
“Fucking commandos. They yell about being able to tack a man at 300 yards with any weapon they’re handed, but they can’t even be troubled to keep a gun clean. No respect.” Even as he spoke, though, he was straightening up the work area, grabbing tools from the various corners of the room, and organizing them in an orderly fashion. ‘If ever I was taken with them on one of their research parties, I would pistol-whip every man I caught leaving his rifle in the mud.’ Organization complete, he picked up the rifle nearest him in the stack. Siobhan did the same, listening as her standard wry smile remained fixed upon her face. Gregor paused his near-daily rant as he attempted to strip the weapon. He gave a tug at the loading mechanism. Nothing. Next, he depressed the magazine release and gave the magazine a firm tug. Nothing budged. He held the gun before him for a moment, regarding it as one might regard a complicated jigsaw puzzle. Apparently giving up, the gun was calmly set back on the bench, followed by a loud oath in Russian, a language Gregor would never speak as well as his father or grandfather had, but from which he could curse better than most men. Siobhan chuckled, and handed him a strap of rolled up leather. He nodded his thanks, and opened it to reveal an assortment of pin punches. He selected the appropriate item, drew his peen hammer from his pocket, and went to work on the gummed up mechanisms of the poor rifle.

    Year: 3391 A.D.
    Location: Five miles from the Front Lines

The convoy moved forward, flying the flag of the Celtics, creeping through the savage swamps. 1700 years ago the swamp was a place of beauty; trees growing, the wind flying children’s kites. But now, their bones belong to the swamp, the trees belong to the wasteland. That was common around here, the front lines, “the wastes,” and “the wasteland.” It was the words that have spread since the first nuke went out.

*As I said earlier, that was 1700 years ago. And now, a war rages on between the only three superpowers yet, America, Celts, and the Vikings. Every country had a starving population, spies, and the occasional uprising. A stalemate, an “Eternal War” as it started to be called a few hundred years ago. However, let’s get back to the convoy.*

The convoy crept across the swamps, eagerly approaching the front lines to reinforce their comrades. *Ah, yes, the Celts were a communist state.* Every man and tank moved at the same pace, none risking stopping in the irradiated swamps. That’s when the explosion hit. Three tanks went into the air, the men ran, and the other four dozen tanks drove into the swamps. The men were scattered, shooting wildly. *An ambush set up by the Vikings, their fifth attempt to overtake the Celtics after a peace treaty was signed.* The soldiers scattered hiding in any type of cover they could find. Not much when traveling through the swamps. The tanks began to go up in fiery explosions, killing another dozen men with each tank gone. Limbs flew everywhere, and the little water there was in the swamp began to overflow with blood. And the Vikings were still nowhere to be seen.

*That’s when they saw the flag.* The Viking soldiers flew over the swampy hills, hitting the tanks with grenades, and firing thousands of rounds into the soldiers. They blocked off all exits, swarming them from every side. There was no escape for the Celtics, and everyone knew that. They began to regroup near the middle of the swamp, occasionally throwing out green smoke into the Viking lines. The tanks surrounded the Celtic men, only four hundred of the original 1500 man army. Two dozen tanks were left and began to rapidly fire at the charging Vikings, bodies flying every which way, blood scattering the hillsides.

The faint sound of helicopters approached the battlefield. The Vikings looked upwards, to see the Celtic copters. A few dozen of them who started to fire their missiles. Napalm lit up the swamp, devouring every Viking in its path. *Napalm was a very expensive weapon in 3391, only used in dire situations.* Then, the HUD on every single soldier’s screen lit up.  It displayed one word: RETREAT.

That meant one thing; a nuclear missile was yet again launched on the “wastes.” No one cared about sides, no one cared about the napalm, and everyone just ran. The copters immediately turned back to the Celtic side, and the soldiers began to run in every direction. The “wastes” had no SDI, no shield against the missiles. No hope for any men left out there.

The nuke struck the ground, devouring every man, tank, and copter in the path. The men were disintegrated into nothing. The tanks exploded, and the copters crash landing every which way from the EMP blast. No soldier was left. No flag was seen. Only the bodies and machinery was still there, and they would be taken by the swamp, just as the others were.

Every third day they come to our village for recruits, to fight the “Eternal War.”  My brother was taken, about three years ago, every since then my father hides me and my little brother in the basement, evading the recruiters and government thugs.  It was even colder there, in the basement. Around our village people would call cold days like this “Dead Cold Days,” a few people, usually older people or young children would die. They say dieing of the Dead Cold is one of the most peaceful ways to go, like falling asleep.

Food was scarce, few of us would ever feel full.  To feed our family my father took to hunting, but the game he brought back was few and far between.  When he does find game he more often sells it to the others in the village, or on rare occasion to the military men who patrol by.  Sometimes I wonder how things are in the other nations, whether they too have so little as we, if they have to scavenge and sell to the military to get by, whether they have their brother’s taken away.

“We’re better off than most,” my father always says when my brother and I complain of hunger or cold.  We live in a windy farm house on the edge of the town with a backyard facing the vast frozen tundra that looks as if it goes on for miles.  The wood that makes up the house looks grey and distressed, barely able to hold up the second floor, although we never go up the stairs for fear it will fail to do just that. All the buildings are made of this wood, I’ve never seen new wood, my father has told me that it isn’t gray but a light brown or tan color, sturdy and structured, he says it reminds him of life, I wish I could see it.

On Dead Cold days my family sleeps in the common room with the fire, otherwise we surely would freeze to death.  We don’t dare burn wood, no one does, its too valuable to burn for heat, instead we burn livestock chips. The smell is bad, but the warmth far outweighs the smell.  I enjoy watching the flicker of the fire against the wall, it reminds me of the televisions that the cities have, only dimmer, it calms me and takes me mind from the cold and hunger.  Tomorrow is another recruitment day and we have to wake up early to take refuge in the basement, hopefully the Dead Cold will be gone by then.  Although we can’t count that we will eat everyday, we can count on the consistency of recruitment days and the Dead Cold days. I guess in a way its comforting, being able to count on something happening. Even if half the village dies of the Dead Cold I’m sure that they would still come looking for recruits to take away, they never forget to come, they always come.",,False,,t5_2ua25,False,,NewVikingland,True,t3_uys22,http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/uys22/dead_cold_days_fanfiction/,

What happens if the canon war were to be finished? That'd be an end to the conflict, sure others could finish the fight in their own way... but deep down they would know that the fight already has been finished, what's left to accomplish?

First thing I recommend is the CPU patch to prevent the thing from spiking your CPU indefinitely to 100% usage.  Check it out [HERE](http://tim.strafenet.com/civ2.html).

Other than that, I:

* Modified the explosions animation from a file I found on CivFanatics, just so it was prettier
* I removed the ""black lines"" when GRID is enabled, so I only see the white city borders
* Created multiple CITYPREF.TXT files for automatic building, depending on what I'm currently doing (WAR, PEACE, dominating, etc.)
* Found and printed some nifty charts for various things

... and most recently:

* Found the ""ATTITUDE.EXE"" patch last night, but have yet to test it.  It claims to adjust AI attitudes so they don't immediately hate on you after a truce/alliance/what-not
* Found the ""Unlimited"" daemon by Julius Brenzaida, which works, but I will finish my current game (and then run through ""Eternal War"") before I try a completely ""Unlimited"" game.

**Notes:**

It's funny to see some people request a 'crash course' in CIV 2.  There is no such thing, I seem to recall the manual being over 100 pages.  It's certainly one of the most complex PC games I've ever known, with virtually infinite variables.

The next ""Eternal War"" should be a ***Gigantic*** Map generated with the CivMapGen 2.1 utility, found at [CivFanatics CIV2 Download site](http://www.civfanatics.com/civ2/downloads/utilities).  It allows the absolutely largest maps possible (32000+ squares), which I've only played about half-a-game on (3 weeks), you just have to see one to believe how gigatic it is.

Hint 1: you can teraform the square under a city.  I like to turn the land under my cities into Hills, for defensive purposes.

Hint 2: the AI always knows which cities have SDI, and will not target them.  So, build a city *without* SDI within the 2 square umbrella of a city *with* SDI, and let it be a ""bait city"" for the nukes.  I figure counteracting the CPU's ""inside info"" with tactics is only fair.

Hint 3: do NOT build Manhattan Project, until absolutely necessary.  When ONE civilization builds MP, then ANY civ with the proper techs can build nuclear weapons.  Same goes for Apollo and Space Ship parts.

Hint 4:  Building a city on an 'isthmus' creates a CANAL city between larger bodies of water, so you get short-cuts while the CPU will have to go around continents or islands.  You can also build canal cities across continents using inland lakes, if you're lucky enough to get such terrain.

Hint 5:  My favorite build location is either a Pheasant or Grassland with a River (which you can Hill with ENGs later in game).  Building near Whales and Silk is also helpful.  You can build a city in the middle of 4 ""bonus"" tiles, and gain a large advantage.

Last, but not least:  **NEVER** use the Cheat Mode.  Seems pointless on a one-player game, as you only cheat yourself (the computer won't care who wins) -- so, if you lose without cheating, youd deserve to lose but will learn from the experience.

For as long as any of us can remember we have been locked in a war with the Celts and the Vikings. This war has gone far too long but for the good of our people we must continue on, we must keep fighting. For now we have a ceasefire with the Celts, but it is only out of desperation, the desperation that has been caused by the Viking menace.  
  
  For years we have tried to broker peace between each of the remaining superpowers but when we think something has been attained the Vikings start killing everything with nuclear weapons, they do not realize the more they use this the more our childrens children's will suffer. We all think that we are fighting this eternal war for ourselves but I like to think that of we win, it will be for the greater good.  
  
  I know that this war will not be won in my time on this planet but hopefully it will not be won by the warmongering Vikings. In the end of my days I will be defending my great country from the Viking menace.  
  
  Tomorrow I resign my post as leader of my great country and I head to oversee the front lines in our attempt to hold with what little force we have left.

Starting a Journal. I hope it will make the days easier to tell apart. John supplied the book, he works at a sub section of the government or something. The book has been used once for record keeping, there’s a lot of numbers in it. Turned it around and it was fine.

24/June/3967
Talked to John again today, he's sweet. Nothing else beside that happened today, some low tiers hung around outside my house. Didn't dare to venture out.

29/June/3967
Keeping a Journal is hard. Am I supposed to write in it everyday!? I guess once in a while is fine... which i'm writing in the book, which i'm writing in the book that I am writing it in the book. 

3/July/3967
John wasn't home. Liz invited me in anyway. She wanted me to tell her about the Low tiers I saw recently. She told me how disturbing the thought of them making it inside their perimeter was.
I told her I wouldn't know. She laughed, I like her.

8/July/3967
My pen broke. Luckily John brought me a new one. 
I guess I should write Dennis into my journal. Dennis was shipped off today. He had been selected for basic training a couple of months back, Hadn't heard a word form him since. Then, this morning, I received a letter from him. It's not long, but it belongs here.. 

HERE GOES LETTER DO NOT THROW AWAY
“Byblos has been taken. We're sent to replace squadron LW954ZE42
		est. arrival time 12AUG67                                   Sorry”

I'm sorry too.

I spend the night with John. As in I spend “SPEND” the night with John. It was incredible. As I was being taken through security to the inner city, he intercepted our group and asked me to walk with him. He wanted to see where I lived. Suddenly my castle seemed like a run down hovel, not good enough for John to visit. He said he didn't mind and spend the day with me. We talked, and talked  and suddenly we were entangled in each others arms, it was incredible! But i´m feeling so confused now. We were just friends. His wife Liz had become more anxious about how much time we spent together, I like her! I don't want to disappoint her! Urgh, what do I do!?

19/July/3967
John came by again. Explained to him how I felt. He comforted me and told me it would all be okay.  He saw me naked in the daylight. Never again, I was so embarrassed.

21/July/3967
Apparently not embarrassed enough. Told him I was too skinny and looked horrible. He said he would bring me better food. I don't want him to think that I only wanted food. but...






28/July/3967
I didn't see John for days and started to get nervous, then today. Food. Not much, but so much better than our rations. I FEEL so much better! But he had to do it in all secrecy. I wondered whether or not to put it into my journal. But I feel like I must.

Even more Low tiers hanging around these days...

12/August/3967
Dennis made it to Byblos today. Don't know how I feel. 

02/September/3967
Not much time to write these days. I spend all of it with John. We spend a lot of time... doing “it”.
Haven't been with anyone else. The Threat that I might be able to have kids was always too much. But with John I felt like it was worth it. John tells me how Liz can’t have kids, she's a bit older, but we were both raised in the same area. Radiation is much the same everywhere. So the odds of being fertile are fairly low. 

14/NOV/3967
Things me and John have done in the last couple of months:
- Fixed my roof
- Made it so it's actually colder on the outside of the house, than inside.
Build me an actual bed.
- Used said bed.

I love John. I think I always have. Every day with him is special. I don't need this journal anymore.
I think it helped.

01/Jan/3968
Dennis died back in September. Just got the letter. I just can't stop crying. I love John

21/Jan/3968
Me and John have both been feeling sick the last couple of days. I vomit a lot. John sometimes lie so still I think he's dead.

23/Jan/3968
John is dying besides me. At least we are going together.



NO ITS NOT OKAY I WAS GOING TO DIE WITH JOHN WHAT IS HAPPENING

WHY IS THIS HAPPENING

UGH I CANT MOVE AROUND MUCH SO WEAK

I’m pregnant. That’s why the low tiers hung around I think. They hoped I would so they could sell the information or something. Can't stop crying, no John around to stop me this time.

This is how I die.

Staring down the barrel of a gun, into the shadows where my fate lays waiting. I can’t say I’ve seen anything darker than the chamber of that gun. I’ve peered up into the inky night sky, wondering if tomorrow would bring with it some form of sustenance. I’ve stared into the pitch black swamps, listening to the sounds of gunshots in the distance, wrapping my jacket tighter around myself in a pathetic attempt to keep warm. And yet neither of those things are as unnerving as the sight before my eyes.

I remember the first time I saw the war. I had lived in a world that centered solely upon this endless turmoil for seventeen years, but I had never seen the actual devastation up until that point. It came in the form of a massive explosion that uprooted buildings and flattened trees. I think they said the final death count was just over one hundred. I don’t know to be honest – I left the outskirts of the city that day, deciding that it would be safer to try and live off the land than to live hunkered down in a crumbling cement jungle, waiting for the day I died.

A second nuclear bomb went off a few days later, demolishing the place I had called home.

I remember the day my daughter was born. I stood over my wife, holding her hand, watching as her face contorted in agony. There was a woman at the other end of the table – a ‘doctor’ – who was trying to get the baby free. Something was wrong though... There was blood. So much blood. *Too* much blood. I kept wondering how someone could lose that much blood and still be breathing. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew I was losing her – that it was very likely she would never be able to see her own daughter.  But I held on to her, told her that we would raise our child together, that we would protect her from the terrors of this world. That we would be happy.

She died less than an hour later.

I remember the first time I killed a man. For food, no less. He was crouched over a small fire, scooping little handfuls of an unidentifiable mush into his mouth. I had snuck up behind him and was prepared to attack when he turned around. I tackled him to the ground and we struggled a bit. I managed to get on top though, and without hesitation I began to pound the dull letter opener into his chest, over and over like some macabre imitation of CPR. His arms finally went limp, and I greedily scooped up the can, intending to bring it back to my daughter. When I arrived back at our little camp, I handed her the can, and she wordlessly took it. Her eyes remained fixed on the ground the whole time though, and she didn’t take any bites. I knew that she knew. I took the can from her, placing it off to the side, holding her close as she sobbed into my shoulder.

We went hungry that night.

I remember the night my daughter died. Pressing my body up against hers, trying to keep her warm. I remember her meager voice asking me if we could make the fire a little brighter, a little warmer. I hushed her, telling her that I would keep her warm, that she would be ok. More gunshots rang out in the distance, and I was forced to further dim the flames. When she didn’t answer me the next morning, I knew I had lost her too. Whether it was from the cold or the toxic air or the unending hunger didn’t matter. She was gone. I dug a shallow grave and held a short vigil. Then I was gone.

I can’t remember if I cried or not.

I once asked my father if this war would ever come to an end. He didn't answer me at first, and I had assumed that the long period of silence was his way of telling me that he didn't know. After a while though, he cleared his throat and began to speak. ""All wars come to an end son. One day, in your lifetime, this one will too. It could be tomorrow. It could be in a year. It could be in twenty. One day though, you will know peace.""

At the time, I had thought he was merely trying to keep my spirits from falling further than they already had. Now though, twenty-six years later, lying on a dusty patch of earth in an endless marsh, I finally realize what he really meant.

There's a brief flash.

I think this is what peace feels like.

",1,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/theeternalwar/comments/v5yif/the_eternal_war_needs_to_become_an_open_source/,"I read the article about The Eternal War on Ars and was instantly intrigued and found myself here. I am amazed how much attention this has gotten. I think it has to do with the fact that we all find our future and the far possible beyond Fallout 3 bleak view of the world fascinating. (At least the majority of people I think). 

The state of the world during The Eternal War is incredibly fascinating to me and I think it presents either in part or in whole a great basis for a new universe in the gaming space. ( I would maybe change America to a different name as I doubt that for thousands of years the name would endure). 

Anyway when I read the article on Ars Technica the first thing that popped into my mind was that this would be an awesome MMO/Sandobox/Some Social Game kickstarter project or how awesome would it be if content could be created in various mediums to support this world. 

The second thing that popped into my head was that this should be an opensource project meaning that anyone could create/add to the universe in which The Eternal War is based on. So more products, fan fiction, stories, games, hobbies, collectibles could be created and sold.

The owner/creator/inventor of the universe would receive 10% of any products made/sold/produced since it took him 10 years of playing. I think that is fair and would reward him for his efforts. 

This would basically be the opposite of the George Lucas way of doing business where everything is copyright protected and legal hammer enforced. The only requirement to creating additional products and using the universe would be the requirement to pay the 10% royalty fee to the original creator of whatever or derivative of the original work you are using. I don't know if that would be feasible. 

I guess the other option would be to just have the copyright/licensing last only like 5 years or so.  

I just think this is a really cool scenario and I am very surprised that more themed games like this have not been made. (Warhammer 40k isn't the same thing here btw) 

I think the most innovation comes when others take an idea and expand upon it. This could apply to other games/ideas as well.

As the storyline of SMAC goes, the Starship Unity left Earth in 2060, and prior to planetfall, all contact with Earth was lost.  There was no explanation for this - a volcano, a war, an alien invasion -the game was silent on this matter.

The original player of the Eternal War stated that the AIs took part in a Space Race ""at some point"" - which means that a Unity-sized craft would have been launched with the ultimate goal of reaching Alpha Centauri.

""But wait,"" you say, ""aren't the remaining nations, the game map and the timescale drastically different from Earth as we know it?"" What if I told you that dozens of nuclear wars, constant martial law, a worldwide dystopia, authoritarian regimes, several icecap meltings could have rendered a true history of the planet impossible, even down to the largest swathes of details?  That maybe the Vikings, Celts, Americans and Sioux are distant successor civilizations of modern-day states?  That perhaps nuclear weapons, sea level changes and erosion and all kinds of futuristic (but not shown in-game weaponry) may have rendered the continents unrecognizable?  That perhaps it isn't -really- 3991, but perhaps a thousand years earlier, such that the events of Alpha Centauri happen contemporaneously with the Eternal War?

tl;dr Why couldn't the UNSS Unity ever regain contact with Earth, with the result being ideological factions?

If he did, he must have played incredibly casually... to play 10 years and only reach year 3991 (some people could reach that in a few sittings) seems ridiculous.

Even taking 5 minutes per single turn, the last 2000 turns (plenty can reach year 2000 in one sitting) would only take about 7 days played. This is an amount some Diablo III players have already far surpassed and that game just came out last month.

A ridiculous 20 minutes a turn and it's still only 28 days played.

And for the statement ""by the time Civ III was released, I was already well into the distant future"" to be true (Civ III's release date was Oct 2001), it must have actually been over 11 years he was playing -- and all that already well past the year 2000.

And in 10 years playing he didn't even experiment with Feudalism...
