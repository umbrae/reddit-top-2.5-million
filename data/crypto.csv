1293922076.0,63,self.crypto,euosn,Reddit Modern Cryptography Tutorial (RMCT) - Series Announcement,82,19,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/euosn/reddit_modern_cryptography_tutorial_rmct_series/,"After reading the recent discussions about what people would like to see this subreddit cover, it appears that a large proportion of (commenting) users are relatively inexperienced with regards to cryptography but appear willing to learn.

Because of this, I have decided to make this pseudonym account to hopefully guide you through the process of learning modern cryptography.  I aim to do this through a series of posts to this subreddit.

Now I already know that there are numerous 'Introduction to Cryptography' tutorials available on the net.  These appear in various forms including audio, video and lecture notes.  However, my aim is to guide this series based primarily on feedback from other users, making this a much more 'interactive' tutorial than the existing static 'one-way' methods.  I will refer to other materials where appropriate and I think they are of good quality.

I aim to require as little prerequisite knowledge as possible, as I will try to explain everything as the series of posts progresses and the topics arise.  Some of the topics I hope to cover include:

* Symmetric block ciphers.
* Block cipher modes of operation.
* Methods of cryptanalysis (including linear and differential cryptanalysis).
* Hash functions.
* Message Authentication Codes (MACs).
* Asymmetric encryption schemes.
* Implementing cryptography.
* Breaking cryptographic implementations.

I *do not* aim to cover what cryptography is nor cryptography in a historical context.  This is a topic that has been covered many times and the Wikipedia pages for these are pretty good (links: [Cryptography](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cryptography) and [History of Cryptography](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/History_of_cryptography))

However, I feel that I must warn you that some of the topics we will (hopefully) cover may be advanced and require time to think about.  Unfortunately, there is no way around this, but each person may pick and choose which areas they would like to research more thoroughly.

For those that are wondering about myself and my motivations for doing this: cryptography is a major hobby of mine and I have spent a number of years working on the topic.  I feel that cryptography is one of the few areas where multiple interesting topics (such as computer security, mathematics, computer programming and privacy) all mix together and interact.

Thus, I hope users on this subreddit will appreciate this method of learning and the process will be enjoyable for everyone involved.  Please give feedback on the posts I write as this is extremely valuable.  Let me know if you think the topic is not explained adequately, too difficult, too detailed, requires too much prerequisite knowledge etc.  I will also attempt to answer questions where I can.

Please note that I am doing this in my limited spare time and so I cannot guarantee timely updates or even guarantee that the series will run for any significant period of time.  All I can commit to is that I will give it my best shot with the time I have available.

## Administrata

As this is the the first post in the series I have had to take a guess on what level to write for.  Because of this, this post is a bit tentative and all feedback is extremely valuable.  Please let me know your feedback on this post by leaving comments below.  Have you found it too easy? too brief? too much detail? too short? too long? etc.  Some feedback on how fast people would like the series to go would also be appreciated.

Also, feel free to ask questions about the topics discussed in each post and hopefully either myself or another knowledgeable user will be able to answer.  You may feel you want to perform some research yourself and try to answer them.  I strongly encourage this as it is usually the process of actively seeking, thinking about and explaining to others that greatly increases the chances of understanding and rememembering.  Besides, we might get into some interesting topics of discussion.

Additionally, note that I have emphasized terms that I feel are important by placing them in *italics*.

## What is a Symmetric Block Cipher

A symmetric block cipher is best explained by breaking down and explaining the individual words (working backwards, from right to left):

* Cipher - A method of enciphering (encrypting) data.
* Block - The method works with data in blocks ('chunks') of a specific size.
* Symmetric - The method is symmetrical in that it uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.

Thus, combining the above, a symmetric block cipher is *a method of encrypting fixed-size blocks of data where the same key is used to both apply and remove the encryption*.  Henceforth I will not explicitly state symmetric and you may assume that when I refer to a block cipher it is symmetric.

Symmetric block ciphers are one of most commonly used cryptographic primitives.  They are used to encrypt both data in storage (file encryption, drive encryption) and in transit (TLS/SSL).  They can even be turned into PRNGs and stream ciphers by using specific block cipher modes of operation, however, this is something that we will not cover at this time.

The easiest way to think of a block cipher is as a black-box:

                     Key
                       |
                       |
                      \/
    Plaintext --&gt; BLOCK-CIPHER --&gt; Ciphertext

Where:

* Plaintext (p) is the unencrypted message we wish to encrypt.
* Ciphertext (c) is the encrypted message returned from the cipher.
* The Key (K) is the set of parameters that tells the block cipher how to encrypt the data.

Using the abbreviations above this can also be written c=E(K,p).  Which means that c (the ciphertext) is the result of applying an encryption function (E) with the parameters K (the key) on an input p (the plaintext).  Likewise, decryption can be written p=D(K,c).

The mapping of the inputs to outputs is controlled by the secret key.  We will not use the term secret key in further posts to refer to the encryption key for symmetric ciphers (preferring instead, 'key') as this may cause confusion later when we discuss asymmetric encryption schemes.

Mathematically, a block cipher can be thought of as a function which applies a invertible bijective mapping of a set of inputs to a set of outputs.  Bijective means that each output is mapped to only a single input (so two inputs will never result in the same output).  This makes sense when you think about it, as if more than one input results in the same output you would not know which would result is the correct plaintext when decrypting.

When looking at block ciphers in this abstract way it becomes clear that while a block cipher is just a 'simple mapping' between its inputs and outputs, this mapping is the only part that provides the security of the cipher.  Thus, the relationship between the key and the internal mapping must be non-trivial for the cipher to be secure.

## Block Cipher Parameters

Each block cipher has a number of parameters which can affect its security.  The two main parameters are:

* Block length - This is the size of the message upon which the block cipher will operate.  It is usually specified in bits.
* Key size - This is the length of the encryption key.  Again, it is usually specified in bits.

The block lengths for current modern ciphers are usually 128 bits of data.  For messages that are longer than a single block (the majority of cases) a cipher *mode of operation* is required.  Modes of operation will be something that we will return to at a later date.

The key size for modern ciphers is usually 128 or 256 bits in length.  As many other cryptographers have mentioned beforehand: a larger key does not necessarily mean that a cipher is secure, however a shorter key does mean that it is less secure due to the possibility of *brute force attacks*.

## DES and Feistel Ciphers

The first modern real block cipher was the [Data Encryption Standard, DES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard).  This is a cipher with a 64 bit block length and an effective 56 bit key.

DES is a type of *Feistel cipher*.  A Feistel cipher is where a relatively simple function is applied to the data multiple times (it is a type of *iterated block cipher*).  Many modern ciphers are iterated block ciphers.

In the case of DES, the input is split into two 32-bit halves.  Then, for each round (iteration), a *round function* is applied to the right half using a *subkey*.  This is then XORed with the left half and the two halves exchanged.  This is performed 16 times (16 rounds, each with a different subkey).

Note that the two halves are *not* exchanged after the final round.  This makes the whole construction the same for both encryption and decryption and therefore makes implementation easier.  As we will return to later, a simpler scheme with an easier implementation usually leads to a more secure system as the number of bugs are reduced.

Due to the short 56 bit key the security of DES is not really suitable for use today.  Thus the recommendation is not to use DES for any new implementations and only use it where backwards compatibility is required.

1291936507.0,44,self.crypto,ej7m2,SHA-3 finalists,49,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/ej7m2/sha3_finalists/,"I just recieved the following e-mail, sent out to all members of the NIST hash-forum mailing list. It announces the finalists for the SHA-3 competition. I just received this e-mail, the SHA-3 website isn't even updated yet.

---

NIST has selected five SHA-3 candidate algorithms to advance to the third (and final) round:

·         BLAKE

·         Grøstl

·         JH

·         Keccak

·         Skein

 

The selection was challenging, because we had a strong field of fourteen hash algorithms remaining in the SHA-3 competition that were very strong contenders for the hash function standard. Security was our greatest concern, and we took this very seriously, but none of these candidates was clearly broken.  However, it is meaningless to discuss the security of a hash function without relating security to performance, so in reality, NIST wanted highly secure algorithms that also performed well. We preferred to be conservative about security, and in some cases did not select algorithms with exceptional performance, largely because something about them made us “nervous,” even though we knew of no clear attack against the full algorithm.

 

Performance is multidimensional: no algorithm excelled in every dimension.  Every second-round candidate achieved at least tolerable performance on mainstream desktop or server systems, although the performance range was significant.  There were bigger differences on constrained platforms and in hardware, where area is as much a performance factor as speed.  A couple of algorithms were wounded or eliminated by very large area requirements – it seemed that the area they required precluded their use in too much of the potential application space.  Some algorithms allowed very high levels of fine-grain parallelism that could be realized well with hardware, some exploited parallelism with vector units, and some seemed to fully exploit the considerable parallelism that can be achieved by conventional superscalar arithmetic logic units (ALUs) that can simultaneously launch several instructions per clock cycle.  Several algorithms also exploited the power of 64-bit-wide ALUs.

 

No algorithm survived to become a finalist that did not have a clear round structure that could be readily adjusted to trade security for performance.  NIST eliminated several algorithms because of the extent of their second-round tweaks or because of a relative lack of reported cryptanalysis – either tended to create the suspicion that the design might not yet be fully tested and mature. NIST was generally comfortable with tweaks to the number of rounds or to constants, but more suspicious of changes that seemed to affect the structure of the compression functions.

 

Some teams announced the tweaks that they would make if they were selected for the final round.  NIST evaluated the second-round submissions, but not the proposed tweaks.  However, we did consider whether the best attacks on some of the candidates seemed amenable to mitigation by a simple modification.

 

NIST also considered diversity in the selection of the finalists. The selected five finalists incorporated a number of new design ideas that have arisen in the last few years, such as the HAIFA and sponge hash constructions.  The finalists include designs whose nonlinearity is based on the AES S-box, on a smaller (4- or 5-bit wide) S-box efficiently implemented as a sequence of basic logical instructions, and on the interaction between addition and XOR operations.

 

NIST thanks the submitters of all fourteen second-round candidates. Every second-round candidate was a very professional effort, and every candidate had strong features to recommend it.   We also thank the many individuals and organizations who helped with the cryptanalysis of the candidates, or who provided performance data from their own implementations of the candidate algorithms. This selection would not have been possible without their help.

 

NIST will publish a report on the selection of the SHA-3 finalists in the near future that explains the rationale for the selections on an algorithm-by-algorithm basis.

 

If tweaks are being considered for the final round, the submissions are due on January 16, 2011. Specific submission requirements will be provided to the designers of the five SHA-3 finalists.

done by the government, as best I understand it.  The write up explains how 
analysis of call logs could be done while preserving privacy to varying 
degrees, by hashing the phone numbers.  Here it is:

Call log analysis could be implemented using a three party system.  The 
providers, the obfuscating agents and the analysts.  The providers would 
provide the phone numbers to the agents who provide hashes to the analysts 
and keep the randomly generated keys in escrow.

The agency specializes in obfuscating the phone numbers to specifications 
defined by the  analysts __and__ parties concerned with privacy. The keys in 
escrow would require oversight and due process to use.

The hashing specifications would govern the data transformation, hashing
algorithm, key size and the like.  For example: 
    
    {xxx-yyy-zzzz} -&gt; {{SHA1(xxx)}, {SHA1(yyy)}, {SHA1(zzzz)}}

Using different keys for area code, exchange and digits would make it possible 
to apply different policies to each.  It would also make it possible to 
correlate based on each.

Using a one-way hash would require the analyst to suspect wrongdoing, get the 
key, generate the hash and match it to reveal the phone number.

If this works then using hashing and storing the keys in escrow to ensure 
separation of duties is a viable way to do call log analysis with sufficient 
countermeasures to preserve privacy.  So why isn't it being done this way?",,False,,t5_2qq4h,False,,,True,t3_1g473o,http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1g473o/why_is_it_privacy_vs_security_cant_we_have_both/,

My GPA is a 3.5, with some development work experience, but no formal research yet. I'm unsure about how far fetched grad school is considering this.

1. Nearly instantaneous, and designed for chatroom use; something like BitMessage, with its deliberately slow message creation time, won't cut it
2. The underlying encryption relies on either encrypting all messages with every group member's public key or negotiating (N^2 -N) / 2 symmetric keys for every pair of people in the group (or some other similar construction). Having a single room private key doesn't cut it because it would be too easy for that information to fall into the wrong hands and if a leak was discovered there would be no way to correct the problem without relying on an outside channel.
3. Easy to use.
4. Multiplatform (ie. Windows, Mac, Linux, ideally Android too)

Both attacks (BREACH is just a CRIME variant) exploit the fact that compression can leak information about a message by way of the size of the compressed output.

Abstracting further, we could state this as a rule:

*Any transform applied to plaintext prior to encryption that modifies the size of the plaintext in response to its content could potentially leak information about the plaintext.*

Thoughts?

Edit: I ask because I'm considering yanking compression from [this](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne). Seems to me that in a virtual IP network it'd be very easy to execute a variant of CRIME using ICMP PINGs or similar. Yikes. Seems like this would impact OpenVPN, IPSec, meshnets, Tor, all kinds of stuff.

Meaning preboot you are required to enter in a password to decrypt both user/application and sdcard data.  The encryption mechanisms used are kernel modules(dm-crypt,AES) already available in many builds of android.  These modules are widely distributed in the linux ecosystem and considered by many to be very strong encryption.  Also, its worth noting that in the first link the user is running this on a G1.. so horsepower is not a requirement ;).


first theres this:

It's a pet project to educate myself more on cryptography.

The basic idea behind my chat service is that the server will run on a Tor hidden service, the messages will be transported through SSL, the messages are encrypted with RSA keys currently with PKCS1_OAEP cipher (pycrypto library), and each message a user sends includes a new public key to reply to, and some sort of integrity check which I haven't implemented, with hopes that will prevent someone from modifying the message. I know the devil's in the details and that that is a vague description, but that's the general plan. I'm curious if there are any obvious flaws with this idea, at that high level.

So far, this works:

On connect, the server sends it's public key plain-text.

The client responds with its own public key, encrypted to the server's.

There are currently 3 types of requests the client can make: get a list of messages to it, get a list of users (public keys at the moment), and send a user a message. I haven't implemented integrity check, or the method of attaching a new public key to a message to be used for further communication.

One mistake I already know I made is that I encrypt long messages in chunks using that block cipher. What's the right way to do this?

I should probably use a much higher-level crypto library, but again this is mostly for educational purposes.

Do you see any flaws in the general design? Any suggestions? I plan to write the client in C++ after I finish the prototype in Python. The client is really just a simple test of the protocol at the moment, and I'm just happy it seems to work.

Most people use some sort of centralized identity service like Facebook or Google Accounts.  (I'm being deliberately vague here about exactly what I mean by ""identity service""; bear with me).

One big reason why average users are more comfortable with centralized services is that it's easy to deal [insecurely!] with a lost password or hacked account -- you contact the centralized provider and convince them via some out-of-band mechanism (passport scan, etc) that you are who you say you are, and they give you back your account.

In a distributed system like PGP WoT, if a hacker steals your private key, it's pretty much game over.  This is not Grandma-friendly.

Has anybody proposed giving a PGP-WoT style system the ability to perform ""password resets"" (actually ""private key resets"")?  The idea is that while you still control your private key you are encouraged to sign certificates indicating who your friends are, and which groups of friends acting together are authorized to reset your private key.  Ideally each of these groups would include a large number of people most of whom don't know each other, in order to avoid collusion.  The ""ground rules"" of the system would involve the ability to change keys by having the old key sign the new key, **but also** allow changing keys by having every member of a friend-group signed by the old key sign a new key.

The job of serializing these ""key resets"" can be handled the same way Namecoin handles the transfer of key-value pairs.  In fact, this whole idea is probably more appropriate to a ""Namecoin web of trust"" than a PGP web of trust.

Has anything like this this been proposed before?

Is there some kind of simple, yet effective encryption algorithm that's possible to learn and use without computers or even pen&amp;paper? I think there was something called ""knight's cipher"" or simillar, but I can't find it anywhere now.

In short: how would you go about encrypting SMS sent from potatophones such as nokia 3310? What if you were in no way able to use computer to encrypt and at best you had a standard calculator the phone has?

Simple cipher I figured would be using keypad, eg:

    266472885284667

Few notes:

- the decryption doesn't have to be as easy or fast, we can assume decryption can happen on PC. But if it's possible to be decrypted then it's great.
- it doesn't have to be military grade encryption, but something that yields a lot of false positives would be nice
- key-based encryption, so each message can be different (based on time, or maybe key from previous message)",,False,,t5_2qq4h,False,,,True,t3_1fptr2,http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1fptr2/algorithm_that_can_be_effectively_used_inbrain/,

The aim is to keep these guys out (for as long as possible). I also use the computer daily for standard activities (email, word processing, internet), so speed is also relevant.

Would AES be enough, or should I go for cascaded ciphers? If so, which is more secure: AES-Twofish-Serpent or Serpent-Twofish-AES?

Finally, how does cascaded encryption actually help? If you still only use one passphrase, how do multiple ciphers increase security?

(Someone suggested I cross-post this from [reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/h3aap/i_found_a_coded_message_in_a_necklace_anyone_good/), but apologies in advance if this is not the right place for this kind of thing - let me know!)

I've had [this thing](http://imgur.com/y4XBA) for about a year. The necklace (pendant?) had been pinned to the notice board in my old university halls - I assumed it was lost &amp; found, but it stayed there for weeks. One night a friend of mine stole it for me (as a gift, by his drunken logic) and I just sort of kept it.

A little while later I accidentally found a [folded up piece of paper with code on it](http://imgur.com/wDLom), inside the necklace.

I'm not much of a code breaker, but I'm pretty curious as to what it says. I mean, it's probably someone's exam cheat sheet or it just says THE GAME, but anyone want to take a shot anyway?

It got a little water-damaged somewhere along the way, so I tried to re-draw it with a bit more clarity: [http://imgur.com/34hHR](http://imgur.com/34hHR)

Before computers, they were impractical. Now, it's possible to store gigabytes of information  in something smaller than a dime. What's stopping people from just generating a couple of gigabytes of random data, giving a copy to whoever they need to talk to securely, and using that data as the key to a one-time pad?

It would not be hard to write a program that took the random data and used it as a key for a one-time pad (using zeros and ones instead of letters). The program could be made to wipe the random data once it had been used, which would ensure that even if a third party intercepted the encrypted message, they couldn't later find the key and use it.

The private key has to therefore be split up amongst the group such that no one person ever sees the full key. But in order to verify the signature, the corresponding public key must be known.

This could be achieved using RSA with a common modulus. Alice would sign the document, then Bob would sign Alice's signature, then Carol would sign Bob's signature and so forth. You could then construct a combined public key by multiplying everyone's public exponents together.

As I'm cycling through possible keys via brute-force, how can the computer decide that the string it just pulled out is the one I'm looking for?

This would not be an issue with a single byte key as I can quickly scan the results and find the one that is written in english (""the answer is..."").

Initially it seems that if I don't know the format of the original message, I'm SOL. The best I can do is try some form of dictionary search on each potential decryption to see if there are any recognizable words. But if it's yet another string of seemingly random encoded bytes that I'm searching for, how would I now? And even if I knew to decrypt a second layer down, the initial problem exists.

I know that my 'attack' won't work, but I want to know why. 

Let's say that you have been supplied with a Truecrypt volume and a password. You would like to know if the volume contains a hidden volume. Everything I've read tells me that you're out of luck here, there is no way to tell. 

But let's say that you use the password to open up the volume, and you copy all of the contents out. Now, using the same key, the same volume size, and the same Initialization Vector (Those aren't encrypted in any way, right? I think this is where my plan goes wrong.), use those to encrypt the same plaintext that you got out of the truecrypt volume.

If your new volume, and the 'old' volume, are the same, there is no hidden volume. If they are different, there is a hidden volume.

I realize that this won't work. People much smarter than me have tried to break plausible deniability crypto. 

So why doesn't this work? I assume that the answer has something to do with the large pool of entropy that you need before Truecrypt will create a volume. Thanks!

Please post your thoughts on the following, or suggest a better solution.

Would this be a workable system for one-time-use PGP/GPG keys? Benefits include the ability to destroy the message decryption key when you delete the message. The result being that if the master key were compromised it would not compromise any past messages that may have been previously captured on the network.

---

How it works:

Each party has one master key-pair. It is assumed they already have each others master public keys.

All parties generate several one-time-use, temporary key-pairs. Each party signs their temporary public keys with their master private key, then uploads the signed temporary public keys to a modified public key-server.

The sender goes to the key-server and requests a temporary public key for the user they want to encrypt a message to (the key-server then removes that key from its list). Each outgoing message gets signed with a temporary private key (with a short expiry time) generated by the sender. The corresponding sender temporary public key is then signed by the sender's master private key and sent with the message so the signature can be verified. Then, after verifying that the recipient's temporary public key was signed by the recipient's master private key, the message is then encrypted with that temporary public key.

Upon receiving the message the recipient checks that the sender's temporary public key included in the message has been signed by the sender's master private key. Then uses their temporary private key to decrypt the message. Finally they verify the signature using the sender's temporary public key. When they delete the message, they also securely erase the corresponding temporary private key for that message.

---

I'm pretty sure I read about something similar to this at one point. Does it already exist? Is there a better solution? Could OTR (using a Diffie-Helman key exchange) be used in a similar way, with the recipient pre-generating half the components necessary to generate a shared key and putting a list of them on a key-server, the sender including the other half with the message so that it was practical for email, also signing the components for verification purposes? Could this route still be used for multi-party communication (encrypting a message to many recipients)? Would Diffie-Hellman have to be replaced by an authenticated multi-party key agreement protocol (it seems there are several papers on that subject)?

About 2 months ago i made a random number generator using a Geiger counter and a raspberry pi. I posted the result to Reddit and someone asked if i was worried about my radiation source (A uranium died marble) corrupting the memory on the SD card. I had never heard of this before so i googled and found that in fact radiation can when traveling through memory can flip the bits.

My idea is to monitor the bits on the SD card and record when the flipping took place and what bits had changed.

Firstly. Is it possible to read memory like this at the bit level using a higher level language like python? and will the bit flipping be consistent enough to create random numbers? i.e is the flipping of bits something that will happen on off occasion or quite frequently?

I think awareness is an important issue since it seems that most people don't know that this technology has been researched for years in the academia resulting in fully developed end-to-end working systems. For example, [in this testimony video on youtube](http://youtu.be/t4aKOhbbK9E?t=1m30s) the programmer testifies that it is not possible to design a protocol so that the votes can be verified without looking at the source code. This is incorrect, since a number of researchers have independently designed and implemented systems which do have a protocol that allows for verification of cast ballots while protecting the privacy of the voters. [My comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/119j5s/corruption_baincontrolled_company_owns_2012/c6kxhih) on [a recent front-page post regarding Bain-controlled companies for voting machines](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/119j5s/corruption_baincontrolled_company_owns_2012/) went unnoticed.

We use one-way hash functions for that, but hashes aren't always one-way. Also, expecting individuals to remember a few dozen unique passwords seems unreasonable. Yes, services like lastpass exist, but what if users COULD have a single password? 

Why not ask users to register a public key when they make an account, and then at each login present them with a short random string and ask them to sign it with their private key? While most people are unfamiliar with the pki, it strikes me as quite easy to implement at the browser level, since browsers must already have ssl libraries to be able to handle https.

I'm looking at a system that is taking input (x) and returning a base64 encoded string that appears to be encrypted. The system is part of a web application I'm testing. You submit (x) in a form, it returns a cookie consisting of some base64 encrypted 'stuff'. Unfortunately I can't provide any of the encrypted strings for analysis because I don't know what they contain (could have the site URL or something else that would make the client unhappy :) ).

I believe it is a block cipher, I found a boundary where a new block appears in the ciphertext and every 24 characters of plaintext entered after this produces a new block of ciphertext. So it seems to be a block cipher using 24 byte blocks. With 1-4 characters of input, you get back 192 bytes (256 base64 chars), 5-23 gives 216 bytes (288 base64 chars), 29 gives 240 bytes (320 base64 chars) etc...

I do not believe it is ECB. Entering long strings of the same character produces no repeated blocks.

CBC doesn't seem to make sense either. It seems as if a single character change anywhere in the plaintext affects ALL of the ciphertext.

I know the timestamp is being incorporated into the plain text somehow. The system will output the same ciphertext for the same plaintext input multiple times, as long as the requests are submitted within the same SECOND.
eg:suppose I submit these requests at 10:51:38, these are the types of responses I would get:

aaa -&gt; 84eTVV+Re3xeRenrj14qK/gtT1

aab -&gt; fv6qOviVNMmi4Jh70bNymFsP3

aaa -&gt; 84eTVV+Re3xeRenrj14qK/gtT1

Anyone have any ideas? What I'm most hung up on is the fact that a single byte change in the plain text is causing ALL bytes in the ciphertext to change AND at the same time you can get the same ciphertext for the same plaintext suggesting there is no random nonce or anything like that going on.

I am trying to find the sweet spot between the mathematics and the implementations to find some sort of understanding I can play around with.

My question today has to do with PGP (in particular, GnuPG) and what's actually being stored when someone posts their public key.

As far as I understand it, this is Base64 encoded something. I looked through the OpenPGP spec, and while it lays out how to encode data in ASCII-armored format, it doesn't actually specify what the data is or how it is formatted.

Looking around online, I found that the official PGP client encodes a ANS.1 DER sequence of the magic integers you need to actually encode or verify messages. However, I have no idea how the hell DER works, and trying all sorts of ways to get a sensical value out of an online DER decoder (http://lapo.it/asn1js/) turned up nothing (I guess it couldn't properly parse it, which makes me think it's not in that format).

Does anyone know the details of how this is done? I think I'd be satisfied if I could take my keypair (exported from GnuPG), load them into Java/Python/whatever, and use them to sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt -- but without using a third party library to do the import. Alternatively, I'd be really cool if I could use the keys directly to do those things mathematically, without going through java.security or import PyCrypto.

(~4 x 10^26) possible overall substitution ciphers to encrypt one letter, correct? With a three wheel Engima without a reflector only 26^3 (17576) possible overall substitution ciphers are able to be generated out of the 26!.

With certain rotor wirings (say a straight passthrough A-&gt;A etc.) Engima will not generate a unique overall substitution cipher for each position. Whilst this is an extreme example my hunch is that not all rotor wirings/combination of rotor wirings will produce a different overall substitution cipher for each rotation. Whilst I guess _most_ combinations will produce 17576 different overall substitution ciphers the others will only produce between 1 to 17576-1 different overall substitution ciphers.

I played around in Python and came up with a (probably utter shit) way to salt and encrypt without the need to save a salt. 

One of the issues is that this means salts across duplicate passwords are duplicate, but I was curious to share it and gain some insight from people who know more.

Below is the code and ten fake passwords which have been salted and hashed. Basically, the code does this: It's takes a password, ensures it's of a positive length, uses the password mod 4 to do two things: 1) provide a Caesar cipher with a character shift distance for letters and 2) provide a (very shitty) salt. It pads it to a specific length (it actually does this before the caesar and salt), then hashes it with SHA256.


It's written in Python 3.

            return hashedPassword
    
    # This function does most of the work.
    def initialAnalysis(unencryptedPassword):
            # Gets the length (which is needed later on) and determines if password is too long/short.

            if passwordLength &lt; minimumCharacterLength or passwordLength &gt; maximumCharacterLength:
                    print(""Password is either too long or too short."")
            else:
                    # Finds unencryptedPassword Mod 4, uses that for the Caesar cipher and for finding position of salt character. 
                    characterShift = passwordLength % 4

                    paddedUnencryptedPassword = unencryptedPassword + (paddingCharacter * ((maximumCharacterLength + 1) - passwordLength))
                    # Salts password. Very basic, could def use improvement.
                    saltedPaddedUnencryptedPassword = randomCharacter + paddedUnencryptedPassword + randomCharacter
                    # Passes salted password and previously determined modulus to Ceasar cipher.
                    caesarsPassword = caesarCipher(characterShift, saltedPaddedUnencryptedPassword)

Everyone knows that properly encrypted data is random. And random data can't be compressed. So  properly encrypted data can't be compressed, right?

Wrong!

From IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOL. 52, NO. 10, OCTOBER 2004*(!)*  --  ""On Compressing Encrypted Data""

*""In this paper, we investigate the novelty of ... first encrypting and then compressing, without compromising either the compression efficiency or the information-theoretic security. Although counter-intuitive, we show surprisingly that ... this reversal of order is indeed possible in some settings of interest without loss of eithr optimal coding efficiency or perfect secrecy.""*

In Figure 2 of the paper, they define a system where the source is first encrypted, and then compressed. *""The compressor does not have access to the key used in the encryption step. At the decoder, decompression and decryption are performed in a single joint step.""*

Most of the paper (as in, 99.9999% of it) is completely over my head. But it clearly shows that you *can* compress encrypted data, in certain cases, without just cheating by decrypting it, compressing, and then re-encrypting it.

Perhaps lets say: ""encrypted data *normally* can't be compressed"". That accepts that it *can* be done in certain cases.

Could anyone see how 'magic squares' could be incorporated? Just a thought I had.

And I emailed him clarifying the following:

Ideal scenario: Take the number of people in the world into account, which ideally have all distinct fingerprints, then log2(7x10^(9)) gives only roughly 33, which would already be a lot smaller. Of course that scenario requires a complete database of all fingerprints :)

In a real world application you would obviously generate the key from the output of hashing the fingerprint input with some good hashing function, but if you start with a ""bad"" input that wouldn't help you.

During the encryption process, noise processes are added to reach an equilibrium among time elapsation of different plaintext-key combinations, intended to evade time attacks.

I have been thinking about this for a while, and I would like to see a universal cryptography device.

Currently we have Yubikey, ""bank dongles"", RNG-dongles and a few more various crypto devices. But I have yet to see a universal device that can handle almost anything crypto you might throw at it, and that is what I want. Edit: This just in through /r/privacy - http://www.goldkey.com/ - but not open source, and probably don't do all these things I'm asking for!

So this is basically a high level description of what I want:

First of all it has to be TEMPEST resistant (such as power analysis resistant) and tamper proof (impossible to extract keys by taking it apart).

The basic **hardware capabilities**: NFC, Bluetooth, USB, wireless charging, built in screen and keyboard (no smartcard please where you enter the PIN on *another* device you might not own and have to trust *that* device's screen). Also enough CPU, RAM and storage to handle the features I'm going to suggest (I think it should have about 4 GB storage (maybe far more?) - might be overkill, but you never know what you're gonna have to store, like years of Bitcoin keys, or just using it as an encrypted USB drive in general).There is another cool tech that I don't remember the name of that uses your body's electrical field to transfer signals to devices you touch directly, this can be used to keep it in your pocket and unlock doors just by touch.

Features: First one I'm going to mention is **secure key syncing (backup)**. This will be a small device, you can lose it easily (people lose cell phones all the time). So you'll make sure you have a backup device at home, and they sync automatically and securely when you get home, if new keys have been added on either. Lose the one you had on you, go get the one at home and get a new one to sync with. You don't want to lose all your keys! I am thinking about using Bluetooth 4.0 for this (low power usage) and transfer everything encrypted (on top of the BT protocol's encryption).

It could replace all your current **RFID/NFC tags** for doors and such. Depending on the security level needed, it would require PIN, passphrase or nothing in order to unlock the specific door.

It would allow **secure logins** and everything, essentially. Using public key cryptography (or maybe SRP or other auth system), it would let you log in on your computer, on web sites, games, etc... You'll never get your password snatched by spyware/keyloggers again, and no more account hijacking! It would work as two factor authentication (you need the device and the PIN/password for that site's key on it).

It would be able to **authenticate transactions, sign messages**, etc... For most bank sites, this would be a drastical improvement - when you make transactions, the device would simultaneously display the sender (precise account), recipient (precise account), the exact sum to transfer and currency, and any other details you might want (receipt?). You'd sign all these details together. This would make phishing and social engineering much harder, because even the current system with dongles ""gets busted"" by social engineering from time to time. (Would help against ""I lost my dongle, can I use yours?"" but not against ""you just won $100000, transfer $1000 to us to get it"".)

It would keep track of your friends' public keys and more (**keychain**). Logging in to your home computer through SSH? This device can authenticate the other end of the connection and display it on it's screen (""you're now connected to 'My home PC' *(stored personal public key)* [public key hash] over SSH""). Same goes for connecting to your work VPN from a friend. While malware might be able to interfere with the connection if there are any on the computer you're connecting with, restricted priviligies on the account you connect to would be A Good Thing™, and you'd just pull the device out and kill the connection if you find out malware is present.

It would also have an **RNG** for various purposes. It would make it easy to generate new keys *on the device*, and much more. It should obviously be cryptographically secure. One purpose could be as a seed for filling a hard drive with random bits. Another for lotteries. A third for servers that do a lot of nonce/session key generation.

It could be used as a **keystore**, so you can have your Truecrypt keys on it, so you can have this dongle and your encrypted USB drives with you, and be able to easily handle encryption/decryption.

It could be used to handle encryption/decryption externally. This would primarily be useful when you use it to decrypt data where the key is reused for other data and you don't trust the computer for more than holding *that* decrypted data at the moment, or when the computer you're connecting it to is slower at crypto than this crypto device, so it would be used to accelerate encryption/decryption of data.

It could work as a personal TPM for all your devices, including smartphone and laptops.

Recently I have been working on a project to expand [Blowfish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_%28cipher%29) to a 128-bit block size. My variaton is called NOVA2, or N2.


NOVA2 is a variant of Blowfish which doubles the block size to 128 bits. It has the same structure as Blowfish with a few changes to accomodate the larger block. All addition is done mod 2^64. It is designed to be fast on 64-bit processors.

The S-boxes are 8 x 64 S-boxes (8-bit input, 64-bit output). The output had to be expanded because the output of the S-boxes must be the same size as half the block. The S-boxes consume 16KB of memory.

Originally I was going to go with four 16 x 64 S-boxes, which consumed 2MB of memory but there was a performance hit. Probably due to caching. I also did not see a significant security benefit of using 16 x 64 S-boxes.

The P-array is now eighteen 64-bit words (for 16 rounds) instead of 32-bit words in Blowfish because of the larger block size. As a result, the minimum key length is 64 bits and the maximum key length is 896 bits.



The F function has been extended to compute 64-bit values. Four S-box lookups, two addition operations and two XOR operations were added.

The initial vaues of the S-boxes and P-array is the hexadeciaml digits of the fractional part of the square root of 2. I did this to avoid any symmetry with Blowfish during the subkey generation, which uses the constant Pi.


Sample code (Written in C) is available [here](http://nsaathome.org/content/crypto/nova2/n2-sample-1.0.zip)


Aswell as a [draft specification](http://nsaathome.org/content/crypto/nova2/n2-draft.pdf) (No test vectors yet, sorry):


The C sample code includes a file encryption utility, a benchmarking utility (for RAM only), and a random encrypt/decrypt test.

My questions about ring signatures are:

- How does the verifier verify the signature if they only have the public keys of the group members? 
- Do they just sign the message with all the public keys and see if they get the same result (assuming the signature scheme is deterministic [which isn't the case with ECDSA])?

The best way to put it is [here](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/10/24/how-not-to-do-message-integrit/)- given a message M, its tag Tm (MAC(M) = T), a new message N and its tag Tn we build a message such as:

M||N = (M1, ..., Mn, N1 ⊕ Tn, N2, ..., Nn)

The crucial operation is XORing N1 and Tn and then appending the rest of the message.

So my question is - why does this work? How come that the calculated MAC of this new crafted message wil be Tn; and why do you need the implementation to support variable length messages.

I've always wondered why (relatively) few system employ multiple layers of encryption by design. I then learned about the meet-in-the-middle attack (among others), and realized multiple-encryption is something that requires a great deal of care if you want to do correctly.  

While reading Schneier's ""Applied Cryptography"" I came across the method outlined in the following Wikipedia article:    
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_encryption (read the last paragraph before the references)


What I'm looking for is any proof or detailed analysis that will convince me what is the real level of security attained by this design (assuming the individual ciphers are robust and the keys and random pads used for each layer are unique and truly random).      


Also, I'd be happy to make sure I correctly understand the method, if applied to more than two layers -     
It is my understanding that in this case, there would be **no** need to have a ciphertext whose size is:     
   size_in_blocks(plaintext) * 2^(number of layers)    
but rather:
   size_in_blocks(plaintext) * number of layers      
This is because I assume I will:    
+ For each random pad:       
++ Generate a random pad the length of the plaintext in blocks      
++ Encrypt each random pad with its key and algorithm     
++ Send ciphertext

I've been interested in crypto for a while now, and I think I've done an okay job at getting down the basics. I've read a lot about olden ciphers (substitution, vigenere, rot13) and how to break them, and have done some of that one my own. 

I've also practiced coding and have wrote some scripts that do letter frequency analysis with comparison to english, and also look at digraphs and double letters. 

Alas, when it comes to higher level crypto I'm still a bit lost at how to go about learning it, and how to write scripts to play with it and get it down. I've gotten past the point where I thought ""Why is that A upside down and that x in a circle..."" (I know what an XOR is for the record), and I know the difference between a stream and block cipher modes, and public/private keys, but when it comes how to things actually work I'm still a bit lost. 

Can anyone recommend some good articles or links that break down higher level crypto so that I can start to learn it?

Also, I've been accepted to my college's undergraduate research program and want to see if I can work with a professor who does crypto or security research. What are some things that can make my resume particularly attractive to them, besides GPA and programming/Linux knowledge?

I recently purchased a 1TB hard drive for an offsite backup solution. It will use full disk encryption and the standard practice is to first write random data across the entire disk so that encrypted data is indistinguishable from unused space.

10 days ago, I started 'dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda'. It just now finished. The limit being /dev/urandom only being able to spit out good random numbers so fast (slow). There has got to be a better way to get a disk up and running.

TL;DR: Can I securely bypass the random initialization as long as I do 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/encryptedDrive/bigfile' inside the encrypted container, filling it to capacity, and thus, ensuring the outside of the container appears random across the disk?

I've seem to run into a slight issue, though. What I'd like the program to do is this:

* Run program
* Choose ""encrypt"" and the file to encrypt
* Randomly create parameters (numbers) that the algorithm will use to encrypt the message
* Encrypt the message and key(s) and store the products in one or more new .txt files

At another point in time the program is asked to decrypt the message:

* Run program
* Choose ""decrypt"" and file to decrypt
* Get ciphertext from .txt file along with any necessary keys
* Decrypt ciphertext and store message in a new .txt file

The issue here is that in order for the program to encrypt the message in the first place, the encryption method needs a public key that goes with a private key the decryption method has, but communication is only one-way, so that isn't possible. Is there a way around this? It seems that the only ways are to have the encryption method provide both the public and private keys to the cipher, or to lock the program into a single public/private key. Both of these methods seem extremely insecure, as the first we can assume would be intercepted, and the second would fail if another party obtained the program.

Again, I need to find a way to encrypt the random numbers that make the algorithm work. I was thinking of trying RSA, but I learned that java has an elliptical curve class, so I'd like to use that. The issue there is I can't find any examples of message encryption/decryption for ECC, so I don't understand how it works at the moment. I'd rather not have to use a symmetric key algorithm because it seems like it would also fail if someone obtained the program.

So, any suggestions? I have a feeling what I'm aiming for isn't possible, but figured I'd ask before throwing in the towel.

However, I'm a freshman and will have taken only one CS class, so I need to make it clear that I have the knowledge, interest, and initiative necessary. I recently spoke with a professor, and he agreed to consider different ideas I presented.

I am familiar with a wide range of technologies, but I am still a beginner in all of them. The area that I have delved most deeply into is cryptography, and I'm familiar with hash functions, the basic workings of RSA, the use of hashes for password storage, different types of hash functions, their potential weaknesses, nonces, proof of work, etc. I also understand the very basics of algorithmic analysis and can write in Python and Java. I did a little Haskell over last summer, and while I don't remember many specifics it was very eye-opening and fun. More than anything else, I've found the Bitcoin network extremely interesting, and I understand a good deal of its protocol, how it works, and its potential significance. I would also be very open to anything involving the internet; I know less about its workings but I find it very intriguing.

Anyway, I'm obviously going to be working on this myself, but I'd love some suggestions about specific research topics that would be interesting and challenging, particularly those involving crypto and potentially Bitcoin. I have a few months before the program actually starts, so I could learn some necessary skills before the research actually began. I'm open to most ideas, and I'll be brainstorming myself (and posting my ideas here for comments and criticism). I would like to be able to get back to him ASAP, so I'll be moving quickly.

There's this really old fortran utility for calculating solvent accessible surface area (it's for a research project on protein interactions) by the name of NACCESS. It was written circa 1992 and is pretty much the standard tool for this problem. Problem is, I don't have a copy of it, and the author requires you to **mail** him a signed ""confidentiality agreement"" (I kid you not) so that he'll email you the password to the encrypted tarball available on his site.

1. I remember reading a comic about 2 years ago that exactly explains Kerckhoffs's principle.

Where as in the **after**, when a gun is pointed at him, he says the algo is in Wikipedia, but you can't do anything without the key. I found this one funny and drives the point home, but my one hour search couldn't find the exact one. By any chance, does any one have a link to this very comic? I want to include this in my presentation.

2. I have already started taking [this course](https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto) and started to enjoy it(doing lecture 9 right now). Also found [this blog](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/) which has a lot on the topic. I have more than enough to read, but I would like to find out and see if there are any recorded video presentations that I must see(I couldn't find any).

A friend and I were discussing scenarios for unique id generation (neither of us are really familiar with it.)

I thought what might be a good idea would be to write a simple command-line program that takes in a range of numbers (a..b), and outputs a list of secure unique ids, the size of which being size=b-a.


Essentially what I'm thinking is for each number (a..b) on entry, feeding a block-cipher algorithm that number, taking the result and encoding that into a ""UUID.""


A few questions, since this seems to be kind of a simple procedure on the surface...


Does this seem feasible?
Is there anything I'm missing?

We want to build a file-sharing, acentric and friend-to-friend network. And world-scale. Who said too ambitious ? Well, if you don't try, you surely won't succeed. But be sure that we have already a good pile of free-software code, it's not just a fantasy.

So, we want this network as follow:

* Every node is the same as the next one, and we use a [Distributed Hash Table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) to organize the network.
* Each node has a random ID (a key in the DHT) that identify him in the network
* The DHT provide a routing algorithm, as well as the storage of key/values collection

For the file sharing part:

* Each file is divided in chunk, and downloadable by everyone via its key in the DHT (hash of the chunk), and thus we have a [content-addressable storage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage).
* Each chunk is encrypted a private crypto key of the original owner.
* Each node can transmit the needed key to decrypt chunks if the user has decided to allow that.
* Each user has a unique ID, unforgeable, that identify him in the network. This ID could be used on multiple node.
* Each user can share files with different scope (private, targeted, public). This scope is defined for a file or a set of file.
* Private sharing mean only node with the same user ID can decrypt the file (private data replication ...)
* Targeted sharing mean that the owner allow a set of specific user ID to access the file (holiday picture sharing, organization private content ...)
* Public sharing mean that everyone can access the file (free content publication, art content, ...)
* At anytime, chunk or file as a whole are signed by the original owner (so not really a warez network).

So, the big question here, is how the crypto part should be done. More specifically:

* How to identify a user ?
* How to encrypt/sign chunk ? A set of asymmetric key for each file/share ?

I contacted the author of the paper but he did not respond.

This is my first time reading a crypto paper. I am more into other types of security (web mostly) so I was not familiar with all the terminology etc. Sorry if some of the questions come off as retarded, crypto is kind of a whole different language to me.

Here are the questions I asked the author:

1. This attack makes it possible to figure out the plaintext version of CBC mode encrypted text. Does this not mean all CBC mode ciphertext (at least the ciphertexts using the same padding) can be decrypted? Why bother using CBC mode at all if an attack like this exists?

2. C^-1(y) is the decryption function, correct?

3. Why does knowing the padding help at all? I don't understand how knowing whether or not we have a valid padding can affect whether or not we can retrieve plaintext.

4. Because we are looking at the blocks which have padding, this means we can only employ Last Word Oracle on the last block of the block sequence?

5. In section 3.1 (Last Word Oracle) you mention that the most likely valid padding is the one which ends with 1. What makes this so?

6. In section 3 you define a function, the Oracle. What does an Oracle function look like? I am no expert in crypto, but it sounds unlikely that there would be a function that returns exactly 1 or 0 if the padding is valid.

7. In 3.2, you make the assumption that we already managed to get aj ... ab. How is this possible when only Last Word Oracle can only retrieve ab for us?

I am helping out a friend in a politically opressed country.

He needs to have files *HIDDEN* and there must be *NO CLUES* as to that the machine has a true crypt encrypted drive installed.


Therefore I have encrypted an entire drive and mount it through a .bat script.

This is more a security through obscurity and not good enough.
The first thing I would do as an agent of the government would be to search for truecrypt executables as a verification that Truecrypt is being used.

What I have done though is to rename the executable and hide it amongst other files.
The signature could still be found though and I don't feel perfectly safe with this tactic either.

But the REAL issue is how to hide the password from the .bat script. I need some suggestions
on how to code a badass Windows shell, powershell or bash script that completely obfuscates and
obscures the mounting procedure.

The drives are allready in place, and at the moment, they are empty.

I have also implemented a FAIL SAFE which will delete the drive if it is not receiving an SMS
through a php script every 24 hours.

The last thing I have thought about is mounting the drive in a virtual machine which completely obfuscates the process for any investigator.

I've been using some poor password habits lately, and I decided it's time to kick them, but I have multiple sites/services I need to use and don't want to remember/write down some random hash for each one

Ideally, what I'd like is to create a password ""cipher"" that I can use by hand to recover any of my various passwords. I'm looking for the following criteria:

* Strong. I'm aiming for the final password to have 8-14 characters, preferably on the longer (but not too long) side. Symbols, letters, numbers, etc, with any exceptions of my choosing (i.e. no # or $, if desired)

* Paper solvable. In case I forget a password, I'd want to be able to pull out a pencil and paper, and maybe a wallet card with memory prompts for the rules, and generate the password from the known data (my key, the date, the service I'm using, work or personal, etc)

* Keyed. I'd like to use a main keyphrase or number to encrypt the password, something I can change less regularly than a date, for ease of decoding.

* Cycling. Some of my passwords expire, others don't, but still need regular changing. Ideally, the date/month could work as a secondary key, so the main key can stay the same for longer (easier for my brain)

I hope that all makes sense.

I have developed a small password generator and I would love to get some feedback on it. The code (in Haskell) is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/redelmann/scat). A minimal Python port is [available on pastebin](http://pastebin.com/TxDRVDYJ) for those who would not be familiar with Haskell.

I am terribly lazy and until recently used the same password almost everywhere. For this reason, I decided to create a small utility to generate a different password for each website I use.

The idea is to use a single password, and some code you keep on a hardware key, to generate all your passwords. The name of the service you want to generate a password for is also used, as salt, so that passwords are different for each service. The code kept on the hardware key should be at least 128 bits.

The software uses Scrypt to generate a hash, with parameters N=2^14, r=8 and p=50. Then, each time a choice between n alternatives has to be taken as part of the password generation phase, the result (between 0 and n - 1) is the hash modulo n, and the remaining hash is the result of the long division by n.

The default generated passwords have length 18, and contain 2-5 symbols, 2-5 digits, and 2-5 upper case letters, the rest being lower case letters. This leads to an entropy of about 115 bits. 

The program allows also the generation of different forms of passwords: PIN code of any length, pattern lock for android, pass phrases, etc...

Compared to other solutions, one advantage of this system would be that, in the case the key chain containing all your passwords is lost, you can re-generate the exact same passwords again, provided you still remember your master keyword and still have access to your hardware key. An other advantage would be the different password schemas available, which allow to produce the exact format a website require.

I have two main points on which I'd like to have your comments:

First of all, are the passwords generated by the program strong enough?

And, maybe more importantly, the question would be to know if this scheme would still be secure if an attacker gets access to possibly many of the generated passwords (as well has the service name of course).

As I said, I'm welcome any remarks you might have.

Thank you,

However, do you think there is any use for home brew crypto algorithms? I mean, security through obscurity isn't a great practice but doesn't it *help*? What if you use it in conjunction with conventional encryption? 

I wrote my own encryption scheme out of boredom. Without going into too many details, here is how it works:

-User types a message setting plaintext

-User selects a file, the larger and more random the better. Image files greatly preferred do to relative randomness

-Program inventories the byte offset of every byte present in the file. So for example for every time 0x24 appears, I have a table telling me all 20,000 times (or whatever) it shows up, along with an offset.

-MD5 Hash is taken of file

-Hash used as a seed to produce a cypher map, remapping all characters to an alternate byte

-The program iterates through the plaintext (which was just translated via the cypher map), and chooses one of the offsets at random from the list of offsets for the matching byte.

-When its all finished, it uses the md5 hash as a xor key to produce the final cyphertext.

Decryption is a reverse of the process.

Basically, the image file becomes the key. It should be resistant to statistical analysis since there will be a huge amount off possible offsets and only a small amount of plaintext using it. Doesn't matter which offset is chosen it will still decrypt since they all map to the same byte. Notice i said resistant - with small enough key file and big enough plaintext statistical attacks become possible and eventually easy.

XORing with the md5 prevents having a partial key file from working.

I am not asking for someone to break/analyze my system, just as an example of a homebrew algorithm as a context to my initial question.

My opinion is that in a scenario where someone is using a super computer to brute force something, it would sure throw a monkey in the gears if they had to break from established protocol to have someone do a custom analysis of your code. It doesn't take any effort, though it takes time, to take an encrypted file and run it through a super-computer if you know the algorithm and are just missing the key.

Then, these lists are all given to a trusted third party.

I have a couple specific question on the usage of the salt from a cryptographic security standpoint.

Let's take a simplified example where I determine my salt will be 8 alpha-numeric, case-sensitive printable characters long, providing 62^8, or ~97 trillion salt combinations.

In order to increase generation time, a high number of iterations (say, 5000, depending on hash) through the hash function is selected.

Question 1: Each iteration, is there cryptographic significance, from the standpoint of resisting a mathematical break of the scheme, to how the salt and password are combined at each step of the iteration? Is it enough to simply concatenate the prior hash value (last-iteration-hash) along with the salt and password? The goal, as I understand a salt, isn't to improve entropy of the user's password, but simply to perturb the output in one of 97 trillion options (using this example's features.)

Question 2: Looking at my prototype scheme, I observed that a specific alpha-numeric salt (let's just call the ""random"" 8-char salt ""Password"" for obviousness) combined with a weak password (let's use ""x"") is the same as hashing an un-salted password ""Passwordx"" if we just append them. Is it considered cryptographically helpful to combat this by altering appending and pre-appending the salt? Consider the following 2 psudo-code examples for an idea on what I mean:

scheme 1:

    For (( $iteration=1; $iteration &lt; 5000; $iteration++ ))
        $hash=HashingFunction($hash + $salt + $password)
    Done

scheme 2:

    For (( $iteration=1; $iteration &lt; 5000; $iteration++ ))
        If $iteration % 2 = 0  // Modulo 2 alternates the 2 ordering choices
            $string=$salt + $password
        Else
            $string=$password + $salt

Here is a simple thought experiment. We know that finding a message with a particular SHA256 hash is infeasible. But how much can we relax the problem before it becomes (somewhat) feasible?

For example, let's say we have an unknown 100-character message x = [x1 x2 ... x100] that is hashed to produce a 64-character hash y. We know that we cannot get x from y.

But what about if we relax the problem as follows:

1. We know half of the characters in x (non-contiguous). For example we know all the even characters x2, x4, ... x100.

2. We only want to find a single character in x. For example, we only want to know x20. (1 also applies)

3. We only want to know if a single character in x matches a certain range of values. For example, we only want to know if x20 is a letter or a digit. (1,2 also apply)

4. We only want to get a probabilistic answer. For example, we only want to know if x20 is a letter or a digit with p &gt; 0.75. (1,2,3 also apply)

Would any of these relaxations reduce the complexity of the problem?

The part I'm working on now simulates a token device (containing a private key) that accepts a nonce from the server, corresponding to a certain action (login or transaction). The token device will then generate a digital signature of the the altered nonce (to indicate if PIN was correct or not). This signature can then be send to the server to verify that the user has access to the token device.

I found [this tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/security/apisign/index.html) explaining how to create and use the keys, but I think the parameters are outdated. In the example, they use the DSA algorithm, SHA1 hash function, and a key length of 1024 bits. I know from class that I should at least use SHA-256 and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm#Parameter_generation) says key length should be at least 2048 bits for DSA.

Question: Where can I find up-to-date information about what algorithms and parameters are considered secure?

The big conclusion from the paper
Conclusion:
XBX Results May 2012
Conclusion

BLAKE is our first choice on 6 out of 9 analyzed platforms with the Cortex-M3 counting as two analyzed
platforms as it is quite versatile and we made two choices based on low cost and high throughput scenarios. On
the remaining three platforms BLAKE takes second place twice and third place once. BLAKE still appears
to be the most suitable SHA-3 candidate for embedded platforms because it is scalable and balanced, fast
and small.

Skein is strong on high-throughput platforms and therefore should be the first choice on fast modern
ARM Cortex designs, especially when the NEON SIMD extension is available. It comes in second on 3 other
platforms and claims one 3rd place. Overall we consider Skein to be the second best choice for SHA-3 on
embedded platforms by a small margin. It is very fast on fast CPUs and faster than BLAKE at 512-bit on
more than half the platforms. It is also relatively small for 512-bit output.

With two first places, one second place and four third places Keccak comes in third in the overall picture.
After the newest submissions by the Grøstl team Keccak now has to share third rank with Grøstl, which
achieved three first places, one second and one third place.

Keccak is the smallest candidate on our 8-bit platform and among the smallest on the other size sensitive
platforms. Grøstl managed to deliver low memory footprint on AVR and ARM-platforms as well as significant
increases of speed with the newly submitted implementations.

Table 7 list the rankings achived by the candidates according to chapter 6 together with a simple score by
awarding three points for every first place, two points for every second place and one point for every time
the candidate was ranked third.

While all five finalists do work on all analyzed platforms JH can not threaten the others when it comes
to embedded platforms. Keccak and Grøstl excel at the low end, Skein at the high end and BLAKE works
very well across the board.

The tool is rather simple. It will search a file for a data set defined by a regular expressions patten and then bruteforce  the data with a single byte key with a range between 0x1 - 0x255. Nothing earth shattering. I have a couple of questions that I have gotten stuck on. They all revolve around detecting the decoded/decrypted message. Any thoughts, links or ideas would be greatly appreciated. 

* How can I detect valid strings without using a dictionary? 
* Could I use frequency analysis? 
* What if the data set is contained within compiled code such as a malware executable file? 
* Wouldn't ASCII extracted from an executable have a different frequency than dictionary text? Example ""http://google.com""
* What other techniques can be used?
* How would you solve this problem?


Notes:
I have slimmed down the false positives by only printing data sets that have valid ASCII after being XORed. Even with that I still have a high false positive rate of 20+ for each encoded string. I'm not worried about Unicode or wide-chars just ASCII. I have been messing around with doing ngram on ascii strings dumped using the sysinternal strings tool. Odds are I'm going to need to a more powerful machine :) For examples of the data and output please see the following [post](http://hooked-on-mnemonics.blogspot.com/2012/04/adventures-in-bruteforcing.html).

A web site's login page could take the user's passphrase (just as it does now), use the domain name as a salt, and iterate PBKDF2 a predefined number of times to yield a predictable private key, all within he user's browser. The key would then be used to initiate an SSL connection, and the user would be authenticated based on the public key. The user would have previously registered their public key by sending it to the server over a normal SSL-TLS connection, and then responding to a signature challenge.

It's mostly been a case of mental masturbation for awhile now, trying to come up with something that would work. I'd love to hear what you have to say.

###Trustd

A peer to peer framework for disseminating information based on a web of trust. Currently this is aimed at providing a DNS solution for the meshnet, however it is designed to be flexible enough for use with any type of data or resource.

#### Goals

  1. Store the location of a resource by distributing it among a network of peers so that no central point of failure exists.
  2. Utilize dynamically generated trust ratings of peers to ensure that users are directed to their most trusted instance of the resource.
  3. Secure the pointers to the resources location using cryptographically signed documents.
  4. Enable warnings and alerts to be propagated through the network in the event a server is seized or becomes malicious.

#### Key Points

  * Clients choose which servers they trust and how much they trust them. Servers choose which location for the resource they trust the most and provide that to the client. The client then chooses which server it trusts the most and accepts the location for the resource from that single server.
  * Every client MAY run a server instance and maintain their own database but it is not a requirement.
  * Every server node maintains a local copy of the location of the most trusted source for the requested resource.
    * Resources may be referenced by a pointer stored in the database, cached locally, or stored via DHT with the hash stored in the database.
    * In the event of caching, it should be refreshed periodically and if an update comes through the network then it immediately overwrites the cache once the updated is accepted.

### Network Operation

#### Resource Creation

When a client submits a request to create a new database entry, the following steps are taken:

 * Server checks the local database first and if no reference is found it then sends out a request to the entire network for the resource. If no pre-existing version is found, accept the resource as new and enter it in the database. The server will then broadcast the record to the network so that the other systems will update themselves.
   * If the resource already exists on the network, the server SHOULD refuse to create a new record. 
     * This doesn't prevent the record from being created through other means or other servers, but  this maintains the servers integrity by refusing to create duplicate content. 
     * The creator could go elsewhere and try again and perhaps find a node willing to create it, or he could create his own server and attempt to peer with the existing network. In this case, the duplicate content will be created, but the new server will have a non existent trust rating so his content will always be overridden by the preexisting version from other servers.
   * **If the server receives a notification of new resource for an existing record, it should....?** (This is still up for debate)
     * Lower the trust rating of the node that sent the request AND refuse to accept it?
     * Inform the sending server that we already have a record for that entry and let them figure it out?
     * Check the trust rating of the node that sent the request against the node that sent the initial resource for the already existing resource and update the record if the new record comes from a more trusted source?
     * Something else entirely? 


#### Resource Updates

 * Resource updates are pushed around the network. If a client receives an update for which it has more than one trusted source, it will wait until the most trusted source has the update, then accept it and forward it on to peers. (pending simulation) (**note:** I no longer believe this solution will work)
 * Alternatively, it may accept the update once it comes from a node with trust above a certain threshold, even if it is not the most trusted node available.


#### Resource Expiration

 * Servers will periodically check on the resource.
   * Verify that it still exists.
     * Resources will expire to keep from having a needlessly large database.
   * Verify that the resource data you have matches the data your peers have.
 * Allow withdrawal of the resource from the system.
   * Resource servers will use periodically rotated keys to sign their information. These periodic keys will be signed by a master key that SHOULD be stored offline in a secure location and only accessed when required.
   * Both the master key and the periodic key SHALL be accepted to sign documents for the server, however the server SHOULD prefer to use the periodic keys in case of a security breach. 
   * In the event of a hostile server takeover, the server operator SHALL access their master key and broadcast an alert message. Handling of this message is TBD.


#### Resource Revocation

 * In the event of an emergency, for example a compromised server, the owner may revoke the subkeys to prevent further damage to the network. 
   * Server sends a signed revocation method for each subkey it wants revokes using its master key.
   * All other servers see this and immediately refuse to use the requested subkeys to update records.
   * Server generates new subkeys, signs them with the master key, and re-distributes the information.
   * All other servers update their records to use the new subkeys for the applicable records.",,False,,t5_2qq4h,False,,,True,t3_163hqm,http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/163hqm/wot_and_application_to_dns_and_other_services/,

However (this is more of a question) what if we were to set up a server system that does not use symmetric encryption, but rather asymmetric encryption. Obviously this system would not under normal situations have the decrypting key in memory, but rather only encryption key. This would essentially create a receiving only data server that does not posses the ability to decrypt the very data it encrypted.

Also, i have done a touch of research (just enough to know that its not practically possible to do securely with current CPU limitations) on crypto systems can can do work on data they poses but not actually know the data or the work being done (homomorphic encryption). Could a server of this type (or a special arrangement of several of these servers) ever possibly be set up to both encrypt data and decrypt it, but never have the keys to do so on the actual machine?

So instead we use symmetric keys for algorithms like AES that can have varying life spans sometimes measured in years. I was wondering if it were possible to get ""very close to"" the perfect secrecy offered by the one time pad but keep the benefit of the long key life offered by current symmetric schemes (yes, I understand that is exactly what symmetric algorithms are for ... I was just doing this as a mental exercise for fun). This is what I came up with:

a. Generate initial random data (called key) and distribute to all parties involved (i.e. same thing as normal symmetric key generation/distribution)

b. Encrypt message as follows:

1. Choose hash algorithm (called H)
2. Choose random number of iterations (called n) 
3. Generate random data (called rnd)
4. HMAC key and H n times (called derived key)
5. Ciphertext = Message XOR derived key
6. Send H, n, rnd and ciphertext

This scheme has the following benefits:

- Not vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks as easy as XOR is

- Can use the key for much longer than you can with just XOR

- Potential to be very fast (if random numbers are generated well in advance and a fast hash algorithm is chosen with a low value for n)

I believe a lot of the security of this scheme relies on the security of the chosen hash algorithm (and the strength of the random number generator used, of course). 

I work in a field where we apply crypto, not create it. So for all I know what I described is either completely dumb or very similar to how certain symmetric schemes work. If either of those are the case, please excuse my ignorance.

I just had an idea for one involving some math, but I'm not sure what information would need to be public for the key to be calculated while keeping a high level of security. So here are two examples.

In the first, let's say the key is (3x-2)(2x-1). With this key and the knowledge of the algorithm, a person can decipher a message, but is important to know that all a person needs to know are the 3 and 2 (sign doesn't matter). I know prime numbers are often sought after for encryption, so I decided to go with those. At x=15, the polynomial equates to 1247, which is 29\*43. Additionally, for the equation (3x+2)(2x+1) (remember only the 3 and 2 are important), at x=15, the polynomial equates to 1457, which is 31\*47. So, the important numbers here are:

3 &amp; 2 (key) //
2 &amp; 1 //
x=15 //
29 &amp; 43 = 1247 //
31 &amp; 47 = 1457 //
Because I'm using a polynomial, 31\*43 and 29\*47 also go with the polynomials, so 1333 and 1363 could be used. //
31 &amp; 43 = 1333 //
29 &amp; 47 = 1363 //

As for the second example, the polynomial is (23x-5)(13x-1). 24 is the lowest number I could find as a value for x that yields a product of two primes for the four variations of the polynomial.

23 &amp; 13(key) //
5 &amp; 1 //
x=24 //
311 &amp; 547 = 170117 //
313 &amp; 557 = 174341 //
311 &amp; 557 = 173227 //
313 &amp; 547 = 171211 //

So what numbers could I give out that would let a person find the two numbers needed for the key, while still keeping it secure? Or is that even possible with this method?

If that method is not secure enough, would some type of symmetric/asymmetric encryption process work to share the key? I was thinking of RSA, as my algorithm can work with any two prime numbers (the prime numbers being encrypted with RSA).

Edit: Here is how everything works. I'll give a very basic example then go into how it can be more complicated. It's a transposition cipher.

Let's say you have a message 32 characters in length. Take an 8x8 grid and place the first letter in the upper left slot (there are 64 slots in an 8x8 square). Now choose two different numbers that are not divisible by 4, let's say 3 and 2. Now move down 3 slots in the grid and right 2 slots. Place the second character. If you reach a side of the grid, wrap to the other side and continue. Repeat this process until you arrive at the original square. You now move to the upper right square, place the next character, move down 3 slots and left 2 slots until you arrive at the upper right square again. Move to the lower left square, and place the next character, then move up 3 slots and right 2 slots until you arrive at the lower left square. Finally, move to the lower right square and place the next character, go up 3 slots and left 2 slots until you run out of characters.

An 8x8 grid can have a maximum of 32 characters placed inside using this method. You may then fill the other 32 slots with random characters (preferably the randomness is based off of letter frequency). Now create a string by removing the letters as you would if you were reading a book. This string is the ciphertext.

There are a few rules to follow using this type of transposition. First, the sides of the grid must be divisible by 4. Second, the numbers chosen for movement must not be the same or equivalent and may not be divisible by 4. Third, the movement from the starting corners must be symmetric. Outside of that, you should be able to do anything you wish. For instance, if you do not need to follow the order of the corners I chose in the example. You may also move horizontally or vertically in any direction from a corner.

There are several properties to take note of:
- The patterns created by the process allow you to place copies of the grid next to each other (this isn't important)
- Different side lengths can be used, and the maximum number of characters that can be placed placed is four times greater than the length of the smaller side.
- An infinite number of dimensions may be used. If you want to use a cube and have three numbers for movement, you can. If you want to encrypt something in 100 dimensions, you should be able to (I haven't tried anything that big because it's too large to do by hand).
- The patterns can be superimposed onto one another (if you created a grid from the example and didn't fill in random letters, you could take another identically created grid and fill in the blank spaces with the second grid.
- There is a secondary pattern created in a grid. In the example I gave, you may move horizontally 2 and vertically 1 to reach all of the slots from that corner.
- I believe that as you include more dimensions, some, or perhaps all, of the rules I mentioned above become obsolete. For instance, a 4x4x3 or 4x4x2 or 3x3x3 cube seems to work (all slots have at most one character that can be placed inside).

You may also ""pad"" a grid by placing extra rows/columns/etc. around a grid and filling them with random characters.

Anyway, hope that makes sense. I got the polynomials by taking the movement numbers and the secondary patterns. This is all kind of tedious to do by hand, especially as you reach higher lengths and/or dimensions.

http://lasecwww.epfl.ch/php_code/publications/search.php?ref=Vau02a


The problem I am having is finding the *Intermediary Value* which can be used to encrypt/decrypt values at a certain byte. So as I understand it, encryption schemes in CBC mode have a 1-to-1 byte relationship with ciphertext and plaintext; if I modify byte 8 of the ciphertext, byte 8 of the next plaintext block will be modified. We can use this property to find the intermediary value; for example: change byte 8 in the ciphertext over and over until byte 8 in the last block becomes 0x1 (valid padding). The padding oracle will let us know when this happens. So far I think my understanding is correct (feel free to let me know if it isn't)

However, my problem is that I thought there could exist only *one* ciphertext byte which would lead to *one* 0x1 plaintext byte which leads to valid padding. I get two, though. When I retrieve the intermediary value at that byte (ciphertext byte ^ 0x1) I get two different intermediary values.

The problem does not stop there; as far as my understanding of padding oracles goes, I *should* be able to retrieve the plaintext at that byte by simply doing (ciphertext value ^ intermediary value), but I do not. In the previous paragraph I had stated that I found two values that lead to a valid padding, and neither of them lead to the appropriate plaintext at that position.

As an example, WEP to WPA2 has seen a very significant increase in security, and there will undoubtedly going to be future increases.

Assume that it takes a mere 5 milliseconds to convert an entire dictionary, search for real words in the encrypted dictionary, and save the original word and new word in a searchable format for later compiling.

In this algorithm the user is expected to provide a pass-phrase. The key for each block is a hash of the passphrase + a salt value + the original data from the previous block. The purpose of the hash is to generate a random looking key for each block. Then that key is XOR-ed with the data for the block. The length of each block is the length of the hash value.

Example:

Suppose the hash function gives 16 bytes. '++' means concatenation.

    DATA_BLOCK1 = first 16 bytes of data to encrypt
    BLOCK1_KEY = hash( passphrase ++ salt )
    CRYPTED_BLOCK1 = DATA_BLOCK1 XOR BLOCK1_KEY

    DATA_BLOCK2 = next 16 bytes
    BLOCK2_KEY = hash( passphrase ++ salt ++ DATA_BLOCK1 )
    CRYPTED_BLOCK2 = DATA_BLOCK2 XOR BLOCK2_KEY

etc.

To increase the safety the hash method for each block is selected from a list of functions (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-384, SHA-512, etc) using a hash of the passphrase+salt+data of previous block. This produces blocks of different lenghts in a way determined by the data, and adds more variety to the keys.

Any weaknesses?

personal data (i.e., data normally secured using symmetric encryption)? In
short, it seems to me that the utility of public key methods extends to
one-party situations where multiparty communication is irrelevant.

Could you please comment on and add to the following lists?

**Advantages**

1. Two levels of security: to decrypt, one needs both the private key and the
password protecting the private key. Without the private key, brute force and
dictionary attacks are apt to be fruitless as the RSA or El Gamal key is
created from (nearly) random bytes.

2. Ease of use: if one decides to encrypt but not sign, then encryption
proceeds without need for a password. Hence no password plaintext is written to
swap files, left on the clipboard, or detected by keyboard sniffers.

3. Authentication and integrity are optionally gained through signing after encrypting.

4. Ease of updating passwords: one does not have download - decrypt -
reencrypt - reupload data in order to update the password. One merely applies
the password change to one's private keys. Very useful where data are stored on
cloud servers.

5. One can encrypt personal data as a message for two (or more) recipients. If
one loses one's private keys or forgets one's password, the other ""recipients""
can serve as a backdoor way of entry so long as you have their keys and
passwords. Of course, this is also an advantage for any attacker.

6. *Other advantages??*

**Disadvantages**

1. Handling a private key is burdensome where interactive keyboard entry of a
password is typical.

2. For the nonexpert user, public key methods are complex and often
misunderstood.

3. Symmetric encryption is integrated into software like zip, 7zip, etc.
Public key encryption is not (so far as I know).

4. *Other disadvantages??*

Here's the basic details on the encryption used:

* AES is 256 bits in CBC mode with randomly generated key, IV and 8 byte salt.
* RSA is 2048 bits with a public exponent of 65537.
* RSA fingerprints are the MD5 digest of a client’s public key.
* HMAC’s are the SHA256 digest of the AES key and the encrypted message payload. The receiver calculates and verfies the HMAC before attempting to decrypt the message payload.
* Each client generates a unique RSA keypair and AES key for each connection. The exception being if the user saved an RSA keypair. Then each connection uses the same keypair, but AES keys are still randomly generated.
* The AES key, IV, and salt are randomly generated for each message and sent along with the message encrypted with the RSA keys that are exchanged in the handshake.

I'm pretty much using the reference code at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXTEA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXTEA).

According to an analysis article linked from that page there is a chosen plaintext attack when the number of rounds is reduced to six less. [Analysis paper](http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/254.pdf)

Since this is for firmware distribution, the user will not be encrypting with my key, only decrypting, so I don't think the plaintext attack applies to my case. However, I'm still unsure about the number of rounds. My feeling is that more is better - to a point of little return.

I'm not really under any time constraints, so what would be a good number of rounds, or n, using `rounds = 6 + 52/n;`?

* Pycrypto requires the input to be multiple of 16 in length, m2crypto does not.
* Even when the input length is multiple of 16, the ciphertext differs. After experimenting with M2Crypto cipher parameters, it turns out that setting `padding` and `key_as_bytes` to false encrypts to the same ciphertext with pycrypto. So I need to emulate `padding=True` and `key_as_bytes=True` in pure python.

Any help would be much appreciated.

1342632713.0,3,self.crypto,wrp4z,Tor question,9,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/wrp4z/tor_question/,"My knowledge of Tor is very limited but from what I think I know the exit node can read all the traffic between the client and the server even when the connection is done over HTTPS. I was wondering what the problem with implementing the following scheme is (or, if it has already been implemented):

Let:

* C = Client
* S = Server
* E = Exit Node
* C*_pub_* = Client's public key
* C*_priv_* = Client's private key
* S*_pub_* = Server's public key
* S*_priv_* = Server's private key
* SymKey = randomly generated symmetric key

1. C generates a random public/private key pair for the session.
2. C sends S*_pub_*(C*_pub_*)
3. E relays information in step 2 to S
4. S decrypts with S*_priv_* to get C*_pub_*
5. S generates SymKey
6. S sends C*_pub_*(SymKey) + signature
7. E relays information in step 6 to C
8. C verifies signature and then decrypts with C*_priv_* to get SymKey

Now, future messages between S and C are encrypted/decrypted with SymKey and E cannot eavesdrop on the conversation. 

Note: I left out details like C verifying that S's public key belongs to S and C sending a list of supported symmetric algorithms and hash functions to S but those would obviously be in there (left them out to make it easier to read). The use of nonces in there may help to protect against certain types of attacks but I need to think about that a bit more. 

This scheme is not backwards compatible with our current http(s) methods but I was thinking that it could be a protocol that is attempted first by the client and if the server doesn't support it the client can choose to degrade to the existing system (i.e. where the exit node can read all the traffic) or not to continue.

Am I missing something obvious here? Maybe there is a MITM attack I am not seeing?

**EDIT: I knew that SSL/TLS worked from end node client to server but for some reason I thought that the end node in the Tor scheme was the exit node and so it could read that traffic. Now that I think about it, it makes sense that the encryption could be done between the client (not exit node) and server. Not sure why I didn't see that before...**",,False,,t5_2qq4h,1342634027.0,,,True,t3_wrp4z,http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/wrp4z/tor_question/,

Here is the problem: How do you know when you get it right? This isn't random 1's and 0's which can be checked for a ratio of ascii characters, the cipher and plaintext come from the same character sets. How would you write a program that could look at the results from the brute force and determine either definitively that this is the correct plaintext, or at a minimum assign it a probability? This needs to happen automatically without a human looking at it. Oh yeah, and it is very important (critical) that the solution is COMPUTATIONALLY ECONOMICAL. 

One note, I do have a real world problem (not homework) that I need to find a solution for, but it has nothing to do with crypto. It just so happens that the solution to the scenario would exactly match the one I described above. Therefore, I don't need a lecture on how insecure alphabetic substitution algorithms are.

So some basic ideas I had:

Somehow compile a list of short sets of characters (a black list) that could never exist in a string of properly formed English words, even accounting for the words being smashed together without whitespace. How I would find such a list I have no idea, I am sure someone who is an expert in English or language would have some insights.

Write a formula that calculates the probability that the string is English, based on things like certain double letters, vowel combinations, etc. Again, language isn't my bag, so I think I'd be pretty aimless at this. 

The less computation that is used to check the string the better. The more bad strings it can ""filter out"" the better. It doesn't have to be 100% perfect at finding the one sure fire key, but if it could narrow it down by 75% or more it would probably be enough for my purposes. 

I hope that makes sense. Thanks for taking some of your brain cycles to help me work this out.

I am curious what everyone's thoughts on password security are, for example the pros and cons of using computer-generated random strings verses passphrases, and what are the best ways to measure the strength of said passwords? Is it fair to just talk about bits of entropy?

I got nudged to think about this by the [XKCD comic on password strength](http://xkcd.com/936/). I liked the method suggested and started using it, but being cumbersome to generate such passwords I eventually made a commandline tool and then a [web page](http://lightsecond.com/passphrase.html) implementing a client-side-only generator in Javascript.

My commandline tool in ruby uses /dev/urandom so it gets good entropy, but Math.random() didn't have that in JS so today I got done coding a newbie library to collect and pool entropy from mouse movements instead.

All my code is CC0 in case anyone else finds it useful; but I was wondering if you have some pointers on how to confirm it is secure enough to use to generate high quality passwords, whether there are libraries I could be using for entropy instead of making my own (or else what faults in my code are obvious at a glance) and whether I am even approaching things right or using the right kind of terminology. :3

One would generate as many byte swaps as there were bytes, and so byte 0 would swap with the generated position (edit: 0 to length of file, so passed-by bytes would be swapped again), byte 1 would swap with the next generated position, etc. Encryption was pretty fast, and especially for large files they were heavily scrambled. Combining with other algorithms (edit: read 3DES, etc at the time) yielded a pretty secure file. The drawback was, undoing the scramble required building a table that had as many entries as the number of bytes in the file and re-producing the byte swaps while keeping track of the destinations in the table. eg the table would start out with 0 : 0, 1 : 1, and each swap would track the position of the byte through the tables so they could then be undone. (Edit: For some reason I thought of this algorithm today, and...) I'd love to reinvigorate this algorithm, but was hoping someone had a nifty idea to shorten the descrambling process and memory requirements to make it sustainable for up to 10 GB files. Is there a practical way to do so?

edit: a way to save on memory but not CPU would be to iterate through the entire file length sequence for each byte and just worry about the final destination of that byte such that one would write descrambled file back out one byte at a time by determining which offset in the scrambled file to pull from.",,False,,t5_2qq4h,True,,,True,t3_ipgv9,http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/ipgv9/file_scrambling_algorithm/,

to prove I was in posession of today.  Let's further say that I do not
wish the contents of this document made public unless and until it may
be necessary to do so to prove the above, so publishing the document
today is not a solution.

I understand that there are various schemes for digitally signing
documents, and I'm in the process of trying to understand which of those
would best suit this scenario.  It seems to me, though, that there is
a very simple approach that would serve.

I believe that if I encrypt the document with a symmetric cipher (AES,
for example) and keep the key secret, then compute a secure hash of
the encrypted document and publish that hash, I will have accomplished
my need.  In this case, by ""publish"" I mean distribute it in such a way
that it acquires evidence of the approximate time it was made public.

An old fashioned way to do this would be to put an advertisement in
a newspaper with the hash in it.  This poduces thousands of physical
copies distributed over a large geographical area, with lots of correlated
date evidence.  The more modern equivalent, of course, is to simply cast
it into the Cloud and let the currents carry it far and wide, accreting
more date evidence as it goes (hence, ""cloud seeding"").

If I need to prove that I posessed the document at the time I claim
I did, I simply need to track down one or more public copies of the
hash (noting the date evidence), demonstrate that the hash matches the
encrypted document, and show that I have the key to decrypt the document.
The greater the number of disparate copies of the hash value that I track
down, the stronger the evidence for the claimed date.

""Cast it into the Cloud"" above is actually a bit glib.  It is important
to place the seed in places where it has the maximum probability of being
replicated and further distributed.  Furthermore, it must be done in
such a way as to maximize the chances of being able to recover one or
more credible copies when the need arises.

Hash collisions are not a great concern, because the colliding source
would have to be not just arbitrary data that hashed to the same value,
but data that also decrypted to a plausible document.  (If this existed
it would weaken my claim to the date and document, but not necessarily
invalidate it.)

I realize this is somewhat probabilistic and sloppy in a sense, but
it has the advantages of not requiring a public key infrastructure,
signing authorities, certificates, trusted third parties, commercial
interests, etc.  In some ways this makes it harder to subvert than a more
deterministic system.  Also bear in mind that the application in question
calls for a legal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, rather
than a mathematical proof of correctness.  The required precision of
the time is also rather lax.  An accuracy of a few days would be adequate.

So I invite anyone who has borne with me this far to comment.  Am I
missing something basic.  Am I flat out wrong?  Is this just dumb?

Oh, and by the way...

So you put in your master password and the website (it can catch the website automatically or you type it in yourself) and it outputs a unique password for you, mainly based on the security of the master password characters, but uniqueness of the website characters? That way you don't have to worry about a database as it would be the same across all installations.

1) the potential introduction of a physical keylogger

2) the potential compromise of the machine's bootloader, to introduce keylogging or similar

In reference to #2, it seems to me that such an attack could be detected by having the encrypted machine checksum the bootloader immediately after the encrypted container(s) are unlocked. If the binary responsible for checksuming the bootloader (and the reference checksum) are stored in the encrypted container itself, this would be a reliable and effective means of ensuring that one had *not* been compromised in this manner, wouldn't it..?

I need to convert a [PEAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_Extensible_Authentication_Protocol) challenge/response (from a Radius server) into input for oclHashcat.

[Here](http://wirelessdefence.org/Contents/FreeRadius%20Wireless%20Pwnage%20Edition.htm) is an example of the challenge/response:

* challenge: 15:37:16:6d:49:77:76:d3
* response: c5:0e:63:87:c6:7f:b8:6f:97:0e:ef:d1:9f:d0:f3:a0:9a:8d:f8:42:43:06:68:12

I need to convert this so I can feed it to oclHashcat. So far, I've used the script on [this page](http://blog.opensecurityresearch.com/2012/04/capturing-and-cracking-peap.html) (made by Reddit user winfang!) to convert the format (it also mentions that the hash is a NetNTLM hash): 

* challenge: 1537166d497776d3
* response: c50e6387c67fb86f970eefd19fd0f3a09a8df84243066812

[Here](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) is a list of example hash formats for oclHashcat input.
[Here](https://hashcat.net/trac/ticket/98) is a page that details NetNTLM format, but I haven't been able to find this info elsewhere.
[Here](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=oclhashcat_plus) is the oclHashcat-plus help file.

Apparently, I need 3 parts: LM respnse, NTLM response and Challenge, but I only have the last 2.
Can I generate the first part? Am I using the wrong hash algorithm in oclHashcat?

Main question: How do I crack the example challenge/response using oclHashcat?

Alice would reply by sending back what Bob sent + the other half of the AES private key and the initialization vector which she generated randomly as well.

1. Sender encrypts ""Hello, "" and sends to intermediary.
2. Intermediary appends the string ""world!"" to the original string, and sends the final, encrypted message to the receiver.
3. Receiver decrypts the secure message once and receives the string ""Hello, world!""

So, I'm trying to make a script for wiping a LUKS-header, and only the header.

According to LUKS' [FAQ](https://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#5._Security_Aspects) (See 5.4), I can calculate the size of the header using the following formula:

    (keyslots x stripes x keysize) + offset bytes

Using the standard options, this should be exactly 1.052.672 bytes.

To get all the pieces for the calculation, I call the following command:

    cryptsetup luksDump &lt;disk&gt;

The relevant parts of that command is, AFAIK this:

    Cipher name:               twofish
    Cipher mode:      cbc-essiv:sha256
    Payload offset:               4096
    MK bits:                       256
    AF stripes:                   4000
    Slots:                           1

So my formula looks like this:

    (1 slot * 4000 stripes * 256 bits) + 4096 = 1.028.096 bytes

However, if I set the amount of stripes to 4096, I get the correct amount of bytes:

    (1 slot * 4096 stripes * 256 bits) + 4096 = 1.052.672 bytes

I then made a header-backup using cryptsetups internal command:

    cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup --header-backup-file &lt;backup-file&gt; /dev/&lt;disk&gt;

The size of &lt;backup-file&gt; was excactly 1.052.672 bytes, so something's wrong with my first calculation.

Heard that user data (from any source, database, memory etc.) can be embedded in real time into the rendering window of a game (by altering the frame buffer data).

I think it's bullshit and would like to be proven wrong.


What I've got so far:

I dont know any steganography software that works in real time:


* S Tools 
* Steganos Suite 
* Camouflage 2.0 
* Dmagic 
* Hermetic 
* Stego 
* jpeg-jsteg 
* Snow 
* Steghide
* wbStego


All do their embedding post image, not during the drawing of the image.


The world of warcraft etc embedding is done when using the **game engines screenshot function**.

Apparently the guy who found the WoW stegnograph **used the screenshot function** on specific settings. [Thread on WoW stephograph](http://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-general/375573-looking-inside-your-screenshots.html). 

Take note of this: 

&gt; The secret watermark which is being intentionally embedded inside **WoW generated screenshots** below top quality

&gt; Do note that this covert watermarking has been confirmed, by multiple sources, to have started immediately or soon after Patch 2.1.0 in 2007 (before the Activision deal), **which introduced JPG screenshots** for the first time

&gt; It looks like when Blizzard decided to add JPG screenshots into the WoW client, they also teamed up with [Digimarc](http://www.digimarc.com) to provide us this wonderful service of secretly tagging our **in-game screenshots** with our account and realm information


Does this not seem slightly odd? It's not being embedded in real time, it's being done via the **in-game screenshot function**, and for some reason still not being done at top quality.


Not saying they don't encode data, just that using your own screen capture device and not the in game screenshot will not produce a code.

When you're playing a game the pixels are being drawn in line by line (per pixel vertically, but an entire horizontal line AFAIK) in real time, there's no way you could embed a bunch of queer code like information into the rendering window as the initial data of the render hasn't been made fully yet so the extra data can't be hidden within it?

The image you're seeing while playing a game is not a JPG like the screenshot taken by the in game screenshot function. So it can't carry the data.

Also from that WoW thread: ""Thanks to _Mike, we also verified that there is no pattern included in high quality screenshots like TGA and JPG/10""

In my spare time, I've been fiddling with the HElib code and going through Gentry's thesis at the same time. I've got some toy examples going and that's about it. I can quickly build circuits to the point where the noise becomes too large to decrypt, which is expected. My understanding is there should be some mechanism to ""bootstrap"" (simulate the encryption) in order to get the noise levels reset, but I can't find this in the code.

I know Gentry's thesis isn't entirely relevant anymore because BGV has moved beyond it, but I thought BGV still worked on bootstrapping.

1368711140.0,0,self.crypto,1eg6j5,Help me describe/identify this challenge-response protocol/algorithm (an intruder alarm anti-code decoder),2,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1eg6j5/help_me_describeidentify_this_challengeresponse/,"My area of expertise is reverse engineering, specifically embedded systems. I do attack cryptographic systems, but this largely involves key recovery or exploiting the implementation.

I was asked to reverse engineer a simple Windows executable used as part of a challenge-response protocol used for intruder alarm systems. This was trivially easy. I would like some assistance in describing the protocol/algorithm, so that I can look into the security of the system more.

**The protocol**

The protocol is designed to stop users resetting their alarm without contacting their alarm receiving centre.

a) When the alarm is triggered, a message is displayed:

&gt; CONTACT ARC 

&gt; QUOTE 83647

This is called the ""*quote code*"" and is always numeric and 5 digits long. I don't know how it is chosen, but it appears random.

b) The alarm user calls the alarm receiving centre and informs them of the quote code.

c) The alarm receiving centre inputs the quote code into a piece of software (the ""decoder"") which returns the numeric 5 digit ""*reset code*"".

d) The user is informed of the ""reset code"" and inputs it into the alarm. It is accepted and the alarm is disarmed.

The alarm and alarm receiving centre share a secret which is a number from 0-255, this is called the ""*version*"".

So at a superficial level, both the alarm and alarm receiving centre are doing:

&gt; ResetCode = F(QuoteCode, Version)

Where the QuoteCode and ResetCode are integers in the range 00000-99999 and the Version is a number between 0-255.

**Algorithm implementation**

This is my basic implementation of the algorithm used to generate the reset code given the quote code. The vector at the top is altered, but the rest is the same.

    # Taken from the data in the exe
    vector = [3,3,5,5,8,1,3,9,8,0,5,9,3,9,4,1,1,0,9,4,3,0,2,2,8,4,3,2,8,4,9,4,1,3,3,3,3,8,5,3,0,2,4,3,2,1,8,9,0,5,4,3,9,5,8,3,9,9,1,0,0,9,9,3,3,8,2,
             1,4,9,1,4,9,2,9,0,9,5,3,9,5,3,3,5,9,1,0,2,9,3,2,1,2,9,8,0,4,9,4,2,3,9,4,0,1,8,5,3,3,9,9,1,0,5,9,3,8,9,4,8,4,2,3,1,0,3,9,4,8,2,0,4,3,3,
             1,0,5,2,8,3,3,5,2,8,3,2,9,5,2,1,2,4,4,3,0,4,2,3,4,1,8,2,9,1,0,5,1,8,2,4,3,5,1,0,3,8,5,3,2,1,1,3,9,3,2,3,5,8,3,9,0,3,2,3,5,3,8,4,0,3,9,
             1,9,3,0,2,9,3,8,1,4,2,8,4,0,1,9,1,0,1,2,1,3,5,3,3,9,0,2,1,4,1,2,3,4,3,4,9,5,3,5,9,3,1,3,9,4,0,3,2,3,3,4,4,2,1]

    
    def generate_reset(quote, version):
        i = 0
        tens = 0
        reset = []
    
        while i &lt;= 4 :
            j = 0
            result = 0
    
            while j &lt;= 4:
                offset = (version + tens + quote[j]) % 256
                result = result + vector[offset]
                tens = tens + 10
                j = j + 1
    
            reset.append(result%10)
            i = i + 1
    
        return reset
    
    print(generate_reset(quote = [0,0,0,0,2], version=131))

I have run several simulations (simply by looping through all combinations of inputs), and noted the following:

1. The coverage of reset codes for any given version number across all quote codes is between 60-70%. This means that you have a higher than 1/10000 chance of guessing the correct reset code randomly.

2. Given a quote code and reset code, most of the time there is only a single valid version number. At most, two pairs of quote and reset codes are needed to derive the version number. The ""version"" isn't very secret as a result.

**Questions**

I hope these aren't too vague, or broad.

1. What would you call the type of algorithm? To me it looks like a hash with a key - does this make it a MAC?

2. Does this specific implementation have a name? It looks very ""roll your own"" but the vendor uses the phrase ""military grade"".

3. Are there any glaring issues with this algorithm? (I'm not expecting someone to do a full analysis, just some pointers would be great). My gut feeling is that the secret ""version number"" is not long enough to provide adequate secrecy.",,False,,t5_2qq4h,False,,,True,t3_1eg6j5,http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1eg6j5/help_me_describeidentify_this_challengeresponse/,

1367550973.0,0,self.crypto,1dliiy,I figure this is the place to come to find people experienced in cryptography. I'm looking for a partner to head up the Internet Education Initiative.,4,4,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1dliiy/i_figure_this_is_the_place_to_come_to_find_people/,"To be completely transparent, this is about the fifth or sixth post I've made in pursuit of a partner to start this -- I just posted this over in /r/CryptoAnarchy too, but it looked kind of dead.  I'm sorry if that seems like spam, but I feel strongly that this is something that needs to be done, and I'll keep looking until I can find someone.  So, here's what I propose:

The idea behind the Internet Education Initiative is quite straightforward and rooted deeply in the CryptoParty Handbook ([PDF](http://weise7.org/tmp/cryptobook-v1.1.pdf)).  I want to teach people about the Internet.  That includes how to use it to find reliable sources of news as well as different viewpoints on events, about the wealth of free software that exists which respects one's privacy, and how to operate on the Net safely.

The Internet is one of the most valuable resources that we have today.  In fact, it will make this generation great.  I know that sounds hyperbolic, but think about it:  The Internet is a neutral platform, which can be devoid of oppression or censorship, on which people from all races and creeds can collaborate.  All of the ideas and beliefs, all of the talents and abilities, all of the minds could work together to solve all the problems of the world if we taught people to use the Internet and use it safely.

Of course, that's a long way off, but we have to start somewhere, don't we?  And that's why the Internet Education Initiative is something that we need to start up.

The Internet is scary to some people, and understandably so.  There is a lot that goes on, whether it be human trafficking or the distribution of illegal content as well as viruses and just plain malicious people, all lurking in the dark depths of the Internet.  But, the Internet is so much more than all of that -- it has so much more potential than the hands that have stained it.

Recent events only evince the malfeasance and ignorance (both terms meant in the least derogatory way possible) surrounding the Internet.  People simply don't understand it.  The Internet, to a lot of people, is just Google, Facebook, and Wikipedia and that's okay.  Those three things capture the essence of what the Internet is capable of:  the sharing of ideas, the collaboration of people, and the acquisition of knowledge.  We just need to teach people to go deeper and to do it safely.

Now, I don't claim to be some Internet or software savant.  I've put in place many insurances, whether they be software or habits, to ensure my privacy and safety, but I do not, truthfully, understand them.  That's why I'm looking for someone skilled in cryptographic practices and technologies.  In order for us to teach each others, we must first learn, and that's what the Internet Education Initiative will be all about.  Teaching people how to do things, like find reliable and opposing sources of news to get a better view of events, like visiting platforms on which they can discuss and share ideas, and like arming themselves with tools to protect themselves on the Internet.  But there are only so many people that we can reach through the Internet itself.  Many people will never hear of us if they don't venture as deep into the Net.  That's why the Internet Education Initiative will not only teach people how to use the Internet, but also to teach other people to use the Internet.  Hopefully, we can found groups within communities who can reach out and teach others in a friendly way outside of the Internet.

Not only will we teach people about how to use the Internet, but the Internet Education Initiative will also stand as vanguards to the Internet, besides organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Free Software Foundation, and the American Civil Liberties Union.  We'll teach people about the threats that the Internet faces and what we can do to ensure that remains a free platform.  Of course, we will aim to be as un-hyperbolic as possible, aiming to teach people with impartial information rather than feed the FUD machine.

So, that's the Internet Education Initiative in a nutshell.  Of course, cryptographers are not the only ones welcome to join in.  Anyone who has any talent or ability, or anyone who just wants to help me spread the word -- please do.  The Internet is home to all, and the Internet Education Initiative can be the people's school.",,False,,t5_2qq4h,False,,,True,t3_1dliiy,http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1dliiy/i_figure_this_is_the_place_to_come_to_find_people/,
1366157749.0,0,self.crypto,1chyht,Banking PINS Entry Theorie,5,5,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1chyht/banking_pins_entry_theorie/,"Hello everybody, 

I am a university student trying to understand a simple system used by many banks. The PINS Entry gadget. I am a bit confused and would like to read up on this more and would like to consult your help.

For this case, lets take the Barclays Online Banking:
You need 3 things to login to your online account:

1. Membership Number 

2. Debit/Credit Card + PIN

3. PINEntry Gadget

The gadget: http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1218/1438197131_1e0d474266_z.jpg

**The process:**

1. When you log in, you specify your membership number and the last 4 digits of your card. 

2. You put your card into the pinsentry and click on respond, enter your PIN and a 8-digit number is generated.

3. Enter 8-digit respond number into the online form and login.


So this  is the process, now what about the cryptography. **How simple is that system and how secure is that ?**

I assume that the card holds some basic information such as the card number. The gadget itself has some sort of algorithm working with a timestamp or some sort of generator of the bank to create a 8-digit number. 

Is the same number generated on the server side as well ? If so, how is that possible ? The server does not know when and how fast I type in the 8-digits. Obviously people are different, an older person might be slower than a younger one. How can it come up with the same number, when there is a time difference of 5 minutes ? I can still login after 5 minutes. I could create also 20 new 8-digit numbers within that 5 minutes. Each of them would be valid. How does that work? 

Since there is no password set, and only the 4-digits of the card and the PIN is used. What is actually checked? I assume that the 8-digits of the PINSentry responde message is used as the initial IV for an AES counter mode encryption? 

I would be interested if somebody could tell me about the theory behind this and what I need to read up.

Because of this bias, each produced character is slightly more likely to be the same as the preceding character than what it should be; at any stage, the next character is not truly random. As such, each character does not provide a unit of information content, but slightly less, so that after about 7000 output characters, we will have lost one unit of information.

From the documentation on hidden volumes:

&gt; TrueCrypt first attempts to decrypt the standard volume header using the entered password. If it fails, it loads the area of the volume where a hidden volume header can be stored (i.e. bytes 65536–131071, which contain solely random data when there is no hidden volume within the volume) to RAM and attempts to decrypt it using the entered password. Note that hidden volume headers cannot be identified, as they appear to consist entirely of random data.

From the hidden operating systems docs:

&gt; When you enter a pre-boot authentication password, the TrueCrypt Boot Loader first attempts to decrypt (using the entered password) the last 512 bytes of the first logical track of the system drive (where encrypted master key data for non-hidden encrypted system partitions/drives are normally stored). If it fails and if there is a partition behind the active partition, the TrueCrypt Boot Loader (even if there is actually no hidden volume on the drive) automatically tries to decrypt (using the same entered password again) the area of the first partition behind the active partition where the encrypted header of a possible hidden volume might be stored (however, if the size of the active partition is less than 256 MB, then the data is read from the second partition behind the active one, because Windows 7 and later, by default, do not boot from the partition on which they are installed). Note that TrueCrypt never knows if there is a hidden volume in advance (the hidden volume header cannot be identified, as it appears to consist entirely of random data). If the header is successfully decrypted (for information on how TrueCrypt determines that it was successfully decrypted, see the section Encryption Scheme), the information about the size of the hidden volume is retrieved from the decrypted header (which is still stored in RAM), and the hidden volume is mounted (its size also determines its offset).

Why can't the person forcing you to reveal your password see that the password authentication failed on the first attempt and succeeded on the second attempt, thus proving that you are mounting the hidden volume? Is it because you could put your *real* volume as the first or second volume and your adversary wouldn't know the difference and couldn't prove that you have a second volume? If that is the case, is it possible to make the first volume attempted always be random noise (and not decryptable) so that your adversary wouldn't know by the failure of the first decryption attempt that you are showing a hidden volume?",,False,,t5_2qq4h,False,,,True,t3_pr79z,http://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/pr79z/truecrypt_hidden_volume_question/,

-----------


I used to work in tech support for an encryption startup called ""Authentica."" They eventually were bought out by EMC and their product didn't go anywhere.

From what I learned of encryption is that it goes letter by letter, and ""cracking"" encryption is about trying different algorithms until you start getting clear text, which the computer recognizes as clear text and the encryption is cracked.

Why not use numbers to words encryption though? Can anyone tell me if this is not a better way? Basically, you take the words from the dictionary, assign each word a string of numbers (like using Perl key-value pairs, the number is the key, the word is the value), and write an algorithm so that each time a word repeats, it uses a second and third and fourth string of numbers so you can't crack it based on repeating number patterns.

You keep the encryption/decryption software on computers that are not connected to the Internet, and use a USB drive to transfer the messages to the un-networked computers and back.

it seems to me this would be harder to crack than encrypting letter by letter.

Assume an engine that can deterministically generate a cartoonish, Spore-like character where each bit controls an attribute (skin/hair color, mouth type, eye type, pose, etc) from a string of bits. It produces a memorable, unique creature from that fingerprint, kind of like nature.

It might be easier to recognize your public key's avatar at a glance. These might also help non-technical users to verify downloads.

What would the security pitfalls be in such a scheme? One thing that comes to mind is the potential for creatures so close together that it is easy for an attacker to spoof by creating a character that looks almost the same -- kind of like those ""circle the picture that's different"" puzzles in a kid's coloring book. Could this be overcome with better encoding (mixing, instead of one-bit-per-feature? a simulated DNA expression that controls the features?) Are there other issues with this sort of scheme?
