He took only a moment to think about it and said back, ""Oh good. There are girls I like, but I've also seen gay guys that I like too. Thank you!""

I'm feeling really awesome about the entire exchange and just needed to share. It's just so awesome to me how totally mundane it was for both of us to ""come out"" to each other at a random moment. Neither of us were phased by the other's answer.

I've been out for 18 years or so and I don't have (m)any bisexual friends. Heck, I don't have many friends to start with anyway.

I have a male friend who I've known for 15 years. He identified as straight before I knew him and identified as bi when I met him. He has only been with and talked about men since I've known him in those 15 years, and he's never talked about attraction to women so in my mind his sexuality evolved to being gay. At lunch a few weeks ago he reminded me he still finds women attractive even though he hasn't acted on it (or even talked about it) and I realised I had been in the wrong and made the mistake of thinking he was gay. 

So, while I can't apologise to everyone here for every time a person has incorrectly projected their labels onto you, what I do want to say is that there's some genuinely loving and kind people out there that might be your friends and your family, that might make assumptions about you. They might think you're straight, they might believe you're confused, they might assume you're gay. It's not necessarily because they don't accept who you are, or because they're in denial, it might just be because of an assumption made early on that snowballed into a belief.

What I'm really trying to say, is if your loved one's incorrectly label you, know that they might (just maybe) really and truly be ready to adjust their perspective, they might just need you to remind them.

Thanks :) Big hugs to everyone.",,False,,t5_2qwnx,False,,ainbow,True,t3_1c0zdc,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1c0zdc/as_a_gay_guy_im_glad_i_joined_rbisexual_its/,

The new mod of r/lgbt is Laurelai, who I believe is an internet troll. [This](http://i.imgur.com/pWf3Q.png) is just one example of why she should not be the moderator of any LGBT community.

Even if she wanted to create a safe space, as she claims, consider that in the SRS inspired [r/rainbowwatch](http://www.reddit.com/r/rainbowwatch) subreddit she created and mods with SilentAgony (one of r/lgbt's other mods) one of the only 8 posts there asserts that that a post looking for films that deal with trans issues like Boys Don't Cry **MUST** really about looking for ""t-girl porn."" &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

If they cannot or will not create a safe place in a subreddit with only 8 posts I do not believe they can or will in an active subreddit of 36,000 readers. 


If Laurelai attacks users like that, right after they come out to her as genderqueer, she is unsuitable for a position as a moderator of any LGBT subreddit. 

The post I made [calling this behaviour out](http://i.imgur.com/p6aZC.png) in r/lgbt **was deleted**. That is why I believe my only option is to try and let as many people know as possible in the other LGBTQ subreddits. 

I'm not saying this to create drama, but to let people know that r/lgbt is no longer a safe space. I feel I must spread the word wherever I can to protect people - especially those who may be struggling with their sexuality or gender issues - from an abusive environment.

Wanna read about how things turned out?,254,26,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/mzvps/soi_came_out_to_my_wife_wanna_read_about_how/,"So, last night at the bar I finally gathered up my courage and told my wife that I am bisexual.  We had both had a few drinks, and a comment from someone here kept running through my mind, over and over again. They said something to the effect that they would rather be themselves than hide it from their wife.  I've been struggling with this feeling as well, and last night it all gushed forth.


She listened. She listened to me tell her that I have these feelings that, until lately, I've been struggling to accept.  I have accepted them. I know who I am.  


Then I waited for her reaction. I saw divorce papers in my future, a fight over the kids, the house, the dogs...I saw embarrassment as she told everyone ""He likes the cock!"" and pointed and laughed. Mentally, I was doomed. She would hate me, feel like I led her on and lied to her.  WHY DID I DO THIS TO THE WOMAN I LOVE!?! 


Instead? She smiled.  She smiled her beautiful smile and said she loved me, and she could tell something had been on my mind.  She said she accepted me no matter what, that's what the rings stood for and that's why we're together.  She said our roles have always been off from societies views and, well, FUCK SOCIETY.  


We talked in the bar. We talked out in the car.  We talked all the way to the bedroom, where we then did other things...and even talked some more afterwards.


This has the makings of a beautiful new beginning of my marriage to my partner, best friend, lover and all around greatest person ever in my life.

We used to work together and bonded almost immediately. A little over 2 years ago (within about 6 months of each other) we ended up getting divorces from our spouses. Mine was due to her infidelities and his was more because of her drinking and financially ruining him. We were both left in a pretty rough spot financially and decided to become roommates. 

Before moving in I decided to come out to him. He was my best friend and we were going to be living together so I thought he should know. And now that I was single again I wasn't going to hide who I was anymore. I have always been attracted to both men and women but due to a severe religious upbringing I married early because it was what I was ""supposed"" to do. I was really worried that coming out to him would freak him out and ruin our friendship but the exact opposite happened. He kinda laughed when I finally told him my big secret and said it was no big deal and that he was bi also. 

We moved in together and life was good and our friendship seemed to deepen. We both actively dated people and routinely brought our dates home. I tended to bring home guys more than women and he almost exclusively brought home women. Due to thin walls neither of us had much doubt about what the other was doing when we brought them home.

During this time however I started to realize I was becoming more and more attracted to him. He's young, handsome and has a terrific body. We were already friends but now seeing him all the time I found myself developing feelings for him. He had never expressed romantic or sexual feelings for me so I never brought it up. We were two guys sharing an apartment and overtime I think he started to realize I was attracted to him. He'd tease me by walking to and from the shower nude when he new I'd see him. He would ""accidentally"" leave his door open when he was dressing or undressing and he always wore very little clothing in the summer. 

Recently our company had a series of layoffs and we both lost our jobs. Thankfully we were both able to find new ones pretty quick but while mine was in the same city, his was across the state and would require him to move. This past weekend was to be our last weekend alone at home. Most of his stuff was packed up and all that was left was a few little things and our couch and TV (both of which were being sold on Craig's List). We arranged for us to have one last ""guys night"". We played Xbox for a while and finally ended up sitting there watching Netflix. 

We both had a couple beers and I took the plunge. I looked him in the eyes and told him how much I had been attracted to him and that I felt like I had a crush on him. We talked about it and he said that he also found me attractive. He never said anything because he didn't want to ruin our friendship or make things awkward. But now he was moving away and there wasn't any reason to hold back. He asked me what I wanted to do the most, so I leaned in and kissed him. 

We had only been kissing for a moment when I put my hands in his pants. Before long we were undressed and we did everything. I've always been more of a bottom when I'm with men and he took the role of top with no problem. By the end we were exhausted and fell asleep in each others arms under on the couch. 

Waking up next to him was one of the greatest feelings ever. We snuggled and talked about the night before and how we had wasted so much time not doing it before now. We had a long serious talk after breakfast. His new job was several hours away. We'd never be able to see each other as much as we would want. Serious talk became more serious. I felt like crying but kept it together. We looked at our savings and financial situation and since my new job will be paying significantly more than the old one and we both have a decent amount of savings, he's going to stay and keep looking for something here and we'll continue living together. It's like the whole world has changed between us and all for the better.

I'm a 23 year-old gay male. I'm not very active in my local LGBTQ community, but whenever I go to a gay bar or meet other gay guys and girls, I notice a lot of them don't believe in bisexuality, calling it a phase or an excuse. I even have a close (lesbian) friend who I've discussed the issue with, but she remains convinced bisexuality doesn't exist. I find this idea insulting and hypocritical. I think it's as if they're saying ""people should believe *me* when *I* say that I'm gay and it's not a choice or an act, but they shouldn't believe *those bisexual people*. Oh no. *They're* different.""

Anyway, I wonder how you guys perceive this. Is this something that you notice a lot? How do you guys deal with it? Do you know any good ways I/other people can use to convince them bisexuality is real? 

P.S. I realize this post could also be written in /r/transgender, as there are a lot of parallels with transphobia in the LGBTQ community, I think.

**EDIT: Wow, I didn't think I'd get this many reactions to this thread. Thank you, guys! I love reading your stories and comments. As I'm not bisexual myself, my curiosity can't be answered by introspection, so it's really nice to read what you have to say!**",,False,,t5_2qwnx,1373663184.0,,ainbow,True,t3_1i5rst,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1i5rst/biphobia_in_the_lgbtq_community_question_from_a/,

Your information is just as protected, just as anonymous -- even if you're logged into your Google Account!

We're five days away from being at our one-year mark for this survey, but I figured I better go ahead and roll it out, since we are now celebrating **10,000 subscribers!**

Just like last time: I'm going to leave it open for a week and analyze the results on ***September 12, 2012***. It's only ~~10~~ 12 questions and should take you less than five minutes! :)

As a femme, and as someone who used to identify as bi when I was younger, I have some idea of what it's like to feel invisible.  I have also come across some of the hate you experience.  I have seen lesbians on reddit and sometimes in real life who bi-bash because they perpetuate the myths or have an ex that is bisexual.  These same girls don't suddenly stop dating all lesbians-who-love-dogs just because they happened to have a bad experience with an ex/fling who was a lesbian-who-loves-dogs!  

But I, personally, think ya'll are pretty great.  I have noticed you tend to be more open minded in general.  For example, I am quite the trans-ally. Though I have seen gay &amp; straight cis-people say &amp; do awful, insensitive things, most bisexual people I know or see on reddit act quite the opposite.

I am also a big flirt.  My girlfriend &amp; I are in an open relationship.  The bisexual girls I meet (and flirt with) have always been understanding of my relationship arrangement and don't try to force monogamy on me.  They don't make assumptions and are generally fun and mature.  Oh, and my girlfriend actually *prefers* bisexual women, so there's that!

Bisexual people I have met are the first to stand up for me if I'm being harassed at a bar.  They will defend my lesbian identity even as my fellow lesbians diss them.

Anyway, these are just my own, probably biased observations.  But I just thought you should know that I friggen &lt;3 you.

1351732593.0,157,self.bisexual,12fm0w,This is the story of how I asked a male friend to convince me I wasn't a lesbian.  [NSFW],194,37,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/12fm0w/this_is_the_story_of_how_i_asked_a_male_friend_to/,"I've noticed an outcry of people wanting to liven this place up a bit.  I have some dirty laundry that suits this need quite nicely.


When I was about 20, I had recently broken up with a girlfriend of 3 years and looking to get laid. I hadn't been with a guy in about 4 years and didn't think I could ever be with one again. The last time was a pretty fucked up situation. However, as time went on, I started to suspect that I may still have a lingering attraction for men.  Upon the urging of my best friend, I started searching for an appropriate candidate for some hetero sexual exploration.

So, I proposed to a guy friend of mine that he help me carry out this experiment (in the name of science of course) to see if I was capable of enjoying sex with a man. I went to his apartment, we drank some rum, and filled him in on the situation. He was completely down for it.  You know, being the helpful guy he was. *Such a giver, that one*.

I said to him, ""Basically, if I don't start screaming, it's fine. Just keep going. You have a pretty low bar to hurdle here,"" He said, ""Well, let's get to it then. No reason to make this awkward, let's go to the bedroom.""  I have some serious respect for any guy that could still get hard after hearing this.

We went to the bedroom and the foreplay started. He was a bit on the smaller side on all counts (I chose this on purpose. I needed to make certain I didn't feel threatened).  We undressed each other and got right down to it.  I had a couple moments where I felt a little weird, but overall, I was enjoying myself...much to my surprise.  There was no ""sexy talk""--it was all too clinical for that.  This was in the pursuit of higher understanding!

We spent about 3 hours re-initiating me into the land of heterosexual-a-go-go-land. The entry was somewhat painful, but eased by the fact that he was pretty small.  In the end, I had a splitting orgasm while he railed me from behind.  

Since then, I have been with several people of both gender.  But to this day, when we see each other, he'll winks at me and says, ""In the name of science!""

Ok, here it goes. BTW I'm male.

A few weeks ago, we had an assignment at my College where we were supposed to team up with someone from another course. I was away from school that day and was very happy when a cute girl had posted on the freshman FB-page that she was too, and needed someone from my course to team up with.

Anyways, we start working with the assignment and it's all kinda awkward. I liked her in many ways but she was very quiet, and I always feel awkward being older, a guy, and more of a ""leader type"". This awkwardness continues until we find ourselves drunk at a school party. We talk constantly for about two hours, and then decide to head home... But I can't find my keys... So I casually say: ""Well, since I can't get in to my apartment, we could just get a room at the hotel"" (where I got the guts, only god knows). As if by magic, she says ""ok, sure"".

Fast forward two weeks, we nailed the assignment and each other, the latter several times a day during the whole school-thing. She turns me on simply by breathing, and she claims she gets wet just by standing to close to me in school.

Bare with me, here comes the awesome part... She invites me to a pre-party at her place, with her gay friend and some other people. We get drunk, shuffle around town, and I, being totally confident around her, flirt furiously with her gay (dude) friend. (BTW she knows I'm bi). 

When it's time to go home, she says ""Derp is coming with us"". I thought he was gonna sleep in another room or something. As soon as we get to her place, she immediately gets naked and invites me to bed, the gay friend follows... Needless to say, I felt like a king, two people who are both only turned on by me, one of them being a straight girl and the other a gay guy. Awesome sex followed, sandwiches and everything.

And this is the kicker: No awkwardness followed. They're totally fine with the whole thing. I just feel so lucky.",,False,,t5_2qwnx,False,,,True,t3_q92i4,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/q92i4/how_can_i_be_this_lucky/,

I'm an avid reader, but first time poster. 

Since I was 13 (I'm 23 now) I've had thoughts about fooling around with another guy. Those thoughts subsided as I chased girls in high school and dated, but they've always bounced around my mind. I find men attractive, but I've never considered myself gay. 

Well I decided it was time to act on some of these thoughts and made it happen. After a few weeks on various sites I came across a guy who I was comfortable talking to. We exchanged some text messages over the course of a couple of days and then met up in person. When I got to his house we drank some wine and chatted as he finished painting a closet. 

We went down to his couch to watch game of thrones and started fooling around. Kissing a man for the first time was a strange experience, the way his stubble scratched at my face was tantalizing. Wee eventually traded blowjobs and then just relaxed together for a while. 

I don't know why society makes such a big deal out of sexuality. I enjoy sucking a dick as much as I like eating a pussy. His muscular body was a nice change from a woman's soft curves. 

It feels good to say this to someone - even if its over the internet - because I don't yet feel comfortable sharing this part of me with my family and friends. ",,False,,t5_2qwnx,False,,,True,t3_1idqy0,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1idqy0/finally_bit_the_bullet/,

She's only 12, so should have been asleep, but being summer, I don't make a fuss if she stays up late. 

I sat down on the bed with her, and shared my yogurt while we chatted about this and that. Eventually we got on the topic of camp, which she had just returned from. The following conversation happened.

Me: Did you meet any lesbians at camp?

Her: Yeah, a few.

Me: Any of your bunk mates?

Her: No, but one of the girls was bi-curious.

Me: Well, there's nothing wrong with that. I'm bisexual as well. (She's aware of this)

Her: I know, me too!

Me: Really? (jokingly) Let me guess, you have a thing for [best friend]? 

Her: Are you stupid dad? No, not her. One of the girls at camp, [girls name].

At that point I hugged her, kissed her on the head and told her that was nothing to be ashamed of, and let her know how proud of her I was that she felt comfortable enough with me to tell me.

I wish that more people had as easy a time opening up to their parents as she did with me.

I got a few responses, but none of them piqued my interest until this one I got on Wednesday.

Let's call him Tim. He messages me, I explain I'm new and want to experiment a little. We meet up for coffee over the weekend and hang out for a few hours that day. The next day, he invites me over to his house. This is where it gets good.

We start making out on the bed, which to be honest I'm still not used to. It's a little weird to have facial hair scratch against your face, and I don't think I'll ever get used to touching a hairy leg. Pretty soon, we're both naked and I'm jacking him off. He goes down on me and starts to suck away, and it feels incredible. He was super gentle and understanding, and asked me how everything felt and to let him know if I was uncomfortable. 

I sucked his dick, and I'm pretty sure I was awful at it. But I liked it. We made out some more, then he came on my chest and I came on his. Seeing him cum on me was one of the hottest things I've ever witnessed.

It was an interesting experience, and I think I'll probably do it again in the near future.

DON'T let people, and ESPECIALLY ANYONE put you down for being Bisexual.

DON'T respect anybody who asks you to ""pick a side"", or force you to believe that ""you're going through a phase"".

YOU ARE BISEXUAL. OWN IT.

I love you very much.

My grandmother passed away just over 1 year ago. The only family I have left to speak of are my mother's parents, not close, my half brother, my aunt and uncle, and a couple cousins. The only person I talk to on any sort of regular basis is my aunt. She helped raise me when I was a wee hellion and giving my poor 60+ Momo (grandmother) a hard time. She's a really nice lady but woefully ignorant and doesn't really know how to deal with anyone who isn't straight, white and religious. (I grew up in the bible belt)

I don't really fit that bill. I identify as an atheist, always have, and I'm not shy about expressing my opinions. She takes what I have to say with a thoughtful smile most of the time and says ""I love you no matter what, sugar"". She's sweet. She tries. But damnit some of the things that come out of her mouth are offensive at worst and hilarious at best. The issue of my sexuality isn't something I've ever really broached with her or any of my family simply because its awkward as hell. I've never been in a relationship with a woman (I'm a girl) so my bisexuality isn't something thats ever really come up. I haven't taken any steps to hide my feelings. We just never talked about it. 

The town I grew up in is **small**. We're talking when you get in trouble at school, your parent will call you because some other parent called them to tell them about it. My Momo knew when I was late to class in the middle of the day or when I had gotten a speeding ticket before I even got home. One of the nutsos called my aunt to tell them I needed to be added to a prayer list because of my ""interested in"" on facebook said men and women. She promptly told them to fuck off and then called me. 

The conversation went like this:

*Aunt: Krystalbc87 do you swing both ways?

*Me: Uhhhhh, what?

*Aunt: Some nosey bitch said you needed to be on our prayer list because you swing both ways? That true?

*Me: Uhhh, yeah, I guess. I mean I'm attracted to men and women if thats what you mean. 

*Aunt: Well just so you know, the next time you come into town we should go get you some of those nasty female condoms for you and (fiance) to use when you have a threesome. 

*Me: WTF?! No, I don't want to have a threesome!

*Aunt: Well, ok. Just thought you might. Let me know if you do and I'll get you some.

**Definition**

The definition of *bisexuality* is:
&gt;A sexual orientation in which a person is attracted to both males and females.

Some people also define it as attraction to more than one gender. You cannot control who you are attracted to. But you *can* control whether or not a label affects you. Who cares if you're bisexual or not? We surely don't!

**I'm more attracted to women one week, and men the next. Is there something wrong with me?**

Absolutely not! You're perfectly normal; this happens with both female and male bisexuals. It's called *fluidity of sexuality*. It means you feel attracted to one sex for a period of time, then switch subconsciously. For some people, this can be an urge when you're with your boyfriend to cuddle with a woman. For others, it means being in a long-term relationship with a man and then marrying a woman. It cannot be turned on or off; it ebbs and flows uncontrollably.

[LGBTerrific](http://www.reddit.com/user/LGBTerrific) brings up a great point about fluidity of sexuality: ""[Y]ou can be attracted to men more for sex, and women more romantically - or some other combination like that. They don't have to be same sort of attraction.""

AfterEllen posted a [great article](http://www.afterellen.com/people/2010/08/going-with-the-flow) about it and, although it focuses on celebrities, it still reigns true for everyday bisexuals. From the article:

&gt;[Candace] Walsh agreed, saying, ""The more we understand sexual fluidity, the more we see that things aren't so black and white.""

This is actually a huge topic that has been brought up for the past couple of years, sometimes for the first time in a lot of LGBT communities. It's being discussed, studied, and finally addressed. You are not alone.

**Am I pansexual?**

[Pansexuals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pansexual), also called *omnisexuals*, are a bit different than bisexuals. Pansexuals do not see gender or sex as a factor of attractiveness. A bisexual person may not be attracted to an [intersex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex) person, while a pansexual person may be--just to use an example. Pansexuals are also sometimes grouped in with bisexuals, which can cause pansexuals to suffer from *bisexual erasure* as well.

**Wait a second--what is bisexual erasure?**

For some reason, many people--in the LGBT community or otherwise--believe that bisexuality does not exist. Bisexuals are thought to be promiscuous, non-monogamous, or going through a ""phase"" by some heterosexuals. Sometimes in the queer community, bisexuals are thought to be inferior to gays or lesbians and are told to ""pick a side."" In some communities, bisexuals are alienated because they are ""able to have hetero-privileges.""

It's not right. It's a problem that needs fixing in the LGBT community, but we're on our way there. And luckily, it's in the minority.

**How do I begin to date the same sex?**

A great place to start would be [OKCupid](http://okcupid.com). It's free, you can browse profiles, and you can limit who you see, either the same or opposite sex. If you're willing to throw down money, [Match.com](http://match.com) has gotten good reviews and isn't dominated by one particular sex.

Another great route to go is to participate in local LGBT groups around your town. If you're a college student, check for a Stonewall group or LGBT alliance. If you're out of school, check for a local gay and lesbian community center, get involved with local LGBT issues or community building, and start going to LGBT events! I once met a cute girl when I helped paint our gay and lesbian community center in my town, and another when I attended a LGBTQ film festival one year.

The best way to get started is to just get out there! Put feelers out, take chances, and be confident!

**What other resources are out there for bisexuals?**

* [American Institute of Bisexuality](http://www.bisexual.org) -- great for educating yourself and others on bisexuality

* [Whosoever](http://www.whosoever.org/index.shtml) -- online magazine for LGBT Christians

*Let me know in the comments if you'd like me to add any more you know of!*

**The Bottom Line**

The conclusion here is that it ***doesn't matter what you are, who you are attracted to, or what you adhere to***. Labels *do not matter*. It is up to you, and only you, to decide whether or not you want to call yourself a bisexual, a pansexual, an omnisexual--but do not let these labels define you.

The LGBTQ--or QUILTBAG, if you so prefer--community is riddled with so many different *-sexual* prefixes, it's hard to keep up. There's even [affectional orientation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affectional_orientation)! But that's okay. Nobody here, or in any welcoming queer community, is going to judge you if you do or don't have a label.

The point is: **you don't have to be labeled ""bisexual"" to be a bisexual or to be apart of this community, online or off.**

I hope this helps anyone coming to r/bisexual looking for answers. :) We've all been through it. But instead of asking *us* whether or not you're bisexual, ask yourself: ""Why do I care if I call myself a bisexual or not?"" Sexuality is confusing, mind-blowing, and a journey all in its own. Enjoy it!

(xpost from /r/lgbt)",136,12,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1a3nfe/the_idea_of_coming_out_as_bisexual_to_my/,"I (a female) have been with my boyfriend for 6 years, and a few years ago have been battling with my bisexuality and my own discovery + acceptance with it. A few years ago I made out with a couple friends at a couple different parties and at the time I thought it wasn't a big deal, but my curiosity and sexual attraction towards women was exponentially growing after that. 

Well, I posted here, to /r/lgbt, and to /r/AskMen about a week ago looking for advice on what to do about my boyfriend. This was eating me alive, even though I never would have even contemplated leaving him, I was afraid of what his reaction would result in. I came to the conclusion that I had to tell him at some point, but the thought made me want to throw up. What would happen to us? What if it sparks jealousy with him and he's uncomfortable when I hang out with my girlfriends? What would it mean for me and my own security to come out to him? I mean, thinking it is one thing, but SAYING it out loud is completely different. It makes it real, and something you have to face. 

Well last night, we were watching tv, and the topic of lesbian and bisexual women came up and he dropped an atom bomb right there on the couch:

***""I think that if you weren't with me, you'd be with a woman.""***

WHOA. I was fucking *speechless*. My first instinct was to deflect. To try and laugh and brush it off: ""cheaaaaah- RIGHT."" But then with the confidence from all the comments I got from Reddit, I decided to dig more into it and we launched into this big conversation where he did most of the talking about the discoveries he's made about me that ultimately led to me asking him, ""Okay, so what do you think all that means?"" (Obviously knowing what it meant but wanted to leave it open-ended to discover his feelings about it.)

And he said, ""That you you're attracted to men, and you're attracted to women. And it's okay. It's nothing to be ashamed of, and I love you so much. I always will, and I will always do everything in my power to make sure you're happy.""

BAM. It's out there, and he knew from the time that I was questioning. It changed nothing, yet it changes everything. I'm so insanely comfortable with myself and I feel like I know who I am. I'm no longer lost. I am no longer confused. And it took my boyfriend to bring that out of me.

Here I am, not using a throwaway account. I've never loved my boyfriend more than I do now, and this sounds cliche, but I didn't know that it was possible. Shockingly it launched our relationship forward 100 steps. 

Sorry for the novel, I just wanted to take the time to thank you guys, and share my story. As of last night, nothing will ever be the same for me again, and I'm so extremely happy about that.

I read all the comments and to answer some questions and misconceptions..  

I do not and have never wanted to cheat on my wife.  I did not tell her to ask permission to have an open marriage.  I told her because she has a right to know about me and who I am.   We spent the first part of the morning  yesterday talking and both of us learning more about each other.  We talked about everything and basically reviewed our whole relationship.  We had had a rough patch 2 years ago.  We had talked about divorce then.  We spoke about then and how we had not really fixed anything or talked about it before.  We had just moved on.   More to the point of this post, She had the misconception that I was telling her in preparation to ask to explore my bisexuality more.  Once I had explained things and got her to understand where I was coming from and that I was always faithful and don't plan on that changing she was somewhat better.  

There was plenty of tears and hugging and it ending with her saying that she loves me and is going to need lots of reassurance in the coming days.  We both ended up calling out of work and spend the day laying in bed hugging, kissing, talking, crying, laughing.  By the end of the day we both had felt more open and intimate with each other that we had in years.

I know on the larger scale of things our little 10 year marriage is new, but after yesterday and last night, I think we are going to be ok.   The first post was wrote first thing in the morning after a lot of yelling and crying the night before when I first told her.

",136,18,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/u87ne/please_do_not_make_bisexuals_feel_inadequate/,"I was hosting a party for and invited my niece (K) and couple of friends over. During the party one of my friend's friends decided to give K a lecture on bisexuality and how it's just a state of denial. This happened while I was in the backyard. One of my friends told me about the exchange which I confirmed after seeing K looking uncomfortable afterwards.

I invited said guest to a brunch the next day where I promptly laid her shit down which is summarized in an ironed-out clean transcript below:  

X we've known each other for years now. Not as close friends, but acquaintances. Though we've had our ups-and-downs in the past, we've managed to coexist peacefully in the same general lesbian circle of friends for a while which seems to work out really well for the both of us and I'd like to keep it that way.

This time it's different. You fucked up.

You and I both know the stereotypes of bisexuals and how in your words they ""fuck up the system"". Well stereotypes are stereotypes and unfortunately for bisexuals it hurts them more than it helps them.

Having said that, you DO NOT get to tell my 17-year-old niece that her bisexuality is a sham. I will not stand idly by while someone makes her feel ashamed for who she is or how she feels. So what if she falls in love with one of her friends after dumping her long-term boyfriend? That's HER choice. She doesn't need to justify her actions to anyone - not to her mother, not to me, and especially not to you. If she wasn't at the party yesterday, I would've definitely kicked your ass.

She's a good kid. A straight-A student, class president, captain of the swim team, and bunch of other shit that would make any hardass Asian parent proud. Yesterday was one of the rare occasions I saw her hurt because of her sexuality. Do you realize how much fucking work it takes to make a person like her? A Fucking Ton.

* If you wake up one morning with little to no attraction to a gender, don't panic and think you're suddenly gay/straight. Bisexuals ""flip-flop"" sometimes. It's normal.

Now it's incredibly active, with a superb group of people posting and commenting.  I'm further excited to be working with some great mods who are, in turn, working with the community to keep this place wonderful.  Before I lose the usage of adjectives without repeating myself for how spledid of a subreddit this is, I'd like to move on to another topic.

With this 5000 milestone, what would everyone's view of flair be?  Is this something the group wants?  Fully editable, or just a few custom groups that people can select from?  We can even try to get some images - perhaps if people want to use various pride flags?  I'd have to look into how to do that.

Also, while we're at it - what do you want to see in /r/bisexual?  There's a FAQ in progress.  We can change the look of the group, or keep it default reddit.  We can add flair.  We can do lots of stuff.  Please comment with any suggestions.

TL;DR Told my wife I like guys and she said ""big deal"".

I checked the rules and long rambling tlaes don't seem to be against the rules, so I included the TL;DR because I have the feeling this is a pretty average story but I was so happy all day I wanted to share and I don't know think my freinds would give the reaction I want.  As they don't know.

If you want to get past the generic background I'll put a line in so you know where to skip to.

I come from a catholic family we are mostly to the democratic side of the spectrum but in a very we accept that *others* may do different things.  

When I was in my early teens I had a decent idea something was up and had a decent idea of sex so that I could express myself.  Which I did not do but that is just the midwest in the late 90's-early 2000's.  When I was in my later teens I would test the waters by talking about gay rights or bringing home *Out* magazine and then when questioned claiming I was just so into politics.  Being an awkward teen is hilarious in retrospect but hard at the time. I would go to the librairy and use the internet to post on LGBT forums.  This was in the days of AOL so we didn't even have the internet at the time.  When I hit 18 I was subsriced to The Nation and Mother Jones and every so often would get ""gay"" junk mail which again I could shrug off as political junk mail.  

I was again awkward still and didn't think things out very well so I decided to come out to my older sister who had a few gay friends in an email.  I didn't hear back from her about it.  I would pick up bits of in the other room converation where she and my mother disscussed that her gay friends felt I was confused and would be gay eventually.  I felt pretty betrayed and clamed up about it.

I went to college and tryed to tell a good freind that I had a man crush on.  I ended up rambling about unrelated things for a half an hour and didn't bring it up again.  I told a couple other freinds and the rumor mill churned but no-one wanted to acknowlede it.  At one point my RA told me I was on the unofficial HS list. (homo-suspicion).  The thing is I am not at all effeminate or  ""gay-acting"" so I picked up pretty quick again that the rumor went around but no-one really wanted to acknowledge it out loud.  I told a gay friend and he got upset at me for being bi and not straight or gay.


****************************************************************

So with the way things have gone I was not very comfortable talking to my wife about it.  I made an occasional joke about giving out handjobs (its a long hilarious inside joke that I don't know if I can explain here) but never really talked about it.  At one point while we were dating I hinted kind of heavily and she asked if I was gay and instead of turning it into a conversation I just backed out.  So I a few times she tried to broach the subject and I played it off.  

So two nights ago during sex she asked me if I found men atractive and I told her if we weren't married I wouldn't have a problem having sex or a relationship with a man.  And she said as long as you don't cheat on me I don't care.  Best wife ever.

More accurate TL;DR Through a combination of awkwardness and other peoples attitudes coming out has always gone horribly wrong.  My wife handles this by coaxing me out of the closet just so she can tell me she doesn't care as long as I follow the same no cheating rules that apply to women.

I havn't felt so relaxed in my own skin maybe ever.

I hang around a lot of queer folx and have a lot of queer friends but I rarely talk about my sexuality.  My gay male friend saw me reading a lesbian poetry book and he said ""oh are you queer"" and I responded ""yes"" and he asked ""what do you identify as?"" I said I don't like classifying myself (although I am bisexual). And he responded ""well don't say you are queer when you are not, you don't know what it is like.""

Yeah, I don't know what it is like.  I have been going to lesbian chat rooms since 8th grade.  I have hated myself, first for being attracted to women, then for being attracted to men.  When I came out to my parents as bisexual they asked ""are you sure you aren't a lesbian?""  Yeah I don't know what it is like.  All of these beautiful butch girls never even look at me because it is ""just a phase.""  My first girlfriend said ""you would be perfect, if only you were lesbian"" as if saying ""you would be perfect if only you were white"" would be tolerated by any other minority.  Yeah I don't know what it is like.

And the thing that pisses me off most is that this guy is so against gender-policing, but sexuality policing is ok? No both are wrong! Every time I ask a gay and lesbian activist what they are doing for the bisexual community they respond ""well gay rights are bi rights."" Not when you don't recognize us as existing.

It is bad enough the self-appointed spokesperson, Dan Savage, of LGBT individuals doesn't thing bisexuality is a real thing. [""well most bisexuals are in heterosexual relationships...""](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/bisexuals/Content?oid=8743322)
  Maybe that is because you treat us so shitty!

At first I was skeptical because I've never done anything with a guy. ..Against all odds someone messages me. We shared very similar likes and dislikes. We chat on okcupid for a while. Eventually I get a number and we start talking more and more. Then we realize we enjoy talking with one another so much that we decided to meet up. We grab lunch and walk around outside for a few hours. (I just want to remind you that I have never done this before with someone of the same sex so I was very nervous and thrilled at the same time.) More time passes and we end up in his car. We had somehow become so attracted to one another that we just started making out right there. I was hesitant to at first because it was all new to me. I didn't know what to expect. As soon as we started making out though a void inside of me filled up and It was amazing! The experience was so different than what I was accustomed to. The roughness of his hands compared to the soft tender hands of the women I've dated. His stubble felt so different and so welcoming against my lips even though I've never had that before. It just felt right. Afterwards we just held each other. I really liked holding him then. It wasn't the petite frame I'm used to and he smelled so different from a woman but I absolutely loved it. I'm so glad that new doors have been opened to me and I love this community of redditors for being themselves and sharing their stories. It helped me and I hope it does for many other people.

Now I'm pissed because I'm getting a ton of comments saying ""Well if you say you're bi in a relationship it sounds like you're going to cheat"" and ""If you say you're bi in a relationship you're telling the person they're not good enough"" and ""You're straight or gay in a relationship because a relationship means you chose someone"".

Anyway... I'm just so pissed at these people right now. I knew the ""when you're in a relationship you're instantly not bi"" was a thing, but I had no idea that there are people out there who believe that saying ""I'm bisexual""=""I want someone other than you"". Ughhhh. I just can't believe how much people suck.

I guess that's what happens when you go up in an AskReddit thread. People are mean.

I'm really thankful now that my boyfriend is super supportive of LGBT rights and likes to talk about me being bi.

Anyway... If you see an AskReddit thread with under 200 comments, don't post anything about being bi in it unless you want to deal with trolls and assholes. :P (Edit: I'm not trying to say that we shouldn't be out and post about it.

My family has always been very catholic, very homophobic, always insulting people of the same sex that even hold hands or show some affection in public so, it was pretty hard for me coming clean about it.

I used to live with my sister, i tell i used cause when she find out she told me i could not be in her house anymore, that my ""living style"" was something to be embarassed and ashame. She did not want any more woman coming in the house ( i pay rent by the way but the contract it's on her name so...) Now i'm moving.

Before she told my parents i decide to tell them first, it was like a BOMB, they told me it was like someone just said i was death. They not suppport that ""life style"", they don't think it's normal. The last words my mom told me was "" I hope you change your mind and really think about the stupid thing you're doing, you are putting everyone of us in a very shame position. I also hope you find a man that can make you happy even with this thing"" then they left ( we were at a restaurant, it was very intense, everyone were staring at me, i almost cry) :(

I'm kind of sad my family don't understand any of this but i'm also feeling happy cause i don't have to hide anything anymore, i'm not dating anyone but i'm glad now i can date whoever i want :)

Along with the usual rants from the ""you're going to hell crowd,"" there were some interesting posts. There were articles from wives who had caught their husbands cheating; letters to sex therapists asking what's wrong with them and if their husband wants to be humped in the ass; and my personal favorite, ""my slut husband."" 

Well, I'm a bisexual guy married to a wonderful heterosexual woman. I wanted to weigh-in with my 2 cents on this whole issue. I thought the best way to do this would be to take your through a typical Saturday in my life. I could tell you about a work day, but since I work from 9-5, that would be even more boring.

Here are some basic facts about us. I'm a professional, 35 year old, masculine American white guy. You would never know I was bi if you met me. I'm married to a beautiful 33 year old Greek girl who knows that I'm bisexual. My wife's kink is that she likes to be dominated, although she'll never admit it. The irony of me being bi and her being Greek is not lost on her. We have 3 great kids who drive us crazy.


Saturday:

6:30 am:
Baby crying. I'm the lighter sleeper between my wife and I. This means that I get up. I put a blanket on the baby and thankfully, she goes back to sleep.

7:00 am:
Multiple kids awake. Arrg!!! Our day has started. We make breakfast, turn on a cartoon (no more than 1/2 hour), make coffee and read the newspaper. The kids play.

9:00 am:
My oldest kid has swim practice. There's a skirmish about who has to drop her off. I win based on having blanketed the baby.

9:30 am:
Shower time. My two year old catches me trying to take a shower by myself. She gives me this look that declares her ownership of the shower and its usage. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Now, I'm gonna have to constantly fill up cups of water for her play with.

10:00 am
Pick up kid from swim practice.

11:00 am
Get horny. I signal this state of arousal to my wife. Only married couples with children can truly understand this barbaric behavior. I feel like a baboon female raising her ass in heat. Before children, I wooed my wife with subtle touching and caresses of love. Now, kids have forced me to display my true primate nature.

11:05 am:
Thank God for Netflix and Dora the Explorer. We have timed sex and Dora only gives us 22 minutes. We run to the bedroom, lock the door and get undressed. I'm not a selfish fuck, pun intended. I pull out my wife's vibrator. I get her off but lose precious minutes in doing so. The clock is ticking. It's my turn and I'm up to bat. My wife is clean so this means I can do what I love most. I go down on her while the vibrator is still there. She moans. I flip her over so that her ass is up. I eat her this way too. I know this makes her feel like a nasty whore but she loves it too. I enter her doggy style and thrusts for about 2-3 minutes. I feel the cum rising like a volcano. I could pull-out now and delay gratification for another 10 minutes but there is no time. THERE IS NO TIME. Instead, I decide to finish strong. I slam her ass like there's no tomorrow. We both collapse into a sweaty pile of panting.

11:30 am:
Kids at the door, banging to get in. The castle is about to be breached.

noon-5 pm:
Extended family barbeque. We eat and drink too much. Greeks are a very hospitable people. I try to help clean but my mother-in-law gives me too much grief to continue. I have also been impressed with the Greeks' confidence in their culture and customs. Many ethnic groups, here in America, feel the need to express their uniqueness. Thankfully, my in-laws lack this need, but that's for another post. The only thing of note is that gay marriage does come up as a topic of discussion. The older generation is against it; the younger one for it, (big surprise here). They don't know I'm bi. Part of me feels guilty for not telling them. I think part of the problem is that too many of us are silent.

6 pm:
Make and eat dinner.

7-9 pm:
Read with kids. The oldest is amazing. She can read 2 years above her grade. The middle one is a stubborn donkey who refuses to learn his ABC's. Play with kids in back-yard. Put pajamas on kids and gear up for the bedtime war.

9 pm:
Read book or watch movie with wife.

11 pm:
Go to bed.

That's it folks. A day in the life of low-down, dirty bisexual husband. :- )

We were drinking and laughing together and she kissed me. And then one thing led to another and she expressed interest in wanting to have a threesome.

Well, my boyfriend and I were over the moon and went home and made some really sexy times.

Seeing him with another girl was hot. Really hot. And he even was into seeing me pleasure another girl. 

I'm so happy that my relationship is at this point and that I have been able to ""be queer"" for one night. I've been in a boy-girl relationship for so long that I'm just so happy to be a silly girl with another silly girl again.

You can find the comments [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/19e5to/er_thats_not_a_sexual_orientation/).

I identify as bi, I also identify as pan, I'm attracted to the full gender spectrum but I prefer to say bi because its better understood by the mainstream community and I like that it unifies all sexually fluid people under one [umbrella](http://drynwhyl.deviantart.com/art/The-bisexual-umbrella-269963982).  To me, it is like what ""trans*"" is for transgender and genderqueer individuals, it is inclusive of everyone who fits the broad definition. 

I know there are bisexuals who do find only men and women attractive and that's a totally valid identity that falls under the bi umbrella but in real life there is so much variety and 90% of the people I know who identify as bi are attracted to non-binary identities as well.  I have a friend who is genderqueer and they have a bi girlfriend and the girlfriend deals with bi invisibility all the time because when her partner is gendered as male on some days people call her straight and on other days when her partner is gendered as female she is considered gay.  Bisexuals deal with enough discrimination outside the community, do we really need this policing from within?

If you assumed that someone who was bi was only attracted to cismen and ciswomen you would be wrong 95% of the time.  Yet people continue to say this to myself and others of the community.  It doesn't make any sense to me, I choose the label that worked best for me and I GET to define it for myself.  Even if you do think bi = two then really it is a combination of homo and hetero which really means that you like those two identities which are the same gender and a different gender then yourself.

I think pan is a lovely label and if someone decides to call themselves pan that's perfectly fine, I do too on some days.  But pan is not a separate identity per say, it is a specific identity that falls within the bisexual umbrella.  I see it like the difference between a rectangle and a square.  By definition a square is also a rectangle, but a rectangle is not always a square.

Sorry about my rant, I'm just angry that people have been telling my identity is wrong for the past few days, I wanted a little support from within the community and I wanted to hear your thoughts on this kind of identity policing.",EXPERIENCE,False,,t5_2qwnx,1362240662.0,,bi,True,t3_19iy7h,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/19iy7h/identity_policing_im_so_sick_of_this_bullshit/,

I've dated a good number of women over the past decade. I loved each of their quirks and personalities; I'd had what I thought was a good sex life. About 8 months ago, I broke up with the last SO i had, after living with her for nearly a year.

Sadly, it's taken until then for me to finally say fuck all to the world and find a guy to have some fun with. Before seeing a guy, I thought I liked men sexually and wouldn't find much worthwhile romantically / emotionally with a man. Turns out, every single one of my thoughts, conceptions, and hopes were thrown overboard!

I met this guy on OKCupid and we decided to meet up for lunch and possible drinks if it went well. All said and done, it was 7 hours later before we both realized we should call it a night because of work in the morning! Seriously, I spent 7 hours just talking with him. That was probably the most fun I've ever had on a date in my life, simply taking the time to get to know him and sharing interests.

I've gone out with him a few more times and decided to stay over at his place this past monday. Me, the retard when it comes to dating, thought he actually intended to go to sleep when he said we needed to go to bed ... work in the morning.

He came out of the bathroom and pounced on me! All said and done it was two hours later before we went to bed. It was the most fun, sensual, agressive sex I've ever had. I'm kicking myself I waited this long!

So, I have conversations with people, and I'll let it slip that I'm bisexual. This primarily happens with men, because I have this fear of women taking the whole ""I'm sometimes attracted to women thing"" the wrong way and not wanting my company. And from then on, to most heterosexual men, all I am is a sex object. They make comments about threesomes, or ask for a recount of all of my experiences, and ask me for very detailed opinions of each woman in the room (moreso than my opinions on the men). It's like the moment they find out I have the ability to look past gender, I'm not even human in their eyes anymore--a walking fantasy or something. Just an anomaly to whom they can ask all sorts of invasive personal questions.

I was talking to my sister over the phone, who's getting married next month. We were talking about stuff going on with me since she lives eight hours away. I told her how today's been pretty shitty with all of the Chick-fil-A talk, finding out how many people on my Facebook friends list are actually homophobic and ""can't stand faggots"" (one guy's words). Not to mention the three times the word ""faggot"" has been said to me today -- at the grocery store, the gas station, and the convenience store. People are just *really, loudly* homophobic today thanks to all of this.

So I mentioned to her how I was feeling, and how I was thinking about coming out to our parents. We both live in the South -- her deeper than I in Georgia -- but our parents are pretty liberal. My sister is probably the most conservative out of the bunch.

""Coming out how?"" she asked.

""You know... as bisexual!"" I said. I thought I had told her years ago already, but her tone of voice was telling me otherwise.

""This... is news to me!""

I told her about my mistaken thought that I had come out to her already, and she denied me ever doing so. I suddenly felt my heart skip a beat, since I had just come out to her fairly nonchalantly.

""I don't care,"" she said. ""You love who you love. I don't think of you any different. To be honest, it's not a big surprise. I think I had a feeling.""

I was really ecstatic. She also told me her fiance has a *gay brother!* Totally unaware, but that tells me he's accepting of the LGBT community too. Later on during the conversation, I told her about how I was worried that my nieces (and baby nephew) would grow up bigoted or close-minded because of their environment in Georgia. And she said:

""No, we don't raise them like that. They know people are who they are and they're gonna love whoever and that's how it's gonna be."" She suddenly got really excited: ""Savannah has so many gays! Yeah, it's totally up there on the gay-friendly lists.""

1356023012.0,88,self.bisexual,156asw,I'm 40 and finally came out officially to my husband and best friend.  Because of you all.,103,15,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/156asw/im_40_and_finally_came_out_officially_to_my/,"Ok, so I have been bisexual since I was young.  However, I am 40 and in a fully committed marriage, completely monogamous.  So during this time I found this subreddit.  I was inspired by the stories, heart broken by the bad things, joyous about the good.  But one theme that went on and on was 'bisexuals aren't taken seriously by any side, it is so hard to be bisexual'

This made me pause.  Partially because, by reddit standards, I am the generation before you.  Also, because I never really 'came out'.  I dated both men and women, but the women were on the down low except for a few years where I was surrounded by like minded people.  However, for the most part, to everyone who knew me, I was straight.

Reading some of the difficult stories on here I realized more bisexuals like me coming out would have helped you all in this generation coming out.  I sat and thought about that a long time.  I never hid my past, but it wasn't a big topic of discussion either.  So, I sat my husband down and had this conversation:

Me: So, you know I used to date women right?

Him: Yes

Me: Well, I wanted to say officially that I am bisexual, but monogamous.  So I might fantasize about a woman on occasion, but I would never cheat on you.  [insert long explanation about the subreddit and my feelings here]

Him: Ok.  I think it is shitty that people have to be afraid to be who they are

Me: Me too


***********************


Cut to me hanging out with my best friend. I wanted to make reference to something I read here, but I realized that I couldn't do that without outing the fact that I subscribe to '/r/bisexual'... Should I come out to her too? 

I did.  She, too, knew I had dated women in my past, but I don't think she really realized or thought about who I might fantasize about (hint, not her lol!)  To make a long story short, she used to date women as well, and we both realized the men we picked were unusually stereotypically feminine in some ways.  The perfect type of partner. 

So, I know it probably seems like a little step here, coming out to people who kind of already knew (without putting it in words) but for me, who kept much of my life hidden from my family and friends, it was a relief to say it.  Yes I am bisexual.  No, that doesn't make me polyamorous. No, I am not someone trying to get attention.  Have I kissed women in bars?  In my youth, sure.  Just like kissing a man in a bar.  But I have also loved women deeply.  Shared relationships with them.  It was just so much easier to follow societies expectations and marry a man.  As is often said by gay men and women, why would someone choose to be an outcast in society?  Admittedly, I did not want to be that outcast.  And I made some choices that I now regret.

To all of you brave enough to come out, bravo.  I am in awe of your strength.  Thank you for listening to me ramble.

I was just at the bar and this super cute guy comes up and sits next to me. Just as he walks up this girl I've had my eye on for awhile comes in. At this point I'm conflicted because there are two super hot people trying to by me drinks and take me home. It must be because it was a sunny day and we don't get many of those. Something was in the air last night.

Anyway I ended up making out with the girl, got her number and took the cute boy home. He immediately ripped my clothes off and started to kiss me. I didn't expect to feel that way. To have a man take charge of me. I did feel really great. Didn't go all the way with him but it was a very pleasurable first experience. I never thought sucking another guy's cock would feel that way. I would do it again!

It's happened to me many times.  I just get so bored and miss the other that I always make mistakes.

To clarify, I am out to my close circle of friends, and my partner. I never, ever lie about my identity or refer to myself as straight. I also don't volunteer the information to those outside that inner circle. I live someplace where you can still be legally discriminated against (fired, etc.) for being non-straight, and violence against LGBTQ people is not uncommon here.

I plan on being open with her about it, but it would probably make her life harder if I was open to everyone about it. A big part of me also feels like I should be open precisely because I have a daughter who will be looking to me as a role model. 
I also don't fancy the criticisms and questions about my sex life that would arise, and feel like a lot of people on both sides (hetero and LGBTQ) will see me as fake.

I've noticed recently an influx of transphobic language.  Now, I don't believe that anyone is saying anything with malice, but intentions mean little if you actually offend someone.  Here are a few guidelines when talking about trans* people.

* When writing about people outside the gender binary, a generally accepted umbrella term is ""trans*""  The asterisk acts as a wildcard, allowing the phrasing to mean transgender, transsexual, trans man, trans woman, or any other identity under the trans umbrella.
* Fetishising trans* people is rude.  Though many people want to feel ""wanted"" sexually, many trans* people view the sexualization of their struggle demeaning.  If you would like a place on reddit to look at or talk about sexy trans* people, there are subreddits for that.
* Talking about the genitals or secondary sex traits of trans* people is rude.  Not only might a trans woman not want to be reminded that she has not had ""bottom surgery,"" but she might not refer to her genitals by traditional nomenclature that is inherently male-gendered.  I have heard many different terms used by trans* people to describe their gentials: cocklit, t-dick, manhole, front hole, venis, funparts, stuff, junk, bits, jam, click (or clik), meatshape.  Because comments about genitals can be dysmorphic, I suggest we adopt a subreddit-wide standard for gender-neutral gentials: ""frits"" (a contraction of ""front bits,"" I believe coined by /u/mxtery)

Most of my friends are male, and it's so much harder coming out to women than it is to men for me, and developing close relationships with women is generally a lot more difficult than with men. So he started asking more questions, things like ""How do you define feminine?"" and ""Do you feel more masculine than feminine? Do you wish you were a guy?"" and eventually wound up saying this:

&gt; Look, you're bi. Women are uncomfortable with it because they want men. They don't understand it, so they run. You're afraid of rejection. The problem is, **you see outside of gender and body parts. You have something deeper than that.** You see all people for everything attractive they have and you don't even know it. You can see beauty from both sides and you think it's a curse. **It's a blessing.**

I guess the reason it stuck out to me is because I never realized that my problem with the conventionality of ""gender"" is that I'm bisexual. Thinking about it some more, it makes sense that I can't identify wholly with one gender, because monosexuals have one gender they identify with and one gender they're attracted to, so as bisexuals, it makes sense that we're attracted to both and identify with both.

So, I just wanted to pass that really eye-opening quote on to you guys here, especially since it seems like this subreddit has many younger people looking for answers.",DISCUSSION,False,,t5_2qwnx,False,,,True,t3_ytnuw,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/ytnuw/my_friend_said_something_really_insightful_last/,

It's the old ""bi does not necessarily equal gender-binary""-vent.

So, today someone on an online community I hang out at posted a ""Pansexuality FAQ""-type thing, and the second question was ""isn't that basically the same as bisexual"" to which she replied that it's not because bisexual people aren't attracted to trans* individuals. Now, I have nothing against people preferring to call themselves pan over bi, and I have nothing against individuals who are in fact only attracted to cis individuals, but it really rubs me the wrong way when people make such generalizing statements about who you can be attracted to if you're bi. 

When I started calling myself bi as a teen it wasn't because I'd realized that I liked people out of box A and out of box B but not anyone else, it was because I'd realized that I was neither gay nor straight. Bi was the only third option I was aware of, the term pan either hadn't been invented yet or at least hadn't become widespread enough that I knew about it. I've always been comfortable identifying as bi and I don't see a reason to change it just because some other people are not comfortable identifying as bi. 

The thing is, people were attracted to trans* people before ""pansexuality"" existed, and chances are that back then a lot of those people called (and still call) themselves bi. There seems to sometimes be an implication that pansexuality as introduced a concept that didn't exist before in the bi community or elsewhere, and I find that rather silly. It has introduced a term, which some like and some dislike, but it has not introduced the occurrence to which the term refers. Therefor, I don't believe that the introduction of the new term (pansexuality) voids those definitions of the old term (bisexuality) which include attraction to non-cis individuals.

And before someone says ""but, Bi- means two-"": etymology =/= meaning. If it did, we'd all have to go around telling vegetarians that they eat meat daily, and I think that would piss them off. 

I'm attracted to certain (physical and mental) traits. Some of these are more common in people identifying as female, some are more common in people identifying as male. Some are equally common in all sorts of people. If enough of these traits turn up in the same person, and in a combination I find pleasing, I am attracted to that person, no matter their gender identity. I call myself bi because it was the first word I learned which seemed to fit me in this regard, because I see it used to encompass a variety of preferences including my own, because many people know about it, and because I've never seen a reason replace it with something else. Just because others might have a different definition or associations to the word, that doesn't make my definition wrong (nor, I think, is it that uncommon a definition).

Somebody in a post I read recently said something like ""I'm attracted to people who are like me, and people who are different from me"". Perhaps I should start using this when people insist I must be attracted to only two categories in order to call myself bi.

I had come to the realization that there was an important part of myself that I had not shared with her, let alone anyone else. 

It was something that could potentially change how she felt about me forever. It was a terrifying thought, but it was something I felt like I could not divulge and her really know me. It wasn't something that was new to me, it just really had not been on my mind because I'd been so wrapped up in my new relationship with her.

When we got home, I asked her to sit down and with tears rolling down my face I admitted to the woman that I loved that I was bisexual and that I was telling her this simply because I wanted her to really know me, to be able to have an honest relationship with her, and to be accepted as I am. I was still not looking for anything more than a monogamous loving relationship with her.

To say that she was shocked was an understatement. It was a long night with a lot of questions and tears and I felt terrible for the distress I had caused her. But even worse, I didn't know if I had just ruined my marriage by telling the truth or not. She got drunk.

The next day, she had thought about what I had said and the answers to the 20 million questions she had asked and decided that at the end of the day I was still the same great person I was before I told her and she never looked back.

I consider myself lucky to have a spouse as supportive as she has been. With her help I eventually was able to share this part of myself with the rest of my family and many of my friends. I have grown as a person because of her acceptance instead of hating a secret part of what makes me who I am.

It hasn't all been hugs and acceptance from people. I have had my share of bigotry from both straight and gay people. As somebody who considers themselves moral, good, and likes to please others, this was a little hard to take at first. I have been called faggot by people I love, I have been told I am really gay by gay people that should know better, and I have been told I should not be proud of who I am. 

Still, I would not change the day. I can't really stop someone from hating me, or projecting their feelings and experiences to me but I can feel secure in knowing who I am and being proud of it.

Many of you already know this story, for those of you that are learning this now or just having your suspicions confirmed I apologize for not getting to it sooner. There is a fine line between telling people when appropriate and just walking around putting it in people's faces, but at the same time not wanting to feel like you are hiding. Being married to the opposite sex makes it easy to just let people assume you are 100% straight. I am only about 80%.

So why am I telling this now? Well, if the person I had fallen in love with would have been a guy, it breaks my heart to think that I could not have enjoyed being married to them and all of the perks that go along with that just because of somebody else's religious beliefs and I wish that joy to anyone who wants it.

Out of no where one of them turned around and started screaming at me to leave.

I just recently moved back home, and broke up with my boyfriend. One of the reasons I broke up with him was because he wasn't very supportive. He slowly began not to trust me, and every friendship I had male or female he at some time accused me of having sex with and cheating on him. So I moved home to live with my extremely conservative mother. Who I told because my ex threatened to tell her if I didn't. After crying, telling me I'm wrong, and pushing herself into extreme denial she says : ""whatever, just no gays in the house"". Which of course, hurt really bad considering I'm living in the damn house. So I'm trying to find a job here and get back on my feet but I'm so sad all the time because I have no friends. As a result I contact one of the girls who I grew up with. She has helped set me up with a job in the future working with her at a daycare. And, we have been talking on the surface of things but in a friendly manner. Anyway, I've hung out with them after changing how I identify and I always feel horrible for not telling them. They're very touchy feely people. Always hugging and being overly flirtatious. It's awkward for me because I felt like every touch made it that much harder. Who wants to be like ""I like girls"" to a straight girl right after they've gotten undressed in front of you etc? So, I told her. And I did it by asking if she was planning on going to Pride. She was all excited at first and wanted to plan something with me. Then I decided to open up and let her know I really appreciated having a friend come with because no one has been supportive of my recent coming out, and I'm literally going to pride to try and help me get some pride about it. No response. Nothing. It's been a day. I know she saw the message. I know she isn't replying on purpose. So, I send an apology letter. I tell her I didn't mean to make anything awkward, and if she has any questions to feel free to ask me. Still nothing. So even though I am so broke I'm selling a couple things to make it to pride, I'm probably not going to take that job. And my mom who has been helping with my bills won't be happy to hear ""it's"" caused more trouble in my life.

1373192584.0,79,self.bisexual,1hsp4f,In love with my [f]riend for 17 years. 36/married/mother. Confessions &amp; details of what happened and what I want to happen...,103,24,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1hsp4f/in_love_with_my_friend_for_17_years/,"I just feel like getting all of this off my chest in some fashion. I feel like writing it out will give me some release since I have been carrying these feelings for a very long time. Only two people know any of this (her and my husband) and I am tired of not discussing/acknowledging these feelings.  I don't care if anyone responds, I just really want to ""say"" all of this to let it out. I will be going into explicit detail...probably so much so as to be able to relive some of the moments as I recall them up from memory.  I will be happy to answer any questions -- I don't mind getting anonymously personal about any of the details. Ask away or just enjoy the read, FWIW. 


I am 36, female, been married for 10 years and am a mother of 3 year old twins.  My husband and I are monogamous, I have never cheated on my husband, and we are both very sexually compatible. I absolutely love sex with him, love him, love our life together, see us together forever, and all that jazz. But, I'm also in love with my female friend from high school.  And he knows it. So does she.




When I was in 8th grade, I changed schools when my parents divorced. I had to start making friends all over again from the ground up. It was hard; at my previous school, I was a part of the ""in"" crowd and had tons of friends. In the new school, I met my friend Jenn and we became instant best friends. We were inseparable until I left for college. 




High school together was a blast. We were girly girls together through-and-through. We were joined at the hip. We would have sleepovers and hang out all the time and we were both each others complete inner-circle of friends. We each had other friends -- many of the same -- but nobody was as tight as we were.



Jenn and I were always very flirtatious -- with guys...and with each other. But not so with any other girls. There was just a chemistry between us. We both knew it but never acted upon it.




Jenn has so many great attributes that I still love about her, even though I haven't seen her in 17 years. Physically: she has long blonde hair (like me), a petite frame at 5' 3"" (also like me), she has an amazing body with a tiny waist and feminine hourglass hips, has a killer smile and can convey an entire conversation with just her eyes.  Her looks make me wet alone, and how she uses those eyes...how she peers through them.  Oh, and she has FANTASTIC breasts. I was always in awe of them. I loved seeing her in her bikini when we would sit around her pool. She would lay out for hours and I loved staring at her and those womanly breasts and tiny waist from behind my sunglasses. I think she always knew I was checking her out...as she seemed to coyly play it up, for my enjoyment. Her boobs have got to be cup size C or D. Mine are a small A (IF that) which is probably why I loved hers so much (since I felt like mine never 'came in'...and I still feel that way).  





She's overtly sexual in nature. In that 'Marilyn Monroe' sort of way...she just oozes sex. I love the match in prowess that I found in her.  She was the kind of girl that you would assume was very promiscuous, because of how sexual she came off. But, she wasn't and I liked that shyness about her.  She remained a virgin until college.  (I was also sexually conservative with how many partners I had and to this day am still on only 2 hands -- though I lost my virginity at 16 and was always ""ahead"" of her in that department, not that anyone would have ever assumed that.)  





Emotionally: I loved her attitude and her personality.  She was warm and kind and funny and has a great laugh. She also had a realness or depth to her friendship that always felt genuine. But she's also moody and a little bitchy/mildly stuck-up at times. I love that too. In fact, it draws me to her more than a person that only sees rainbows and sunshine and goodness in every person they meet. (It comes off shallow.) But not Jenn. Much like in a ""Miss Piggy sort of way"" where you know she can be moody and temperamental but it draws you in even more...wanting to win her over, pull her out, and break through that temperamental moody shell of an attitude, when it appeared. I liked the challenge. Personality-wise, we just clicked symbiotically.





The extent of our ""relationship"" throughout high school was nothing more than super-best-friends with an undertone of borderline wanting to take it to the next level but neither of us did or even dare mention it. The most that ever happened was flirtatious tickle fights or gifting each other girl-next-door-but-still-sexy nightgowns from Victoria's Secret. But I think deep inside, we both knew we were very connected...but would never bring it up. Call it naïveté, nerves, shyness, or insecurity that maybe one of us was reading into it more than the other.  



After graduation, I went 3 hrs away to college and she went to the college in our hometown.  Going away to college was exciting and a new adventure that I looked forward to, but I could tell she missed me and had some jealousy of new friends I made or the new boyfriend I POURED myself into, including my attention -- that usually went to her. I missed her too. I loved seeing her when I would come home. Our reunions were always as if nothing changed. Our favorite movie was Threesome.





The summer after freshman year took her to Denver on an internship for the summer.  I don't know how it came about, but she was going to be living in an apartment out there (out on her own for the first time) and I was going to go with her. The summer was going to be a blast.  





She went out first and got an apartment and started her internship and I joined her a few weeks later. When I got to Denver, I unpacked my suitcase in her studio apartment and quickly found a job waitressing. I had a car payment to make...my newfound adult responsibilities to yield to. She would work, I would work, and we would have fun just being buds in our off hours. We would go shopping, to the movies, trek the mall scoping out hot guys...all the usual best friend stuff. I loved it. And so did she. She loved having me out there and my attention I gave to her. 






My favorite part was her studio apartment. Having no luxury of another room or even a den, we shared her bed...A full-sized black fouton which was low to the ground and instantly felt more intimate.  I secretly loved that. I had no ""agenda"", per se, but after years of being drawn to her, I was ecstatic to be by her side at night. Night after night.





It was after I had been there for only a few days when the change in our relationship was about to take place.  That summer was unusually hot or maybe we just weren't used to that dry heat. One night was almost unbearable and she didn't have A/C. We went to bed, turned off the lights, opened the windows, and laid there. It was hot. I was hot. She was hot. We were both getting sweaty.  So the covers come off. Now we are laying side by side without the tacit barrier of even just a thin sheet separating us. We were both in skimpy nightgowns. I remember navy/white polka dots for her while I was in a hot pink short number she gave me a few years earlier.  (Which I still have, by the way.)  But it was still too much on our bodies.  I don't remember which of us did it first, but after a few minutes, our clothes came off...in the name of getting cooler, of course. I think I initiated it by taking mine off first. Naturally, I said something to blame it on the heat, but secretly, my mind was racing with the possibility of how this could naturally progress and unfold.





Delicately, I tossed and turned like I couldn't get comfortable. Probably to spark conversation with her and signal I was not yet asleep (far from it). I remember her being more still. She was probably nervous. Anxious, but nervous. Nothing like this was ever mentioned between us before so we were in uncharted territories, testing the boundaries of our friendship.





I remember finally settling into a ""comfortable"" position -- facing her, laying on my side. And then there they were. Her enormous breasts glowing in the moonlight that was shining through the open window. I remember simply staring at them, like a 13 year old boy glimpsing at his first porno mag.  It took me what felt like an hour to finally muster the courage to say something to her. I asked her if I could touch them. She softly said, ""yes.""  So I did. I touched them. I caressed them. I squeezed them. I had never felt anything like them. No part of my own body had that texture. Her skin was smooth like a cross between satin and velvet. And they were soft.  Soft when I pushed them in, soft when I gently squeezed them, and had an alluring weight when I moved them. It seemed like they were filled with feathers from angels' wings. It was glorious. 





Then I made the next move. I sat up for a better vantage point and to be able to use both hands. I sat beside her and she softly moaned when I touched her. Her breathing started to get slightly deeper. I instantly knew this was an experience in which we both felt a great internal release that had been building over the years as illicit sexual tension. I caressed her breasts and moved to her torso. Gently rubbing her stomach and chest and encircling her breasts from nipple to side boob.  I enjoyed every portion of them.  Then I slowly lowered myself to kiss her body. I started around her neck and slowly moved down her décolletage.





I moved over her body cautiously -- giving her ample time to stop me at any point along the way.  I softly kissed my way back up from her stomach to her neck and lingered near her ear before slowly approaching her face. I asked her if this was ok and she responded, ""yes, but don't kiss me on the lips. Those are the only parts off limits."" -- A sure fire defense mechanism, a-la the movie Pretty Woman. 




I longed to kiss her lips but totally respected her boundary. So, I worked my way south, pausing again to admire and spend time on her fantastic boobs. I kissed them, nibbled her nipples and gently sucked on different sections with my mouth. When I got close to her navel, I rubbed my hands on her stomach and down the outside of her thighs, returning upwards and teasing her on her inner thighs. I reached for her panties and slowly slid them down.  I could feel their wetness on my wrists as I took them off, which excited me even more.  I could hardly contain the excitement within me but was sure to go slow and enjoy each moment of a scenario that may never have the chance to play out again.





I lowered my lips to the mound between her legs and softly kissed her there. I breathed warmly as I passed over her clit and vulva, passing them by in absolute torture. I kissed her thighs, spread her legs apart with both hands, and lowered myself into position.  There I lay, rubbing her stomach, caressing her legs, softly kissing everywhere but THERE and gently breathing on her to silently announce I had arrived. She was moaning slightly and gently writhing. I descended my mouth to her clit and slipped out my tongue and took it into my mouth and ever so slightly sucked it and licked it. It was smooth and firm, erect with a tiny salute to pleasure. 





The sensation was surreal -- unlike anything I had ever felt on my mouth and uniquely distinct even to this day.  It didn't smell like mine but it was still 100% womanly. I was intrigued and my interest piqued even more. I moved my tongue around further and explored each fold and each lip. Her wetness mixed in my mouth. Even the juices were silky and I loved the taste of her.  I kissed and licked and nipped and then set in for a rhythm. I applied pressure to all the places I personally liked and consistently licked up and down.  I went faster and faster as her moaning increased and her breathing changed to a pant.  I alternated from time to time between a wide, flat tongue and a stiff flicker.  Then she started to cum. Her legs started to tense and she started to flinch and twitch. I burrowed in while her thighs pressed against my ears then she tightened and shook and relaxed all at once in an exhausted release.





I sat beside her lightly caressing her body and then asked her if that was ok...if she liked that. She said, ""yes, absolutely"" and that she was ""insanely tired from it all.""  It was probably 3 am and we both had to work early in the morning.  I pulled myself back up to my pillow and laid beside her and we both drifted off to sleep. 





The next morning and following days were normal just like every other day had been.  Almost as if it didn't happen. She started to get a little moody and I was getting busier at work and we suffered less time able to spend together after work.  After a few days, her moodiness turned to attitude turned to - what felt like - her pushing me away. Perhaps she was scared. Perhaps she regretted it. Perhaps we crossed a line in our friendship that it couldn't handle and we could never go back. Quickly, it became uncomfortable heightened by the insecurity questioning if it was because of the tryst...



I made the decision that our friendship was suffering and told her I had made the decision to go back to New York.  She responded with more attitude and pulled away, giving me what felt like the silent treatment in some sort of punishment: maybe for what I had initiated or maybe because I was leaving. I couldn't tell and we weren't talking about it.  I recall the day I left. She was cold and distant but hiding a pain underneath. I asked her if she was upset at me over what had happened. She said, ""no."" But added that when I get back to New York, ""don't expect our friendship to remain."" But we left it at that. I boarded the plane and we fell out of communication the rest of that summer. Perhaps she felt abandoned; perhaps I felt rejected.

Sort of an [UPDATE].,88,12,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/t0hfn/found_and_hooked_up_with_a_guy_last_night_sort_of/,"Hey everyone, just wanted to tell my story from last night and how I ended up sleeping over at his place last night. This is sort of an update from 2 months ago when I said [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/px71x/the_fluidity_of_sexuality/c3tbeuo). I forgot my password for that account so I made a new one.

 ANYWAY TO THE STORY:

Made an OKCupid account shortly after my girlfriend broke up with me, entered into it with a large amount of skepticism, but alas a good looking guy messaged me up (we'll call him Joseph) and suggested we meet up sometime for ""coffee or lunch."" Both of us being busy college students it was a few weeks before we really communicated after that, but last night I mentioned that I was going to a local bar to do some open mic and coincidentally he was going to the same bar for his friend of a friends 21st.

After having my fair share of drinks and playing some percussion on stage for a while he showed up and BOOM insta-connection. Now, I'm 6'4"" and skinny, I was completely blown away by Joseph, there he is, a few inches taller than me, Italian-looking and muscular. So we hit it off, turns out we have a lot of the same interests and commonalities. After a while we go outside the bar for some quiet and fresh air and we just start making out in front of the bar! That was a lot of fun and pretty earth-shattering for me as this was what I consider to be my first time (I've been with a guy before, but I was much too intoxicated to have it matter to me).Later we got to his place and I slept over!! =] We messed around quite a bit, but I was mostly content with cuddling. =P 
I didn't realize it until last night, but the fact alone that he is actually bigger than me is *really* amazing, because I love being ""the little spoon"" and finding someone who can really put their arms around me was pure ecstasy.   

I've been in man-la-la land all day.

I have always identified as a straight male. From my earliest days on the playground all the way through high school and into university, I had crushes, sexual experiences, and relationships exclusively with girls. Never did a guy ever turn me on.

At university I met a guy, Theo, in class, and we became fast friends. He is a small dude, and presents fairly androgynous. He's a beautiful guy. He's gay, out-and-proud, and it didn't take long for us to become best friends. A couple years passed, and I got the sense that he had developed a crush on me. Sure enough, we sat down one day right before the beginning of our university's summer break and he admitted to me nervously that he had indeed developed feelings for me. His biggest fear, though, was not that I would turn him down -- he expected that -- it was that our friendship would be irreversibly damaged. 

I assured him that although I didn't share his interest, he didn't have to fear losing our friendship. He was relieved, and everything went back to normal.

Almost.

I'll sound like a cad, but it's easiest to lead in to it this way: there's an age-old debate between guys, and everyone's supposed to fall into one of two camps: boobs or butt. I can lust over both, but what really turns me on is the stomach and torso. I don't know what it is about a fit core, but it gets me going. Now, Theo's got a hell of a body, and fits just about every point on my ""type,"" with the exception of his gender. Smart, funny, cute, conscientious, trustworthy, good conversation, a great listener, the list goes on.

That summer was spent doing a lot of thinking. It was a long summer. Introspection took up the majority of my time and it was exhausting. Eventually, I decided that if I denied his feelings for me (and my now growing feelings for him) for the sole reason that he's got a penis, I would regret it somewhere down the road. It just didn't feel honest of me.

Once university started up again, it was my turn to sit Theo down for another conversation. I basically told him that I was up for trying if he was still interested. He was. We did. And it worked.

We're together now. So far, he's the only guy that I've found sexually or romantically attractive. I guess that makes me bisexual. My question for you all is this: Do any of you have one or just a couple ""exceptions""? I know labeling is stupid and arbitrary, but is bisexuality the place for me? Also I guess I can answer questions you may have of me.

I've been tucking this away in some corner of my brain for some time.  I saved pictures of MtF pre-ops having sex with other women and with men; sometimes I'd imagine I was the man, but I especially enjoyed fantasizing myself as the woman.  I'd watch trans porn, bi porn, and even gay porn and become very aroused, but ultimately I would still tell myself I was straight.  

Rewind back a couple weeks ago, I started the /r/NoFap/ challenge, and I quickly realized a few days into it that fapping was putting my brain into a fog for the past 10-15 years. I've felt more alive in the past two weeks than in the past ten years.  

Last night, I was having trouble with self-discipline, and started to look to see if there were any physical barriers to prevent my temptation to fap.  While researching this, I found chaste devices which were typically used in BSDM circles.  So it eventually led me to come across a ""light BSDM"" discussion involving dom women and sub men. It was an inviting discussion and I've always had a thing for aggressive women, so I started to participate in the chat and playing along.  

I was really getting into it when she stunned me with a question: would I let another male sub have sex with me and give him oral sex?  At first I felt kind of strange, but rather than being turned off, the idea intrigued me.  I admitted that I'm not really all that attracted to men, but I didn't want to disappoint her.  I've been in a Buddhist/animist mindset lately.  I realized it's just a  body part from another subby/femmy *human being*, so why get so hung up on it?  

She was so good at this, and I wanted to please her, so sure, let's do this.  The moment I thought that, I instantly became aroused at the thought of giving pleasure to another man's penis.  I then thought ""would I really do this if I were in this woman's home/dungeon/etc and she asked me to?  My subconscious screamed back at me ""hell yes I would really go through with it"".

We played this out for a while, and I was absolutely having a blast.  It felt like ages since I had my mind blown with what we were playing out.  Then she turned up the heat.

I think maybe she noticed I was ""playing it safe"" by justifying all of my behaviors as straight since I and her other male sub were playing feminine roles.  She asked if I'd have sex with one of her *manly* men to arouse her.  I felt a repeat of my emotions before, and once again, I found myself to be very intrigued rather than repulsed.  

But this time, I thought about it a little more in my head, once again playing out this fantasy as if we were really doing it.  I was doing all of this only to please my female dom.  But guys are humans who need love too.  I thought ""what's so bad about giving physical pleasure to men?"".  Honestly, what was my holdup?  Some stupid arbitrary rules dictated by society?  

It was at this moment a breakthrough occurred, a lightbulb came on, a door flung wide open in my neural pathways.  I realized that not only would I pleasure this *manly* man in order to arouse and please my dom, but I would do it to arouse and please this guy, this fellow human being as well.  Suddenly, I had faced the fact that I'm not straight.  And I immediately realized I'd been ignoring this truth for a decade.  

*Holy crap, I think I'm bi.*  

And then there was a tidal wave of emotions, all positive.  I took a huge gasp and my eyes started to water with... what was this, tears of joy?  A huge wave of relief rushed over me.  It's like I had some part of my brain *that already knew this* all caged up for a very long time and I had just finally let it out, and that part was thanking me with a flood of emotions for finally being liberated.  I'm tearing up and getting choked up again just writing this.

Since I finally let myself be who I really am, now I'm thinking about all the new possibilities that are open to me, I might even be a little genderqueer.  But now I'm absolutely certain that I am sexually attracted to men as well as women.  

I have no idea what I'm going to do next, but I have a lot of reading to do now.  I come from a hippy family, so I've always been supportive of LGBT people, but now I feel I must dig deeper and learn much more about a new part of my life.   I think 2013 is going to be an interesting year.

There is no question that I'm also turned on by women and that I am much more emotionally attracted to women than men.  I noticed that I would get turned on by gay porn, but I never really notice guys in public or anything.  I have a very masculine ""straight guy"" personality but there is no doubt that I'm at the very least bicurious.

This past week I've had my place to myself and I decided to make a craigslist ad for casual gay sex.  Regardless of which gender, I am ""versatile"" and enjoy receiving anal sex, and I found a guy in my area who wanted to come over.  When he got here, he was a relatively attractive, slightly stalky hispanic guy and we got right to it.  Even though his face was decent I really disliked kissing him, as I've never felt much of a desire to kiss a man.  When I went down I was amazed to see that his dick was mammoth sized (he claimed it was 9"").  

Once we got to it, he got behind me and gave me the best anal pleasure I've ever had until he came.  This was probably only attainable because I have a tendency to play with big toys (he was surprised I could take it)

As soon as we both finished was the only unpleasant thing.  He just kind of got his clothes on and got out which was all I wanted him to do.

It's weird, if he was a woman I had just had sex with I would have wanted her to stay and cuddle and watch tv, but I really wanted him to leave and never acknowledge me again until next time I want more.

I guess this further reinforces my suspicion that I'm bisexual, but heteroromantic.

For at least ten years now I have known that I had a sexual attraction to guys.  I have no real interest in a relationship with a guy, but sometimes I really crave cock.  Over the past two years or so, I finally started to act on some of these impulses and explore that side of my sexuality.  (I have given and received oral with guys a few times)  But my oldest fantasy was to have a threesome with an open-minded couple, and let the man take my virginity while the woman watched and guided us.


Last night I finally went through with it, and it was amazing!  This married couple found me on swinglifestyle.com and contacted me last week.  We spent several days chatting and texting while we all felt each other out, and they were comfortable enough to invite me to their home last night.  I won't go into all the details unless that sort of thing is requested, but I can say that the entire experience really exceeded my expectations.  They were both very kind, very patient and very generous.  We completely shared ourselves with each other, and after an incredible two hours we were all thoroughly satisfied.

I am so glad that I waited until I found the right people to be with, and I am so glad that I acted on this fantasy.  They have already invited me back to join them again, and I believe this is the start of a long and really fucking enjoyable relationship!

I have supported them as an ally (before I came out) and support them 100% now from within the community now that I am out as a bisexual.  However, I am also kinky and also non-monogamous.  I get that all bisexuals are not non-monogamous and I am the first to speak up whenever I see someone prompting that misconception.  All I ask is that others are respectful of the fact that I choose non-monogamy because it works for me as an individual.  Some monosexuals too are non-monogamous.  Its a personal life choice and everyone should be free to engage in sex in relationships the way they want to.

However, I see in the queer community that there is often a lot of animosity towards non-monogamy and it makes me really sad and insecure sometimes within my own community.  On /r/actuallesbians right now there is a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1ar92i/question_for_you_ladies_about_sexy_times/) about what you do about strap ons when you have a new partner (buy a new one versus clean the old one when you switch partners but keep using it).  Being a collector of sex toys and being educated about them I know full well that non-porous materials such as glass, silicone and stainless steel are fully sterilizable so I use my toys with multiple partners just by sterilizing them in between.

If others want to buy new toys that's fine and really what bothered me was that some of the posts held the assumption that if you weren't buying a new toy each time that was wrong and if you couldn't afford to do that you were having too many partners.

&gt;I say if you're sleeping with enough girls to not be able to afford a strap-on for each then you're probably sleeping with too many girls at once.

Are we really going to have this sex-negative slut shaming from WITHIN the LGBT community?  We're supposed to be better then this.  I'm especially sad to see this from a group of people who is generally so supportive of queer sexuality and feminist thinking (sex-positivity was born out of the 3rd wave feminist movement).  

I just don't see how queer individuals can request and want there to be straight allies to the community and to want support for their lifestyles but then turn around and be so bigoted towards alternative sexual lifestyles.  I will support the individual right for someone to choose monogamy to the end but I do ask that others support my right to choose consensual non-monogamy.  

The non-monogamous/polyamorous community needs allies too, you don't have to have any interest or desire to engage in non-monogamy but I ask that you be respectful of the fact that it works for some people.   In many ways the poly community today is a lot like the LGBT community was in the past before they achieved as much acceptance as they have today.  Recognize the fact that it was a journey to get to where we are today and be respectful of the fact that the poly community and the kink community is still working to get that acceptance.  These separate movements have more in common then they have not in common.

All oppression is connected, if you want your lifestyle to be respected then please do the same for other alternative lifestyles.  ",BIGOTRY,False,,t5_2qwnx,False,,bi,True,t3_1at3ov,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1at3ov/queer_sexuality_nonmonogamypolyamory_and_antipoly/,

As a sort of newbie bi girl, I did something completely uncharacteristic for me yesterday that had better-than-expected results. I mustered the courage to ask out a girl that I've been majorly crushing on for a while, even though I wasn't quite sure of her sexuality. As it turns out, she's bi, and she is interested! There is a complication, though, in that she's sort of dating someone, but she doesn't know if it's going anywhere and has been thinking about exploring other avenues. So we're going to see what happens over the summer, keep in touch, and hopefully I'll have a date come September when we return to campus. :-)

Even though it wasn't 100% the answer I was looking for, I feel fantastic. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I'm only now just coming to terms with my attraction to women and am finally acting on the way I feel. It's like I'm acknowledging a part of myself that I never knew existed, which is a great growing experience in itself.

Sorry to be all rambly, but I'm just really excited and wanted to share. And to offer this advice: just go for it! Even if the other person doesn't return the feelings, whether it's because they just don't feel the same or because they are of a different sexual orientation, if they are a halfway decent human being, they will respect you for being brave enough to ask them out.

I also want to share a little bit of *why* I feel the way I do... maybe someone else will have some advice or a similar story or something. Sorry in advance if this is long. :( 

I'm a bisexual female, and really have only recently realized this--within the past six months. I suppose that most of my life, really, I'd been repressing same-sex feelings, but since I had crushes on guys I assumed that I was normal, that all straight girls had the same sorts of feelings I did. In October of last year, things started changing for me. The more I read about the experiences of other on LGBTQetc oriented blogs, the more open I became to the idea that you can love anyone, regardless of their sex or gender. Around the same time, a good friend of mine started pursuing me pretty strongly, and I definitely responded to her. And even though I maintained that I was straight I was so attracted to her, and we ended up dating for a short time. That's when I realized I'm not straight, and that bisexual would probably fit me best as a label.

Since then I've found myself increasingly attracted to women, and to be honest I wish I could just be a lesbian instead of being bi. I don't want to have any sort of sexual attraction to men. Part of this might have to do with being sexually abused by my father as a child, and to be frank I've always had a big chip on my shoulder about guys--how unfair it was that guys were allowed to be slobs and girls always had to be dressed nicely, how guys were allowed to have multiple partners but girls had to be the picture of Christian purity, etc. (I know that's all based on a very simplistic and stereotyped and kind of untrue view of the world; it's just how I felt very commonly when I was younger. Almost like I was being ""cheated"" out of a good relationship.) And I've been trying so hard to repress my heterosexual side, so much so that I occasionally feel like a closeted straight person, hah. It's awful and I wish I could stop forcing myself to be one thing or the other, but I'm terrible at dealing with being in-between anything. Not committing to one gender is difficult for me, mostly because of this mindset I just can't seem to shake.

I think another thing that gets me is I'm unable to be a part of any local LGBT community, so women are even more offlimits for me. (Parents are super against anything gay, and I'm living with them while I attend uni.) It'd be great to be able to get some experience with women, and I feel like that would help me be able to ""cross over"" more, but right now I am so, so frustrated by not being able to rid myself of some residual attraction to men. When Cynthia Nixon's comments were getting such backlash all across r/lgbt, I found myself thinking that her comments mirrored my feelings so much, and that I wished I could do what she is doing--living as a lesbian. And if I lived in a different area, I would be. 

Hopefully someone else has had a similar experience or even just some words of wisdom would be nice. Sorry for the length :(

Looking for advice/insight as I'm sure other people might have had this happen.

Me and my boyfriend both identify as pansexual and for him in particular he feels gender has no say in his behavior. This results in him getting ID'd as gay on a regular basis. What bothers me is everyone assumes I'm his beard. For those who may haven't heard the term beard before a beard is a person whose sole purpose is to keep up the appearance of heterosexuality for their partner. Some do this knowing what they're getting into others do not. I've also heard it applied to the girlfriends of closeted guys.

I've had friends of friends meet him for the first time and they go out of their way to warn me about their perception of his sexuality to keep me from getting hurt. The one that bothered me the most is yesterday his boss has a chat with him basically letting him know he knows hes gay and invites him to go to the lgbt parties at a industry convention they are headed to. His boss has met me before...

To me this feels like bisexual invisibility at its finest nobody assumes we're a loving open couple who knows each other, there is always the assumption that something shady is going one or that my boy is in denial and needs to be ""shaved"".

TLDR : Everyone assumes my boyfriend is using me to pass as straight or that hes hunting for Narnia.

How have/would you handle this?

-EDIT-

To clarify normally I think it is hilarious(minus my frustration about bi invisibility) and am just looking for other peoples views. It's the fact that this time it was his boss and I worry about job complications that got me posting. The going to lgbqt party part isn't the issue other than the what if his boss has a thing for him part.

I have been trying to deny/fix/remove the 'gayness' in me that makes me bi since i was 15.   I grew up in a house that hated gay people.  My father beat a guy with a wrench cause the guy made a pass at him.  I grew up thinking having gay thoughts/feelings was wrong and found Christianity to try and fix my evil self.

Along the way I found a wonderful woman who I married and had 2 great kids with.  All the while, hiding myself and trying to repair myself.

About three months ago, I started to wake up and realize that I am not broke and it's who I am.  I finally worked up the courage to tell my wife.  I knew it would be upsetting, but I thought our love was strong enough and she would understand the pain I have been through.  I thought she would understand that a sexual preference doesn't change who I am.

I was wrong.  She doesn't understand how someone can be bisexual and thinks I just haven't admitted to being a homo yet.  I love her with everything in me.  I am so fucking regretful of the whole thing.  I wish I hadn't told her.  I wish i wasn't like this.  I wish we could just go back to being us again.  

I just told her last night, so I know this is all still new, but she has pulled away from me.  I told her I feel like she is treating me like I went out and cheated on her.  She said that If I had cheated, at least then she would understand.  The lie i held is killing her and our marriage.   I asked her to talk to someone.. friends or a counselor if she couldn't talk to me.  She said all they would do is tell her to leave me.

I don't know what I am expecting from you guys.. but I had to tell someone.  I have no one to talk to. 

tl;dr: I screwed up my marriage by finally telling my wife i was bi.. should have kept my mouth shut..",,False,,t5_2qwnx,False,,,True,t3_oxiur,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/oxiur/i_think_i_threw_my_marriage_away/,

So I signed up for OKCupid and PlentyOfFish to see what would happen.

At first, just lots and lots of guys. Which I didn't want, because I just left a relationship with an amazing guy of 3 years. I didn't need another man in my life. I finally needed to discover my sexuality, and embrace the part of myself that is also very attracted to women as well as men.

So I started talking to girls. I hate saying this, but I have to be attracted to someone to consider being intimate with them. I'm not saying I'm looking for the Heidi Klums of the world, but there are some girls that I am very physically attracted to, and some who I'm not. And I talked to a lot of girls who I just couldn't see in a sexual manner, even though they had great personalities. And to have a good sexual connection in a relationship has always been important to me.

And then she messaged me. She was cute as could possibly be, and was generally interested in getting to know me. And the more I talked to her, the more I wanted to get to know her, too.

And we haven't stopped talking. Movies, food, jobs, friends, music, memories, everything. And we finally admitted how interested we are in each other, and want to get rid of the ""virtual"" aspect of it and start seeing each other.

And I'm excited that I found a girl that I really 'click' with. And it seems like she feels the same way.

1334476979.0,68,self.bisexual,sal1l,[update] My girlfriend and I just had our first bisexual foursome. It was awesome.,78,10,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/sal1l/update_my_girlfriend_and_i_just_had_our_first/,"I originally [posted here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/r92xb/my_girlfriend_and_i_are_planning_a_bisexual/) about advice on planning our first bisexual foursome, and there were some asking for updates, so here I am to share.

After meeting the other couple a few times, and getting to know each other a bit we finally decided to invite them over for drinks tonight. We started the night by going out to eat. After dinner we came back to our place for drinks and games. We started the evening with something tame (apples to apples) and some booze. After we became a little more loose we brought out a [sexy game we found online](http://www.greatsexgames.com/tna.html). 

The game started slow by asking us about different sexual experiences we had and would like to have. After we went through all the survey and thought cards, and were able to open up to each other a bit more we finally made it to the action cards.

Since we were playing this game as a stripping game, it didn't take long for all of us to become completely nude. The action really started though when the other guy drew a card that asked him to go down on his girlfriend. As my girlfriend and I watched, we couldn't help ourselves and I decided to go down on her too. The girls' ecstasy became one, and they seemed to both be riding the same wave of pleasure ultimately culminating in their simultaneous orgasms.

Soon after this, the last card of the game was drawn. My girlfriend drew a card that allowed her to receive head from any player of her choice for 69 seconds. After encouragement from the guys, we got her to choose the other girl. This being her first experience with another girl, they ended up ignoring the timer, and continuing until she reached an earth shattering orgasm. They then switched out, and my girlfriend had her first experience going down on another girl. Everyone was in agreement that this was the hottest point of the night. My girlfriend seemed like a pro. She was using her mouth and hands in ways that surprised even her. Ultimately she was able to bring herself and the other girl to climax multiple times.

At this point we all agreed that we needed a break. We sat and chatted for a little bit, and talked about how hot everything had been. We also talked about how comfortable we were with each other and agreed that everything other than a full swap was fair game. At some point I got bored with the conversation and started eating my girlfriend out again. This apparently turned everyone on, because before long our friend was getting head from his girlfriend. My girlfriend and I paused to watch, and when they noticed the audience they had, they invited us over to help. When we crawled over there his girlfriend said ""let the bicurious fella' go first."" I then grabbed his eight inch dick, and started going to town. This being the first cock I ever sucked, I was surprised at how natural it seemed. I was making him moan while my girlfriend played with his balls, and his girlfriend sucked on his nipples. At some point my girlfriend had moved over and started giving her head while I was giving him head. Everyone was in pure bliss. At a moment when we both looked up we decided to switch out. I gave his girlfriend head while she sucked his dick. We then switched out once more until my girlfriend made his girlfriend cum yet again.

This time we took a longer break. Everyone decided to get something to drink and rest up for the final round. My girlfriend and I became impatient once again though and decided to just go ahead and start fucking. She was riding me hard when he walked back in the room and yelled for his girlfriend to come see this. They both came in and watched us fuck like rabbits. We told them they were welcome to join in if they wanted, and I pointed out that she has always wanted to be eaten out while she was being fucked. The other guy then obliged and started eating her out while she was riding me reverse cowgirl style. Every once in a while I would pull out and he would start sucking me off. God was it hot. His girlfriend couldn't stay out of it and started giving him head while this was going on. We continued like this until all parties were exhausted.

After all the fun had been had, we grabbed a snack and talked about how awesome our night had been. We agreed that we all felt very comfortable all night with each other and would look forward to doing this again. We set a date before heading off to bed.

So now here I am, my girlfriend passed out next to me, and the other couple in the guest room. I haven't been able to take mind yet off how hot this was, and the things I am looking forward to doing next time. My girlfriend and I talked a bit before she went to sleep, and we agreed that this ended up being a great decision for our relationship, and she too can't wait to do this again.

It's a response to people who claim that bisexuals are somehow reinforcing a gender binary, and oppressing people who identify as genderqueer or agender -- which is not a new idea, but seems to have resurfaced recently.

----

Hi, I'm genderqueer.  Or, possibly, agender--I don't really know for sure.   I
don't have a firm understanding of what gender really *is*.  I was assigned a
gender at birth, but I don't identify with it any more than I do the other
gender.  For sure I hate my gender *role*; if I'd known 15 years ago what I
know now, I would quite possibly have made the decision to transition and live
closer to the other gender role.  But at this point in my life, I choose not
to.

So with that in mind, I want to talk about bisexuals, and the fairly common
complaint that a particular meaning of the word ""bisexual"" is erasing people
like me--that is, people who don't identify at either end of the gender
binary.

I am bisexual.  What I mean by that is that I could, potentially, be attracted
to anyone.  Some people prefer to use ""pansexual"" to describe that.  Recently,
I've been hearing quite a lot that my identity is wrong; people tell me that I'm
not bi, but rather than I'm pan, and that calling myself ""bisexual"" is oppressing
people who don't identify with the traditional gender binary.

I find this discomfiting, because I identify strongly with the ""bisexual"" label,
while ""pansexual"" leaves me cold.  That's not to say that people who do identify
as pan are wrong either, only that I don't feel like the word describes me.

So why is ""bisexual"" problematic?  The common complaint seems to be that it
contains the word ""bi"", literally meaning ""two""; therefore it reinforces the
gender binary, excluding genderqueer people, or at best, it requires a scale of
""male"" to ""female"" that all people can be placed on, which still excludes
agendered people.

As far as that goes, I see two problems.

Firstly, words often change their meaning over time.  ""Bisexual"" might have been
coined in an era when we only had a gender binary, but as the concept of gender
expanded, so did the concept of bisexuality.  I, personally, do not know *anyone*
who uses ""bisexual"" to mean ""I am only attracted to people who are 100% male or
100% female""; which, of course, doesn't necessarily mean that such people don't
exist, simply that I don't think this is the usual definition of the word.  To
define a word based on its etymology is an [etymological fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymological_fallacy),
and ignores the *huge* changes which have taken place in discussion of sexuality
since the word first appeared.

Secondly, bisexuality is hardly the only orientation which could be accused of
reinforcing the gender binary; what about ""gay"" and ""lesbian""?.  

I mostly present as my AAB gender; maybe I have some mannerisms or dress habits
which aren't prescribed by that gender role, but in general a random person I
meet could probably identify me as belonging to a particular gender.  So let's
say I begin a relationship with someone who identifies as a gay person of that
same gender.  ""Gay"" usually means ""attracted to the same sex or gender""; so is
that person erasing *my* identity by continuing to identify as ""gay"", even
though they're not the same gender as me?  Should I constantly remind them of
that, until they agree to identify as pansexual instead, just because I told
them to?

I've never heard anyone, ever, argue that.

I'll admit that when I realised I was bisexual, I had no idea that pansexuality
was a thing.  Would I have chosen to identify as pan if I had?  Honestly, I
don't know.  What I do know is that bisexuality has a long history, and besides
the literal meaning, it has a political meaning.  To be bisexual means something
beyond a simple sexual orientation.  I identify with people who have come before
me who identify as bisexual, and with people here, now, who identify as bisexual.
I'm proudly bisexual; it's not just a word that describes who I fuck, it's part
of my identity.

Bisexuals already have to put up with criticisms that gay people don't: we can't
be faithful, or we're not really bi unless we have equal amounts of sex with
either gender, or we have ""passing privilege"" because we can date or get married
to the opposite sex, or even that bisexuality doesn't exist, and we're really
either straight or gay and just can't admit it.

And now it seems we have another criticism: that we're reinforcing the gender
binary and gay or lesbian people somehow aren't.

Frankly, I'm tired of that.  I *hate* enforced gender roles, and the concept of
the gender binary, and the idea that everyone has to pick a gender and stick
with it (or else come out as trans and stick with the other gender).  These
problems personally affect *me*; they stop me from being who I am.  Anyone who
knows me can attest that I'm all for tearing down our society and replacing it
with something that's friendly to queers, whether cishets like it or not.

But you know, I don't think calling myself a ""bisexual"" is preventing that from
happening.  I'm not the one oppressing you; I'm not the person who thinks your
gender identity don't real, and I'm not the person who's denying you your rights
because of your gender, or lack thereof.  

So stop telling me that my identity is wrong, and instead focus on the things
that are holding *all* of us back -- genderqueers, trans* people, gays and
lesbians, and anyone else who falls under the ""queer"" label.

I have no problem with polyamory but neither of us feel it is right for us.

When I was 20, I broke up with a boyfriend of a little over a year. I quickly found myself facing my first relationship with another woman (We'll call her V for the purposes of this story). We met at a party at a mutual friend's house, and I remember my heart racing when I first set eyes on V. I had experienced small crushes in the past but was able to brush them off as nothing-- I'm totally straight, right?! This crush, I could not brush off. V's a lesbian and turns out she had a crush on me too! :) Shortly after this we began hanging out, then dating with a little apprehension on my part. I felt it was a little too soon to start dating again, but I decided it would be ok as long as we took things slow. Now was as good a time as any, right? 

After we started dating, I decided I should tell my mom about V. She creeps on my facebook and I was sure she'd find out sooner or later-- better hear it from me than from the internet, I figured. I called her, nervous as hell and told her I was dating another girl. ""Oh,"" she said. ""Maybe you're just lonely."" I assured her I was not, but she did not seem very accepting of it. She didn't say anything mean; she's pretty open-minded about that sort of thing. She just did not seem to believe me. I was hurt, to say the least. V and I did not end up dating for very long, only a couple of months. Turns out after doing a long-distance relationship for so long, I was shitty at keeping up a relationship with someone closer. My mom and I did not speak about the subject for two years.

Yesterday, she broke the silence. Out of the blue, she asks, ""So, you and V, was that just a one-time thing?"" I told her that I did not have feelings for V anymore. I'm currently in a relationship with a fantastic man, but we are in a monogamous relationship and I don't want to screw things up with him, even if I have small crushes on other women.

This seems like an overarching lgbt issue, but while I'm not really active in either this subreddit or r/lgbt, I know there seems to be an awful lot of drama popping up on my front page from them, so I decided I'd rather have this conversation here.

First and foremost, if I offend anyone, that is completely not my intent and I apologize.  As stated in the title, I've been lucky enough to have always been accepted for who I am, and while I have close friends that are not as lucky, I am first-hand ignorant in terms of bashing in regards to sexual orientation.

I'm sure what I'm asking about is a larger psychological topic than anything, and I'm sure it's been discussed many times before.  That being said, I've never been a part of one of those conversations, so I apologize if this topic has been beaten into the ground.

 =====

I'm bothered by how some members of our community segregate themselves.  I'm bothered by how some members of our community never seem to venture out of their comfort zone of LGBT friend, and then complain that the world doesn't understand them.  I'm bothered how we rally around that ""love is love"" and ""marriage is marriage"" but give ourselves a logo, special clubs in schools and on campuses, and shout about being proud to be queer, as opposed to being proud to be human.

I'm worried that progress will never actually be made if we don't stop waving our banner and attempting to stick out as different than everyone else, and just act non-chalantly about how when one guy friend talks about sex problems with his girlfriend, it's normal for the other guy friend to talk about sex problems with his boyfriend.

 =====

I understand being more comfortable around people who have gone through the same thing as you.  But, why do I see so many posts in r/bisexual about ""how do I ask a girl out?""  It really shouldn't be any different than how your straight IRL best friend asked out someone they were interested in.  Why do we only think that other lgbt people are the only ones capable of helping us with our relationship problems?  If ""love is love"" then why don't we equate our own same sex relationships with heterosexual relationships?

 =====

When I was in college, and part of an LGBT group on campus, they wanted to sponsor a dance.  I thought this was a great idea.  I suggested that instead of making it ""GAY PRIDE DANCE"" with rainbows and purple everywhere, they theme it like any old dance.  Go with a Hawaiin theme for all I care.  Just put on a ""fun"" themed dance instead of a ""gay"" themed dance.  Then, when uneducated bigots show up and have a problem with same sex couples dancing together, they would be in the minority.  They would see that it's not actually the end of the world.  Maybe they'd learn that ""oh, this dance was put on by the LGBT group?  That's cool of them.""  Maybe we could teach people who are uneducated about LGBT persons that yes... as humans we are all just one in the same... we're just attracted to different people.

But it didn't happen that way.  They put on ""PROUD PROM.""  Everything was rainbows and purple and sparkles and every bad stereotype imaginable.  They didn't crown a king and queen, but a king and king AND a queen and queen (they alienated heterosexual couples.)  The only straight people that showed up were people who were already allies.  People who weren't affiliated with the LGBT community didn't go, because they didn't feel welcome.

And maybe that was the point.  Maybe they wanted straight people to feel unwelcome.  Maybe they wanted them to know what it felt like to be alienated based on sexual orientation -- but I really don't think that's the mentality any of us should have.  Yes, there are idiot school boards and principals out there that have banned same sex couples from attending high school proms.  But shouldn't we rise above that?  Proms are just proms.  They're not ""STRAIGHT PRIDE PROM""s.

 =====

I've never been bashed for my sexuality.  I always considered myself straight, even though I was also attracted to guys, because I wasn't ""romantically"" interested in them.  It wasn't until I was 19 and someone showed me the literal definition of bisexual that I realized I was bi and came out as such.  I'm engaged to a female, and am fortunate enough to be able to marry her this summer.

I'm bisexual.  I always have been, and I always will be.  But what does that mean, really?  It means I'm attracted to both men and women.  I'm not ashamed of it, but it's not really anything to be ""proud"" of.  I mean, it's not like I'm better than straight or gay people.  It's just the way I am.  Sexuality shouldn't be something to be ""proud"" of.  It's just that -- your sexuality.  No big deal.

I'm sure my vision of this is skewed because I haven't been bashed.  I haven't been bullied into a corner of a safe space surrounded by only LGBT community members.  *I don't know what that's like.*  But even for those of you have that have been tragically tormented, don't you think that it would do more good to go back out into society and act like your sexuality is meaningless?  The sooner we stop carrying a banner, the sooner we're just another person, who just happens to be attracted to guys, girls, or both.

I'm not trying to attack anyone.  Not trying to be hurtful in any way.  I'd appreciate any conversation to be done in a respectful tone.  I'm not looking to pick a fight -- merely trying to gain a different perspective on my opinion.

You guys absolutely have come to the right place for support, if not for all of the answers to your questions.

I did want to start a thread for anyone wanting to talk about other issues that pertain to being bisexual, especially those of community and/or society. I feel that bisexuals are often stereotyped by both ends of the spectrum. Many heterosexual people seem to think that we're just confused, where homosexuals sometimes think that we'll ditch a partner for a heterosexual relationship when it's convenient. Both often agree that bisexuals are ""greedy"". It's difficult for me because I want to feel part of the LGBTQ community.

I'm also upset at the oversexualization of bisexuals, as if we're purely sexual creatures who can't make up our minds about who we want to screw. Just like anyone else, we're attracted to certain types of people. It's a little more complicated for us, but it definitely doesn't mean that we're attracted to any person of any gender walking down the street. And everybody, I'm sure you've heard your fair share of threesome and kink comments when telling people you're bisexual. (Not to say that's not fun, of course. Just that it's not core to our sexuality.)

All of this treatment seems unfair to me, especially in a community that absolutely shouldn't be divided in any way. Responses I've gotten from gay friends when discussing this were, ""Oh, you poor little bisexual girl... Must be real rough for you."" Well, sometimes it is. True, we have the option of having a heteronormative relationship, but we don't see that as an ""option"". We love who we love, and that's about the end of it. It's difficult to wade through all of this without the support of either the straight community, or the gay community. I think that's a big reason why so many people end up here, either trying to shrug off labels that have been imposed on them, or trying to define ""what"" they are, because they feel confused or pressured to do so.

Anyway, I just wanted to get a discussion started. Please let me know what you think, and I apologize in advance if I've said anything to offend anyone. I'm a very loving person, and I care deeply about the LGBTQ community. Dialogue is good, regardless, so I do hope that this thread produces some of that.

**EDIT:** I just wanted to thank everyone who participated in this discussion. It was exactly what I was hoping for when I posted this. I feel like I've made a lot of new reddit friends since last night. This whole experience has been really positive for me, and I hope that you've gotten something out of it, too. I'd like for it to continue, but I wanted to put a ""thank you"" out there to everybody who responded. I think it's really great that we can find this level of understanding and support.

I can never tell if anyone is anything other than 100% straight unless they're completely obvious (ie: stereotypical flamboyant gay man/butch lesbian). It's weird because I have a A LOT of gay/bisexual/trans friends, but for some reason this skill never developed for me. 

Next issue: I am usually attracted to more typically feminine/straight girls. I have no idea how to gauge if they are receptive to a woman. I find myself quickly falling into the friend zone because I have no idea if they're attracted to me ""like that"" or whatever. (Note: I am not complaining about the friend zone here. I love making new friends and if someone isn't interested in me more than that, it's okay! I just don't know how to get past that stage of our friendship.)

Overall issue: How the hell do you pick up women? I DID have an OkCupid account and listed myself as bisexual. (It's since been deactivated.) I didn't get a ton of interest from other women. I think part of my issue is that I am used to being pursued instead of doing the pursuing. I have no idea how to do so. I'd prefer for it to be more equal in those terms overall, but I just... I'm lost.

I hope you guys can help. This is a very serious part of my sexuality I feel I've never been able to explore more than just random drunken hook-ups.

I work in a field where we are trained on the appropriate vernacular, ways to address, and general social interactions for individuals/couples outside of the ""traditional"" heterosexual setting by various LGBTQA groups to better serve this population. I was surprised to learn that some people, specifically gay men, hold a strong sense of resentment and sometimes even hate towards men that are bisexual. This is thought to stem from the ability to be more socially accepted as they can ""blend"" in as a heterosexual and dabble in homosexual tendencies as they please with less stigma than if they were solely homosexual.

I am bisexual myself and although I was aware of this phenomenon, I didn't really expect to encounter it.

Basically, I just had the worst sexual experience of my short sexual career. Before tonight, I had been with 2 guys and one girl, and tonight I was hoping to have a wonderful time with guy number 3. I had suspected he was gay since I met him, and tonight at the club we both got drunk and he invited me back to his room. I had never had a straight-up hook up before, so I thought why the hell not.  However, on the way back to campus he asked that I enter the dorm 5 minutes after him, so I started having misgivings about this whole thing (I assumed he was out).  

When we get to his flat, it becomes apparent he is much more drunk than I thought he was. I tell him that I do not top (I can't, at least with guys) and he tells me he has only bottomed. This apparently means that although he is perfectly capable of fucking a guy, he can't find an a-hole to save his life. I still like him, and prefer hand jobs and blow jobs anyway, so I ask if he would prefer that. I get a flat out no. I'm ok with that, I don't have to orgasm for a good time, but I do like things like kissing and caressing. None of that either! After he realises he's not going to get off from fucking me (he was mostly thrusting into the bed anyway), he demands that I fuck him. I tell him that I Can't (I REALLY don't like topping, and my dick gets soft right before entering a guy, so I am trying to subtly avoid a more embarrassing hook up). He then says ""If your going to be gay, then you have to do both.""

Hold the fuck up. You have never topped before, and you expect me to top, when I physically can't?  I have been with 2 guys and it's the same. And what about your obvious intimacy issues? WE ARE FUCKING IN THE DARK AND I I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH YOU.  I like receiving, I like hand jobs and oral, and I like intimacy. None of which I am getting here. And after making all these accommodations for him, he can't take the hint that there are THINGS THAT I DON""T LIKE TOO.  Basically, that killed my boner long before his ass did.

So I respond, ""does it make a difference if I'm bi?"" Which, after he realised that there was no way he was getting fucked tonight, he proceeded to instantly put his pants on, jump out of bed, and try to tell me to ""find myself"" and help me determine which sex I prefer (basically, everything that I had already been thinking about since I was 12). Given that he was drunk, he ended up talking in circles, ""You like to receive, so your gay, but you give it to girls, so you're straight...you just need to find yourself.""

Actually douche, I found myself when I was 17 and someone was kind enough to tell me that you don't have to be gay or straight. That you don't have to like everything they do in porno, and that you should respect your partner and make it work if you really care about them.

Leaving politely was difficult.

Anyway, I just really needed to put this down somewhere. It's my first experience with a member of the LGBT community who has flat out denied my sexual identity.

Eventually it got to the point where I was obsessing over her, she be in my dreams every night and I was falling into a slight depression. I'd already told my other best friend and he was incredibly understanding and supportive and encouraged me to try and get over her because he was worried about my health and mental well-being. So I decided to tell her, half hoping that she'd react negatively so I would be forced to get over her. I told her and she was understanding and supportive and realised that it was necessary for me to distance myself from her for awhile whilst I got over it. It took about a year but finally I was at the point where I still had a soft spot for her but generally was happy and over it.

What are your thoughts like? Do you have sex with men or just have attraction to them? Are you queer, heteronormative, or closeted? I understand stigma involved in the last representation, but I am leaving room for discussion.

---

**Here's a simple manifesto of my sexual preference:**

When it comes to romance and sexual relations, I always fall for women. However, I have been in some inviting and enticing threesomes with MMF and MFF. I like proximity to men in a less than sexual way, but sort of as a support network that often times develops deeper understandings of one another. 

On the other hand, being intimate with a woman and sharing my time with a special girl is really what I look for. It's been a while since I've developed a relationship and I always think about sharing my time with and loving a fine lady, but sometimes think the stigma of bisexuality tarnishes my chances with the occasional girl I really fall for. I would say I can develop feelings for men, but not much more of a sexual attraction than thinking, ""wow! he's hot."" With ladies, I really enjoy intimacy, exploring each others bodies, making them tasty breakfast foods, making them laugh, and generally sharing in knowledge and compassion. 

I suppose I am compassionate with anyone I feel connection to, but I always end up in relationships with women. Also, although I enjoy some queer culture (Bowie, RHPS, Van Sant), I prefer a more heteronormative lifestyle (with a bit of side company and some dom/sub). I respect and acknowledge many forms of sexuality, but don't particularly care to boast about my own, as I think it's a private matter; in other words, pride parades and gay clubs and LGBT communities sort of irk me. I'd rather live within the means I think are necessary, but more power to you if that's your schtick.

A person's biological sex, or gender identity, just doesn't matter to me.

As for physical traits that attract me... well - ALL of them! I especially love beards on men and underarm hair on girls. I love a hairy man chest, or a smooth man chest as much as I like a nice lady chest. Breasts are awesome! I love the curves of women and the angles of men. I like gapped teeth and straight teeth, and any color eyes. I love chubby men and women, and thin men and women. Pretty much anything natural is utterly beautiful to me. I find myself attracted to all types and genders and sizes and ages... It's people I love, and I love to love them. Haha - that sounds so cheeeeesy.

So... I just wanted to share. I'm happy because my sexual preference just got a helluva lot easier to explain. :) Before I had this really complicated ""I'm bisexual, but there are more than two genders and I like them all"" talk. ""I'm pansexual, which means that I am attracted to people of all races, sexes, creeds, et c."" is much easier to say!

It isn't the same ""You are built to have sex with that"" feeling that I have with men.

I'm going to try &amp; be as not share to much detail here, but I'm just so happy! :) We went back to his place which quickly escalated to making out then cuddling in bed. After much flirting and discussion I asked him to be my boyfriend to which he told me he only dates someone if they might be his last boyfriend which I'm completely fine with :)

More cuddling and talking lead us to the couch again where he gave me the most mind blowing earth shattering bj I've ever experienced!

Finally the night ended with us back at his place to play Super Smash Bros. Brawl before watching Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along-Blog since he's never seen it despite his love for Joss Whedon :) unfortunately I had work in the morning other wise I would of spent the night.

I have a very affectionate and sarcastic group of friends who are always joking around in a sexually charged manner. Like, one of my friends will come up to me and say, ""I want you!"" and grope me or something. It means nothing to them, but all it does is make me uncomfortable because I don't want people to find out about me quite yet and I don't necessarily know how to react in that situation.

I've never done anything sexual with a guy. I had been dating my last girlfriend for a while by the time I realized and admitted to myself that, yes, there was at least some small part of me that was attracted to other guys. I felt really close to her and in love and thought we would spend the rest of our lives together so I worked up the courage and told her... I did not get a good reaction at all. We didn't break up because of that exactly, but she sort of used it as a something to hold over me and treat me poorly for the rest of the relationship. It was like I had cheated on her with a guy or something.

Anyway, after having my heart ripped out by such a terrible reaction and eventual break up. I hadn't said a word about my bisexuality to anyone except my therapist, and even then only really once. The break up was about 3 years ago, and I've spent that time fantasizing a bit and trying to come up with some way to experiment without anyone finding out. In the last couple months I've pretty much come to the conclusion of ""fuck it, I'm going to do what I need to do, and if people find out, they find out."" I made an OKCupid account (that I'm still working on finishing lol) and thought about who I might feel comfortable coming out to.

That's where the [f]riend comes in. I actually had asked her out a while back and we went on a couple dates but we'd known each other pretty well before that so we pretty quickly decided we'd work better just staying friends. So anyway, we're very close and she's mentioned in passing that she's had some attraction to girls before, so she seemed like a good person to come out to. Man, was I right. We were having dinner together and after a couple beers I worked up the courage to spit it out, and you know what she says...? ""I had a feeling."" I was just like, BULLSHIT LOL! How could you know when I wasn't completely sure until pretty recently, but she swears she could tell, lol. Anyway we had a great talk and she was super supportive. I told her the story about my last gf and about my OKCupid account and everything. It felt so nice to be able to talk about it out loud and so casually with someone. She helped ease my worries about the reaction I might get from girls I date in the future, and she even mentioned (I think only half joking) about us having a 3-way with another guy, lol! I told her that sounded great!

I don't think I'm ready to come out to anyone else just yet, but I'm not really actively hiding anything anymore either. I even used my normal reddit account and not a throwaway!

Fuck it, whatever it is that i come up with now I’ll just go with it.

For the longest part of my life I lived like any other teenager guy.

Played the “popularity contest” for a couple years. Been with girls. Made fun of that one openly bi girl we had. Never even thought about the possibility of not being like everybody else. It was “weird”. I didn’t want to be weird. I wanted to be accepted. Just like most teenagers.

When i got into what americans would call High School i had a change of heart. Said to myself to screw that shitty popularity contest. I don’t give a shit what people my age think about me anymore.

That bi girl i mentioned earlier? We became kind of friends. (Middle and high schools are in the same school here.)

Talking to her also kinda opened my eyes. For the longest time i considered everybody who was not straight to be weird. It’s not my mums fault. She always raised me to be tolerant. It was school that turned me into an asshole.

Now i realized, LGBTs are just like everybody else. No reason to make fun of them.

Still, I didn’t even want to think about possibly being different from the norm myself. That’s how bad school fucked me up. Anyways.

A while ago a good friend of mine came out to me by accident. He posted a link to a project he was working on here on reddit and showed me. I noticed the username was different from what he usually posts under. Turns out i found his “real life” account. I discovered that he is bi. No big deal for me. We talked a bit about it and then went back to talking about games, as we do most the time.

One thing that caused for me though was that it forced me to really think about who I am.

It’s a question that we ask ourselves our whole lives, isn’t it? “Who am I?” Well I sure as hell don’t know yet, I’m only 18. Maybe I’ll never know. Who knows?

There is one thing I know for sure though.

Thinking about everything I realized one thing. Everytime I thought I might like another guy more than just as friends i started distancing myself from them.

Was it a conscious decision? I’m not sure. Maybe it was a mixture of conscious and subconscious.

After sitting in my room with the doors locked and music on full volume i eventually came to terms with the fact that I am actually attracted to guys. And girls. I cried for whatever reason.

And that ladies and gentlemen is how i realized for myself, after suppressing it for years, that I am actually bisexual.

And you know what? It’s awesome now that I’m cool with it! I get twice the enjoyment out of seeing an attractive couple make out! :D

I’m writing this unneccesarily long text for you guys because this is the only thing i have enough balls for.

The girl and me, we kinda drifted apart. Talked less. Other than her I know not a single person that isn’t straight. Well except for a cousin I’ve seen once in 18 years.

I don’t know who to tell, but I can’t keep it in anymore.

My mum always told me she would love me no matter what kind of person i might turn out to be. Still, I’m afraid of disappointing her in some way. My brother is way too immature. He wouldn’t understand. Other friends? I hardly have any. The few that I have I’m not sure of their opinion.

See, my family is not super religious. Nobody would try to send me to a “gay cure camp” or something like that. I’m just a chicken.

What I’m afraid of is losing the few people that really seem to care about me. I know some of you will probably laugh at that, considering what many of you have had to go through. I mean I actually have it pretty easy. Still.

Maybe I just need some friendly encouragement. But there is nobody I can get that from, really.

I don’t blame anyone for not actually reading all of this by the way. I mean it’s quite the wall of text. But to those few that do: Thank you.

Also: Thank you T. and A. for helping me come to terms with myself. If you happen to read this by chance you know who this is. You both know enough about me to recognize me.

Both of you are awesome. Trust me.

So are all of you here. Reading all those posts here gave me the balls to at least tell you guys.

Now that this is out of the way I feel like I'm one piece closer to figuring out the ever-growing puzzle that is myself.

1325716870.0,54,self.bisexual,o33p9,On the defense of monogamy in r/bisexual and why I disgaree,73,19,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/o33p9/on_the_defense_of_monogamy_in_rbisexual_and_why_i/,"I agree that as a community, we need to stand up against bisexual stereotypes, and one of the more damaging ones is that bisexuals are less capable of having a long-term monogamous relationship.

As we know, a bisexual man or woman can be just as sexually exclusive as someone who is straight, whether it is not acting on a desire for men when with a woman, or not acting on a thing for blondes when you are with a brunette. 

Where I differ with some here is in the defense of monogamy as the ideal in defending bisexuality. While I think that monogamy can be right for some to strive for or achieve, and believe that bisexuals can be just as good at it as straights; I think we should be honest in acknowledging  that humans are generally not so good at it as evidenced by divorce rates, cheating, and people living in passionless marriages.

I think that perhaps the reason that bi's get pegged as being less monogamous than straights is that on average, bisexuals are likely to have a more sex positive worldview and be more open to other forms of relationships rather than accepting monogamy as the default or only valid form of relationship. 

I lived in a monogamous marriage for 20 years and experienced first hand how defining a relationship first and foremost by sexual exclusivity led to a marriage that was successful by that standard while failing at openness, honesty, happiness, bitterness and resentment.  In my experience, it was only after developing a sex positive attitude, accepting my wants and desires, and fully opening up to my spouse did we come closer together than ever before and have what is a truly successful marriage; ironically as we dropped the requirement of sexual exclusiveness. Having sex with other people (together as a couple) made us happier, more fulfilled and brought us closer together. 

I am not saying to not be monogamous, I am advocating that you stop and consider why you want to be monogamous and make a decision to do so after considering the other options and accepting that while bisexuals are not any less capable of monogamy than straights, few of us are good at it given enough time.

tl;dr: my wife and I gave up monogamy as the defining ideal of our marriage, and are way better at marriage and closer than ever.

* Constantly wondering if that bartender/server is bi because they were a little bit too friendly, smiled a bit too long, and did they just wink at me?

* Labeling yourself as bi-curious because really, who the fuck knows who/what you are?

* Laughing at silly situations ""bi-curious"" people put themselves into.  Realize you were just as, or more, dumb in possibly similar ways.

We had met at a track meet a couple weeks before so we knew to look for each other. Yesterday when we met, he came up to me and gave me a hug. Then we sat down and cuddled for warmth (it was pretty cold). We sat like this for some time until he need to get ready for his event. So we walked over to the bathrooms and he went inside as I walked around the corner, seeing that it was kinda secluded. He opened the door to come out and I called him over. ""What's up?"" He asked. ""Oh nothin. Just hanging out behind this building, away from everyone."" ""Oh really?"" """"Really""

He grabbed my ass first as I slung my arms over his shoulders. Then in a sudden and probably expected move, he stuck his hand down my pants and started to stroke me. He could tell I was obviously prettypent up when he whispered in my ear, "" I'm going to blow you"".

He pulled my shorts down and, well, got down to it. He wasn't bad for his first ;) 

After that, more making out ensued and eventually I convinced myself it was my turn. Damn he was thick! Ill admit that im still a little sore haha.

I thought this would be a fun story to put up here. 

I am a 20 year old male living in Norway. I have lived most of my life in confusion and was never quite sure why I couldn't completely relate to my straight friends. People see me as a sweet guy who wouldn't hurt a fly.


I have a ton of wonderful female friends and love going out to drink tea with them and just talking. I do have some guy friends, but for some reason it was more fun to be around girls, and I didn't quite understand why my buddies and I weren't on the same page kinda. 

Looking back now I see that I've always fantasised about men, but I guess I was in denial of the part of my sexuality. I've had some GFs but it never quite worked out. 

Yesterday I decided that it was about time to come out. After some ""experiments"" and pondering, I had become sure that I was anything but straight. Even though I think sexuality is way too hard to label, I thought bisexuality suited me the best. 

So here goes, I posted on facebook, shaking because I had a lot of people I was afraid would react badly, like family and so on. 
I posted: For all those who are in doubt, I am as straight as a water-damaged plank. Oddly there were no reaction for about 5 minutes. 

Then a life-long friend replies: So you are bi/gay? 

I reply: Yes, I am. (Bi) :) No one else bothered to reply to the status so I asked her, it ain't a big deal for you? Because I was kinda confused since this was a really big step for me. The realization of being ""not-straight"" was huge for me. A relief. 

She replied casually: Everybody has known you were gay/bi for a long time. We didn't even know you were INSIDE of the closet.

I wouldn't just go around announcing if I was straight... 
If someone asked me, I would tell them the truth. And I talk about hot girls all day so some people are definitely suspicious. People have called me gay as a joke because I talk about hot girls so much and I just laugh it off because I don't really want to have the ""yes I'm bi, no it's not a phase"" talk. I'm 17f, and I guess it's hard for people to understand that I know myself better than they think.

BONUS QUESTION:
I also feel different things for guys and girls? I'm romantically attracted to both, meaning I could see myself in a relationship with a guy or a girl. I'm much more physically attracted to girls, meaning I think girls are just better looking than guys. BUT I'm much more *sexually* attracted to guys, meaning I imagine myself having sex with guys more than girls. Is this craziness normal? It's hard explaining it to people I talk to, and sometimes makes me feel that I'm not actually bi although I think girls are really sexy/hot....

So I've been working on the wiki for quite some time -- mainly through layout changes and gradual additions -- but I've figured out I need some help. And where else better to go than our community?

The wiki is currently up, but I need help adding some preliminary articles to get the ball rolling. So if you:

* Have some free time
* Enjoy writing
* Are passionate about bisexuality, omnisexuality, pansexuality, or anything in between

Go ahead and reply to this post and I'll send you a PM to the link of the wiki. Then we can get this thing up and functioning sooner rather than later!

Learned a lot about my sexuality.,60,7,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/yqdrd/went_out_with_another_dude_learned_a_lot_about_my/,"A few days ago, I made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/yepem/trying_to_figure_out_if_i_want_to_act_on_desires/). The support I got from y'all made me say, hey, let me take a next step in exploring my sexuality. I switched my online dating search from straight to bi seeking men. The first thing I noticed was that I got waaay more pageviews and more messages too . . . definitely flattering! I chatted with a nice guy for a bit and we arranged a date a few days later. 

My feelings as the date approached were a roller coaster. The guy was definitely attractive and interesting, albeit not too communicative, so there was little reason to be off-put there . . . part of me was like wow this is a big step, part of me was like man this is gonna be weird, and part of me was like what if I fall in love, also don't sleep with him on the first date, etc. etc. I definitely had some very blush-inducing thoughts about the prospect of gettin' it on at some point. 

Here's the part that surprised me--but maybe shouldn't have. We met up and I quickly realized that whatever chemistry was possible between us, I felt none of it and no desire to create it. It was like dinner with a friend. I don't think this was due to anything he or I did . . . the conversation was engaging, but I just didn't even try to push the tone towards a datey one. I went into that date feeling quite bi . . . I came out thinking I'd found the upper bound on my personal Kinsey scale. I'm certainly not a zero, but I'm nowhere near a 2 or 3. I didn't even feel a sexual attraction . . . despite all the hot fantasies I've had about men, when I was actually in the presence of another man with the potential to act on those fantasies, the desires were definitely absent. He was a nice, attractive guy who paid for dinner. He did it all right. I just wasn't into him.

In a way, this is consistent with my prior experience: despite plenty of fantasizing, I've never actually felt in-person attraction to another man. I feel like it resolves my worries about changing my sexual identity relatively late in the game . . . I'm definitely not as straight as your prototypical Ward Cleaver heterosexual, but I'm just as definitely not biromantic and seem to have no urging to engage in sex acts with other guys. I just like to fantasize about that. My next step: I've purchased some sex toys. Phallic ones. I'm hoping they'll allow me to act on my fantasies in a way that I actually enjoy . . . since realizing them with another guy, I learned, has no IRL appeal.",EXPERIENCE,False,,t5_2qwnx,False,,,True,t3_yqdrd,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/yqdrd/went_out_with_another_dude_learned_a_lot_about_my/,

I understand that it can help support the myth that we are sluts that want to have sex with everyone but since that's not the case, can't we just explain things to people instead of completely discouraging it in this community?

I know it isn't for everyone and I'm not saying that it should be. Some people are very happy in monogamous relationships and that is great! :) But also some people, and some who happen to be bi, are happy in polyamorous relationships. And that should be great too! So why is there this great divide? Shouldn't we support love in all of it's forms?

Disclaimer: I do not limit polyamorous to having sex with multiple people. Polyamorous can also be committed but non-sexual romantic relationships as well.

Also, if you feel inclined to judge me, thanks for keeping it to yourself instead of posting anything at all.

My story: XX year old white male about to get married to a woman again. I've been single-divorced for for about XX years and feel like I've found ""the one"" who meshes with me best. She's really awesome and I love her. She's sort of a unicorn - bi and comfortable with it - and she knows I am bi, too. Our sex life is pretty damned good, pretty much all of the time. We've agreed, more or less, that it's just us sexually from here on out. It feels right to make this commitment. 

What's the rub, right? Well, it seems the longer I am in a monogo-hetero relationship, the more I start craving man-love. Specifically, sucking cock. So, over the past year I've indulged a few times and sucked off guys when the opportunity popped up, so to speak. A couple of times I arranged this and another it just sort of happened spontaneously. I've struggled with this a bit, mainly because I haven't told her anything about it. It seems pretty innocuous to me, but I also know she may find it hard to cope with since all of our bi-times were supposed to be a thing of the past. She's given up girls and I was supposed to give up boys. 

Only thing is, it's not working like that for me. I want to suck cock and would love to bottom for the right dude. I like being with men and can't imagine saying it's over for ever. But, I also want to keep her in my life. I'm afraid of moving into a ""poly"" kind of position because I fear she'll reject that transition. Is anyone else out there living this kind of life?

",60,8,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/qq97m/why_do_i_see_so_many_people_identifying_as/,"This bothers me because it seems like a good sized contributor to bi-erasure. When I came out as bi I was in a long term relationship with a man (i'm female) and so I had questions and just wanted to be around women who were with women to feel like I wasn't alone. I joined a lot of forums- bisexual forums, lesbian forums, as well as general lgbt forums. One thing I noticed kept popping up over and over, especially in the lesbian forums, was that it seemed to be accepted that lesbians occasionally have sex with and are attracted to men. In one instance that I remember very clearly, a woman, who identified as a lesbian, was wondering if she may actually be bi because she was, for the first time, feeling a strong sexual attraction to a man. Two of the comments were ""it's okay to like a little dick now and then"" and ""just because you sleep with a man every once in a while doesn't mean you lose your lez cred"". 

The more I got into conversations about sexuality with my friends I found out that many people who identified as straight, both male and female, had fantasies about people of the same gender and some even had homosexual experiences but still identified as straight. Similarly my gay friends, male and female, had fantasies about people of the opposite sex, some even had heterosexual experiences,and still identified as homosexual. 

My husband, who is also bi, said that he experienced the same in gay male forums- that it was usually acceptable for a gay man to occasionally be attracted to women and have sex with them. 

If these people are actually attracted to and enjoy sex with both genders, wouldn't that just make them bisexual? And doesn't their denying it just contribute to bi-erasure?

I came out as bisexual to my mom when I was 15/16.  I'm 25 right now.  My mom is a catholic and prudish and has always been super-awkward about my sexuality.  I, on the other hand (and my friends), don't really care.  I'm bisexual, I'm cool with that, and it's just kinda...fuck the world if they think differently.

My mom recently remarried.  So, now I have a few stepsisters and a stepbrother, with one stepsister living with her.  Well, I just went out for drinks with that stepsister and we had a nice long chat about what we've been told about each other, among other things.  Because my mom likes to project the 'perfect family' image, I assumed that she never said a word about my sexuality.  I brought it up to the stepsister, who said she doesn't care (""My best friend's a lesbian..whatever"").  But then she said, ""When your mom was talking about she was like 'yeah, he says he's bisexual, but I'm pretty sure he's really gay,"" and then, ""I think he wanted to own a dog because he's never going to be able to have his own kids.""

Fuck. that. shit.  I'm so, so fucking irate.  I have it together enough not to wake her up and yell at her, but....barely.   My mom had also told me that my stepsister slaps her child.  She doesn't, acutally.  She gives him a small pop on the mouth or spanks him when he's acting up, but nothing abusive.  So, currently we have this weird agreement that neither of us is going to bring this up because my mom's a passive-agressive, Catholic-guilt-trip kind of woman.

But what the fuck?  She's telling people I'm secretly gay, like I'm halfway out of the closet.  I don't know what to do, if anything.  I have a job that takes me all over the country, so I spend time at home from time to time and, while I've been here a few weeks, I'm leaving in 4 days on another assignment.  Do I say something?  Let it be?  I'm so, so pissed right now (as is my stepsister, honestly).  I just don't know what good would come of us confronting her about it.

EDIT/UPDATE - After having our discussion (which you can see below), I went to my room to surf the net and continue on with my day.  After 10 minutes, she came in crying, apologizing, saying ""it's my own stupidity.  I shouldn't have said it.""  She admitted to not knowing much/anything about sexuality and I told her that she doesn't really need to, only that I know who I am and how I identify and be confident that I know what I'm doing.

1362934106.0,53,self.bisexual,1a11z0,17 year-old boy -- I think I'm bisexual ,60,7,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1a11z0/17_yearold_boy_i_think_im_bisexual/,"Hey everyone ! I'm basically pouring my heart out here, and it's really long but I want to feel like I'm part of a community, that there is someone out there listening. Read Please and Thank You all for giving people like me a sanctuary =) I've never told a single soul about any of this, so please be caring =)

My name is Ty, but you can call me Ageni because that's portion of my middle name that I like =) 

I'm a senior in high school, and I think I'm bisexual.

I really don't know where to start. So I guess I'll start with me over the years. Up until a few months ago, I would've considered myself a perfectly straight boy. For the longest time, I've loved things that boys love - sports, video-games, nice cars ... girls. 

And I still like sports like football, which I had played sophomore year(running back), and I would love to drive a Subaru WRX STi with Ken Block. I am still attracted to girls, both physically and emotionally. Please keep this in mind as you read, because I will seldom mention them in this. 

But as I've grown up, I've developed this keen love for different types of art and literature. I LOVE films to death, I love writing(I am an editor for my newspaper), I love ""Edgy Teen Stories""(as B&amp;N would say) that make me emotional and cry -- but also a lot of things that straight boys usually wouldn't be in to. 

For example, I love super-good looking male models(especially actors), and I really like the whole concept of modeling as a whole, and that is really important to my self-discovery. I have probably hundreds of pictures on my iPad of male models that I love to just look at. And the range of modeling is quite wide. Like sometimes I like stuff like Burberry, and others like GQ. I love the artsy stuff - but it really just depends on the guy I'm looking at. I'm not into modeling that emphasizes like abs or being ripped, so I'm not into Channing Tatum, who is a rather handsome man that I would nevertheless NEVER kiss. That type of modeling is stupid to me.

 I love things that deal with the complexity of the face, and body shape. Like for example, I have so many pictures of Robert Pattinson because he's perfect in that respect!(Sorry if I'm random =/  ) But there is a similarity between the boy and guy models I choose. Most of them are androgynous, my main attraction, and most of them I would do near anything with.. This desire seemed to just come out of nowhere, but its definitely here.(It hit me around 16 or so when I saw a picture of a younger Leonardo DiCaprio, who is certainly on that list of boys, and felt some weird unknown physical attraction to it.) 

Anyway, my attraction has been strictly photos up until my junior year at my high school. There was this sophomore who you could tell by the way he dressed, walked, and talked, that he was certainly gay. But very introvertive  about it because my school is very homophobic, and I've been hearing that school kids bully him about it. 

But this boy, is BEAUTIFUL ! 

He is very androgynous, with super dark hair that he wears in a variety of model-like styles. He's like 5'9, around my height, and from what I can tell he's on the skinnier side, but probably not bone skinny. He wears super stylish clothes that I love, and I'm sorry his eyes are so deep and black that the few times we talked, I couldn't even look into them cause my heart was POUNDING! Its weird because in the right light his skin will look light tan/bronze, and sometimes he will look kind of pale. But he always looks so beautiful. When I'm around him, I just feel nervous and I get the butterflies like crazy. I would do ANYTHING in the world to kiss him -- but I can't because I'm overly-shy, and I feel that if I tell him I'm bisexual it would feel weird because I'm a year older than him.. And before you guys suggest this, I physically could not tell him out of the blue that I'm bi . It would have to be during like deep conversation or something. I am trying to think of ways I could spur that with him, though.

Anyway, he is not the only boy. There are others who I am certainly physically attracted to, but he is sort of the apex of attraction for me. Having to go to school with him has really made me question my sexuality. The thing is, I am still attracted to girls -- many more than boys -- but the boys I am attracted to are like irresistible magnets. There are some boys I would choose even over the prettiest girls. And not just in a physical sense. 

When I look at who I am, and who I want to be, lots of times I can just feel in my heart that the right boy would be better than anything. And that's the thing. I want to be bisexual. I want to meet up with other bisexuals/homosexuals and share my experiences and make friends. I want to kiss my biggest boy crush on earth. I want to get in bed with him. Most importantly, I want to hug him and tell him to ignore all the people that make fun of him for being himself. I'm sorry, typing this is  getting me into tears because this part of me wants all of these things so bad it almost hurts, because at the same time I feel there is some remnant part of me that is scared, and repulsive towards all of these things. 
I'll up late in my bed, thinking about my crush or some boy, and I would pause a second and think something like:
""Why are you so fucking weird?""
""Are you seriously a faggot?"" 

I know, I know, this sounds like a movie or something, but seriously it's like another part of me that would love to push away all of my new desires. I feel it now, as I'm typing this in my room, and it almost makes me want to think that all of my desire is fake. A phase that will pass. But nothing in the world would hurt more. I love my new desires, I love loving boys, I love being able to see the beauty in the shape of a girl, and a boy. I really have never loved anything more than this new ""me"". If I wake up someday and I'm back to the same old me who would hate all of these new things I'm into. It feels right. It feels great, like I've woken up for the first time. In fact everyday, I go to my crush's Facebook and look at pictures of him or any other attractive body for that matter, just to re-affirm to myself that I am indeed attracted to them. If this ever went away, I'm not going to lie I would probably consider suicide. 

Like I said before, I like girls, and the percentage of girls I would be intimate with per girls I meet is far greater than that of boys. But I am still attracted to some boys, nevertheless. 

And that is another thing. Sometimes I feel like I am lying to myself because I am attracted to androgynous types. But the thing is I am still fully aware that they are boys, and that is what really sparks the flare in me(or, you know what I mean). And it goes the same way around, I am deeply attracted to girls that have distinct boy features. I don't know if bisexual is the term to use for me, because only a slim amount of the boys out there are androgynous. But I would do everything with them that I would do with a girl. Emotionally, however, I would much rather involve myself emotionally with a boy. 

Am I bisexual, or am I just a straight guy who is kinda weird?
I want the former to be true, but I want you guys to decide. 

As of now, I've never had any serious girlfriends, mostly because I rarely go out to party/rave. I am usually at home reading a book for hours, or watching a film -- writing or doing something that sparks my interest. I've been asked out plenty times, and my football guys are always weirded out that I don't have one because I guess they consider me a handsome guy(I hate complimenting myself about anything). 

I have never done anything with a boy, though I really like being around gays/homosexuals because I feel an aura of honesty with them that I usually don't with heterosexuals. And they're just funny and fun to be around. I would love to do something with a boy, however. 

Anyway, I think I've gone long enough here. So Sorry if you're sick of reading this and wanting it to end!! Really sorry for typos if there are any!
Please tell me what you guys think about me! Anything! I'll be checking this post periodically over the day and I aspire to become a member of this community! This is my first step.

Thanks =)

I wouldn't say I'm ""feminine"" , but I've never had a problem with women painting my finger/toe nails or doing my hair (its a bit long n curly), and I do have a nose stud..so I don't think many people will actually be surprised when I come out. However, I've always kind of been the ""player"" in my groups and felt like I was letting my boys down when I would actually find other guys attractive (thus I never spoke about it).  Fast forward some time (I had a daughter and moved to another state) and I'm in a city with a rather pronounced gay area and it helped me feel more at ease about these thoughts. 

Through my sexual journeys, I eventually came to discover the magical world of anal pleasure (HOLY SHIT!) which I guess pushed me over the hump in accepting being with another guy. About a month ago I was involved in a 3way with a couple (guy/girl) and found myself actually more turned on by the guy. As such, I've accepted that there's nothing wrong with wanting to be with either sex and I've never felt more liberated internally in my life. 

I come from a very liberal state and family and we all are very pro-gay rights/marriage so I'm not overly worried about coming out to my mother. I live with my brother currently and want to tell him but am a bit worried he'll look at me differently afterwards. My real concern is my daughter (whose 7)...If you have children, how did you deal with it? And my other question is: There's this guy who I'm very attracted to that works at a store I frequent every day and he SEEMS like he could be gay/bi (he wears a hint of guyliner) and I'm completely clueless as to how to hint that I'm interested?? With women I have no problem, but I've never flirted with a guy before...Any tips??

Lastly, if you've read this far, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart. I feel even better just writing this out and all comments are GREATLY appreciated! Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend! :)

This being the principle place I come for sexuality talk, I'd really like some external points of view and ideas because I really feel like shit atm.

I'm a bloke, 24, and I've been aware I've been attracted to guys for about 10 years now. I finally got the opportunity to be with a guy sexually the other day, a long time coming, and it was terrible. 

For a bit of context, I've always had a bit of an iffy libido. Sex is only appealing to me when I'm horny and in the past even when I'm having sex with a girl, I find myself wishing I wasn't horny so I didn't have to do this. Nevertheless there are a lot of people that have and can make me feel giddy and sexual and whatnot--I'm very prone to crushes--disappointment has been something I have a history with.

So I'm with this guy and things are going swimmingly, I really fancy him, there's the giddy feeling, I feel lovely making out and being handsy. It was kinda determined ahead of time that I'd be receiving, that's what I wanted because it's what I hadn't yet had with girls.

The moment comes and I can feel virtually nothing. I feel full is about the extent of it. The momentum of the night comes to a thundering halt. Even with a decent vibrator on hand I get nothing out of a prostate massage. We had to stop and because I was still pent up and needed to orgasm I had to put on straight porn to get me there. It was humiliating.

I haven't heard from the guy in the days since and I can hardly blame him. That's fine I don't really care but the whole situation has been swirling around in my head since. I imagine that if I bothered to continue with gay relationships, I'm going to have no sex life and it seems too much to ask of everyone I go out with to be virtually chaste. I could only have passive partners like with girls but that doesn't work for me with guys, guys bring the passive out of me. 

I actually feel less attracted to guys and for the first time in ages, I don't like that I'm bi when that has been something I took value in about myself. It feels like maybe being attracted to guys is now just a burden or handicap that I'm going to have to be frustrated by forever. 

I feel humiliated but I'm not one to be rash so I really want some other voices in my giving some contrasting views on how I should feel and what maybe I should do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh and there's another issue, my friends have noticed something is wrong. I've been out to these guys for ages and they've been supportive of my dating guys and whatnot. I'm sure they think I had my first sex with a guy ages ago and I've been happy. I don't know how to explain to guys who are straight friends what's going on in my bi brain right now. It's not exactly easy when things are going well.

I can tell you it's been some fucking valentines day for me.

Advice?,52,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/13iqg5/i_think_my_girlfriend_is_bi_and_i_want_to_be/,"Ok I can go into more detail if need be but I'll mention some of the things that lead me to believe she is bisexual:

* Stares at attractive women when we are out 
* Gets off(extremely) on threesome porn especially when it begins to focus on the female on female play (we watch together sometimes)
* Has told me stories of how she used to play with herself when she was younger to girls in bikinis 
* Once I asked her very casually if she had an interest in girls too and she said no right away. I dropped the subject but then a week later she approached me and wanted to be held and cried a little told me she just wanted to let me know she doesn't think she is but she has some 'weird' feelings about it. I told her not to worry and not stress about it right now and she could always talk to me whenever she wants.

I am asking for advice today because recently she has told me about a girl in one of her classes that playfully spanked her butt. The convo turned into her wondering if the girl was bi or a lesbian or what not. She has brought up this girl by saying ""You remember that girl that I told you spanked my butt? [new thing about her]"" about 3 more times and its only been 2 weeks. We have been together about 4 and half years now so I know her pretty well and I can tell something has sparked her interest here. 

What should I do? I know she can be emotional about the subject so I don't want to ask again just out of the blue or anything like that. Should I continue to just let it be? The last time I have mentioned anything was about six months ago. 

Also for what it is worth I am not rock solid on the whole monogamy thing under the specific situation where one of us was bisexual.

I'm bi, and in a hetero relationship.  I pass, and I'm in the closet--but I'm sure the folks closest to me know the truth.

Following the FRC shooting, the great blogger [Joe Jervis](http://www.joemygod.blogspot.com) was getting loads of anti-LGBT tweets, while he was attempting to defuse some crazy inflammatory tweets by conservative talk show host Dana Loesch.  Then someone responded with the following: [""Blocked because you're an annoying #queer #fuckwit. Log off and finish your quilt.""](https://twitter.com/JoeMyGod/status/235898883392290816)

""Log off and **finish your quilt.**""  Like...the AIDS quilt.  

Whether they meant, ""Get AIDS and die,"" or just, ""It must be lonely without all your dead friends,"" I was just absolutely shaken.  I sat there, literally trembling.  The vitriol the LGBT community is subjected to, the politics, the discrimination, the constant belief that we aren't just second-class citizens--but that the world would be better off if we were dead, is something I can't wrap my head around.  And then I realized how uncomfortable I was saying, ""we.""

I wasn't at Stonewall.  I haven't had to fight laws that deny my personhood.  The average person doesn't even know that I'm not straight.

I have pride, and I support our cause every moment of every day, but is it fair to lump myself in with people who fight for our rights every single moment of every single day?  It doesn't feel right to me.  It feels like I'm standing on the shoulders of everyone who fought so that we could feel normal inside our own skin.  Like I'm pretending.

So yeah, I'm LGBT.  But I'm not worthy of the title.  I just...can't be.

Have any of you felt the same way?  Am I overreacting?  Was that jerk just saying, ""Haha, gay people knit!""  Thoughts?  Downvotes?

that their attraction to one gender or another 
consistently waxes and wanes?",66,14,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/fhrtg/dae_find_that_their_sexuality_is_rhythmically/,"I've not talked about this very much, and perhaps that's why I've only ever met one other person in the world who described their bisexuality as manifesting in this way. They seemed as surprised and delighted as I was to have found ""somebody else like them"". Let me explain:

I'm a 30 year-old bisexual male. I've been consistently attracted to both men and to women for as long as I've been sexually attracted to anybody. However, we're not all wired the same way. I've met people who've descibed themselves as 50/50, 70/30, or even 99/1 and still self-defining as bisexual. That's fine by me, but I don't even know how I'd begin to describe myself in those terms.

I find that at *any given moment*, I'm either more attracted to women or to men. I visualise this as being like a sine wave (with a period of about six to nine weeks: I decided to plot it as best I could on a graph a few years back, by graphing my porn consumption - yes, that's the kind of geek I am), with me gradually sliding up and down some sort of internal Kinsey scale. I tend to vary between about 40% and 80% heterosexual, by attraction: there are clear moments at the extremes when I'm clearly ""more attracted to men"" or ""more attracted to women"".

* Does anybody else find that their sexuality feels like this? Is it really as uncommon as it seems?
* For those of you who feel like you're ""static"" 50/50s, 70/30s, or whatever - how do you know? How does it feel?
* Or am I just a weirdo?

Let me know what you think, bisexxit!

This is my long story that ends with me finally accepting my bisexuality, and never been happier.
The hints:
Through the years there have been numerous hints. When I was younger I remember watching a real sex and it was the homosexual side of the porn industry and two guys were kissing I immediately turned away. Dismissing the way it made me tingle as disgust. Being raised Texas baptist in a small town by good ole' boys, homophobia was imprinted on me early. Then while at a concert once I let a smaller feminine guy in front of me so he didn't have to see around me. This place was a gay club some nights of the week, but this was a get up kids show I think. Well we were pressed up against the barricade, and I was a lot bigger at this point(spent five hours a day in the gym, meat head style big). Well the crowd was pushing us against the barricade and I used every ounce of my strength pushing against the barricade so I didn't crush the guy. Some point during the night he started bouncing his ass against my crouch making sex moans and faces. Actually kinda hot. But I remember thinking I would fuck the shit out of you. I was aroused, because I was half brain dead when I realized my buddies right next to me were like WTF. I just gave my friends a ""psh, this guy gesture"" and went back to the show. Brushed it off and forgot about it for a long time. Then when making out with other guys was the cool thing to do(my chemical romance and the used guys started the trend my junior or senior year). There was this guy I want to make out with, but I confided this to a friend and she set up a ""lets determine if your gay make out session "" with this guy I was not attracted to and just wasn't past all my own bullshit yet. Couldn't do it. There are many other hints but these come to mind.

The incident:
Well I put it all behind me, and was working at a restaurant that had a couple of gay guys. I was a physically fit &amp; ripped back then, so I was hit on by guys and girls alike(usually guys a few years older and younger girls. )I enjoyed the attention and responded flirtatiously to all who hit on me, while identifying as straight. I flirted over the top with the guys though so it was obvious I wasn't truly interested(or so I thought) but while letting them know I appreciate it. Well I was at a party with all my coworkers and I get followed in to a dark bathroom and pushed against a wall and start getting a blow job. Feels amazing then I ask ""what are you doing?"". A mans voice shooshes me, and I know exactly who it is and I had no attraction to him. I freak out, I was insanely drunk and tried to push him away, but my pushes had no strength. It was like the nightmare where when you punch somebody with all your might but they land like pillows. I go fetal trying to cover my self and crying, but the guy continues and just pushes my arms out of the way. I don't understand what is going through this guys mind because I'm limp and he actually picks me up and manages to get me on his back and tries to get me to fuck him. At this point I realize he thinks I want this. So I tell him not without a condom, and he put me down and I attempt to go fetal again. I finish and I'm crying and plead for him not to tell anyone. Call a friend to pick me up. (The fact that I came actually confused me for so long, I assumed ""it must have meant I wanted it"". I actually found out on reddit that I would have came whether I enjoyed it or not because the autonomic system controls that, not me. I was questioning at this period i didn't get to eased in to my intimacy with men. I was thrown into the deep end by this asshole and he made it something dirty)

Dealing with the incident:
I spend a week in bed depressed going to school and putting on a happy front. I contemplated suicide every day while just laying there in bed, so confused about what this means, angry at myself for not fighting back harder. I hated him. I hated my self. He text me weeks later saying if it doesn't happen again, he'll tell every one we know. I told him that I've thought about killing my self and he just told me I was fine with it up until he decided to tell people, that he doesn't care if I'm suicidal. I tell him forget it. I decided to kill him. I quit that job, got away from the guy and planned his death for years. I still don't know if I would have done it. But I had it planned out in exact detail if the opportunity arose. Patience was my greatest weapon, I was ready to kill him because he took my will to live so i was justified in taking his life. I didn't even know the guys last name and refused to because I was afraid of what would happen because that would make him to easy to find. This goes on for two or three years. I have a girl friend, brake up with her cause I have to bang chicks and prove to my self I'm a man. A few emotionless hookups and burnt bridges later After a lot of soul searching I realized I truly loved the girl I broke up with. We get back together. We were church going, and at a revival one Sunday. One of those days you're over whelmed and they called us to lay down the thing we've been carrying for so long. To lay it at the alter, that The Lord wants your burdens you've been carrying. It was like this weight that had been getting heavier and heavier, for three years, had Been lifted from my shoulders. I've never felt such relief before. All this anger just went away. I was once again a big balling mass. That day I threw away my plan to kill this man. I forgave but could not forget. The thought of what happened to me would creep up my spine. I would do my best to shake it and dismiss it as disgust for the homosexual act, which I now know was my disgust for being molested. I recently realized I was in the ""drunk girl taken advantage of at the party"" scenario. I realized although I didn't want to kill him I hadn't truly forgiven him. One night I was working out and listening to this American life. The story that day was about A man that was raped, he planned the guys murder, let it go, confronted him, and saw him for the weak and pathetic man he was. (If you recognized the story a name would be appreciated)I identified with this story so much I broke down in tears, I was driving home because I had to leave the gym so I wouldn't cry in front of everyone, ended up having to pull over I was so overwhelmed. Because I had heard through friends that the guy who had molested me had tried it on other straight men we worked with. I realized this man was obsessed with something he couldn't have so he would attack straight men and he truly believed they wanted it. My attacker that had weakened me to nothingness and that i had believed had strength over me was reduced to truly pathetic nothingness. That mans story saved my life, I wouldn't have killed my self, but my life isn't under the thumb of my attacker anymore. I actually felt sorry for him.

Life after coming to terms with what happened to me:
 I'm in a committed relationship with a beautiful women. But at 23-24 I figured the questioning should be over by now if I truly had no interest. The hints were weighing on my mind and the no longer looming association between molestation and homosexuality allowed me to no longer be closed to that part of my self. So I decided that I would watch gay porn. I wouldn't turn away, I wouldn't let my self turn away in disgust at what I saw, I would watch and take it for what it is, if I liked it fine and I would explore this part of my self. Truth Is I loved it. Not so much the rough stuff. I just happened to stumble upon some very intimate stuff. Kissing, and cuddling mostly and just gentle and loving. It made my whole body tingle like I was a little kid that got his first kiss. I thought it was beautiful. I've since realized that I had some deep imbedded self hating homophobia from my upbringing. Not intentional from my parents it was just how they were raised. when I let my self accept who I truly was the homophobia just sloughed off. little by little they were revealed and I was just able to move past them. Like before when I saw things on a guy that I found attractive I'd look away almost immediately Not allowing it to register as attraction, not anymore. Or shaking off homosexual day dreams or thoughts as something that just happened and I had to dismiss, but wouldn't do with straight day dreams.

Today: I now know who I truly am and I am discovering further each and every day. Even typing this out things were revealed to me. Favorite thing, I'm no longer confined to the ideal of the manly man. I don't feel any less manly, but i don't have to puff up my chest and exude manliness. The day I told my self I was bisexual was the second time in my life a weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I still believe in Jesus Christ as my lord and savior, and finding out every day more and more that even if I were in a relationship with a man, that it would be ok too. I've only come out to my brother, who was extremely supportive, I'm debating on coming out to my girl friend who I plan on marrying, but I'm very afraid of losing her. Any advise there would be great. I am equally attracted to men and women, and could see my self in an intimate relationship with either, but I Have my types in both areas, and this is my coming out story to reddit under my new name. Love y'all, because of r/bisexual, r/lgbt, and others I've come a long way I wouldn't have been able to on my own. Your stories and pride give me strength.

GB ends up talking to one of the guys for a long time at the party but nothing really comes of it. I talked to GB about it the next day and GB had a conversation with the guy that went something like this

GB: So you've never been with a guy?


other guy: No.


GB: Well I've been with both girls and guys so I know that I like guys. 


OG: I've definitely thought about what it would be like to be with a guy.


GB: Well, you won't really know if you like it until you try it.


He has said things to this effect before and his mentality is so frustrating to me. Straight people (and now apparently gay people) never have to prove their sexual orientation to anyone. I have never felt the need to prove that I like girls to anyone. But here my best friend is, basically saying that you can't know your sexual orientation without experience. It makes me rage.


To make matters worse, one of GB's roommates just came out to me as queer. I have been kinda venting to this girl a lot about some things that GB has said recently and now she's been discouraged from coming out to GB because she thinks that GB won't take her seriously, just like it appears he doesn't take me seriously. 

I should add that apart from this situation, he is one of the most amazing people I've ever met. He's my best friend and I love him a lot.

(NSFW),59,11,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/11kda6/share_with_me_your_stories_of_your_first_bisexual/,"Okay, I've been reading through all these posts about peoples' first experiences and how their really confused emotionally now, which is fair enough. But I don't have any inner turmoil going on about my bisexuality, so I'm gonna just tell you my story for the hell of it.

So. Me(17/m), at my dad's place, other side of the country from where I live with my mum, about two years ago. We went to one of his friends' house, someone I'm supposed to remember from when I was 3, you know how parents are. Introductions happened, as boringly as they do, then her son came out to say hi.

A year younger than me, but just... Something. I don't know. To this day I don't know what it was; there was just something incredibly alluring about him, let's call him... John. We spent the day there, playing board games, having laughs, enjoying the day; much more than I'd expected to. Then my dad asked when they were next to free to catch up again. My breath caught, aching to know when I'd see this gorgeous piece of sex again. John's mother  (Yeah my dad's friend was a chick, realised I didn't really mention that earlier, CBF editing) regretfully told us that they were going on a week long camping trip in a couple of days, I saw an opportunity arising, as my father and I had no plans for the entire holiday, we kinda make it up as we go along. I asked politely if we'd be able to accompany them, to which both parents, and John, excitedly agreed.

Fast forward two days, day of the camping trip. We'd raced around town, buying tents, sleeping bags, fishing rods, supplies; as you do. We arrived at John's house, bundled our stuff into their 4WD and off we went. An uneventful drive ensued, only to have us arrive at a caravan park... I was disappointed in the sense that that is in NO WAY a camping trip, but I got to spend time with John, so I stifled my outrage.

That night, John and I made our way to the shower block, ready for a nice hot shower after a dull, monotonous drive. We, perhaps fortunately, only had one bottle of shampoo between us. When the time came for him to use it, I peeked my head under the partition between cubicles to pass it to him. Seeing him naked seem to shock him at first, but seeing his glorious body, I couldn't resist sliding my way under the partition.

He'd relaxed by the time I stood up, facing his dripping, wet body; fucking him with my eyes. Almost simultaneously we reached down to each other's penises, began fondling each other, rubbing, jerking each other off. Soon, horny as bush of roses, I dropped to my knees and began blowing him. The feeling of his rock hard dick in my mouth, coupled with his stifled moans had me reeling with elation and pleasure. Eventually he pulled out and dropped down onto me, began blowing me. The pleasure I'd felt at his moans were nothing compared to the sensation of his tongue flitting about on my dick. We kept jerking each other off, swapping about blowing each other until we both climaxed on each other, the shower washing it off as we eyed each other.

Without a word I slid back into my shower, turned it off, began drying myself, dressing, and we both left the showers, straight-faced, as if nothing had happened. We dodged our parents' curious questions, saying the showers had good water pressure and such. We never talked about it, never mentioned it, but without needing to be said, it happened again and again every night for that camping trip.

Best week of my life.

Anyway, every time I'm dating some new guy, my mom wants to know all about him and asks about forty million questions. But if it's a woman, she doesn't seem to care. It's like she just wants to wait it out until I break up with her and get back to dating some guy. 

But I know my parents are not homophobic or anti-gay. They are very liberal. My high school best friend is a lesbian, and my cousin and aunt, and they are completely comfortable with it.

I'm dating a wonderful woman right now, and I just want to be able to be open with my family about how much I like her. But they don't seem to want to know. And it makes me really sad.

Yesterday morning, I recieved a facebook message from my dad telling me that I was to never have sleepovers again. This confused the hell out of me, so I asked why. His response was ""Hetero girls don't have sleepovers with boys, so bisexuals don't have sleepovers with anyone!""

At this point I was very confused, because a) I had already outed myself to my mom, all of my friends, and my facebook says ""Interested in Men and Women"", so I thought he already knew and b) if he hadn't known, how did he find out and why was he bringing this up now? 

I looked on my timeline to see that in the middle of the night (as a redditor, I don't sleep much), I had taken one of those facebook polls, this one pertaining to sexuality. 

So I went downstairs and told my mom that dad had sent this message, told him that I already had the sleepover conversation with my mother, and warned her that there may be a shitstorm.

I wouldn't be able to tell you if, as a bisexual woman, I'm overall more ""attracted"" to men, or more ""attracted"" to women. It means different things for each sex. I average out in the middle of the Kinsey scale, but like I said, it definitely varies.

Do other bisexuals share these feelings?

There is something I need to get of my chest, and you guys are the only ones I can/want to talk to right now. You see, there is this girl I have liked for a long time. I fell in love for the first time in my life. I was pretty sober about it, and I could see that she probably liked me too. I was happy, and I was planning to tell her how I felt about her soon. But then one night, I had a talk with my friends. We were just talking about some unimportant stuff, but then the subject changed to my sexuality. I asked my friends if it was clear that I am not straight, and they told me that it was so clear that even the girl I liked, probably knew about it (for the record, at this point I was still in the closet, only my friends knew). This made me worried, you see, if the girl knew I wasn't straight, she must have thought I was gay, which would mean I had no chance with her. I decided that I had to tell her I was bi, because that way, I would still have a chance with her. I told her the night after, and she told me that she didn't expect anything at all. In other words, my friends were wrong, and she didn't expect me to be gay at all. She told me that not only did she not have any problems with it, she also liked me. I was very happy and I was hoping that something would happen between us, but after that day, I noticed that she started to distance herself from me. Last night, I threw a pretty big party, and one of my friends decided to go talk to the girl when she was drunk. He asked her what she thought of me, and she told him that she liked me before, but that she found it so awkward that I was bisexual, that she didn't like me anymore at all. I feel so horrible now. I mean, if you love a girl, and she tells you she doesn't like you back, it hurts, but it hurts even more if she tells you that she likes you, only to change her mind two weeks later, and over my sexuality none the less. I mean, I have to look at this from her point of view, and when I do that, I can understand that it is awkward to hear that the boy you like is bisexual, but when I look at it from my own point of view, it just doesn't make any sense. I mean, what the fuck (excuse my language) changed? I am still exactly the same person I was before, the only difference is that now, she knows I am bi. I am still the exact same person I was when she liked me, so why doesn't she like me anymore? It is devastating you know, I feel so helpless. I didn't do anything wrong, I am just bi, that who I am. That's who I was when I first met her, that's who I was when she first realized she liked me. I know that there is nothing I can do, and I know that she has every right to not like me. It's just that I don't get it. I never really thought about the fact that some girls don't like it when a guy is bi, does this happen often? Do more girls consider it a turn off when a guy is bi? I don't want to lie about who I am, I really don't. If I can't be honest with a girl about my sexuality, if I have to tell a girl that I am straight in order to win her heart, I would rather have no girlfriend at all, because bi is what I am, it is part of my personality. I am really confused right now, and I really needed someone to talk to, so thank you for reading this.

I often read tons of texts pertaining to the internalized shame that often comes with liking the same sex in a homophobic society, but I haven't seen much discussion surrounding the shame specifically associated with being bisexual/liking more than one gender.

I have been struggling with accepting my bisexual identity, not only because I grew up in a homophobic home, but also because it is hard for me to challenge years of misunderstandings about bisexuality not only from my straight friends/family, but from gay and lesbian peers as well. 

I sometimes catch myself attempting to ""push"" my attractions completely on one side of the spectrum or succumbing to stereotypical beliefs about bisexuality. I tell myself that it's a phase, that I'm just another confused teenage girl, and that there's no point in calling myself bi when no one believes me anyways.

I guess I'm just feeling so alone. I don't have anyone to talk to about this, and I don't know any other fellow bisexuals.

I broke that male role-playing streak when I started fooling around with my boyfriend (take note that I've never had a gf, but I've had some boyfriends beforehand, nothing sexual though). It was like all of a sudden... ""Wow I'm super wet and extremely sensitive, and I really like getting fingered and fucked down there, this is different!"" I act and feel like a girl when I'm with him. It took me awhile but now I can have amazing and long orgasms by clit/vag stimulation. It's all so new and strange. 

At times I can't cum with him because I need to be a man. I think my turn-on is wrong and embarrassing so it's also hard to get off alone now. I'm scared of telling him the whole story because I don't want to appear or sound like a guy stuck in a girls body. He's heterosexual so wouldn't that mean he's with the wrong person? I've told him about my bisexuality and that I get turned on from my dreams about being a male or having a penis, and he seems fine with that. Another hang up I had at first was that I thought that thrusting my hips and humping him sounded too unattractive and manly, but to my surprise it makes him really hard.

I'm a guy, in my early 20's.

After years of hiding my deepest secret from everyone, I finally came out as bisexual to my best friend, who is also a guy. I had no idea how he would react, as I didn't really know exactly how he felt about the subject. I could tell he was shocked, but after I said what I had to say he looked me right in the eyes and said ""You know I don't care, right?"" 

My heart was racing, I knew I was taking a risk. I had never told anyone, not even my ex-girlfriend about it, and here I was pouring my deepest secret to my best friend that I've known since 2nd grade. The fact that he was perfectly okay with it, and even admitted that he often wonders what it's like to be with a guy made me feel amazing. I felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. It made me feel okay about being bisexual for the first time in my life.

I don't plan on coming out to anyone else (not yet anyway) but I'm not really sure what to do from here. I came out to my best friend, who I've also had a crush on for years. He said he would want to try being with a guy to see what it's like, in his words ""I'm not just going to go to Mars, but I'll go to the moon first a few times to get a feel for it."" 

I just don't know where to go from here. I don't want to force anything on him, especially being he's hesitant about trying it. I also don't want to risk our friendship over this, but damn, it feels great to have finally told someone. I'm bisexual, and I'm god damn proud.

For those who are bisexual and desire nothing more than a monogamous commitment, I feel your pain. I understand how much negative stereotypes hurt, after-all being non-monogamous and bisexual I face them too, and from all sides. I do not think that non-monogamy is for everyone, and I don't believe that bisexuals are by nature any less monogamous than mono-sexuals, actually I think that for the majority of all people monogamy is difficult.

My bisexuality and non-monogamy are linked, because after a lifetime of living with shame, of repressing who I was sexually, and living my life to what others expected me to be, I finally cracked and came out the other side a better person embracing the reality that I am bisexual, kinky, and needing a deep intimate connections and sexual variety with more than one person. It was a terrible struggle to then tell these things to my wife who saw me as the vanilla, conventional person I lived my life trying to be - and was shocked by this revelation. This led her to a lot of thinking, an attempt to understand how I could say these things and still love her and want to be with her, and better understand her own repressed desires. After some months, she realized that she was also curious as to what was out there, about her own sexuality, and desirous of new experiences and we set out to better understand our wants and needs, our boundaries and have grown together as we seek out new experiences and relationships, in our case shared as a couple.

While negative stereotypes do suck, the reality is that a higher percentage of bisexuals are ethically non-monogamous than monosexuals (I can't quote a source but this has certainly been my experience as the majority of men and women in the poly community I have met are bisexual). While there is a correlation between the two for many, I do not believe that their bisexualty causes anyone to be any less monogamous, and that bisexuals are just as capable of a lifelong monogamous commitment as a monosexual person; though in general we all, regardless of our sexuality suck at monogamy given enough time (as evidenced by rates of cheating, misery and divorce). 

The linkage is not in an inability to be monogamous as much as it has to do with what it means to be honest with yourself about who you are sexually and what you need to be happy. When one confronts societal pressures to conform and stands up to proclaim themselves to be other than straight - it is a big deal and difficult to do. When one takes that giant step and throws off conformity in one aspect of their life to embrace who they are sexually, it is far more likely that they would examine other areas of their life where they may feel pressure to conform; hence a likely higher correlation of bisexuality and atheism, bisexuality and vegetarianism, and bisexuality and non-monogamy (for the record, I am all of these things). 

My non-monogamy does not affect your monogamy; that bigots may assume you aren't capable of non-monogamy is the fault of the bigots and not mine. I am just trying to live my life without shame.

I would like to add that I had a monogamous commitment with my wife for more than 20 years before arriving at non-monogamy. I was successful at monogamy, I didn't cheat, I didn't kiss another woman (or man), and neither did she. We did it perfectly and we were miserable for many of those years; sexually unsatisfied, not honest about our needs and desires, and almost divorced as a result before opening up about who we really are - a trait which should be held as more important than sexual exclusivity in defining a successful relationship. I would further add that many of the people (bi, straight or gay) upset about people being non-monogamous have not made a successful long term commitment to monogamy, instead practicing serial monogamy, being exclusive to ne person months or a few years at a time - a very different thing than being exclusive to one person for a lifetime commitment. I can tell you that in my first five years of marriage I would not have understood how one can be committed and non-monogamous and likely couldn't of transitioned our relationship successfully, but after being truly monogamous ones perspective may change as they understand that love is about more than being sexually exclusive and that people grow and needs change over time.

As far as the unashamedly part, it isn't totally true as I still have shame - more so about being bi than being poly - and am working to get over it.  Feeling like some would want to exclude me from fully participating in the bi community for reinforcing a stereotype doesn't help with the loss of shame.",,False,,t5_2qwnx,1361838431.0,,bi,True,t3_197umt,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/197umt/i_am_unashamedly_bisexual_and_nonmonogamous_and/,

I've been bi and known it since the moment I hit puberty, however comfortable or uncomfortable I was with it at various times in my life.

In high school I used to hang out with many friends, male and female, who were bi- and gay-friendly.  I know several of them were actually bi, or gay.  I even had a few fumbling nights with a gay friend.  

But when I met the girl who later became my wife, my circle of friends had already started to change.  I wasn't sure if she knew about me or not.  But we had a fantastic sex life, and for some reason, I didn't think it was all that important to tell her.  But mostly - I was scared.  Scared that she'd leave me.  So it went unsaid, and after the kids came along, and a whole lot of years had gone by, it seemed like it was ""too late"" to say anything.  

I agonized about this here, last July - 
http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/w279w/intro_somewhat_confessional/

Despite the supportive comments on that post (and one snippy one), I just never seemed to find the right moment to talk about it.  Or the nerve.  But every month that went by, I felt more strongly that I needed to get this out.

Last Friday, our teen daughter was out with friends, my wife and I had a pleasant meal, and we were talking about the usual stuff.  It was a very good mood.  So, I screwed up my courage, and... almost chickened out again.  But, I said to myself ""if not now, when?""

The initial words were easy... and tremendously difficult.  ""So there's something I wanted to talk about... no it's not bad...  um... did you ever know, or guess, that I am bisexual?""

...

...

...  

The silence was getting painful.

Then she got upset.  ""What is this? Why are you telling me this?  Why now - what do you want?""

""I just need to live in truth.""

""Why now?  Why are you just telling me now?""  Silence.  Hurt look.

""I should have told you 30 years ago.  I'm sorry.  I was a coward about this, afraid about my image but most of all, **terrified** that you'd leave, and that would just break me.""

""What else?  You've lied about this all this time?  What else are you lying about?  When's the other shoe going to drop?  Is this leading up to something else?""

""No.  In all our time together, I have only lied about this *one* thing.  I have never cheated, or even done more than light flirting with *anyone*, no more than you have.  I just couldn't bring myself to tell you this one thing about me.""

""You say that, but you hid that secret so well, what else are you hiding from me?""

""Nothing.  Really.  I know this is a shock, and that I lied about this, and all I can do is promise you with all my heart that this was the only lie.  Whether you choose to believe it is entirely up to you.""

Silence.

More silence.  

""Why didn't you tell me.  You didn't trust me, and that hurts.  Now I don't know what I can trust you about.""

At this point I really began to regret that I had said anything.  She was in pain. I was in pain.  And I could have stayed silent on this subject.  No, actually, I couldn't have, not forever.  But part of me was wishing I'd kept my mouth shut.  I said ""Well, I could have taken this to the grave with me, would that have been better?

""NO!  You should have just said something sooner.  Both are bad - knowing, or not knowing, either way.""

""I can only say, about trust, that I have been with you and loved you for 30 years, and never have given you cause for suspicion.  We've had each others' back for a very long time.  I love you more than anyone else in the world - aside from the kids, of course - and without you I'd be broken.  I understand why you are angry, it was only fear on my part, and I'm sorry.""

I'm not going to type the entire discussion.  The gist: the bisexuality didn't bother her (at least after the initial shock), but my lack of trust in her did make her angry.  And I totally understand that.  

Somehow, I thought she might at least have had some vague idea that I was bi.  I mean, just look at my music collection.  Lots of rock 'n roll for sure, but also heavy on David Bowie, Roxy Music, Bryan Ferry; and so many hours of Joni Mitchell, Alison Krauss, other moody female singers.  And she knew that my previous GF was bi, and that I had bi/gay friends. But apparently she had no idea.

I should add that our oldest daughter came out as bi a couple of years ago, and my wife was perfectly accepting of that.  But my bisexuality was something between her and I, so I guess that was harder for her to accept.

So this has been a very long weekend.  A bit of discussion, an angry flare-up now and again, some walking away to be alone.  It actually triggered wide-ranging discussions of other issues in our marriage we hadn't been facing.  We've had a fantastic marriage over the last decades, but everything changes with time, and we weren't always addressing some of the distances that had crept in between us.

This morning, she told me that she had overreacted, and that my sexuality wasn't a problem for her, but that she was still hurt that I didn't trust her enough to say something years ago.  And I again said that she *should* be hurt by that, and that I am truly sorry. 

It's been hard, but I think we're in a better place now.  I'm only just now beginning to feel relieved that I finally spoke up.

I see quite a few people here asking if they should tell their significant other about their sexuality.  I can only say, if you are going to, do it sooner rather than later.

anyway, this has been eating at me for a while, I'm male (in case that wasn't obvious) 18, and this has been a recurring theme for a few years now.  Among a shitload of other problems and questions I have regarding sexuality (that I may or may not work up the courage to type out in the future) one thing that I can't get away from is how much I would rather have sex as a woman, with both sexes.  I mean I'm happy being a guy, and having straight and gay sex are both great (or so I hear) but there's something far more erotic to me about having sex with a man as a female, and something far more sensual/sexy/not creepy about doing it with a woman as a girl. I say not creepy, because although I find women attractive (far more attractive, aesthetically, than men) I can't help but feel a little weird thinking about actually having sex with a girl, maybe it's just a self esteem thing or a result of having absolutely no experience but I can't even imagine a way to go about it without feeling strange. But thinking about it from the other side, feels like it would not only be infinitely easier to go about getting to have sex, but it's also so so so much more sexually appealing to me to be in a softer, sexier female body and to have a man take control of me and just... fuck me, you know? on top of my personal preferences, it just seems like sex has a far greater pleasure potential for women, multiple orgasms, receiving instead of giving, longer, better orgasms, sign me up please.  like I said, I'm happy being a guy when it comes to anything but social/sexual situations, I just can't get this thought out of my head, and whenever I watch porn (I really only watch straight porn, and not very often at that)  I can only watch and say ""gee that looks a lot more fun as the girl to me"".

There's always controversy over whether oral and manual sex are considered ""sex"" or if sex is limited to penetrative vaginal or anal sex only.  As a pansexual woman this always frustrates me since oral **sex** and manual **sex** have always been mainstays of my sexuality and they are just as special and real to me no matter what the gender of the individual I'm with happens to be.  

I resent the view that non-penetrative sex doesn't count because it basically implies that the sex I experience with women isn't real and only the sex I have with men is real.  It even limits the sexuality I've had with men too.  I consider my sexual debut to have begun with manual sex at 16 and for me I found that the non-penetrative sex I enjoyed between then and when I actually had piv sex the first time at 21 was just as special and real as the penetrative sex I have now.  In some ways I was so experienced with kink, sex toys, anal play (masturbation with toys) and non-penetrative sex that piv sex wasn't all that consequential for me, its awesome but no more so then any other kind of sex.

Ultimately, I wanted to discuss this with a community that had a greater understanding of sexual diversity and fluidity, what are your thoughts?  How do you define sex?  Is it different depending on the gender of who you are with?  How do you define virginity?

On the virginity thing I'll note that I personally don't believe in virginity as a social concept since its archaic, sexist, heteronormative and limited and its used to hurt and shame people more then anything.  I like to think of first time sex as a ""sexual debut"" a celebration rather then a loss.

This could be one of those OMG RYAN GOSLING IS SO HOT posts, but it isn't... sort of.

Last year, I slept with my best friend.  It was the first time I opened my mind that far, and just let everything fall into place.  I knew I was bi years before, but I was just so apprehensive with experimenting with the same sex.  It was so incredible.  I have slowly been more open with my roommate, in small small ways.  I owe him the respect of telling him that he is living with a bisexual.  The biggest tip off, was that he witnessed the walk of shame that my best friend had last year.  He thought it was a one time thing, I was kind of drunk, so he just brushed it off.   Slowly I have been dropping more hints, like putting [this](http://i2.listal.com/image/680144/600full-marlon-brando.jpg) as my phone background, and being more open about attractiveness of both sexes. I still haven't said it. I still haven't said ""I'm bi.""  

I know he knows, and he is very ok with that. I am watching this movie, and I just watched the scene with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone spend the night and just talked.  The great part about being bi, is that I could imagine myself in both of their positions. This is the first time that happened with anything. I have never imagined being so open with another guy, and to be honest I have never been that open with a girl, either.  I know it is just a movie, but I know that one day I can, and will do something very similar with a girl or boy I like.

The first step to that is being open with myself, and the people around me.

Hi heteros! Thanks for taking the time to read this. I appreciate your willingness to hear about my feelings on my bisexuality. I came out to my friends when I was 15, my mom when I was about 19 and my dad I think around the age of 26 or 27. No one, and I mean NO ONE, was shocked at the news. Both mom and dad pretty much said, ""Yeah, I figured."" Apparently it's common for you straight people that are close to us bisexuals to have some idea before we tell you, or even before we realize it ourselves. Still, it's a HUGE deal to us. We wrestle with wanting it to ""go away"", with being in denial, and with shame and self judgement. But eventually we admit to ourselves that we are attracted to both sexes. Step one: done! Then we move on to the conflict of the simultaneous desire to hide our bisexuality, and the need to be honest with those closest to us. Pros of coming out: Not hiding same sex partners, not having to lie to loved ones, increasing tollerance for future generations of bi's, not having to sneak around, becoming closer to accepting family, having the support of others should we ever be discriminated against. Cons of coming out: Gah! Talking about sex with parents!; fear of you not believing us, disowning us, being ashamed of us, or respecting us less. For guys, fear that you'll think we're gay, that we have AIDS, that we're pussies, or that we're gross. For girls, fear that you'll think we're just saying that to turn guys on, that we're sluts, that we're just confused, that we're lesbians, or that it's just an excuse to cheat on our boyfriends. So yeah, it's a pretty big decision. We choose to come out because we trust you and we want you to understand us. Our ideas of sexuality aren't one size fits all though, so if we come out to you please make an effort to understand us as individuals. Not all bisexuals are the same, and since I've put so much effort into the decision to come out to you, please don't make assumptions about me based on the actions of others.

I've been wondering if I liked men since was 16. I started experimenting with other males at 18. I think I've known that I'm bisexual since I was 19, but was unsure about telling other people because I didn't know if it was a ""phase"" or f I could ""own it"". I've been thinking really hard for the last couple of months about who I was going to come out to first, my sister, my best friend, my mom or a friend that was gay. I didn't want there to be a lot of fanfare, so I figured that instead of having a ""coming out"" I would just openly express my bisexuality in my life. For the last year almost, I've been discussing my attraction to males openly, kissing men when people who know me are around/in eyeshot, and so on. No one got the clue, everyone was still convinced I was straight, and if I got ""caught"" looking at pictures of hot male models, people would just joke about me being gay, but never legitimately question or ponder if I was actually not straight. Anyway, last night it just kind of spilled out of my mouth. I was with four friends, three straight males, one straight girl. The girl commented on how she wished there were other girls here so she could discuss how hot some guy from Les Miserables was, and I just kind of blurted out that I liked men. It felt great. I loudly declared that I was bi, and I was really hoping that my friends would all go ""Oh we knew all along"". Instead, only one readily believed it. My best friend (a male, who I made out with once my sophomore year in college) rationalized that I wasn't bisexual, and that I was ""method acting"" as part of an extension of a conversation we had earlier where I said method acting was unnecessary and pretentious. After about half an hour of arguing, he remained convinced that I was straight, despite the fact that: 

- I frequently ogle men when he and I go to the gym 

- I often comment on attractive males I see in public or in movies 

- I kissed him on the lips sophomore year 

In the end everyone else was unsure that I was serious except for one, and I was uncertain what to do after that. I'm very masculine but not in the stereotypical ""gay bear"" kind of big and hairy way. I also have a reputation as a lady's man, but sleeping with girls isn't incompatible with being bi, so I don't see what the issue would be. No one believes me &gt;_&gt; What do I do?

This is really frustrating considering that I live in a pretty pro-LBGT rights area and this group of friends has a bisexual female in it and no one ever disbelieved her or thought she was acting or joking, despite the fact that no one in this has ever seen her with a girl and I have been non-chalantly engaging in same-sex activity in plain sight for a significant amount of time.",,False,,t5_2qwnx,False,,,True,t3_185rgv,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/185rgv/attempted_to_come_out_last_night_no_one_believed/,

Last night I got outed in front of this guy I'm interested in. Quick intro to myself: I'm 18, in college, bisexual, not a throwaway. Yeah. So anyway:

I've known this girl, lets call her Jill, for a bit. I've played games with her boyfriend and I always thought he was kind of a dick (I felt he put himself before others too often). So Jill was angry at me for not loving her boyfriend, so she's yelling on and on. 

Then she asks me. ""Are you straight?"" I was insanely taken aback. Most people don't go around trying to out others in public. I didn't want to say yes though, since I'm not straight and I'm not trying to hide it, AND the cute guy was there. So my options were kind of limited. 

I said no, and she said ""Oh okay, now I don't hate you. Now you're cool!"" 

So, this is where I need your advice. Being outed isn't the worst thing, I'm not trying to hide it. It even made the future of coming out to the guy easy. However, me being bisexual is not what I would say is a defining feature of my personality. So, I'm looking for advice here. 

What should I say to her. I don't want her going around thinking it is okay to not only out people publicly (without even talking to them in private), but to also judge someone specially for their sexuality.

I was walking (interestingly enough from my civil liberties and constitutional law class) to my dorm. One of them is a friend of a friend, who apparently heard that I'm bi.

They walked up to me, put themselves between me and my destination, and one of them grabbed my arm as she said something along the lines of ""Jesus loves you, and wants you to stop your evil ways"", then another one quoted leviticus, and then started saying how homosexuality is the devils work, and how I'm conspiring with the devil with my (and yes, they actually used this word) faggotry.

1353115942.0,44,self.bisexual,13bx48,Elevator ride suddenly turned me bi? Is this unusual?? Please help!,63,19,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/13bx48/elevator_ride_suddenly_turned_me_bi_is_this/,"20 yr old female college student here living in an apartment on the fourth floor. One day a few months ago I got into the elevator and had the most shocking reaction to this girl. I hardly remember what happened I was so caught off guard—I think I might have asked her which floor she lived on and pressed the wrong button for her. When she didn’t get off I looked up and just the way she smiled at me I literally melted! I’m a 5’ tall dark glasses brunette, and she must have been at least a 5’8” beautiful round faced blond, the type that simply doesn’t exist in reality. Just thinking about her smiling down at me makes me blush again, she definitely noticed my reaction and chuckled to herself. I think she told me what floor she actually lived on (my own) but I just stood there unable to formulate speech I was so caught up. I don’t know if she understood why I acted so instantly shy or if she could read why I would blush like that, not just out of some misunderstanding in an elevator, but how I felt internally when she just LOOKED at me. She got off at my floor and I noted she lived somewhere down the hall, but one of my roommates distracted me as I approached my own place. As soon as I got back to my room I just laid on my bed in complete confusion with myself.

Fast forward to a few days ago. I was sitting in this common area doing homework with some friends and just as I looked up I saw the back of her head entering one of the apartments. All of these emotions sprang up of wanting to talk to her, then being too nervous, then feeling so excited that I just knew where she lived (omg I’m such a creep!) I’ve never ever EVER felt this way about another girl and ever since that first elevator ride I’ve caught myself… dare I say it… checking girls out! I have preferences and tiny fantasies, but I still feel confused about this side of my sexuality. I definitely find girls attractive in the way that I can point out qualities that I prefer, but when I think of them in the same sexual way that I find my boyfriend I kind of just freeze. I use to feel jealous of good looking girls, but now I just get these crushes! I think about kissing and touching, but anything beyond that I find too hard to face. Is this just a phase?? I keep having nightmares where my teeth fall out and I’m surrounded by angry girls! I have trouble falling asleep at night just wanting to explain to myself what it means to feel this way, wanting to decide my preferences, especially because I want to talk to my boyfriend about this. He knows something is bothering me and I’m not one to hide things from him. We’re going through a little bit of a rough patch (not sure if it’s related to my confusion) and it’s something I need to talk to someone about, so I guess this could be my coming out post. 

*So girls/guys, did you have a defining moment in your orientation that changed the way you felt from that point after? Or is it strange that these emotions hit me so suddenly?*

**TL;DR** had an awkward elevator ride that made me suspect I’m bi, and now it’s become an anxiety issue that I want to define for myself. Not sure how to handle this.

I'm loving it and here's a little short story of why! 

Yesterday on the Subway this guy was absolutely gorgeous. He had workboots on, great jaw line, absolutely cute, nice cut muscles, just overall gorgeous. He looked at me, I looked at him. He looked away, I looked away. He checked me out, I checked him out. We kept catching eyes and then looking away. It was like a silent flirt session. It was awesome, I had butterflies in my stomach and just felt soo giddy inside! I felt very submissive and like how I would love to kiss him and touch him.. Later that day, me and my buddy were talking about girls and I was hungry ;)

The next day, I went shopping by myself and saw this really cute girl and had a really nice conversation, got her numer and left the mall feeling good. She seemed very into me, I thought she was really cute, and I got very excited thinking about what possibilities may come, sexually and even relationship wise. 

One day I'm checking a guy out, the next a girl and I hit it off. I find it very powerful that I am soo comfortable with who I am, and maybe my inner confidence and comfort in my own skin is attracting people to me. Who knows? I don't even think it's worth coming out until I am seeing a guy, but not lying to myself anymore is exhilarating. I can definitely get used to this!

I'm an 18 year old bi dude who's been out for around a year. I've only slept with one guy who was a close friend. Until very recently, I've been extremely nervous talking to guys with a romantic pretext. This advice is more for men, but can work for women too.

A while back, a great man by the name of Joel Simkhai made an app for smatphones called Grindr, which was created to let localized gay guys connect, date, hook up, and chat. Grindr is discreet, and allows you to be as anonymous as you want. 3 months ago, I automatically went into ""bro mode"" whenever I hung out with a guy, almost as a defense mechanism (most of my male friends aren't comfortable with me being bi). As you can assume, this made me a horrible date. Every guy I went out with would leave without a followup text or call. I didn't get second dates. Ever. 

My advice is simple: use Grindr (or if you're a bi gal, Blendr is a less popular version that accommodates Lesbians and Heterosexuals). It doesn't matter if you ever meet these guys, give them your number, or even have multiple conversations with them. For me it has been a confidence tool. I just chat. Talking to a large variety of gay and bi guys has made me a lot more comfortable with flirting/hitting on men. The fact that it's broadcasted as a hook-up app means every guy who starts a conversation with you is interested in you, and every guy you talk to is at least interested in men. In addition to all that; ever guy you talk to with the app is (somewhat) close to you, so you can go out and date men in your area.

I understand Grindr has gotten some bad rap for being a hook-up only app like Craigslist, but it can be used for so much more. If you have trouble talking to the same sex in a romantic way, Grindr and Blendr should help you out. It really has helped me :)",DISCUSSION,False,,t5_2qwnx,False,,bi,True,t3_z5dfe,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/z5dfe/advice_how_i_became_comfortable_with_samesex/,

""There has been something I have been meaning to discuss for some time now. Something which is very personal and very significant to me, and very difficult for me to discuss openly. This is because my attempts to discuss it are met with disbelief, criticism, and generally unpleasant responses.

By now you probably have a good idea about what I’m trying to say, but perhaps not exactly. I am saying that I am, and always have been, bisexual.

Whether you choose to believe me, or even choose to believe that bisexuality is a legitimate sexual orientation, is entirely up to you. However, please do not tell me that I am wrong about it.

I’m not holding any grudges, though. I understand how and why you would feel sceptical about it.""

But I want us to take a moment and reflect on those moments where being bisexual felt AWESOME.

I was at the end of a rehearsal night for a show.  The girlcrush - who had dragged me into a bathroom two months previous for girly-sex fun - was being extra flirtatious with me.  The boycrush saw the girlcrush making moves on me, at which point he tied my thin scarf around his own neck like a leash and handed me the other end.  My actual boyfriend was laughing his ass off at this show.  As I apologized to the girlcrush and dragged boycrush into the next room, I thought ""Goddamn, I love being bisexual.""

I wanted to give a brief backround of myself and outline my issue. If you are willing to read my post and would like to reply ... it would mean a lot to me. I want to be honest with myself and I havent been able to do that, when I cant be honest to those around me .. hiding who I am. 

I'm not a teenager having a sexuality crisis, I'm a 28 year old male ... I was in a relationship with a female  the beginning of my adult life till my mid-twenties. Once that relationship ended, I was free to meet many people and feel many feelings that I otherwise have not been able to embrace fully. I, as a human, can not simply shut off my feelings when I am attracted physically or emotionally to a male. I just lie to myself and tell myself I am not so that I can keep living a lie. 

I have a great family and great close friends. I believe that these close friends would accept me and understand. I also believe some might even already have had a feeling that I might not be entirely 'straight'

As I have grown older its becoming harder for me to be myself and not let my true inner self be released. 

Plain and simple ... I can and am attracted to both sexes. Not entirely in a sexual way, but very much so in a emotional / relationship way. 
What I mean by this, is I could be happy being in a relationship with either sex. I never believed love was limited to a male/female relationship but never explored the possibility of my own happiness dating a male. In many ways, the stereotypes, media and even the internet have given me a false sense of how I should feel. I have never asked for help or reached out. 

I also had this negative mindset, that if I liked males ... I was 'suppose' to want to have sex with them ... but its not about sex for me. Its about being happy and finding someone in this life ... male or female  ... to spend time with. I have met not only males but also females that I could be deeply happy with and sex is not exactly very  important thing to me. In a way I can be a little asexual at times to. It really depends on my mood. 

 I want to be open and explore both these possibilities freely and I want to be accepted by those close to me. I know I could be happier in my life by doing so. 

Im scared out of my mind and I need to admit this to someone close to me soon and not scare away any friends, so that I can feel free and happy. 

Any advice?

I knew there was always some weird feelings that I had, but I didn't take time to figure out what they meant. I thought I might have been gay, but when I realized I still liked girls, I concluded that I was straight (I guess I did't know much about sexuality back then)...

Lived in college with each other for over a year and have developed a friendship between us that is deeper than anything I've ever experienced.  We share everything with each other - there are no secrets between us and we love spending time with each other no matter whether its two minutes or two weeks non stop.

Firstly, we both identify as straight males - we both have had gf's and both hook up and sleep with chicks.

Over the last few months what seemed impossible happened, our friendship/bromance got even stronger after we both helped each other going through personal issues and now we jokingly admit that we're basically in a relationship without the sexual connotations.

The confusing part for me is that it seems like it's still going even further and it's hard to tell whether its joking or subconciously serious.  We call each other babez in out text with x's and o's at the end.  We happily sleep in the same bed together spooning after some big nights out if we've gone back to have beers and our usual chats.

When we get in arguments and end up resolving them pretty soon after, in all seriousness we tell each other that we love them.

We go out for meals just the two of us every once and a while and when I pay I usually get the comment from him of 'I'll give you a bj when we get back to say thanks' or something along those lines.

The question I have is how you all would recommend I approach this with my mate given the following.  Given the amount of shit we've gone through together, I really do love the dude with all my heart and I feel like even though I consider myself hetero, he is the one dude where I'd be interested in trying other things out - even just starting with a simple kiss.  When we sleep in the same bed we're usually drunk and are pretty touchy feely with each other but never proceed to do anything.

How should I approach my mate about discussing where our friendship is and whether we should try stuff together?",,False,,t5_2qwnx,False,,,True,t3_1dul2c,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1dul2c/bromance_that_is_going_further/,

1365078224.0,44,self.bisexual,1bnn0i,I had my first experience with another male tonight (2 actually),50,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1bnn0i/i_had_my_first_experience_with_another_male/,"Long post and lots of details ahead. Sorry.

I've been curious about guys for about a year but only recently considered trying it. I was at home alone pretty bored tonight and feeling kind of horny. I decided to hit up a gay friend of mine and asked if he wanted to get drunk tonight if he wasn't doing anything. He lives with his boyfriend and said they were both staying in for the night and welcomed me over. I got a half gallon of gin and went out

My plan was simple enough. I was going to get wasted and super comfortable and ask them what the gay scene in the area was like. Hopefully they could eventually introduce me to another guy to try stuff with. Even if it didn't work out it was cool because these dudes were solid friends who I hadn't talked to in a while so I was down to catch up if nothing else.

Anyway, I got good and saucy and asked about the scene. I did it casually, just asking how many gay friends they had and how easy it was meeting other like minded people with similar preferences. It went fairly normal and the night proceeded.

 Eventually my friends bf went to bed and we stayed up playing Xbox and drinking a bit. He brought my question from earlier back up and eventually got me to admit I was interested in trying something different. Pretty shortly after he said he was going to sleep but offered me to come lay with him and his boyfriend, saying he ""wasn't trying to seduce me, just show me what it was like to cuddle with a man"". Being pretty drunk I said sure without showing hesitation.

We go to his room and he explains the whole thing to his boyfriend, who was cool with me laying with them. It was honestly kind of awkward, but I was drunk so I didn't even mind too much.

So we lay together and my friend and I cuddled a bit. Eventually he began putting his hand lower and lower on my stomach and I surprisingly got extremely aroused. There was some hesitation, but it wasn't very much. I guess it was the alcohol.

Eventually he has his hand right on my pubic hair area and asks me if it's okay to move lower. I said only if his boyfriend doesn't mind (he was asleep by now). So he decides to wake him up and ask him right there. His bf said it was fine just this once as long as he could watch. 

Things got pretty uncomfortable at this point. I forced myself to say okay since I figured I was already pretty far into things, but said I wanted to do a few shots first. So we all get up and quickly drink some more. 

We lay back down and toss the blanket off the bed, and my friend goes back to my rubbing my stomach and moving his hand lower until its in my pants. He unbuttoned my pants pretty fast and pulled them down (with one hand, which I couldn't have done so easily. This part impressed me for some reason) and slipped my penis out of my boxers.

I was pretty hard and after about a minute or two he moved his head down and put my dick in his mouth. I have to admit, he did a fairly good job. It felt different than it does with a girl, but it felt good

I'm not sure how long this went on. My perception of time was pretty far gone really by this point. He asked me if I wanted to go farther. Again, I got pretty nervous and pretty much forced myself to say he could try whatever he wanted that he thought would be good. I really wanted to go farther, but I was not sure at all how to initiate and it was even weirder with someone watching. I'm glad he asked the way he did.

He tells me to roll over on my stomach and gets a bottle of some sort of lubricant out of his dresser. He told me to just lay still and he'd do everything. He put what felt like ALOT of lube on my ass and pushed some in with two of his fingers. After a while he put 3 in and after doing that for a bit asked if I was ready to move to to real thing, and I said sure.

He put the tip of his penis in and it hurt pretty bad. I thought I was loosened up enough but maybe I just wasn't. But after a few minutes or so with some coaching he was all the way in (he was roughly 6 inches, I'd guess). We sat for a moment with him all the way inside of me. Caught up in the moment I took some initiative and sorta rubbed his sack against mine which wasn't as pleasurable as I thought it was going to be. His boyfriend asked if he could masturbate while we did this and I said yes.

He starts playing with himself and my friend starts doing a small thrusting action while I just sort of sit motionless. Eventually he's thrusting more and more, but it's kind of hard to tell how much. Each time I feel like he's thrusting the entire thing fully, I feel him pulling out and pushing in a little more than before. I was getting pretty loosened up, and I caught myself hoping it wouldn't end and he'd keeping pushing more and more in each time, but he maxed out on a short amount of time.

After a while he's going pretty hard it feels like and his balls are tapping into mine each thrust. Each time they touched it felt more exhilarating than the filling feeling in my ass almost. I started to let out a slight moan. Something I haven't ever done with a girl during sex unintentionally.

I feel like my whole body is numb aside from my ass. I didn't feel like I was close to orgasm, but it was intense. It was really a whole new sensation to me. As my moans are getting a little harder to control my friends bf asked if I'd help him finish. I figured he wanted a handjob so I said yes. He got up and sat himself in front of me with his dick a few inches from my face and once again my nervousness set in. I went ahead and grabbed him, closed my eyes, and went for it. Didn't really suck on it at first, more just licked and kissed it. My friend from behind sped up and it got me more caught up in the moment, and I kind of instinctively just put the whole (well most of it) thing in my mouth.

As I'm typing this it doesn't even sound real to me. I guess the details are still sitting in. Long story short I kneeled there for what felt like forever and instantly at the same time. It's very hard to explain. My friend said he was about to cum and asked if I wanted him to pull out or just let it go and I told him to just go. He pushed in and I felt a warm sensation pretty deep in my ass. I don't think he came much because it only lasted a short while but it felt oddly amazing. He pulled out and I went ahead and finished his boyfriend off. I let him cum in my mouth but I only swallowed a small bit, most of it dripped on to him (kind of gagged). Tasted sweeter than I would've expected (tasted my own once but it was very salty)

I rolled over and my friend jerked me off afterwards and I came almost instantly, and I came a lot. He licked up the little bit that was on my penis and his boyfriend got what was in my stomach 

We got up and took some more shots and laid back down. My friend said I could always come back for more but I don't know if I will. I'm kinda weirded out by being in the middle of a committed couple like that, I dont want any negative feelings to develop over time or something if I keep going back. But I think I might one or two more times.


Sorry about the long post. I'm still surprised this happened and thought I'd share it here. I love sex with women alot, don't get me wrong. But this was very different and fun in a new way which I liked a lot. So I thought I'd let you know all the details since I don't have any friends I can talk to about this aside from the two in this story.

A little background info: I'm a 21 year old female university student, and up until a couple of months ago, have only dated men. My whole life, I have been attracted to girls as well as guys, but have never ""done anything about it,"" as the opportunity hadn't presented itself, and I was unsure about what exactly being attracted to women meant. 
About three months ago I got introduced to my girlfriend, and through a series of serendipitous events, ended up dating her. It's going absolutely incredibly. To me, it feels like a complete game changer. I'm mad at myself for not having done this sooner, because it's all working out so well. 
I'd say now, that I'm bisexual (though the more I read about pansexuality, I think that could apply as well). Which is a big deal for me. I have told all of my friends, and have no issues being seen around campus together with my same sex romantic interest. 
My girlfriend, though, is a self proclaimed 100% lesbian, who has never been interested or been with guys. 
We had a conversation the other night which to me is kind of worrying. She's very insecure about past relationships that I've been in/feels inadequate. She told me that she doesn't understand how someone could be attracted to both men and women, and that she feels that women who call themselves bisexual are always more attracted to men than women. She doesn't believe that bisexuality exists, at all, and told me that she's worried I'm straight and experimenting. I don't see it like that at all. Any thoughts on this?

People around you always try to identify you as straight or gay, or try see which one you prefer or favour. I have a fluidity of sexual attractiveness. In theory it means I literally, swing both ways. It’s more about the person than the gender to me, so I don’t really feel sexual boundaries.

For example, saying you’re gay is straight-forward. No blurred lines, no confusion. But people see bisexuals as confused people, and feel they have to choose a favoured gender. They also want explanations to the choices you make, as it’s a complicated topic.

We would look at porn magazines and masturbate in front of each other, eventually leading to giving each other blow jobs.  That playtime ended in Jr. High, due to a combination of guilt and us each moving on to relationships with women.  I've always had healthy relationships with women ever since, but have always considered myself bi-curious, as I am somewhat attracted to men and not at all grossed out at the thought of a penis.
Fast forward to a few months ago, where I discover the website swinglifestyle.com, and I throw a profile on there.  Knowing that there are hundreds of single males looking to get laid, I didn't have high hopes.  There also weren't tons of people in my somewhat conservative area looking for another male to join them.  About a week ago, I get a message from a couple who has an interesting profile and some sexy pictures - they're older (I'm in my low 30's, they're in their upper 40's), but mention that they're discreet, picky, and looking to have a good time.
I chat with the wife on and off during the week, exchanging photos and flirting - I ask what they're looking for and tell her my desires.  We agreed to meet up for a drink last night, and after a few drinks at the bar decided to come back to my place for a nightcap.  They follow me to my place from the bar, and as soon as we walk in the door she's lifting her skirt and showing me her panties, and she goes right for my couch and lays down and pulls up her skirt.  I ask her husband if he's as ready to see what's under her dress as I am, and we both start taking off her clothes.  After a little bit of kissing and stripping on the couch, we head up to my bedroom.  We end up fucking for about 2 hours, in all combinations.  The only unfortunate part was that her husband couldn't get or stay hard.  She had warned me about this during our IM chats the week previous (this is why they had started looking for other people to join them in the bedroom, he's had erection problems lately and she is, in her words, insatiable...)  It was so hot to have a cock in my mouth again after all of these years, especially tasting it after he had been inside of his wife's wet pussy, but he couldn't get hard enough to cum or for me to really give him a good blowjob.  He enjoyed watching me fuck his wife and spent most of the time getting a blow job from her while I fucked her.  Occasionally I would come up and suck him while she sucked his balls, but he was having trouble getting hard.  I came twice before we all looked at the clock and it was 2am and they decided to leave.

Sorry about being a bit dodgy around here. I'm always around, but I haven't been posting much. I'm currently working on a documentary that just launched a Kickstarter, so I've been a bit preoccupied.

Here's a couple of cool things we've got planned for /r/bisexual:

* An in-depth wiki

This wiki will be *the* source for all things bisexual, created for us, by us. Anyone with an account will be able to edit and create pages, which will include topics such as sexual fluidity, and feature FAQs like ""How do I come out?"" and ""My boyfriend just came out as bisexual, what does this mean?""

The reason behind the wiki rather than a new, separate post in /r/bisexual is because there is no reason why a mod, or a single person, should have the information posted; this way, everyone has a chance to add, expand upon, and control information.

It will still be modded (i.e. abuse will not be tolerated), but this way, everyone can contribute to the conversation! Keep your eyes peeled!

* Events

How do you guys feel about periodic events here on /r/bisexual? Do you have any ideas? Other subreddits do things like: webcam chats, online Cards Against Humanity, etc. We tend to get a lot of posts asking for advice (which is great, we're here to be a safe place), but I'm sure I'm not alone when I say we need some community-building! I'd love to get to know more of you, and I think we can do so through these events.

""Now ""Little"" bro I never recalled you defending the gospel of Christ so adamantly as a St. X teen or college studen but you  now defend your homosexual life style as if it natural law. I guess a dick in the ass would make anyone this angry and confused.Well I really don't if your the receiver type or taker type but either way it just ain't right and I don't care.
 
Secondly it's not ___ its ____ [I was spelling my nephews name wrong] (See the sexual chemicals your allowing to mix within your system is confusing you and making yo testosterone all off balance ie LOW) And I teach [my niece and nephew] exactly what your bible and damn near ever other ""holy book"" teaches, ie plus nature and his-story (History) and science teaches. Why you mad that I'm teaching my children what you should teach yours YOU CAN'T, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CREATE A BABE FUCKING IN AN ASSHOLE.  But you can get shit and disease all over/in your dick. Human anatomy 101. You should take it again.
So yea I have those types of conversation with my children and I will continue to have that conversation. You can't explain what is naturally confusing. I know you just can't understand because your sexual identity is defined by the very confusion that these Europeans taught you to trust and believe in through schoolings and your so called friends. You can try and explain whatever you think might be right to [my niece and nephew] when it comes to your sexually confused choices. But in the end no man as ever trumped Mother Nature. I know you going to try and give some bullshit about a plant or something having two sexes but I got an African center explanation for even that misunderstanding,you have such Europeanized westernized thinking,(Right now your nothing more than a chocolate covered Cracker) but thank God Almighty for the Black Africans who she/he put here first who civilized and then taught this world.
 
As far as my childhood friends and our childhood, It was just that. I was a child who didn't know what using a term fag  really was and i didn't know how to express my love for my brother. I have apologized .Hell I don't even have many of those friends your thinking about. But since coming into my manhood my stance is rooted in an African Centered principal natural law fact and your public declaration ie (FaceBook) that you are in fact a Fag goes against that.  I don't hide if you were paying attention I expressed most of my views the last time we were at moms. pass emails. Not homopoic that would implied I was scared or fearful, but I will set the record straight as our African ancestors have put it down. Another thing I don't talk about yo sexuality when your not around. But to be clear whenever Homosexuality rear its ugly euro ways rather it be TV, radio, a conversation I will address my views. Rather you there or not.
 
_____ you can chose to live in the pass, you can chose to not accept my apologize. But since you and I have come into manhood, cable and understanding, able to research and make our own decisions based on your /my own foundational principals, morals, and ethics. I chose to teach life and procreation, you consciously chose to have intercourse with men which teaches death and abomination. Love you too, but you need to find your African self. and relearn everything you think you know from St X. up till now.

He's 4 years older than me too, making my childhood more complicated. He's always teased me and in the past I've felt so mistreated by him that I would pretty much burn any bridge between us. He is farmy and sporty, I am nerdy and quite bookish so I end up doing him a lot of computer-related favours.

Recently I had to reformat his computer and even though all his personal data was backed up, I felt amicable and offered to copy my collection of 2000+ wallpapers to start him off with his new windows 7. Impressed, he said yes but I forgot about the handful of sexy wallpapers with sexy cute guys in them. [Here's a sample.](http://imgur.com/lVUrE) I forget about this right up until the day (when he's back around dropping off his dog for me to look after for the weekend) when he very suddenly goes ""Oh by the way, what the fuck's up with the gay shit in the wallpapers you gave me?"" He sounded almost insulted. My immediate reaction was to just say ""Oh I got a lot of my wallpapers in a single .rar file of the net."" but the past started to rile up in me, memories of a the times I got called gay or a homo for anything slightly less than masculine and I insta-raged. I had a strong feeling of fuck-you!, I just told him the truth and said something like. ""Oh that's just because I'm bi. It means that I like guys so those guys in those pictures; I want to fuck them! [I gesture garbing a pair of hips and thrusting really hard] I'm soooo sorry in doing that job for you for free that I didn't screen all my wallpapers for stuff you mightn't like even though you're perfectly capable of doing it yourself!""

Needless to say I kinda lost my shit a bit. Anyway I was simply not prepared for what came next. He says something like ""Jesus, settle down. I wasn't trying to have a go at you, I just didn't know what to think. [he gives me a second to calm down a bit] I wondered if you were gay but I was confused since you gave me porn of girls too [I don't know why he called it porn]."" 

I was phased by the whole thing and no words came which made him feel really awkward so he ended up leaving without saying anything. He texted me later saying he didn't care about me which in knowing him I take to mean he's fine with my being bi. I felt unusual after that because for once in his life I saw some real decency in him. I know he doesn't like me and nor do I like him, but I've been learning over the last few years from various people that he does respect me. What was I expecting instead? I was expecting him to totally lay in to me with the gay insults again which would've lead to a fist fight, at least that's what I was mentally preparing for in that rage moment.

I was talking to a friend the other day and we got onto the subject of sexuality. I've always known I was bisexual, but I have more experience with guys than girls, just because that's how it just happened to work out (I'm a girl by the way). I've had one boyfriend and one sexual experience with a guy, but I've never had a girlfriend/sexual experience with a girl. Despite this I've always identified as bisexual.

So anyway we were talking about relationships and sexuality and my friend turned to me and said ""you're not bisexual. You've never been with a girl and most of the girls you find attractive are butch so you just like guys"". Of course I told him that I know I'm bisexual the same way he knows he's straight, that I'm attracted to both women and men, and although I may have only slept with a guy that doesn't change the fact that I'm attracted to girls too.

But it got me thinking, is this really how people view sexuality? That you have to have experienced sex with both genders to be bi, or the same gender to be gay/lesbian? Am I the only person who is unfortunate enough to just not be that lucky in love to have experienced enough to concider myself one particular sexuality? Has anyone else had this problem?

TL;DR- my friend told me that I can't call myself bi unless I've had sex with a girl, I'm just curious if anyone else has had this kind of attitude thrown at them?

Around this time I also ended up engaged and joining the Air Force.  This was during DADT so I didn't really think about me being bi for quite a long time, well not so much think, but not worry about it. Long story short I ended up getting divorced and got out of the military on disability.  

Fast foreword to now and I would like to come out but it's a lot harder this time for some reason.   I know my close friends will be excepting but for some reason it freaks me out none the less. I think one of the big things that's stopping me is I would want to tell my grandfather who raised me but I just don't think I can bring myself to do that.

Another thing that makes this a difficult transaction is the fact that I don't have a clue on how to pick up other dudes. When it comes to guys I'm definitely attracted to androgynous types, but again I have no clue what I'm doing.

To make matters worse thanks to my laundry list of head problems I've started to get more and more awkward around new people, a problem I've never had before.

   It all started a couple of years ago when we met in the 6th grade. We instantly became best friends because we connected so well. Almost after that my feelings for him blossomed, as so did our friendship. Now... I don't consider my self gay at all, Just a little bi curious. I've dated tons of girls who I actually loved, but Zack just always just stuck to me. 
   In the 8th grade our friendship changed. The more we hung out the closer we got. We started getting my comfortable, open, with each other. It eventually led to us giving each other long hugs, saying I love you, and staying up late at night talking.
   By the time we got to high school things got more intense. Even though we both dated other people, we always found time to hang out and chill. Whenever I would stay over at his house he would take a shower and walk out in just a towel and and get dressed right in front of me ;) boy I loved that.  vice versa. An whenever we would high five each other he would always curl his fingers so he held my hand for seconds. 
   On April fools day I decided to do something about it. I would tell him how I feel, so if he said ""man that's weird"" or ""creep"" I could always say April fools! So I said it, I said I'm in love with you. His response, ""I'm in love with you also"" now at that point I was ready to say April fools but I didn't. Because on the slim chance of me saying April fools and he meant it, I can crush any chance! So I stuck with it.
   Now we are juniors in high school. Here is my dilemma. Should I tell him how I  really feel and see what could be?  Or should I destroy a friendship that was so good and meaningful to me more than anything in the world. Any ADVISE?

It started about 2 years ago, when my best friend opened up to me about being bisexual. We would always talk about what guys would normally talk about. Sex, cars, girls, sports, and so on. 

On this particular day, my friend and I were going to grab a bite to eat and I usually talk to him about the usual. I eventually started asking more about his sexuality and his experiences. I even asked what number I was on the scale. He gave me a solid 9. Once we were done eating he asked how big I was. I then said jokingly, ""One day you'll find."" I was thrown off by it since I was completely straight and had no intentions of doing anything with him. He dropped me off home and that was that.

About a week later after a lot of thinking of the whole ""How big i was"" ordeal, I was turned on every time I would think about it. ""Today is the day"", I said to myself. ""I'm going to make-out with my best friend"". I texted him, after a couple of text messages, I told him that i might be curious also. He told me to swing by in an hour so that we could have the house to ourselves. 

An hour passed, I'm at his house. He comes outside and apologizes because his parents were home. He suggested that we just grab a bite to eat. He looked so calm and not nervous at all, me on the other hand...I was all jittery and excited. We swing by Mcdonald's and grab our food. It's a like a 2 min car ride. 

NOW FOR THE GOOD PART...On our way back I was shaking, I felt like my heart was going to explode. I thought to myself, ""I can't believe I'm about to do this."" I demanded that he pulled over. He asked, ""why? Are you going to throw up?"". I once again demanded him to pull over. We were in his neighborhood at this moment. He picked the perfect spot, this street had no lights. It was completely dark. He pulled over and said, ""what is it"". I then took my hands and caressed his thighs, grabbed his crotch. Gently running my fingers up and down his crotch area; like a slight scratch. I was getting hard also. Rock hard. I unzipped his pants. Took out his dick and started stroking it a bit. I was literally salivating by just looking at his dick. I went down and started sucking on his dick. It felt amazing in my mouth, I could feel it throbbing. It was nice and hard. I started playing with it with my tongue. When i said i was salivating, I wasnt kidding. I left his dick full of saliva, I was able to hear myself sucking on his dick. His moan turned me on and it just made me want to blow him even more. 

After about 20 min of me blowing him. I got up and said, ""ready to see how big I am"". I was already hard at this point. I took out my dick and his face was priceless. He literally put his face next to my dick to compare the size. He waved it around about until he opened his mouth. He was teasing me with his tongue. I was ready to just explode on his face, I managed to calm myself down. He then proceeded to give me a blowjob. I wasn't prepared for what he was about to give me that night, he took it all in. He put the whole thing in his mouth and almost gagged. He raised his head and said ""wow, that is big"". After 30 min in heaven. I came in his mouth and that was it.

To be honest, I was disappointed how small his penis was. It was smalled than 5 inches. I wanted the whole sexual experience. I didn't even kiss him nor did I receive or give. nevertheless,  I still fantasize about that night.

I might just get a good recommendation! :)

I think there are some more ""mainstream"" ones that are quite good. I was a sucker for *Brokeback Mountain*. Them onions. I thought *Milk* was pretty good too, and *I Love You Phillip Morris* was actually a pretty hilarious comedy in my opinion.

Of the more obscure variety, I really enjoyed *Howl* from 2010. It's a very unique film, probably not for everyone, about Allens Ginsberg, his poem *Howl* and the trial regarding it due to containing ""obscenities"". The film basically features three distinct narratives that it shuffles between: you have a biographical-interview type setup with Allen Ginsberg (played by James Franco - yum!) where he goes over various points in his life; a narration of parts of the poem with animation to supplement it; and then you have the court drama on whether or not the book should be banned.

James Franco, besides being delicious, really does well in both the acting of Ginsberg as well as the in-character narration of the poem. The animation to the poem is quite beautiful, and though it might seem out of place at first, you'll learn to love it. Jon Hamm, of Mad Men fame, also stars - playing the lawyer representing Ginsbergs publisher and is thus defending the book in court.

It's a very unique little film, and as I said, probably not in everyone's tastes. But, if you're up for something different, or happen to like either Allen Ginsberg or James Franco, then I definitely recommend a watch!

What about you guys - do you have any favourites or other good films that we all simply must watch? :)

Ok, throwaway here, but I need some advice. I've been closet bi for quite a long time, but frankly I've been celebate since my wife and I got divorced. We got divorced in 2004, but are still good friends and I still would like to do naughty things to her if the situation arose, but the important bit is we still talk and are still very good friends. This is important as my daughter is 12 and lives with me full time, and we both agreed a long time ago that arguing over who did what in the marriage is pointless and just makes it hard on my daughter.

Some more background, I had my first gay experience when I was 16 with a friend of mine, and loved it, but was kind of afraid to say I loved it. This was in a pretty redneck small town (not in the south though, just...lumberjacks). I haven't been with a guy since then, but I the idea of being with a guy again totally gets me going and makes me happy in the naughty places.

It's been 8 years now since I got divorced, and I have had maybe 2 dates with women. I get friendzoned easy so there's that, but I also know that I really haven't put forth the effort into it either. I find the rejection and frustration too much to bear most of the time, as I really thought I was finally gonna have someone for life when I got married.

With all that said, I'm wondering if I would be happier if I just came out as bisexual, but I don't want that to effect my daughter in school and all, as I know middle school is rough enough without that kind of added complexity.

So, I'm thinking of coming out to my ex wife first, and seeing what happens. I'm somewhat terrified of this prospect, but I think more than anyone I know she will be understanding.  I'm much more afraid of the rest of my family, as my dad's side is very christian, and my mom in recent years has gone hardcore fundie since moving to tennesee. 

Got any advice for me reddit?

tl;dr I'm 32, i'm bi in the closet, want to tell my ex wife first (who i'm still friends with), advice on this topic?


**UPDATE:**
So I came home tonight and was steeling myself to talk to the ex, she's actually been here staying with me for a while (long story, but like I said we're still very good friends and I was helping her out), and she pulled me aside first to say she wanted to talk to me.  She came out to me as a lesbian and explained that that's a big part of why she left as she wasn't being true to herself.  So that made it a WHOLE lot easier to come out to her as bi.  All in all, a very weird but good night.  Turns out we probably could've saved the marriage if we'd both done this years ago, but sadly that can never be.  We both need to figure out how talk to the kid about this, but she's a little more prepared to talk first as she's getting ready to move out of state with her GF, so I think that'll help alot when I have to talk to my daughter.  Hopefully should make the conversation a little easier for us.

So yeah, so far everything went better than expected.  Thanks for helping give me the courage to start this process, even just typing it out on here was a huge relief, and actually being able to tell someone about who I really am has been amazing.


**UPDATE 2**

So it's 12:30 at night, and I can't sleep now, cause my mind won't stop racing about whether if we'd been honest with each other before, would we be in the place where we are now?  How much did my secrecy hurt our marriage?  And then I started thinking about how Forever Alone I've gotten since we've been divorced.  I was never very good at dating, and have been single since we got divorced and that's been 8 years.  She's gotten married and divorced again (though she was pressured into it) and now has a girlfriend she's going to be moving in with, I'm still sitting here paralyzed with fear about the future.  I'm honestly terrified that this is just how things are gonna be.
 I know I'm just over thinking and I should just sleep, but all this has just really hit me like a ton of bricks tonight.  Thanks for letting me vent.

**UPDATE 3**

So I had another long talk with the ex, and I'm feeling ALOT better.  I wanna thank everyone for their kind words and I'm overall feeling much better about everything.  She's already told our daughter that she's a lesbian and her response was ""oh, ok!"", so I think that talk will go pretty well, just have to get myself up to doing it.  I'm also feeling as though I can trust a few more friends with this, and I think within the next few months I'll be ready to tell family.  I'm already an atheist and most of them are pretty staunch Christian, so I figure what's one more way for them to not like me?

Okay, so there is an in between when it comes to being gay or straight. Well, there are quite a few, the most commonly recognizable one being bisexuality.

Hey guys! Thanks for all your kind words and encouragement yesterday! I handed my mother the letter and basically ran out of the house because she had it open and was already reading it. I walked for a couple minutes before she texted me to say that she loves me no matter what, but that she needed some time to mow the lawn and think.

So I just kept walking. The area around my house is full of trails and woods, so I spent the next hour retracing all my childhood haunts. Eventually my mom called and asked me come home. I did, and we sat down and talked about how, though this might not be what she envisioned for me, she wants me to be happy and would never try to take that away from me. 

She did seem to hope this was a phase, but I didnt argue about it, since sexuality isn't set in stone and I can't read the future. I don't imagine going back to complete straightness ever again, but if it makes her feel a little better to hold onto that for now I'm okay with that.

She did ask about resources for parents, so can you guys recommend anything for her to read? I pointed her to PFLAG, but I couldn't seem to find any particular info on the site.

So over the days, I kept texting him. In my opinion, things were going insanely well. It's amazing to here some of the stories people have to tell. As we were talking, he asked if I was really bi or just curious? I told him I was definitely bi because there are definitely some attractive males out there. He is afraid of the fact that he has female competition and because that I have only been with females in the past, he is afraid I would leave him for a girl. It's honestly an understandable fear but rest assured, I told him I was faithful.

As the days progressed, we began flirting. It was more so a definitely different experience for me considering I have never hit on a guy really. According to him, I was flirting pretty well (I didn't ask, he jsut sort of said that I was)

Yesterday though was probably the best day. We opened up to each other as if we had been talking to each other for a long time. We both learned somethings about each other and needless to say, we were both happy. Yesterday, he admitted that he really liked me and I told him the feeling was mutual. We both learned that we are incredibly shy and nervous about meeting each other. Then, the question of where we lived and where we worked got brought up.

Not in a million years did I expect what was happening. It turns out we live literally less than a quarter of a mile apart (if even that). I was REALLY not expecting this part as well. Both of our work places are also 2 minutes apart WALKING. We both laughed and thought this was insanely awesome. So this will make for an easier meetup.

We are meeting up today when I get out of work. I'm going to walk over to his work place while he is working (he told me that would be the best time anyways) because he wanted to properly teach me how to use one of those vaporizers/e-cig things. We both agreed this will be an easy way to strike up a conversation and talk while avoiding awkwardness as much as possible.

Thank you r/bisexual for the advice in my original post!
I'll be doing 2 more updates after this one.
One to let you guys know how are first meetup goes which I will post tommorow.
One to let you know if anything relationship wise happens.

Thank you guys for reading :)

I understand I should have said something earlier but I had my reasons. I figured she would be ok with it being I am monogamous and don't want to leave her plus we have a lot of gay and bisexual friends who she adores. After telling her, explaining things, and answering all of the questions she had she said it was fine and not an issue at all and was offended I didn't tell her earlier (she was first person I ever told). Flash forward 6 months, though she says she is accepting and all is well anytime my orientation or related topics gets brought up, by myself or others, it automatically becomes a topic that should not be discussed. My SO has hinted that I shouldn't tell anybody else about my orientation. Her reason is she doesn't want people to judge me, which is BS because everyone we are friends with could care less about anyone's orientation. I also get scolded when I don't even do anything and I am sitting at a bar and get hit on by a guy even when I nicely put I'm not interested, to her I did something wrong. It is confusing and starting to get annoying her constant state of mind changing. I would be fine either way if she just picked a side of the fence. 

Does anyone have any advice to make her more comfortable with me? Or any experience with this issue?

TL;DR SO says she is cool with me being Bi, her actions say she isn't.


Edit #1: I am a guy. I would love to talk to my SO about these issues but everytinme I have brought it up my SO makes it obvious that she does not want to talk about it and it ends in an argument. that being said it makes it 100x more difficult to talk this out. 


UPDATE: As usual you Redditors were a great source for information and advice. As with everything I showed my SO (she is my wife btw) this post and all your responses. We just finished speaking about this whole topic for the last 2 hours. Most of our issues stemmed from miscommunication and just having different perceptions and feelings about this situation. After speaking about it in depth, with her fully wanting to participate in the convo, we found that we actually agree on almost everything about the topic. We went elementary school style and wrote out questions we had on our large white board and than took turns answering them and explaining what they meant to the both of us. It went very well and we were able to pinpoint areas in which we bought need to work on. We have promised to continue to work out these issues more and more.

We were just about to drive to the airport where he planned to drop me off (going back alone) and we were just leaving a diner/club next to the beach called The Elks Club. We sat on a bench out front and he turned and said to me ""So is there anything that you want to tell me before you leave? Anything bothering you at all?"" I had been trying (and failing) to tell him the whole trip, and figured that this was my last chance to tell him in person. I told him... and he was just fine with it.

Later she admitted she was bi-sexual and having female friends was particularly hard on her.

So after some deep thought I decided to let her find a 3rd person she could ‘experiment’ with.  She’s been out with a few people and has had sex with them as well.  

Reddit, what do you think about this?  I want some real honest opinions on it.

And no, I've never asked for a 3-way.  This was simply done out of my feelings that she wasn't fulfilling all that she wanted in life.  We are faithfully committed and she says it’s nothing more than a physical need and not emotional.  

Any psychologists out there that care to comment?

**Edit - addition**

I thank each and every one of you for your posts and replies.  No she never asked.  I knew the whole time she was bisexual and I saw her struggling with it.  To answer a few of your questions, when I said I'd 'let her', well believe it or not, we had real marriage vows, so when I say I let her, I pretty much said, ""I release you from that vow or commitment.""  I cannot honestly say that I understand the mind of a bisexual woman, and it's hard enough understanding a woman, but I did she the problems she had.  I saw her try to make friends and it always fell apart, or she'd get depressed.  She never brought it up but I knew the whole time.  I know it seems odd to some, but yes, once I decided to say ""Okay, why don't you date someone but just keep it physical."" Everything changed.  Her demeanor, her attitude is more positive.  She actually smiles!  She's happy.  We actually have much better sex too, oddly enough.

This isn't an ""am I bi?"" post, but more of a... practical problem?

I want to explore the idea of sex or a relationship with a man, but I've never been into casual sex; I don't think I could just go to a gay bar, have sex with someone, and ""see how it feels"", as some people have suggested.  Even if it's physicaly gratifying, I just wouldn't enjoy that.  If I'm going to have sex with someone, I want to at least know who they are first.

But on the other hand, I don't want to begin a relationship with someone, wait a few weeks, then discover that actually, oh sorry, it turns out I'm not actually bi at all.  That just seems like a dick thing to do to someone.

Has anyone else been in this situation?  Any advice?

For almost all of my life I have identified as straight. Although I identified myself as straight, I would occasionally feel something when I saw certain guys. For the longest time, I just told myself it was jealously because they were so much more fit and good looking than I was. When I was browsing the internet for porn (straight porn) I occasionally stumbled upon gay porn and admittedly stayed longer than a completely straight guy would.

I tried telling myself that watching a solo male video wasn't gay and that I wasn't gay because I still found women attractive. In fact, I only ever thought of settling down and getting married with a woman, but I still had a physical attraction to men. Up until about a week ago I have been able to be in denial, until I found our that one of my friends is pansexual.

I thought it over and had the realization that I don't have to fit into the neat little boxes of Gay/Straight. I fell somewhere in the middle. Ever since this realization, I have been overwhelmed with emotions that I haven't allowed myself to feel. Honestly, I am still in a state of emotional overload from uncapping this entire alternate side of me that I have been repressing.

I have told no one.

I don't know when/if I will be able to. I feel like I need support, but I know once it is said aloud, it can't be put back in the box. My life will change forever and I don't know if I can handle it right now, because I am still in shock from admitting it to myself. I will probably get there one day, but as of right now I needed to tell someone and Reddit is nice and anonymous.

p.s. I probably left something out, feel free to AMA.

I grew up in a very sexually repressive environment.  Admitting to having KISSED a BOY before I was 18 was a huge no-no, much less admitting that I liked girls.  I'd often have dreams about my girl friends starting at age 9.  I'd be holding hands with them and kissing them, and then I'd wake up and feel guilty and disgusting for days.   I've always liked boys too though. A lot.   

Anyways, fast forward A LOT.  I didn't come to terms with the fact that I was bisexual (despite having a wicked girl crush or two in college and enjoying female porn) until after I was married to my husband.  He's very liberal and we always encourage each other to grow...so after being married to him for 2 years, I guess I felt safe enough to be myself more freely, so I told him I was bisexual.  He said he knew before we were married, and had no idea that I hadn't come to terms with it yet. He just never saw it as anything we needed discuss because it didn't matter to him.  

I told him that I regretted not having ever been with a woman physically, and how a large part of me would always wonder what it's like.   He said he had absolutely no problem with me having a girlfriend as long as it was someone he could be friends with (that we could have over for dinner and stuff) and who was clean.  He doesn't want to be involved with her sexually in any way because he doesn't want to be with anyone but me.  I loved the freedom that this gave me, but decided it was enough to know that I COULD be with a woman without having to leave this man that I love so much.

Then I met M.  She and her and my husband have been friends for 3 years now.  We adore her little girl and she thinks of us as another set of parents.  She considers herself pansexual/bisexual and has admitted interest in me several times.   I've discussed it with my husband, and he wholeheartedly approves because she is one of his best friends.  

I have a lot of issue I've been working through with being able to get past this, but one I haven't addressed is that if I do this, I'll be a bisexual stereotype.   I'll be that bisexual that is polyamorous and wants one of each, and that sucks.  It sucks because I have been happily monogamous for 7 years, but because of my upbringing, never got to experience this huge part of my sexuality.  The only way I'll know what it's like to be with a woman....is if I leave my husband, or if I become a bisexual stereotype.  

Anyone else in this boat?

come true. That was and has been my only experience with a woman although I knew I am bi for a while before that.

After that I knew she wasn't interested in more. She was straight but somehow had not been able to resist. I didn't dare wish for more. She moved away to another state for school for a while, we remained friends.

I told my bf, I told him I was bi. It was hard for a while as we rebuilt trust but we made it and we're now married for 3 years. I was confused, I was struggling with accepting what I desired but I also loved him and do so very much.

She stayed with her boyfriend too. We kept in touch as friends but saw each other a few times a year only.

I just found out she broke up with him and is now dating a girl.

It really has no effect on me but I can't stop thinking about it.

In a way I feel it validates the time we made out, that it makes me ""really bi"" (something I struggle with from time to time...)

Having slept with a few non-op/pre-op trans women confirmed this. Genitalia means little to me in terms of attraction. But men ... I just couldn't break through. Experiences with rigid social masculinity norms turned me off of men even when I tried being intimate with them, and I still considered myself ""straight*.""

Now... lately I've been really horny, and my desire for cock has risen again in part because it's been a while since I had one. A friend of mine suggested I make a ManHunt profile. So I did. A few days later, I get a late-night message from somebody near me asking me if I want to get sucked. I thought, ""ok. May not be into him, but I've been sucked by a man before, shouldn't be any regret here."" And I went.

When I got there, this man was so nice to me - he seemed to want to welcome me intimately. He was tactful, gentle, and ... beautiful. That was it right there. **For the longest time, I've had trouble seeing beauty in men. I think the whole of society does.**

We ended up doing a good deal of sexy stuff. By the end of that night, my mind was rested and my libido had been met and completely satisfied because of this newfound sense of intimacy.

So, after many weeks of wading through the assholes and weirdos on manhunt, I finally found a nice guy who lives near me. Long story short, we are meeting up tomorrow and he's ""showing me the ropes"". Is there anything I should be doing tonight to...prepare my body...for his rope?

Seriously though, What's the best method to be clean etc? I think its obvious what I'm referring to here, I'm just trying not to be crude about it.  Any responses will be much obliged.

EDIT: Post hookup, update: 
Ok so, I got to his house, he had pizza ready for us. We had that, he showed me photos of his hometown . We threw on The Dark Knight. The movie was on mabey 5 minutes and he just went for it. Started kissing the back of my neck. I thought my heart was going to explode it was beating that fast. We were there for mabey another 10 minutes and then went in to the bed room. He went down on me and started licking my ass. I made noises I didnt even think were capable to come out of a human being. It was...exquisit haha! Then he, well...you know....fucked me like his life depended on it. Then he stood up and said ""ok, your turn"" Then I fucked him. It was so agressive. Every muscle in my body was aching, it was so intense. I think it was a bit sore for him for reasons I will leave out for fear of sounding big headed (but I suppose even saying that is implicit enough). So he gave me the almightest of blow jobs when he was goin at my G-spot....I blew all over the place. Even the curtains go it haha! Then I went in for a shower and he followed and started washing me and massaging my shoulders and shit. Things got a bit heated again so we got out of the shower and went at it again, against the wall. Then went back in to his room, chilled out for a while. Then, inevitably, things got heated again and we fucked one final time. When I was leaving, he pinned me against the front door and things WERE getting heated again but I was running really late so against my better judgement (and by judgment, I mean the will of my c**k), I left. He walked me to the bus stop. Gave me a bro hug and I was on my way. He text me then saying how awesome it was yada yada. I'm just home now and the whole thing feels surreal...but it was awesome and something I will definatly be doing again. Mabey this time with a girl thrown into the mix but I don't know if he'll roll with the idea as he's cock exclusive. 

T,LDR; We had pizza, watched the dark night and then fucked with the intensity of an exploding star. Big smiles all round :D

It went off almost perfect. I had talked with my GF and we decided that I'd invite him along with us for drinks on Thursday, just to get to know each other better and maybe see if something would happen. I met him at the gym and made the invite he was really cool about it but said he had to go home first but then we all met up later on. Hit a couple of bars, got a good buzz without getting drunk. He's never hidden his interest in my girl and was shamelessly flirting with her the whole time in front of me, I had a hardon the whole time almost lol but took several cig breaks to let them know each other better. At the end of one cig break I was coming back and they were making out mission achieved lol it was all I could do but to burst out of my pants there. She had this coy teasing look on her face that I won't forget and he just played it cool but had his arm around her and just chatting with me as if that was totally normal. What I like a lot about this guy is that he's naturally masculine and dominant and kind of a jerk but is relaxed and cool about it.

At the end of a couple of hours my gf gave me the go-ahead basically so I asked him if he'd like to come have another drink with us at my place. It wasn't far from the bar so we walked back, they were basically making out the whole time as soon as we walked back in. I thought I'd get us some drinks and they continued making out and he had her shirt off by now. I started sort of kissing her neck and he took the break to take off his own shirt, she sort of gasped at how perfect his body was and I was admiring it too.

I'll write more details later but basically I watched him put on an incredible athletic performance fucking my girlfriend for half the night, which I'll never forget. Some scenes that stand out for me are his muscular ass rising up and down up and down as he's driving his thick cock into her, making her scream and moan the whole time, the headboard of the bed banging the wall loud again and again. Or him raising her up against the wall and giving it to her hard like that. She sucked both of us off in the beginning but then he sort of took over and fucked her face and I took a backseat after that. I licked her breasts and made out with her as she got her brains fucked out. I came myself more than once, the first time without touching myself just at the excitement of watching this muscular stud fuck her like that.

Nothng bi happened but he is cocky and teases like hell, when she was taking a shower after the first fuck he basically gets up in front of me (I was sitting by the bed at this point) and rudely tugs on his cock not too far from my face, asks me how I liked watching.

He left in the middle of the night, didn't want to spend the night. GF and I are still talking about it, she's told me flat that it was the best sex she's had, and for sure I've never seen her that excited. The show he put on was amazing.
