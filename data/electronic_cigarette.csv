There's an awesome world of tobacco-free vaping beyond Blu and gas station throwaways!",1799,341,273,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1fk6d9/dear_smokers_of_reddit_try_relectronic_cigarettes/,"Dear Redditors and friends at r/electronic_cigarette,
Let's try to make the front page with the information in this subreddit. There are some people out there who can greatly benefit, myself being one of them.

I used to smoke cigarettes. I would smoke any brand, any time I could. There was a point in my life where if I was broke and needing a fix, I would regularly collect cigarette butts from gas stations, the ground, ashtrays, and make ""frankensmokes"" --little rolled up burnt nasties of the devils blend. This was destroying my lungs and self respect. I tried to quit cold turkey, with medicine, patches, and nothing helped. My wife hated sleeping with me, my family were disgusted, and I couldn't taste food.
I first purchased an nJoy e-cig on a bus tour i was doing with musicians who had a strict no-smoking policy in the bus. I didn't think I could do it, but i did. I must have bought 10-15 refill cartridges of those things and it wasn't smoking, but it was adequate. I figured there had to be another, cheaper, tastier way. 
I decided to do some internet research and I found reddit and all the helpful information on r/electronic_cigarette, and now I'm the proud owner of a set of super tasty, long lasting gear... and I'm saving money every day. I will never pick up a cigarette butt from the ground and risk slobbering on someone else's canker sore juice ever again.

If you wanna get started, ask some questions, subscribe to r/electronic_cigarette and the related subs, browse the forum, use the links to the right and make the most of this subreddit!

We would love to help you get started with some information and help you along your way to quitting smoking and to start vaping. Your life may depend on it! There are countless success stories like mine out there.
Thanks. Please upvote/send to friends!

Welcome to /r/electronic_cigarette. I'm not sure that you'll actually get to see this but I gave you this link without really explaining too much to you. I figured an introduction might be really helpful.

This is a ""subreddit"" dedicated to electronic cigarettes, or ""vaping"". The electronic cigarette you had is referred to sometimes as a ""cig-a-like"" since they're very similar to a regular tobacco cigarette (often referred to as an ""analog"").

That big thing I had is usually called a ""mod"". They're larger PVs (personal vaporizers - another word for an ecig). 

Between my mod and your cig-a-like is something called an eGo. It has a much better battery than a cig-a-like. And rather than buying those pre-filled carts online, you can buy the nicotine juice and something to put it in seperately. There are a variety of things you can put your juice in - atomizers, clearomizers, cartomizers, etc etc.

What does this mean for you?

Sections 905 and 910 would ban all e-cigarettes, and other provisions of Chapter IX would also decimate the e-cigarette industry, protect cigarette markets and otherwise threaten public health.

If this action does not completely destroy the industry on it's own this would be the first step in an all out attack on your ability to use electronic cigarettes. A ban on internet sales and significant taxes would almost surely follow.

This is the most significant threat to our right to vape here in the US since electronic cigarettes were introduced.

[Section 910](http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ucm262073.htm)

I'm not a lawyer, but it looks to me like all 'tobacco products' must be filed and described and registered by section 905 and section 910 gives the government the power to remove the product for non-compliance if they wish. I'm willing to be corrected on this if I'm wrong.  Has any eCig manufacturer / juice maker complied with 905, except Big Tobacco?

We, as vapers, do a disservice to us all with the entitled ""vape anywhere"" attitudes. Sure, vape on a walk in the park. Vape on break. But if your job says no vaping outside of designated areas? Don't do if outside of those areas. It is their place of business and they can do damn well as they please. I'm all for open vaping, but please be reasonable about it. Blowing clouds in Wal-Mart or the likes isn't doing us any good; in fact, it makes us look like annoying brats. ""No policy means I can and should do it anywhere."" No, it doesn't. Have some common decency.

Edit: didnt really expect this to blow up. Posted it up right before going into work and I come back to the discussion. I appreciate all viewpoints on the subject, even if I don't agree with them. 

To me, it's always been about common courtesy. If I wasn't a vaper, I wouldn't be overjoyed to see myself blowing a cloud of vapor which I likely don't know much about. 

I'm all for educating the public, and even more so for more research to be done into vaping. Seriously, I love it. It's gotten me off of analogs for good (well over a year now). But showing even the slightest amount of caring for those around us WILL do wonders down the line when it comes to legislation and business bans.

1373138035.0,279,self.electronic_cigarette,1hrfoa,Why Sucralose?,323,44,136,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1hrfoa/why_sucralose/,"I've always wondered why [Sucralose](http://creationwiki.org/Sucralose) is the sweetner of choice for e-liquid. I understand that it is attractive because it is 600-650 times sweeter than sugar, however, when you examine it's properties, it doesn't appear to be compatible with vaporization. It's boiling point is 669.4 °C while it's flash point is 358.7 °C....doesn't this mean it will burn before it is vaporized? In my mind this means that it will collect/concentrate on the wick at the coil until it builds up to the point where it clogs the wick and ultimately burns and/or reacts with PG/VG. I'm sure a percentage is carried with the VG/PG vapor, however, some percentage must also have the aforementioned fate. I have found a few articles that seem to support this supposition: [Here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814609005378), [here](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0100-46702009000400002&amp;script=sci_arttext), and [here](http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/R-D/Study-questions-sucralose-stability-in-bakery).

Sucralose apparently breaks down into water and HCl. At a first glance this doesn't appear to be an issue because obviously neither water or HCl (in low concentrations) are poison. The issue seems to be that HCl may react with VG and possibly PG to form [Chloropropanol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-MCPD) which is a known carcinogen. You can visually compare it with [VG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol) and [PG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylene_glycol) to see that a substitution of Cl will produce this substance.

I wasn't actively looking for a sweetner alternative when I found this Wikipedia page on [sugar alcohols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_alcohol) while looking at properties of Nicotine, PG, and VG. VG is a simple sugar alcohol. Also in the same chart is [Xylitol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylitol). It is in the same family as VG, has a compatible boiling point (it will vaporize without burning), is twice as sweet as VG (the same as table sugar), and has been thoroughly tested as non-toxic to humans.

I'm not trying to be a fear monger here...I just want to make sure that vaping is as safe as possible. So the question I have is, has anyone tried [Xylitol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylitol) as a sweetener? I plan on going to the local health food store to get some and try this on Monday.",,False,self,t5_2qmlu,False,,,True,t3_1hrfoa,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1hrfoa/why_sucralose/,

I get the vapor envy... I see those enormous clouds of vapor being spit out and think it's pretty cool myself. But here's the thing... those guys probably know what they're doing. 

In the video currently getting bumped around on this sub there is one point where I feel like the guy's being responsible. He says ""I need to change the battery, I've been vaping on this one for a couple hours""... that was an AW IMR, a battery most people talk about using 'all day'. He swapped it out for a panasonic CGR18650CH unless my eyes aren't working... batteries that are suited to what he's pulling on that mechanical mod. 

Do you know why they're suited? Do you know why he's swapping after just a couple of hours? Now... Do you know how many coils he had or how big his air holes were or what device he was using? If you can't answer with 100% certainty the first two questions but CAN answer the last few... you're the person this is for. 

Running an 'extreme' vapor set up for the purposes of generating enormous clouds of vapor is risky. You're pushing batteries to or beyond their operational capacity when you throw low ohm, dual coil set ups on a mech. 

The mechanical mod was a great idea at first... people were upset by the fact that their egos kept burning up because of the crappy wires and boards in them so they bypassed the limiting factor, those crappy wires and boards. Every chain has a weak link. If you over work an ego the board burns out or the wires fry. The battery doesn't fail... it's not the weak link. 

In a mechanical mod with a solid metal piston for a switch and 0 wires, your weak link is the battery... this is not a link you want to break while it's in close proximity to your face or anything you value more than those clouds of vapor which will dissipate a little faster than your checking account if you over tax a battery and create a little time bomb. 

Yes, to the people who will say ""it's not that easy to burn out an IMR!"" you're right, under normal circumstances it's not. But these batteries are NOT intended for what we're using them for. In fact, after recent conversations with Panasonic/Sanyo, Sony, and Samsung, they don't even like the fact that we're USING these batteries because they're not intended for single cell, unprotected use in any device. The fact that they're available can be attributed to modders of flashlights, pen lasers and bicycle electronics. A demand formed around those markets and it was filled by various folks, ecigs came along and the demand skyrocketed. 

These batteries are not built for what we're doing to them. I'm not telling you NOT to do it... don't get me wrong, I plan on making a few little fog machines myself. However, I know my batteries, I know what I'm doing, how I'm doing it, and what the implications are and how to mitigate risks. If you don't... ask, learn, figure it out and don't just take some random Youtube video, drill out your RBA caps and start blowing clouds. 

I'll give you a couple of tips but it's by no means all the info you need to have in your brain to push these set ups to the limit so please... it's better to learn before you do something to avoid a bad situation than to jump in, have a bad situation then try to figure out why later. 

1. Only use IMR batteries and only big ones. Don't do this with an 18350. Go 18650 and don't push your luck. 

2. If you don't own a multimeter, go buy one. 

3. Know your amp limits on the batteries you're using, check the voltage on those batteries and check the resistance on your coils, learn the math to figure out your amps, watts, volts, etc. Operate within the manufacturer constraints and if you decide to ""push it"" do it once or twice then stop. 

4. Check yoru battery constantly. Take 10 hits on some super vape set up... check the battery. Change it at the appropriate time.

5. If the battery gets hot... stop, take the battery out, set it someplace not flammable, wait 5 minutes and check on the battery, if it's hotter find a safe place to put it where it's not going to do any damage, wait for the battery to finish doing whatever it's gonna do (theres a variety of things that 'could' happen at this point) and when it's done, clean up. If you don't know how to clean up a failed battery, google it. 

6. If you make a video of your phat clouds... please, put a disclaimer on it, some info  other than 'omg look at teh clouds' that tells brand new vapers that  you're doing this with the proper information and that they shoudl not ""try this at home"" so to speak. 

I want y'all to be safe, I also want y'all to have fun which is why I'm not saying ""Don't do it!"" or being one of 'those guys'. but please, for the love of vaping, don't monkey see monkey do this stuff unless you've educated yourself on all the factors that go into it and how to mitigate risk.

The site automatically gets live prices of products from various vendors.

At the moment it only compares a few ecigs and websites, but with enough interest it could be expanded to hundreds, and include cartos, juices, tanks, batteries ect.

Would a site like this be useful to you?

The flavor of the wood (apple and cherry) smoke smelt and tasted amazing.... the sweetness of the brown sugar, the spiciness of the chili's... [It all blended in to make some amazing ribs](http://imgur.com/eyvsut3). =)  



Yeah, after a month of not smoking, I busted out my texas pit and made some ribs, and as amazing as my bbq was when I was smoking, it's even better now.  So thank you.

Now for the back story.

I quit smoking one month ago today during one of the most stressful times in my life.  Two months ago my fourth son was born 2 months early. He spent 3 weeks in the NICU with breathing issues.  Managing work, three other boys and a kid staying at the children's hospital is extremely stressful.  Somedays he needed to be on a CPAP machine, some days he didn't and he was being tube feed until he could have his nose mask removed.  Eventually he came home and then I promised myself that I was going to quit smoking for his safety.  I didn't want my smoking to hurt his lungs and send him back to the hospital. I started doing research on e-cigarettes and where they were compared to 2 years ago when I bought a kit to hold me over while I traveled for work.  A week later I found a local B&amp;M and bought my first kit.  A lava battery (ego knockoff) with a clearomizer and some Chinese juice. And best of all I found /r/electronic_cigarette . I felt good.  I was going to quit.

The next day my wife called me in a panic and told me that my son was being rushed back to the hospital via an ambulance.  She was taking him to his Dr. appointment and when she got there and was pulling him out of his car seat, he was blue and lifeless.  Luckily she was at the dr.'s office and they rushed to him, resuscitated him and he started breathing again.  I ran to the hospital (literally, I work about 8 blocks from it and don't have a car).  I also smoked 3 cigarettes. I wanted my mic fix now, the only way I knew I could get it fast.

We were in the hospital for another 5 days while they did any kind of test under the sun.  Blood, urine, spinal tap, cat scans, x-rays, MRI’s…. It turned out that he had contracted parainfluenza (which most people never know they get) and it was causing respiratory issues.  During the stay I couldn’t just leave and have a smoke so I went into the bathroom and vooped my crappy peach liquid in my crappy clearomizer with my crappy battery….. but I never left his room. I was always there with him.

After he came home again I threw away my stash of cigarettes. I’ve upgraded my gear, I’ve bought more juice then I could ever use and I’ve been smoke free for one month now.  Lucas (my son in all this) had to have another 4 day hospital stay a week later for more breathing issues (still recovering from the parainfluenza), but is doing good now, and so am I. One month down, and forever more to go.

Thank you everyone, this group of rag tab people has helped me in more ways then you would ever know.  I spend many of nights in the hospital reading through his subreddit reading anything I could, learning, and buying from everyone’s recommendations.

I wish, as a vendor, I could review customers and it 'mattered' in some way. 

If you guys give me a positive review it sends customers my way and makes me a happy little monkey... if I positively review customers... well, it doesn't do much. 

Reddit has been amazing for me, you guys have, hands down, been my best customers. You post funny shit in your comments on my orders,  you're understanding when one of my chinese devices tanks in a day and are patient with me as I send out replacements/store credit and in general you've just been really receptive and nice (weird on the internet...)

I can't ""review"" you but I can show you appreciation. I just started my restocking process last night since china finally woke the hell back up from their new years holiday and within a couple of weeks I plan to be launching a new storefront with a new host and some new features (Including canadian shipping.... Mr Timbits, all for you...).

I keep my prices pretty low on purpose, I didn't want to deal with coupons or ""sales"" to try and draw people in. I've run a few promo codes and stuff from contests but I really never intended to have a coupon up most of the time.

Since I can't ""review"" you, I've decided instead to make a permanent 5% coupon code for this Subreddit. I'll be posting my ""Restock"" thread as soon as my shipments arrive and I'll put the code in there. I'll be rotating it every couple of months or so to keep it fresh in the Reddit cause I know it'll spread around and turn into just a generic 5% off coupon. I want it to be special to you guys cause (and this is gonna sound a lil girly) you guys are special to me. This sub has made being a vendor a lot more tolerable and I want to reward you for it. 

Thanks for being awesome customers, I look forward to serving you and your vaping needs for as long as you'll have me around :)

Am I a bad guy?,253,50,338,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1jsbpf/i_just_made_my_bar_vape_free_am_i_a_bad_guy/,"So I run a large, high volume pub with a large patio in southern california. Both myself and the sous chef used vaping to quit analogs. We are both hobbyists and like getting all the new gear and juice we can find. Our private office is a vape den. 

I've never allowed vaping in the bar because its always packed and the vapor is inevitably going into someone's face. Plus, I don't vape in public indoor places. 

For months I had a rule for the patio, which was that discrete vaping was ok. Sadly, a few people decided to either blow gigantic sub ohm clouds when the patio was packed or simply not be discrete enough and cause complaints. Even when I would approach people and identify myself as a fellow vaper, they would give me the whole "" it's just water vapor"" excuse. I'd ask them to just keep the fog to a minimum and away from other people. A few drinks later and their back to blowing it wherever they want. 

So today I banned it after to many complaints. I feel terrible because I want to be an advocate for vaping. I can explain to people that it isn't smoke, but I can't tell them why some vapers have no manners. 

This is really bumming me out. I hate to do it but I have to protect my business. I wanted to make a vape friendly patio, but I gave an inch and they took a mile.

I feel bad for the ones that did send him stuff.

Any review or product he promotes, I cannot, and suggest you do not, take as fact, truth, or even his own opinion.

In the last comment linked, he even states he is reviewing a product for a vendor.

Some of his reviews (Won't bother linking to his blog) are nearly duplicates of the manufacturers advertising. The same companies come up over and over again (many of them who sent him things, from what I can gather)

So just be warned. This user's opinions are for sale, and you should consider that strongly before taking them at face value.

HB372 is being proposed this year which has the potential to ban internet sales of your products to residents of the state by requiring face to face transactions. This bill under the current wording could also be taken to mean that it prevents you from selling via the internet to ANYONE anywhere. This is another one of Representative Ray's pet anti-smoking/nicotine bills that he introduces each year.

This bill is being heard in the House Health and Human Services Standing Committee Wednesday afternoon just after 4pm. If you value your internet sales, it is in your best interest to attend this session with details of your internet sales volumes, employees, taxes paid to the state, etc to fight for this bill to be removed.

His bill states there will be no financial impact of this bill being passed thus it's obvious he has zero clue the amount of business done in the state. He's estimating over 1.5 million in added revenue due to taxation however his bill leads me to believe the taxation for both the ecig and smokeless products will be brought to the same levels as tobacco cigarettes (although it does not specifically state how they will be taxed or at what rate). The bill also will ban all forms of advertisement for your business which could have detrimental impact to your longevity as a vendor in the state.

The links to the agenda and the bill are here:
http://le.utah.gov/~2013/agenda/HHHS0306.ag.pdf
http://le.utah.gov/~2013/bills/hbillint/HB0372.pdf

I encourage each of you to appear 1 hour before the hearing, sign up to speak and state your case to fight this one. There are 10 days left in the session so if it is fought well, it may die in committee but will not if you as vendors don't testify on Wednesday. I encourage all other concerned vapers to show up in force to support our vendors. The more people we have up there the more they will see we cannot be silenced...

He has been bugging me to quit, gave me a prescriptions for Champix twice (ultimately didn't work both times, made me sick, and almost drove me mad, besides costing a bundle).  So, today I told him I'd quit, that I'd been smoke free since November 2012.

I showed him [my device](http://imgur.com/a/cCFc8), which he said was amazing (I am proud of it, sure gave my ego a boost as he examined it closely and asked how it worked)... and he asked a LOT of questions.

He asked about the atomizers, how they worked.  He asked if they were the same as the ones in stores... I explained they pretty much all work on the same principle, but the ones in stores were too lame to work for quitting, besides they don't contain any nicotine (Canada).  I showed him my travel case of atomizers with different juices, he was quite impressed with that as well.

He asked about the juice... I explained it was varying amounts of PG and VG, nicotine and flavor.  I also explained that I DIY my juice, he was impressed with that too, and asked if you need to do that.  I assured him you could buy pre-mixed juices pretty easily, but you have to do it online in Canada, but that I'm DIYing because I'm just that kind of guy, plus to save money in the long run.

He asked how much I used it.  I told him lately I'd been chain-vaping, but only because I love it so much, and that I was doing it with reduced nicotine.  He asked about the nicotine concentration... I told him I started at a high nicotine concentration and naturally progressed to less nicotine, and that I'm even vaping 0 nicotine juice now.  I also told him that's pretty much how it goes with these things... that I'm on a forum where others have told their stories of switching to vaping, and that most have the same experience.

He asked how it felt, whether I could feel the nicotine, whether it was satisfying like a cigarette.  I told him yes, you can definitely tell if there's even a small amount of nicotine in the juice, and although not quite like smoke, it was satisfying in a similar way.  He asked if you inhale with these... I told him, you can but you don't need to, the nicotine is mostly absorbed in the mouth and throat regardless of whether you inhale.  He said that's what cigar smokers have told him, and it makes sense.

I told him I'd been coughing up gunk... he said, yes, that's completely normal - the cilia (sp?) in my lungs were adjusting and should subside eventually (it's 6 months vaping for me now, but that's after 36 years of heavy smoking).

I gave him some cards I had in my wallet from canvape.com, he indicated he had other mature smokers who'd be very interested.

I told him that Health Canada was recommending against them due to their ""untested"" status... he was dismissive.  Not of the untested status, of Health Canada.

About the only thing I think he didn't ask was how much it cost... he just seemed to assume it was a lot cheaper than cigarettes (we really get dinged with taxes in the Socialist Republic of Canada).

As we said goodbye he congratulated me on quitting, said ""keep it up""... I promised I would.  I told him I was going now to report on that forum that I'd seen him.  He said, ""You have my blessing!""

He was telling people that ANY kind of DIY was very bad and to only leave it to professionals. He was saying that over 500 people have been killed from nicotine poisoning from doing their own DIY.
He also said that Vivi novas and other tank mods besides CE4 only last about a week on medium use and need complete replacing. Another wrong point. When I brought up Mount Baker Vapor having great DIY stuff, he said that's one of the companies he's heard of them dying from.
I had had it. I asked all the customers inside to please come outside with me and I will show them everything.
When the group had gathered outside, I pulled out my DIY stuff from my car, and explained how if a newb, buy PREMIXED pg/VG with nicotine. I then showed off some flavors I had made and gave away free samples to try and everyone loved. 
I then explained how the clearomizers do NOT die that quickly and how to properly use them and gave away vaping charts to those who didn't know. I also showed them how to rebuild the heads so they could do it on their own and save money. 
At the end of the day I had given out business cards from Mount Baker Vapor, Vape Dojo, DFWvapor, Alice in wonderland, and VCV.

ATTENTION VAPERS (ESPECIALLY SOUTH CAROLNA) - A new bill is on the books (sponsored by RJ Reynolds) that would raise taxes in this states (and other adopting states) of a minimum of 0.05 Per ML of e-liquids in state tax - this is before any applied federal or state sales taxes. 

This will also open the door for future e-cigarette taxes that we as vapers have absolutely NO representation in! Looking at how cigarette taxes have increased in the last 5 years - this is bad news for the industry - but great news from big tobacco companies like Phillip Morris, RJ Reynolds, and Lorillard.

As I read it, the tax on a ml is 28 times higher than the tax on other smokless productsi n the bill.

The CASAA call to action link is here: http://blog.casaa.org/2013/05/call-to-action-south-carolina-bill-to.html

I urge all of you to read through this - call representatives, and participate in having this tax removed outright. These are not substantially e-quivalent to tobacco cigarettes, and should not be taxed as such.

So this is federal. This will affect us all and you can bet it will be determined by big tobacco, not us.

So, one, should we have a dedicated subreddit for ecig law and protests? It seems to me that most of us, and I include myself up until now, are sort of relying on various organized groups out there to handle this for us. I see the occasional letter to congress, but really, we need something formal, national and local. Any interest? 

Second, I really, honestly don't know who to contact for this legislation. I don't think congress decides as a whole. They usually have sub committees, no? Can we find out who is on this committee? Can we find out who at the FDA is handling the matter? 

This is important guys. They are talking about only letting licensed manufactures being able to get nic liquid. Do you think Rich at Gremlin or TheVaperChef will have the money to get licensed or pay for the oversight? Nope. We will be forced to use big tobacco prefilled cartons. 

We have to do something. We have to try everything.

Reynolds 4 regulation points:

*Licensing. Paperwork and money.


*Actual labs with strict lab requirements including high tech equipment to ensure quality control and dosage. 

* No online sales whatsoever. Product has to be behind a counter where sales people ID.

* No flavors whatsoever, so kids won't be enticed.

* Only prefilled carto's will be available for purchase, to ensure quality control and dosage.

* Taxes up the wazoo. Currently 6 dollars a pack or a proposed 90 percent for state tax where I am, but add in federal tax and what's the point of vaping?

They are usually critical in nature (hence the name). I encourage comment and discussion.

There are some AWESOME liquid vendors out there, there is no doubt about that. Smoking the same damn thing for 17 years one would think I would find a flavor and be happy. No... It does not work that way for me at least. So I read and research, shop, taste, steep, test, vape in a never ending cycle for juice to add to my does not taste like satan wearing perfume pile. While I know that one persons favorite flavor is another persons ass crack... (wait that came out way wrong)

Some things I would like to see from various vendors.

1) If you are doing business on the web, you should understand some basic things about the web. If your site does not load quickly.. I am gone.. I have ADHD and watched MTV and Sponge Bob. I don't care if pbasardo came all over the place after tasting your juice.

2) For the love of god, put descriptions of the juice that are not completely existential... While having an orgasim on a warm day under the shade of an oak tree while bunnies and duckies go by does indeed sound interesting but it gives me absolutely no idea of the flavor.
Seriously... If you want to be cute.. be cute, but give us some idea of what the hell to expect.

3) Go look up sites that sell bespoke coffee, small batch roasted. Do this now.. I will wait... 

When tasting coffee (cupping) you write down the information of what your taste buds and nose are telling you. While taste is subjective of course it gives the buyer some great ideas.

(VCV Night Shift: Sweet, Chocolate, Carmel Undertones) Don't be fluffy just the facts.

4) I want to see what YOUR recommended steeping guidelines are.
I really don't want the cop-out of well some people like it this way.. I don't care about them. If I want there opinion ill look for it. I want the creators thoughts.

5) On a similar note to #4. I want to hear what your Preferred voltage is yes yes i know taste is subjective. But when I order from a restaurant the Chef prepares it for me as his vision. If I want to mix everything up into a pile, thats fine. But I want to at least see his vision.

We enjoy vapeing this at 4.9 Volts on a Standard Resistance ProTank
We feel it brings out the nutty undertones that are often missed at lower volts.

6) Blogs... Tell us about your stuff in development, tell us about your shipping times, tell us about your expansions. Customers want to be a part of there favorite bespoke vendors.

So these are the thoughts on this running through my mind..
I'll be fleshing this out and finishing the website up shortly. 

Chao!

There's research that nicotine is actually helpful in reducing some symptoms, and most sufferers of these illnesses became addicted to cigarettes to self-medicate. 

We have weekly treatment team meetings, and our office is starting to phase out smoking as an effort to comply with the state's department of health codes. When we were discussing this, several therapists and case managers admitted that some of their clients now vape, and do so regularly in session. Our director wasn't excited about this, and recommended that we have them go outside to do this. Immediately, most of the clinicians said that they're proud of their clients for kicking the harmful analogs, and some even noted how they enjoy the way their offices smell like cinnamon and cupcakes instead of ash trays. 

As a vaper myself, I was impressed at the support my fellow professionals were showing for the increased health benefits, and their attempt to fight the stigma on vaping even though they didn't do it themselves.

Appreciate FastTech's cheap knockoff clones that cost you next to nothing and take 3 weeks to arrive at your front door. 

Appreciate the fact that at any given time you can order any of 10,000 juices mixed to millions of combinations of flavors and vapor mixes without cigarette additives and embargo taxation and these juices will arrive in your mailbox with no questions asked. Appreciate that these same juices are mixed and shipped out diligently, with regard to quality and consistency and customer service, by hundreds of vendors, on the same type of desk on which you are currently operating your computer to view this thread. 

Appreciate your local B&amp;M - these will not exist (at least as they do now) one year from now. They just won't.

Appreciate the ability to thrive in this community without the oppression that makes itself so present in every other industry and product development as we know it.

Customer for life. ,188,24,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/15ncjv/ivape_is_refunding_my_stolen_order_customer_for/,"As seen in a recent post, my vapemail was stolen from my front lobby. The thieves even left the damned packaging in the trashcan. I returned from dinner after confirming delivery online to find my package (MVP, tank, juices, cartos...) empty and in the lobby trash can. Needless to say, I was pretty peeved, and posted a picture here. 

iVape is replacing everything, and only asking that I pay for the shipping. This is after I ordered my MVP from them because they were offering a discount because the makers of the device demanded that they raised the price... so iVape gave a discount *at a loss.*

iVape carries a great selection of mods, kits, juices, et cetera, and all I can say about their customer service is that in this most ridiculously shitty of situations they are going above and beyond to ensure that I don't get screwed. It would be well within their power and right to tell me to take it up with USPS, but instead, they're handling it personally and really reaching out.

ivapeguy, you're the jam on toast. 

**EDIT FOR TL;DR** some asshat opened my vapemail and stole the contents. iVape was in contact with me within a few hours, and are replacing everything. They are the jam on toast.

1359054838.0,155,self.electronic_cigarette,177ebd,Jet Cigs' take on the FDA,186,31,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/177ebd/jet_cigs_take_on_the_fda/,"Hi Guys,

Pat from Jet Cigs, a fairly small prefilleds company, here. We're not regular posters since we're in the prefilleds business, but we did [an AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/13viz5/iama_head_of_rd_and_manufacturing_at_a_prefilled/) a few months back. In light of the ""Response to the New FDA Announcement"" post, I wanted to speak off-the-cuff about the FDA for a bit.

The main thing I want to say is this: stop treating the FDA like they're ""the enemy."" I'm a small business owner whose business could easily be destroyed by the FDA's regulations, but I do my best to hold no animosity towards the organization. It's made up of people who, in all likelihood, care deeply about what they're doing. Yes, most of the unskilled government employees you meet when you have to ""deal with the government"" at the DMV or whatever are apathetic and surly, but the chemists, lawyers, and policy analysts at the FDA are skilled workers with a passion for what they do. (at worst, they're a little too ""ivory tower"" - not great at balancing industry needs against necessary regulation)

More importantly, antagonizing the FDA is not in our interest. **The fact is that ecig science is uncertain** - no one can credibly say ""ecigs are safe"" or ""ecigs are unsafe"" without significant equivocation. This is a very difficult state of science for the FDA to work with - they're used to looking at *very comprehensive* studies which follow a very rigid process when evaluating whether something should be regulated or not. Compound this with the fact that they've only been responsible for *tobacco products in general* since 2009, and have been given [a rather poorly crafted framework to do so](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Smoking_Prevention_and_Tobacco_Control_Act), and they're in a very difficult situation.

The bottom line is that the FDA is your ""enemy"" only because a) they're legally required to be, and b) because they don't want you to bitch to them if some unscrupulous moron uses diacetyl in a cut-price buttered popcorn flavor, or low-grade PG with diethylene glycol in their tobacco flavor, or shitty exploding batteries in their hardware.

The upshot of the uncertainty of ecig science is this: without comprehensive science and any ""smoking guns"" which would suggest ecigs are dangerous, the FDA has a lot more freedom to go with the tide of public opinion. And, despite Pfizer's best efforts, public opinion doesn't seem to be especially against ecigs. So you guys need to keep speaking up, as calmly and rationally as possible, explaining why ecigs should remain legal!

There's not much you can do at this point, because we're in the ""quiet period"" when the FDA has stopped accepting public comments until draft regulations are released. For now, patiently wait, and then **send the FDA feedback when the draft regulations come out**. The draft regulations aren't gonna go into effect for 3-24 months after they are released. (huge range, I know, but it's anyone's guess) In this time, if they ban DIY, flavors, high nicotine strengths, etc., it's up to *all of you guys* to convince them that their first draft needs some revisions. And you know what? Even if the preliminary regulations look bad, they might just come around to ""vapers' opinion"" if it's expressed in the right way.

TLDR: Stop bitching about the FDA. Instead, bombard them with *courteous* and *science-driven* feedback telling them why ecigs should be legal and sensibly regulated.

Edit: Just wanted to add that no, the FDA is not a perfect organization, and I hope none of you think that I think that it is. It's what we've got, the people who work there are human, and we've gotta try to work with it, though.

Wrong.

You can't stop a steam train that easy. 

Regulate juice manufacture. We'll DIY and juice vendors will adapt to selling just flavor blends with 0 nic for aroma therapy.

Regulate Hardware. I'll put a lightulb on the end of my device and sell you a swiss army flashlight, it can be used for lighting your house or aroma therapy!

Big Pharma says it's bad for you? Yeah, the internet says otherwise and everyone already hates you big pharm. We'll lose Grandma and Grandpa because they believe what they hear on the news but the rest of the world gets their news from twitter and facebook and reddit, not a problem. 

Government bans import of chinese products, we'll make our own products. 

Let me be clear, I don't think regulations are going to be that harsh or have that much of a 'real' negative impact on our industry, mostly because a lot of powerful folks are making money on it and there's no good way to spin ""vaping is bad for you"" when you've got an army of Doctors out there telling you otherwise. We WILL get hit but I feel it'll be minor and while it may effect some mom and pop e-juice vendors, in the long run the regulations I'm expecting will be mostly needed and perfectly reasonable. 

Even in the worst case where they call vaping just another form of smoking and say it's exactly the same as smoking, people will STILL switch. Hey, if I'm gonna die I might as well die with the taste of sweet sweet dead or alive ejoose on my tongue than the flavor of burned assholes and the stench of burning death on my clothes. Even if vaping WAS as bad as smoking, I'd still be vaping instead of smoking, I couldn't quit smoking before so I might as well do the 'other' thing that I enjoy. I mean... it's quite obviously NOT as bad as smoking, how much better is still being proven but it's pretty obvious that it's better for you :P It's cheaper unless you catch pokemon syndrome with vaping equipment and 'gotta catch em all'. 

Even if they get rid of online sales of nicotine, we'll work around it, hardware, we'll work around it. This isn't something that can be stopped anymore than any other thing that they people want access to. Vaping is too big now, they  missed their opportunity to crush it, we have activists and extremely vocal activists at that. We've got major businesses and an entire industry growing around it and supporting a small portion of the economy, creating jobs, generating tax revenue and helping people live longer. 

We're not going anywhere. Stay vigilant, don't just assume the bad bills won't pass, keep contacting your representatives and doing your part where you can but don't worry... the end is not nigh... for us.

1365798611.0,153,self.electronic_cigarette,1c89gn,A reminder about our priorities :),195,42,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1c89gn/a_reminder_about_our_priorities/,"I happily turned down the opportunity to pick up some crazy vaping gear, and you may want to, too, from time to time. Here's my story:


Having already filed my tax return, I was happy using some of the refund to finally get an eVIC, as well as stock up on juices and whatnot. 

Then I realized I had to amend my return, and I have an additional $800  coming my way! I was so excited! What a perfect time to grab an iHybrid and some other awesome vaping gear!

A day after I finished my return, my daughter came to visit (she lives with her mom). I have happily parented her right by getting her OBSESSED with Legos, much as I had been as a child. 

We were watching the news, and then a story on the new Legoland hotel came on. A thought occurred...

...I never got to go to Legoland as a kid, and we're only 3 hours away. Plus, I have that $800 dollars coming my way, which would really help with the price of the hotel.

I asked her if she wanted to go, and her eyes lit up. **Sold, right then and there!** Forget the iHybrid, forget the DIY kit, forget the Cirrus tanks and everything else. I want to take her to Legoland. I'm done being selfish for a while.

This may come off as a bit anti-consumerist, but I assure you it's not (I am going to Legoland, after all; a monument to overpriced plastic bricks):

I just wanted to remind you guys that it's not the things in our lives that bring us happiness, but the people and moments we share together. A big part of why we all started vaping is for our health; not because we care only about us, but the people that surround us. Our vaping is because we want to live, and it's important that we ask ourselves, ""live for what?""

It's easy to get wrapped up in buying ""the next big thing"", but it's important to keep it all in perspective. I want to only make a suggestion that before springing for a new device, maybe we can think of our family, our SOs, and our friends. Think of the opportunities we can have as non-smokers, things we can do, and places we can go. 

As much as I love this subreddit (and I do; I mean, 95% of my reddit activity is here), I'd like to encourage everyone that we can post more  about the opportunities we achieve as non-smokers. The ones I've seen that come to mind are [Mattogo's runway shoot](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1av2he/they_asked_me_if_i_could_smoke_an_analog_on_the/), [Reidoon's 2nd lease on life](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/17ix23/electronic_cigarettes_actually_changed_my_life/), [local_redditor's best training day yet](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1c2r6a/you_guys/), and [ThufirrHawat's new ride](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1a12lx/brought_to_you_by_electronic_cigarettes/).

We all like these posts, because it shows all of us the potential of what we can achieve without cigarettes. This subreddit is for all things e-cigs, and that includes things that it enables and empowers us to do.

I love you all, and I'm still up voting your vapemail pictures, but I just wanted to remind you that this is a community where we can show off our changed lifestyles due to vaping just as much as our devices.

The FDA has announced that it intends to propose ""deeming"" regulation by April 2013 (to apply Chapter IX of FSPTCA to e-cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, shisha/hookah and other tobacco products not currently subject to Chapter IX regulations) ""and to specifiy additional restrictions.""

What does this mean for you?

Sections 905 and 910 would ban all e-cigarettes, and other provisions of Chapter IX would also decimate the e-cigarette industry, protect cigarette markets and otherwise threaten public health.

If this action does not completely destroy the industry on it's own this would be the first step in an all out attack on your ability to use electronic cigarettes. A ban on internet sales and significant taxes would almost surely follow.

This is the most significant threat to our right to vape here in the US since electronic cigarettes were introduced.

What can you do?

1. Become a member of CASAA (The Consumer Advocates For Smoke-Free Alternatives Association) - http://casaa.org/Become_a_Member.html . CASAA is the voice of the vaping community at the numerous public hearings and meetings that have been held with the FDA.

2. Sign this petition - https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/prevent-fda-regulating-or-banning-sale-and-use-electronic-cigarettes-accessories-and-associated/RQLBYRsd

It will take 120 seconds to sign this petition. Currently we need over 18,000 more signatures to push this issue in front of the president.

I apologize for interrupting you with this email but we felt you had the right to know that your right to vape is under attack. If we don't stand up together and challenge the FDA on these issues we may lose this outstanding product for good.

I'm also a Redditor and decided this might be a good place to get some serious feedback. Also, I will answer questions to the best of my ability!

EDIT: Ok, wow, this blew up. Hello everyone! I see that most of the questions and comments are regarding the eVic. The biggest concern seems to be the low voltage/wattage ceiling. While this ceiling is based on your atomizer, from what I've seen on youtube and the comments here, that ceiling is too low, and using an atomizer with a different resistance actually moves the ceiling in the opposite direction than what is preferable. I will talk try to have someone talk our engineering branch about this (I don't actually speak Chinese; I'm American).

We are currently revamping our software UI, but it doesn't change too many options currently available with the MVR. I think open source is an AWESOME idea, and I will talk to my manager about it, but I think one issue with that is setting the V/W ceiling manually might burn out an atomizer and the company might think that's a liability.

The next version of the eVic, the eVic-S, isn't so much a newer model as it as a different version of the current eVic. I don't know very much about it right now, but I do know that it is thinner and more durable than the current eVic, and is without the LCD screen (it's controlled either with the software or with button clicks to change the V/W.) I'm not sure, but I think the thinning down of the model is changing the head and body threads. I will have more on this later.

As I just started at the company, and am completely new to e-cigs, I know next-to-nothing about mod kits. I should check out some beginner posts here and get learned.

I love the feedback so far, and when I have the time, I'll be answering questions and commenting on more feedback.

I've never smoked in my life, and never would have imagined owning one of these things. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me officially start by saying that I have severe panic disorder that is now entering into Agoraphobia. I've had it for as long as I can remember, and it only became worse with the discovery of a brain mass in August 2012. Since then my anxiety has made me pass out several times. I'd wake up in the middle of the night and panic horribly.

Anyway, going out is hard now. I've went out a couple of times where I thought I'd pass out right then and there, and as you can imagine, that's very scary. 

So my friend had a Vaporizer when I went over his house one day. I had no idea why since he doesn't smoke. When he told me that it has no tobacco, I figured I'd give it a try. The more I used it, the more I felt calm. It's like when someone smokes a Cigarette to calm down, it isn't just the Nicotine or whatever that calms them down, it's the breathing. My anxiety has caused me to be a shallow breather and it only makes things worse. The e-cig helps for me to practice my breathing and I get a neat peach flavor for it :). 

There was one instance where I was very close to passing out recently. I used my e-cig to do my breathing and I beat it. I never leave home without it and I'm very grateful to have it. 

EDIT: I just want to add that I'm using 0mg juices which to my knowledge means there's no Nicotine in it.

It was either one of two things. 

1. You made a throw away account because you were afraid of saying something bad about a vendor with a decent rep here and getting flamed. 

2. You're a troll and/or butthurt vendor (I've gotten hatemail...) 


I'm gonna go with 1. 

You quoted the policy on my site about warranty. That's there to make the CC processor smile, ask anyone who's ever dealt with me. I take care of my customers. I knew as soon as I got in bed with china that I""d have DOAs, stuff that breaks a week after receipt, etc. I don't even ask questions, if it didn't work as long as I feel it should work, I replace it, exchange it, or refund it. I've never declined a customer even when it was obviously their fault... 

As an example, I had one lady contact me. her twist never worked! She said her son came over and ""took off the top to see what was wrong"" and it had broken wires inside! Well.. yeah, you rip the top off a twist that happens. 

Every twist I sell, I 5click it on, then 5 click it off before I send it. I asked her if she had tried to turn it on, she told me it didn't have any buttons except the fire button... it was probably just off. I replaced it. 

I sent out 4 packages today to take care of customers, one guy it wasn't even a matter of broken goods, he ordered one wire in haste, meant to order another, asked if I could exchange it, I just sent him the new wire. I'm not sayin I make a habit of giving out free stuff (don't ask for free stuff people :P ) but I take care of my customers on a case by case basis and I've only ever had one person remain unhappy with me after the encounter and that person just couldn't be pleased. 

Like I said, I'm going to make assumption #1 and assume you're not trolling and that you used the throw away account to protect your own account. 

Contact me via the ""Contact us"" section of my website, put your order number in the comment and a valid email address, I'll contact you and we'll get it taken care of. 

In the future... not just with me, but any vendor. Contact them before you assume you're getting screwed, most of us are pretty nice folk who are in business to get people vaping, not just to make money.

Now. this was chain vaping to the 2x 18650 + 2x 18350, 30ml juice degree.    
I either had a bottle of cruel liquor or a drip tip in my mouth at any given time.  
Where am I going with this?  
to the window, to the wall, then the floor, then the morning... oh god the morning.  
I felt like I had been spit roasted by 2 Sahara seahorses.  
I was One Eyed Willies skeleton doing lines of sulfur on Salar de Uyuni.  
I was one of those sad bastards in cocoon in the ballsacks in the bottom of the pool.      
You know how everyone say's ""drink plenty of water while consuming alcohol""? yeah, yeah what ever, no one cares right?  
Well, if you're going to be vaping, take heed, and double said water consumption.  
For the love of organ function, take heed.

On Friday I was stood in the Smoking area at work when I noticed another guy stood there using a device that had a small tank of liquid on it and he was blowing out plumbs of smoke!  I was mesmerised by what this guy was doing and i instantly needed to know more. I tried to listen to a conversation he was having and the only bit I clearly heard was ""E-Go"".

As soon as I got home I made a cup of coffee, sat down at my computer and typed the 3 letters into google that were about to send me on what could be a life changing journey: e. g. o.

i don't think I moved from my chair for about 5 hours as I was suddenly plunged in to a whole world of ecigs and vaping, I couldn't take my eyes off it.  

First thing on Saturday morning I headed to my nearest B&amp;M store and left with an Ego Twist,  2 T3's, a couple of blank cartos and 4 flavours of e-juice. 

I can't believe what can be quite an intimidating topic to make sense of also has such an amazing online community that can help. I've read hundreds of threads on places like ECF, UK vapours and Planet of the vapes and hours and hours of You Tube videos (Pbursado, what a legend!). 

In less than 4 days I've gone from not even knowing this even existed to setting myself up with a bit of a starter kit and moved on to just having ordered my first mechanical mod!

1365971912.0,141,self.electronic_cigarette,1ccfab,New subreddit rules regarding vape mail and memes.,208,67,283,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1ccfab/new_subreddit_rules_regarding_vape_mail_and_memes/,"**tl;dr: Vape mail for common items must be posted in designated daily vape mail threads starting tomorrow.**

An abundance of imagery on any subreddit can be detrimental for those who prefer reddit to serve as a community driven filter for news, info and discussion for any particular subject. Pictures are easily digestible and so are easy to vote up. They can therefor drown out other more ambitious content. All too often I have seen many posts in which the user has put effort fall by the wayside while imagery of often quite ordinary items submitted around the same time come out on top. Links to news and information suffer too.

reddit's original intended purpose was as a link aggregator – a 'best of' for the internet. That's the reddit I joined. Self posts and even comments were introduced later. When they then introduced subreddits to separate content, I grew this subreddit by filtering the forums and posting links to only the most relevant news, info and developments relating to e-cigs. I actually remember not long ago, someone posted a link to an informative post on ecf and worried whether it it was allowed here. I was surprised they didn't know that's was the point of reddit. We link to everything. If you are reading another e-cig related site and you see something interesting, link to it. 

This subreddit also became a resource for help and support, especially for beginners but this was a consequence of having an e-cig subreddit not it's primary purpose. At one point the biggest complaint this subreddit received was that there were too many questions from beginners and I think the changes I implemented helped alleviate that problem. I'd like this subreddit to continue being somewhere friendly where beginners can get information and advice while also catering to more advanced users. 

These days pictures are a dominant force on a lot of subreddits who haven't done something to curb them. I think the proliferation of smart phones and easy image hosts are a big part of the reason they became so dominant. A lot of drama can arise on subreddits which have attempted to curb image posts and I'm hoping the rules I implement are soft enough not to cause a furore. I don't want to remove images completely from the subreddit obviously. A lot of images can be beneficial and informative so it is difficult to decide on rules that won't choke the subreddit either.

*****

So here's what I'm going to do for now (and all this is experimental and subject to change/adjustment):

From now on Vape Mail must be posted in designated Daily Vape Mail threads. These threads will commence each day at midnight, Pacific Standard Time and run for 24 hours. These will be for posting images of any common e-cig related merchandise you have purchased. Pictures of order receipts and tracking details are also only be posted in these threads. 

Pictures of unusual, unique or uncommon e-cig related merchandise **may be posted outside** of these threads. This would include pictures of new items for example which aren't common yet.

To find each day's daily vape mail thread if it's not readily apparent you can click the menu button in the header and select 'vape mail' and you should be able to more easily find it. This will bring you to all the latest posts tagged with the 'vape mail' flair.

Memes and 'my face when' type posts can no longer be posted here. I originally allowed these because we don't get that many but I think removing them sets a tone as to the kind of content I'd prefer.

Recently I've noticed more and more people posting pictures of themselves using their e-cigs whether it is in their car or at work or in the armchair watching tv. I can see these becoming a problem too. I'm considering asking for the more ordinary ones be posted in the daily vape mail threads but I'm not sure if they fit. 

I'll leave them be for now. I'm considering calling the thread the 'Daily Vape Pics round-up thread' and giving these dailys their own separate flair. Vape mail was never a good name in the first place because you may buy your gear in B&amp;Ms but that's what caught on. 

The first daily vape mail thread will start tomorrow at midnight PST.

Here's a negative one, Juicy Vapor has shitty customer service.",184,43,200,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/14bgoh/so_many_positive_reviews_of_vendors_lately_heres/,"So right around Black Friday I received this coupon from [Juicy Vapor](http://www.juicyvapor.com/) for [free first class shipping](http://i.imgur.com/RuDfs.jpg). I passed on sales upto 30% off at Juicy Vapor this summer, but this was too good to pass up as the cheapest shipping option from Juicy Vapor to Canada is **$17 for Priority Mail**. I've always wanted to try their Ecto Plasma.

I put a bottle of Ecto Plasma in the cart and at checkout I chose free first class shipping as the shipping method. The order went through and my card was charged.

Two days later I receive an email from Tyler at Juicy Vapor saying there was a glitch on the system and the coupon code should not have worked. I have to pay for shipping.

According to their TOS they are not responsible for mishaps like this and if I wanted the bottle I had to pay for the shipping. The other alternative was a refund and I eventually took it.

Here are my gripes with that:

* The vaping community is one of the most kindest and most generous I've ever come across. Look at this community for example, everybody is eager to help the newbies to get started. 

    We have instances where vendors like iVape sends a broke guy free juice. We have Indigo Vapor who contacted customers after they had received their juice and offered to replace it because it was not up to their standards. Vape Dudes upsized every order because their processing time was slow. **Those mentioned above and in many other occasions we have vendors who went above and beyond the call of duty**. They bore the cost of their mistake and even when it wasn't a mistake they still ensured the customer received very good service.

    That's the kind of ecosystem I'd like to see vaping become a part of. **Juicy Vapor seems to be all about the money** and not so much about helping people. 

    They charge $4 for processing orders and their juice is one of the most expansive out there at $21 per 30ml. **They are a big vendor charging premium prices while providing less of a customer support than what the little guys are offering.** 

    **This is not the kind of business I want to support, no matter how good their juice are.** 

* ***At no point in our conversation did they offer to discount the price of the juice I ordered and nor did they offer to split the shipping cost with me since the mistake was on their end.*** It was simply I either pay them the full price of juice + full price of shipping or a refund. I don't know much about cost of a bottle of juice, but I'm willing to bet they'd still make a profit paying $13 for shipping + $4 for handling while selling me a juice for $25.

They could have gotten a potential new regular, but instead they've got a person who'd never again order from them nor recommend anyone to.

I try to share as much accurate information as I can in as many places as I can but I'm a busy man... there are a lot of other folks that share good, quality information on social networks as well but....

There are a HUGE number of misinformed individuals who perpetuate that misinformation throughout the interwebs. 

If you're messing with batteries, do research. Not on a forum, not on a subreddit, like... look up REAL info from a respectable source. 

baterry university is one spot for that. 

If you're messing with a new material, silica, xc-116 wick, SS rope, SS mesh, kanthal, nichrome, etc... research the product. These things are made by some one and theres a sheet out there with a LOT of info on anything you can imagine. 

A couple of examples:

SS Mesh, do you know what type of SS your mesh is made of? 304, 306, 316? Do you know the differences? 

Silica vs Fiberglass, do you know that some people use those names interchangeably and it's accurate? Do you know which ones are 'safer' than others? 

XC-116, did you read that torching a piece of XC for 5 minutes will ""Treat"" it? It doesn't. It cleans it to remove the dangerous off gasses and sizing materials but it doesn't ""Treat"" it or make it more durable. Theres a spec sheet for that... 

Another thing that concerns me is the trend towards ""mechanical mods"" and ""Low ohm omgvaporclouds"" coils. I'm not sayin it's dangerous but it can be if you don't know what you're doing. Dangerous to your health or your wallet. 

If you run a non LiMn or otehr ""IMR"" style battery beyond it's capability you can fry it, that costs you money. You can fry it bad to the point that it goes into a catastrophic failure which can cost you some skin. There are 'safe' ways to do this stuff but going in blind is bad news, especially when you pick up random chunks of information and piece together the picture on your own if you have no background in this sort of thing (electronics, mechanical function, material sciences, etc). 

I wish I had time to sit down and take all of the information i've gathered over the last couple of years and put it in one spot in various guides but I don't at the moment. It's on my list of things to do but in the mean time... 

Please, educate yourself, make a point to go look up information. Don't ask a question here and just take what you get as gospel, not even from me or slumberland, or any of the other folks that are sorta 'known' sources for information. Educate yourself, it's your wallet, its your health that's at risk if you do something blind. 

I'm going to do a weekly QA thread over on /r/steammonkey/ every friday starting tomorrow. I'll put a particular topic in the post header and that's what we'll talk about. I'll share what information I have as well as sources for that info and I'll try to get some folks that are knowledgeable about subjects I'm not or just to get a second set of eyes. 

I invite you, if you KNOW what you're talking about to participate in these, share information here and answer questions. If you need answers, ask but please, go out and try to find that info yourself as well. 

This isn't just about your personal health and finances, it's also about the community and industry as a whole. It only takes 1 good story to make the news to create a panic about the dangers of vaporizers, don't be that story.

1373565397.0,138,self.electronic_cigarette,1i3ffm,OP Delivers!! Emailed research doctors and got response.,160,22,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1i3ffm/op_delivers_emailed_research_doctors_and_got/,"Some time ago I commented on a users thread stating that I would contact some of the research doctors at my University and inquire about research relating to the types of ""e-cigs"" most of us use. I got a response last week and finally got around to posting it. Below I have copy pasted the email chain and a link to the publication I was emailed will be at the bottom.

Dr. Eissenburg,

Good afternoon, my name is Nathaniel Smith I am currently a student here at VCU majoring in chemistry. I have been searching for faculty involved in electronic cigarette studies, as a result, I came across you in the directory and decided to shoot you an email. First, I hope this email reaches you in good health and I apologize if this email comes at a bad time or if it is better suited for another department or faculty member.

I have been reading through studies that have been conducted during the last few years and they all had two things in common. The studies were inconclusive as to whether or not e-cigs can lead to smoking cessation and questioned the method of delivery. I am sure that you are aware that electronic nicotine delivery devices are becoming increasing more popular especially with big tobacco looking to keep up with the trending population. I am writing because I believe the studies lacked several key elements and I am curious as to whether or not any studies are currently underway. 

The biggest fault with the e-cig studies was delivery method. The ""cig-a-like"" variations that can be purchased at gas stations and retail stores are extremely unreliable, unpleasant and are not efficient enough to deliver enough nicotine to curb most cravings. Thus, they fail at being a reliable cessation option. I say this because I have successfully quit smoking tobacco using e-cigs also referred to as personal vaporizers (PV). When I started with PV's like blu, I was quickly turned off. The taste alone was enough to make me never want to pick it up again. At this point I was smoking 3-4 hookah's a day and needed to stop entirely. I was introduced to a personal vaporizer system unlike anything being sold in most retail stores. The device I received allowed me to choose from endless flavors, battery sizes, atomizers and nicotine strength. All of these variations are of equal importance. Being able to choose a flavor like ""Honey Peary,"" a honeydew melon, pear and strawberry blend, customize its nicotine strength and vaporize with a completely custom PV, made the experience not only more than pleasurable, but also allowed me to literally step down from 18mg of nicotine (.18% per mL) to 0mg in one month. The nicotine solution (juice) is made of propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (pg/vg), and can be purchased in several ratios the most common  being a 50/50 blend. However, these ratios can be customized upon order to increase or decrease the amount of vapor and throat hit. The later being a major element that smokers enjoy. 

So what am I saying? Smoking as you very well know, is as much a chemical addiction as it is as a psychological addiction. The problem with PV's like blu is that the primary focus is on the chemical addiction and the psychological element is an after thought. In order to successfully treat smokers you have to give them ""skin in the game,"" and the cessation method must be something that they enjoy. Many vaper's, (PV users) have a prefered juice flavor, nicotine strength, pg/vg ratio and delivery device. All that I have come into contact with, this number being in the hundreds and possible thousands have successfully quit smoking. Many haven't touched a cigarette since day one of using their PV. 

I have included in this email a link to a photo album of my PV's and juice on imgur, as well as links to sever resources I use for equipment, juice and information. I would like to see research utilizing the things I have described above and be involved a study if one of this nature has not been done yet. I look forward to hearing from you. Have a great day.

Dear Nate:

Thanks for your informative e-mail.  I agree very much with the points you raise, and that is one reason why I have published a study in which experienced ECIG users brought in their own ECIGs and used their preferred flavor/strength of liquid (see attached).

There is a lot of work to do if we are to understand these products and their effects!

Thanks again,

Tom E.

I usually have a different one each day switching between my Vamo, Lavatubes, and mechanicals and then whatever I have sitting on top of it.  I try to get their attention because all of them are smokers.  I always bring a little baggy of new tips in with me just in case someone asks to try it.  Tonight, I was finally propositioned.

This particular fellow was curious because he absolutely loved the smell of my Honey Pearry.  I told him that if he really wanted to try it, he was more than welcome to.  I grabbed him out a fresh tip, handed him my new K100 with a .7 ohm coil in my AGA T2 and let him go to town.  After a few brief moments he was completely floored.  He ended up hanging out with me for about 2 hours after he clocked out and I went through a breakdown of my entire portable kit I carry in my car with me.  I built a dual coil in my Vision Eternity to show him how easy it was to rebuild and then let him try it again on my Lavatube 2.0.  The constant look of shock and awe on his face told me everything.  Sadly, the kid only makes minimum wage and works like 30 hours a week supporting himself and his girlfriend.  I told him about the benefits of switching and the cost effectiveness and that also piqued his interest.  But, I know what it's like when money is tight and I knew there was probably no chance this guy would ever take the plunge and buy a new kit for himself.  So, I reached into my grab bag.  I set him up with a Tube Tank DCT, my eGo-V w/charging cable, and topped him off with some good ol' charlie flavored tobacco juice (he was a Pall Mall fan).  Within seconds, his face lit up like a kid on Christmas and he spent the last 30 minutes of his visit with me just chain vaping and making ridiculous clouds of vape on his new toy.  Right before he left, he pitched the last of his Pall Mall cigarettes into the trash bin and waved goodbye to me while puffing on his new apv.

It was hard letting go of my cheap emergency backup.  But it was so easy knowing that I may have very well saved someone's life.  This was a wholesome experience for me that I'll never forget.  (And yes, it's my first time letting go of one of my preciouseses...but totally worth it)

Tomorrow I'll be bring him in a full bottle of some more Ol' Charlie juice and a sample of the Honey Pearry (the 30ml's are MINE I TELL YOU....MIIIIIINE).  I'll try to get a picture of him vaping with it and I'll post it here, so come back tomorrow around this time and I'll have a link for you guys :)",,False,self,t5_2qmlu,False,,current,True,t3_1dbqju,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1dbqju/with_a_heavy_heart_i_said_goodbye_to_my_egov_and/,

I have been alerted to several issues with our company dealing with orders and or/ communication. I'd like to address these.

In October/November, we had an absolute onslaught of orders. We are a 2 person company, with a 3rd general helper. Chris makes all of our ejuice by hand, bottle by bottle - no batches. I do all of the customer service, order fulfillment and online items. So, when we got slammed with orders, we got behind. We didn't know what to do - close? Wouldn't that short change people that wanted to order? We kept trying to keep up - working 16 hours a day, 7 days a week. Finally, we decided to close to focus on all outstanding orders and to reset. We did this because we care deeply about our business and our customers. 

So, we reopened and have maintained much faster shipping - most orders ship next day right now.

However, we are still feeling a little ripple from the time when we were ""backed up"". This WILL be resolved. I can promise that no-one is being intentionally ignored. We will not leave anyone in the lurch. Our intentions are to give the best juice to our customers. We do care. 

So that being said, please, if you have any issues feel free to message me here. My promise to you is to resolve everything - leave no one behind. 

I want to officially apologize for the lack in timely communication. This is 100% my fault. My promise to YOU, our customers, is to improve - to not have this happen again. I will close all gaps and I will not let you down.

I realize that we've lost some of you. We respect this. We understand. I understand. 

From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank those that have weathered the growing pains with us. Thank you for your support.

* If you've made a recommendation in a previous thread like this and you still think it is a good one or if you have seen one you have liked recently, you're welcome to copy&amp;paste it into this thread.

* New vapers, if you have recently started vaping and think you have found a good set-up to start with, I encourage you to recommend it though if you have only had it less than a couple weeks, maybe you should wait to see how it holds up.

Vaping is all about finding what YOU enjoy. If you are satisfied with a cig-a-like, that is fine. The point of this post is to get you started so that you can get on the road to trying and comparing devices and juices until you find what works best for you. 

___________________________

After another AskReddit thread with mentions of /r/electronic_cigarette, I see we seem to have another influx of newer folk who are looking to get into vaping. Several of them are posting threads asking for help, and a lot of the advice people are giving is generally the same. So I figured it might be a good idea to create a thread to help them out. We already have a few starter guide threads, but it seems like most of them are a bit ""outdated"". So here we go, this is my attempt at one.

Quick note beforehand - These are my own recommendations. If anyone has any more, please post them below. All are welcome. If anyone looking to join the community has any questions, ask below as well. We're all happy to answer questions here. Also, I am *not* advertising any specific vendors other than one or two that carry said kit exclusively. If you do some googling, you could probably find what I'm linking at a much cheaper price.

**CIG-A-LIKE KIT**

So, you see all these electronic cigarettes at gas stations. Maybe Blu rings a bell. These small, ""stick batteries"" are often referred to as *cig-a-likes* because they are very similar to a cigarette in appearance and (sometimes) performance. Many of these flat out *suck*. If you are adamant on getting a cig-a-like kit, I would recommend the [Panda Evolve Starter Kit](http://www.pandaecigs.com/Panda-Evolve-Kit-p/evolvekit.htm). It has (from what I have seen and heard) the best performance you're going to get out of a cig-a-like battery. It comes with two ""micromizers"" (small clearomizers. We'll discuss these in a moment) that hold/vaporize your juice for you. I recommend grabbing a few more of these as two probably won't last you all that long. I've also heard that their juice is very.. ""meh"". Just average. Try it and by all means, if you like it, keep using it. But if you get some and aren't a fan, there is a *lot* of other juice out there to try. Don't get discouraged.

Almost forgot - This battery is AUTOMATIC. This means you puff on it and it fires for you. Just put it in your mouth and ""smoke"" it. The majority of other devices are manual, meaning you have to press a button to fire it. Many new people think automatic batteries sound vastly superior, but they have their ups and downs for sure. I personally prefer manual batteries but keep an automatic for when I want to puff away, hands free.

**THE EGO**

The eGo is what most would consider the next step up from a cig-a-like battery, and the step before a ""mod"". It is larger (cigar-sized+), has much better battery life, better performance, and can use many more *omizers (again, we'll talk about those in a moment). Some even have variable voltage. VV devices allow you to adjust how much power is going through your coil, allowing you to find a sweet spot for each juice and *omizer you use. [Here is an eGo C Twist](http://ivape.net/index.php/1000mAh-Joye-eGo-C-Twist-White.html). This is 1000mAh (battery capacity) and has a dial on the bottom allowing you to adjust your voltage from 3.2 to 4.8. [Here is a Vision Spinner](http://www.myvaporstore.com/Vision_Spinner_VV_eGo_Battery_1300mAh_p/vs-s1300.htm). It has 1300mAh and many prefer the dial on it over the Twist. Up to you, really.

**FLASHLIGHTS**

Time for mods! The first set of mods were originally created by vapers out of flashlights, adding a 510 connection so that people could put in large capacity batteries and vape away for days. Today, mods aren't made out of flashlights. They're machined for their purpose. There are *LOADS* of mods out there. Eventually you'll own a lot more than you might expect to. However, if you want a mod right off the start, my personal recommendation would be the [Vamo](http://www.okcvapes.com/vamo-variable-wattage-voltage/). OKCVapes is not the cheapest place for a Vamo, BUT it is one of the only places that allow you to make a kit with your Vamo. Much easier for new vapers. The Vamo uses 18650 batteries (high mAh, one will last at least an entire day. More if you vape less than me, which is likely), has variable voltage AND variable wattage, and is generally great. It'll last you a good amount of time. I used to think that mods weren't something you should recommend to a new vaper, but when my friend wanted to get into vaping, I had him get a Vamo kit and some cartomizers and he's loving it and having no issues. Another recommendation would be the [iTaste MVP](http://www.smoktek.com/Innokin-iTaste-MVP-2600mAh-Box-APV-Kit_p_544.html). Yes, it is a box. Yes, that probably seems weird to you. But it is GREAT, trust me! Fully charged battery lasts two or three days from all the tales I've heard, and it comes with two iClear 16 clearomizers, which are great!

**OMIZERS**

*Omizers! Woo! This is gonna be fun. This refers to atomizers, cartomizers, clearomizers, micromizers, cartomizer tanks, etc etc etc etc. There are a lot of these. For a better explanation of all of these, [SteamMonkey did a great thread on them](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1dshxl/monkey_university_562013_clearos_and_cartos_and/). 

So, my recommendations.

eGo Style Clearo - These only fit on an eGo or eGo threaded device because of the ""skirt"" at the bottom. I would recommend the [iClear 16](http://www.vapingme.com/iclear-16-4-wick-dual-coil-1-6ml-clearomizer-ce5-colors/) or the [Kanger EVOD](http://www.myvaporstore.com/Kanger_EVOD_eGO_Bottom_Coil_Clearomizer_p/krev.htm). The iClear is dual coil with four wicks. This is good. However, I've personally had meh-tier performance from them for whatever reason. I personally prefer the EVOD. They look cool and they perform very well because they are a bottom coil clearomizer. The coil is at the bottom rather than the top, meaning no dry hits that plague many clearomizers when they get low on juice. They work great.

Regular clearo - I'm not a huge fan of clearos. However, the [iClear 30](http://www.discountvapers.com/innokin-iclear-30-clearomizer-tank-dual-coil/) and the [Kanger Protank](http://www.discountvapers.com/kanger-protank/) are the best I've used. This is pretty much the same as the EVOD vs the iClear 16. Top coil vs bottom coil. However, the added bonus here is that the Protank is glass. 

Don't forget that all the clearomizers I've mentioned up there have replaceable heads. This makes swapping flavors easy and anytime the head in there now gets old and burned up, you can switch it out easy. Very nice. I recommend having a few clearomizers and sets of heads at a time if you really like them.

Carto - VaporBeast has [15 great quality cartos for a great price](http://www.vaporbeast.com/15_Boge_Carto_Steal_p/bc15.htm). This is all I recommend. Others will recommend other cartos, but this is my only one. I've tried many cartos and these are the standard by which I judge those cartos. A+++.

Atomizer - These are for dripping. This is the best flavor and vapor you'll get out of the things I listed. However, it is a lot less convenient. You'll be dripping a few drops, vaping a few times, dripping, vaping, so on and so on and so on. I always keep a good atomiezr around for testing flavors before I fill up a clearo or something with them. If you want a high quality, great performance atty, try out the [HH357 Long Barrel](http://www.avidvaper.com/hh-357-long-barrel-hybrid-510-atomizer/). It is a great atomizer but it is a bit more expensive. However, it will last a long time. If you want a cheaper atomizer to use, EmpireMods has [a great bridgeless atty](http://www.empiremods.com/product_p/brdg5105.htm). 

**JUICESSSSSS**

This is a though one. There are so many juices out there. However, I'm just going to recommend the vendors I have consistently ordered from that have really come through. 

But first - TASTE IS SUBJECTIVE. One juice that tastes incredible to someone else may taste like hell to you. Try many juices. Don't just stick to what people tell you to try. 

[MountBakerVapor](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/) - These guys are great to start with. They're the cheapest prices on juice you'll find anywhere. There are loads of flavors to try and because they're so cheap, it is a great starting point to figure out what sorts of flavor profiles you like with your juice. They also have great service and super fast shipping times. They're great all around.

[TastyVapor](http://www.tastyvapor.us/) - You won't see these guys mentioned here much. This is the first vendor I ordered juice from and I actually ordered exclusively from them for nearly a full year. They're great. They have fantastic customer service and great flavors. What you order is what you get. You want Ultimate Vanilla? You can be damn sure that what you get is ""Ultimate Vanilla"", not some ""I think its vanilla but.. meh.."" bullshit. They also have a neat feature. They offer huge bottles of juices with 0 nic for cheap. Buy one of those, buy a high nic bottle of juice, and mix them together to your nic level. Bam! Loads of juice for cheap.

[The Vapor Chef](http://thevaporchef.com/) - Ugh. TVC is considered ""gourmet juice"". This stuff is fantastic and every flavor I've tried from him has been perfection. Honey Pearry is hugely popular here and I'd recommend it. However, give the cheaper options a try first to figure out what sorts of juices you ilke. Going to TVC right off the bat and ordering a bunch of tobacco flavors is not a good idea.

I mean, as far as ""pools"" of people, you guys make up a pretty significant slice. 

If you follow me you probably know I work a day job as well as run the store. I planned on the store being my full time thing one day but I always expected it to take a year or more to get there. Right nwo it looks like it might. 

This is sort of a personal rant/narrative about my journey so far as a vendor which may be completely boring to most of you so here's teh TLDR in advance :p 

I want this to be my full time job NOW not in a year, banks suck :) 


Now for the ~~masochistic~~ interested people...

I started planning this store completely different. Initially it was called Redbeards Locker and it was going to be a mod consignment shop and retail outlet for my personal designs. I've been working on a mech mod, DNA12 (back then) device, a RBC (rebuildable cartomizer), RBA, bottom feeder and a juice carrier. I spent months working on my designs, sunk a bunch of money into trying to prototype and make them myself and eventually ran into a financial brick wall.

My initial goals were to start an american made store with all american made products and I was failing because I just couldn't fund the prototyping of these devices and to get the quality I wanted out of them they just couldn't be made in my home shop on my little ghetto CNC and lathe. I was bitchin about it one night with my inlaws when they said ""Just sell the chinese crap until you make enough money to build your american stuff."" I sorta had a head slapping moment... why not?

So I knew right away that I wasn't going to carry anything I wouldn't use myself or recommend to friends/family members but I also knew I was limited in scope on what I had used. I was a carto tank guy who liked to futz around with RBAs. What about these vivi novas and T3s and other random doodads that all the kids were talkin about? So I bought up a bunch of crap, started talking to china every  night and saved up 5 grand of 'blow money' to start things.

I was playing around one night with Gimp2 trying to make a logo for Redbeards Locker and decided I looked sorta monkey like IRL so why not make a money with goggles and a big beard... I couldn't get the beard right but the monkey looked pretty cool. I saw him and just out of no where Steam Monkey came to mind, steam punk monkey, vapor is steam of a sort... time to change the business name! 

I registered Steam Monkey and negotiated for a couple of months with various vendors. Bought about 3k in stuff (the other 2k went to business registration, equipment and shipping materials) and i opened my doors at the end of November. 

That's when shit got real... I was anticipating it taking months to get even enough business to keep myself busy. I marketed, posted on all the various social networks, ran contests, etc. Suddenly I couldn't keep crap on the shelves. Due to my prices and all the extra stuff I throw into every order, my RBA goody bags, expensive (relatively) packaging to ensure everyone gets what they ordered intact and unmolested, I was never really able to flip orders from china fast enough to NOT be out of stock on crap. 

I've been growing but it's slow. I could trim some 'fat' so to speak in different places which would let me grow faster but I just can't do it. Things like the indestructo mailers I use and fortune cookies and goodie bags are just part of what Steam Monkey is, I can't be in business if I can't be in business the way I am so... it's slow growing. 

I'm going through the motions of putting some formal loan proposals in front of lenders to try and get a chunk of change to get ahead of the curve and push harder on my development of new products, I'm trying to get AHEAD of the game instead of playing catch up all the time but it's so slow and I want this shit NOW. Every hour I'm at my day job I'm thinking about SM and what I can do to improve my processes or my customers experiences, what products I shoudl pick up or drop, etc. I've officially checked out of my day job but I still go, do my work and come home like the good little corporate cog I am. I just don't wanna do it anymore. 

I want my life to be serving the vaping community, for the first time in my life I'm making money in a way that makes me feel good about myself and by doing things I actually enjoy (call me crazy but I love packing your boxes). 

best of all... I've got an awesome community of folks to service... I mean, vapers are almost universally awesome. Sure, theres some schmucks out there but for the most part vapers tend to be helpful and engaged, more civil than most internet communities, and pretty damn good at self regulating. It's weird... lol.

Like I said at the beginning, sort of a personal rant but I wanted to dump it somewhere and I figured at least a couple folks might care what's going on in the head of the person behind the monkey. 

Luv ya as always Reddit, thanks for helping get me to a place where all I want to do is climb further. You've been a major contributor to what I now consider a new direction in my life and my happiness and it really does mean a lot as corny as it might sound.

I notice it makes me feel anxious and restless, as well as dizzy at times. I'm using 18mg, and have been for a long time now. I don't chain vape, so it's not like I'm accidentally overdosing myself.

So, I thought maybe I was just hungry and that's why I've been having restlessness. I take Adderall for my ADHD so it suppresses the appetite, so I thought maybe my body needed food and I just didn't know it. I ate a burger, and noticed I still felt rather crappy. 

I never felt this way with vaping before, so what changed?

Well, Adderall is a high-grade stimulant, and as many of us know, stimulants (such as caffeine, nicotine) cause dehydration by nature. Coupled with the fact that PG and VG dehydrate, I decided to slam back a few bottles of water.

I instantly noticed a change. I felt better, relaxed, and generally an all-around good feeling again.

It's vital that you keep hydrated, especially when vaping. You may not exactly feel thirsty all the time, but dehydration can cause a lot of problems and you can get very ill from not being hydrated enough.

I know this is a common thing in the vaping world, but it sometimes slips up on you like it did for me. I'm back to carrying around a quart of water in my bag, and I've felt a lot better lately.",,False,self,t5_2qmlu,False,,,True,t3_1e07r3,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1e07r3/reminder_keep_hydrated/,

I think this is a great community - everyone is very helpful and thousands of life-years have been saved by people switching over to electronic cigarettes.

That being said, this forum has become overrun with a slurry of the same posts over and over. For example:

* pictures of people's setups - some of which are pretty cool, but a lot of which are pretty basic. I understand people get excited, but either way.

* pictures of ""where I vaped today"", some of which are just someone vaping on their patio

* I'm vaping and drinking a beer - here's a picture!

* image memes

* pictures of juice collections

* pictures of vapemail

* ""I love _____ juice! Just wanted to tell everyone!""

* I glued my pen to my ecig, now I can multitask!

I'm not commenting on the quality of these posts and I hope no one takes offense to my list. However, I think we have grown enough to the point where these types of posts might warrant a new subreddit. Maybe something like /r/vapeporn? or /r/vapesetups?

IMO, this subreddit's current and future subscribers could benefit greatly from having more real/pertinent/beneficial content on the front page that could improve their vaping experience. Information such as vendor/product reviews, tips for vaping, guides, etc. As it stands, looking for real info takes a fair amount of digging.

Let the downvotes commence if you guys feel differently. I just had to get this off my chest because as time goes on I find myself visiting this subreddit less and less.

1369076145.0,126,self.electronic_cigarette,1epl4o,VaporRater's Guide to Dripping (WARNING: Wall of text doesn't even begin to cover it),148,22,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1epl4o/vaporraters_guide_to_dripping_warning_wall_of/,"With the recent influx of subscribers, I thought it was about time we discussed dripping, the (almost) original way to vape.

Back when I began vaping, we searched high and low for material to fill our cartridges (that's right, cartridges). We tried new polyfill, lipton pyramid tea bags, and blue aquarium foam (oh, the memories!), among other random items. As it turned out, many of us ended up skipping the filler altogether and dripping straight into our atomizers...thus direct dripping was born.

Compared to today's PVs and *-omizers, the technology was only in it's infancy, but as it turns out, when it comes to the truest, most intense flavors, the biggest throat hit, and most voluminous vapor production, aside from RBA/RDAs, there is simply nothing better.

###The Equipment

* a battery/mod -- could be as small as a 510/901 cig-a-like, as large as a 26650 Stinger, or anywhere in between.
* your dripping atomizer (I prefer bridgless)
* drip tip
* drip shield &amp; 510-510 shorty adapter (optional)

##Battery

This part of this equation should be simple enough (if you're not sure of your threading, ask in comments, but 99.9% of you have a 510 threaded device).

##Atomizer

The real question is how much $$ do you want to spend.

Want to just try out dripping? I like [these little 3 hole drippers](http://www.valuevapor.com/VV/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=79&amp;products_id=504) for $5/ea. They function well, have a decent lifespan, and produce good flavor. 

Want something a little higher quality? [These Vapage AMG attys at $9/ea](http://www.vapage.com/AMG_Hybrid_Universal_2_pack_p/vpa-052-054.htm#) are the ones I use for all my [juice reviews](http://www.VaporRater.com). They produce excellent flavor, last an exceedingly long time, and are very easy to clean. For the price, I have found nothing better, and believe me, I've looked.

Want to dive in head first and have cash burning a hole in your pocket? Everyone loves to rave about the [HH.357](http://www.avidvaper.com/hh-357-long-barrel-hybrid-510-atomizer/). Is it a good atomizer? You bet your ass it is...is it $22 worth of good, making it 225% better than the AMGs, not in my personal opinion, but vaping is all about personal opinions, so maybe it's $22 worth of good to you. As with almost everything vaping related, the old adage YMMV always applies.

##Drip Shield

Now that you've got yourself a dripping atty, you should probably pick up a drip shield. You can go with the [Chinese variety](http://www.valuevapor.com/VV/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=34&amp;products_id=569) which will obviously be less expensive, or go with the original, an [Empire](http://www.empiremods.com/category_s/21.htm), which are of a higher quality and more intricately designed. The shields serve several purposes...they will stop leaks, keep your atty cooler by acting as a heat sink, and will affect the draw depending on the original draw of your atty. If you overfill your atty, the juice will puddle near the lower o-ring of the shield, and can be easily pulled back in when the atty is getting dry, acting as something on mini tank, but anymore than a few extra drops could lead to flooding of the entire set-up. Some folks love the shields (like myself), others abhor them, it's something you need to decide for yourself. 

##Adapter

Because shields were originally intended for 901 attys which are longer than a 510, a [510-510 shorty adapter](http://www.empiremods.com/product_p/510-510s.htm) may be necessary to extend the length of your atty enough to make room for the shield. Some mods have this extra space in the form of a large juice well below the connector (eVic, Tmax, et al) others do not (ProVari). Unless you are using a bottom feeder mod, you would want the sealed adapter to ensure against leaking. 

###How to Drip

This is as easy as it gets. You can either drip straight down your drip tip, should you have a nice wide tip, or remove the tip and drip onto your atty. A fresh atty, depending on which type you choose, can usually hold anywhere from 5 drops to 12 or more as the mesh absorbs the juice. When you start to taste the atty going dry, add 3-7 drops (again, depending on the atty) and vape away. Drip shields do allow you to drip freely w/o worrying about flooding your atty, but it is possible to overfill past the shields capacity as well, so don't overdo it.

The whole process of drip, vape, repeat is the reason so many vapers gravitate towards tank/clearo systems, but for me, and many others, this has become part of the ritual. For others it's still a PITA, but worth it for the intense flavor and overall superior vape vs cartos and clearos, but again this is all very personal and something you have to decide for yourself.

###Atomizer cleaning

(**Do this at your own risk--not recommended for cleaning HH.357 which should only be soaked in PGA**) 

Just like the coils on any *omizer, dripping attys also get gunked up and need to be cleaned. There has been a lot of debate about the best way to accomplish the cleaning process, and I'm sure others will toss in their methods, but this is how I do it, and it has never failed to bring an atomizer back to almost brand new.

* blow air thru your atty **from the connector end**. Do this into a papertowel, as all the old juice caught up in the mesh will come sputtering out. **Never blow the other direction**, only in the direction air was intended to travel through an atomizer. 

* When all the old juice is removed connect the atty to a device, and do a series of very careful dry burns. 

* Fire the atty, let go, repeat, never for longer than a few seconds. As soon as the entire coil begins to glow during the firing process, slow it down, and gently blow air into the atty to cool it down a bit. Continue this process until the gunk on your coil is no longer being burned off and you're only seeing the glowing coil, no more or very little smoke. **Do not hold down the fire button for more than a second or two at a time, you will pop the coil.**

* When the coil is fairly clean (and the atty is cool enough to touch), run water from the faucet thru the atomizer for a minute or so to remove any ash and gunk you may have freed up, and begin the entire process over again, starting with blowing out the water. **You do not need to wait for the atty to dry if you blow all of it out.** The remainder will steam away and help to remove even more gunk the next time around, similar to deglazing a pan. You may need to repeat the whole process several times or more for a very dirty coil.

* The final step is optional, but I like it. Allow the atty to sit in PGA (Everclear) for 30 min to overnight. This will help to give the mesh surrounding the coil and good cleaning too.

You may very well pop a few coils while getting the hang of it, but the payoff is an atty that is *almost* brand new again...I have brought attys back from the dead with this method to the point where the silica is almost bright white and the coil looks damn close to brand new.

That's all there is to it...

Ignore that, people have spoken in PMs and elsewhere. Let's roll with NV. Nicotine Vaporizer. 

What does it mean to you? 

Currently there are no less than 9 major organizations, governmental or otherwise, threatening our precious lung yummies. The things you call PVs, Ecigs, or other vaious names, are being pushed into multiple existing categories. 

These categories are not good for us. If they become tobacco products, depending on the regulation terminology, they'll be taxed and controlled as a tobacco product. This will increase cost and in the worst scenario, remove all non tobacco flavored E-liquids, remove the ability to ship E-liquid via USPS (another cost increase) and raise taxes to the point that you'll be back to paying the ridiculous prices you used to pay for cigarettes. 

The other category they're looking at in multiple locales is a medical product or 'drug delivery system'. This has already been squashed in the US but it applies to many other plots of dirt around the globe. This will hit the producers of e-liquid and hardware in ways that are hard to measure but we know it'll hit hard. The entire industry could change. 

So, why am I bringing up a new acronym. NV. Because I want to get behind a third option. 

I want to build a social awareness program for NVs around the concept that these are NOT Cigarettes or tobacco. They are NOT smoking cessation aids/drugs. This is a new category of product. It doesn't happen often that something hits the market that cannot be easily filed away into one of the existing regulatory ""bins"". This is one of those situations. 

It's time to start treating this as a separate product, it's time to start portraying it as a separate product and it's time to differentiate ourselves from the various 'other' products we keep being associated with. 

PV ties to illicit drug use. 
E-cig ties to cigarette and tobacco.

E-liquid and E-juice are perfectly viable names for our liquids, but the hardware needs to change. NV is the way to go, it's accurate, it's catchy, and it's part of the campaign. 

The ultimate goal here is to effect a change in public perception, which is mostly impossible... but we need to move this into it's own product category and push for the FDA and other organizations to treat it as such. A separate entity with it's own rules and regulations. 

I will be driving this campaign with or without support. It will include media, resource information, and articles. 

I will be posting links to supporting articles and studies relating to our hobby. I will be posting Monkey U's on 'what an NV is' and I will be contacting as many industry experts and advocates to support the concept. It's starting here though... 

I firmly believe that the Reddit community is one of the strongest and most capable communities out there. If we lead the pack on this it will happen. 

We have time, this isn't a lost cause, and based on reports from a friend who recently was invited to speak with the FDA, there is support for us within the FDA along this path. The opposition is big tobacco, anti smoking nazis, and the pharmaceutical industry.... basically people with something to lose financially or with misguided moral agendas. 

Stay tuned here for more detail. The beneficial economic and public health effects of NV's blossoming as an industry are undeniable, yet we're being denied. It's time to shift perception and go on the offensive for our industry.

My Reply:

I changed the subject to (""Smokeless"" cigarette ""issue"") lol

&gt;All,

&gt;As a long time user of an ‘electronic cigarette,’ or ‘personal vaporizer’ as they have started to be called after technological evolution has prevented most models from looking anything like an actual cigarette, I am having a hard time understanding what the “issue” is. Over the years, I have had a few run-ins with confused individuals over my activity with an ‘electronic cigarette’ (from here on referred to as simply PV for personal vaporizer). I have never found myself in a facility with an outright ban on them, nor have I ever been removed from an indoor area for ‘vaping’ (vaporizing).

&gt;In my experience, the people who make these decisions often do so hastily, out of fear and confusion, and rarely do any research. I am here to assist in this regard, providing both personal experience and actual scientific studies that have been published, both in the past, and recently.

&gt;First, let us take a look at the Ohio revised code:

&gt;Chapter 3794: SMOKING BAN
(A)	""Smoking"" means inhaling, exhaling, burning, or carrying any lighted cigar, cigarette, pipe, or other lighted smoking device for burning tobacco or any other plant. ""Smoking"" does not include the burning of incense in a religious ceremony.

&gt;This will be referred to later. Please note the crystal clear definition of what smoking is. 

&gt;An electronic cigarette, ecig, personal vaporizer, advanced personal vaporizer, digital cigarette, electronic nicotine delivery system; no matter what one calls them, they all refer to the same thing. That item being a battery powered vaporizer (atomizer) which is used to vaporize a fluid (often referred to simply as juice) comprised of three simple ingredients: propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerine (the former is used in fog machines, deemed perfectly safe by the FDA, the latter is used in all manners of food, including hard candy and cake icing), flavoring (food grade, again approved by the FDA), and liquid nicotine. The battery is activated, giving power to the atomizer, which heats up to between 150 and 300 degrees Fahrenheit, high enough to vaporize the juice. Nothing is burning. There is no tobacco or any other plant. There is no smoke involved in this process, only vapor. In fact, the devices cannot even get hot enough to cause paper to combust. This process has come to be called vaping, as there is a very clear difference between it and smoking. Please refer to the snippet of Ohio revised code at this time. The user will exhale, if anything at all, a cloud of water vapor. This vapor can sometimes have an odor to it, and it is almost always very candy-like in nature. For more information on how a PV works, [please visit this link](http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/everyday-innovations/electronic-cigarette.htm).

&gt;Now that one has loosely educated on how a PV works, one may still be wondering ‘are they safe?’ Doctors have been researching this topic for years, mostly in Europe, and have so far come up with with nothing suggesting that a PV is unsafe for its user, much less anyone in the vicinity. They have found that, since the device uses vapor, it is absorbed almost instantly by oral glands, often times not even requiring inhalation. The user then will exhale nothing but water vapor, which dissipates into the atmosphere in under 15 seconds. It has been shown that any residual nicotine left in the vapor cloud has a half-life of about 11 seconds. Compare this to the half-life of cigarette smoke, which is 15 minutes ([source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0761842513000855), sorry it is mostly French). Of course, as stated, the user exhales a cloud of water vapor, which can feasibly cause harm to someone with severe respiratory problems. Such a condition will cause its host to avoid even simple fog machines. 

&gt;[Here is a very recent cytotoxicity report on PV usage.](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/08958378.2013.793439) This report shows that, of fluids tested, only one showed any cytotoxicity (destructive to cells), and that particular one was at least 20 orders of magnitude less toxic than a traditional cigarette. The team surmised that this toxicity came from a bad batch of flavoring, as the other fluids tested in the study were similar in nature, but of different flavors. Currently, the only known danger with a PV is possible nicotine overdose caused by the nicotine level of a juice being too high, purposefully ingesting a large amount of juice, or coming in contact with a very high dilution of nicotine fluid meant for cutting to a lower dilution (which is not available for purchase in normal stores). Taking the point further, many people use a PV with no nicotine, and just for the taste. In fact, there is someone in this very building who mixes his own caffeine juice and uses an electronic pipe to vaporize it.

&gt;Speaking of nicotine and caffeine:
“[Nicotine is] only slightly more dangerous than caffeine, and being investigated as a treatment for Parkinsons disease.
See the following DOI's: 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2007.01949.x, 10.1007/BF02244882, 10.1016/0306-4522(94)00410-7.”

&gt;To sum up, there are currently zero known negative side effects caused, to the user and others in the vicinity, by using a PV. Compare this to traditional cigarettes, which have a staggering amount of additives, cancer causing agents, toxic elements, and even cause health problems for bystanders. I implore you all to please do your homework and come up with your own solution to this. Stay out of the politics of the situation, as usual, they are never good. The FDA has been dancing between big tobacco (don’t want to lose their business) and Congress (don’t want to lose the tax money) for the past few years and will not give the public a straight answer.

&gt;With that all said, I would like to give some personal background and my experiences on this topic. I began smoking cigarettes at age 19, and by 23 I was up to a pack a day. The day I heard about electronic cigarettes, I spent hours researching them. The next day I ordered my very first one, and when it arrived, I immediately quit smoking cigarettes. Within a week, the garbage that comes with tobacco had all left my system and I felt magnificent. I could breathe again. I could taste again. I wasn’t coughing my lungs up every morning. This also led into and assisted my weight loss efforts, eventually shedding 135 pounds in 18 months. That is an entirely separate story, but just read that again and try to tell me vaporized nicotine is bad for you.

&gt;After using a PV for a few years, I decided to quit and save the money I was spending on it. Going cold turkey, I went a whole year with no nicotine, before occasionally ‘bumming’ a cigarette. Six months later, I was back to buying cigarettes (this job, I tell ya! Haha j/k). I didn’t want to smoke, and was having a hard time quitting, so grabbed a disposable PV from a gas station. Here was when I realized how much I missed the increased alertness nicotine provided me, as well as how it helps me wake up in the morning, since I don’t do coffee. I decided to go back to using a PV full time, and this time around, I am mixing my own juice. I wear proper safety equipment and responsibly clean all of my tools. Unsafe levels of nicotine in mixing fluid are hard to come by (nearly impossible) for the general public, but better safe than sorry.

&gt;I have not recently, and have never heard complaints from my colleagues on the use of my PV. As I stated earlier, the odor is normally candy-like, and today I have brought with me cinna-bun and gummy bear. The man sitting to my left earlier told me how fruity and good the gummy bear vapor smelled. Then, five minutes later, made a comment about the less than satisfactory scent of the canned tuna I am eating. From this, I have drawn the conclusion that my eating habits are more disruptive to my coworkers than my vaping habits.

&gt;Just let me know if there is any more information I can provide or any questions I can answer.

No official policy changes have been made, and no official documents have been handed to us. I will continue to use my PV indoors until I see such.

Yes, I got paid to write all that. Heheh. Special thanks to the thread going on in /r/science right now for helping me gather good information very quickly. Sorry I posted this more than once, had some trouble with formatting and errors in the title.

I have spent a good deal of my life training to help prevent diseases caused by smoking. On a daily basis, I graphically witness and treat the repercussions of tobacco abuse.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I ask every patient I see if they smoke - for how long, how many ppd, etc. Usually people give me a frank yes or no, and tell me how much. For about the past few months, there has been a complete sea change where I imagine about 85% of the smokers, after telling me they smoke, quickly add that they are trying to quit. Then I ask what they are doing to quit, and they say, ""Vaping."" I did not even know what it was a while back. But at first I was delighted that this new invention was helping so many people quit.

However, I have the opportunity to have longitudinal care of these patients. Of the 85%, literally 0% have quit. Not only that, but I follow up on questions now. I ask, ""How many packs per day now?"" And I ask, ""How often are you vaping?"" I find that the vast majority have not declined in cigarette consumption, and if so by slim margins, but have drastically increased in vaping. Not only that, but some have transitioned to simply using e-smoking as a method to smoke inside buildings.

So you who have had a success with these, can you describe what made the transition successful? 
Have any of you relapsed and now smoke (cigarettes/vapor) more than you had before vaping?

Another startling aspect is I often enter my examination room and the patient is in the middle of vaping. I wasn't sure what to think of this at first, but after thinking about how we simply do not know the long-term risks, I have made it clear in my office that there will be no vaping inside.

What do you think of this rule? Does it make you angry and why?

Lastly, I have an uncle who uses a cinnamon flavor. Since using it he has developed a new cough. He continues to smoke 2ppd and uses it to smoke inside. He mentions that the canister to hold the cinnamon mix has burst before from the chemical. I'll admit that I do not really know how the chemicals/flavors/pieces of the actual device work, but I did find this worrisome.

Have you noticed any new symptoms since beginning vaping? New cough? Runny nose? Shortness of breath? A constant want or need to vape? Any burning sensations?

Have you noticed the flavorings/chemicals having any ill effect on your e-device itself?

Responses would be much appreciated. 


EDIT: I meant to say that I was watching the Conjuring the other day in the movie theater, and the person directly in front of me vaped throughout the whole movie. So I had to sit there and watch through the constant stream of vapor. It really made me upset. 

How do you guys feel about using them in front of children and in places like movie theaters?

EDIT 2: After reading the first reply, I realize I should ask what benefits you have had from vaping, too.

&gt;To whomever it may concern,

&gt;I have just read an article on the KXAN news site about the smoking ban on all Travis county properties. Included in this article is a mention that this ban extends to include electronic cigarettes. Personally, I find this to be outrageous. 

&gt;Electronic cigarettes have been a godsend for me. After years of unsuccessful attempts at quitting smoking, I have finally found a way to quit. Gone are my days of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. Gone, too, are my days of labored breathing, coughing, congestion, sore throats every morning, yellowed finger tips, bad breath, a racing heart rate, smelly clothes - the list goes on. I even ran three miles two days ago, non-stop, and I haven't run in months. It was easy, even. 

&gt;I have watched e-cigarettes transform for the better the lives of six other friends of mine in Austin alone, and have had several others ask me about it - interested in finally defeating cigarettes once and for all. 

&gt;These people deserve this chance. Many have already tried the patch, the gum, cold turkey, and plenty of other smoking cessation methods, without success. However, you have now set a precedent that is going to lump those products in with a far worse product - a proven killer which we are all trying to evade. 

&gt;I would urge you to reconsider this ban, and do look at the research. While its true that this relatively new technology isn't thoroughly researched, all of the research so far points to electronic cigarettes being vastly superior to the real thing in every single way. The worst effects that anyone has been able to prove have essentially been no different than drinking coffee. 

&gt;Please, for the sake of all those who seek to finally be released from the grip of the tobacco cigarette, reconsider this ban. Don't send us back to it by removing the one thing that helps us. 

Good Guy Gerald Daugherty responds: 

&gt;Great points. I for one will re-look at this ban on the electronic cigarettes. Thanks for the message.

&gt;Are you a County employee?

I figured it was just a manufacturer's defect and I decided to take it in to get a replacement.

The female clerk plugged it in to a voltmeter, showed me that there was some power in the battery and therefore wouldn't exchange it. She then told me that I was probably plugging it in before it was completely drained, which gave the battery a memory and ruined it. I assured her this was not the case, so she went to the back to ask the owner. When she returned, she told me the owner said 'no' as well. When I asked if I could speak to him she told me that he was eating lunch and probably wouldn't talk to me, but she went in the back anyway.

The owner returned a few seconds later and I began explaining my story again. He interrupted me and told me that I must have been using it wrong, and that since he couldn't watch me every second of the day to make sure I was using it correctly, he wouldn't replace it. I asked what the 14-day guarantee was supposed to cover. He replied that since it worked at all, he wasn't liable.

I then tried to make an analogy to another product such as a car, he interrupted me again. I asked him not to interrupt me and he told me to lower my voice. (I admit I had gotten a bit louder when he said this, but my demeanor had been firm but reasoning up to this point.) I asked if would let me speak and he replied, ""Leave. Get out. You're and asshole and don't ever come back.""

I gathered my things in disbelief and walked out the door. Outside on the driveway, he yells, ""You're a prick!"" As I get around the corner, he yells again, ""And so's your mother!""

I did not speak a word of profanity to this man or the clerk and I only raised my voice a bit to speak over being interrupted by him. Apparently they have plenty of customers and don't need my business.

I had horrible anxiety and panic attacks thinking I was going to die all the time. Imagine feeling your heartbeat skip beats than beat really hard. Yeah.

So I finally went to the doctor and he explained what they were. It did help knowing they were non-lethal, but for some reason it always gave me anxiety (I'm not talking about being nervous, i'm talking about being literally convinced I was going to die) and I'd be stuck with it for life.

Doc told me that one major contributing factor was my smoking. I tried several times, but I just couldn't quit. I switch to electronic cigarettes two years ago, and even though it still contains nicotine, but heart palpitations all but vanished. Apparently, it wasn't the nicotine, it was the carcinogens in the cigarettes causing all the effects. Anyways, they are almost completely gone now and i have electronic cigarettes to thank :D",,False,self,t5_2qmlu,False,,,True,t3_17ix23,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/17ix23/electronic_cigarettes_actually_changed_my_life/,

So I know many of you have been hanging out here for a goodly long time. You've seen a metric fucktonne of ego/stardust vaper's first setups, you've run the full gamut of designer juice, you're fanangling new and exciting quintuple-coil builds on a magical mech mod that you've plated the contacts with unicorn's blood to somehow reverse voltage drop and grant you a wish every 273rd puff.

Even though it's been awhile, the information overload when you're starting out is still real. The need for clarification is something everyone goes through. The excitement to get away from the nails is just as tangible for each and every person.

In general, by and large, this sub is super awesome. Knowledgeable, friendly people help out curious smokers; we all revel in this wonderful tasty hobby, and everyone gets along great. Every once in awhile someone gets frustrated, or feels like they've been vaping for so very long (read: a few short years, you are not an elite ninja) that it's OK to snub people seeking information with no context, or maybe you forget how to filter 'new vaper question's with RES.

I wouldn't be where I am if it weren't for the community's help, patience, support and friendship. 99.9% of the time positivity is all I see, just sayin for that .01% of the time, maybe think back to when you first started vaping; remember how overwhelming it was, how you probably wouldn't have bothered if it weren't for some helpful folks, and how glad you are that you took the plunge.

Edit: Not trying to hate on anyone, just saying maintaining perspective is good. New and old, tall and short, hobbiest and cigalike-user, we're all here for the same reason.

Forum members are complaining there is no singular place to find updates, no consumer voice that the EU or any government will listen to, and we are scattered all over the place, some places never even knowing whats going on.

So I set up 3 social networks about the vaping bans.

None of these have to be just about the EU (even though the FB says EU in it) 

I can update all of these at the same time through hootsuite at any time, there is a dedicated email address vapersagainsttheban@gmail.com where people can email me anything  found about the EU ban or any other ban worldwide and I will social network the shit out of them. Along with these 3 accounts, I will also utilize the other 6 social networks I have access too. 

So with all that said, I am just one person and I really need the help of some of the bigger voices in the vaping communities worldwide in order to ""spread the word"" and bring all of us together about all these bans happening. 


Will you help me please? Maybe you can help with a PSA type video or audio clip for it?

Read this if your thinking about starting vaping.",140,28,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/19539b/seriously_guys_im_sold_read_this_if_your_thinking/,"About a week ago I saw the freebie disposable ad from Panda and I ordered one, mostly out of curiosity from seeing things like them in gas stations and convenience stores.  I had no inkling that I would be quitting smoking from using it, but I was intrigued. I got it in the mail a couple days later and took it to work with me the next day. It wasn't the greatest thing ever, but it was good enough to get me through the work day without a smoke.

Ever since I placed the original order I started lurking here and reading and researching as much as I could and I started to really think about the possibility of actually quitting. The one thing that really had me worried was my wife. She has been a pack a day smoker for about 16 years (I was a pack a day for 18y years) and she is so stubborn, she'd make a mule cry.  Whenever we'd try to quit, she would get the same withdrawals everyone else does, but pile on an unhealthy dose of anxiety on top of it. Not fun. Well, after seeing the freebie from Panda, and a bit of hype on my part(and I went to the store and bought us a couple of those Blu's), she, VERY reluctantly, gave in and we each got our own styles of starter kits. I got the eGo kit from Panda and she got an RN4081 cigalike kit from AquaVaporCig.com.

All our stuff got here on Friday evening, which was perfect timing as we were going on a day trip to visit her mother on Saturday. Let me mention that her mom hates smoking and smokers and she has no idea that either of us smoked and would likely murder us in our sleep if she found out. So this was going to be a good test to see if it could curb the even one day withdrawals we were so used to when visiting her.

Let me tell you... I am amazed. One day with this thing and I have little to no craving for an analog. Same for her, which surprised the hell out of the both of us but especially me.

Since we got back yesterday evening, we have put in an order for some more cartos for her kit, some shorty cartos for me, and three more bottles of juice all from madvapes. We stopped on the way back into town and I bought a carto tank and a 30ml bottle of pomegranate juice(amazing) from a local B&amp;M(way too expensive and I probably won't go back too often, and I feel bad about this but I am on a budget). This morning we saw the 50% coupon code for the Panda Evolve kit and jumped on it. Now she's sitting on her tablet and browsing juice sites more more stuff. This is insanity.

So, for any of you out there reading this and are thinking about taking up vaping to try and quit smoking, stop reading right now and go order it. Just fucking do it. You will not regret it. And for you wonderful people of ECR, I owe you all a big, hairy bear hug.

THANK YOU!

I've been a bit uppity lately. That's gonna stop. My stress levels are through the roof for a variety of reasons and as such, I've been an almost troll with some of my posts. It's inappropriate and NOT who I am. That's gonna change. Roast-a-botch made a comment about missing the Humble Monkey in one of my threads and he was 100% dead on. 

I've always been a confident person, but arrogant... not a word that was used to describe me before. I've been acting arrogant and borderline elitist, it's not who I am but it's who I feel myself turning into and it's an ugly thing. So... I'm publicly apologizing for my recent change in tone and habits. If I offended you or in some way said something that made you feel like I thought I was better, or my ways were better, or that I played down your personal preferences in any way, shape, or form. I apologize. 

I'm here for the vapers and the vaping community. I started my business because I wanted to get in the game and try to make a difference. I believe, whole heartedly, that vaping is an amazing innovation and boon to the economy and public health. I want to do everything I can to push it forward, help save lives, help make people smell better, and make everything safer, easier, and more cost effective when it comes to vaping in general. Those are my goals, there are a million paths to those goals and I lost sight of the fact that people not on the path I prefer are also moving towards the same goals and shouldn't be hindered or in any way judged. 

I love this place, even when it makes me want to stab my monitor, this is my unofficial ""home on the internet"" so I hope the folks I've offended will accept my apology.

The below issue has been completely, utterly resolved in a manner that was timely, effective, remarkably professional, and perhaps one of the most forthcoming and honest admittance I've ever seen. The people at Vaporskinz apparently care very much about the way in which they conduct themselves and, by their actions here alone, I appreciate the reputation they strive to maintain. 

_________________________

I've sat on this for a few days, but I can't anymore. I can't ignore this sort of thing, I really can't.


The other day, while browsing Vaporskinz in a hope to find something for the Vamo I was getting, /u/adelwolf brought to my attention that you had a great Cthulhu skin. You also have it for the [Lavatube](http://www.vaporskinz.com/collections/lavatube-2-0-vapor-skinz/products/chulthu-lavatube-2-0-skin) and the [MVP](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/chulthu-mvp). The Vamo one has been taken down(as it should be, along with the rest). 


You see, when I saw the picture, I instantly recognized it! I am quite the Lovecraft fiend, and I knew the art looked familiar. So, using my google-fu, I found [the artwork and the artist](http://jhimmelman.carbonmade.com/projects/4699079#5). And then something dawned on me.


""...Does this guy *know* that Vaporskinz is using his art for profit?""


I grew vaguely alarmed and EMailed him, linking him to the Vamo Cthulhu skin, asking if he knew and if VS had asked for permission to use his art. The next day, I recieved an email saying that he did not know, had not been contacted, and was receiving no royalties at all for this, and that they would be receiving a stern email.


Two days later, while they have indeed taken down the Vamo version of the Cthulhu skin, the MVP and Lavatube is still there for sale.


Furthermore, because I am both curious and thorough, I started to look at the rest of the skins. ...I was a bit annoyed by what I found.


The Devil skin that you offer for the [MVP](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/devil-mvp), [Lavatube](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/devil-lavatube-2-0-skin), [Provari](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/devil-provari-skin), and [Zmax](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/devil-zmax-skin) uses art by [Václav Křivánek](http://www.washek.com/), and not only are you using the art - and I have a sinking feeling of 'without his permission' - but you've also editing the [original image](http://www.washek.com/gallery/hell/hell.jpg). 


The art that you are using for the Mummy Skull skin you sell for the [VMax](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/mummy-skull-vmax-skin), [MVP](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/mummy-skull-mvp),  [EVic](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/mummy-skull-evic), [Silver Bullet](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/mummy-skull-silver-bullet-skin), [Provari](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/mummy-skull-provari-skin), [Lavatube](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/mummy-skull-lavatube-skin), [ZMax](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/mummy-skull-zmax-skin) and [Lavatube v2](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/mummy-skull-lavatube-2-0-skin) belongs to [Andrew Dobell](http://www.andrewdobell.co.uk/).

The art that you are using for the Smoke Stormtrooper skin you sell for the [Vamo](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/smoke-stormtrooper-vamo-skin), [EVic](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/vapor-stormtrooper-evic), [MVP](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/smoke-stormtrooper-mvp), and [Lavatube v2](http://www.vaporskinz.com/products/smoke-stormtrooper-lavatube-2-0-skin) belongs to [Kyle Schruder](http://www.kyleschruder.com/projects/Smoke-Helmet/). 

I think I have made the point I am trying to make here. I haven't looked through every single skin you've found, but there may be other instances of this in the mix. I have a sinking feeling that, like Mr. Himmelman, you have not contacted these artists, have not asked permission to use their art, and are not paying them any royalties for the usage of said art. If that is the case, what you're doing is *not acceptable*. Unless you have express permission of an artist, you can't just go around, taking pictures you find cool off the internet, slap them on a skin, and sell them for profit. It's illegal, it's certainly immoral, and it's just downright uncool. These artists put time and effort into their art, and I'm sure that some artists - not all of them - do not offer their art as prints for profit, because it's their art and they don't want it sold.

Apologies for the business related post but I believe in transparency and at some point some one would have run into this and posted a ""OMG STEAMMONKEY WANTS TO TAKE ALL MY MONEYS"" post so I figured I'd at least go on record with why :) 

I put it at 1.01 specifically to block the 1 piece of kanthal orders, no other transaction actually 'costs' me money to ship except those so, most of you shouldn't be effected. Those of you that just wanted a single piece of kanthal and are now outraged that you can't purchase that.... seriously, go look around in your car for some change and order two pieces, you're payin more for the shipping than you are the product :P

If you have a complaint about a vendor, and appropriately share it under the ""bad reviews"" section the post will be deleted and you will be banned though you did not violate forum rules. They openly communicate it is because of secret and confidential decision-making by the mods.

Object to these secret rules publicly, and you will get banned. They will even go into your account and delete your ""likes given"" and ""likes received"". They do not respond to questions about this.

If given a temporary ban (sort of like punishing a child) you will then be monitored, indicated by an asterisk by your name, and given demerit points.

1356899283.0,105,self.electronic_cigarette,15oq5z,In honor of my cake day - here are some answers to questions asked here all of the time...,137,32,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/15oq5z/in_honor_of_my_cake_day_here_are_some_answers_to/,"1.) You got a starter kit from a reputable website?  You did fine... seriously.  Most kits are a CE type clearo and an eGo style batt - and come with a bottle of juice.  That's good stuff right there and it will work.

2.) T3's are great... until they suck... or you don't and they gurgle.  The wicks degrade and juice gets below the coil/wick assembly into what is a little reservoir that is needed for the eGo connection.  Tip that bitch while vaping to get the juice towards the coil wick and it will burn up the remaining juice.  There's your fix.

3.) We have flair on this sub - use it - I was a major proponent for vapemail at one point in time, but now, it's like it's every other post.  There's a lot of new vaper's asking questions without applying it and they are not getting information that would otherwise be beneficial without that tag.  So use the flair! WOOOO!

4.) If you ask for a juice vendor - it's gonna be MBV here.  That's www.mtbakervapor.com.  I recommend the Banana's Gone Nuts.  

5.) Vendors post here, so if you post something about one of their companies - don't be a dick if you want help... Posting ""Arggghhhh - I ordered yesterday and my vapemail isn't here - F*!&amp;@ so and so vendor"" is not gonna get help, but being cool, saying ""Hey, I ordered a week ago, and my shipping confirmation hasn't been sent out yet, what's up so and so vendor"" will most likely get you a great deal of help and contact information.

6.) Pretty much everyone has a VAMO now.  Yes, for the money, they are awesome.  

7.) Slumberland has good RBA's.  If you are going to buy one from ANYONE and all you have is an eGo battery with no way to test resistance?  You're gonna have a bad time.  Get a multimeter or a mod that can at least show your resistance.

8.) You're probably going to get liquid on your connector at some point in time.  Some Iso alcohol on a q-tip will fix ya up.  They are sealed, you'll be fine.

9.) Provari.  That's it and all I am saying about it.

10.) Check out the chat room if you haven't - there are a ton of knowledgeable people there that can help you out pretty much on-demand.  

11.) You don't know if XYZ website is good to order from?  Use the search function or.... check out the handy links on the sidebar - there's a [ton](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/eyc23/ecig_guides_help_and_suggestions/) of information - like [vendors](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/tjpxb/reddits_recommended_ecig_supplier_list_thread_2/) and even [mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/fk2zx/a_list_of_ecig_mods/)!

12.) Here's a link on juices that are KNOWN to crack tanks and cloud them.  Use at your own risk.  [Awesome ECF thread on juices that crack and cloud tanks and updated as need be by awesome ECF member my4jewels](http://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/tanks/219179-lets-make-list-juices-flavors-crack-tanks-ce2s-clearos-33.html#post8158663)

13.) Terms got ya down?  Here's a quick run down - 

* PV - Personal Vaporizer
* TH - Throat Hit
* VV/VW - Variable voltage/Variable Wattage
* Analogs/Logs - REAL Cigs
* Atty - Atomizer - this is what heats up the juice and turns it into vapor
* Clearomizer or Clearo - Tank with a wicking structure that stores juice - the atomizer is built into this device
* Cartomizer or carto tank - Tank you insert a cartomizer, which is a cartridge and atomizer in one, and it holds juice so you don't have to refill the carto constantly
* RBA - Rebuildable atomizer - it's an atomizer or tank that YOU build and coil and wick
* SS mesh - Stainless steel mesh - an advanced wicking material
* MOD - Advanced PV, usually refers to a PV with removable batteries and parts.
* Silica - this is the wick that comes standard in most clearos
* Ceramic - There are actually two different ways this is used in the vaping world.  One, it's a cup in Oddyseus and Penelope and clone RBA's.  Two - it can be used as a wicking material.  This is more advanced for use and you have to do your research.  Ask /u/slumberland - he will tell ya.

14.) This infographic is probably the best thing to look at when you are starting.  It's in the stickies, it's in the beginner's guide and it's here now.  Bookmark it please :)  All credit to the original creator [/u/ItwasMothmens](/u/ItwasMothmens) and the [/r/ecr](/r/ecr) community. http://i.imgur.com/wc76V.png

And last - this hobby is what you make of it.  You have an eGo C-Twist or a spinner and a nova and you are happy with it? It does what you want it to? Then fuck yeah, you're doing it right!  Some of us want collections, it's what keeps us off the logs, some of us are happy DIY-ing, some with RBA's and modding.  This isn't just a replacement now for most vapers - it's a hobby that you build upon and learn and make it what you want it to be.  Enjoy it, enjoy the community we have here and be respectful to everyone's opinions and ways of doing things, you'll probably learn something

If I left something out or you just wanna tell me anything - leave something here or I am in chat at night usually.  Anything at all - some things like ""Dub - you are awesome"" or ""Did vaping get you so ridiculously good looking or were you just born that way"", you know, anything at all! 

TL;DR - I'm a whore and it's my cakeday :)

We will be rolling this out very,very soon but i would like to get everyones opinions firsthand, before wide release. Please be brutally honest guys. If you guys really dig it, we should have our website up and going shortly. you guys could also help by giving me the phone numbers of any B@m's in your area that might be interested in our liquid, if possible. so a little bit about the company now

Pawn(noun) someone or something who is used or manipulated to further another persons purposes. Our liquid becomes the ""pawn"" Its both used, and manipulated to further another persons purposes. Its fitting that the game of chess(which is sophisticated and complex) uses the pawn. The pawn moves only forward on the chess board and is often sacrificed(much like our liquid) Being that chess is complex and sophisticated, we decided to start with five complex flavors. There are five traditional tastes known to man; 1. Salty 2. Bitter 3. Sour 4. Salty 5. umami(which is described as savory) the initial offering has a flavor that satisfies one of each of the five tastes or senses, hence the name FIVE PAWNS and ""it's your move..."".

All flavors are 100% organic and we use only the best ingredients sourced domestically. All liquid is made in the state of California. NO artificial flavorings OR colorings are used. Most of our blends result in a 50vg/50pg result. Our flavorings are all extracted from actual base ingredients and we offer 0mg 24mg 18mg 12mg and 6mg nicotine levels.


1. GRANDMASTER smooth and creamy peanut butter with banana cream and balanced throughout with a velvety caramel. Buttery and smooth, with a medium bodied throat hit.

2. ABSOLUTE PIN intense complexity of irish cream. cinnamon spice and caramel flavors mixed with a subtle absinthe undertone. lively and with a medium to full bodied throat hit.

3. GAMBIT sweet and mellow ripe apple with savory pie crust and caramel. topped off with french vanilla ice cream and unsweetened whipped cream. sweet and savory with a medium bodied throat hit.

4. QUEENSIDE delicate orange with creamy french vanilla. light yet creamy citrus with a medium bodied throat hit.

5. BOWDEN'S MATE crisp, yet subtle chocolate undertones and a french vanilla finish. delicate yet soft with a refreshing tingle. and medium to full bodied throat hit.

Forgot to mention, check out our Facebook for some slick pics of the packaging 

Edit: you guys are so awesome. Thanks so much for the feedback so far. so, pretty much we are looking at about 640 individual shipments that will all be going out within 1 week from tonight. All of our sample juices will be going out in 18Mg nicotine mixes. I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. Thanks again for participating. I really think you'll dig our liquid.

1367340862.0,106,self.electronic_cigarette,1df5gh,About that 'Daily Vape Mail' thread.,150,44,265,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1df5gh/about_that_daily_vape_mail_thread/,"Why is that thread still operational? I've yet to see it gain any real traction within this community. I know I'm not the only who thinks that it is a waste of time and is taking away one of the main social aspects of this community. Now I apologize if this rant is shit, it's been a long day and it's only 5:40 at the time of typing.

That being the new vapers. Now, I understand that people have seen *Ego kits* time and time again, but lets not forget that once upon a time we used to be one of the new guys. Eager to show our new kit to the world and proclaim how proud we where to kick analogues (for some) after all those years. But lets not take that away from the new guys. I know that I love seeing the newbies posting their kits, how they're doing after a few hours/days. I know it's very limited to what they're going to show us, but hey c'mon it's still fun. It also allows for us to suggest different *omizers and juices. Without that information some might get bored and fall back to smoking (a possibility none the less).

Moving away from the new guys and onto the 'experienced' or 'veterans' if you may, the same applies to them/us really. We get a shiny new mod, we aren't allowed to show it off unless it's special (Special being something I'll cover shortly). Again, why not?  I think that's all I have to say about that segment.

Now this whole 'Special' vape mail exception to the ban-- yes I'm calling it a ban-- what actually classifies. I seen a vape mail post the other day about Pluid- which was deleted. Now correct me if I'm wrong but getting Pluid is nearly impossible, well it seems that way in the UK. So what actually classifies as 'Special'? I'd imagine getting a very hard to get mod, such as a Chi-You or something up there. But then again, I'm still new to all this so perhaps I'm not well versed in what is special in the vaping world.

As you might have guessed, I'm against it. I'd love to see the vapemail posts flooding back to this subreddit, I miss seeing the new guys talking to the older guys about what they should be expecting in the coming days/weeks/months. I miss seeing people being ecstatic that their ego and 2 t3's or w/e have arrived in the post. 

EDIT^3 It has recently been brought to my attention that a sub called /r/E_Cigarette exists, it seems pretty small so everyone should go have a looksie there. Vape mail isn't illegal there and hopefully never will. I'm all for supporting newer subs, especially if it involves a strong love of mine

EDIT^2 It has been suggested by /u/Roast_A_Botch that we make vape mail a self post only and include the flair. I wholeheartedly agree with this. For a compromise, it is a very good one.

To conclude this...essay, I'd like to ask you guys, in the comments section to tell me how you feel about having a daily vape mail thread. Are you for or against it? Why?

EDIT: Formatting and a request: Please don't just upvote or downvote, include your thoughts on this.

Someone recommended I try calling a vendor directly, and seeing if they could go through FedEx and next-day me a package so I could get a new mod before I had to leave for Japan.

Indigo was able to do it...they added a special 'FedEx' item under their mod kit list, just for me. I placed an order for my new eVic, and two bottles of juice. They also included 2 other bottles of juice(bonus!), and got it all to me the very next day. [Here's a pic of my new gear.](http://i.imgur.com/iQrjISi.jpg)

That's stellar customer service in and of itself, but they went one step beyond. The first thing I found when I opened the box was a note that read as follows: ""Tony grew up in an army family and wanted to make sure you had a backup. It's a small starter that we had, but since you will be in Japan....Hopefully you won't need it, but just in case. (The charger is different from the eVic. And you screw off the bottom to charge it.)     Enjoy!""  So yeah, they just GAVE me a frickin eGo pass-through w/charging cable and a free vision stardust. It wasn't just any eGo passthrough, either. It's chrome with black etchings of Egyptian pyramids and Sphinxes. Damn sexy. This was truly above and beyond anything I would've expected, and they've earned themselves a lifelong customer for sure. [Here are my freebies.](http://i.imgur.com/XEu0kDD.jpg)

Not only good customer service, but I LOVE my new eVic...I love all the juices they gave me(their RY is probably the best I've ever tasted), and their Captain Ron and Eureka are both delicious, too. I haven't had a chance to try OOHRAH! yet...

Below is the next from the CASAA email.  Please take the time to do your part in ensuring we don't lose the right to do what we love and has helped save our lives.  

&gt;History:
&gt; 
&gt;The FDA held a public hearing on Section 918 on Monday, December 17, 2012. Many THR advocates testified. See: http://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/legislation-news/361023-more-details-analysis-fdas-december-17-hearing.html
&gt; 
&gt;For the hearing, we issued a Call to Awareness. This is now a related (as noted in the background section below) but separate Call to Action. The FDA will use the testimony that was given at the December 17 hearing, plus the written comments submitted by January 16, 2013 as input for the report to Congress required by the Tobacco Act. 
&gt; 
&gt;How to Submit Written Comments:
&gt; 
&gt;To submit a comment electronically: On the page http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FDA-2012-N-1148-0001, click the ""Comment Now"" button. Comments that you type into the comment field are limited to 2,000 characters. If your comment is longer, you can upload a file that contains your comment and just type ""See attachment"" into the Comment field.
&gt; 
&gt;To submit a comment by U.S. Mail: Send to the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. Identify comments with the docket number [Docket No. FDA-2012-N-1148].
&gt; 
&gt;Electronic or written comments will be accepted until January 16, 2013.
&gt; 
&gt;What to Say:
&gt; 
&gt;1. Describe your history as a smoker: When did you start? How long did you smoke? How much did your smoke?
&gt; 
&gt;2. Describe your quitting attempts: How many times did you try to quit? What different products and methods did you try? What did you like and dislike about the products or methods you tried?
&gt; 
&gt;3. If you stopped smoking completely some time in the past and experienced problems such as feeling depressed and/or anxious, getting along with others, concentrating, remembering, etc. describe those experiences.
&gt; 
&gt;4. Describe the effects switching to e-cigarettes has had on how much you smoke now.
&gt; 
&gt;5. Describe the health effects you have experienced as a result of switching to e-cigarettes (and/or snus).
&gt; 
&gt;6. Tell the FDA that there should not be any time limit on using NRTs, but that it would be better to raise the amount of nicotine each piece provides than to have people use multiple types of products.
&gt; 
&gt;7. Tell the FDA that innovative products such as e-cigarettes should not be made less effective by setting nicotine doses too low.
&gt; 
&gt;8. If you use e-liquid (or snus) that has a pleasant flavor added (such as fruit, candy, beverage), tell the FDA that this has helped you and describe how.
&gt; 
&gt;9. Urge the FDA to not propose the ""deeming"" regulation because it would ban e-cigarettes, and would sharply increase the price and reduce accessibility of the products even if FDA exempted e-cigarettes from the most onerous provisions in Chapter IX.
&gt; 
&gt;10. Ask the FDA to remove text from its web site that is inaccurate and/or misleading.
&gt; 
&gt;·         For example, many people believe that e-cigarettes are very likely to cause cancer or poison the user because the FDA ""forgot"" to mention that the amount of carcinogens detected in liquid are no higher than in pharmaceutical nicotine products such as the patch and gum, and that the only toxin detected was in an amount that has never been shown to endanger health.
&gt;·         Many people that might have switched to snus, which is much less hazardous to health than smoking, but they were convinced to continue smoking instead by the misleading statement ""This product is not a safe alternative to smoking.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;Background
&gt; 
&gt;The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Act) was structured to regulate cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and ""roll your own"" under a newly created Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) and to continue regulation of so-called ""Nicotine Replacement Products"" (NRPs) products and other drugs to treat ""tobacco addiction"" under the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER.)http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr1256/text
&gt; 
&gt;The concept of Tobacco Harm Reduction (THR) was introduced in Section 911 of the Tobacco Act, which calls for the CTP to define a process to test and approve ""Modified Risk Tobacco Products"" (MRTPs.)
&gt; 
&gt;Currently, the NRTs that are regulated by CDER have one purpose-total abstinence from nicotine. But 'SEC. 918. DRUG PRODUCTS USED TO TREAT TOBACCO DEPENDENCE' asks the Secretary of Health and Human Services to consider:
&gt;(1.) Designating products for fast-track research and approval within the meaning of Sec. 506 (See § 356. Fast track products http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title21/pdf/USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapV-partA-sec356.pdf.)
&gt;(2.) Extended use of NRPs
&gt;(3.) Additional indications for NRPs, such as for craving relief or relapse prevention
&gt; 
&gt;Sec. 918(b) requires the Secretary to submit a report to congress ""that examines how best to regulate, promote, and encourage the development of innovative products and treatments (including nicotine-based and non-nicotine-based products and treatments) to better achieve, in a manner that best protects and promotes the public health--
&gt;(A) total abstinence from tobacco use;
&gt;(B) reductions in consumption of tobacco; and
&gt;(C) reductions in the harm associated with continued tobacco use.""
&gt; 
&gt;If you substitute the word ""smoking"" for the words ""tobacco use"" in these three items, they fit the goals of the THR community. Until now, total abstinence from all tobacco use (not just from smoking) was the only regulatory goal of our government. This is still true within the World Health Organization and the European Union's Tobacco Control Framework. Sections 911 and 918 would change our focus to include measures to mitigate the harm caused by smoking.
&gt; 
&gt;Currently e-cigarettes are not regulated under either the CTP or CDER, but the CTP has announced that it intends to issue a deeming regulation that would bring e-cigarettes and other tobacco products under the Agency's regulatory authority.

1369336591.0,104,self.electronic_cigarette,1ex6h2,I got an interesting and exciting phone call from a fellow vapor today.,111,7,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1ex6h2/i_got_an_interesting_and_exciting_phone_call_from/,"Quick back story on this: I have a good friend that I have been playing games with online for about 4 or 5 years. A few months ago, I sent him a little care package of my first ecig that I didn't use anymore(2 eGo-C's, 3 DCT tanks, and about 5 bottles of juice). Since then, he has picked up a Vamo, new tanks, and going nuts'o on the juice from MBV. I told him that I didn't need the stuff back and to just pay it forward if he gets a chance. He has, a lot. About 5 people in around 4 months. 

Now, he just called me not too long ago telling me that the company he works for just signed a contract to start a reality show. I don't want to give any information about location, network, or what it's about until I know it's OK to talk about. BUT, his boss has some health issues from smoking and my buddy gave him the eGo's I sent him to try out. What he told me was that the producers are in love with this. They want part of the side story(?) to be about his health and possible come back from using ecigs.

I don't know if this show will even air for sure because they wont start filming for a while. Hopefully they don't demonize it at all or anything like that.

1367847770.0,104,self.electronic_cigarette,1dshxl,Monkey University 5-6-2013: Clearos and Cartos and Tanks OH MY!,116,12,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1dshxl/monkey_university_562013_clearos_and_cartos_and/,"Mornin Monkeys, 

Today I'll be discussing.... Clearos and Cartos and Tanks and all the other various types of ""toppers"" you can have. I'll dedicate a small portion of this to Rebuildables but most of it is going to be based on the various disposable and semi disposable toppers available on the market. 

Lets start with what all the toppers have in common... They're all atomizers. Hence the 'mizer' at the end of most of their names. They all have a heating element in em that connects to the battery. When the battery is engaged the coil, which is a wire with high electrical resistance, heats up as the poor little electrons struggle to flow through the miasma of complicated molecular bonds. That heat then vaporizes the liquid that has been delivered to the coil through any number of means. 


Initially in the vaping world you had ""Atomizers"" and ""Carts"". If you remember tea bagging and blue foam you are my brother, my sister... my compatriot... and no I'm not talking about Halo griefing and smurf cappuccinos I'm talking about actual freakin tea bags and blue spongey stuff. 

The original Atomizers were basically little metal tubes with a coil in the bottom and a 'bridge' of metal mesh over them that stuck up a bit inside the tube. ""carts"" were little plastic tubes that slid over these and had some sort of filler to hold the liquid in them, the filler made contact with the bridge and the bridge would transfer the liquid down to the coil. This is how it was 'supposed' to work and occasionally it even did! 

Eventually people realized it was better to just take off the cart, slap on a plastic tip and just manually feed the atomizer with liquid by dripping on it. And thus drip tips and ""dripping"" was born. 

Around the same time as ""atomizers"" some one decided to combine the Cart and the Atomizer and created a ""Cartomizer"". A cartomizer is just what it sounds like, a device that vaporizes shopping carts... err no, it's a cart and an atomizer combined! Thats it... yeah. The original designs for cartos was actually just that... they took the cart as designed and the atomizer as designed and just made them 1 piece. It was HORRIBLE. Very quickly they realized they didn't have to stick to that internal form factor and the cartomizer as we see most commonly today was born. Inside a cartomizer you've got a holly tube of silica sleeving with a coil either built inside or around it. The coil usually sits in the bottom third to about half way up the total length of the device and you'll oftentimes see a piece of regular insulated wire sticking out of the top of the inner sleeve and going back down to make the connection for the negative terminal. Around this sleeve and coil is a blanket of ""fluff"" I'm not 100% sure what this material is but I know it melts and gets nasty if you dry hit a carto... so dont. 

Cartos changed the world and for a while you had a very ""Mac Vs Microsoft"" thing going on. Cartos vs drippers, it was crazy. Cartos and Attys (shortened versions for now on, my Z key needs a break) both started to evolve. Attys dropped the bridge, enhanced the coil assembly so it was more conducive to dripping, got sealed bottoms to reduce leaking, some grew in size, etc. Cartos on the other hand took multiple evolutionary 'splits' as people tried to perfect the design. 

The ""clearomizer"" or clearo was next in line. The original clearos were basically cartos with clear tubes. No other difference... they were stupid and no one liked them except that one guy reading this going ""Hey I like those!"" Sorry  man, the cheese stands alone. Shortly after that some one decided to move the coil up top and stick little dangly bits of silica through it down into a clear tube full of liquid. This was a great idea except it sucked, leaked, and broke all the time. Users ""modified"" these by taking the tubes off and making their own tubes around the same time as 'carto tanks' were starting to catch on which I'll cover in a second. The ""clearomizer"" started coming out as a CE1, CE2, CE3, etc. People will tell you that a CE3 is ""this that and the other"" as far as details but they haven't been keeping up because the chinese companies making clearomizers will put whatever number on the end they think is gonna sell it so details based on ""model"" are pretty iffy at best. But... these things kept evolving. The folks making those little tanks with the ""Clearo"" guts in em inspired china and the Vivi Nova and other top coil clearos were born. Replaceable heads were pretty hot. Another path they took was the bottom coil. Where the coil is, surprise, on the bottom and instead of little dangly wicks it has little stubby wicks. Some have replaceable heads like the T3's others don't. 

In a neck and neck race for who will be king of the 'mizer' Cartos were still trying to move forward as well. We got Dual coil cartomizers which have... 2 coils. We got longer cartos and mega cartos that were ginormous but still ultimately just tubes with fluff in them. Then ""Tanks"" happened. People learned that you could put a big plastic tube around your carto, punch a hole in the side of the carto and juice would flow into it increasing capacity by quite a bit so you didn't have to refill all the time. This became a rather huge thing and cartos have basically become the 'replaceable head' part of a carto tank like a vivi nova head is the replaceable part for a clearo tank. 

So, with all these permutations of topper... I imagine you can see why it can get confusing pretty quick. ""Tank"" can mean so many things. Carto tank? clearo tank? vivi novas have tanks? Panzer tanks? I mean... if you come on here and say ""I like tanks!"" No one has any idea what you're talking about. 

So, the elephant in the room... the RBA, the Genesis Atomizer.. it's gaining in popularity pretty fast and it's understandable. People took the clearo idea where you've got a coil at the top and wicks going down into your juice below it and tried to 'make' that in their garage. What we ended up with is the predecessor to what you'll see called a 'genesis atomizer'. These devices will tend to have a center post with some method of attaching a wire to it and a screw or 'other' post that is part of the deck of the device for attaching the other end of the wire to it. You make a coil between these two posts, usually around a wick that sticks through a hole in the deck down into a tank full of liquid. There are a number of little 'versions' of this but at the core they're all the same. There are also 'dripper' rebuildables which have no tank, just the posts and you make a little coil around some wicking material and just drip into it. 

There will be an entire Monkey U on the history and future of RBAs so I'm not going into any more detail than that on RBAs just yet. This is geared more towards a new user looking for an education on ""toppers"".

You might notice I didn't mention the ego-T style tank or atomizer. Theres a reason... that horrible thing is a wretched peice of crap and is dead to me... DEAD.  No one should use them, no one should recommend them, and anyone selling them should be fined for negligence.

Recently, I was eating with a friend who does not vape at a whataburger in my area. We were conversing with the security guard (This was around 3-4am) and I had my PV with me. I tend to put in my mouth and fiddle with it a lot and was doing so, but not actually using it. In the middle of our conversation, an employee (not a manager) loudy and rudely interruped me by shouting from the booth she was sitting at instead of coming over to my table, saying ""We don't allow smoking in here, sir!"" I attempted to distinguish vaping from smoking, but she was not listening and repeated herself, this time adding ""I know what they are, I have one at home, we still don't allow them. We have no smoking signs"" (As a side note, they did NOT have no smoking signs, nor no vaping signs, I checked). I realized I wasn't going to win this argument and said I would comply, finished my meal and conversation, and then left. Before leaving I got her name and asked if she was a manager. Later that morning, I wrote the district manager about the incident, as we had previously been told vaping was ok by managers at that store, and also complained about this employee's attitude. Today, I recieved a response. Here it is:

""Ms. (my name here),

I will be in Regional Meetings all day on both Tuesday &amp; Wednesday.  You can call me anytime in the evening, if you so prefer.  I’m usually up until at least 11pm.
 
As for your question on e-cigarettes, our  company position on this is as follows:
 
Until the state or federal government issues regulations on their use or warnings on second-hand health effects, customers may use e-cigarettes within our restaurants.
 
All Managers have now been acquainted with this relatively new policy.  Hope this helps.  Sorry for any past confusion.  Thanks!

1363495988.0,101,self.electronic_cigarette,1ag7p9,Attention Vendors: There are a few threads here re: fraudulent card purchases after vape shopping. It's not user error by the purchasers. Here's why:,114,13,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1ag7p9/attention_vendors_there_are_a_few_threads_here_re/,"There are a few threads recently regarding fraudulent charges showing up on people's credit cards after making purchases from online e-cig vendors. 

This just happened to me as well. An unauthorized charge to match.com (this seems to be typical - possibly this is how the CC thieves are testing accounts)

Some are pointing to certain specific vendors - none of which I have used. This is very likely effecting multiple vendors.

It's not a virus or malware: All of my orders have been placed using my iphone or ipad. One benefit of iOS being so locked down is that it makes this, in practical terms, a non-issue.

The two most likely common denominators, and most common cause of wide breaches of this sort are:

1. Someone has found an exploit in an eCommerce system that multiple vendors are using

2. Someone has compromised one of the merchant payment systems.

3. Someone has compromised a web hosting provider that multiple vendors are using

I've been a web developer / software engineer for 17 years. I know a little bit about how this works.

The only way to get to the bottom of this will be for vendors to work with other vendors to try to find the common denominator here. Some vendor names have come up enough that it's likely they are one of the ones who have been compromised, but it's pretty apparent it isn't just one. 

Don't assume your system is safe. I'm going to post below with a list of all of the vendors I have used in the past 30 days. I encourage others who have been effected to do the same, so we can find commonalities. 

I realize not all vendors watch this subreddit. Vendors should be contacted directly as well, particularly if their names come up in multiple cases, and they should be encouraged to share basic info with other vendors about which eCommerce, payment and hosting services they use to see what the culprit is, then engage support for those systems to get the problem resolved, or switch to something else.

* The flavours, children! The flavours! I started off on Players flavour (as I smoke Players) and it was fine but got old. Today I filled up with watermelon and I can't get enough of hauling jolly rancher though it probably won't gain me any badass points with my still-smoking friends

* ""Shit, the bus is here and I didn't finish my smoke"" or ""I'll take the long way around so I have time for a cigarette"" or any other timeframe you give yourself based on requiring 5m to complete a smoke is no longer a worry because a. you don't have to commit to an entire cigarette and b. you can just keep vaping once you get on the bus or wherever you're going

* Sitting back in your chair and vaping up huge clouds is so utterly relaxing it reminds me why smoking was fun in the first place. And not holding onto a burning ember that you have to be careful about only adds to the chill vibe

Myths abound by those that either have an agenda, or no clue- and this fuels legislation. In my homestate of MN, my harm reduction choice (ecig) is treated just like a combustable/chemical ridden cigarette. Taxed at the same rate, and under the same rules for sales. They want to go further- just like many states are trying. SO- the point is...

If you no longer smoke because of ecigs and vaping- please take a couple minutes here and there and make your voice heard. Start here with your story perhaps. Join Casaa.org.

People who have been at this a long time might think this is just silly, but PVs are poised to get really big, really fast. When they do, all you vendors are going to be getting attention that you may not be prepared to handle.

The big flap these days is ""OMG we have no idea what's in ecig juice!"" Put an complete ingredients list with every flavor. Not a wall of text about how awesomely safe it is, and not a string of abbreviations. Propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, whatever ingredients are in the flavoring, nicotine.

Going further down this road, another concern is that the juice is mixed in a reasonably sterile environment. Too many juice vendors appear to be (or, frankly, *are*) ""some guy in his garage."" That's not necessarily a bad thing. Post pictures of your mixing area, and your process. Make prospective customers feel more comfortable about ingesting your product.

Now, marketing. **Stop using other companies' trademarks.** Don't use images without adhering to whatever licensing they are covered by. Stop it. If you do this, it will not end well for you, or for the people who will miss you when you're gone. And it makes the whole PV industry look bad.

The first post I read was about vaper's tongue. I hadn't ever heard of that today, despite spending nearly a week of solid research before getting into vaping. Then I just saw another beginner's question about health risks with vaping, and the only thing I saw there was roughly the same as what I see elsewhere - vaping is new and there is not conclusive data on long term health effects, but vaping is most likely totes healthy and fine.

Ok, guys, time to cut the crap. OBVIOUSLY vaping is healthier than analogs, that can be put to rest. But there *are* health impacts and side-effects to vaping, and brushing them under the carpet is only going to come back and bite us in the ass.

Here's what I already know about (in no particular order):

* Dehydration - eLiquids contain PG &amp; VG, which are hygrophylic, and will dry out your mouth and lungs, and ultimately your body if you do not hydrate adequately
* Aforementioned dehydration can lead to kidney stones
* Ingestion of eLiquids can kill children, like that poor girl in Israel
* Nicotine headaches (ranging in severity)
* Vaper's tongue (still not entirely clear what this one is about)

**I'm not trying to fear monger**. I freakin' love vaping now, and I love not smoking analogs anymore. And none of the effects above even compare to the dangers of smoking analogs. I get the impression, though, that there is this fantasy that ecigs and vaping is 100% totally fine. Kidney stones and infant death are really damned serious.

**This community is a hell of a lot better with this than the various forums I've been on.** But even here I get the impression that no one really wants to talk about health issues because it may be damaging to our cause.

I am really interested in a frank discussion of the health issues mentioned above, as well as personal anecdotes re: health, and all things preventative and curative vis-a-vis ecig related health issues. I think health improvements after quitting analogs would be great here as well, even if just as a counterbalance.

**TL;DR: Let's have a frank discussion about health and vaping**

(edit: also, before anyone brings it up - I *have* only been vaping for 2 weeks now, and I'm not going to pretend that I'm on some high horse or that I'm even remotely knowledgeable on these issues. I just want to get this party started, yo.)",,False,self,t5_2qmlu,1370032985.0,,current,True,t3_1ff98g,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1ff98g/can_we_be_honest_about_health_and_sideeffects/,

I see a lot of new vapers are getting Ego-C or Ego-T batteries and kits. They are very attractively priced but an Ego Twist is **significantly better** for just a few dollars more. 

* Fixed voltage Ego batteries like Ego-C or Ego-T deliver a steady 3.7v to the atomizer/cartomizer/clearomizer. A variable voltage Ego battery, like the Ego Twist lets you choose between 3.2v to 4.8v.

* Fixed voltage batteries will affect your vaping experience **negatively**. Sometimes 0.2v is the difference between the perfect warm vape and a burnt vape. If you have an Ego Twist, you can just turn down the voltage where with an Ego C/T you are stuck!

* If you have a fixed voltage battery and get a **Vivi Nova** with it, you will not be able to utilize 2 of the 3 heads that it comes with. With the Ego Twist you can use all three and get almost identical vapes from all of them.

* Atomizers/Cartomizers/Clearomizers lose resistance over time. What might be perfect today might taste burnt tomorrow. If you have an Ego Twist, you can simply dial down the voltage a bit.

* **Even if you don't need variable voltage get the Twist anyway** and just leave it at 3.7v. A Twist can perform like an Ego T/C but not the other way around.

* This is almost 2013. We have **Variable Wattage** PVs now with OLED displays. PVs with built in software and dynamic variable voltage/wattage are in the horizon. RBAs are now affordable and gaining market share.

   Variable voltage is the bare minimum requirement for a PV now. **VV is no longer a luxury, it's a necessity.**

-------------------------

##Atomizers and You

So you are a new vaper and you keep reading Boba's this and Vivi Nova that! You want to get in on the action and get all the things everybody is raving about.

**STOP**. 

Let's clear out a few things first.

Let's say you get 7-8 juice and 2-3 Kanger T2s and a Vivi Nova. **You have more variety of juice than accessories to vape with.**

Sure you can fill out a T2 with one juice, vape till the tank is empty, rinse and put a new flavor in. What if you absolutely hate the juice and now you have a vivi nova tank full of it?! **There's an easier way of doing things.**

**Get an Atomizer**. 

In short Atomizers let you drip a few drops of liquid into it and vape it straight away. After a few puffs you can drip a few more drops of the same juice *or a new juice* and keep vaping!. This way you can **sample 10 different flavors under 10 minutes**, all without wasting a cartomizer/clearomizer. 

Atomizers are a little harder to work with but once you learn the quirks **nothing else can beat the flavor**. [Watch this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3oS7Lao8ds)

What I'd say is get a few bottles of juice, a good atomizer ( [^this ^is ^at ^pretty ^good ^one](http://www.gotvapes.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=68_65&amp;products_id=818&amp;zenid=8864642ded9a30f5ecf75f584018d7da)) some cartomizers, clearomizers and may be even a Vivi Nova.

Sample all the juice first in the atomizer. If you really like a juice then fill up a T2 with it so you can take it everywhere. If you really really like it you can fill up a Vivi Nova with it so you won't have to fill up as often.

Don't forget to get drip tips for atomizers and cartomizers.

-------------------------

##Cartomizer Tanks

**You don't need one**. Before you go out and buy tanks make sure you like cartos first. A carto tank is simply a reservoir that keeps feeding the juice in the cartomizer so you don't have to fill it up manually. 

A regular sized cartomizer should last you an entire day. An XXL one lasts even longer. A carto tank is not a necessity. 

**Instead try a wide vareity of cartomizers**. They are many different ones and they work differently. Some good ones include Boge, Smoktech, Smoktech 1.7 Resurrectors, Ikenvape LR Fusion and Kanger Vertical Coil cartos. Get a few of each, fill them up and see which one you like the best.

Get a tank only when you know you want to vape cartomizers all day. 

-------------------------

That's all for now! Keep vaping and keep trying new juice!

-------------------------

##Edit 1

* Turns out the real world regulated voltage of the Ego C/T is around 3.2-3.5v. They advertise 3.7v but that's not what they deliver. 

* A carto will probably not last you an entire day.

* A lot of you are pointing out that a fresh unregulated battery on a LR atomizer is better. Sure that may be but this was geared towards somebody who is just starting out.

   Vivi Novas and Clearomizers are often suggested to newbies and they buy them too. A VV device would let them fine **tune their vape** and help them utilize all 3 heads of a Vivi Nova.

I've seen some pictures on the internet of people using fancy e-cigs and I always like any technology looking stuff.

I went to all the smoke shops and headshops in my city, but they either had blu's or the wrong kind of vaporizer I was looking for (/r/trees).

I ended up just getting some cheap cig-a-like and I hated how it didn't feel at all satisfying. 

I looked up vape store in *my city* and found out there was one right by my house! It was a sunday and they opened the next day at 10am. 

I head out there before my 11 o clock class and immediately I knew I was going to spend some money that day. 

He had the basic stuff, egos some vivi novas, and samples of juice laid out on tables where you can sit down and sample the juices. 

I bought a double starter kit for me and my girlfriend and redbull juice/sweet tarts. He is way overpriced now that I look back, but it turned out that that was actually his first day open and I was his first customer ever! His credit card machine wasn't even working yet so I bought $90 worth of stuff for $50 since that was all I had on me. 

Within two weeks I became a vaping monster. I vaped everywhere. School, in the car, work, restaurants. No one had really seen anything like that before in my city because it's fairly small (60,000ish). In those two weeks I bought a 650mah battery, several tanks, an ego twist, a ton of juice, and an MVP. I am about this life. 

I posted [THIS](http://imgur.com/e8AFdrK) picture on facebook/tumblr/twitter/instagram. I have quite a few followers because I used to be in a band/I am a social media marketer for my job/make instrumentals for local hip hop artists/photograph for the surrounding areas bands at shows. Within an hour people were messaging and commenting on what the fuck I'm smoking and how cool it looks where they can get one. I converted about 12 smokers in my college classes and online. 

Fast forward to today and now I frequently see people my age that post pictures on the internet of their egos and clearos in my area and people always message me asking for advice like I know everything which I am far from.

It's really nice seeing a whole bunch of people quit smoking and going out to parties and multiple people are vaping. I still like going to restaurant bars and baffling the bartender and have them try some honey pearry or peach rings on the spot and seeing their reaction. 

Another marketing success! ಠ‿ಠ

I've been a 1-1.5 PAD smoker for 10 years. My first experiment with eCigs was about a year ago with a blu. It was okay, but really didn't cut it. I picked up an eGo C starter kit about 6 months ago, used it sporadically at best and didn't really see what all the fuss was about.

Last month, I started a new job with an aggressive anti-smoking policy and my best friend had a kid. Seemed like making a move towards quitting would be smart so I picked my ego back up.

This go 'round, I've really enjoyed vaping. It's fun, soothing, tasty and finding this subreddit made me realize just how much I could geek out over it. I've continued smoking thus far, but cut down to 3 or 4 a day (maybe a couple more on the weekends).

Last night, my gf asked if she could take a few of my cigarettes to work. I told her to take the pack. No bedtime smoke. This morning, I made it all the way to Starbucks before realizing I hadn't had my morning cigarette (usually the second thing I do in the morning). I ordered my coffee, went outside, lit up.... and made it through three puffs before I couldn't handle how gross it was.


The pack is still sitting in my bag next to me, but I think I might be done. Not going to beat myself up if I'm not, but I was so fracking excited that I wanted to share with you guys.

1376583823.0,96,self.electronic_cigarette,1kfd4t,About FastTech,117,21,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1kfd4t/about_fasttech/,"To start off this post, I'd like to state that we've been doing a great job at keeping up with FastTech's new merchandise, and it's good to see that there are a lot of great deals popping up.

I've been reading a lot of posts and comments from new vapers, and there's definitely a trend. A lot of it negative, some of it toxic to the community. I'll do my best to discuss what FastTech offers as a supplier, and welcome other redditors to chime in and contribute to this list.


**FastTech (is):**

* Very cheap -  a great place to shop for vaping supplies if you're strapped for cash or want to try out a new setup. They have a lot of starter kits and cheap setups for new vapers.
* Supplies a lot of imitation hardware, with occasional genuine articles.
* A good place to find cheap mechanical mods, Li-Ion battery chargers, and RBAs/RDAs. (Nitecore Chargers are great!)
* An international supplier that takes 8-20 days to ship (as stated in check-out).
* One of the best places to grab cheap carto tanks, drip tips, Protank 2s, and (apparently now) VW devices with a working flashlight (TBD). Read the reviews/discussion if you're curious about a particular product!
* Carries Pyrex tanks! These tanks won't crack, no matter what juices you throw in them! At ~$5, it's probably the cheapest Pyrex tank you can find in the market (thanks to /u/EcrThrowaway).
* Great place to throw in some headphones, USB cables, and phone cases with your order.

**FastTech (should NOT/is NOT):**

* Be linked to in vendor/classified posts. Sellers are well aware of market value. If you don't think the deal is that great, downvote and move along. Disclaimer: *There's a difference between showing a new vaper a cheaper setup and hijacking a thread.*
* In the United States. Everything ships from Hong Kong.
* The fastest supplier. [Your package crosses the largest body of water in the world](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=united+states+to+hong+kong&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl). It may take a while. Like any other supplier, you have to contact customer service if you have an issue with your order. Posting about your experiences on reddit will get you almost nowhere. Yeah, you're letting the subreddit know that you've had a bad experience - but anyone who can google and use the sidebar search bar can read about those experiences.
* The best place to buy mod batteries aside from the Panasonic CGR18650CHs, NCR18650PDs, and the 30A 18650 Sonys (thanks to /u/overachiever and /u/frogsandstuff).
* A supplier of ""quality"" juice. It may be cheap, but you can't be sure of what is in it. There are some diamonds in the rough, but do your research all the same.
* The best place to grab replacement coils or cartomizers. Google and sidebar searches will yield mixed results for this. Some people receive genuine equipment, whereas some people get knock-offs.
* The best place to find ""high end mods"". The term ""high end mods"" in itself is speculative depending on the mod, because sometimes ridiculous markups with selling and (especially) resale occur. 
* A B&amp;M or online supplier WITH a direct name/face/number to contact in case you have an issue. You can't call up someone from FastTech and ask their personal opinion about the product you're about to order, nor can you ask for their recommendations for future orders.

**Bottom line: As with any supplier, do your research on the product. On the FastTech product page you should read reviews and read the discussion section.**


While redditor's results may vary, I've had nothing but good experiences with FastTech. Some orders have taken 7 days (California), and some orders have taken 21. I've even received an e-mail once notifying me of a shipping delay because of the manufacturer. Once the package is put into tracking, you know your supplies are either coming or being held up in customs.

Furthermore, I'd like to offer my humble opinion, which is in no way a discourse against FastTech: If it is at all possible to purchase something for **roughly the same price** from a U.S. supplier, please do so. (DISCLAIMER: Not necessarily your B&amp;M. Online retailers work, too!) You're helping the growth of the e-cig industry here in the US (even if your supplier gets their orders from overseas). Yeah, you can grab a pack of carto tanks for a couple bucks cheaper, but you won't get that smiley face and random complimentary drip tip from your regular supplier.

We're talking about money, I know, but some supplies are worth the extra buck. You have to do your own research on that specific product. Buying from a U.S. retailer means your money/package stays within the CONUS, and you won't have to worry about your Protank 2 being stuck on a tropical island with a volleyball and Tom Hanks.

#I've really been enjoying the growth of the pics thread over the last few days.  I think it's headed in the right direction and will be an awesome place to check out everybody's gear as the thread's popularity grows.  I feel like the quality and variety of our front page has improved as well.  I support /u/smallchanger and everything he's trying to do with this place.

It really ground my gears to see [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1e5j2y/so_we_cant_view_electronic_cigarette_if_we/) pop up a few hours ago.  Saboteurs are among us.  

In an effort to counteract the haters, I've decided to turn tomorrow's Daily Vape Pics Thread into a [ProVari](http://www.provape.com/provari-variable-voltage-ecig-s/36.htm) contest.  The winner can choose either the ProVari or ProVari Mini - In any color (mod and LED) they choose.

To enter the contest, all you need to do is post a pic in tomorrow's thread.  Original pics that are vaping related are what I'm looking for.  The normal types of pics that would be posted in the thread anyway.  Up/Down votes won't matter.  I'm planning to take everyone's username and put it into some type of random picker website (or something along those lines).  

The winner will need to be 18 or older.  I am in the US, but I'll entertain the idea of international shipping.  Basically, if it is going to be crazy expensive or complicated to ship to an international winner, I reserve the right to renege and give it to someone else.  I'll do my best before it comes to that, though.

The fact is, juice is a complex blend of different elements and quite often, it's not very good until those different flavors have a chance to meld into a singular, cohesive flavor profile...think about how much better a hearty stew tastes a day or two after it's been sitting in the fridge.  

That being said, here is the process I use for steeping [every juice I receive for review](http://www.VaporRater.com) (unless the vendor specifically requests that the juice be reviewed fresh from the mailbox).

* Upon receipt, every bottle is opened, old air is squeezed out, new air enters.
* The bottle then goes into the steeping drawer (cap on), in the order they were received so that I can better keep track of what's next for review.
* Every day (sometimes every other day, as I do tend to get busy) the bottles are shaken, opened, and given another light squeeze to allow more fresh air into the bottle. 
* This process continues with every bottle until it is ready for review, usually 3-4 weeks.
* I have also recently begun giving every bottle a single night, in the drawer, uncapped, just before review to help dissipate any of the volatile perfume-y/floral notes that some juices (pomegranate, blackberry to name a few) are burdened with.
* If at that point, when I sit down with the juice to begin the review, it still doesn't taste right, I will occasionally attempt a hot water bath (sometimes even two) to see if there is any difference in flavor...to date, this has had no effect on bottles that have already been properly steeped. 

I know there are many other methods (i.e. hot rice), but this is my method, and it works. I am hopeful that it will help out a few people who can't understand why everyone goes crazy for something like Indigo's tobacco flavors, when all they taste is hot gasoline and burning tree bark.",Tutorial,False,self,t5_2qmlu,1366048418.0,tutorial,current,True,t3_1ced9h,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1ced9h/the_art_of_the_steep_or_why_your_juice_doesnt/,

So I went in today, armed with all of your advice and information and resources.

I did not get called in by management, but I was approached by my Union Steward.

I really didn't give him an opportunity to tell me that I can't use the vape on property.

I explained that since California, and the cities I ~~~live~~~ work in, have no laws or regulations that include vaporizers in their anti-smoking legislation, that it then falls to the policies of the place of use.

In this case, my workplace.

And since the policy specifically states, no smoking and no tobacco use, and that my device is medical-grade and falls under neither category, that I am not in the wrong and until it becomes policy, to include vapes in their prohibition, that by law, I am able to continue it's use whenever and wherever I please.

He said the he will convey my concerns and arguments to management and HR, that my arguments were strong, very well formulated, constructed and researched and he would be getting back to me.

Until further notice, I am able to vape in peace. But in all likelyhood, HR is going to rule against me.

I fell in love the second i took a whiff from these bottles even before i vaped any of them. vaping them i ended with an orgasm. I vowed not to share any of that precious juice, even with my best friend whom i always share whatever juice i have.

Any who, we get there and i had to use the bathroom, along the way I saw a guy with a measly clearomizer and he seemed to be struggling with his vape. So i asked him what flavor he was vaping, he said melon flavor, and then he said that he just got it 2 days ago. I told him to stay put and i will be right back. I went and grabbed my vape kit which i carry with me, first thing i did was give him my [SETUP](http://i.imgur.com/TQbrnrb.jpg) to vape some of the honey perry that i have, his eyes just bolted out of his face. Then i proceeded to lecture him on what he needs to get to make his vaping experience more enjoyable. By the end of it i had three of his friends towering over me asking me all sorts of questions, and i answered every single one of them. But i always made sure to tell them that all they need to remember is /r/electronic_cigarette, i mentioned that more than i can remember.
And before i left i cleaned his clearomizer and filled it up with some honey perry. The amount of thank yous where overwhelming. I felt good doing what i did.

But that did not end there; i ended up filling two more clearomizers for two totally different strangers. And i also handed out the vapor chef's buisness cards to them. Hey chef, send out more cards next time.

I really feel great for showing others that there are far better things out there and all they have to do is look for it. I hope i made a difference in their vaping experience. Yes I’m a 3rd of honey perry less but it felt good showing others the light.

My personal stance on vaporizers is that they're not tobacco products. Nicotine does not equal tobacco anymore than caffeine equals coffee.

As such I try to distance myself from using the term ""Ecig"" or anything cigarette related. In current product development I'm even pushing my form factors away from tubular just to avoid the relation. I want this to be a 'new' product category just as it deserves to be. 

The other issue is 'vapes' tend to get quickly associated with THC vaporizers and I'm not going to get into the discussion of legality or where it is, isn't or should be, in a lot of places that's still an illegal substance and I'd like to attempt to differentiate from that as well. 

PV's has become a pretty common term. I'm going to be moving to NV and NVS for nicotine vaporizer and nicotine vaporizer system. I feel it's more specific, more accurate, and distances itself from damaging associations. 

I'm not tryin to shake things up or go nuts or anything but I am going to sorta campaign for the new terminology because I feel it helps our case. If you guys adopt it and use it in other communities hopefully it'll catch on. If not, I'll just be the one weird guy calling a shovel a spade. :p

1375040877.0,87,self.electronic_cigarette,1j8bki,Is your juice great? Good? Good enough? And is Vendor X worth the asking price?!?,116,29,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1j8bki/is_your_juice_great_good_good_enough_and_is/,"As is usually the case when I get to writing one of these little info posts, this ain't gonna be short, but I'll get right to main point which is this:

**If you're buying from a reliable source, and it's keeping you away from the analogs, your juice is good enough.** That is the overall goal here.

I often see new vapers asking is XYZ vendor's juice really worth the price, so the question is, what separates mediocre juice from great juice, and great juice from something that it truly out of this world?

The answer is actually pretty complex.

### The Base

People often ask, isn't all PG or VG the same? The answer is no, no it's not. It's all similar, but PG is usually 99.5-99.8% pure. It may seem small, but the .2-.5% can greatly affect the final flavor profile of a juice...particularly those that are more mellow in the flavor department. If a vendor like AiV, for example, were using lower grade PG (or VG), you would taste the impurities to a greater extent, as they tend to be less heavy handed with the flavoring.

Like the PG, VG is never 100% pure, regardless of what the labeling might say. 99.9% is the best you can hope for, but equally important is the source. VG can be extracted from a variety of sources and the source can affect the overall flavor (or lack thereof) of the final product. 

Many vendors, or rather the higher end vendors, have spent months experimenting with different suppliers for their base liquids and have found what works best for their juice. This R&amp;D costs money, and that cost is passed on to us, the consumer. So while the profit margin may seem higher from these boutique/gourmet vendors, compared to what it might cost you to make a similar bottle in your kitchen, the recipes were often months (or years) in the making, with many failed experiments being disposed of.

### The Nicotine

Like the base or carrier liquids, not all nic is created equal. It starts as an extract, usually around 99.5-99.8% pure, and yes, it's extracted from tobacco plants. The lower the purity of the nic, the greater the peppery taste many 24-36mg/ml vapers are familiar with. 

That extract is then dissolved into a solution of PG/VG or a combination thereof. So not only does the quality of nicotine differ from supplier to supplier, so does the base liquid that nicotine is dissolved into, adding further variables into the equation. A supplier selling incredibly pure nicotine, let's say 99.8% pure, who uses a lower end carrier solution to dilute it down to 100mg/ml is doing themselves, their vendor customers, and ultimately us, a tremendous disservice.

### The Flavor

Now that a vendor has found an immaculately clean tasting base, and remarkably pure nicotine to dilute into it...now comes the really hard part, the part that makes this all so worthwhile, the flavoring. 

With dozens of flavor houses to choose from, many offering several incarnations and variations of a specific flavor, it takes a skilled hand (and seemingly endless trial and error) to blend these into a singular, cohesive profile. Most (if not all) of the gourmet vendors have spent months, some have spent years, perfecting these flavors combinations. 

Chocolate is a great example. A vendor who makes a chocolate using a single chocolate flavoring compound is going to end up with a juice that tastes flat, one-noted, and in all likelihood quite artificial in  nature. It takes a blend of several chocolate components, plus secondary elements, many of which the vaper can't actually taste, to create a well-balanced, tasty chocolate e-liquid. Additions like coffee, marshmallow, sweeteners, nutty elements, etc....these are the things that make a really great juice, and even a spectacular one.

### The Facility

Ever wonder where that juice you're vaping was made? Maybe in a lab, under clean room conditions? Maybe...or maybe it was made in someone's kitchen. The fact is, unless you've seen pictures that verify where your juice was made, there is no way to know for sure, and even then we can't know that those pictures weren't staged. 

If you're concerned, ask your favorite vendors for a picture of their mixing facilities and make sure you're not paying $1/ml, or even 20¢/ml, for bathtub juice. At the very least they should have lab equipment, a clean stainless steel table (or other non-porous material i.e. granite, glass) in a room dedicated to mixing, and proper safety equipment close by, of course.

### So...

Is your juice good? If it keeps you off the analogs than it's good enough. 

Do you find yourself wishing it tasted better, and want to know if a vendor is worth their asking price? Ask around, check out some juice reviews ([my site is as good a place to start as any](http://www.VaporRater.com)], or just splurge on a sampler pack and see for yourself.

1366175967.0,90,self.electronic_cigarette,1cil2s,Challenging the legality of e-cig bans,97,7,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1cil2s/challenging_the_legality_of_ecig_bans/,"Greetings, fellow vapers!

I'm a law student, and one of the classes I'm taking this semester is Civil Rights Litigation. For this class, we got to create our own legal controversy, write a brief in support of our side, and give oral arguments before the ""court,"" consisting of our fellow students and our professor. I chose to challenge the University of Kentucky's inclusion of e-cigs in their on-campus smoking ban. I did my oral arguments tonight and won!

Now obviously, this moot-court exercise decided by my peers and professor has absolutely no legal force. However, the arguments I made could be used to mount a proper challenge to such bans. Here are my basic arguments. I apologize in advance; this may run long and there won't be a tl;dr version.

A - The ban on e-cigs should be overturned under public forum analysis.

1) Banning the use of electronic cigarettes implicates freedom of speech.

* School policy-makers have stated that e-cigs should be banned, even if they're not dangerous, because they ""re-normalize"" smoking.

* This shows that the school's motivation is to target expressive conduct because of the message that conduct sends.

* If conduct is sufficiently expressive to be *regulated* as speech, then it is sufficiently expressive to be *protected* as speech.

2) The school's restriction on expressive conduct does not pass scrutiny under public forum analysis.

* With respect to persons with a right to be there (e.g., students), a university campus is a traditional public forum.

* Government actors can only restrict expressive conduct when the restrictions are reasonable as to time, place, and manner; content-neutral; narrowly-tailored to serve a significant government interest; and leave open ample alternative means of expression.

* The e-cig ban fails all prongs of this test: it extends to the entire campus and makes no attempt at being reasonable as to time/place/manner; it specifically targets the content of a particular type of expression (re-normalizing smoking) and therefore is not content-neutral; it is not narrowly-tailored to achieve the government's interest in protecting the public from environmental tobacco smoke (there is none with e-cigs); and because the ban extends to all campus areas, indoor and outdoor, including inside students' own personal vehicles, it does not leave open ample alternative channels for communication.

**I should note that, while my professor found the above argument somewhat compelling, my fellow students didn't buy it. And they have precedent on their side; at least one federal District Court (SDNY) has held that smoking cigarettes is not a sufficiently expressive act to be protected as speech.**

B - Banning e-cigs is arbitrary and capricious, and therefore fails even the lowest level of judicial scrutiny.

1) Citizens are protected from rules, regulations, and legislation which are arbitrary and capricious, a legal term of art meaning unsupported by facts and evidence.

2) Because the University is not a legislature or other deliberative or representative body, the Court should afford it somewhat less deference than a legislature and be willing to look into the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a policy.

3) The ban on e-cigs is not supported by the evidence.

* There is no evidence which suggests that environmental e-cig vapor is harmful; in fact, the opposite is true.

* Study by Consulting for Health, Air, Nature, and a Greener Environment (CHANGE) found “no apparent risk to human health from e-cigarette emissions.” No chemical in any tested sample exceeded cancer or non-cancer risk limits for children or adults.

* Studies relied on by the University do not support a finding of harm from environmental vapor. In fact, the study--cited in UK's [policy paper](http://www.mc.uky.edu/tobaccopolicy/KCSP/OnePagers/One%20pager%20e-cig%20REVISED%202%20FINAL%20030712.pdf) (**pdf warning**)--by Dr. Laugesen explicitly states, “Lacking any active ingredient or any gaseous products of combustion, the [propylene glycol] mist or ‘smoke’ is not harmful to bystanders.”

* Dr. Laugesen said, of the CHANGE study, ""The results of this study confirm the findings of my last 4 years of research: electronic cigarettes pose no discernible risk to public health.""

* Study cited by UK for the proposition that nicotine is present in vapor explicitly says that over 98% of nicotine is absorbed immediately on inhalation, so environmental nicotine would be negligible.

* Propylene glycol is rated Generally Regarded As Safe by the FDA.

4) Even if the chemicals listed in UK's policy paper are present in e-cig cartridges or vapor, it is still arbitrary to ban the devices for that reason.

* The same chemicals are found in various nicotine replacement products, including the patch and gum, which are offered for free by the University to students.

* The University's theater department has a number of theatrical fog machines which produce a smoke-like vapor using propylene glycol. These fog machines are typically used indoors on campus.

**This second argument got more traction. After I answered all their questions, my professor and classmates voted unanimously to strike down the smoking ban (or at least the inclusion of e-cigs) as arbitrary and capricious!**

Again, sorry for the wall of text; my hope is that this might be the outline of a sufficient challenge to e-cig bans, at least in some contexts.

---

Hey there /r/ecr!

I'm still relatively new to the vaping scene (bought my first setup about a month ago) and I'm a ""serial hobbyist"". I feel like that should be my opener at some sort of group help meeting.

Whenever I find a new interest, I tend to think about cool website ideas that I could jump on and develop to enhance the communities that I ultimately would love to be a part of. I've focused on my [gaming](http://d3up.com) [hobbies](http://r2-db.com) for the past 5 years, but I wanted to see if maybe I could branch out into the vaping scene. 

So where did this idea come from? I've already tried over a dozen juices and needed someplace to keep track of what I like! I was tempted to build a spreadsheet to track it, but instead, I decided to sprint on a prototype for the past 2 evenings. 

The result of this programming sprint is: [JuiceDB.com](http://juicedb.com).

It's a site designed to provide you with a place to keep track of what juices you like, and optionally rate/review the flavor itself. Remember, this things a prototype, and there's probably a few bugs.

Currently on the site you can...

- **Login/Signup for an account**:  No email required, just a username and a password. You won't be able to use the 'Forgot Password' if you don't fill out the email though. Passwords are salted/hashed for security, though I wouldn't recommend using the password for your bank account. 
- **Manage your favorite Juices and Vendors**: The ""My Favorites"" page keeps track of every Vendor and Flavor you've added to it, along with links to quickly hit the vendor's website.
- **Add your favorite Juice Vendors**: Select a vendor from the [vendor list](http://juicedb.com/vendors) or create a new vendor to have it added to the list (after approval). 
- **Add your favorite Juices**: Select a juice from the [juice list](http://juicedb.com/juices) or create a new juice to have it added to the list (after approval). 
- **Rate/Review 1-10 all Juices/Vendors**: Right now all it does is keeps this in your ""Favorites"" area, but eventually it might aggregate this data to create a ""Top Vendors/Juices"" list. It's completely optional if you want to rate or review a juice or vendor, you can leave them empty to just add them to your favorites list.
- **All Vendors/Juices are moderated**: Every time a new Juice or Vendor is created, it enters a moderation queue and needs to be approved before it shows up on the list. You can however use un-approved Juices/Vendors in your favorites!

The interface workflow isn't perfect yet... sometimes you're going to submit something and wonder ""why the hell did it send me to this page?"". As soon as people start putting juices and vendors in, the dropdown menu's are going to get massive as well... I'll get around to perfecting the workflow and interface as time moves along and if there's enough interest. 

I'd love to know what /r/ecr thinks about a tool like this. If the community wants/needs something like this, I'll try to set some time aside to improve and develop the site. If not, oh well, it was about 8 hours of my life to create some good portfolio materials ;)

1369614634.0,81,self.electronic_cigarette,1f3y9v,Here's an E-cig glossary of terms!,95,14,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1f3y9v/heres_an_ecig_glossary_of_terms/,"If there are any new ones or any that aren't listed, please define them and we can add to the list.


Numbers:

306 – One of many styles of electronic cigarettes available. Many users of the 510 e-cigs are using the 306 atomizers on their batteries, as they feel it gives a better experience.

401, 402, and 403 – Also referred to as m401, m402, and m403. One of many styles of electronic cigarettes available. These are all essentially the same unit (same threading on batteries and atomizers) but with different length batteries. The 401 model is the longest in physical length and battery life of the three while the 403 is the shortest in length and battery life.

510 – Arguably the most common and popular style of electronic cigarettes available.

808 or KR808 - One of many styles of electronic cigarettes available.

901 – One of many styles of electronic cigarettes available.

A

Adapter – Used to allow a specific style of atomizer or cartomizer to fit onto a different style of battery. Many users prefer the vapor production of one style of atty but prefer the battery life of another style battery. This allows them to have access to both simultaneously.

Analog or Analogue – Slang term for a traditional cigarette.

Atomizer (Abbreviated as Atty) - The part of an e-cigarette that actually heats the juice to the point of vaporization.

Atty – Abbreviation for Atomizer.

Automatic – A style of electronic cigarette battery that does not have a button to activate the heating element. Rather, when the user draws on the device a switch is activated and the atomizer is activated. This style of e-cig is most like smoking a traditional cigarette.

B

Batt – Abbreviation for Battery.

Battery (Abbreviated as Batt) – The battery piece of an electronic cigarette is the part that provides power to the heating element. This allows the heating element to heat the Juice and produce vapor.

Bridge – A small U-shaped covering inside of the atomizer. This is used to absorb liquid and help wick it towards the heating element.

C

Cartridge (Abbreviated as Cart) – A plastic tube-like piece that is usually stuffed with some sort of absorbent filler material that holds the juice.

Cart – Abbreviation for Cartridge.

Carto – Abbreviation for Cartomizer.

Cartomizer (Abbreviated as Carto) – A cartridge and atomizer in a single unit. These generally are disposable, inexpensive and hold more juice than a regular cartridge/atomizer combination.

Charger – A battery charger. This is used to recharge your e-cig battery once it has been depleted.

D

Drip Tip – An accessory that can be used in conjunction with an atomizer or cartomizer. These have a larger opening than the original equipment and allows a user to drip Juice directly onto the atomizer. Some people use a drip tip on their Cartomizers simply for looks and/or comfort.

Dripping – A method of adding juice to the atomizer. A user will drip a few drop directly onto the bridge before vaping. Many users feel this method produces the best vapor production and taste, since there is no filler material involved with the process.

E

E-Cig – Abbreviation for Electronic Cigarette.

E-Juice – Also referred to as E-Liquid, Juice, or Smoke Juice. This is the liquid that is vaporized when using an electronic cigarette.

E-Liquid – Also referred to as E-Juice, Juice, or Smoke Juice. This is the liquid that is vaporized when using an electronic cigarette.


eGo - A style of electronic cigarette that utilizes the 510 threads and allows one to use 510 components but with a much larger battery. Many people feel this is one of the superior models of e-cigs that are available.

Electronic Cigarette (Abbreviated as E-Cig) – A device that heats up a liquid solution consisting of nicotine, propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycol, and flavorings to a point where it actually turns into a vapor which can be inhaled. For more detailed information, click here: Understanding E-Cigs: A Beginner’s Guide

F

FDA - Abbreviation for the (United States) Food and Drug Administration.

Filler Material (Abbreviated as Filler) - Material placed inside of a Cartridge that is absorbent. It is used to help keep the juice inside of the cartridge and deliver it to the atomizer at an optimal pace (so as to not flood the device). Most cartridges come with PolyFill being used as the Filler Material, but there are many modifications available that may help enhance your e-cig experience (such as the Pyramid Tea Bag mod or Blue Foam mod – check our Modifications section for more information).

Flooding – Something that can occur when too much Juice is applied to the atomizer. Since atomizers require some air to properly vaporize Liquid, adding too much Juice to an atomizer will cause a decrease in Vapor Production and flavor.

Food and Drug Administration (Abbreviated as FDA) – An administrative branch of the United States government that oversees rules and regulations pertaining to the safety of food and drug products sold in the USA. There is currently a very controversial lawsuit involving the FDA and the importation and distribution of electronic cigarettes.

G

H

Hot Cigarette – A slang term for a traditional cigarette.

I

J

Juice – Also referred to as E-Liquid, E-Juice, or Smoke Juice. This is the liquid that is vaporized when using an electronic cigarette.

K

L

Leaking – This can happen when too much Juice is added to an atomizer or cartomizer. Juice can leak out of the bottom of the heating element and onto the battery, which in some cases can cause damage to the device (as is the case with Automatic Batteries).

LED - Abbreviation for Light Emitting Diode.

Light Emitting Diode (Abbreviated as LED) – A diode that converts applied voltage to light. These are commonly used in electronic cigarette devices to indicate that the device is actively being used.

Liquid – Also referred to as E-Liquid, E-Juice, Smoke Juice, or Juice. This is the liquid that is vaporized when using an electronic cigarette.

Low Resistance (Abbreviated as LR) – An atomizer or cartomizer with a lower Ohm rating than the standard equipment. This generally causes the heating element to get hotter faster and produces vapor more quickly. In many cases it produces more vapor than an atty or carto that has a standard resistance rating.

LR - Abbreviation for Low Resistance.

M

m401, m402, and m403 – Also referred to as 401, 402, and 403. One of many styles of electronic cigarettes available. These are all essentially the same unit (same threading on batteries and atomizers) but with different length batteries. The m401 model is the longest in physical length and battery life of the three while the m403 is the shortest in length and battery life.

Manual – A style of electronic cigarette battery that has a button (usually on the top or side of the battery) that activates the heating element. When the user wishes to use the device, the button must first be depressed in order to produce vapor from the atomizer. This style of e-cig is less like a traditional cigarette than the Automatic, but is preferred by many due to the fact that it is sealed and can not be adversely affected by Leaking.

mg – Abbreviation for Milligrams.

Milligrams (Abbreviated as mg) – The amount of nicotine found in a Juice. Typical levels include 0mg, 6mg, 8mg, 12mg, 16mg, 18mg, 24mg, 30mg, 36mg and 48mg. Generally speaking, a medium level of nicotine is around 18mg. Those who use Juice with a higher nicotine content than that are generally people who were heavy smokers or have been vaping for quite some time.

Milliliters (Abbreviated as mL) – The amount of Juice in a given container.

Mini – One of many styles of electronic cigarettes available. These generally are about the same size as a traditional cigarette and have the shortest battery life of any style.

mL - Abbreviation for Milliliters.

Mod – Dual usage – Can be used to describe modifications to a device or accessory (such as getting more vapor production out of your cartridges) or a design variation of a commonly manufactured electronic cigarette. In the latter context, mods typically use larger rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries and allow the user longer battery life and increased vapor production but at the cost of the device looking like a traditional cigarette. Many mods will also allow the user to increase or decrease the voltage of their device to achieve optimal performance.

N

O

Ohm - A measure of electrical resistance. A lower number indicates lower resistance and therefore faster heating.

P

Passthrough – A device that plugs directly into the USB port of a computer or charger and allows the user to vape without having to worry about battery life. Some users report better vapor production and/or flavor while using a Passthrough compared to their regular batteries.

PCC - Abbreviation for Personal Charging Case.

Pen Style – One of many styles of electronic cigarettes available. Slightly resembles a ball point pen in appearance.

Personal Charging Case – A portable charger that can be taken with a user on the go to charge electronic cigarette batteries when away from a power outlet. Particularly useful when using an e-cig that has less than a 2 hour battery life per charge. Take a look at this post for battery life information for many common e-cig batteries.

Personal Vaporizor (Abbreviated as PV) – Another name for an Electronic Cigarette. Usually used in reference to the more untraditional style e-cigs (also known as Mods).

PG – Abbreviation for Propylene Glycol.

Propylene Glycol (Abbreviated as PG) – An ingredient found in many brands of E-Juice. Some users have reported an allergic reaction to it and must therefore use 100% VG Juice instead. This is one of the ingredients used that when heated will produce vapor that can be inhaled. Typically, PG produces less vapor than it’s VG counterpart but provides more flavor and Throat Hit. This substance has been used as a primary ingredient in medical inhalers for years.

PV - Abbreviation for Personal Vaporizor.

Q

R

S

Smoke Juice – Also referred to as E-Liquid, Liquid, Juice, or E-Juice. This is the liquid that is vaporized when using an electronic cigarette.

Smokeless Cigarette – A term used to refer to an electronic cigarette. This term is used commonly due to the fact that no actual smoke is inhaled or exhaled while using an e-cig.

Starter Kit – A kit that includes basic e-cigarette equipment. Typically includes everything needed to begin vaping. Most starter kits come with 1 or more atomizers, 1 or more batteries, a charger and 5 cartridges pre-filled with Juice.

T

TH - Abbreviation for Throat Hit.

Throat Hit (Abbreviated as TH) - The tingling feeling one feels in the back of the throat when vaporizing juice that contains nicotine. Typically, since nicotine is a large contributing factor in throat hit, when a juice that contains zero nicotine is vaporized, there is no throat hit.

U

V

Vape – The action of “smoking” an electronic cigarette. Since e-cigs actually produce vapor (rather than smoke) people refer to this as “Vaping”.

Vapor Cigarette – A term used to refer to an electronic cigarette. This term is used commonly due to the water vapor that is exhaled when using an e-cig.

Vapor Production – Typically associated with Juices. Indicates how much vapor is produced using an average inhale of an e-cigarette.

Vegetable Glycerol or Vegetable Glycerin (Abbreviated as VG) – An ingredient found in many brands of E-Juice. This is one of the ingredients used that when heated will produce vapor that can be inhaled. Typically, VG produces more vapor than it’s PG counterpart but provides less flavor and Throat Hit. Some users who are allergic to Propylene Glycol must use 100% VG Juices.

VG - Abbreviation for Vegetable Glycerol or Vegetable Glycerin.

W

Wick – A narrow piece of poly string that is inside of many styles of atomizers that allows easier delivery of Juice to the heating element.

If I had the experience or knowledge to do it, I would. I don't though, but I do understand how the system works. 

Currently we are being proactive on our research and bitching... not so much with the government cog. 

We need block legislation that hurts our industry, I totally agree with that, I only used that topic to catch your eye :p 

We also, more importantly, need to start proposing legislation, we need to get bills INTO state government to be voted on that regulate our industry in a way that is responsible and benign to what we are trying to accomplish. 

Again, I am not an experienced writer of legislation but here are my bullet points. 

I urge you, if you're a vaper or friend of a vaper, or know some one who is friendly to this cause and have the ability... push this concept. Tell your local vape groups... there has to be a lobbyist vaper out there somewhere that can put these things together. If we hit all 50 states boards with proposed legislation and play the game back we have a better chance of 'winning' and setting our own precedent. Here's my bullet points as an extremely rough guide for things we should be doing. 

My 7th point is vaping in public... This point is the one that's going to piss some people off. I love that I can vape a lot of places you can't smoke... but that's not going to fly for long. It IS going to be restricted and as such it should be proposed in a way that is not completely restrictive but still shows some courtesy to 'non vapers'. It's not a health factor as it is an enclosed air space. Personally I think if you can't vape on a train you shoudln't be allowed to get on a train if you haven't bathed recently either.... but, that said, we are going to have to make some concessions if we're going to push through, please understand my stance before you flame... feel free to flame, but at least take my stance into consideration before hand ;) 

1. Ecigarettes (Personal vaporizers) should be categorized as a recreational use product. 

2. E liquids should be clearly labeled and marked with appropriate warnings regarding toxicity and and addictive nature of nicotine.

3. All vaping establishments should be 18+ only as far as admittance (some of you will make a frowny face but this will make legislators smile a bit more).

4. Juice mixing rules (See Aemsa, they got that shit down)

5. Sales of Vaping products should be treated as sales of any other consumer product in regards to taxation. 

6. Online sales of E-liquid will require standard age verification used for other age restricted online content such as applied to adult oriented businesses. 

7. Vaping will not be considered smoking, however, vapeing should be restricted. Vaping in the following locations will be disallowed; Public transportation, including withing 10ft of buss stops or in subway terminals, establishments that prepare and serve food, indoors in retail establishments who's product offerings are less than 70% tobacco or vape related merchandise. vaping may be allowed at the discretion of the owner/operator of other establishments. designating ""vaping areas"" is an acceptable practice in places where smoking is not allowed due to the extremely limited radius of effect that vaping presents and the lack of ""second hand"" health hazards. 

8. E-liquid manufacturers will not make available for consumer purchase any pre-mixed e-liquid for the purposes of direct consumption that exceeds 36mg/ml. 

9. Wholesale of high concentration Nicotine containing liquid must be clearly labeled as ""Dilute before use"" and have all appropriate toxicity and addictive nature labels as previously mentioned.

10. Tobacco related legislation will not apply to E-cigarette use, sales, other applications unless expressly called for in the proposed legislation. 



Take that, add, subtract, whatever... just propose some legislation. Lets get OUR bills out there and instead of having to constantly fight 'against' something, lets have something to show our support.

Nope.  I lit one up and it felt fantastic.  At this point, I've smoked two and put the pack in the glove compartment of my car.

Prior to this snap, I'd been vaping since just after Christmas, so I was about two months without an analogue.  I'd been perfectly fine without them until just recently.  I believe this may have more to do with my equipment rather than my momentary lapse of willpower.  

The biggest problem for me is that I seem to not be getting a strong enough ""throat hit"" to curb my smoking-cravings.  Here's what I'm using:

[The EPower Vaping Kit from CCV](http://www.crystalclearvaping.com/COMPLETE-E-POWER-NOVA-KIT-and-30ml-juice-Free-priority-shipping_p_58.html) &lt;--- this is not the exact kit...they've stopped selling mine for some reason - but it's VERY similar.

Juice-wise, I have a little of everything.  I have flavored juices from Mt. Baker Vapor, Three Pawns  (both fantastic).  Plus, I ordered a ""Wensten"" flavored juice from a seller that I can't recall.  It was supposed to taste like Winston cigs  (my old brand) - it doesn't but it does seem stronger tasting.  Anyway, I'm using the strongest (35mgs) for most of the juices.  So, I don't think it's a lack of nicotine.

Bottom line, I don't think it's the juice.  When I first purchased the kit, I seemed to be getting a much stronger ""hit"".  Now, despite using clean cartridges, trying drip tips, etc., it seems that the kit is just not as strong as it used to be.  I'm noticing that I'm having to change batteries more often.

Could it be that the kit that I have is just not very good?  Is there another that someone might recommend?  I'm still pretty new to this, so any recommendations would be very welcome.

For the record, I've determined to throw out the pack of smokes and get back on the horse...but I worry that I might have cracked an illusion for myself.  I shouldn't have bought that damn pack at all.

For those reading this post you may have seen my many previous posts on this sub asking various questions from before I got my first E-Cig 3 weeks ago, to the various questions afterwards.


First let me introduce myself, my name is Daniel Moore, a local Northern Virginia trash man. I have been smoking since I turned 18. At first I was a stress smoker due to my being a manager, which turned into me being a casual smoker, you know the typical morning, after any meal, after and during work smoker. 

I got engaged to my fiancé 2 summers ago and we had a beautiful baby girl on December 12, 2012 (yes I know 12/12/12). She very much wanted me to quit smoking and as hard as I tried, I just couldn't, nothing worked. We would fight everyday over my smoking, which turned out relationship sour and we eventually stopped kissing, hugging, and anything other than talking and hanging out basically. 

I wanted to quit, believe me I did and ex-smokers can testify how hard it can be, I knew I needed to for my health, for my relationship and for my family.

I was a lurker on this sub for about a month, reading and watching posts come and go before I made a post asking for help on my first order.

Two weeks ago I had my last Camel Crush, received my eGo in the mail and I haven't looked back. If I didn't find you guys I probably would still be sucking ash, I would still be fighting everyday and coming closer to losing my love and my family.

Today, I am noticeably happier, breathing easier, and overall very proud of myself as well as my entire family as a whole of me.

So, /r/electronic_cigarette, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for all your patients with all my (very obviously) annoying questions, thank you for saving my (future) marriage, thank you for helping me be able to watch my little girl grow up and most of all thank you for (possibly) saving my life in more ways than one.

There will be many more posts coming from me with many, many questions as I want to learn so much about this and learn everything there is to know. And I will edit this post in a little bit if there are any formatting errors as I'm on my phone.

Sincerely yours,
Daniel Moore",,False,self,t5_2qmlu,False,,firstvape,True,t3_1jw1t0,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1jw1t0/an_official_2_weeks_you_guys_have_done_more_for/,

Did the e-cigarette help you to quit smoking normal cigarettes?

I’ve heard whispers that people have been concerned about me “smoking in the office” or what looks like smoke, anyhow.
 
What I am using is called an “electronic cigarette” or “personal vaporizer”. The only thing that comes out of it is like water vapor – something like out of a tea kettle.
 
I have been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day since I was 16 years old and I have tried everything to quit, but nothing stuck. When I started vaping (using an electronic cigarette), I quit cold turkey and have not had the urge to smoke a cigarette for weeks, now. This is something that is going to benefit my health – and benefit XXXXXXXXX Corp. from reducing the loss of productivity due to smoke breaks :)
 
These devices work by heating up a mixture of propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, and a small amount of nicotine. They operate similarly to a fog machine, in that they heat up the mixture until it vaporizes. There is no combustion of organic matter involved and therefore no carcinogens released.
 
Electronic cigarettes are legal to use indoors in Canada, legal to use in the workplace. There is absolutely no harm to the air quality in the office from the vapor that comes out of these devices. Basically, there is so little nicotine that comes out of these devices that it produces a statistically insignificant impact on nicotine levels in the air of a small, non-ventilated room. The fact our office is street-level in Toronto has a bigger impact on air quality, since we have all sorts of automotive exhaust left and right. The impact of a personal vaporizer is something akin to putting a drop of food coloring into the ocean.
 
The components of the vapor are propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin. PG has slight anti-bacterial properties and some hospitals inject it into their HVAC systems. Vegetable glycerin is a thicker, ‘vegan’ organic analog of it and both are GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the US FDA, for ingestion and inhalation. Anyhow – the point is – there is no “second hand” concern to worry about.
 
If you are a smoker, or were a smoker and still have cravings, come talk to me for more info. I was honestly amazed how I was able to go from smoking so much tobacco every day to smoking none in the blink of an eye.
 
I apologize that I didn’t tell everyone when I started using this in the office. Not many people know about this nascent technology and I understand why it may ruffle some feathers.
 
If you have any questions, you can always come to me.
 
Thanks for your concern,
 
XXXXXXXXX

Below is the full copy*

*****

Rhode Island and New England vapers,

If you are getting this is it because you live close enough to help
us stop the Rhode Island legislation that would make it very hard for
people in Rhode Island to purchase e-cigarettes online.

 SB 622 is scheduled for a hearing before the Senate Judiciary
Committee on Tuesday, April 9th at 3:30pm

Room 313  
State House  
Providence  
Rhode Island

If you are in or around Rhode Island and can attend or speak at the
hearing, please email us at vapersclub@aol.com or call us at 516 695 7007 and we will let you know how you can help.  

You do not need to speak, but it helps a lot of you can. Just
showing up will make a difference.

(Below is from the CASAA website)

This bill would:  

Ban e-cigarette sales to minors, but would also greatly restrict
online sales of nicotine-containing products by treating e-cigarettes
the same as traditional tobacco products.

 Specifically, the bill would require a retailer conducting an online
sale to: (1) Obtain a copy of the buyer's driver's license; (2) Obtain
a statement from the buyer affirming that they are the person
pictured; and (3) Send the package through a service that checks the
ID of the buyer at delivery. Retailers would be required to perform
this check every time a consumer places an order.

SB 622 would also require e-cigarette retailers in Rhode Island to
obtain a tobacco license and only buy their e-cigarettes from licensed
wholesalers or distributors.

If you cannot attend, or even if you can, please call, write or fax
the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee below

 What to say:

1. You support supports prohibiting the sale of e-cigarettes and
other nicotine-containing products to minors, but do not support SB
622 in its current form.
2. Express your concern about Section 11-9-13.11 of the bill, which
would restrict the online sales of vapor products.
3. Explain that the restrictions would place Rhode Island
e-cigarette vendors at a competitive disadvantage by:  
    * Instituting a system that will impose significant costs for
compliance.  
    * Imposing restrictions on consumers (i.e., requiring signature
confirmed delivery and age/identity proof with every subsequent sale
to the same purchaser) that will cause consumers to purchase their
products from out-of-state vendors.
4. Note that the legislation would also overly burden consumers by
requiring all shipments to repeat customers to be sent via a method
that requires an in-person signature upon delivery. This adds cost and
is inconvenient for those who are not home to receive the delivery.
5. Tell the legislators that restrictions on online sales were
instituted for two reasons: (1) Cigarette companies blatantly marketed
to kids; and (2) Online sales were being used to evade taxes. Because
there is no evidence that a single child has been sold an e-cigarette
online and e-cigarettes are not taxed in Rhode Island, there is no
reason to implement such an onerous provision.
6. Explain that online sales bans only serve to protect the market
share of cigarette companies.

I'm working on launching a rather large socially driven campaign to help distance Vaporizers from Cigarettes or NRTs. It's going to be a positive, but aggressive campaign specifically targeted at public perception and creating as much buzz and essentially positive propaganda as possible on top of educating the general public about vaping. The goal is to end the association with tobacco products and with NRTs. 

A name must be chosen, an acceptable 'term' for our devices that does not make you think of those other two product types. The reasoning being, perception drives people and if it's perceived as a tobacco product we have no hope of getting it regulated as it's OWN product. 

So, I made a quick survey, one question, 2 answers. PV or NV (personal vaporizer, nicotine vaporizer). 

Take the survey, the winner by monday will be the adopted term for the campaign. 

I dont' care what it's called, as long as it's not ""ecig"" or anything 'cig'.

1360290186.0,82,self.electronic_cigarette,183tu1,Ms T's Bakery on Diacetyl,88,6,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/183tu1/ms_ts_bakery_on_diacetyl/,"The whole diacetyl issue shouldn't be too much of a concern anymore. It was a couple of years ago when most (if not all) of the flavoring companies were using it. You see, it provides an excellent buttery flavor. If you have ever had microwave popcorn, you know the flavor. Interestingly, employees at microwave popcorn factories were showing symptoms of a condition later called ""Popcorn Lung"", caused by direct inhalation of large amounts of diacetyl over a long period of time. Since you are asking about it, you probably know that already.

Obviously, a chemical that can do that has no place in e-juice, even if the quantities are so minute that they would probably never present a problem. Back in 2009 before this became a concern, we used flavorings that contained diacetyl (just like everyone else), but most of the flavoring companies (all of the ones we use) removed diacetyl in favor of acetoin. Acetoin was an acceptable replacement for diacetyl in regard to flavor, and does not cause Popcorn Lung. I know some non-American flavoring companies took longer to convert, and I'm not even sure all of them did. We only use American made flavorings, so I'm sorry but I do not have much knowledge about the foreign ones. If there are actually any vendors that still have diacetyl in their juices, there would be a couple of things to remember: First, if they do have it they probably don't know, or haven't even heard of it, so you may not actually find out. Second, if they tell you that they DO contain diacetyl, they clearly have no idea what is safe for e-juice and what isn't or they just don't care. That leads me to the third thing. If you suspect that a vendor is using flavorings with diacetyl, don't use them. The fact that you are asking is good, although like I say, you would probably actually have a hard time finding anyone that has it these days. 

So, to answer your question simply, no, our flavorings do not contain diacetyl. You can even vape our straight Butter flavor to your hearts content without the worry of diacetyl! Thanks for doing your homework though. The next thing you land on might be regarding oil based flavorings. That is a more recent topic, maybe about a year old or so now. I never heard any resolution on this one though. It is theorized that the oils can be difficult for the lungs to metabolize, causing a build up of it inside the lungs. I have absolutely no idea if this is true or not. However, it became a bit of a hot topic for awhile, so we took a look at our flavorings. We found maybe a half a dozen flavors that used oil based flavorings instead of water based, and we decided to immediately remove those flavors from our menu just in case. Unfortunate because the Lemonade flavor we had was the bomb! We do still have some eucalyptus flavors which contain eucalyptus oil. It is a very tiny amount (super strong flavoring), and we have a clear warning in the product description for those who are concerned about oils. Plus, eucalyptus oil is a bit different from some of the other oils used in flavorings, and it has been used as an inhalant, possibly for thousands of years. 

So how's that for a long answer? We have been at this for awhile now, and it is clear that sometimes discoveries are made about ingredients. Since we are all sort of the pioneers of vaping, this is an inevitable consequence. I like to think of it as we are sacrificing for future vapers!

Then, I found this place.

Lurked for a bit. I had no idea.

Today is my two years without analogs.   I'm celebrating more because I found /r/electronic_cigarette two months ago.

I learned about batteries, T3's, dual coil carto tanks. Most importantly -- JUICE.

Just wanted to say thank you.   What great group of people.

Last month I switched from the horrible consumer ecigs to eGo's, clearos and tanks. Changed my world from when I used to cheat from time to time -- never again.

I am really enjoying the eGo T3 Sol Fuego - Bottom Coil Changeable Cartomizers.

I have already ordered a couple of twists and half a dozen more T3's and more juice. 

Thank you /r/electronic_cigarette

At the time, and with few points of comparison, I was pretty impressed by their boutique packaging, their florid product descriptions, and selection of what, although not ADVs, seemed to be stand-out liquids. After that initial experience, I continued to order from competitors, found some truly special recipes and had forgotten about Five Pawns, but continued to cite them among my favorites. Anyhow, I thought I'd order a 30ml bottle of Gambit - my favorite of the bunch - and emailed them to ask if I could also buy a sample of their new Castle Long liquid as well. $27.50 for the 30ml isn't exactly a competitive price, but I was willing to pay it as well as another $8 or so for the sample. 

They responded to tell me that if I purchased two 30ml bottles at $27.50 a piece, they'd sell me a small sample of Long Castle. ""If you would like I can send you an invoice through Paypal for a bottle of Castle Long with a purchase of two bottles or more of our signature line. Let me know how you would like to proceed."" Silly me, I sort of considered it. But first I knew I needed to vape what remained of my initial sample set to confirm that they were as nice as my memory suggested. So I vaped what was left...and then I laughed. Since that initial order I had tried over 100 liquids from other vendors. When I returned to Five Pawns I realized that despite their descriptions, the liquid was neither as one-of-a-kind nor as tasty as I figured at first. In fact, I could find a direct comparison to every one of the lot from competing vendors that were not only cheaper but also superior. And that's when I woke up. Seriously, make me buy two overpriced big bottles in order to earn the privilege to buy a small sample? These guys are clowns. No offense to those who still love them, but I've sworn them off forever and am damned well certain to spread the word to friends who don't visit Reddit but who I've helped take up vaping and put down the analogs.

While it's true to a degree, I believe the words get tossed around and generally interpreted as something other than what they really mean...thus this delightful little rant.



While *taste is subjective*, **flavor is not**. 

To better illustrate my point, let's look at, as an example, Indigo's Capt. Ron. Those of us that have had it can all agree that it's a Banana Tobacco blend with a hint of coconut on the exhale and finish. Those of us with a more discerning palate can tell you it's closer to a candied banana flavor than a natural one. 

No one is going to tell you that Capt Ron tastes like pixie stix or green apple jolly ranchers, because it doesn't. The only thing that's truly subjective **is whether or not YOU happen to like** banana tobacco with a light touch of creamy coconut, thus your personal tastes.

While it's true that certain aspects of a flavor profile may be more pronounced to some vapers than to others, **the actual profile does not change** from person to person. As an example, some vapers despise coconut. To those folks, the coconut may be slightly more pronounced than to someone who adores coconut and wishes there were more of it, but in reality,the ingredients of a juice will always be the ingredients of a juice. 

Another great example is the Boba's that everyone seems to lust after (you should check out eJoose Dead or Alive, if you're one of those people, btw). 

If you were to spend the better part of 8 months reading thru the ECF thread about all the different things that different vapers taste in Boba's, you'd think it has some sort of magical flavor morphing power bestowed upon it by a rainbow riding unicorn. 

In reality, Boba's tastes very differently based on a variety of factors, not the least of which is voltage. The higher the voltage, the stronger the tobacco. Same goes for age...the more Boba's steeps, the more the tobacco presents, as the sweeter flavors move towards the back of the flavor profile. 

That being said, the flavor of a juice is also dependent on the *omizer you happen to be using. Some flavors will taste very different in carto vs a dripping atty, the latter of which presents the truest flavor of the juice.   

The moral here is that yes, to a degree taste is subjective, but a flavor profile consists of facts, even data. The only thing that's truly subjective about taste is whether or not *you* like something...the overall quality, balance, and flavor composition of a particular juice is not open for debate.",,False,self,t5_2qmlu,False,,current,True,t3_1dcux3,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1dcux3/taste_is_subjective_flavor_is_not_dual_warning/,

Phase1:  Data gathering

- everyone will submit a list of flavors that they feel come out of Boba's Bounty - flavors, specific vendors, attempts to re-create this juice in general.  Graham Cracker, Raisin, Tobacco, any flavors we feel we recognize, let's compile.

Phase2:  Recipes

In Phase 2, we will all submit our own recipes/combinations that we feel recreate the Boba's Bounty flavor.  We will also comment on how close each recipe gets, and our own reactions to each recipe of Boba-clone that we have.

Phase3:  Reproduction:

The highest-rated recipes from Phase2 will appear in Phase3, and the community will vote on how close each flavor gets to the real thing.

If you 'can' manufacture and you're interested in the Vaporizer industry... we need you. We need you to NOT open a store... we need you to create products that can be produced in quantities to add to the american market. 

A lot of you know that I'm designing products to go into my store. I'm not a machinist or an electrical engineer even though I play one on the internet. I'm a designer. I create ideas. While my ideas are, generally speaking, viable from a manufacturing standpoint my designs are just that... designs. They need to be refined into manufacturable product.

I get no less than 1 email or call a day from some one who wants to start up a vape store either online or a physical location. I love you, I love that you're wanting to get involved in an industry you're passionate about but I also feel for you... There are a LOT of stores out there. I might come off as being anti-competitive here, but it's not about that... I know my capabilities and competition doesn't bother me, I'm good at that game. I'm more concerned about people chasing a dream that's relatively crowded. 

I'm not sayin 'dont' open a store. By all means, grow the industry... but differentiate yourself. 

This post is more directed towards the folks who 'can' make things. We, as an industry need a chinese alternative. I don't mean something that's got 200 a month being made, it's ok to start there but most of these boutique devices you see are made in limited quantities and never truly scale up to become a ""product"". it's glorified etsy in the ecig world right now and for us to grow that needs to change. 

I will support any viable manufacturing plan. if you're not a designer but you can build things other people design.... let's talk. I listed some professions but honestly... theres room in just about any production category here. 

Wood workers: Stands, device bodies, drip tip sleeves, cases, vape centric furniture (i.e. desk cabinets, etc)

Machinists: This list will go on forever... 

Electrical Engineers: Affordable variable voltage chipsets, protection/limiting circuits for integrated battery cases, advanced vaping hardware, reliable 'electronic' switch assemblies.

Plastic workers: cases, drip tips, battery enclosures, all the stuff the word worker had listed as well. 

Ceramics: Wicks, tips, stands, accessories.


The list goes on and on... if you have the ability to 'make' and especially the ability to make in quantity and want to be involved in the industry then lets talk. 

Hell, I will design a product for you to make and sell to me for my store, I won't even make it exclusive to me so you can sell it to other stores. 

I will HELP you start a manufacturing business by giving you ideas to design and assisting where i can, and providing an outlet for initial sales. The Monkey Labs on my store is specifically designed for test running products to find out if they're viable. 

I will give a list of things that make a product viable for me to carry, this doesn't mean if you can't meet these requirements that you shouldn't move because I""m far from the only vendor that's chomping at the bit to carry an american made (or at the very least, non chinese) product. This is just what it would take for me to  move forward with something. 

1. It's a product that serves a defined need. 

2. Production for the item can be scaled to meet demand if demand increases.

3. The price point is justifiable. A premium is expected when dealing with products built with quality materials by well trained individuals but a 300 dollar mod stand that holds 4 devices is not justifiable. A mechanical mod with a bottom switch and a 510 connector at 400 dollars is not justifiable, a drip tip that retails at 50 dollars... unless it's a goddamn work of art, is not justifiable. :) 

Even if you don't have a product... if you just have a skillset that you'd like to employ, I can help if you can meet the requirements once I give you a product to make. 

This isn't a call out specifically for 'me' but for the industry as a whole. If you can make a thing that is viable in the market, even if it's a rip off of a chinese product, a little more expensive and higher quality.... freakin do it. 

for my 'specific' needs right now I'm looking for people with the following capabilities.

Drip tips: I picked up some captivape drip tips, I love them but I like variety so I'm going to be trying to eliminate all the chinese tips out of my inventory as soon as possible. I need some one who can produce these designs for me in stainless steel and in Delrin. I do not want works of art here, I want mass production capability. I have 15 designs I can pull the trigger on tomorrow and if you can get the price at a point that's viable in the marketplace and produce in the quantity I need, I will start allocating half of my drip tip budget to you almost immediately and eventually 90% of my drip tip budget (10% is gonna keep getting flung at captivape cause the DS tips are awesome)

Injection molded plastic parts: I have a number of projects that will revolve around 'cheaper' alternatives to mech mods I""m launching in the near future. plastic boxes are the answer to that. This would be custom mold work. 

Machinists: I have a shop for my current major projects but I'm looking for another machinst with CNC capability and reasonable pricing for a couple of other projects. Mostly small parts. 

Glass workers: I have 3 projects involving glass, one requires some one with a percussive laser drilling set up, the others are mostly blown mold projects (think glass soda bottles to give you an idea).

Electrical Engineer: I have 3 chipsets I need created. I expect to have to outsource this a bit when it comes to production but if you can design an affordable chipset to do the things I need done I will work with you so that you become my supplier. You design the chipsets, you arrange the production,  you sell the finished chips to me with a reasonable mark up and become my supplier. One of these chipsets I will want exclusive rights to, the other two I'll help with the design and then you can market them to as many vendors as you want.

I want this industry to grow and I want to see innovation. I'm pushing to get out of the garage shop mentality and move into the consumer grade production category with standards, official certifications (UL, ROHS, etc) and proper production and supply chain management. Do it without me or do it with me, just freakin DO it!

First I'd like to note some changes to format. I'm moving this to mondays and I'm moving this to the /r/ecr/ sub based on a LOT of requests that I do so. (formerly I'd been having this in /r/steammonkey/ and just Xposting it the day after). 

Every Monday I'll be posting a different 'University' thread with a goal of creating a 'space' for people to ask questions about a specific topic and those with answers to put em down. 

Post guidelines: If you have a question ask... there are no stupid questions, only stupid answers. If you have an answer, please note whether or not it's your opinion or a fact that you can back up with a credible source, external links to references are AWESOME. 


Now, on to todays topic. How to vape. This is intended to be sort of a newby primer, I'm going to cover some basic concepts, not dip too far into the advanced vaping things like RBAs etc, but that doesn't mean people can't ask those questions. My personal write up is just going to be geared more towards that 'first time' vaper who knows nothing about what's going on aside from ""electronic cigarettes are supposed to be cool"". 


So, what is vaping? In a word? Awesome. In a lot more words...

Vaping is essentially an alternative form of nicotine consumption that closely mimics the most common form of nicotine consumption (smoking) with a great reduction in the number of chemicals and particulate matter going into your lungs. You get your nic by heating a small coil of wire to a point that it will vaporize a nicotine containing liquid that you then inhale and exhale like smoke. The overall experience is VERY similar to smoking. 

To vape you need a few basic things. 

1. Liquid to be vaporized.

2. A coil to do the vaporizing.

3. A method of delivering the liquid to that coil. 

4. A power source for the coil. 

That's it... so why are there so many different permutations of those basic ingredients? It's a lot like mexican food... same 4 ingredients arranged in different configurations for our nomming pleasure ;) I'm going to go forward breaking down those 4 categories (I'll be combining 2 and 3 since they tend to come in a 'package' deal). 



**Liquid to be vaporized.** 

The liquid will be called a lot of things. E-liquid, E-juice, juice, liquid, lung yummies, etc. Usually it'll have some sort of fluid inspired name and it's the only ""liquid"" component in this set up so if you hear some one referring to a fluid of some sort they're probably talking about the nic juice, I'll be referring to it as juice moving forward. 

Juice is comprised of all or some of the following ingredients: nicotine in a liquid base, flavorants, filler.  The liquid bases are vegetable glycerin and propalyne glycol. These two bases are mixed in different ratios based on user preference. The flavorants vary wildly but tend to be scents or flavors used in food and beverage applications elsewhere. The nicotine is just good ol fashion nicotine extracted from tobacco leafs. 

Generally speaking the differences between PG and VG. PG is thinner and provides greater ""throat hit"" or that harshness some people seek out in their vaping experience. I personally feel that PG delivers cleaner flavors and you taste your flavors 'more' with a higher PG concentration. VG is thicker and produces more visible vapor on a draw. A common ""blend"" tends to be somewhere around 70/30 (always PG/VG) though you'll find the gambit if you ask. 

There is a rare but not unhead of PG sensitivity. You could find out that PG does not agree with you. it's pretty uncommon and generally not overtly dangerous unless you ignore the symptoms and chain vape through it. Symptoms include but are not limited to (note, I'm not a doctor) extremely dry mouth and throat, difficulty swallowing, ulceration of the soft tissue in your mouth, sore gums. If you find yourself with a PG sensitivity don't fret... there are a number of manufacturers who make 100% VG liquids. 

Nicotine usually is listed in a ""MG"" strength. This stands for milligram per milliliter. It also relates to ""percentage"" if you've got 18mg juice you've got 18 milligrams of nicotine per milliliter of liquid and 1.8% concentration of nicotine per total volume. What strength nicotine to you need if you were a pack a day smoker?... that can't be answered. Some people will come in here and say ""Oh, it's Xmg"" but they'll be speaking from personal experience and it's just not applicable across the board. I've personally converted or been a part of the conversion of hundreds of people at this point and the variance of how much nic you need when starting out is dramatic. I've had people start on 18 and move up to 24 immediately, start on 24 and drop to 12 immediately, it's all over the board. I tend to recommend people get a variety of juices and start with 18mg if they were heavy smokers. The bonus to 18mg is if you like the flavor but don't like the strength you can cut it with a weaker concentration of the same flavor to bring it down to where you want.

Facts about juice:

1. PG is toxic to cats, don't let them have it in liquid form. Vaping near your cat won't make it sick unless you're chain vaping and blowing it in their face in a small inclosed area... and if you're doing that they'll probably rip your face off anyway cause cats don't give two shits about owning you if you make them angry :) 

2. Nicotine is a poison. Period. it's a poison we like to use because it makes us feel funny, but it will flat out kill you in high concentrations. if you don't know what you're doing, don't buy higher than 36mg nicotine, ever. Do not drink the juice, do not put the juice in your eyeball, do not use it as a moisturizer, do not feed it to infants, don't shoot it up, basically don't do anything but vape it and vape it responsibly. If you start to feel nausea or a headache after vaping, slow down, cut your nic to a lower level or consult a physician. Don't ignore your body, it knows you better than you do. 

3. If people say you're vaping ""antifreeze"" smile and say yes then tell them to google propalyne glycol. It IS antifreeze. So is alcohol technically. It's a safe to consume antifreeze used in a lot of places where toxic AFs can't be used. You're also vaping pesticide... nicotine is used as an organic pesticide in a lot of green house operations :P


**A coil to do the vaporizing and a method of delivering liquid to that coil.**

So the coil... this is where the magic happens and where people will find constant discontent. I can't possibly cover every detail of every type of 'topper' in this discussion so I'm going to cop out and give you some generics :) People in following comments can go into greater detail on their personal favorite juice delivery system. 

I'll break these up a bit. 

The fluffies: Some top devices have fluff in em. If you reach back into early vaping or a mall kiosk you might be confronted with the ""cart"" and atomizer set up. This tends to be an atomizer which is a small tube with a ""bridge"" of porous metal and a coil in it. You'll know the 'bridge' because it tends to look like a little triangle of metal sponge sticking up from inside the atomizer. It is usually topped with a 'cart' which is a plastic tube with an airhole on one end. A lot of times they'll be foil sealed and the way they're supposed to work is you stick em on the atomizer, the bridge pops the foil and wicks liquid from some unknown fluff up inside the cart down onto the coil and you vape. It doesn't work, those are trash, moving on. The next ""fluffy"" is a cartomizer.... Cartomizers are basically a metal tube with a roll of fluff inside and inside that roll of fluff is a coil. you saturate the fluff with liquid and vape away. These work great but aren't without their restrictions and short falls (as all systems are). You can augment your cartomizer with a 'tank' which is basically a tube you stick over your other tube and fill with juice. you punch a hole in your cartomizer and liquid can continually soak the fluff from the larger tank. This makes cartos last longer and (imo) taste better. 

The wickies: Clearomizers.... there are about a billion versions of clearos. Initially they were cartomizers with clear tubes a coil at the top and a little wick that stuck down into the tube that had liquid in it. No fluff. These leaked, broke, and generally speaking sucked. You'll see this category referred to as 'CE(insert number)' I just call em all clearos. IN broad generic talk, it's a clear tube with a coil at either the top or bottom, wicks coming from that coil into the juice reservoir. 

The drippies: This is just an atomizer. They come in a few formats but it's that atomizer I mentioned above with the fluffies... but without the fluffy. There are also ""rebuildable"" drippers but I'll cover that in a sec. This is basically a coil and some 'tiny' amount of wicking material of some sort. It could be a hard ceramic bowl or a little piece of silica/stainless steel mesh. It's always as simple as possible. you drip liquid on it, hit it a few times until it gets dry then drip again. It is arguably the 'most' pure form of vaping as there is very little to effect the flavor of your juice. 

The Rebuildables..ies?: This is a semi recent boom in the vaping industry but people realized they didn't like throwing away a bunch of stuff everytime a coil got yucky so they figured out how to make things you could just rebuild the coil in. These come in a number of form factors but you'll hear ""Genesis"" and ""Dripper"" a lot. a genesis style RBA has a deck where you build your coil, a hole to stick a wick through that coil and into a tank, and a tank to hold juice. It works a lot like a clearo. A 'dripper' RBA is just a deck with a place to put your coil. You wrap that coil around some type of wicking material and drip liquid on it like the drippies mentioned above.

However we need to use some common sense about it as well. I was on my ride home via public transit from work and saw two fellow vapers who looked to be in their early 20s. How do I know they were fellow vapers? Because they were happily vaping away on the bus until the driver told them politely not to. Which is the point that I slunk down in my seat out of embarrassment for both myself and fellow vapers everywhere as these two began to make a huge fuss about how it wasn't a cigarette and therefore not explicitly against the rules. 

One of the amazing things about vaping is the delicious smells but it can still be a bit overpowering for some people. While we're still in this gray zone of regulation lets try to prove ourselves responsible enough to not need signs every 10 feet that say ""No cigarettes or vaping beyond this point.""

Remember - just because you're not smoking doesn't mean you don't need to take a break every now and then! Personally I'll just go spend 5 minutes of quiet time in the stairwell (because fuck outside in the UK) and vape a little while just generally getting away from work.

While many people associate smoking with stress relief, the simple break from work that smoking provided allows you to experience that stress relief, so don't forget that just because the smoking is gone, doesn't mean the break should go too.",,False,self,t5_2qmlu,False,,current,True,t3_188umt,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/188umt/new_vaper_advice_when_at_work_remember_to_take/,

&gt;
&gt;I am emailing to ask for an official and in-depth response regarding the recent regulatory decision and a statement explaining some of the wording regarding electronic cigarettes on your website. As a regulatory body whose entire purpose is to ensure that people are protected and have products available to them that suit their needs, we, as the electronic cigarette users apparently having our safety ensured feel that it is part of that duty to accurately explain those decisions, citing all pertinent sources where applicable.
&gt;
&gt;Firstly - your decision reflects your desire to conform to EU tobacco legislation, however the final draft of this legislation has yet to be decided upon and released, as the North Westerly EU representative MEP Chris Davies and many others have stated in responses to the public regarding the support of a redraft of these regulations as in their current state they stand to destroy the growing electronic cigarette market and place millions of lives back in the dangerous grip of carcinogenic tobacco cigarettes.
&gt;
&gt;My question is simple, how can you support regulations that do not formally exist yet? Are decisions paramount to public health to be made so lightly that they are not worth ensuring that the guidelines are compatible with ensuring smoking harm reductions without destroying the effectiveness of smoking alternatives or damaging the rapidly growing market?
&gt;
&gt;Regarding the press release on the website, there are a few disingenuous passages I wish to have clarified, including but not limited to the following:
&gt;
&gt;""Making safe and effective products available for people who smoke can help them cut down or quit.""
&gt;
&gt;“Some NCPs are already licenced and the Government's decision to work towards medicines licencing for all these products is designed to deliver quality products that will support smokers to cut down and to quit.""
&gt;
&gt;""Recent public health guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) supports the use of licenced nicotine products in helping people to cut down or stop smoking.""
&gt;
&gt;""The RCGP supports MHRA regulation of novel nicotine products such as e-cigarettes as this will ensure that they are of good quality and reliability and are effective in helping smokers who want to use them to cut down and quit.”
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure by now you see where this is going. Your regulatory decisions seem ENTIRELY based on electronic cigarettes as part of the NRT range of products, such as gum and patches, specifically designed to stop people using anything containing nicotine. This is factually, patiently and empirically false. The invention of the electronic cigarette was by a Chinese inventor who wished to continue smoking but remove the majority of the harmful elements from it. Electronic cigarettes are not a nicotine replacement therapy aimed at weaning people away from the use of nicotine. Classifying them as such greatly reduces their effectiveness. No sensible vendor of electronic cigarette products has ever claimed a medicinal benefit from these products, simply put because they are NOT medicines. Electronic cigarettes have a great chance of helping people to ditch traditional tobacco cigarettes and that is a wonderful side-effect of their use but they are not purely a quitting aid. Electronic cigarettes, as confirmed by many of the studies and clean air reports linked below, are a safer alternative to cigarettes. Alternative being the key word here. They are an alternative method of delivering nicotine to people already addicted, people who enjoy the act of smoking and yet are fully aware of the dangers cigarettes contain and were until recently unable to distance themselves from the dangers while retaining the satisfaction of the habit or the calming effect of the nicotine. It is my understanding that classing electronic cigarettes and associated personal vaporiser devices as medicinal products would mean that under current regulations a manufacturer would be required to prove, via clinical trial, the medicinal benefit of their products. As these products do not have any medicinal benefits, being an alternative to smoking tobacco, no manufacturer would be able to satisfy the requirements to be licensed. This would overnight destroy the entire electronic cigarette industry and again, push millions back to smoking tobacco.
&gt;
&gt;Please concisely explain your decision to regulate electronic cigarettes as medicinal products when the overwhelming majority of vendors have not claimed therapeutic or medicinal benefits and furthermore please explain your viewpoint which seems to be that electronic cigarettes are purely designed as a quitting aid and not as an alternative recreational nicotine containing product?
&gt;
&gt;Thus far, I had assumed that the MHRA's view of electronic cigarettes was incredibly narrow and lacked an objective view of the subject and perhaps some expanded reading material or an open debate on the subject could have broadened your horizons, but having just read [this article](http://www.thefreesociety.org/Issues/Smoking/big-pharma-and-big-government-go-to-war-on-consumers) discussing your decision and having seen the amount of people from big pharmaceutical lobbying companies that were on the board making this decision in addition to the public outcry that you completely ignored back in 2010, suddenly I don't really feel like continuing trying to appeal to you with facts, or even sound logical discourse, it all becomes pretty clear what the MHRA intends to achieve with this decision.
&gt;
&gt;I am utterly disappointed in each and every one of you. While you ""regulate"" and turn control of an entire industry over to only the companies rich enough to become ""licensed"" by yourselves, you're condemning millions to a painful death. You're literally taking money to end peoples lives early. It's disgusting, it's completely absurd and you should all be ashamed to have made this decision against the wishes of so many people who rely on these products to keep them away from tobacco.
&gt;
&gt;My personal vaporiser is not a medicine. It is not something for you to regulate. Try taking a pack of cigarettes off someone and see how much resistance you encounter, well that's exactly what you'll get from the entire vaping community when your so called regulation comes in. In essence, all you're doing here is creating a huge black market overnight. We will not give up and we will not go back to tobacco, no matter how much you regulate on behalf of your vested interests. I will not smoke because you want to crush all the successful small businesses that are taking money away from your sponsors. We will import, we will make our own juice at home, anything to not be controlled by gigantic money machines, where chasing the almighty dollar is more important than protecting the lives of the people who depend on you.
&gt;
&gt;You have no evidence to support your decision, you have no recourse for regulating a less harmful alternative into the ground. You will not kill us. I will not be killed by suits chasing profits.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe it would have an impact if you knew the person who actually submitted the draft of the EU legislation you have vowed to back [resigned after an anti-fraud inquiry linked him to bribes from tobacco companies while writing the draft.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19964248) I doubt it, but you never know.
&gt;
&gt;Though it seems your aim was never to protect people, please see below studies on the supposed effects of electronic cigarettes on the user and the environment:

They are absolutely smitten with the ability to smoke and enjoy themselves without harming themselves or their grandchildren! 

My dad, a Navy vet, isn't interested in fruity or bakery flavors, but he's really enjoyed the basic Halo tobacco flavor I sent him with his first setup. Since father's day is right around the corner, I decided to send him a [tobacco sampler from Indigo Vapors](http://www.indigovapor.com/product_p/s-tobaccopack.htm). I kept reading here on this subreddit about how great Indigo Vapors tobacco flavors are, so I thought that an all-tobacco sampler for my dad would be a perfect gift. I ordered late last Tuesday, expecting a delivery for sometime the week of father's day. I also sent Indigo a short message letting them know that this was a father's day gift, and that I would really appreciate it if they could send a couple of samples for my mom, who also loves her brand-new ""puffer""!

Not only did the package arrive by Saturday (to extreme rural Oregon, no less), and not only was my dad thrilled at his smorgasboard of tobacco flavors, but they also included a sweet handwritten ""happy father's day"" note for my dad and several delicious samples of their fruit and gourmet flavors for my mother to try!

I live an entire continent away from my awesome parents, and I don't get to spoil them very often. They lived for me and my sisters, so it is really important to me to be able to give them what I can now that I am a grownup. It means so much to me that Indigo went out of their way to make a special, exciting, beautiful, and delicious package for my mom and dad to dig into. 

Tonight my mom gave me a call, and I wish you all could have heard her going on and on about how thrilled my dad was about his new juice! And when I told my mom that the extra non-tobacco flavors were meant for her to try, she was absolutely ecstatic. Let me tell you, Indigo Vapors has a new client for life in me and now my parents - not to mention my aunt, uncle, step-nieces, and neighbors of my parents, all of whom have been drawn in by my mom and dad's enthusiasm!

I just really wanted to let all of you know what wonderful customer service Indigo provided for me and my folks. I know everyone thinks their parents are the best, but my mom and dad really are. Dad served this country in the military for many decades, and my mother is a retired high school teacher who still gets Christmas presents and family pictures from the kids she taught who adore her. It brings tears to my eyes that Indigo put as much thought and love into a special package for them as I would.

Every Friday we at Gremlin Juice, give away juice to those that need it, deserve it, or if we just feel like it. Please note, this is not a contest. You can't enter. THroughout the week we browse the Reddit forums, and during that time, we find those people who are down on their luck and need a hand, or maybe someone that has done something completely selfless and deserve a treat. Or someone that just seems like they would enjoy a gift.

So. official words out of the way, we are TRYING to get back to having only one person a week (things have been getting WAY out of hand lately!) wo this week there are only two people (so far) gerring free juice.

As always, it's up tho them if they want to say who they are. I don't like to infringe on the privacy of others. And, hopefully some of the past Free Friday folks will drop in and say hi. I really do enjoy chatting with ALL of you.

So, On with the day!  And Congrats to the two recipients of Free Juice!

When you visit a vendor's site and look at an E-Liquid, you see a page that shows what the mix contains.  On any site I have been to, these pages usually show the amount of PG, VG, &amp; Nicotine in each mix and most allow you to adjust these to your liking.  Then there is generally a one or two line description of the juice, something like ""A flavorful and robust tobacco blend with hints of tropical goodness"".  

Now, this liquid is mixed with several flavorings, but these are unknown to the customer.  Because of some other posts earlier about [diacetyl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacetyl) I started thinking about the way other products on the market are as far as listing ingredients.  If you look on the side of a bottle of soda, it lists all of the ingredients in the product.  The secret of the mix is of course not revealed, but all of the ingredients are.  

So, I realize that this market is completely unregulated and people making e-liquid can really do what they want as far as revealing all of the flavorings used in any given liquid, but I wanted to know what you all as vapers thought about it.  

Should vendors include ALL ingredients of E-Liquids they sell?  Not the percentage mixed, just the ingredients.

EDIT:  After some discussion below it has been pointed out several times that I failed to see that ""natural and artificial flavorings"" is what is listed on the side of a food product, like the example I gave of a bottle of soda.

No photoshop. 
You can hand draw or create a collage by cutting out stuff. 
No rules on what imagery you show, be creative. 

Take a picture of your creation and post a link to the picture here, date and sign it somehow (if you don't want to mark up your beautiful work, feel free to write the date/signature on a scrap of paper in the picture) 

I will judge these based on what makes me the happiest.. whether it's funny as hell or just creative and weird, whatever grabs me the most wins.

1375826578.0,72,self.electronic_cigarette,1juaka,"Rant. My local B&amp;M, very pissed right now. ( how NOT to get my business.",85,13,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1juaka/rant_my_local_bm_very_pissed_right_now_how_not_to/," So my local (only one in probably 75 miles) opened up a few months ago. I first went there during the first week they opened. Not a lot of sstock and maybe a dozen juices. A few starter kits (ego) and that was about all.

Okay, so they just opened, no big deal, they will eventually have some better things in.

Next visit, about a month ago, i went i to see what they had and bought a lanyard. It was about 12$ and a bottle of okay juice 15ml for about 8$. I asked what the nic level was, the OWNER told me it was 24 mg and asked what level i wanted. I told him 12. He went in the back and brought me a bottle labeled with the flavor, but not the nic content or pg/vg ratios. He didnt seem to know what pg/vg it was.  That was funny because the first visit a clerk told me the owner mixed the juice himself.  Whatever, paid, left, and for the next week tried the flavor off and on, but it soon became clear the nic level was higher than he had claimed. I couldnt vape much of it, I felt it was too much nic, lightheaded, nauseous, headaches, all the symptoms of too much nicotine.

So today i went on my lunch break. A new clerk was there who seemed to be enthusiastic and had done research about vaping. We talked for well over an hour and compared our sets and the merits of what we had tried.

None of this clerks vaping gear had come from this B&amp;M. Why? Because all this B&amp;M has, still, is the same ego starter sets. Everything on display, sets and juice could have fit in a single shoe box. And the starter sets they had, these; http://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10005168/1405704-ego-ce5-2-in-1-usb-rechargeable-650mah-electronic-    were priced at 45$.

So they are ripping people off badly. Customers were coming in, with provaris, evics, i even got to see an mvp. And they were all leaving without buying anything. 

No wick, no wire, no pre coiled head for popular clearos. No drip tips. No clearos unless you buy the kit.  

The clerk said this had been happening since they opened. Some very new vapers come in for their first set, but they dont come back. Some very experienced come in, and find nothing they can buy.

And the kicker. All the juices are preordered and shipped in. They only have ONE nic level. 24mg. Anything else needs to be special ordered.

I was lied to about nicotine levels. I was sold a bottle twice the level i asked for. 

I am pissed off and fed up with an owner who is willing to lie and refuse to carry any stock that customers have been asking for.

If i had the money i would open up a vape store and run it just to put this one out of business. 

What really sucks is that this town needs a good vape shop. A lot of people smoke here, and you can still smoke actual tobacco cigs in nearly every restaurant in town. Aside from gas station Blus and njoy, there isnt any vape products anywhere else. 

I and a lot of the other vapers i have spoken to in this shitty store ( right in front of the owner) would gladly pay a good markup for the convenience of not waiting on shipping. But the way this is going, even if he ever does stock something as simple as an ego twist, it will be 60$ for the battery alone. 

I am just disgusted with this place. If you want to move and open a vape shop with no competition, pm me. 

Edit. I am not naming the shop. I dont want the employee who talked to me to get fired even if the chances are really low that anyone will mention this to the owner. I will say it is in southeast missouri. And i am serious if anyone wants to open a shop here, i know the area very well and can find a prime location.

Anyone that has come to this sub even once will recognize what a ripoff this place is. And local internet forums already have the info on how bad this place is. ( i searched them after this rant, some of the word choices were pretty entertaining)

The only ones who really need to know are not internet users and even then, this business is going to go down fast. They cant possibly get enough repeat business to stay for a whole year.

3) Where they can get one, because the gas station ones suck.


The campus where I teach is completely no smoking; the sidewalks around the edges of campus have become a graveyard of cigarette butts.  Those who do smoke look ashamed.  I've let some of my students try my ecig (eGo twist) and are surprised at the hit.

I don't make a point of it; I just need to vape during a three-hour long class.  I've done it for two terms now, have had no complaints (even had permission to do so at on and off campus sites), and the overall reaction seems positive.  I'd love to convert some of my students, but again, I don't push it.  I only answer questions and correct misconceptions they have about it.

A road trip with my in laws used to mean no cigarettes for the duration, which used to mean I felt stranded, I used to feel like I was forced to go throw withdraw around the in-laws. I was embarrassed about the hold those little white tubes used to hold over me. Now I can enjoy an eight hour shift without a flavor break, and I can go on those twelve hour drives in their no smoking car, and enjoy being in their non-smoking houses...

Also, another thing I have to brag about. I went to a college town last weekend and stayed in a friends dorm. We didn't have to walk down 4 flights of stairs every 30 minutes.

Folks, I'm going to be posting a recommendation thread every two months from here on out so we have something to link to new vapers which they can get suggestions from. The [last one](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/r1z4d/reddits_ecig_recommendations_thread_2/) is six months old and e-cig development is moving so fast, a lot of the suggestions lose relevance.   

Anyone who makes a suggestion will get a gold star next to their name though you also need to have accumulated at least 500 link karma or comment karma to be awarded the star. You have to make a suggestion in every new recommendation thread to keep the star even if it means just copying and pasting your suggestion from the last recommendation thread if you think it is still a good suggestion. 

Please remember, you are probably recommending products to people who know nothing about vaping. They need to know things like what batteries they'll need, what size drip tip, how much liquid to get etc etc. Jargon and abbreviations will probably confuse them unless explained. They need a list of everything they will need to get started. Just saying something like 'get a twist' isn't going to cut it. Recommendations for products from countries outside of North America are most welcome too. Have a look at [our last recommendation thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/r1z4d/reddits_ecig_recommendations_thread_2/) to see the kind of suggestions that are useful.

* If you recommend some things, please link to the product pages directly. Multiple links to multiple sources for the same or similar products are welcome. 

* Suppliers are welcome to recommend their own products but please mention that you are a supplier (same goes if you are acting on behalf of a supplier or are affiliated with them in any way).

* Do not use affiliate links or post coupon codes unless the coupon codes are issued directly by a supplier and do not compensate a third party.

* You are welcome to critique other people's recommendations, add to them, add links to alternative sources for the products etc etc but only the OP of the parent comment will get a star.  

* If you want to make a similar recommendation to someone else's with some slight modification or with more elaboration, that's fine.

* If you've made a recommendation recently or have seen one you have liked, you're welcome to copy&amp;paste it into this thread.

* New vapers, if you have recently started vaping and think you have found a good set-up to start with, I encourage you to recommend it though if you have only had it less than a couple weeks, maybe you should wait to see how it holds up.

While he was gone, it exploded and melted his laptop a little where he had left it charging.  This was a cheap knock-off of an Ego-C like battery, probably had no protection.  I included a [pic for reference](http://imgur.com/jthJTOy)

Obviously, this is a big deal at my job and being that I am one of the few that actually knows anything about this...I am being asked questions about these devices.   

~~Anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to give my management a better idea on what happened here?~~

EDIT:  Just an update -- as of now they have not banned the charging or usage of e-cig devices.  The Facilities department seemed aware of Lithium Ion batteries and issues with overcharging, but had never seen anything that had exploded like that.  Some people were in the office next door to the office this happened in, and said it was extremely loud -- not a little pop but more like a car exhaust backfiring.  So, for now -- it would seem that e-cigs still have safe home at my job, but time will tell.  I guarantee if this happens again, they will have to do *something* about it.

UPDATE:  Further update, I spoke to the guy who's battery blew up and **he was using a charger that was not designed for his device!!**  Apparently, he had lost the charger for the battery, and decided to use a different charger that he had for a different battery.  I would say this is a big no no, and the probable reason why his battery failed.",,False,self,t5_2qmlu,1371472067.0,,current,True,t3_1gcq9p,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1gcq9p/ego_type_battery_blows_up_at_work/,

Waiting to hear back, but I wanted feedback from you guys in the meantime. Basically it is a wider version of the eGo-C Twist with 2 batteries wired in parallel. Basically the case will be double the width but the same height as the regular eGo Twists. 2 650mah batteries side by side become 1300mah without getting any longer, just wider. I magine this fitting in my pocket quite nicely! It will also have the same variable voltage options as the Twists. The ""W"" in eGo Wide will also double as a ""VV,"" just to be kind of clever. Any thoughts?

1364223770.0,72,self.electronic_cigarette,1az4zm,ecigs got me to quit smoking. Here are some of my tips. ,78,6,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1az4zm/ecigs_got_me_to_quit_smoking_here_are_some_of_my/,"I quit smoking completely, it has been a month now. Previous habit was a pack a day of analogs (I hate that term) for 13 years. For what it is worth, here are my tips for quitting smoking using ecigs. 

Fair warning time. These are tips based off of my experiences. Your mileage may vary. These devices and juices are listed as smoking alternatives, not as cessation devices. That being said, lets carry on. 

Tip #1. When transitioning over, don't beat yourself up about cheating and having the occasional cigarette. It will happen, but being cruel to yourself over a perceived weakness doesn't help. It took me a bit of my cheating before I realized mid-cigarette that the tobacco was doing NOTHING for me. When that realization hit me, I put it out, and have not had a cigarette since. It'll take a bit for that to sink into your brain. 

Tip #2 When transitioning over, CARRY CIGARETTES ON YOU. As counter-intuitive as this sounds, I firmly believe that this is one of the biggest things I did which helped me quit. When you are new to not smoking, not having your smokes with you will cause a huge amount of anxiety. You will constantly be thinking about them. However, if you have them with you, the anxiety will not be present. You will know they are there, and can have one if you need one. When you feel the urge, do your best to vape instead. 

Tip #3 If you smoke a pack a day or more, you will hate 'cigarette size' vaporizers with the fire of a thousand suns. You may think that you want something that is the same size as a cigarette, and fits in a pack like a cigarette to charge. You are most likely horribly mistaken. I tried that, and I HATE the thing. I found myself upgrading to an ego battery and clearomizers WAY quick. Save yourself the time and trouble, go for the bigger battery. Avoid the blu-style things if you smoke a pack a day. Trust me on this. 

Tip #4 Enjoy the sudden bursts of scent that you will start getting soon. My god, I forgot that grass had a scent. It is amazing. :-)

I started smoking when I was 13 in middle school. I started with one pack a week to 2 packs a day. I knew it was getting really bad when we had P.E. finals and I ran a 11 minute mile. I was really struggling to run it, and as soon as I finished it, i was hacking and coughing. After I ran it, my teacher went up to me and told that I really needed to quit. The whole day I thought about what he said and put an effort towards quitting smoking. I tried to smoke less than what I usually smoke and making the amount smaller and smaller, but when I get stressed, I go back to where I was before. Then, I found out about electronic cigarettes and how they help a bunch with quitting. I bought at least ten of those 711 disposables before I found out about vaping. With the disposables, I smoked about 4-6 cigarettes a week, so I really started seeing improvements which made me really confident about quitting. About three months ago, my friend brought me to a local vape shop.  I saw all the cool things they had there and told myself that I had to get one. I got a standard eGo C-Twist with a stardust clearomizer. I started with the flavor ""Yummy Gummy"" with 12 mg nic. I was instantly hooked. About a month ago, I bought my first 6mg juice, and just received my order of some 0mg nic juices. It feels great now that I have been cigarette free. I'm confident in saying that i will not be picking up a cigarette anytime soon, but sticking to vaping. This sub has been really helpful with finding out information about mods,juices,sites, etc. and hope more people can push themselves to quit smoking as I did. Thanks reddit! Happy Vaping!

The analyses shows that the coffee cup warmer did very little, there is a slight reduction of -OH (alchohols) as seen at wave number ~1600 with the low temp steep. Other than that, not much happend.

At 93C it was very different. At wave numbers ~2700-3000 you can see a large change in bonds in the sample. I goes from a smooth curve that indicates a wide variety of bonds with a similar response to a much sharper curve, this indicates that the sample is a more chemically homogeneous sample. IDK what is the cause. Also the -OH doesn't decline like in the low temp sample. I have no clue.

In a few weeks I will compare to the accepted practice of dark drawer steeping and see which method is most similar. 


BTW the water content of the sample didn't really change. Both steeps only took it from ~5.1% to 5.6%.

But I'm wondering if anyone has had this/heard of this happening from [Rwar Vapor](http://www.rawrvapor.com/) or [Jazz Epipes](http://jazzepipe.com/) after buying stuff online. 


TL;DR - Bought shit from [Rwar Vapor](http://www.rawrvapor.com/) &amp; [Jazz Epipes](http://jazzepipe.com/), now credit card number info was stolen.

Edit 2: So Virus/Malware scan has been finished. On my first scan with malwarebytes, one item popped up and has been removed. It was a ""Malware.Trace"" in the registry under ""HKLM\Software\Yingsoft"" &amp; I think it was a keylogger. Its been removed and done another full sweep with malwarebytes and avast. Pretty sure my system is clean now. For the others that have recently had their card numbers jacked, you probably want to run a scan cause you probably got something on your pc to.

I did that too a while ago (with the charger) and just want to spread the word. It was [discussed in the past](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/13vtle/just_a_reminder_to_be_careful_with_your_apv/) but please don't try to cheap out on the batteries or chargers. If there is one area in all your vaping arsenal where you shouldn't be making economies, it's the battery/charger combo, as quoted from the ecf:

&gt; Economies
In the final analysis, mod explosions are caused by corner-cutting and economies of one kind or another. An explosion probably needs a chain of faults, probably including some/all of the following: user error, faulty charger, battery failure, and an APV with no safety features. This chain does happen occasionally, and we now need to take positive action to prevent the situation continuing.

&gt;  If the device has several safety features, including the most important of all: a big hole somewhere - then it can't explode.
  
&gt; If you buy the best batteries you can, and actually receive the genuine article (which you can't guarantee unless you strip them down), and if they are checked regularly, then it is unlikely they will fail.

&gt;  If you buy $3 batteries then accept the fact they are less safe than $10 batteries.

&gt;  If you buy the cheapest battery charger you can, again, you are adding to the risk.

&gt;   Every decision you make, where you cut corners by trying to do it cheaper, multiplies the risk.

&gt;   When the APV manufacturer cuts corners, and you then make more economies, the risk is mounting.

Don't settle for anything less than AW IMR batteries and xtar/pila chargers, even if doing so means buying stuff separately.

After about 36 hours in, I was completely off of the analogs. After about 10 days, I found the thought of smoking an analog completely repellant. Even while drinking. Even while drinking heavily! This is from a 20 year, pack a day smoker. I can't believe how wonderful I feel! Everything that they say is true...I smell and taste better, both in how I smell and taste the world and how the world smells and tastes me. I feel much more energetic and healthier, AND my libido is leagues ahead of where it was just a few short months ago! Performance was never an issue, but desire and energy had waned profoundly. I feel like I'm ten years younger in almost all regards. Plus I have all these wonderful vape toys and flavors to spice life up with. I am just astounded with the overall improvement in (and hopefully extension of) my life that has resulted from having started to vape. I WIN! As a result, I have begun proselytizing, and have converted easily a dozen of my loved ones. I am so grateful, lucky, and thrilled with this new world that vaping has opened up for me.

1368565610.0,74,self.electronic_cigarette,1ec8c3,"Monkey University 5-14-2013: RBA, RTA, RDA, WTF?",84,10,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1ec8c3/monkey_university_5142013_rba_rta_rda_wtf/,"Howdy Monkeys, class is in session. Today I'll be discussing Rebuildable Atomizers. This is gonna be a big one, thin on the haha and thick on the bullet lists so go pee first if you plan on reading it through. 

First, let's start with some acronyms and definitions so I don't have to type as much. 

RBA: Rebuildable Atomizer, this is any atomizing device designed to have the actual coil built by the user.

RDA: Rebuildable Dripping atomizer, a RBA with no tank.

RTA: Rebuildable Tank Atomizer, a RBA WITH a tank.

SSM: stainless steel mesh, wick material.

Silica: Glass fiber rope wick material. 

awg: American wire gauge. You'll see this follow a number designation. With wire the lower the number the lower the resistance per inch but the thicker the wire actually is. 


So, what's an RBA? A RBA is basically an atomizer that's been designed to allow you to rebuild the wick and coil portion, i.e. the consumable portion of the device. Cartomizers, atomizers, clearos, etc, they all have an assembly that you end up throwing away, RBAs save you from having to chuck stuff that is otherwise still serviceable, reduces waste, and on top of that, allows for more customization of your vaping experience in the form of building your own wick/coil arrangement, resistance, material, etc. 

Common to all RBAs is the Deck and some type of 'top cap'. The deck is the part that has the connections for the coil, a positive and negative connection. On RTAs you've got a tank, usually below the deck but sometimes above the deck. On RDAs there's no tank. There are some outlying variables like 'oids' and what not but for the most part I'd say it's safe to say that 90% of the market follows those two form factors. 

So the RBA is the piece of hardware that comes in the box, now you have to actually build it. That's going to require wick and wire. hrm.. require, wick wire... that's fun to say back to back... sorry, I'm back. 

So let's start with wire cause it's the easy part to talk about. 

As mentioned in the definitions, wire comes in AWG or american wire gauge. People tend to use from 36awg up to 28awg wire sizes. Some people will use wires outside of that range but that's the norm. From my sales, 30 appears to be the most common used.

Now this isn't normal wire... this is resistance wire. It's a special alloy that does not conduct electricity well. This means when you shove a bunch of electrons into it they bounce around more than just flowing through and some of the energy they have is released in the form of heat. This is why the coil heats up but the wires in your walls don't burn your shit down when you plug in a toaster. You cannot make a coil out of non resistance wire like copper, etc. you need Kanthal or Nichrome, I prefer Kanthal for a variety of reasons I can explain another time. The size of the wire dictates the resistance. Bigger number = higher resistance per inch. Building your coil is just a matter of selecting the appropriate gauge and length, hooking one end to the + pole and the other end to the - pole. You then shape the coil into whatever shape you want, most people make... a coil. Usually around the wicking material of your choice. There is no perfect coil set up, it's going to be personal preference. I like a giant 28awg coil sometimes and other times I Like a tiny little 36awg coil, on some devices I""ll use 32awg and wrap it up to 3ohm other times I'm running sub-ohm coils. 

The resistance you shoot for will be heavily dependent on the device you'll be using to fire it. If you've got an ego, I recommend nto going below 1.8ohm. Ego's don't have the power to really push lower coils without frying the circuitry. I never recommend anyone build below .8ohm on 'any' device. If you're still not hot enough at .8ohm you need more power not less resistance. Feel free to argue with that in the comments, I need something to not read :) 

I'm now going to talk about something you shouldn't do unless you know what you're doing... multi-coil set ups. I'm only putting this info out there to be educational and thorough... don't screw with multiple coils unless you're equipped properly with both the right tools and the right information (all of which is not going to be included in this post). 

Some folks like dual coils (or more...) basically what you're doing is putting two resistors in parallel which effectively halves the total resistance on the line as far as your battery source is concerned. I.e. 2x 2ohm coils in parallel will appear as 1ohm of resistance between the + and - terminals on the battery. Keep that math in mind when building a dual or multi-coil set up. Total resistance in the circuit = sum resistance of all coils / number of coils. Beyond that, the math starts to get a little more complicated. If you're not willing to educate yourself on multi-resistor circuitry, don't build multi-coil atomizers. They really don't provide 'that' much additional benefit that can't be had through other means. 

While on the topic of resistance... look up Ohms Law, look up how to calculate Amperage, Wattage, etc. You'll need that. Theres a Monkey University specifically on Ohms law, hit the [Monkey Blog](http://blog.steammonkey.com) to find it.


Oh, there's also ribbon kanthal. if some one else wants to weigh in with info on that, please do. My experience with it is limited so I'm not going to speak to it here. 


Now... how do you get juice to your coil?

WICK!

In a RDA you'll generally just wrap the coil around a little chunk of wicking material of your choice, drip some liquid on it and go to town. Theres a million little different set ups you can do and a lot of videos on the topic so I'm not going into a lot of detail there. 

In a RTA things get a little more complicated. With an RTA you've generally got a hole through the deck down into a tank that you fill with juice. The most common material of choice for wicking here is SSM or stainless steel mesh. There's a lot of voodoo around SSM and getting it set up right, I personally hate the stuff because I can't imagine who's bright idea it was to use a conductive material as a wick for an electrical heating element O_o. But... it's one of the better options we've got right now due to it's hardiness in liquids and at high temperatures, safe material (stainless steel), and wicking capability. But that conductivity thing is an issue... that's why people torch it or burn juice on it, or wrap it with a RYO cigarette paper and burn it, or pray to some dark god to take away the magical electron carrying properties of the mesh so that vapor may be thrust unto their waiting mouth. it's complicated... I hate sayin this again, but go to youtube. There are a million different ways to do it and I've tried em all... none of them are any better than the others once you learn to do 'that' method right. As an example, in my Aga-T, I torch before rolling, torch again, soak in juice then burn the juice off before wrapping my coil. In the RSST I use what's called the 'pulse' method, in my Zenesis I just burn some juice off it a couple times after rolling it up... it's really a moving target on how to do it right. 

So, coils and wicks and whatever... all very complicated right? Wait.. theres more. 

Airflow... 

With all RBAs theres some method of getting airflow over the coil, cause if you don't... it gets really nasty tasting due to a lack of heat regulation letting the coil get super hot and scald your juice. On many of the standard form factors theres a hole in the side of the top cap. You'll want to line this hole up with the actual coil so that when you take a drag it sucks air directly over the coil. if you want some killer throat hit, move that hole away from the coil. 


Now, with all this crap you've gotta worry about... why not just use a freakin carto? 

A lot of us RBA fans do just that :p However, the RBA itself 'can' perform better than any off the shelf product and it grants you an additional level of customization in your set up. If you're rollin a mech with some high quality batteries and want to cook a low ohm coil you can, if you've got a provari or vamo or something and want to build some big ol 3ohm super coil to get more surface area on your wick so you get more vapor production... you can. Don't like polyfil in cartos or silica wicks in vivi novas/T3s/Clearos... np, stainless mesh and build your own coil in a device that welcomes that sorta thing. 

RBA's are not a 'natural progression' as some people seem to think. If you're happy vaping a carto on an ego you don't need to go out and buy a mech mod, battery charger, high drain batteries, RBA, mesh, wire, multimeter, heavy duty scissors, etc. Just vape the carto! However, if you're a tinker like me and want to fiddle with and try to squeeze the 'best' vape you possibly can, even if it's only a marginal increase, RBAs are great for that. 

There is 1 RBA that I think anyone who likes to change up juice should have and that's an RDA. I'm not a dripper but I do like to try new juices occasionally. I used to use a standard off the shelf dripping atomizer. Switching to a RDA changed how I test juices. The ability to just rip out the guts if you get some skunky juice and wipe the thing down is a HUGE benefit, having a basically 'permanent' dripping atomizer also saves cash if you go through drippers as fast as I was testing juices. It's also nice for a change up vape every now and then. 

Genesis style (RTAs) RBAs are great once you get em rolling and can provide a superior vape but if you pop a coil or get a hotspot while out and about, they can be a hassle to deal with. 

At the end of the day RBAs are great, not for everyone, but great if you can get em working right. I highly recommend getting a cheap one and playin around and I very highly recommend having a RDA in your arsenal. 

Now, if the real pros would step in and educate the masses please?

9.  Load everthing up, and I'm generally at the USPS before their first pickup of the day.  I try to get these goods out the door ASAP!
10.  Get back home, update tracking numbers for customers.
11.  Deal with any customer service issues / calls - very rare.
12.  Look at previous day's sales and run sell-through reports week-to-date.  This helps me purchase more intelligently.
13.  Break / Family Time - my Son (Logan Jagger, 7) gets home around 3, and I help him with his homework.
14.  I start working with China / HK around 9pm Sunday - Thursday nights.  Mostly email, some Skype.  
15.  Wife time
16.  World of Warcraft - Lvl 90 Frost Mage named ""Reideen"" on Sargeras in the ""Reddit"" guild, natch.

Sometime after that I sleep, and then get up the next morning and do it all again.  And yes, I know I've left out accounting, payroll, and many other things - those are the ""not so fun"" stuffs.

Anyway, just a little insight as to how things go at VapingME most days.  I've got my 10,000 Days on now, and ready to get these orders out the door!  

Have a KILLER day, Reddit! =)

Edit:  10,000 Days was a little ""down"" on this Friday morning, so I've got ""Appetite For Destruction"" on now.  Productivity SKYROCKET! =)

This guy is amazing.

When I got into e cigs he helped me with many questions I had. Well it turns out he is only an hour away from me in Canada.

All though I have never met him he has gone above and beyond what a normal person would do.

When I was waiting for my Rebuildable supplies to come in from the USA which takes forever he sent me a package with a ton of kanthal wire, cotton wicks, silica wicks and SS mesh pre oxidized and he wouldn't take any money for it.

Today I got vape mail from him and this is what he sent me

Not to mention all the other stuff I have got from him.

Just a big thank you to a fellow Canuck, fellow redditor and a all around great human being !

I hope someday I get to meet you bud.

We have started vape it around the USA box number 2.0, the final details are getting worked out now but we are at around 90 people and will be splitting it into 3 boxes. When the boxes make it back to me I will be posting all the memontos as a success for the community.


And soon we will be having some vendor support on Vape it Forward, the details are still being worked out but keep an eye out for either bi-weekly or monthly giveaways from some awesome vendors on /r/vapeitforward


Thats all I have for everyone, I just wanted to give everyone an update, and show that out of something bad the community has come together and we are coming back stronger than ever.

Free Friday is our way of giving back to the e-cig community that gives US so much all the time!  **This is not a contest - This is not a drawing - There is no way to enter**  we select the recipient from posts made throughout the week. It is wonderful when someone is nominated, that just means it's coming from the community, not just from us! The only way to enter is just be a good person.

This was simultaneously accompanied by the strong smell of RY4 and no desire to vape, but I didn't connect these things at first, just thought the nausea might have been due to having eaten too much Mexican food on an otherwise empty stomach (which I actually did do a few hours earlier).

Well I reached into my pocket to grab something, and when I pulled my hand out it was covered in juice, which had completely coated the inside of my pocket, soaked into my jeans, and got on my leg somewhat. Turns out the top had screwed itself off in my pocket and I lost 15 or so mls of juice. Luckily most of this was absorbed into fabric and not my bloodstream, but I didn't feel right for a couple hours after that, and I'm still smelling the juice. Not good.

TL;DR: Had myself a minor bit of nicotine poisoning by being a dumbass, so don't put bottles of juice in your pants pockets (or if you have to, please make sure the tops are screwed on tight).",,False,self,t5_2qmlu,False,,,True,t3_18qcdg,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/18qcdg/psa_dont_do_what_i_did_today/,

Welcome to [r/electronic_cigarette](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/). You probably have lots of questions about what to get and where and as you can imagine we get these questions alll the time especially when we are linked to from a major subreddit. 

As of today, I have set up a new button on the right hand side (the first green one) to ask those types of new-to-vaping questions. This will prompt you to add the 'new vaper question' flair to your post so other new vapers will be able to easily see the most recently asked questions in case they have similar questions which have just been answered recently. 

The third button links to the search results for the most recent new vaper questions. It lets us see all the new questions at a glance and also lets some users who might not want to see these types of posts, block them using the reddit enhancement suite.

So before you ask a question, do have a glance at the most recent questions. You are though most welcome to ask any questions you have of course. We were all beginners at one point with questions too and the increasing range of available products and the terminology being used is very confusing even for more experienced vapers. The 'new vaper question' flair is just a way to try and stymie the flood of similar questions we sometimes get when we get a lot of new traffic at once, sometimes due to a link from a large subreddit. 
*****

* If you want to learn a bit about vaping, do have a scan of our [**main FAQ**](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/help/faqs/electronic_cigarette) linked at the top in the header. It should explain most things. However it's a bit of an information over-load and to that end, some users have submitted their own simpler FAQs for those wanting to get started. There is a link in the sidebar (the one with the pushpin) to a collection of these called: [**Sticky'd Posts &amp; Guides**](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/eyc23/ecig_guides_help_and_suggestions/).   
(The last one in the list under the heading 'starter guides' is the newest)

* If you go there you will find links to many other sticky'd posts too including links to threads about favorite e-liquid, health and safety tips and other posts of a similar nature. Some of the sticky'd posts might be confusing to new vapers and serve more as bookmarks for more experienced vapers.

* Also in the sidebar you will find links to posts like [**Reddit's Recommended E-cig Suppliers**](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/wiki/supplier_list) and [**Reddit's e-cig recommendations**](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1j4cco/). That second recommendation thread was specifically created to recommend e-cig kits to new vapers because we get that question constantly. A new recommendation thread will be started every two months because new e-cig products are always being developed and so sometimes recommendations lose their relevance. 

*****

That's all I can think to say at the moment. This post will be replaced at some point in the future with a link to simpler and more segmented guide in the new wiki system where we can also answer the most common quesions. I hope to also start lists of different types of products and where to get them to make starting vaping less confusing for the beginner. There is a list to some of the bigger [**e-cig mods here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/help/faqs/electronic_cigarette#E-cigMods) if you are curious about some of the bigger e-cigs on the market though it also very old and needs to be updated.

The first thing I thought I'd do is get some of our resident artists involved. 

I'm looking for vapor propaganda posters! These should be of sufficient resolution to be made into a poster or at the very least a flyer. 

I don't care about content, whether it's digital art, infographic, ""vintage"" style from any of the big ""ages of propaganda""

Any message is ok as long as it's Pro vaping in some way. 

Compare it to smoking and go for the shock factor, show people dieing and people living, make it graphic, I don't care. If pro-lifers can show aborted fetus on their posters, we can show rotten lungs or dead people. 

Take the ""funny"" route, make it a cartoon 

Go the eye catching beauty route and make it a piece of art with a message.... 

I don't care. 

The only rules are DO something and make it Pro vaping. 

I will run this contest for 2 weeks. I'll repost a consolidated version of this thread with the current submissions every few days depending on size and where it falls on the current list of topics so people can see it. 

I will be picking 3 winners. 

The first place winner will receive a box of Overstock. I've got a huge amount of random gear that I held back incase I needed to do replacements for people from my sales. I've got various RBAs, Ego twists, AGR carto tanks, you name it, a bunch of stuff. I'll throw an entire box of goodies at the first place winner. 

The second place winner will get a Silverback Kit and a 15ml bottle of the juice of their choice from my current offerings. 

The thid place winner will get a Chimp kit and a 15ml bottle of juice of their choice from my current offerings. 

I will be judging based on the viability of the image for use on the internet or as printed media. 

The effectiveness of the message... does it ""work"".

Quality of the image, this isn't just artistic merit but is it structured well, clean and neat, or it could be artistic merit if it's an artsy piece. Just know, an awesome infographic could beat an amazing hand drawn image and vice versa. 

The Top Ten images will be turned into posters and hung in my Brick and Mortar store once I open (hopefully early next year) 


By submitting this work, you are granting me the right to use the work online and offline for the purposes of furthering vaping. It may be posted to my store site which means it may be construed as being used to 'profit' but you all know me well enough to know this is about marketing 'vaping' and not 'me'. 

Hit me with your best stuff artists/graphics folks! 

Folks following along at home, I will consider votes on submissions when I look for my winners, so if you have a favorite, upvote it. 

If you see one you just HAVE to share, share it, throw it on facebook, reddit elsewhere, twitter, whatever. I'll be sharing the top ten once the contest is over, pretty much everywhere :) Let the Vaporwars begin.

  I have put in a few safety measures just now that will not process a transaction if your billing address is incorrect.  Before it was at my discretion to accept a purchase or not.  Now it is up to the system.

Please make sure your billing address is correct.  If you moved recently make sure all your addresses are updated with the proper banks and credit companies.  Our system now kicks you back to the checkout page if the zip and street address do not match what is on file.

If you have ordered from us before and your card is being denied now, please double check that your address is correct in our system and your CC providers.  Shipping to a different address is fine.

EDIT: I got some stuff figured out.  Now the system will deny an incorrect zip code and warn me of incorrect street address but still accept the sale.  I know a lot of people use prepaid cards that don't have a street address associated with the account.

The solution contained SHS from 3 analogs diluted to 50%.  
The photos show what we already know: SHS kills myocardial cells.
What we didn't know is that the first two samples exposed to SHV produced by 510T atomizers (unfortunately no photos yet) show absolutely no dying of cells! He is using 9mg and 12mg eliquids.

If it was going to help it would have in about 6 weeks. 4 months later and I can still barely walk. But when Vapefest came to NY I knew I had to go. With walker in tow I went to spend time with my vape friends. I just passed my 3 year vaping anniversary and decided I wanted a Billetbox as my present for that. I checked their website every hour on the hour everyday. I checked forums and chats and everywhere to get one. At vapefest I met up with Tower of Vape who happened to have one and let me try it. After seeing how much I loved it he let me use it the whole weekend. I was in love with this mod even after using it. When it came time to give it back he said it was mine and PIFed it to me. I couldn't believe my ears and had to ask a few times for him to repeat himself. I was almost in tears at this point. How could someone do that, knowing how much this mod is worth? He said that he knew how much I wanted it and it was mine. I even tried giving him one of my mods in exchange but he ended up giving that to my boyfriend to wait till I got home to return it to me. This gentleman is a sweetheart with a heart bigger than anyone I've ever known. It made me happy during a time when happiness doesn't last past the next spasm of pain. And changed my outlook on life. Things like this don't happen. I'll forever be grateful to him and if karma exists, I know he'll hit the jackpot in it. I'll leave this here as I'm tearing up again.

...there was a line of people cued up for the doors to open. I met monocule_otto who gave me his half-full bottle of MBV Hawk Sauce. Thx dude!  I brought juice to trade but he was weaning down a nic level and I was holding several bottles of 24mg. So I turned to these other guys and tried to pay it forward... but then the doors opened and everyone rushed in. So much for my 1st PIF.   
  
So I stuff my joose and rush in too, and what's the first thing I see?? Stuff I've only seen on websites! [Waaaaaaaat!!!](http://i.imgur.com/vdpS5Z9.jpg)  
  
The second thing I see and hear is this awesome band called [THE ATOMIZERS!!](http://i.imgur.com/acLMtl2.jpg) Yea, I know!    

And I meet all of [these guys!](http://i.imgur.com/CeB9BmY.jpg)    
  
And [that guy!](http://i.imgur.com/0dDdoRO.jpg) 
  
And then I run into the [motherlode.](http://i.imgur.com/1wAWqZt.jpg) 

An MBV motherlode!  Rows and rows of [MBV joooooose!](http://i.imgur.com/wQWngkN.jpg)   

I think we pretty much all went bananas! And then, [we vaped.](http://i.imgur.com/gix9jiP.jpg)   

And vaped. And vaped. And tried all the MBV flavors. 

Nothing like vaping with other vapors.  Like kids in a candy store. JJ hooked it up. Thx JJ!  Free 20ml of juice, snacks, drinks, a variety of spicy chicken nuggets and everyone having a good time = fuck yea!  

And THE ATOMIZERS were really getting into [their groove!](http://i.imgur.com/mfwUbEx.jpg)  

Covering songs in theme with TVSs ejuice. Everyone waiting for the MBV guys to show up. And finally they did! And it was [HUGS](http://i.imgur.com/DkBLUne.jpg) [ALL](http://i.imgur.com/QUUMV95.jpg) [AROUND!](http://i.imgur.com/F02PtIf.jpg)   

Then Jesse and James hopped behind the counter and did what mixologists do best, mixing and big pimping [left](http://i.imgur.com/LbYaTfl.jpg) and [right!](http://i.imgur.com/LtjxA1A.jpg) 

It was mighty fun to see these guys mucking it up with everyone. Good guys, those MBV guys!

JJ and his spot on crew also introduced their Funk, Jazz, Soul and Rock n’ Roll themed ejuice.  I tried the Elvis, the Ike &amp; Turner, the Jimi Hendrix and the Purple Haze. I almost settle on a very peachy Ray Charles but then I tried the Al Green and I knew it would be my new fave ADV. 

I start talking to another The Vape Spot Bartender about RBAs and he said “you need to talk to Rick, he pretty much wrote the book on the Phoenix.” Rick is a TVS Bartender and also happens to be the same Rick from [RnMreviews!](http://www.youtube.com/user/RnMreviews/videos?flow=grid&amp;sort=dd&amp;view=0) 

So I walk over with eyes glazed over in anticipation and guess what? Rick is straight dropping knowledge helping some guy with his rebuild right there in front of me. I’ve only seen that shit on vid!!! I wish I would have snapped some photos, but I was too mesmerized.  After about 20 questions, Rick let me vape his [POLDIAC mod.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2uNoAg_vpo) 

Oooooohhwwaaahhhh that first hit. Are you kidding me? I couldn’t even see my own eyeglasses right in front of my goddam eyeballs!  It was like a warm, dense San Francisco fog.  I kept saying “Are you kidding me?” over and over again. They both were laughing at me. Or with me, but it didn’t matter ‘cuz I was pulling hits like a steam powered freight train. I think the coil was wrapped at .4ohms! And the POLDIAC felt like solid gold in my hands. It was fucking magical. 

All in all, it was a great group of people, put on by another great group of people, visited from afar by another great group of people.  Who knew that quitting analogs could be so fun?!

What more can I say? Oh I know…

Steam Monkey is going a lil dark for the next couple of weeks. I'm not closing down or anything but I got nailed in the last couple of weeks and I'm pretty much out of stock on all the 'big ticket' items like Aga-T+, agr, ccts, etc. I'm almost out of twists which will relegate me to basically selling cartos, mesh, wire and drip tips... not a lot of folks place orders 'just' for those types of little things. 

I was sad at first but I'm also closing on a new house with a proper workshop, space for juice manufacture and just in general a nicer living arrangement than my current house. The closing wasn't supposed to happen until the end of Feb but it became available this friday so we're jumping on it. As such I'm going to be crazy busy with getting the new house set up, old house fixed up and listed, and all the normal crap that goes along with my so called life ;) 

I'll still be processing orders, I'll still be, as the cool kids say ""all up ins"" this reddit and participating but I won't have any new product or restocks coming down the pipe until probably the end of the month, chinese new years is obviously playing the major role in that. The timing works out though cause I dunno if I'd have been able to juggle the order volume + restock inventory + process all my materials on top of everything going on right now so I'll count my blessings even if it means a lil loss of income during the process. 

I sorta hate losing momentum but... I'm working on some pretty fancy stuff with some pretty fancy people that I hope to get moving in the next couple of months. Stuff I think you ladies and gentlemen (and Slumberland) will really like. This also gives me some free cycles to spend on that. 

I'm posting this because I don't want you fine folks to think I was a flash in the pan sorta shop, it's gonna be a slow month but as soon as I'm able to replace orders I will not only be back to my normal antics but I'll be back with a vengeance. I've got big plans for the Monkey and I hope you all come along for the ride :) 

Thanks for being a great community, awesome customers, and just generally cool cats. 

IN the hiatus... I'm open to suggestions for potentially new items to stock when I get back in action... I'm currently eyeballing that ""Groove"" thing madvapes just got in, I miss having a nice VW option on my store so if reviews come back favorably on that lil guy I might pick those up. Anything else you'd just love for the monkey to have? (don't say Juice, I'm working on juice but I wanna see what the FDA has to say before I invest into the equipment, etc, for bulk juice manufacture).

Thanks again, I'm not gone, I'm just fading into the background for a couple weeks.

I made this account in order to maintain my anonymity so to speak.  I have had an incredibly fun time over the last few months posting in this subreddit.  I'm a genuine fan of the people here, and I feel a strong sense of community like no other place on the interweb. 

Someone has now decided to take it upon themselves to create a ""GRIMMGREEN"" account on reddit.  

It started here from what I can tell
http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/zamwb/can_i_get_shipping_for_the_v2_to_canada_for/

I want to assure everyone here that this person posting as GrimmGreen is NOT ME.  As far as I can tell this person has done nothing wrong, or offensive or slanderous to me,  except for impersonating me. 

After dealing with multiple fake ""GrimmGreen"" youtube and twitter accounts I figured I should nip this in the bud before it get's out of hand.  

Like I said,  I made this RealGrimmGreen account in order to clear this up right away.  I'm not going to be posting from this account in the future, but I guess now that I have made RealGrimmGreen i'm obligated to do an AMA at some point? ha ha ha

Here is some verification

keep on vaping friends,  Maybe i'll get to meet some of you at Vapercon2 , the pleasure would be all mine.

Variable voltage (VV) and variable wattage (VW)? That sounds confusing! Don't worry, we were all once just as confused as you are.

Quick explanation would be voltage is what controls the level of heat coming to your coil compared to your resistance to create wattage, which is power.

A simpler explanation would be think of VV as a manual car and VW as an auto car. With VV you need to check the resistance and apply enough voltage depending on the atomizer to create power. Variable wattage basically just adjusts that for you depending on the given circumstances (much like an automatic car adjusting your gears for you depending on the circumstances).

Much like cars, people prefer different functionality in a mod. I prefer variable wattage because again like cars, it takes away a lot of the learning curve away. However, variable voltage will teach you the fundamental science behind the voltage and wattage (like gears in cars!).

I had quit a couple of times during those 20 years but the longest was only 6 months before I was back smoking again. I turned 40 a few years ago and since then have had the unspoken New Year's Resolution to quit but never really had a plan in place other than steel myself for a cold-turkey quit or hope for a cold or the flu to make smoking distasteful to me long enough to shake the habit. This year was no different, though I tried the gum for a few weeks and got down to about half a pack or less until something triggered the habit and back up to the ~1 PAD I went again. More and more my motivation to quit has been the outrageous price of the damn things and where I live I think I'm on the lower end of it ($5.50/per pack) and it's **still** galls me to pay that.

About 2 months ago a smoking friend showed me his eGo vape and I thought it novel but kind of silly - until he'd mentioned that since he'd switched to it the only time he'd have, or crave, an analog cig was when we were hanging out together because he could bum one from me. A few weeks later I made some new friends who are former smokers and fervent vapers and a week after meeting them I found myself shopping online and pulling the trigger on a kit with eGo Twist batteries and T3/Evod tanks. 

I've been vaping that gear for a month now and transitioned to 0mg juices and been nicotine free for the past 4 days. I picked up a bunch of tanks so I can give each juice it's own tank but other than that I've shied away from geeking out on the mods and options. But it's been the most natural, even-tempered, non-disruptive quit process I've experienced without the ""benefit"" of a 100+ degree fever. Along the way I've recruited new vapers of my own, a half dozen or more friends and workmates who have asked about my gear and juices, and had the disquieting/confusing/awesome experience of a non-smoker asking me to blow vapor in their face because it smelled so good. 

I'm pretty active physically and even when I was smoking I never felt like it was *directly* affecting my sports performance. That is, I never hit a wall where I couldn't breathe or was hacking, and I'm talking about being out and sweating doing cardio for hours at a time. But I'm anxious to see how my overall performance improves from here on out and have already seen a slight uptick in my pace and when/how I hit that 'bonk' point. Mostly I seem to sleep a lot better since switching to vaping...I don't wake up tired, I feel like I'm getting *rest*. 

But the **biggest** difference has been about the smell, though not in the obvious way you'd think. When I smell it on current smokers, or get a whiff of it in an elevator or a hallway or a parking lot, it's become foreign and off-putting instead of familiar. I don't notice the smell **more**, I notice it **differently**. Before, it would identify someone to me as a comrade...someone who wouldn't judge me or treat me with contempt before even getting to know me, and I would offer the same consideration in return. And the more that cigarette smoking has not only become socially unacceptable but **aggressively** unacceptable, the more I see how much a wall that smell builds around people who smoke. How much a wall it built around me. I'm a reasonably attractive person, have a good career, good friends, and aside from smoking, am healthy and consider myself pretty laidback and well-rounded. But in the past month of vaping I've become painfully aware of how the smell of smoke on me had marked me. And it makes me sad for those years of feeling, or being made to feel, like I wasn't or couldn't be a good person because I smoked. And yes, you can say well fuck em, but when your options are to smoke or tell the rest of the world to fuck off it can get quite lonely because it's become perfectly acceptable to treat a smoker as sub-human. 

Smoking SUCKS, no smoker will ever tell you otherwise, and yet there's something really relaxing about it and I'm **so** grateful for vaping, but what **really** sucks is the shame and self-loathing and social exclusion that has taken place in the collective conscious regarding smoking. I can understand why, on the surface, a non-smoker would not want to date or be around a smoker given a preference, but what really caught me sideways has been how *cruel* the non-smoking world is now that I'm closer to that side of it. It's almost like as a vaper you've snuck into the cool kids clique at high school and you're hearing all the terrible things they say and think about everyone they believe is ""lesser"" because as a group they can validate each other on how horrifying smoking is and how horrifying the people are who smoke, and it's not like as a smoker you didn't hear those things but being on the non-smoking side of it now it all sounds so much uglier and inhumane...

I don't **ever** want to be the ex-smoker that's succumbed to the douchebag koolaid. 

**TL;DR Quitting cigarettes and vaping for a month has made me realize that never-smokers can be self-righteous douchebags and the biggest difference I've noticed in quitting smoking hasn't been in how I feel, but how others treat me.**

Yes, I am an EMT and was an EMT instructor / CPR instructor at one point (still am, just dont teach this stuff that much anymore). 

On my tour (that is what we call a shift) I had 10 guys who smoked at least 1-2 PAD including myself. We all went along our merry ways, smoking and dying faster. 

Back in February my buddy /u/rwkasten got me looking at this subreddit and I finally decided I wanted to take my 2 PAD habit with vaping. My fiance was on board and actually got me an eGo twist kit for valentines day. 

Fast forward to now... 

I went in for my normal shift Monday, and everyone has some sort of eCig kit. I think we have one smoker left. We all still smoke 1-2 cigs on tour, but nowhere near the pack we use to eat up. Usually we smoke after something shitty (like having a violent patient try to beat the shit out of us, or someone dies.. stuff like that) but honestly enough, we are much healthier due to vaping. 

The oldest one out of them all (he is 50 something) first questioned it, and he is even enjoying it now. He wanted me to tell all of you (and I quote) ""thanks a lot, fuckers - I can breath again""

**TL;DR**

We all thank you for starting me on vaping, and getting the rest of my EMT's vaping. We dont smell like rotten, dirty death anymore when dealing with patients.

*NOTE* I am quite sick today, so if this makes some sense then I am lucky. **Because of vaping** I don't have a sinus infection, but just a really nasty cold.

I thought I was ready, then I realized that the PO closes early on Saturday so I woke up and freaked out. I had way more orders to fill than usual because of the aga-t/igo/agr restock and suddenly I thought it'd be the first time I'd miss my 24hour shipping goal. 

My wife noticed I was stressing and asked if she could help so I sat her in the stock room, I'd pack the orders and hand em to her and she'd stick the labels. After a few boxes she asked me what I was writing on every packing slip. I told her I give a lil thanks and sign it, she said I was spending a lot of time on that and asked if she could just sign my name instead, they'd never know the difference... I decided that was weird so I told her just to sign it herself :p

Long story short, my wife helped a lot, she signed a lot of the packing slips as she was closing up and labeling the boxes so some of you might have gotten a ""Thanks -Fleur"" instead of a ""Thanks -Lance"" this time ;) 

I love my wife! If it wasn't for her a number of your packages might not have made it out today. 

I've identified some more points I can be more efficient in my packing so that shouldn't happen again but if you ever get an order signed by Fleur instead of Lance, thats my pretty wife and she is physically incapable of farting apparently and will not allow me to pass gas in front of her without paying for it with no nookie time so any packages signed by her are guaranteed fart free :P

The exact items in the kit are going to be a surprise to prevent people from joining in that don't need help. Just know its a simple kit to get you started vaping and hopefully off smoking cigarettes. I have a bit of extra juice to give away so the winner will have somewhat of a choice of flavor and strength.

Same rules as last time. Post here your story of why this can help you or a family member/friend. Upvotes will determine the winner. Those who don't win can try again next giveaway if they still need help. 

All I ask is please be honest and if the opportunity presents itself in the future, please pay it forward to someone else who may be in a position that needs a little extra nudge to get them to cross over to vaping. If you are in a position to help yourself or help a friend please don't enter. 

There will be many more of these pretty frequently as long as people keep offering their goods for the cause. A website is being worked on by a fellow redditor to hopefully streamline this so we have a place that I can see who is donating what and who is receiving the kits. Right now I'm keeping track through PMs and its getting hard to organize. Next giveaway will be someone else offering up goods and either they will post or I will post on behalf of them. If we get to a point where a complete kit can't be made then I or another redditor help fill the gaps.

Ill be closing the giveaway on Wednesday evening. Once the person is chosen ill ship the kit the next day (if I don't end up with strep and the flu this time).

Good luck to all!!


Edit: wow, this round is bigger than the last. Looks like lots could use a nudge in the right direction. Good luck everyone and remember I hope to host one of these pretty frequently because I have received a lot of PMs from redditors willing to donate their gear and juice.

Edit: keep forgetting to mention US only.

This ends Wednesday so lets get all the votes in!

Looks like Jordan will be the recipient of the goods.

The kit includes a gunmetal bolt, a kanger with some replacement coils, a charger and a 18500 battery. I've got a bottle of solar flare from mbv and a bottle of one of my basic tobaccos.

Never again (new device in comments),73,9,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1jrx31/no_more_chantix_never_again_new_device_in_comments/,"So, I quit Chantix last week. Wednesday, on Day 8, after having broke out in fever and rashes that started around Day 6. My girlfriend finally made me go to the doctor after the fever didn't break and the rash was still quite... Bad. And spreading. I went to the doctor, and they admitted me for overnight in the ER to keep a watch on me, keep checking my blood for white blood cell count and vitals. Keep me hydrated and basically make sure it didn't get worse. Apperantly, it turned out that I developed a small case of Steven Johnsons Syndrome, brought on by an adverse reaction to... You guess it. Chantix. 

So today I went to Vape Dojo, in Ellicott City, MD. I had been looking to this for about a week anyway, and was planning on making the switch sooner, but. Hospitals and being sick overall prevented that. The staff were very nice, and knowledgeable. I had tried the crappy e cigs before, that you get at the mall. Yeah, i wasted the hundred dollars, and even washed my cig in my clothes. I even have one, of similar variety, that one of my coworkers gave me after she quit. It was a low tobacco though, and I just... Didn't like it. For the standard reasons. I knew I wanted something I would want to last a while, wouldn't want to buy another one later, but could customize and upgrade if and when I wanted to though. So, here's what I ended up with. http://imgur.com/zxF5HIn

Luckily, i didn't get any of the worse ""side effects"", that I've read about. And only read about after looking into side effects. I'm a little disturbed that the person doing the smoking cessation, that recommended and wrote the prescription for Chantix, never warned me about anything else that could have happened adversely. I'm glad I'm off it now, as a couple of days after I went off it, i started to get into a dark place. Luckily, i kept a grip and told myself that it's just the medicine. 

Sorry for rambling. If you read all that, I guess thank you. If you know what Steven Johnson Syndrome is, then you know how serious it could have been, had I just kept waiting for it to clear away on its own. I'm telling everyone I know to find other avenues, as they were waiting in my word before they tried it. Feel free to spread another story of what can go wrong. 

Happy vaping. I'm happy to be here with you guys. I think we're going to get along fine.

EDIT: I'd like to thank u/HairyHamburgers for telling me about Vape Dojo also. And for giving me a little more knowledge before going in without knowing what's what.

[4:18:23 PM] Joe (Vaporjoes.com): I like Kentuckyjosh.com better :D

When you go to the Kentuckyjosh.com site, it routes to Vapor Joe's page, which already has multiple urls routing to it. I'm sorry but don't we have enough problems of our own to face in our community without Vapor Joe bullying other deal bloggers. Vapor Joe already states that he gets tons of hits a day so why prey on someone else? This is pathetic. Thoughts?

I had a few people contact me for my address to send me some old gear, and Steve from SnG Vapor offered to send me a kit. I threw him my address and never heard back from him, so I assumed he was busy or forgot all about it, I wasn't mad or anything, it was a nice offer.

I was asking about disposables a few days ago to get me by, when 1stGenRex contacted me asking my email to send a coupon code for DiscountVapers, while it was a very generous offer, I didn't really want to accept, that is until I inhaled one of my old Blu cartos, which was insanely awful. He sent me a coupon code, more than anyone could ever reasonably ask for, so I ordered up a kit.

Fast forward to today. I had been in Ohio the past two days to work on some servers we have out there, I stopped by home because I was expecting my DV order in the mail and I needed to grab a shower then head to the hospital. I opened the mailbox, and to my delight my DV order was there, time to start vaping! I pull out the envelope, and noticed that my mail carrier had carelessly stuffed the rest of my mail in the box. I pulled it out, and noticed another box inside.

I immediately thought, ""Oh God, my card info got jacked and now I'm going to have a crap-load of debt racked up."" I look on the box, and wouldn't you know it? SnG Vapor. Steve had sent it after all. I was floored by how generous a few people could be to a complete stranger.

SnG threw in a passthrough, 2 bottles of juice (the Pixie Dust is AMAZING), along with some candy and cards.

DV threw in a free bottle of ""Haze"", which tastes nearly identical to Pixie Dust. Awesome.

Here's the hull: http://i.imgur.com/LQ7T6IS.jpg

And here's my car after I was vaping all the way to the hospital, looked like a hotbox: http://i.imgur.com/AfiwVcO.jpg

I can't seriously thank you guys enough. Once I get my finances in order, I plan to pass this good-will on and hopefully encourage more people to take up vaping and help fellow vapers out.

So, today is a little different, as the main recipient is someone from my local business. Bonnie.  I was contacted by her best friend that she is having a really REALLY hard time quitting analogs, and with a couple surgeries already, this is becoming a life or death situation. 

Bonnie recieved a lot of flavors to try, and hopefully this will help get her to finally stop the analogs and work on getting healthy. (I will print out and pass on any messages if there are any)

Not only was their shipping free, they mailed it within the same hour and i got it in 2 days. I know this because i called them to adjust the address since i forgot the building number and they couldn't fix it because it was already out the door (45mins later)

Also the fact that they actually have a number to call and answer right away was awesome. Most other vendors only have email submission forms and take anywhere from 1-3 days to reply (some never answer)
