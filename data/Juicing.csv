I started out at 400 pounds, which is about these pics right here:

This was at Blizzcon 2011.  Yeah I play WoW.

When I started the actual juicing diet I got myself down to about 370/380.  I am not good at documenting but here is a pic of june 15 2012, basically when my life changed:

http://i.imgur.com/OctLcgT.jpg


Now juicing wasn't easy.  I was really really hungry after the first 5 days.  I decided to incorporate 1 cheat day per week.  But even then my stomach was so use to the juice i would puke my cheat day food so I had to take it easy even then.  Sometimes I would take an entire week and basically eat subway and think ITS OK THIS FOOTLONG IS LOW CALORIE, but then again i caught myself in the fat Roberto lie.  I juiced for about 45 days and lost a crazy 60 pounds!

Best part about it was I felt GREAT and still feel amazing.  After those 45 days I started to just eat good foods.  Nuts, almonds, fish, chicken, brown rice, everything whole wheat.  And before you know it I was down to about 290 pounds after 3-4months!

Well today I am at 267 and here are some nice after pics.

Now for juicing! My favorite combo has always been

2 kale leaves
2 celery sticks
2 apples
10 green grapes
1 swiss shard leaf
half inch of ginger
4 broccoli heads
2 bokchoy leaves

This gives me most energy and leaves me nice and full ALL THE TIME.  I could drink this every damn day.

And I also take Mega Man Vitamins! Big thanks to this juicing community who continues to provide awesome information for guys like me who are basically dumb when it comes to nutrition

1334005199.0,36,self.Juicing,s1e4h,Year of Juice - Day 100 Update,41,5,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/s1e4h/year_of_juice_day_100_update/,"I have mentioned it previously here and there in this subreddit, but I am maintaining a juicearian diet for the duration of 2012. Today is not only the 100th day of 2012, but also the 100th consecutive day that I have obtained all of my calories from freshly extracted juices. I will continue as such until December 31, 2012.

Over the past five years, I have been gradually increasing the duration of time that I spend on juice...

* 2006 - 1 day
* 2007 - 7 days, 40 days
* 2009 - 100 days
* 2011 - 200 days
* 2012 - 1 year

Initially, I had no long term aspirations, but was simply curious about the effects of long term juicing. Each time, the benefits were so favorable that I decided to extend the duration of each subsequent trial. Currently, I pretty much view myself a juicarian. When not juicing, I am a 100% raw vegan. I haven't made any firm commitments regarding juicing after 2012 concludes. If things go as great as they are going now, I may continue.

The positive benefits of long term juicing have been greater than I could have ever hoped...

* I am turning 40 this year but physically I feel like I did when I was 10.
* My immune system is rock solid. I am completely free of illness/disease.
* I am in the best shape of my life. I no longer drive a car and cover 7000-8000 miles by bicyle annually (for much of the year through rain, sleet and snow).
* I effortlessly maintain a very svelte and fit body.
* I consume as much juice as I desire and I never feel hungry or deprived.
* Blood pressure, total cholesterol, blood sugar, resting heart rate and body fat are all at lifetime lows.
* The practice and self-discipline of juicing has massively strengthened my will power, and this has spread out into all aspects of my life. 
* My mental clarity and creative abilities are astonishing.
* At this point into the year, I am in a constant state of emotional bliss and well-being.

I make sporadic updates on my Facebook page [which can be found here.](http://www.yearofjuice.com)

I also maintain a [Google Docs spreadsheet of my stats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArN6FrogqLQvdExaUG9Tc0hmaVgwZDV5X1FwajBVT0E). I am sometimes a day to two behind on this before I transfer my handwritten notes to the online spreadsheet.

Part of the reason that I am doing this is to reset the psychological bar for those who want to juice fast, but feel daunted by the idea of going without solid food for 7 or 30 days. I have inspired many people to try juicing/juicefasting, and if there's anything I can do to help inspire you, then I'd be more than happy to help.",,False,self,t5_2s602,True,,,True,t3_s1e4h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/s1e4h/year_of_juice_day_100_update/,

I decided to do a juice fast because when I watched ""Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead"" I realized that I was basically Phil Staples, the fat, unhappy guy that basically sits around for hours on end for work and not making any progress save that toward death.

So I decided that I was going to change much the same way he did. I was determined to do all the things that I've been saying I want to do for so long, and I figure if I can do this, it's a great first step of many.

I bought a Breville Juice Fountain, a couple of BPA free 24 oz containers and got to it. I subsisted mainly on the ""Mean Green"" for the entirety of the 60 days, there were a few times that I did a whole cantaloupe for breakfast or tried different fruits but I'd say 90% of the time it was the standard ""Mean Green.""

One issue I had when I started was the scale only went to 440 pounds and I erred it out, let me tell you, it's disconcerting seeing the ""Err ---"" when you step on a scale. Given that and after the first couple of days the scale read ""440"" I decided to use 441 as the starting weight and counted from there.

How'd I do? This morning I weighed in at 355, so 86 pounds down from my starting weight. I started this wearing a size 50 pants that had stretchy portions of the waist band, and was definitely using the stretch to my advantage; but now I can comfortably button a size 46 pant without any effort.

I haven't noticed any acid reflux since the second night or so. I'm sleeping better than ever and don't have crashes anymore.

Here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/01byz) showing what my face looked like on day 0 and today, I've decided to let my hair grow until I reach my goal weight, I figure it also hides the fact that I'm losing weight from other people. I'm not hiding it for any particular reason, I just want to do it for myself really and when I get where I want to be, then I'll share it with everyone. I also have body shots but I have a few identifying tattoos and would prefer to not have my identity publicized until I get where I want to be. (Not that I'm known yet, but someday hopefully.)

Here's a [shot](http://imgur.com/2HUlU) of my weight chart and my intermediary goals, I'm 6'2"" to give you a reference point.

What now? I'm glad that I have juicing in my bag of tricks now and know that, if and when needed, I can use it to clean my body and refocus myself, reevaluate my relationship with food. I think I'm going to go towards a ketogenic diet for the foreseeable future, I had great success with it before, but never examined my relationship with food when I was younger so after I had reached my lowest adult weight, I reverted to terrible decisions and ended up at my highest adult weight.

But I am really disappointed at the level of ""toxin"" talk going on, though I appreciate the existence of this community at all. It's scientifically unfounded. No number of naturalnews.com links can convince me otherwise.

So why did I start juicing and doing juice fasts? What are the actual observable benefits? Easy:

1. I am fat. I want to lose weight. Other attempts have failed.
2. I have a poor diet, low in fruit and vegetables.
3. I suffer from various conditions which may aggravated by weight and diet.
4. Vegetables *definitely do* help prevent serious diseases, like heart disease (a lot) and cancer (a little).
5. Juicing is the fastest and easiest way to eat a ton of fresh fruits and veggies.
6. Calorie restriction (fasting) is proven to be effective at helping you live longer, avoid atherosclerosis, keep weight down, improve memory, etc.
7. Modern medicine has extended our life span FAR more than poor diet can shorten it, but I believe that a good diet can only help.

1354568503.0,28,self.Juicing,147xn5,Juicing as meal replacement.  It doesn't have to be all or nothing.,30,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/147xn5/juicing_as_meal_replacement_it_doesnt_have_to_be/,"I have been juicing as a breakfast and lunch meal replacement 5 days a week since Father's day and I feel like it has been a success.  Before juicing I would skip breakfast and usually eat some type of fast food combo meal for lunch and then have a normal meat and potatoes home cooked dinner.  

Since about August I have been preparing 32oz. of juice and drinking it Monday through Friday and eating a normal dinner in the evenings and normally on the weekends.  In addition to juicing as a meal replacement I have cut out all snacking and I no longer drink soft drinks, packaged fruit juices, or sweet tea except on rare occasions.  While the weight loss is slow it is certainly there and I am currently 12lbs from my goal of 205lbs.

My typical recipe includes the following:

* 3-4 kale leaves
* 4-5 stalks of celery
* two whole carrots
* two small granny smith apples
* a handful of flat leaf parsley
* a chunk of ginger
* one beet
* one peeled lemon
* one whole cucumber

It isn't the tastiest blend but I'm not doing this for pleasure.  I will say that the lemon is key, if I leave out the lemon it tastes like sewage and I can barley choke it down.  I prepare all of this every morning in an Omega Vert 350 which works well as long as you chop the stringy vegetables.  

I typically drink a cup of coffee in the morning with sugar and half &amp; half then have 16ozs of juice around 11:30am.  (I've never been much on breakfast)  Around 3:30-4:00pm I will finish off the rest of the juice then I have a normal meal with my family at around 7:30-8:00pm.  This works well for me becuase I don't get hungry during the day and I still have a *real* meal to look forward to each day.  The first few weeks were difficult as I would be ravaged around 6:30pm but that has subsided.  I also now find it much easier to control my portions when eating solid food.  I used to be a two full plates at dinner type of guy but now I eat a more normal sized portion and feel satisfied.

[This is a graph of my weight since Aug. 17th.](http://i.imgur.com/jHTA6.jpg)  After returning from a vacation in late July I was at a peak 247lbs.  The two distinct peaks in the graph coincide with the week after my daughter's 1st birthday in late August and the week after Halloween.  Eating sweets and candy don't help this effort and it shows on the graph where I cheated.

I just wanted to toss this out there and let others know that you don't have to fast to lose weight and feel better with juicing.  You can do a partial diet change and see results while still eating foods you enjoy and spending meal time with your family.

My wife really misses cooking and eating together as do I, we have great fun together preparing meals and eating delicious things! I think I'll probably transition to eating dinner again in about 3 weeks, and have been thinking about making a 30 day fast a yearly habit in addition to daily juicing. So enough of that! Here are some stats for those interested:

Day 1:
Male 5'8"" 200.00 lbs - Blood pressure ≈ 138/86

Day 30:
(Still Male 5'8"") 178.6 lbs - Blood pressure ≈ 110/72

Drank an average of 48oz of juice 3x's daily, probably at a ratio of 75% veg(maybe more) to 25% fruit. Also drank ≈ 3 1/2 liters of water and one 16oz can of coconut water daily. No real exercise routine as of yet...have a large work project that requires a fair amount of physical exercise and recently bought a house which has been keeping us quite busy with yard work, reno's etc.

Oh, and just ordered a VRT350! Would've been nice to have it these last 30 days but better late than never! Feel free to AMA!

46 days ago a couple of weeks after watching ""Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead"" a couple of times and buying a juicer I decided to start juicing. The amount of weight I've discarded is pretty cool, 73 pounds so far, I now weigh less than I did 7 years ago, but that isn't the best part. 

A few years ago I was diagnosed with pitting edema related to fatty liver, not heart failure (thankfully). Yesterday, while on the toilet I noticed that the color of my lower legs was lighter than they normally are and I depressed the skin over my shins to see how bad the edema was out of habit, and to my surprise, it didn't pit, I could rub my hand over the area I depressed and didn't notice any depression. I almost cried.

I haven't noticed a lot of physical differences visibly yet, but I've had to drop a pant size. I've still got a long way to go, but I think doing a juice fast (feast?) has helped me change my relationship with food and I can't wait to keep that relationship going for the better.

I hope you have a great day.

I originally saw Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead on January 1st. I ordered a Breville juicer off of Amazon and gave green juice a shot. It wasn't so bad, but I enjoy food too much to go cold turkey. I switched to a vegetarian diet, eating only fruit, veggies, whole grains and cheese. I fell off the wagon several times, but I kept getting back on. On April 10th, I started my 60 day juice fast. There have been some really agonizing days, but over the last week or so, I've not been very hungry at all. I've developed a much better handle on when I'm actually hungry versus eating out of routine, stress eating, or simply as a time to eat. I'm also very conscious of using food as a reward. I've been getting tons of comments about how I've lost a lot of weight. Initially, my intent wasn't focused on pounds, but rather on becoming healthier and controlling my psoriasis. At my fattest, I was approximately 440lbs. I dropped about 40 lbs from Jan to April and was approximately around 400 lbs. On day 60, my scale has me weighing in at 323.6 lbs. I'm incredibly pleased with myself. 

Originally at the end of my juice fast I had planned to transition over to paleo or keto, but inspired by israel_torres, I'm going to take a break (maybe two or three weeks) and commit to another 60 day fast. I'm thinking of buying an Omega VRT330 juicer for my 2nd fast. The Breville juicer I bought is good, but it leaves quite a bit of juice in kale pulp. I'm tempted to even take progress pictures this go around.

That being said, I'm a bit worried about the next two weeks. Should I just consider them as cheat weeks? Should I operate on a paleo/keto/low carb basis? I'm really nervous about it, as I don't want my hard work to go to waste but I have been dreaming of having certain foods (burrito, steak, pot roast, chicken) since day 1 of the juice fast.

Can anyone chime in or offer any advice? Should I avoid carbs while on my break? Just eat what I want but practice portion control and drink lots of water? Any advice on transitioning back to solid foods?

Thanks in advance, and keep fighting the good fight.",,False,self,t5_2s602,False,,,True,t3_urdlh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/urdlh/day_60_of_60/,

Starting weight 225.4lbs. Minimal exercise. Juicer of choice is the Breville Juice Fountain Elite. Very little prep time with this thing and cleanup is 5-10 minutes max, and waste/pulp goes out to my compost everyday. The plants in my garden are very happy! 

I started back in Monday April 8, 2013 in an attempt to juice for 60 days straight! I made it 5 whole days with 3 juices a day and dropped to 217.6lbs. Then came soccer tournament for my daughter, and I fell off the juice wagon and had restaurant foods :( At this point I realized I am not disciplined enough to stay with it 100%. So from that point I still got up early every morning and made 32oz of juice. Mainly varying mixes of Kale ($1 each), Spinach($1 each), Cilantro(2 for $1),Parsley(2 for $1),sweet potato($.89/lbs), Carrot(sparingly), Green Apple, Fuji Apple(when on sale for $.79/lbs), Celery($1 each) and Cucumber(3 for $1). Occasional items would be to add variety or flavor: watermelon(when I could get a big one for $4), tomato, kiwi, navel oranges, tangerines, grapefruit, and grapes. The leafy greens don't put out much volume so it would always be mixed with what I call a ""volumizer"". These are the water dense items (watermelon, cucumber, apple, celery, sweet potato, carrot) I would change things up just based on my taste and what my body wanted while trying to keep in mind how much sugary items I was putting in my body. I would have 16 oz for breakfast 7:30am and another 16oz around noon. Dinner would be whatever my wife was making or wherever we went out.   I love juicing and I can honestly say that it made it easy to cut calories and help me  cut down on a lot of unhealthy items from my diet. I can't lie though I ate the pizza, burgers, fast food, and the occasional soda. Towards the end I was keeping quaker rice cakes around to snack on but found myself eating half the package because my body was crying out for more sodium and calories.  Juicing acted as a meal replacement for me and I think it really made a difference. I feel so good I am now running 2 miles every night and have my mile pace down to 9 minutes per mile. It is a quick and convenient 18 minutes each day, and now I'm developing a desire to do 5k charity runs. I'm at 210.4lbs as of this morning. 

 I'm doing another 60 days with the juicing, and I'll try to report back here. Hopefully this motivates or helps someone in some way. Mainly, don't feel bad if you break a pure juice fast to enjoy good yummy food!  Regardless, I'm going to see if I can be disciplined enough to accomplish a 10 day pure juice fast starting Monday June 10. Wish me luck!

I downed a banana before I went out onto the field. Still wasn't enough, but at that point I felt proud to come as far as I did. I had gotten all I could have out of my 10 day fast at that point.

Had the same attitude the last two days as I had after Day 7. I was ready for it to be over and to start the next chapter. Time to get serious about my diet. After soccer I went home and had a beer and contemplated what I would eat. My roommates were chowing down on some fast food Mexican and I really had no desire to partake. I was eying the big bowl of fruit on the table. It's amazing how my taste preference has changed. The beers left a bad taste in my mouth. I know that every once and a while I can indulge, but the bulk of my diet has to consist of vegetables. Tomorrow morning I will finish off the rest of the kale and celery and apples and I'll probably go to the grocery store and buy more. I want to continue juicing. I still don't know what I want to eat for solid food but it will probably be some sort of salad.

I also want to get my running routine...well up and running. I'm curious to see if a vegetable heavy diet will provide the sustenance I need to run multiple miles per day. Once I get the juice/solid food ratio figured out I'll get back into the gym to do some lifting.

I want to take the time to thank the people who have posted reply messages. It really helped me to keep going on this short fast. 10 days doesn't sound like much but I have seen a lot of change in that short time. I encourage anyone who has been curious, to give it a shot. I will weigh myself in the morning to get a final weight loss but it is somewhere on the order of 8-10 pounds. I am much happier with the person I see in the mirror and know that it is just the start to achieving my ultimate goals. If anyone has any questions about my experiences with juicing, please don't hesitate to ask!

* Nutrition info (juiced **WHOA** and solid estimates)
* Better ingredient matcher (the old one was awful)
* New food system
* More accurate Health Benefit/Condition graphs
* Better everything

The nutrition info has been really popular and people have been wanting to know what their custom juices look like, so I had the [Juice Recipe Builder](http://juicerecipes.com/build/) created to help those people out. In the future, this will also be used for users to submit their own recipes to the site. A lot of thought was put in the functionality of it to make it as easy as possible to use, so I hope that shows.

But before I officially launch the [juice builder](http://juicerecipes.com/build/), I want to know what you think of it. Is it easy to use? Could your grandma use it? Is it as cool to you as it is to me?

I finally have the blends down to a delicous art.  ,20,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/18dnjv/third_time_on_a_juice_detox_i_finally_have_the/,"The first time I juiced, I bought up everything they had in the produce section and made really complicated blends.  They all ended up tasting a little weird and I always ended up wasting some veggies.  These are the simple blends that I find to be excellent:

**Breakfast:**

Mostly carrots, 

a couple apples, 

and MAYBE one orange (or strawberry)

SO SO good and sweet.  Because its based on carrots, I don't feel so guilty about all the fruit (which aren't *quite* as good as veggies)

**Lunch**

Lots of Kale, 

cucumber, 

celery, 

half an apple.

This is more of the ""chore"" one since I don't like the tast of Kale, but its the best thing next to wheatgrass that you can juice.  The half an apple makes it taste better.
Also, you don't get a whole lot of juice out of the kale, so the cucumber and celery help add a lot of juice without adding a bunch of sugar.

**Dinner**(FAVORITE!!!!!)

Tomoates - enough to get a good base about 1/2 to  of the serving

Celery - enough for about another 1/4

A little kale or broccoli, just for the sake of greens

1 lime

1/2 pepper - habanero or cerrano or jalapeno, depending on how hot. 

Cilantro

This tasts like a gazpacho, or cold tomato soup.  It is so freaking good.   I even put a little black pepper and garnish with a celary stalk.  I have actually used this recipe (minus the kale) to make Bloody Mary's when I wasn't even juicing.  If you don't like spicy stuff, just add a quarter of the pepper - it gives it a nice kick.

Added bonus with this, spicy foods make you feel more full and satisfied.  It's SO good. 

Of course, you should add more variety than just this.  Some days I throw in beets or spinach.  I also add ginger and garlic occasionally. ",,False,self,t5_2s602,1360681412.0,,,True,t3_18dnjv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/18dnjv/third_time_on_a_juice_detox_i_finally_have_the/,

- 1/2 bag baby carrots
- Handful of almonds/sunflower seeds (unsalted)
- Baked plain sweet potato 
- Lots of water!

- How I'm feeling: Very hungry in the morning; hungry after lunch.  Went home after work and felt better after having evening juices/carrots.  Sweet potato and nuts helped a lot!  Thought I wouldn't be able to sleep, but slept fine.  Was shaky/headaches, hard to concentrate at work.  

- Number of poops: 2

###Day 2, Sept. 2 2011 (Fri.)

- 8pm - 10oz juice (fennel/pear)
- 8:20 - handful of almonds

- How I'm feeling: A little sleepy when I first woke up, but super energized after first juice.  Felt like I had a caffeine buzz - but no caffeine!  Was a little shaky/headache during the day and before I went home, but the second day wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  Foods that saved me: nuts and edamame.

- Number of poops: 4

###Day 3, Sept. 3 2011 (Sat.)

- 10pm - Carrot/beet juice

- 3am - Edamame

- How I'm feeling: Woke up hungry and cranky, but no insomnia.  Crankiness may have been because Justin isn't here.  Felt energized after first juice.  It sucks not eating, but it isn't as hard (still) as I thought it would be.  Juice is starting to fill me up better than the first few days.  Noticing that my boobs are shrinking...usually they go first, and everything shrinks next!

- Side effects (positive): More energy, better attitude (positive), feel healthy, noticeable weight loss.
- Side effects (negative): hungry, headache, shaky, dry skin -- all mild.   

- Number of poops: 2

- How I'm feeling: Drank 2 drinks last night and was in a smokey bar...bad idea!!  I feel like shit today, fighting off a cold.  Doing ok with the fast, just shouldn't have went out.  Food advertisements are evil.

- 5:20 - baked plain sweet potato
 -7:40 - Carrot juice, cup of tea

- How I'm feeling: Not really hard, it just sucks when you think, ""I feel like popcorn!"" and you can't have it.  Juices are 300-400 calories each, so I'm still getting around 2000 calories per day, just in a different form!

- How I'm feeling: Still sick.  Wasn't hungry most of the day, but did get shaky around 3:30pm.  Had slight stomach heartburn (cough drops??).  I wish I wasn't sick so that I could get a better idea of how the juicing feels on a normal day.  Poop is orange/red from carrots/beets.  I find that if I don't eat every 2 hours or so, I get very hungry...but if I eat I feel ok!  Skin is no longer dry, it's kinda glowing!  Starting to notice weight loss, pants are loose.

Cravings were strong today, pizza and popcorn.  Even the canned cat food looked and smelled good!  It's really all mental because I haven't been hungry at all, just craving different flavors.

- Number of poops: 4

###Day 9, Sept. 9th 2011 (Fri.)

- 8am - banana, 16oz glass water
- 12pm - Juice, carrot sticks, almonds, water
- 3:30pm - 10 almonds
- 4pm - Carrot juice
- 7pm - 2 small red plain baked potatos

- How I'm feeling: Felt ok most of the day, not too hungry.  Went out with coworkers for after-work dinner/drinks, just had water.  They had an appetizer plate and they looked/smelled SO good!  I got through it by just saying that I wasn't going to eat anything.  On the drive home, I was very hungry since I hadn't eaten in a while, so stopped and got potatoes.  Wanted something more hearty than juice.  

- Number of poops: 1

###Day 10, Sept. 10th 2011 (Sat.)

- 10am - Juice, 20oz water
- 11am - banana
- 1pm - Small red plain baked potato
- 2pm - Juice
- 4:30 - 20oz Juice (fennel/spinach/cucumber/celery)

- How I felt: Feeling accomplished that I went the whole 10 days!  Didn't lose as much as I thought I would (but I also didn't weigh myself, so I'm not sure how much I actually lost -- my guess would be 5-8lbs).  Clothes are fitting much better.  Going to eat some ""real"" food tonight (friend's birthday).  Hardest part will be maintaining.  I didn't poop as much during the cleanse as I thought I would.  I am starting to get tired of the juices.  

- Number of poops: 1

###Followup

- On Sept 10th, at 8pm, we went out for my friend's 30th birthday celebration.  Since it was the end of day 10, I broke my fast.  They say you are supposed to ease out of a cleanse by transitioning with salads/vegetables/lean meats, etc.  I didn't do that...I jumped right into the bad food, which was a mistake.  Here's what I had:

- A small personal flatbread pizza (didn't eat the whole thing)
- A couple bites of white cake
- 1 mozzarella stick
- 1 potato skin
- No alcohol; had about 4 glasses of water because I was so thirsty!

- I shouldn't have ate all that food without a transition.  The cake tasted awful, super sugary and processed.  The potato skin was really greasy.  They also had ""funnel cake fries"",  I tried one and couldn't even eat them because they were so gross.  

- Side effects: Headache, heartburn/stomach ache, constipation, greasy film in mouth.  VERY puffy eyes the next day (probably because of all the sodium).  I want to go back to the juice...  I did get lots of compliments on how I looked.

###Day 11: Sept 11 (Sun.)

- ....10:30am - 20oz freshly juiced fresh organic orange juice.  :-)
- Juiced the whole day
- Dinner: Edamame, miso soup, and 1 Tuna Roll (Sushi) (only ate 5 out of 6 pieces) -- dinner was very salty and my stomach rumbled for an hour after I ate.  I was very full.   

- My plan is to integrate healthy foods into the juicing.  Will probably continue to drink 2-3 juices a day.  I feel great!   ",,False,self,t5_2s602,1357785781.0,,,True,t3_16affz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/16affz/a_little_over_a_year_ago_i_did_a_10_day_juice/,

I'm a 25 year old chick... on day 2 of my 15-day juice fast. I am one of many who got my inspiration from Fat Sick &amp; Nearly Dead. I'm about 5'7"" and approximately 190 pounds (god I hope my husband doesn't see this!) I have always had problems with eating habits, yo-yo dieting, eating disorders, body issues, etc. I have always been a comfort food eater in my habits, and the foods I choose. My favorite thing in the world is sausage gravy. I'm somewhat stout, I guess you could say; it runs in the family. So I had finally got to the point where I was just content with my body and figured ""What the hell, I'll eat what I want, who cares about calories and fat? I'm going to enjoy myself"" Until I saw this movie...then something clicked in my brain. It was a voice telling me I had to do this, so I started looking at juicers and doing my research. I got my juicer 5 days later. So it's been about a week since I had this ""Click"" in my brain and I'm more motivated to do this than I have ever been to do anything in my life.

 I want to do this for me, and nobody else. I want to feel better from the inside out. I wake up every morning feeling so tired and groggy, so fat and so lazy. What kind of a life is that to live? I could tell myself a thousand times ""Who cares about the fat and calories?"" But when I look in the mirror, I'm not happy with the reflection. I want to lower my risks of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and heart attack. I want to wake up in the morning feeling rejuvenated, happy, and whole. I currently take two medications. Zoloft 75mg daily for anxiety, and Ativan 0.5mg when needed for major stress situations. I'd love to eventually get off of these pills because I'd like to have a baby within the next couple years.

 When I first decided to do this I just wanted to drink the mean green the entire time, but obviously I know that wasn't realistic. I need two different drinks (at least) one for my salty cravings, one for my sweet cravings. 
So I have granny smith apples, pears, peaches, cucumbers, celery, carrots, kale, ginger root, grapefruit, oranges, grapes, tomatoes, and blueberries. I'd say I'm pretty set. I want to get the most out of these fruits and veggies. 

One thing I've been concerned with is losing all the skin off of the food, I know that stuff is rich in nutrients and when I throw it all out from the pulp extractor I feel almost, guilty. Is that okay? Has anybody else had these feelings? I have been getting a little sad, or depressed that I cannot have food. But then my husband told me today, ""It's not that you cannot have food, you can have all the food you want, but you won't"" and that made me feel really happy, and very proud. So I guess what I'm asking here is for experienced juicers to give me some feedback, what have you experienced? What do I have to look forward to? Did you struggle with self-sabotage? I told my husband if at the end of day 15 I want to keep going, I will and maybe even 60 days, he basically said for me that would not be healthy. I know that this is the right thing for me to do, I guess sometimes I just feel I need a lot of reassurance that everything is going to work out for the better, I am going to succeed and live a longer, healthier, happier life because of this.

I dropped down from approximately 400 lbs to 323 lbs, thanks to a 60 day juice fast. A lot of things happened in my life after I finished my juice fast, I quit my job, moved to a new apartment, and got into a pretty bad accident with a tractor trailer, and now I'm trying to finish up my Master's thesis this semester. Beyond that, I lost a really close friend to me recently and that has put my health back into focus for me. I just weighed myself for the first time since my last juice fast. I'm currently at 350 lbs. I've gained 27 lbs back since I came off my first juice fast. 

I started my 2nd juice fast on Feb. 19th. I'm aiming for another 60 days, and this time, I have a better exit plan than I did last time. My strategy last time was to take a two week break and go back to another juice fast. What I plan to do this time around is to bounce over to /r/paleo after I finish my fast and attempt to establish my basal eating habits as being low carb and paleo in nature. After that? I'm going to continue doing intermittent juice fasts of varying lengths depending on my weight loss as well the effects of my diet on my psoriasis. 

This 2nd go around has been much more difficult than I remember. I don't remember getting headaches during my first fast, whereas this time, I had a horrible headache all of Wednesday, though I'm not sure if it's the juice or stress, or some combination of both.

I love savory smoothies with garlic and cilantro and tomatoes.

I'm almost there, **just two more days to go to meet the 60 day goal!** I'll be posting my graph the day following day 60 to make sure I get the full day. 

I've learned so much and will share all my information with you. I am hoping to use this weekend to digitize all the handwritten recipes I've experimented with through my journey [also hoping for a produce breakdown]; a bunch of stats that I collected and the forecast from day 60 and on.

I totally foresee one or two more fasts coming up to get exactly where I need to be; in the meanwhile I am planning to transition into a hybrid mode - details will follow in my summation for this first journey :)

So now when I juice I juice for for two (larger batches as well as different flavors). I can drink just about anything but she prefers sweeter juices (most folks that start off do as well). 

So to start easy I made a breakfast juice of strawberries, oranges, apples, celery, carrots as a base (common to both her and my juice). I love grapefruit and she doesn’t so I kept the grapefruit to the side until I completed her portion; mixed the juice thoroughly and separated her portion; then juiced my grapefruit into my remaining portion.

I also noticed that she liked her juices chilled for longer periods of time so I ended up grabbing the old blender and filling it half with ice and then pouring the portion of her juice in the blender; setting it to a low ‘stir’ and it crushed all the ice up making a super frosty juice (quite slushy-like). Threw in a straw, did a taste test and handed it over.

This is my second question in like 3 days, so thanks in advanced for being a font of wisdom for me while doing this.

Two things, first being my detox phase. I am a big guy that has eaten a lot of unhealthy stuff. Dollar menu was hit up daily before starting this, so when I hit my detox stage I was terrified it would be horrible. Turned out it was not so bad. Lasted two days, I felt I guess foggy and unclear during them, but after that amazing. I guess I'm worried I've done something wrong. Fat Sick and Nearly Dead made me think the first few days were worse than death.

Next, hunger. I haven't been. Like, I'm not hungry at all. I get a bit hungry, so I juice a bit, then it's gone for hours and hours. Generally I try and drink 3 20oz bottles a day, but I found myself drinking my morning juice, sipping it between 9-11A, and not wanting to even think about eating again till 4 of 5. I am active too, not hugely so, but being a nearly 500 pound guy who doesn't exercise, I figure 15-30 minutes of walking is nothing to sneeze at. Is this normal, to just feel so satiated from juicing?

In the summer I was around 150 lbs with a body fat percentage of around 11%.

Now I'm around 180 with a body fat percentage of around 15-16%

I'm not really overweight or anything, but I don't like where it's heading and I've had some trouble fitting in some of my pants recently.

So far seems to be satisfying my hunger pretty well (I'm hungry just about *all* the time normally). So far I've made a variant on Joe Cross' ""Mean Green"" and for lunch today I'm having a juice made from: beet tops, spinach, carrot, apple, and a bit of ginger. `[](/notbad)`

I'm planning on doing this for one week and reevaluating at that point to see if I want to go 10 days. After that, I'll probably just do the juicing as a meal replacement or possibly with meals.

Between fasts I just ate clean and continued to do yoga and some light kettlebell work to get ready for the next stage. Judging by the weight i've lost so far i'm guessing I still have another 25-35lbs of fat still to go but want to really start weight training.

Could I start throwing some whey powder into my juices for protein or is going the keto route after next week when my fast ends a better option now that more muscle sculpting is my next goal.

But one thing I can't get over is this fascination with wheatgrass!

[Virtually no research has been done to support ANY of the claims for the benefits of wheatgrass, other than one which suggested it might help with colitis, a bowel problem.](http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/DietandNutrition/wheatgrass)  What that means is that there is no evidence for any of these claims.  NONE!.  And beyond this, [studies have shown that wheatgrass contains less nutrients than say, a regular vegetable.](http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/health/HealthRepublish_1634415.htm)  The original claims by Ann Wigmore in 1988 included that it cured cancer and AIDS.  Mind you, she was into natural medicine and was *not* a doctor.  

Now, everywhere you look, you see the paragraph of claims of what wheatgrass does, like ""balancing your blood"" (what does that even mean?) and ZERO research to back that up.  Each health site cites ANOTHER health cite making the same unsubstantiated claims.  They're using baseless information to sell you something you don't need!

I don't mean to be a party pooper, I'm completely down with juicing.  I've been juicing for a week (2-3 per day plus dinner) using only a food processor and strainer, and the amount of time it takes this way (my juicer is being shipped) means I'm serious about it.  I've had the focus to read everything I can about juicing in anticipation of getting my actual juicer.  But try as I might, wheatgrass is a load of woo I can't swallow.  I'm a skeptical person.  Micronutrients, I get.  Unsubstantiated research...not so much.

For the first time since starting my journey I went to see a bunch of friends this evening. Ironically it was at a soft opening of [a restaurant](http://www.searsucker.com/austin/about/). Wisely, I ran home before going and juiced my evening meal, knowing if I didn't the temptation would most likely be the end if my road.

I show up and the free food and booze is flowing and being passed around. Certainly, I would have liked to have a morsel or two, but overall, I was content to hang out. Then they began to mention I looked good. Healthy. Ask if I had dropped a few lbs. I said I had, but didn't mention that I hadn't taken a bite of anything in over two weeks. I just said yes I had and thanks. But I could feel it. Even just a little.

I felt it when I reached in my closet and began to worry less about what might fit appropriately. I felt it when I walk down the street, a little taller and more comfortable in my body and appearance. I felt it when I looked at the burgers and desserts and saw them as impediments rather than indulgences.

So I went on the Breville site looking for an answer.  I ended up using their contact form and I explained the issue, asking them for an idea of what the problem might be.  I left my phone number.

Today I got a call from Breville support.  The guy talked to me about the issue, suggested a 'fix' of a new filter screen.

He was able to take my order over the phone in about 1 minute, as they already had all of my contact information.  

Yes, Breville made a sale ($31.00) but that is not a problem.  The good part was that they replied to my web query with a phone call, the guy I talked to knew the products and was able to recommend the fix, then they were able to take the order over the phone in about a minute.

I am about 5'6"", and hover between 205-208. I've already lost about 10 pounds in the past 2 months due to stress. But, I'm starting to gain back some weight now that I'm getting settled and am in a relationship again.

After watching Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead and then Food Matters I decided that a juice fast and then sticking to a diet of 51% fresh/raw food per plate, and cutting out most processed foods will be best for me. I suffer from Depression and Anxiety, as well as Bipolar II, and have been on so many different types of medicines I could've opened a pharmacy. I honestly feel I could greatly reduce symptoms simply by eating more raw foods and getting more vitamins.

I wasn't sure about making the investment into a juicer until I knew I'd like the juice, so I went to Goodwill and bought an older model Hamilton Beach (CJ08) for $10.  I juiced an apple last night, just to make sure the juicer worked. And it does! Hooray!

I made my first ""real"" juice this morning - an apple, an orange, a little lime, a stalk of celery and a handful of grapes. It was really good and actually a little too sweet for me. I think I can add a little more vegetables and less fruit next time. I love fresh lime, so I think anything with lime will taste great to me.

Anyway - I have a few questions for the more experienced juicers out there!  Thanks for your help!

1.  My juicer seems to spit a lot of fruit into the pulp catcher. Like, when I started with the apple, there were little chunks of apple in there. Is this normal? Is it maybe because it's an older juicer? Should I consider taking that pulp and feeding it back through? Or just let it go?  It seems like a lot to waste.

2. Can I make juices ahead of time? How far ahead of time?  I'd like to make juices at night for the next morning's breakfast because the noise is a problem early in the morning in my current living situation.  Feasible? Any suggestions?  What about making them at night for breakfast and lunch the next day?  

Thanks again! I'm sure I'll come up with more questions as I get started, I appreciate your support! ",,False,self,t5_2s602,False,,,True,t3_1cviwu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/1cviwu/beginning_juicer_have_some_questions/,

I bought my juicer over a year ago, mostly for nutritious reasons. After using it, I discovered that fresh fruit juice make awesome martinis!

I starting writing down my recipes and decided to post some of them here. I will put one recipe on here and /r/martini every Monday for what I am dubbing Martini Monday. Here is today's recipe:

**Salty Cucumber**

* 2 oz Juiced Cucumber with Peel
* 6 oz Tanqueray Rangpur
* Splash of Lime Juice
* Pinch of Salt

Add all of the ingredients to a large glass with ice.  Stir completely.  Add to a glass with a salted rim.  I prefer to use Himalayan Pink Salt.

*If you do not have a juicer, you can muddle the cucumber in a shaker, add the other ingredients with ice and shake.*

1359675937.0,13,self.Juicing,17nte4,Got a great deal on a Juicer. Now company trying to get full price or cancel order.,17,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/17nte4/got_a_great_deal_on_a_juicer_now_company_trying/,"Hello /r/Juicing, I'm not certain this is the best subreddit for this, but it seems as good a place as any. Last night I was looking into getting a juicer. checking out the J8003 per this review - http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-juicer/

While browsing amazon, I noticed that there was a J8005 listed for $111.54 and figured 'awesome, better juicer, great price'. So I quickly purchased it and went about my day. Today I looked up the order status, said 'shipped - usps- expected arrival 2/3 - 2/7'. Great! excited about getting my new juicer I went about my day.

Then around 4:30pm, I get a call from the amazon seller saying; ""we're sorry sir, there was a ""Glitch in the system"" this juicer is actually $259.99"". So I tell them.. I'm sorry too because I purchased the item at $111.54 and it says it already shipped. So you guys should probably fix that glitch. They then proceeded to ""offer"" me $12 off the list price of $259.99. To which I responded, No thanks I bought mine at $111.54. 

Anyways, They said they can only either cancel my order or give it to me at $247.99. That's bullshit right? They need to honor their prices, correct? 

tl;dr - Company sells me $260 juicer for $111, now they want full price or cancelling the order.


Update: sounds like it was Amazons fault. I basically let them off the hook. They gave me $25 off a j8003. It's later now, I'm less raged. *shrug*

Update 2: ended up calling back again.. felt frustrated and wronged by the experience. They agreed to give me the J8005 for $215. I feel like it worked out fair in the end. We basically split the difference in prices (obviously I took a bigger chunk, but it was a HUGE discount).

In the end, I feel like I can recommend this company to others, based on the way they handled the situation.(besides the whole call-center incident).  Now I can start focusing on the important part, learning some good juice recipes!",,False,self,t5_2s602,1359689713.0,,,True,t3_17nte4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/17nte4/got_a_great_deal_on_a_juicer_now_company_trying/,

I'm writing this a little over halfway through the day but I wanted to take advantage of the fact that I feel really great. Now this could be a combination of a great day of work, finally getting over my cold/cough, and not being as sore from soccer last Friday, but I will give juicing a little bit of the credit. All I want to do is go run! Unfortunately I don't think there will be time for the jog today but I hope to put this energy to good use tomorrow mid day.

I was beginning to lose sight of why I wanted to juice in the first place. I got a little distracted by the weight loss and I hovered around the 155 mark the last few days and got disappointed. What is most important is to cleanse and to retrain my palette for a mostly veg diet. I watched a pretty good documentary called Vegucated about 3 people going vegan for 6 weeks. Some of the numbers they were showing were a bit suspect but overall it was an interesting watch and and got me thinking about a vegetable based diet.

I haven't talked about it yet but I wanted to touch on my supplement regiment I also started during the fast. I've been taking an Omega-3, Kelp (for iodine), and multi-vitamin every day. I watched a good TED talk a while back [Link here!](http://youtu.be/KLjgBLwH3Wc) about a woman who overcame MS but changing her diet and getting the proper about of iodine and Omega-3 (among other things) into her diet. Both are critical for brain function but are hard to come by in the American diet. Iodine is widely found in seaweed sources. Anyway, it was enough for me to start experimenting with it.

That all being said. Day 6 has been a success. I'm crossing my fingers that the whole week brings me high energy and clear thought. If you're in the first half of a 10 day fast (or longer) keep it up!

This is a semi-comprehensive guide to juicing for me - you may have a completely different experience - but it could help someone start.


Juicing 101

No exercise necessary (thought it certainly helps)

SUPPLIES

Go out and buy THREE 1-gallon jugs. I went to the dollar store and got these pitcher things for $2.50/ea. Dollar store my ass.
My old roommate also bought 3 nalgenes because he brought the individual meal sizes to work; I just brought the whole gallon jug. You may want to grab one or two for times when juicing will be tougher/less convenient (AKA on the road). Believe me, juicing's always easier when you've got options on how to take it places.

Buy this juicer for $60: http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-Mouth-Extractor-67650/dp/B000FHQJ6C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349186645&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hamilton+beach+big+mouth+juice+extractor

Buy a stiff bristle brush for cleaning your juicer. I just went to the kitchen soap aisle at target and got one for like, $3. Believe me this makes life easier. Try to get thicker bristles as the smaller ones can catch in the juicing basket.

THE RECIPE (or, your SHOPPING LIST for the grocery store)

Note: you may have to adjust this. I buy kale in bags, for example, so I use 1/2 a bag for each recipe. Just try some different combos. Also, this should cost somewhere around $22. Try and hit up the farmers market for some stuff. 

Also note: This is configured to my tastes. I love the taste of this recipe, I know exactly what to buy, and I can make it in about 15 minutes. I don't mind drinking the same thing every day - you might. If you do, experiment with other recipes. Look online. Also, you can mess with this. Don't like the tomato taste? Don't put em in! But replace it with, say, another cucumber. Or with bell peppers. Or with beets. Onion. Garlic. Etc.

2lbs Carrots

1 whole bunch celery

2 Large Cucumbers

5-6 Roma Tomatoes

1 large yellow squash

4 Large Oranges

3 Large Lemons

2 thumb size pieces of whole ginger root (fresh)

1 Bag Spinach

1 Bag Kale

THE PREPARATION

You do not need to wash or peel any of the veggies, though I usually wash the celery cause its dirty, and I do peel the oranges and lemons because their rinds make it bitter. I also cut the bottom off the celery to make it easier.

Put a plastic grocery bag in the pulp hopper. This aids in clean up!
Thats it.

THE JUICING

Juice 1/2 of the Kale, 1/2 of the Spinach (you won't get much juice out of these but what you do get is PACKED with nutrients), 1.5 lbs Carrots (all the rest of the items, juice the whole thing. This recipe follows standard sizes of items I can get at the market next to me), Celery, Tomatoes, and Ginger (IN THAT ORDER). Just put everything in whole. Have one of your gallon jugs by the juicer, as you'll need to empty the hopper into it periodically. Once you juice the ginger, you'll need to clean your juice-basket (since the ginger's so fibrous, it'll clog).

Clean the juice basket filter thing with the brush you bought. Empty the pulp hopper. Put new grocery bag in hopper.

Juice the remaining ingredients. I juice the cucumbers last since they're so juicy they seem to rinse the juicer out - and bring the rest of the other juice with it.

Clean your juicer IMMEDIATELY afterwards. I just rinse it off of all pulp and crap. Once every couple weeks, I'll run the pieces through the dishwasher, but that warped my juice hopper, so be careful.

DRINKING THAT SHIT

I drink two large (22oz) glasses for each meal, though I only have two meals a day. 1 gallon will last 3 meals, or a day and a half for me.
In the beginning if you start to feel weak, just drink more juice! You can't really drink too much of it. The sugar in it will make you feel better. A small (8oz) glass will last you till your next meal usually. Though if you need to drink more, drink more!

After my first couple weeks, I would supplement the juice with just a bit of raw veggies to help fill me up. I might have a whole cucumber with a pinch of salt with dinner for example, or I would lightly steam some broccoli and put hot sauce on it. Find what works for you.
Also, when I wasn't going as hardcore, I would keep a bag of almonds at my desk. If I ever got hungry, I would count out 10-15 almonds, put away the bag and eat those. The fats in the almonds took away hunger pains.

Coffee is fine as long as its black. I found that diet soda threw off my weight loss, but that was an unscientific observation; YMMV.
DRINK TONS OF WATER. I used to drink a liter when i got in to work, a liter before lunch, a liter in the afternoon, and I tried to get one in before I left every day. It helps.

Odd notes about juicing: you'll fell a lot healthier. It was weird, my sense of smell/taste because MUCH more acute when I had juiced for a week. My skin cleared up, I felt more energetic (after the initial couple day shock).

Cost per meal is between $6-8. Buy in bulk when you can. Spinach, Ginger, and Kale are where I found I could save a ton by shopping around.

Juice will last about 3-4 days, though I've found my juice will get bitter at around that point. I still drink it, and haven't had any adverse affects, so I guess its fine (But - KEEP REFRIGERATED)

* ~10 Brussels sprouts

* Couple handfuls of chopped kale (or 1 handful baby spinach)

* Wheel of lemon about 1/4 inch thick

* 1 Red apple

* Half an English cucumber


Yield: ~16oz

Regular cucumbers don't taster nearly as good. English ones taste a little  sweeter. The lemon adds a little tartness but not too much, that's why I only use a wheel instead of half a lemon. Red apple adds a nice sweetness to it. surprisingly I like the kale better than the spinach. I used to add celery but I discovered I liked it better without it. I sometimes add a peeled golden beet which adds a nice earthy / root texture and adds some sweetness.

1.  What will happen if I don't wash veggies?  I know this sounds stupid but in the morning I don't feel like washing a bunch of cold vegetables and it deters me from making juice.  Is the main concern chemicals, or dirt?  Would organic be better?  Am I going to die?

2.  Does the complete omission of solid food contribute greatly to the effects of a juice fast?  For example, if I eat a little on Thanksgiving, will this restart some whole process?

3.  Can you heat savory juice, like a soup or broth?  If you just barely brought it up to warm, would it kill too much of the good stuff?

4.  I've heard juice starts losing some of its enzymes and such as soon as it's squeezed, but can you store juice in the refrigerator or freezer?  Is it still similarly nutritious (aside from enzyme activity)?

Sorry for all the questions, this is just the stuff that I wasn't able to find out myself.  Thanks.

We are on a health kick and both are trying to get fit. We've been working out every other day or so, with pretty strenuous sessions. 

Neither of us are necessarily planning on doing a long term fast, but would like to fast for a couple of weeks to shed a few extra pounds. 

My biggest question is: is it recommended or even just okay to keep doing our strength workouts during the fast? It seems like protein is a little bit lacking during the fast (I know it's not gone, but just not like a grilled chicken dinner or something), so I wasn't sure if this would effect our workouts and recovery since we usually eat a high protein meal afterward. 

Would it be a bad idea to drink a muscle milk or something like that afterward? How about adding fruit punch flavored powder to our juice? 

We are both brand new to this, considering we literally just got turned on to this 24 hours ago so we're not exactly up to speed yet on the do's and don'ts. 


On a side note, how many different ingredients are you guys typically putting in a single serving? My wife put a hodge podge of every last thing in that produce section, i think like 8-10 things, where I just put a few fruits in mine to get started. I despise veggies so I'm hoping this will help me get them in my system. I was pleasantly surprised at how good hers was though. Tasted mostly the cucumber, which luckily is about the only veggie I enjoy!

Juiced for breakfast and lunch, and we had vegan stirfry with miso marinated tofu for dinner.

It tasted heavenly, don't get me wrong.

With every delicious bite, I was convinced more and more that I am going to gain every bit of the 32.3 pounds that I've lost- back. 

Eating for me has become frightening, because it is the thing that got me morbidly obese in the first place.

So I'm female, 42 &amp; have been using reddit for almost 5 years.  This is an account I created just for the juicing subreddit as I don't want my gender/height/weight to be use for fodder in my other posting.  I generally keep my gender and age private - and good lord we all know Reddit hates a fat girl. 

I went to the doctor a few months ago for a yearly checkup.  I took a blood test and she told me that I was seriously deficient in almost every vitamin category and I was so low in iron, she prescribed iron.  She asked me if I ate fruits and vegetables and I admitted that I didn't eat very many because I disliked the taste of most green vegetables.  In fact, I cannot eat cooked greens and frankly a lot of other kinds of vegetables as they make me gag and throw up.  I can't even eat lettuce if it's even slightly wilted.   I physically cannot swallow them.   She was the one who recommended I get a juicer so that I could make eating vegetables a regular part of my diet - especially if I added them to carrot and apple juice.  

It just so happened I got my tax refund the next week and so I did some research and bought an Omega VERT350HD masticating juicer.  I picked that one as I have a tiny kitchen and this was seemingly the best of the upright juicers.  It does a great job juicing, and since it's the masticating kind my doctor recommended, apparently it doesn't heat up the juice as much as the other kind so it retains more enzymes. 

I'm not really wanted to state my starting weight but my starting BMI was an ugly 40.7. 

The first few days were tough, I'm not going to lie.  But after that it was incredibly easy.   I'm rarely hungry and when I am, I have a salad with low cal dressing &amp; 6 oz of chicken breast.   The few times I've needed it eat out for business purposes, I've ordered salad.  I also didn't give up coffee with my dollop of 2% milk in the morning.   I can only go so far so fast.. baby steps.    My doctor also recommend Vital Health Green Vibrant Powder until my vitamin levels are up.  It's expensive, alas, but I'm just making it a part of my food budget.  It tastes like... grass.. but has a shit ton of vitamins, pro-biotics  and a bunch of other stuff.. does it work? I don't know if it's hogwash or not, but if my doctor recommends it, it's probably not hurting.  I find it most easy to get down with my morning carrot/appple juice.  I have more vegetables in the evening and it just makes it taste even MORE vegetable like.  

After 2 weeks, I have lost an astonishing 17 pounds and am down almost 2 pants sizes.  For a female, this is incredible!  I have plenty of energy and feel just over all marvelous.  I have NO cravings for super sweet stuff like I did before - it's incredibly freeing not to crazy candy or cake or donuts or whatever.   It's amazing, actually.   

I will continue to post updates as they happen and I'm glad to have found this community of friendly and supportive folks.  Thank you to everyone who helps each other out here.  I've been following along and really like the supportive atmosphere.

1328376846.0,14,self.Juicing,pascc,Day 10 :),15,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/pascc/day_10/,"Here’s some interesting data and was wondering if this is unique to me or common among other juice fasters... 

I am on the morning of Day 10 [of 60] and skipped my evening feeding (aka dinner) for my afternoon feeding (aka lunch) I had consumed 4.0 cups of veggie-fruit mix and for the morning feeding (aka breakfast) I had 2.5 cups. (I also had one BM yesterday afternoon after the feeding). 

I figured I’d be hungry when I awoke this morning or low on energy but I’m still not feeling any affects of either being on a fast or skipping feeding times. As an experiment (for science) I am going to skip my morning feeding this morning (where I would normally have at least 2 cups [higher fruit than veggie ratio]). However I’ll prepare a 4.0 cups for my afternoon feeding when I go out or to have immediately if I feel anything weird (like headache, light-headedness, hunger pangs). 

Even though I am making sure that I am not consuming more than 10.5 cups each day. I’ve noticed that it doesn’t appear that I need to be consuming more than half that each day. I am interested to find out the limit line for me as it would also save on money if I am currently overeating. I calculated both on wolfram alpha and manually that I started out consuming around 600 calories a day (to where before the fast I was consuming around 5000 calories per day!!!) [when I started the fast I was 272#, male/37, 5’5”]. If I pursue this experimentation my calorie consumption will drop to around 300-400 calories per day. (it is concerning to me as I have heard this may be generally unhealthy or detrimental). Although I am only now bringing more outside walking and activities into my life I have generally spent most of my professional and recreational time indoors sitting on my butt. (which pretty much got me to where I am now over several decades of being inactive) 

I certainly don’t recommend new folks attempt this but I am just recording this so that I know my own limits and can tailor this period of juice fasting for my specific unique body.

Here's my typical juice meal (2 - 3 times a day)

* 6 celery sticks

* 5 carrots

* 2 apples

* 1 orange

* 1 tomato

= 3.5 Cups (28oz) of juice! 

I also drink black coffee but don't seem to have any of the issues that others have. 

During these 6 days I haven't experienced any type of headaches or hunger pangs, and my bowel movements have lessened in frequency. I go to sleep easier and wake up. I noticed that I am able to make better decisions and react faster. I feel 100% comfortable and confident that I will be able to do this for quite a long period of time.

What started this whole event was that a few cow-workers decided to weigh each other and then a few of us bet that we could lose a total percentage more than the rest. Only 3 serious players (including myself) decided to bet 100$. So far I've taken the elite lead. March 25th is the final weigh in and I see myself definitely ahead of the game and a lot healthier to boot. (win-win) The hilarious part is one of the vested players told me about this juicing fast to his chagrin. ;)

Hoping to inspire friends and family by being the proof of my endeavors. :D

Not sure why I didn’t learn about this sooner; or why the whole world isn’t doing this.

**tl;dr:**

* Made bet with co-workers on most percentage weight loss.

* Watched Fat Sick and Nearly Dead by Joe Cross on Netflix

* Bought a cheap GE juice extractor at Walmart

* Dropping weight like nobody’s business and getting healthier and feeling better!

Here at the end of my first official week of juicing, I am a little bit lighter, but a lot bit wiser. I am no longer wrestling the juicer and the kitchen no longer looks like someone went apeshit on the produce section when I am finished. I am starting to get a routine, and as of today, starting to feel confident enough to experiment a little.

It was Mean Green and me all day today for four servings. At dinner I had been really looking forward to trying [this recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/1fjg8q/amazing_recipe/) from /u/pakriika, so I did. The other thing was I have really been struggling with kale lately, because it sucks. So I posted [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/1fnqkc/kale_vs_spinich_vs/) to see if the nutritional gods would allow me to go to the leafy green shallow end with spinach. According to my own research and the consensus it seems, kale and me need to learn to get a long. So while at the store, I purchased some kale and some spinach. In the spirit of compromise, I adjusted u/papriika's drink by replacing lemon with lime, adding some tabasco, a couple of stalks of celery and a leaf of kale. And it was delicious. Surprisingly, it is more of a green drink than a tomato based drink, so it would make a really ugly bloody mary, but delicious and satisfying none the less. So I am calling it a Green Bloody Mary.

Now sit down and let's talk (pun intended unfortunately). Before I started this, I was wondering how my bathroom routine would differ, since the only fiber I would be eating would come from whatever does't get filtered by the juicer. I still don't have an answer to that, but I am a little surprised to tell you, nay warn you, just because you aren't chewing doesn't mean your body doesn't want to show things the exit door. And when it does, it isn't joking around. 

I have read of peoples experiences with constipation when they are juice fasting. I have had none of that. Quite the opposite actually. And this is a pleasant surprise. It leads me to believe my body knows exactly what it is doing and is using this opportunity to spring clean. this flesh machine we ride around is in a miraculous and wondrous thing.",,False,self,t5_2s602,False,,,True,t3_1fp328,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/1fp328/juice_fast_day_7_its_time_to_talk_aboutbms/,

Hello Juicers! I've been lurking here for a bit and had some questions for you folks, if you've got the time. I'm about to start a ten day juice fast for the very first time. I'll likely go longer, but I'd rather aim short and extend it as long as it's not interfering with getting things done around the house.  

Quick bio: 30 year old male, stay at home dad with a 7yr old and 1.25yr old. I've been going to the gym 3 times a week, mix of cardio and weights for general fitness. I stopped drinking soda about two months ago, then really stopped a month ago. I avoid the obvious traps like white bread and such, and I try to be good about checking labels. I've decided it's time to really, really get serious about being in the best condition I can for my wife and kids. 

So my questions to you, /r/Juicing are these:

* If you are / were a caffeine junky like me (I do love my morning coffee) how did you handle the withdrawls the first few days?

* Was there really a noticeable impact on your energy levels? I'm fine with juicing more to keep my energy up, but I'd really like to at least keep doing my regular cardio.

* Do you have any regrets about it? Do you wish you'd gone longer? Shorter?

* What would you have done differently if you could do it again?

* Did you track anything? How so? Would you?

Thanks for taking the time to answer whatever might apply to you! I fully intend to post a follow-up with progress and updates!

In the last week, I wasn't eating healthy, and I was over eating.  I was enjoying the sensation of being satisfied by food, as well as just the feeling of something good going through your mouth.

That week, my shit was pretty normal, maybe more excessive than usual, but everything formed, etc.

I started my juice fast last Friday evening.  Around lunch tomorrow will mark my one week of eating food.

I expected to shit a lot that weekend.  I figured all these veggies and juice only would clear out my system completely.  I didn't shit until late Monday.

It seemed mostly normal, except green with some orange bits.  Looks like my body has as much use for carrots as it does for corn.  Same thing Tuesday, then last night I had very loose bowels.  It had some red color I was a little concerned about, since I don't like red things.  99% of what I have been drinking is green.  Green and nasty.

But this morning was a while new concern.  I blew red chunks out of my ass that really has me thinking twice about this.  I later remembered that yesterday was the first day I tried purple cabbage, and I hope that is all it is.

Anyway, anyone else have some experiences they want to share?

Edit: Things got better after I got off the cabbage and radishes.  I used maybe 1/3 of a head of purple/red cabbage and 3 or 4 radishes (leaves and all went in).  No more red chunks blowing out of my ass, so that is a great relief.

I've been blending every now and again for years and years, but never saw much come of it. I stumbled upon this subreddit last Wednesday evening, saw the ""juicing without a juicer"" link, and went for it. I picked up some paint-strainer bags on my way home from work and ""juiced"" what I had in the fridge... Collard greens, carrots, peaches, with my trusty knock-off magic-bullet-blender-thing.

That got old real fast. It was a pain to wash, and a pain to use, and it took TOO LONG. So to CL I went! I got a kinda crummy juicer, but it does the job... Sometimes I'll run the pulp through again just to be sure I got it all out.

Over the course of the week, I've been juicing 2 times per day and having a meal packed with protein as well. Usually that ends up being dinner... but tonight when I got home from work, I didn't want ""real"" dinner, I wanted juice! 

I have a history of eating disordered patterns(ED-NOS, technically), so I'm nervous to start a juice fast. But its so good, leaves me feeling full, and I've had SO much energy for the last week... and thats only with juicing 2x a day! I can only imagine how glorious I'd feel when juicing all the time. Its an added bonus that there is weight-loss involved. Has anyone else dealt with things like this?

Also, I've been much more aware of how my body responds to the things going into it this past week. Last night I went out with my girlfriends and had a glass of hard cider as well as a whiskey shot. Both were proceeded and followed by glasses of water, but between leaving the bar and getting home, I got a killer headache. The only thing that I can think of is that my body is confused...

I woke up this morning and prayed for guidance and strength. Then I went to the grocery store and picked up fruits and veg. I love juicing. I love when my juices take 45 minutes to prepare and I put [Flying Lotus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uCyv05SG1g) on my headphones and dance around the kitchen with celery as my dancing partner. 

I will complement the juicing with yoga, rebounding, running, sunbathing, hot salt baths, meditating, plenty of rest, and a few different herbal tinctures to help strengthen my glands and nervous system. 

I drank this beautiful nectar of the gods, then layed out naked in the bright Phoenix sun, doing yoga and meditating, soaking up those rays. All the while [Iris Dement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9IfHLieQU) is playing on the stereo feeding my soul. What a great day.

Results, etc. here for anyone interested...",14,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/z8sux/today_is_day_6_following_my_30day_juice_fast/,"Hi, /r/Juicing! Like many others here, I saw *Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead,* then decided to try a 30-day juice fast. I am 31 years old, 5'8"" or 5'9"" (varies depending on who's measuring, somehow), and weighed 210 lb at the time. I bought a *Jack LaLanne's Power Juicer Express* from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond for about $80 (finally used one of those pieces of junk mail for 20% off!) and started going to local Farmers' Markets. Thinking it unwise to start without any transition, I spent a week weaning myself from caffeine and slowly replacing meals with juices. I also spent this week starting the [Couch-to-5k program](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml), which, conveniently, also has its own [subreddit](/r/C25K).

The first two days really sucked; seeing and smelling everything that my wife cooked would irritate me. Luckily, she is very patient. By day 3, juicing started to seem normal to me. The only reminders that it was, er, *different* were the occasional explanations to someone who didn't know what I was doing and needed some sort of explanation (houseguests, family, et cetera).

Generally, I drank 32 oz of juice daily with more if I still felt hungry (which was surprisingly infrequently). I also drank 128 oz (4 32 oz bottles) of water every day, along with some glucosamine supplements so that my knees didn't 'splode from running. The recipes from [here](http://www.jointhereboot.com/category/recipes/page/1/), [here](http://www.juicefastrecipes.net/), and, of course, [Israel Torres'](/u/israel_torres) [blog](http://blog.theproofisinthejuice.org/blog/recipes) were very helpful in breaking the monotony of drinking juice every day. For lazy days or weekends when I wanted to sleep in a bit, I would buy R. W. Knuden [Very Veggie](http://www.rwknudsenfamily.com/products/natural-juices/very-veggie-organic) or [Lemon Ginger Echinacea](http://www.rwknudsenfamily.com/products/simply-nutritious/lemon-ginger-echinacea) juice. I'm not sure if this counts as cheating, but if it does, surely it was a minor infraction, and a relatively rare one.

With my wife's support, temptations to break the fast were few and far between. However, I did have some vodka in my juice on day 7-ish. Maybe in 3 or 4 of my juices. I'm a little fuzzy on this point, as it turned out to be a [*terrible*](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4G2ptSlZZn0/SZMpFiNnYKI/AAAAAAAACN0/8Hrga0w3osc/s400/PeePeeWall.jpg) idea. I spent the next day apologizing for my caveman-like behavior and pounding water to fight the extra-strength hangover that followed. Fun! The last 4 days of my fast were spent at a family reunion, replete with barbecued meats and beer (both are like Kryptonite to me, normally). It was frustrating to explain over and over again that: (a) no, I'm not eating right now; (b) no, I'm not eating later, either; (c) no, I'm not sick or crazy; (d) thanks, but I don't want a beer either -- it is not a juice despite its physical state or origin; and (e) yes, really.

So, now I'll get to the bit you were probably skimming this to find. Over my preparatory week and 30 days of juice-fasting, I went from 210 pounds to 177.5 pounds. That's a number I hadn't seen in quite some time. It didn't really sink in until I picked up one of those jumbo bags o' kibble (31.1 lb) and thought ""this bag and I weigh less together than I did one month ago!"" Maybe my results are not-so-typical since I was doing C25K simultaneously (still going strong), but I now firmly believe that *anyone* who wants to complete a juice fast needs only a bit of willpower to make a positive change. Even though I wouldn't have considered myself ""obese"" before (large-framed, like a taller Gimli), I have still had a pretty drastic change in appearance and overall health.

Now that my fast is over, I am spending 10 days slowly building up to a mostly-vegetarian diet (today is day 6). My post-fast weight is actually holding steady for now, but I'm not going to freak out if it rises a bit as I begin eating again. I think I'll allow myself fish or chicken (white meat) 2 or 3 times per week while eliminating beef and pork almost entirely. Watching [Food, Inc.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1286537/) during the fast has convinced me to avoid processed foods whenever possible. Admittedly, [this sort of diet](https://www.drfuhrman.com/images/foodpyramid/foodpyramid-large.png) is new to me, but I am committed to keep at it. I have started tracking my caloric and nutritional intake with the goal of steadily whittling myself down to 165 lb (haven't weighed that little since Parris Island back in 2000) through diet and exercise. Who knows, I may even do another (albeit shorter) juice fast in a few months. We'll see.

Thanks for tolerating my perhaps over-long post, everyone! I mainly wanted to describe how the whole process worked for me, but if there happen to be any questions, I will gladly answer them. Also, I'd like to thank all of the posters here for getting the answers that I wasn't by my lurking! Remember, juice-fasting isn't too hard and can be pretty enjoyable. If you have the willpower, you can change your life for the better.

I just wanted to give you an update on how I am doing with my 60 fasting plan and quitting smoking.  I was/am 5’11’’, 265lbs, drinking semi-heavily, and smoking a pack a day.  I’ve been smoking since I was 16 and I am pretty much the last person that you would ever imagine doing this.  But I have two kids, and frankly they are much more important to me than all my bad habits.  My wife had introduced me to the Fat, Sick movie that is motivating so many people these days and I decided to jump on the bandwagon.  And so far it has been pretty interesting.
For anyone that hasn’t quit smoking, the sensation of cravings during quitting is very akin to hunger pangs.  Because of this, I decided to go cold turkey when I began my fast.  It wasn’t easy.  But at the same time, I’ve never quit for this long before so maybe the combination of fasting/no smoking makes it a bit easier.  Suffice it to say, I turned into the world’s biggest douchbag for three days.  My wife was incredibly supportive and really pulled me through it.

So looking forward to pizza right now.,12,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/1jjc1f/finishing_my_first_weekday_juice_fast_tomorrow/,"I haven't been around here in a while, but I gotta say juicing again makes me yearn for food. Especially on day 4 out of 5.

The beginning of the week started off strong, fresh off of a binge before I took the juicing plunge again. My recipe for Monday and Tuesday was whole packages of carrots, celery, tomatoes, broccoli, grapefruit (because I mistook them for oranges), and some blackberries I had in the freezer (had to use a blender for that). I also added some protein powder to ensure that I get my protein in because I work out daily, with every other day being most of my weightlifting. 

Gonna be honest here, mistaking oranges for grapefruit was a blessing and a curse. Why? Well I think the grapefruit helped curb my appetite every time I took a swig of that stuff. I was drinking roughly 2 litres of my concoction each day, maybe a little more. I can't say I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it got the job done.

Wednesday and today's (and tomorrow's) recipe was better, since I added a package of apples, a package of beets, and some kale to the recipe. Still on the 2L method, as I drink the second litre now I can tell you for sure that I have been craving solid food all day. It was bad walking home from the gym. I could smell someone's barbecue, and I think I could smell their potato salad as well. But I remain strong! I will continue my first 5 day fast until I'm out of pre-made juice, which I expect will last me through the first portion of tomorrow. 

One thing that's certainly helped was stepping on the scale before each workout session and seeing the dropoff that has occurred in a measly 5 days! I went from 260 on Sunday to 250 today! I understand that as soon as I eat some solid food that number's going to jump back up by a couple of pounds, but I think that's solid progress and I look forward to doing a similar fast before I go to my hometown next weekend.

Overall, this juicing session has been great for my morale while trying to lose weight. Hopefully sometime near the end of August I will reach my ""We'll see what I look like"" weight of 230.",,False,self,t5_2s602,False,,,True,t3_1jjc1f,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/1jjc1f/finishing_my_first_weekday_juice_fast_tomorrow/,

It also is a reminder of how long this road will be. I mentioned when I started how the days were clicking by quickly. Well now I am in the knee-deep mud of it. If I were to do this 60 days, I would be 2 weeks in which is just 25% of the total time. Or if it's about getting to a normal weight, I am down about 13 lbs now, which means I only have about 45 more to go. 

Fuck me.

It's not that it is that hard, or that I am starving or my energy is low or anything like that. It's not. My energy is up. Don't really get that hungry unless I allow it. I'm just bored.

Food for me, in addition to self-medication was entertainment. Variety. Flavor in every sense of the word. But the way I see it was I was on a very long, fun ride for a long time, and now it is time to pay for the good times. Don't get me wrong. Juicing doesn't seem like punishment, and I am feeling healthier every day. But I have to be honest and admit, right now at least, I am bored.

In order to help, I had some beets from the infamous farmers market I wrote about yesterday. I made [this Can't Beet It juice](http://juicerecipes.com/recipes/cant-beet-it-1). It was good, if not a bit earthy.

The thing I am trusting is that the price I am paying for the ride is worth it. For my quality of life. For my self-esteem. For my health. I know all of that to be true, and for those things I am certain a few weeks of boredom is a small price to pay.

What now?",15,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/1fu4ag/was_just_given_a_juicer_after_watching_fat_sick/,"So I am 28 and I'm just about to the quarter-ton mark. Seriously...when you start measuring weight in quarter-tons, it's time to re-think food consumption and exercise level.

So after watching the documentary Fat, Sick &amp; Nearly Dead, I was inspired by the truck driver. I weigh more than he did at the start, but to see the DRIVE in him to drop the pounds and to see how quickly the initial weight loss happened, I think I'm finally getting a fire under my arse to get control over my weight.

I was given a Juiceman 2 centrifugal juicer for free. I know there are many types of juicers, brands, wattages of the motor, etc. but I can't beat free.

I just tried it out today with a couple apples to learn how to operate and clean the machine, and I was AMAZED with the taste of apple juice. Unreal just how good it tasted. But thinking about juicing on a regular basis, I have two big problems: I don't really like fruit and I don't really like vegetables.

Fruits I can do apples and bananas, vegetables I tend to favor the high-starch of corn, peas, and the sweet carrots. I'll do iceberg lettuce if it's floating in a river of thousand-island dressing.

So given all that, what would you recommend I juice? Anyone here who juices on a regular basis that started out from a ""hates fruit and veggies"" attitude?








**UPDATE**

So I bought a bit of everything in the produce section today. Wanted to see just what I could do and what it would taste like.

Cucumbers: Half a cucumber produced an insane amount of juice. The taste wasn't too strong, but since I currently can't stand cucumbers I couldn't take more than a sip. I can see why Cucumbers are a base vegetable in many recipes.

Celery: One stalk produced quite a bit of juice. I can see why they're used as a base vegetable. The only problem is my centrifugal ejection juicer couldn't handle ejecting the stringy fibers of the celery and it got clogged and unbalanced the motor. Fortunately my Juiceman 2 is easy to clean, so 20 seconds and I'm back to juicing. Stronger taste and odor than the cucumbers

Lemons: I got rid of the rind and juiced the rest. VERY STRONG, but the sweet/tart combo would definitely help with bitterness.

Spinach: Here I get into the downside of my centrifugal ejection juicer. It did juice the spinach, but the spinach leftovers were still wet and the strainer basket got clogged. A half-handful of spinach produced under 1/4 cup of juice, but these are leaves not water balloons. Tasted THE BEST of everything so far.

Kale: Didn't try to juice because of my juicer clogging on the spinach. I will definitely make a salad tomorrow, though.

Red Bell Pepper: 1 whole pepper (minus the green top of course) made over a cup of juice. Surprising given they are hollow. Clogged my strainer basket but not nearly as bad as celery or spinach. I love eating cooked red bells but drinking a raw red bell is an acquired taste.

Of course the beauty of juicing is in the recipes. Something on their own might suck, but you can combine vegetables so the blended juice tastes better than each vegetable on their own. Plus you can add herbs, spices, and if the juice taste can't be recovered then you throw in an apple or two for sweetness.

Right now I think I'll stick to making apple juice and carrot juice as the juicer can handle those quite well, and in the future I have my eyes on an Omega 8004.

I am really feeling it now. I'm never necessarily hungry, but I want to eat everything. I miss chewing. I miss salt. I miss textures. 

I'm not whining. It really just reinforces to me how deep my food addiction had become. I is part of me and I can feel it starving away and driving my thoughts and intentions. This evening I seriously considered eating a meal. And you have to know whatever meal it was would not have been a salad. Partly because of my cravings. Partly because I was dreading having yet another serving of Mean Green for dinner.

But I manned up, found my strength and recognized I needed variety and something I enjoy.

I've had a bit of a headache today. I think it may be the drastic cut in calories along with not having had caffeine for days. And tomorrow will be another one.

So far most of my recipes have been fruit, but I've done a few with Kale/Celery/Cucumber.

Growing up, my family were not big on the fruit eating, so I'm thinking perhaps my stomach is not fond of the excess acid (I made grapefruit/orange mix, and my stomach really did not feel good after that), or is just very unused to digesting this much fruit at once. I just want to emphasize that fruits have never really been a significant part of my diet.

1) Is there anything I can do to minimize this stomach pain? Additives to juicing, supplements, drinking/preparing differently? I would rather not avoid more acidic fruits such as oranges/limes/grapefruits/lemons as they are my favorites... D:

2) If I simply continue to keep drinking juices will my stomach eventually adapt?

3) Anyone with input that's had similar experiences?

I am on day 17 and I have to say, i'm finally feeling the benefits! 

My first week was rough, filled with cravings, hunger pains, and gross-mouth! Getting used to actually having to put time into my meals was also a bit of a pain, as beforehand I survived off of fast-food and other junk that's quick and easy. I had a few headaches and my guts were incredibly noisy! I was a walking symphony and pretty nervous that my bowels would let go without my expressed permission.

I started reading waaaay too much about juice fasting and got very paranoid about a whole bunch of 'what if's and possible complications that (as luck would have it) have yet to actually surface for me. 

While in my second week I realized my cravings had gone down, and I wasn't yawning for the entire morning. Energy? Que? My mouth was also getting less and less gross by the day.

**I even managed to get through thanksgiving without downing the entire gravy boat! My greatest accomplishment!**  

Now at Day 17 I am really feeling the benefits of this fast! I'm no longer slamming down the 'sleep' button on my alarm clock, and i'm finding myself to have a brand new mental clarity. My anxiety has decreased substantially, and i'm being much more personable with everyone I meet.

It was never our intention to ""juice fast"" for any length of time, but rather to change our diets to include a majority of fruits and veggies - and also to clean up the rest of our diet by eliminating sugars, sodas, processed food, etc.

We did GREAT! We did juice fast for a big portion of the past two weeks with planned healthy food breaks every third day (we'd eat solid the evening meal). I lost 9 pounds, but even more significantly my head cleared up, my anxiety (from which I suffer to the point of being covered by the ADA) mostly dissipated, and body sensation increased (which I was not expecting, but pleasantly surprised.)

This past weekend we tried to bring in healthy whole foods. My wife spent practically all weekend in the kitchen trying to create healthy alternatives to our usual menu and she did a great job!

But starting yesterday and continuing into today, I've been struggling with depression like I haven't experienced in months (depression is another one of my 'issues'). I have narrowed it down to dairy as we had yogurt and shredded cheese. Silly sounding, I know, but I am wondering if anyone has noticed something similar when they try to go back to real food.

I just made my first juice and LOVED the taste.

We mixed:
3 heads of kale
handful of carrots
1 green apple
1 lemon
1 stalk of celery

It was so delicous, i'm loving it. 

Now I need a cheap juicer (under 50 bucks). Does anyone have any recommendations? I realize I won't have a nice juicer in this price point, but something that will last me a few fasts.

Right now i used a blender and a strainer to get all the pulp. This worked well, i had no pulp in my juice. 

Can anyone give me tips for starting out? I will be using the blender until I find a decent juicer for under 50 bucks. Amazon links are appreciated! I was at Walmart and Target and saw 3 juicers under 50. Black and decker and a GE model, and a juice man? 

I'm currently overweight and do not get hardly any veggies in my current diet. I hope to become more healthy with a juice fast. 10 days to start, who knows how long it could potentially go. 

A few more questions:

How can i prepare juice for multiple days? Do I freeze the juice? Refrigerate it in mason jars? How long will it last in the fridge? I can juice every day, but i'd rather make huge batches if possible.

Anyone have any recommended recipes? Today I bought:

Kale

Spinach

Cucumber

Apples Gala and Granny Smith

I'm about 30lbs overweight, and though I exercise, never get sick, never get headaches etc, I still have this feeling that if things don't change soon there will be problems down the road.

Everyone in this sub seems great and I've read through most of the posts, but still have some questions.

Juicing citrus: I've got a centrifugal juicer and plopping grapefruit and orange down there seems really inefficient...does anyone use the ""press and squeeze"" type for citrus or will the Breville do just fine?

Alfalfa/barley juice powders: Supplement/mix these with juice? 

Are B12/multivitamin/omega 3's: only necessary for longer term fasts 60days or + or are they necessary at all?

I've seen people say they have raised energy levels, but does that last? Are there fatigue issues regarding exercise?

I'm leaving the country in a few weeks and am planning to start on my return. Gonna do 15 days, see how it goes and may stretch it to 30 depending on how I feel.

1375198187.0,9,self.Juicing,1jcpvg,Questions for owners of masticating juicers,12,3,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/1jcpvg/questions_for_owners_of_masticating_juicers/,"Hey /r/juicing!

I recently purchased my first juicer after doing a bunch of research and reading reviews online. I was looking for a balance of price and convenience (both in ease of juicing and speed of juicing), and overall output quality.

As it was my first foray into juicing, and I wanted to make sure it was for me, I purchased a centrifugal juicer. I'm really enjoying juicing, and the unit I have works, but I've noticed some pulp seems rather wet compared to other pulp (for example, carrots seem to come out like slightly damp sawdust, whereas kiwis are sticky and quite wet).

In reading peoples' complaints about wet pulp from centrifugal juicers, I had assumed they were being overly sensitive and had unrealistic expectations. Now that I'm seeing the pulp coming from my juicer, I feel like their complaints had merit.

I'm considering returning my centrifugal and getting a masticating unit instead, but before I do, I have a couple of questions I'm hoping you can answer.

**Plastic Shavings**

One of the primary complaints on Amazon I read regarding masticating juicers was that the auger blade scraped against the screen, and as a result little bits of plastic were shredded off and ended up in the pulp.

Certainly I'd love to buy an all-metal juicer, but wow are they expensive. In light of that:

How much of an issue are the plastic shavings, really? Does the auger eventually reach a ""broken in"" point where the shaving no longer happens? Or once the auger has been shaved down to that point, does it need to be replaced entirely?

**Prep**

One thing I've read about masticating juicers is that they require more prep. How much prep is there, really, though? How small do things like carrots and apples need to be cut? Do leafy greens need to be cut up, or can I just feed them straight in? Roughly how long does it take you to make each 32oz serving of juice?

**Cleanup**

I won't say that cleaning my centrifugal is a breeze, but it's by no means difficult. The photos I've seen of the masticating juicers look like they wouldn't be any more difficult, but I thought it best to ask people who actually have experience.

About how long does it take? Any particularly tricky spots?

**Purchasing Advice**

Finally, what do I need to know that I might not know before selecting a masticating juicer? What ""features"" should I definitely avoid? What's nice to have that it's worth spending a little extra on?

I don't want to debate that or what not, but does anyone know of any greens that could take the place of these (spinach also has me worried due to the oxalic acid).  

I'm thinking of just sticking to carrots, beets, celery, ginger, lime, granny smith apple juice.  Is anything so amazing in these greens that I would be noticeably missing out on?  Maybe just adding wheatgrass a few days a week would suffice?

At any rate, am I just being paranoid?  Sorry for the 3rd grade like questions, as this sort of information isn't the easiest to find.

They were surprised by my weight loss.

I admit the smell was intoxicating but I was certainly not interested in breaking my fast. So we held strong!

3 days to go, I can see the light at the end.

It doesn't feel like 10 days since I have chewed anything. I sit at lunch with others at a busy restaurant, watching them all eat things that are absolutely delicious no doubt, but temptation doesn't appear. Not today anyway. I nurse my tea and talk while they enjoyed their lunches. I feel...content. Still. 

I go to see a movie. The lobby is filled with the smell of fresh popcorn. I walk by concession without a thought and go straight into the movie (which was horrible BTW). 11 days ago I would have gotten the largest tub of popcorn without hesitation or thought. While I admit it would have been nice, it didn't come to mind after I absorbed that initial waft or popcorn air.I feel...content. Still.

I drink my dinner and move on to other things quickly. Email. Reddit. Netflix. Even now I am feeling a little hungry. But not so much that it is distracting or has the power to steer me. I feel...content. Still.

My food addiction is no bullshit. It has been a friend. A comfort. An entertainer. A distraction. A hobby. An enemy. For the first time in a long time, today i didn't feel driven by it. I feel it releasing me with each juice like a new puppy on a leash resigning itself to it's inevitable fate. I hope so at least.

So the scale this morning was kind. A substantial drop over yesterday. Why was yesterday different that the previous 8 days? Who knows? It honestly doesn't matter. I stepped off the scale relieved to see some good results, but continued my day and my juicing as if nothing had happened at all.

Me and my food addiction need to try and figure out how to make good choices from now on. Not because my belt or the mirror says so, but because it's what my body needs and I need to get and stay healthy. Maybe not every time. But I will try. So today was a good day on the scale and in the pantry. Tomorrow will be too.

I ate pretty healthily until about 7 months ago when my boyfriend and I moved in together. Since then I've gained at least 20 pounds and I'm constantly exhausted. I'm hoping this will kickstart me into eating healthy again.

I've ordered my juice from a local business rather than making my own (the types of juices are similar to the ones Blueprint offers, but I guess they put more pulp into the juice AND it's like $80 cheaper). I'm sure some people will tell me that I should make my own, but A) I work 70 hours a week so the thought of spending time juicing on top of that is overwhelming and B) I think spending a crazy amount of money on 3 days of juice will actually encourage me to finish it. I'm definitely going to look into buying one if I enjoy this cleanse, but for now this is the best way for me to go about it.

Now, onto my questions.

1. Coffee while juicing. What are your thoughts on it? I typically drink 3 cups of black coffee a day. I don't have any intentions on cutting down in the future. Is it ok to still keep drinking a cup or two in the morning?

2. I've just ordered a bunch of fruits and vegetables to eat for the next few days before my cleanse starts, just so it won't shock my system too much. Is there any art to easing into the fast? Like should I wean off certain things in the three days leading up to the cleanse?

I spend a lot more then I thought I would on produce and I go through it very quickly even though I only juice 2-3 times a day. 

I use 4-6 types of fruits and veggies every drink. Am I using to many at once?

Is it really cheaper to buy at costco? It's winter time in Canada, so fresh produce (specially out of season) cost more this time of year, and theres really no fresh markets available. 

Just looking for advice on how to cut costs.

Seems like a lot of people are also starting a fast with the new year or just purchasing their first juicers. No better way to get yourself set for a year of healthy habits than with a juice fast!

So it's the end of Day 2 and I struggled a bit more. No headache but felt a little weak and had to nap in the middle of the day. I don't think I drank enough juice so I will up the intake tomorrow and hope I feel better. Will be interesting because I have a soccer game and it will be my first time running around in a couple of weeks. Won't help that I'm also on the back end of a cold and I'm coughing like crazy!

The cravings haven't been so bad, but I really wanted to pop open a beer with the rest of my friends watching some college basketball/football tonight. I'd like to cut back on my beer intake as part of my post-fast life but it seems nearly impossible as a sociable 20-something and beer snob. Anyone else out there in a similar mindset?

Looking forward to getting through Day 3 since I keep hearing how it's the turning point for a fast and it should get exponentially easier after. We'll see!

A little about me and why I'm juicing. I'm a 25 year old male, 5'8"" and 162 pounds. Not overweight by any means, but I've always carried fat around my stomach and have always been extremely self conscious about it. My eating and drinking habits have always been very inconsistent and I'd like to gain a little control.

I've also been a serial workout starter/stopper. Most I could ever do consistently is 3-4 weeks at a time. The last month and a half (before the holidays) I was going to the gym pretty consistently a few times a week and was feeling like I was making headway. But my waistline begged to differ. I was feeling like I could eat whatever and it wouldn't matter and slowly put weight on.

So here we are in a new year and I figured now would be as good a time as any to get my diet under control. I was told at the end of the year that a healthy lifestyle is 80% diet and 20% working out. I guess I'd like to get that 80% portion under control before I work the 20% into my daily routine. Like a lot of you I saw Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead and that was the trigger for me buying a juicer. I've juiced off and on for the last few months and I really enjoy it. I never had the motivation to do a fast though. Until now that is. I'm hoping it will be the start of a healthier lifestyle and in turn a body that I can be comfortable in.

It's the end of day 1 and my head is a little achy. I had two mean green juices and a carrot/apple/celery juice. I'm not really feeling hungry and I have been making sure to keep up my water (about a gallon/day). I'm hoping the tomorrow the headache will subside and I'll continue feeling full enough.

On a 10 day fast, are the last 5 days more or less the same as far as cravings/mood/hunger? I've always read that the first 3 are the hardest and after that things tend to smooth out. About how much weight should I expect to lose? Did you encounter any warning signs during your first fast that made you think it was a bad idea?

Should I have tried to keep as much of that white layer in the original cup and separated it before I mixed them together? Or is it just better off not juicing in advance.

By Day 4, the surfaces of my teeth felt rough and dry and my teeth felt extremely sensitive. Now, I drink quickly with a straw, at fewer intervals during the day and always have a piece of hard cheese or a regular meal with it. (One of the problems with acidic drinks is that it depletes calcium that protects teeth and cheese helps to replenish calcium levels.) My teeth no longer feels dry but still feels somewhat sensitive. I also chew sugarfree gum, to stimulate saliva production, which helps to neutralize pH. Of course, I'm avoiding citrus citrus and I'm going to also follow the advice of [Weston Price](http://www.westonaprice.org/) for holistic dental health, because even though enamel cannot be re-grown according to conventional wisdom, I'm desperate to reverse the damage I've done to my teeth. I hope to resume my juice fast in the future, once I've strengthened my teeth.

Also, I saw some advice online to rinse with something basic like baking soda dissolved in water (like in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/qirbz/helpful_reminder_about_a_juice_heavy_diet/)). IMO this be bad because you would be causing an acid-base reaction in your mouth and on your teeth. In chemistry lab, I was taught to flush out the acid with water if I spilled any on my skin, instead of trying to neutralize it with a base, for this reason. Sadly, I can't find an expert opinion on this online.

**tl;dr** I didn't use a straw and juiced a lot of citrus, which messed up my teeth. Please take precautionary measure to prevent acid erosion when juicing, especially with acidic fruit like citrus.

I've read quite a bit of methods like drinking 2 juices a day but warming them up first to kill the enzymes and eating a plate of juicy fruits like strawberries and such. Would that be a good way to start? Also how would you know when it's okay to start eating other kinds of solid foods after the initial phase into the transition?

So I am now on day 2 of fast 2 (2 fast 2 juicy) and things are going grand, totally feels comfortable and loving it. My wife also hopped onto this wave with me. Even though I never got a headache from during my juice fast she started getting one on day one. So I went through the numbers with her to see where things could have been going wrong. I prepared to 4 cup juicings for her (one for breakfast and one for lunch) (a total of 8 cups) and basically they were the same thing I was having as I now make for two on my VRT juicer. 

She developed an insane headache around 4PM yesterday and when I got all my questions answered it looks like she gave half her morning juice to one of my sons because he loves them [mistake 1]; then for lunch she had a small (2cup) juice from whole foods [mistake 2]. I explained that these cups were precisely measured for her and she needed to drink all of both of them otherwise she won't be getting what her body needs - and she will be fighting hunger and her instinct to eat. The result for her was a crazy headache that she regretted. I went to the fridge and took out the juice I made for her lunch and made her drink it on the spot. Within 10 minutes the headache was gone and she was once again chipper, she was also amazed as the quick change the juice did. She won't be doing that mistake again today. :) I think she figured that I didn't get a headache that she wouldn't either; but I wasn't lowballing my intake either. We'll also now start making little batches for the kids so they have their own optional provisions for a few days. 

I hadn't directly correlated this before and naturally this is the first time I've seen this first hand but it looks like the headaches folks may be getting could be because they aren't getting enough (right) juice throughout the day. I hope that helps someone out there having daily headaches when they start their first juicing journey. :)

I started a new graph as well as appending to the original one for a big widescreen look when it's all said and done, and will be posting updates as the days progress or become interesting.

I recently heard about this subreddit and decided to check it out, and I am quite interested in starting this. I've done some research and have a basic idea of what it entails. As far as the actual juices that I make, that I'm not completely sure. I did read the FAQ and got some basic ideas, but can I just like make a fruit juice in the morning (apples, pears, oranges, strawberries etc) and just vegetable juice mixing in like carrots, celery, cucumber and such? Also the portions confuse me a bit I've read that its best to drink 32-64oz of juice a day. Does that mean 32oz of just the juice or is it the juice with water? I found this [website](http://www.allaboutfasting.com/juice-fast.html) which following it will end up being 22 oz. 


Also a question about when to drink the juice. I work from 3pm-12am, go to sleep about 2am and wake up between 7-9am. Is there a recommended schedule I can try? Its going to be hard to drink the juice while at work since I can't bring the juicer in, so I was thinking of maybe freezing the juice and keeping it frozen at work then take em out maybe an hour before I drink them.


Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

Things are going grand. I'm feeling better than ever. During this whole process I've never had cravings, exhibited hunger pangs, headaches, anything of the sort. My nutrient intake appears to be sufficient and I drink water throughout the day (though not in excess) [probably equivalent to 3-4 bottles. I don't move around too much throughout the day unless I willfully go out for walks or Sun. (I'm mostly indoors for the most part)

I currently don't exceed 10.5 cups of juice per day and average around 8 cups (I usually drink a 4 cup lunch and may skip out on mornings/evenings - or have 1-2 cups). I keep my juice-blends to a higher fruit to veggie ratio in the morning, more veggie to juice for the afternoon and mostly veggie in the evening.

My body is showing visible changes that those around me notice starting with the face and upper body. My shirts actually show by draping over areas that used to be stretched out so often that they've maintained the shape. I am looking forward as part of the reward of my initial 60 day trek to get a new wardrobe. I had bought a belt before going on my fast and because I ordered it online turned out being shorter than I thought when buckled only had about an inch exposed. Now 18 days later has a good 5-6 inches exposed! All my shorts and pants can't stay on without a belt. (previously I wore a belt for utilitarian and aesthetic purposes but now I actually need one to hold up my pants!)

Since some folks have asked about BMs. My BMs have slowed to around every 3 days now, and they are substantial in mass, texture and consistency. 

I used to focus a lot on eating food but now on my juice fast it seems that there is now so much more time to do other things than think about eating throughout the day, snacking, desserts (coming from about 5,000 calorie intake to now about 600-800 calorie intake). Also I don't constantly have to think about finding a 'comfortable restroom' as I used to go about 5 times a day! I've taken up reading, walking, and other hobbies and less computer time (which I used to do so much). :)

FYI I will probably be posting this on other pages as well.

I'm on Day six and I'd like to ask for some advice.  I keep reading about people on day 6 and they are happy and focused.  I'm neither.  My stomach is constantly feeling hungry and I only get energy when drinking my first drink of the day which has lots of sugar in it.  


I usually have 3 juices a day(listed below).  My supper is around 5pm.  I don't usually have a 4th juice as I'm pretty tired by this point and don't want to bother.  I have [this juicer](http://www.hamiltonbeach.ca/hb_detail.php?item=67801&amp;mc=KA&amp;fc=3&amp;catID=26) and I've been told it is the type that doesn't make juice that can be stored.  This is because it is a ""non-masticating"" or centrifugal juicer (see: cheap) and it heats up the juice and will start oxidizing in about two hours.  


As I said, I'm always hungry and the only time I get energy is in the morning.  My main focus is to lose a significant amount of weight and I don't want to keep triggering my insulin with sugar as my metabolism is already effected by the amount of bad sugar I used to eat. In the morning I get up and have my breakfast and then go for a walk.  I walk about 5 KM at as fast of a pace I can and hope to move closer to 10 in the future.  I would like to continue for one or two months as I have a lot to lose.  I am 35, 6'6"", and weigh approx 370 lbs - my scale doesn't work over 350lbs :(.  I have lost 3 inches on my stomach and I'm very happy about that.


Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I started a juice fast three days ago and I actually ment to post this then but I'm lazy. I figure my first goal would be to drop my weight back down to 200 and see where I am and then go from there. I go to the beach on Aug 4th so I am really hoping to drop a fair bit in time. I plan on working out along with the fast because I figure its the best time to do so as I am not putting anything bad in my system I figure I would get a 100% return on my workouts.

I decided to try a fast because I have gained a lot of weight and I am unhappy about it. My eating habits are shit. I need a restart/reboot to get me back on track. 

So far on Day 3 it hasn't been so bad, though today I felt absolutely drained despite getting a full nights rest. I am very VERY eager to see this thru and see the weight loss happen. Not eating isn't so bad really. I thought it would be worse. Though holy crap do I want a cheeseburger!!!

ATTITUDE - Optimistic

So I finished Day 1 of my uncertain period of time juice fast.

This morning was my first taste of Mean Green. Not being a veg fan, I was dreading it. It wasn't good. But it wasn't as bad as I anticipated. Tart from the lemon, with some spice on the back end, I am guessing from the kale or ginger. Not sure.

The good news is I was never hungry throughout the day. I drank four 16 oz servings spaced throughout the day. I was also drinking water like a guy who loves drinking water.

The juicer itself is a fickle bronco that I am sure I will figure out how to bust in good time. My first go round was messy and uncertain. But I am confident I will become more adept at it as I continue.

For dinner, I couldn't bring myself to drink Mean green again, so I made myself [this Bloody Mary Juice](http://www.rebootwithjoe.com/bloody-mary-juice/), which was perfect. I made a few adjustments as the recipe was a bit bland, so I added half of a lime, a couple of dashes of vegan worcester sauce and a good helping of Chalula hot sauce. I strained it over ice to make sure it wasn't room temperature. It was hearty and filling and tasted perfect for a first day. Fair warning, the recipe made about 40 oz. of juice. I think smaller tomatoes next time.

I will say that around dinner time, even though I wasn't necessarily hungry, I was craving eating. It really demonstrated how much of my eating has been habit/boredom/routine.

^([The only places nearby are a publix, winn dixie, &amp; whole foods.])
* 30-45 days VS 60-75 VS 90+ days- which is the best?

* Good amount per day based on my height;weight;bmi;etc?

* For my partner who will be joining me on this venture?

Anyway, I just needed a place to vent a little. It's ridiculous because I was able to do it for 10 days before, making juice 2-3 times/day and cleaning it every time. What's once a day for the benefit of feeling great and losing the weight that I would like to in a timely manner?

I have juiced off and on as part of my diet for several years now.  This will be my first juice only stint.  

* My BMI is usually only around 6%.  I am a professional acrobat and do not have any excess weight to lose.  I am a little worried I may have to amp up my caloric intake, compared to a weight-loss oriented juicer, by several liters of juice per day.  Any advice on juicing and keeping the kilos?   The last time I did a serious juice I dropped about 3 kilos in a week, I was almost too weak to function and had to get back on eggs and bread.  In this juicing I will be off work all winter, and so can afford to go full tilt boogie, unless it makes workouts and practices impossible.  

*  My SO is mortified.  My girlfriend refuses to see the juice diet as a positive and it really stresses me out.  I have shown her Fat Sick and Nearly dead, but she is unconvinced.  Any further literature would be appreciated.   

As a final note I should say that I'm embarking on a full juice because I just love the way I feel on it (even though I am not 100% natural; almonds, coffee, an occasional beer with my lady).  

Any advice on how to sway my SO, how to keep my current weight, and how to just juice better would be greatly appreciated.  Happy juicing redditors.

You may recall from my earlier [**post**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/zdcb0/starting_a_60_day_fast_tomorrow_blog_link_for/), that I committed to a 60 day juice fast at the beginning of September. Well, I made it 30 days and it has been quite an experience! 

I've been strictly on the 'mean green' mixture, water, and 1-2 whey protein drinks daily. I've adjusted my intake several times over the last month, but have finally settled on about 60-70oz of juice a day. 

In addition to the diet, I've been doing 45 minutes of cardio 5-6 days/week consisting of elliptical or treadmill running. I think this has definitely helped.

**To date I have lost a total of 33.2lbs!**

9/4/12 - 214.2lbs

10/4/12 - 181lbs

Needless to say, I'm thrilled with the results to date. I don't have much more to lose, I'm thinking 170-175 is good for me. I'm starting to plan my exit strategy. I know that I will balloon back up if I don't change my eating habits when I re-introduce solids back into my diet. I'm also looking into the P90(starter P90x) program to get toned up.

I have been blogging about my journey here if anyone cares to read. This sub-reddit has been a huge inspiration for me and I thank you all for the wealth of information!

I happen to run into ""The Fat, Sick, &amp; Nearly Dead"" on netflix last week and it has inspired me. i've did some research and came up with a plan. I'm hoping someone with more experience can tell me if I'm going down the right path.

Some facts about me
--------------------------

27 years old (28 in two weeks).  
310lbs
5'11""
I have lived a very sedentary lifestyle for 3 years (sleep, work on a computer all day in my home, sit in my recliner and watch tv, sleep)
Health issues - obese, sleep apnea, lower back pain nearly constant, knee pain when standing, feel like death if I'm active.
Past diets - I did adkins about 6 months ago and it worked for me, lost 15 ilbs in three weeks then I got tired of the food and quit. I have gained it all back plus about 10lbs more.

========================================

My Juice Plan
-------------------

* 07 days of un-eat
* 03 days of smoothies (juice with pulp)
* 10 days of juice (made with juicer)
* 03 days of smoothies (juice with pulp)
* 07 days of re-eat

-------

My ""Un-eat"" plan
---------------------

GIVE UP -

* alcohol
* tobacco
* margarin
* vegetable oil
* fried foods
* salt
* artificial sweetners 
* caffeine
* dairy (replace with almond milk during un-eat)
* gluten
* processed foods
* meat
* sugar

I will begin to increase my intake of raw salads, fruits and vegetables.
Also I will eat more soups, lightly steamed vegetables, and brown rice, tuna and almonds.

Two days before the cleanse I will try and eat only raw salads, veggies, and drink only fruit juices and water.
   
I'm going to drink lots of filtered tap water. I like water with lemon too. I hear lemon juice is very cleansing and it will also help you start to flush out your system?

Plan is to have 16 oz hot water with lemon in the mornings 3 days before the fast and throughout.

----------

During the Fast
---------------------

Some points:

* DO NOT take multivitamins
* DO take flaxseed or fish oil supplements for the omega 3 and 6 (?)
* walk regularly
* nap when I need to, rest a lot
* drink plenty of fluids

I plan to do the ""mean green"" juice for my 16 days of no food, 6 times a day.

Start out with 3 days of Mean Green smoothie made in a blender so the pulp is included.
Follow with 10 days of Mean Green made in a juice so there is no pulp. this is to give my colon that all-needed rest.
Finish off with 3 days of Mean green in the blender again, to help my body re-adjust. 

--------

7 days of Re-Eat
--------------------------

Start with small amounts of soups, berries, whole fruits and vegetables.

By day 3 have salads, veggies, and fruits regularly

day 5 add back dairy

by day 7 be on a regular food diet of 70% veggies and 30% other (bread, meat, pasta, etc) for the future!

Eat healthier than I did before. Try to avoid sugars, refined, fried or processed foods, bad fats, and excess carbs. 

------------

Mean Green Juice
---------

* 6 Kale Leaves
* 1 Cucumber
* 4 Celery Stalks
* 2 Green Apples
* 1/2 Lemon
* 1"" piece of ginger

Anyway, I'm a 16, 5 foot 7 inches, and currently around 125 pounds. I have noticed that most people who juice fast are, well, overweight. So the weight loss resulting from the fast is extreme and beneficial. If I were to juice for 2 meals every day, or maybe all 3, would I lose even more body fat, or would it stay steady? It would still be healthy, and not dangerous, right?
I know you're not experts on my body or every body, but if anyone has some experience with juice fasting on my body type and has some advice or warnings, anything would be appreciated.

1327979554.0,8,self.Juicing,p40c3,TIL I learned the definition of bitter,9,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/p40c3/til_i_learned_the_definition_of_bitter/,"It started innocently enough.

I was looking for something super nutritious. For something that I don't usually eat so I could give my body a new and exciting set of nutrients to go nuts with. In the grocery store, I got the usual carrot, celery, oranges, etc. but this time also went for the papaya, pumelo, and the grand marshal of the event:

ALOE VERA.

I take all my wondrous plants home, whip up a quick apple juice to drink along the way, then get to work on the aloe. I excitedly rinse it off, peel off the skin, rinse off the slick and start jamming the slippery, jello-like flesh in to my juicer. I start putting the solid matter back through the juicer, to ""get the full effect,"" as the evil side of conscious said. At the finish, I was left with ballistics gel in one container, and about 2 shots of gelatinous, muck-like syrup in the other. 

Being filled strength that only foolishness could bring, I finish the last of my apple juice, then take the viscous shot of what is purportedly the nectar of the gods. At that instant, I immediately find out exactly what kinds of gods endorse aloe vera.

I had assumed that my mouth would be partying with Aphrodite, flying amongst the clouds to the tune of a symphony about creation and springtime. And indeed there was a symphony, but it differed somewhat from my expectation.

The god I was instead met with was Mars, the god of war. With this drink, my disillusionment came by baptism of fire. This potion is hell bent on destroying everything it doesn't like, and really doesn't like sissy things like ""flavor"" getting in the way. And in the end, though I may have won victory by way of this war-rider, by what cost was victory had?

The term bitter would be appropriate though ineffectual here, as the thick aloe vera shot goes way past your definition of bitter. The experience is remarkably horrid; a brilliant symphony of rot and disaster that is brought to transcendence through flawless execution: the substance does not seem to realize that it is unwanted.

Due to its highly viscous nature, it is not only very difficult to ingest but also clings to your mucous membranes. I won my first victory by managing not to spit it all over my kitchen, but did not do so well at the next task of swallowing. Just a bit got caught in my windpipe, inducing a fit of coughing. This fit, of course, prevented me from alleviating the war crimes being committed in my mouth, as I was unable to drink water.

After what seemed like years, I finally regained the upper hand, drank about 3 gallons of water, and achieved victory. However, the effects still linger. I am still clearing my throat and can still taste the aftermath.

I shall wait for my will to recuperate, and then over the next few days I shall submit myself to that terrible swift sword and drink the remaining 9 Aloe Vera leaves.

A couple questions:

(1) I used bagged (but fresh) kale and just threw in like 4 handfuls, does that work as well as buying it on the stalk?  I noticed that there were a lot of leaves in the pulp catcher.  Is it okay if I only get a little bit of kale juice out?  I know it is quite potent.

(2) I haven't used beets yet, but can I throw in raw beets?  Should I used boiled beets?  

(3) How have you found is the best way to maintain your juicer?  What techniques seem to work?  When to put it on high and low?  Do you start the engine and then drop in the ingredients, or do you drop the ingredients and then start the engine?  

(4) What are some of your favorite recipes?  

(5) What are your favorite recipes with lots of veggies (that still taste good)?

Did I mention I co-own a bakery? Ironic right? It's a small start up. The point of me mentioning it, besides the sheer ridiculousness of the situation, is that yesterday, from a juicing and personal willpower standpoint, was simply disappointing.

For all of my talk the day before about preparation, I wasn't. Sure, I made my juice for a couple of meals. But Sundays for me are a long, arduous grind and I wasn't prepared. At all. 

See, the bakery sells at a local farmers market on Sundays. We make everything fresh, so my day starts at about 5:30AM. So the morning comes in all it's quiet darkness, I grab my premade bottle of food and begin the day. I drink at about 8:30. Take the offerings to market and while there, drink the remainder of my ration at about 11:30AM. 

As an aside, it is hard to convey the amount of pure goodness surrounding me while I hand people fresh croissants and loaves of bread still warm from the oven. All the while people are offering me samples of new goods and the smells of freshly prepared items assault me. They don't know I haven't had a morsel of food for 12 days. I do though. Couple that with the Texas heat, and anyone's strength could be sapped.

Market ends and I pack up and head back to the shop, already weak and exhausted. It's 4 o'clock. I rest and catch my strength for a bit, but have to clean the kitchen from the aftermath of preparing today's items. Which I do. It's now 8 PM and the last bit of nourishment I had was about 10 oz of Mean Green at 11:30. 

Thoughts of every food are wracking my brain. My body was screaming for calories and protein. And I was going to get them. I texted my partner. 

""I am going to eat something. Telling you in case you want to join.""

We meet up at her place. She provides a respite. Convinces me to drink some orange juice she has and then decide. I drink two big glasses. The demons begin to fade. I might still eat, but it isn't a given now. Maybe instead of fajitas, which would surely destroy my bowels and stomach as well as undo all of the good I have built up over the past 12 days, I would still eat but make a better choice.

But my sanity had returned; even briefly. Long enough to stop at a juice bar along the way home to get a large freshly squeezed juice.

Admittedly, I wasn't sated. But I was full and nourished. And that was enough.

I came home and went straight to bed, disappointed in my own weakness and ease to which my old habits would return if allowed. And I slept and woke up this morning thankful that I could still continue on this journey. Thankful for cooler heads and good advice. Hopefully smarter as well.

I was a bit surprised this morning when I looked down at the scale and saw an **increase** in my weight from yesterday. How can this be? I certainly hadn't increased my calories. I still haven't eaten that cheeseburger that haunts my thoughts!

I also knew immediately this would happen. ANd it will happen again and again. A lot of that shock weight you lose right after starting is water weight. Ate some more salt yesterday than usual which resulted in a higher water retention.

More important than that, regardless of cause, I know there will be ups and downs. The only thing that needs to remain consistent is my resolve, and that has remained steady.

So I juiced and drank today as normal, despite an immense amount of temptation. I also feel habits falling away hopefully not to return, or if they do, it is just for a visit.

A juice fast is difficult at present because of social needs (read: I really don't want to explain to everyone at parties why I'm only drinking juice). But I wanted to substitute one meal per day with juice, specifically my dinner.

Breakfast (around 10:00AM): 3 eggs with 2 strips of bacon and seasoned with a variety of tabasco sauces and black pepper; lunch (some time around 2:00PM): egg/salmon salad made with full mayo and maybe some homemade kimchi just to make sure poop burns on its way out; and then dinner (usually no later than 6:00PM): a liter of Mean Green juice.

Make sure that you have at least 2 speeds for your juicer. Some fruits will get blended to all hell and you won't get the juice you need. Is this true?

Hand wash your juicer. But how often?

A blender might be best for fruits. Is this true?

I want to do this right, so I'm doing a lot of research and I'd appreciate any advice you guys could give about how to complete a successful juice fast.

A little background on me:  I started losing weight a year ago [May 2012].  I got my eating habits under control first, and lost about 40# over 3 months that way.  Then I started subbing breakfast and lunch with whole fruit/veggie smoothies that I made with a nutribullet, and lost another 25# or so over 6 weeks that way.  After that, I decided to give Keto a go, and lost another 30# in about 6 weeks of doing that.  Then the holidays hit, and I managed to just eat clean [and pig out only at holiday dinners], and lost another 40# through the season [a fact I'm super proud of].  Since January, I haven't lost or gained any weight, but I've started lifting and working with a trainer the last month or so, and am seeing my body start to tighten up.  I want to detox, and get the ball rolling on my weight loss again, and I think juicing will help with that tremendously, but I want to do it right.  I still have ~140# to go, and the last thing I want is to put myself into starvation mode, or to lose significant weight, only to have it return when I transition out of fasting.  Normally, I eat ~2000 cal/day by having a smoothie and protein bar for breakfast, a spinach and chicken salad for lunch, and tuna or chicken for dinner.  I throw in some yogurt and almonds for snacks if I get hungry in-between-times.

But with that being said, I've noticed that many of the health publications I follow have been very negative toward juice made from fruit and the the supposed benefits it gives. 

If I understand the argument correctly, the fact that you are removing the sugar from the fruit in a liquid form will cause it to be absorbed that much faster, which is a bad thing. It seems that when it comes to fruit, including the pulp gives the benefit of a slower breakdown of the natural sugars. As you can see I'm not being very technical with this, so if someone has a more thorough answer they'd like to throw down here that would be great. 

Anyway based on this information, is it best to juice with mainly vegetables and maybe one small piece of fruit added for flavor? Or is it really best just to eat your apples/kiwi etc. whole?

2. Juicing questions...do you peel kiwi/oranges/lemons/etc? What about pomegranates? What are some random things you have learned to do that helps flavor/taste/consistency? 

3. Do you recommend that I take any supplements during my fast? I'm planning on a 7 day fast to start off, then if I'm up for it I'll continue onto maybe a 30 (stopping and figuring my moods/health along the way.)

I can't really think of any more, but if any other new juicers have other questions feel free to add them on. And if anyone has any tips and recommendations, I'd love to hear them!

2 Carrots



Pretty good, Nice n Sweet


""Cleanse"" Breakfast

2 Kiwi

2 Prunes

2 apples

4 Carrots

2 Spartan Apples

Really nice, the Kiwi oddly enough takes over a lot of the flavor.


Saturday morning OJ
2 servings

6 Oranges

A good trick is to leave just a little peel on one of the oranges really upgrades the orange flavor. 


Breakfast Juice

2.5 servings

4 carrots

2 Apples

2 cups of Grapes

Half a bunch of Kale

Not super bitter, pretty tasty!, but the Kale turned my juice from Orange to Hulk Green.


Veggie-er Breakfast Juice (finally Did some Groceries)

4 Large Carrots

3 Stalks of Celery

1/4 bunch of Spinach

1 Golden Delicous apple

* dash of salt

I love garlic, so I put two cloves. There is a big garlic kick to it, so you could cut that back. Also, the first time I made it I used half an Onion....wow that was over powering.

Tip I think I read somewhere on this subreddit. I stuffed the garlic and onion into the pepper, and surrounded the pepper with the celery stalks. I have a centrifugal juicer with a 3 inch shoot, so it fit very snugly. This allows you to control the speed and pressure much much easier.

One of the things about green juice that people frequently cite is that it is alkaline which is good for you. Adding lemon juice, lime juice, or vinegar is just adding an acid to the juice. 


Acids and alkaline liquids neutralize (to a degree, we're not practicing tritration here) to produce salts and water.

I didn’t do it to detoxify my body, or to “reset” myself into a different lifestyle. I did do it to shock my body because I had a long plateau (3 weeks) on my other diet (which I will be returning to after). I didn’t make any kind of fasting journal so I have no running count of what I juiced and how exactly I felt. However I can give you a rundown of the juices I stuck to as well as general feelings from the days. 



Morning – 1 Grapefruit, half a pear, half a mango


Midday – Classic Mean Green


Evening – If I was still “hungry” at this point I would do some carrot based juice



I started out with almost no knowledge of what juicing was. I didn’t watch Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead until day 4 and that was not the reason for me trying this. My fiancé was on it the first 8 days, and she put up with my bad first trys at juicing. After I got a pattern of some decent drinks it was a lot better. She had to stop on day 8 from doctors orders to have food on her stomach with a new medicine she had to take, however she was in for the long haul. 



Anyway, the only thing that kept me going the first 3-4 days was my enthusiasm for pushing myself to do something I had never done before. I had done a few 3 day water fasts and I knew how crappy it would be the first days anyway. 



By halfway through day 4 I had extraordinary amounts of energy. On day 5 I ran 5 miles, I was going to just do a 5k and then decided I would push it.  I had all this energy ontop of having a fulltime job and being a fulltime grad student at a college 1.5 hours away from me. Normally I’m to beat to push myself out of my normal routine. Also, during this time I bought and moved a hottub.



However, by the night of day 7 I was just not into it anymore. I wasn’t “hungry”, I wasn’t out of energy, I was just not into juicing anymore. I almost quit on day 8 because that’s when my fiancé started eating again, but she made me stick with it because she knew I would be pissed off at myself if I didn’t. 



Here I sit now, midday on day 10, sipping on some mean green. I woke up this morning and I was 21 lbs lighter than I was 10 days ago. My fiancé lost 7 lbs in 8 days. Our main reason for starting this was because of a weight loss competition at the place we work at. I feel I got more out of this experience than I bargained for originally. Also it had the added benefit of basically killing most of my co-wroker motivation/hope for winning this competition.



All that aside, I’m going to water fast tomorrow and then switch back to my regular Keto diet which helped me lose my first 40 lbs. Like I said I did it to shock my body and I feel it worked. I’m expecting a gain of 5-10 lbs when I switch back to solid foods and unlike a lot of juicers I have no desire to keep on a path of raw fruits and veggies. I have ample energy on the keto diet and having a job behind a computer it allows me to snack when I want all day, on foods I enjoy, without worrying about weight gain. However, I would like to thank everyone that contributes to /r/Juicing for all the helpfull info I recieved. I will probably do this a couple times a year from here on out.

(He's a habitual lurker, but may pop in occasionally.)  Our kitchen is so overwhelmed with produce, it looks more like a zoo food prep station than a residential kitchen.

So far, we've been doing okay.  It's our first fast and we're trying our best to take it easy on ourselves as we transition into this new way of eating/being mindful.  We're both grossly overweight and have a plethora each of health problems, predominantly digestive issues.

Spouse is a big coffee drinker, so his caffeine adjustment may be a challenge, but he said this morning he had his breakfast juice on his way to work instead of coffee and by the time he sat at his desk, he was alert and ready to tackle the day.  I'm sure he'll have a few adjustment days, but hopefully this will be a frequent occurence.

I had a migraine going into today, so I wouldn't say I've had as pleasant an experience as him, but I have such frequent chronic migraines that waiting for a day without them to start the fast would be impossible.  My hope is that they begin to lessen in frequency and strength with the fast, if I'm lucky.

I may have drastically overbought produce, but I know our past behavior with life changes is to give up when it gets hard and I'd rather have stuff leftover than have to bother with another annoying trip to the store, if I can help it.  I hope to get more accurate with practice.

We're committed to a 10 day fast with open minds about continuing to 21 or 30 and would consider continuing to 60 if all goes well.

We'd ideally like to lose 100+ pounds each over the long haul, but weight is not our sole or even primary factor for fasting.  Our bodies are just in terrible condition and desperately in need of an overhaul.

It's great to have this community as a resource and support system.  So far, this is no easy task, but we both really want it to work and we're giving it our all.

Then, Wednesday the 27th, the ground fell out from beneath our feet. 

He was offered a new position which he accepted immediately - this means that within the next month, we need to find a new home, pack up our life, move, and I need to quit my current job and find a new one.

On Friday, the 30th, I was contacted by one of the most famous companies in the world, completely out of the blue, asking if Hey, would you be interested in applying for a position with us?

Uh, yes, yes I am.

I am now less than an hour away from my first phone call with the recruiter. I am not very confident in my ability to actually **GET** a job with them, so I am just a bundle of stress and nerves.

In this changing world, one thing has remained constant for the past 9 days - JUICE. I would normally have binged on cupcakes or a burger or something thanks to all this stress, but since my fiance and I are doing this fast together, it's kept me going, and it's kept me focused on what's really important rather than beating myself up for eating a pastry and getting distracted.

I know this post doesn't make a lot of sense (I'M REALLY NERVOUS) but I just want to say thanks to all of you, /r/juicing, for helping me reassert some control in my life, and for just generally being a great little subreddit. 

Have a juicy day y'all!

I feel like working the front knob from tight to loose is like walking a tightrope... slip one way and it's clog city - slip the other way and the juice ends up in the roughage bowl. You have to adjust the knob constantly, like playing an instrument.

I am putting all my stuff through mixed as opposed to soft item, hard item, soft item. I have to chop everything up beforehand so I put it all in one big container. If I have to keep everything separated it will be another pain. 

Some pulp and chunks get into the juice pitcher A lot of drippage misses the pitcher and ends up on the table. Have to lay down towels or find a tray.

The cleanup instructions say to pour water thru the machine but by the time you are done the thing is too clogged up for water to pass thru (even with finely chopped materials). So it takes a lot of work to get that water out. 

Cleaning up is a pain but I'm getting more used to it.

Todays juicing from cutting up stuff to cleanup took about 1 hour and 20 minutes. 

I drank it all (not sure how much since I was sipping it out of the pitcher as I was making it) but could be 1.5-2 pitchers full total.

Joe Cross and Phil Staples excluded, but the public spotlight likely keeps them from ""cheating"" -- at least while it is all popular.

I've been on a keto based diet now since late December and I've dropped 38 pounds.  However, around the middle of last year I did buy one of those great juicers from the movie and I completed a 10 day juice fast.

The issue I had is that I couldn't find my endgame.  As I had the juice, and the hunger pangs subsided, I started to question what I would do after this.  All of the youtube videos and testimonials of the ""30/60 Day Juice Fast"" ended in failure or they just quite posting.  I also found quite a few who had come back and admitted that within a couple of months they were right back where they were prior to the fast.

Things like that were very discouraging, and I myself couldn't seem to find an endgame approach, because I realized I wasn't going to become a raw foodie or a vegan after this diet...I was definitely going back to meat consumption w/ fruits/vegetables and the occasional beer.  After 10 days, I stopped the juice fast and I gained the 20ish pounds i had lost back within a month...just like everyone else.

So, now after doing the low carb thing, it seems that there is one thing very crucial about it.  You literally can't gain weight.  The state of ketosis destroys your hunger (which is part of what helps with the juice fast as well) and your body can't retain fat in your cells because of the lack of glucose production.

Low carb is an endgame that i can eat.  I've done it for 3 months now almost, and there's nothing I miss that I can't work into the diet and stay below 30-40 carbs a day and keep myself in Ketosis.  As it stands, even if I have a beer craving I can knock back 2-3 Michelob Ultras as 2.6 carbs each and not fall out of ketosis and gain.  

I was never a sugar person, but I was a starch &amp; carb person.  I don't really miss carbs &amp; starch.  Bread? Sugar?  Nothing I care about really... It is more the hidden carbs that I have to watch out for, but that is simple conscious behavior.

So I was just wondering if anyone else has tried this.  Start juicing while in Ketosis... Juice mainly Mean Green, which should keep you in Ketosis if you don't drink a gallon at a time...then go back to a keto based diet after the juicing as the end game.

-Spinach, two big handfuls, cleaned

-Apples, 2 medium-large Granny Smiths (the tartness works well here)

-Nutmeg, freshly grated

Wash and chop spinach into 2-4 inch pieces. This way the juicer gets less clogged with the ""strings"" in the spinach.

Juice the spinach. 

Slice apples, remove core, and juice them.

Add nutmeg at the end.

So my questions for the group are:

* Is this normal given the age of the juicer after 6 months of (near) daily use?

* Do I need to sharpen the auger or replace individual parts?

I was on day 58, started having really bad back and stomach pain, went to the ER, was told I had appendicitis and that they needed to take out my appendix. Got it removed with the laproscopic method, which requires less recovery time, but I had to break my fast a little early in the hospital when they were feeding me popsicles for my throat and what not. I am just wondering if anyone else has had this experience from an extended juice fast. I know that the appendix is used as a sort of storehouse for good bacteria, which is distributed to the intestines as needed. I really don't want to believe that juicing caused this, but I am wondering if my intestines didn't require any good bacteria because it was getting all it needed from the juice, so the bacteria in my appendix sat and got infected. That's what my boyfriend and dad think anyway. I am now back to eating very soft, mostly plant based foods, but I still haven't been able to poo or toot, so I am in quite a bit of pain.

How did you avoid over sugary juices? 


How did you count the carbs in the juice? (I've noticed that juicerecipes.com cuts carbs from solid to liquid)

Did you use juice as a meal replacement? Or snack?

I haven't posted in a couple of days, partly because it has been a very busy time. Mostly because I didn't have anything to say. Progress is going well and my resolve continues to be steadfast. But as I write this, the monotony is getting to me a bit. 

We are surrounded by food every day, and everything, EVERYTHING looks really good. A dark part of me wishes the results weren't coming so I could abandon the program and go back. But I squash that knowing I am getting good results and those results will ultimately make me way happier than whatever it is I want to eat at the moment.

Beyond an exercise in health and wellness, this is becoming an exercise in true discipline. In seeing what I am capable of. In seeing whether I will disappoint myself once again.

There isn't any danger really. I will wake up in a few hours and feel completely differently. For once, I will see this through. I really need to remember this feeling and this road if and when the habits and weight start coming back. Because right this moment, the price feels high.

So I am on the plus side of a week solid without chewing a thing. Frankly, the time went very quickly. I am learning a lot about my own resolve and about how my body functions.

Speaking of, I see a lot of talk in this sub fretting about how this isn't working, or not sure if the results are worth the effort.

Let me just share something with you. [Look at this](http://i.imgur.com/IRLYuwo.png).

This is a graph from MFP of my weight for the past 7 days. Notice something? Yep, it is fairly flat. Sure, I lost a bit, but since then, meh. And let me tell you, the 1000-1400 calories a day is what I was eating in an appetizer for one meal a little over a week ago. So, what gives?

In addition to weight, my scale also gives Body Fat Percentage with each weigh in. I am not recording this, but I am noticing the number. So each morning, while I see this flat weight number pop up, I have also noticed my body fat percentage drop. Like 6% so far. I'm not lifting so I am not making up for it in muscle, so what the hell is going on?

Without any research, or expertise in physiology, anatomy, or nutritional science, this is the conclusion I have come to. Prior to starting this juice journey, I drank soda, Diet Coke to be specific, almost exclusively. I also ate salt and fat and a lot of it in every meal. I think prior to starting juicing, I was chronically dehydrated. I started juicing and drinking water exclusively. The body initially reacts to the drastic cut in calories by dropping weight like a mother fucker. Then it settles down and adjusts to the new thing I am making it do. All the while refreshing my dehydrated body with all this new moisture. Calories cut = lower fat percentage. More much needed water = water retention and not a sharp drop in weight. This is pure conjecture on my part by the way.

But here is the bottom line. I am in it for the long haul. Whatever the scale says this week or next is irrelevant. Here is real talk. I haven't had meat, dairy, processed sugar or gluten in over a week. The big bunch of vegetables and fruit I am having with each glass is WAY better for me that that cheeseburger and onion rings I would be hovered over instead. My body and the scale will figure things out eventually. I trust that. Because I know what I am eating every day is good for me and if full of the things I have been neglecting for years. So I am not down a pants size in a week. Vegetables and fruit aren't a gimmick. If I talk to you in a month and things aren't different, I will be discouraged, of course. I will also be very confused. But will I feel better, have more energy, etc? Of course I will. And this really is about health not a waist size.

So for those of you who wonder whether this regime is worth it, I ask you, what is your alternative? What is your normal? I have a feeling you are missing the big picture because you are too focused on the frame.

Now I am finally acting on my desire and beginning my research.  The world of juicing is a vast one, and I am a bit overwhelmed, and looking for some advice from those with experience.

From the bit of reading I have done, I wonder first what type of juicer will best suit my wants/needs.

For the past ~two years I have been the most unhealthy I have ever been in my life; and I'm looking to finish that chapter.

I enjoy leafy greens/vegetables.  I try to incorporate them into my diet whenever I can.  Which lately, is not often enough.  (arugula, spinach, asparagus, green beans[?], lettuce, kale, broccoli, etc.)

I have always wanted to base my juices around more greens than anything - particularly wheatgrass.  I have never actually had wheatgrass before though; but from what I've read, there are not many juicers that are towards the more affordable end of the spectrum that can handle wheatgrass and other thicker leafy greens.

Obviously I would enjoy juicing fruits towards the morning for a breakfast.

So basically long story short - I'm looking for some advice on what kind of juicer I can do ""everything"" with, that's not in the $400+ price range, if such a thing exists?",,False,self,t5_2s602,False,,,True,t3_1aazvi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/1aazvi/rjuicing_i_come_to_you_looking_for_advice/,

I recently watched a documentary on Netflix called ""Hungry for Change"" and they spoke a bit on juicing.  They mentioned how juicing will give you more energy.

I'm not really interested in replacing meals with juicing but more so just adding it in to my daily mix.  Considering the cost I am only interested in 1 glass a day.  Will doing this increase my energy levels?

I'll also add that I do not consume any caffeine.  Which seems to be where everyone else gets their energy.

I've done juice fasting before and I've lost 20 lbs.  Overall, I'm down from 274 to 217 today.  Today, I start the next phase to go down to 180.

But here are some questions I can't seem to get straight answers on...

Almond or Rice Milk:  Is this OK or not?  Fresh n Easy sells organic, unsweetened Almond Milk.  I would NOT use this in place of juice.  I do drink 96 oz of juice a day.  But I thought it might be nice to have 16 oz of Almond Milk a day.

Protein:  I'm already Vegan, so Whey or other animal proteins are already out.  But what about Rice or Soy protein?  I in particular like to make a custom vegan mix at truenutrition.com.  No GMO's or strange chemicals.  The reason I asked is because last time I juiced I just couldn't work out all that much, and definitely could not weight lift.  I believe some protein would help.  Thinking about 75g per day.

Anyways, wish me luck.  Your opinions are appreciated.  I love to research, so if you have a link to share that would be doubly great!

2.  Apparently I bought a centrifugal juicer (just bought based on price and reviews), but a masticating juicer yields more juice per fruit and loses less nutrients.  Have I really put myself at that much of a disadvantage with the juicer I bought?

3.  I know juicing is still cheaper than eating out, and I'm not looking to replace all meals with juice, but, really, how expensive does it get?  If you had to 'guestimate', how much does a typical a) fruit based juice and b) vegetable based juice cost to make per serving?  And what's a realistic serving?

I used to be a powerlifter, but life got in the way. I'm getting back into the heavy lifting game (starting 5/3/1 in January after I make sure I have my 1RMs right) but I want to recomp first and just lift more for my sport (soccer and rock climbing) than for numbers.

Since I'm done with finals I figured I'd push myself to the limit diet/exercise wise and do doubles of P90X, and start my juice fast! I've done two juice fasts before; three days and five days respectively but this is my first week long. I might even push it out to the beginning of term if I feel that I can keep it up (and assuming my family doesn't give me any shit for not eating their Christmas food.)

First batch:

* 4 Zucchini
* 2 Beets
* 3 Apples
* 10 Stocks of Celery
* 10 Carrots
* 4 Cucumbers
* 1oz Ginger Root
* 2 Bell Peppers
* 8oz Plum Juice
* 5oz Lemon Juice
* 36g Cytosport Vanilla Whey Protein

That made about 3/4 of a gallon, so I mixed in some water to top it off. My previous fasts I have mixed 50/50 water and juice and drink it over the course of the day.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/vLLkc#0) is everything chopped and ready to go, and the result.

I do have a question though, I track my food intake through myfitnesspal and with all of that it totaled: 1,545 cals, 277g carbs, 13g fat, 116g protein, and 65g of fiber. I understand the everything except for the carbohydrate level, that kind of threw me for a loop.

As I mentioned last week 269 is the lowest I've been in at least three years and I'm pretty definitively below that now. It's pretty awesome to have gone back in time a bit. 260 is the lowest I've been in at least five years and I may get there in the next week or two.

It's really nice to be breaking new ground rather than simply working through the weight that I've relatively recently gained, lost, gained and finally lost again. A friend of mine whom I try to see once a month or so has never known me to be this light. In the next few weeks when I get below 260 then the number of people who have never known me to be this small (or relatively small anyway) will increase pretty steadily. Definitely a good feeling. Also, 255 is halfway to onederland and seems unlikely but possible that I'll reach it before this 60 day juice fast is up. It's only 11 pounds and I have 18 days left.

I am 29 and will be 30 in December. I am 6'4"". I have been doing the Rippetoes work out for 3 months now. I have put on some muscle and lost some fat but I am the same weight. I had a normal BM yesterday and this morning. I have been drinking little over 20oz three times a day at my normal eating times. I have not been hungry and did have a slight headache a few times yesterday. All day yesterday and this morning I feel super energetic. I have not had the urge to eat or any depression that some describe. I did go to bed early yesterday but had went bed late the prior night so don't think it was from the juicing. I have a Omega J8004 juicer.

**Day 2 (10/16/12):** This morning I was 330.0. Today I had little less energy than yesterday but still above average. I had a slight headache but almost unnoticeable. Scale shows 327.4 this evening at 8pm. I drank so much water today, I couldn't stop myself. Feeling pretty tired this evening, I have a theory its my natural rhythm that is usually masked by sugar and caffeine. My wife was doing this with me but she had very low energy yesterday and today, so she just ate some eggs. She is going to juice for two meals a day and have a sensible meal for dinner. She has so little to lose anyways.

**Day 3 (10/17/12):** Weighted in at 326.8 this morning. Drinking my lunch right now. Blended in half a avocado and half a banana yesterday for dinner and today for lunch. Didn't realize these items didn't juice until after I purchased them, don't want them to go to waste. I work our at 6pm Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Rippetoes. Monday I had the most energy I had ever had during a workout. I will report today if I feel the same. I am having not having hunger issues and no headache today either. 4pm now, feeling hungry and have a urge for food, think its stress related, I think I eat for comfort....going to hold out until after my workout. Ended up having my juice dinner prior to workout. Workout energy is at levels prior to juice fast. 8:55PM scale in showing 325.2. In the past I made myself go to bed by 10pm. I am getting pretty tired by 9pm now, but yesterday and today I did/will go to bed at 10pm, usually asleep in minutes, went to sleep around 10:30pm.

**Day 4 (10/18/12):** 322.2 this morning, I did not want to wake up. Off to make the juice. Got really tired this evening weighed in at 320.0 before bed.

**Day 5 (10/19/12):** 320.0 this morning. I was so hot last night, usually have a/c at 74 took it down to 70, just couldn't cool off. Weighed 320.0 around 9pm. Went to a comedy show, late night, got home after 1 am, stuck to my juice fast, no alcohol, weighted 321.0 before I went to bed.

**Day 6 (10/20/12):** 319.0 this morning, going surf fishing this morning, have a party later, not use to not being able to consume alcohol, off to make the juice. Only slept 4 hours last night, didn't drink my juice for dinner and went to bed at 8pm. Weighed 317.2 before bed.

**Day 7 (10/21/12):** 315.6 this morning, surprisingly I am not hungry though I missed dinner last night and haven't eaten breakfast yet. I slept almost 12 hours last night because the previous night I only slept 4. 9:50pm 317.4, drank so much water today. Went to wife's nephew's birthday party, all kinds of good foods I did not touch. One week done ready for another.

**Day 15 (10/29/12):** 308.0 this morning.

**Day 16 (10/30/12):** 306.6 this morning.

**Day 17 (10/31/12):** 306.6 this morning, don't know why I have these days that I don't loose anything. Today at noon would be the halfway point of my initial 33 day fast, woohoo. Hoping I can get down to 290 by the end of 33 days.

**Day 18 (11/1/12):** 304.0 this morning. Did not drink my juice this morning and have been doing manual labor from 7:30am to 10am, bad idea, felt like I was going to pass out. Just drank my breakfast juice at 10:30am, will let it set in, so I don't pass out in the shower, then drink my lunch after my shower. I have skipped juice meals before but never did manual labor afterward, be warned.

**Day 19 (11/2/12):** 303.8 this morning. Having all four wisdom teeth pulled today under light sedation. Well had my wisdom teeth pulled, almost passed out before they knocked me out. I think I need a surplus of calories for the healing process. I switched back to conventional food/diet after the surgery. I will resume fasting if I feel I am far enough along in the healing on Monday.

**Day 01 (11/12/12):** 317.4 this morning. Resumed fasting. I tried to go back to fasting two times after my surgery and my pain increased and my medicine was making me ill. I figured I would risk losing my gains rather than being ill longer. I was really bad, being in pain and food soothes me overall, I ate whatever I wanted at any quantity....lots of ice cream.

I've been overweight since I was a kid. My parents just had no concept about healthy eating and as a result I remember in high school my mom would order a pizza just for me. 

Now im 29 and living on my own. I make 46k a year and guess what, im broke all the time. I don't spend money on cable, phones, hobbies, saving etc. I order pizza and/or grubhub 1-2 times a day. On top of that, im addicted to energy drinks and cigarettes. 

**questions**
1) Given the above information, does anyone have specific advice for me to break these bad habits?

2) I have a Vitamix and have done raw vegan for 2 weeks. Is there any benefit to juicing over blending from a weight loss perspective? I think blending just has the fiber and juicing just doesnt.

3) What exactly is the fat, sick and nearly dead diet? Like how much juice per day and is there specific stuff I should juice?

Im not living. Im killing myself and this year its hit me hard leading to suicidal depression and if not suicidal, just regular depression. I find myself lurking all over facebook watching my old friends live their lives in complete envy of their happiness. Its so sad. so this is me reaching out.

**update**
thanks everyone for the support. I got fruits and kale for my blender so I can start going raw(ish) again(and have good stuff in my fridge) and did not have energy drinks today, although I darted directly for them when I walked into the store. I picked up water instead. I dont have a juicer and im super broke, so that will have to wait. 

Plan of action
#1 0 pizza/fastfood/delivery 
#2 0 sweetened drinks/sodas
#3 start blending again and stick to it
#4 get a Juicer
#5 Get an e-cig and/or nicorette

I think it's the cucumber that's making it horrible for me. I have never been a fan of cucumber. Is there any substitute? The breakfast juice I had was great, but it was all fruits. Do I have to just man up, or does anyone have a good recipe with vegetables that doesn't include cucumbers.

I want to thank everyone for the suggestions. Last night was the hardest thing I've had to do in my life. I was so hungry, the kids were asleep, so I couldn't fire up the juicer. So I did the next best thing, drank a couple glasses of water, and went to bed myself. I had to make a run to the store before I laid down to get some things, and I drove past a 24 hour McDonalds. I didn't stop! I kept on driving. And I feel amazing for it this morning. Knowing that I made it through that feeling has given me new hope.

I understand a juicer with fresh juices and vegetables would have been optimal, but nonetheless I believe Naked will do the trick. So, my questions are

1) After lifting and cardio sessions, is it okay to drink a whey protein supplement? 

2) Is it okay to even be lifting while on the juice fast? I feel fine other than the decrease strength, so I've been doing lower weight and more reps.

3) I am using a pre-workout (muscle pharm assault) is that okay to drink before workouts as a energy boost?

There is a 3-6 pound weight difference between your body on a juice fast and your body while eating that has nothing to do with fat or muscle loss.

Firstly, if you start a fast on Monday and weigh yourself, you are weighing food from sunday and possibly saturday that is in your system and will not be there in a few days, and will not be replaced.  Your 'normal' weight includes a throughput of food.

Secondly, salt.  Wrestlers know this very well.   Salt intake=water retention.  If you kept eating the same foods but without any salt you could easily lose 2 pounds.  Presumably you are not salting your mean greens. This is why salt increases blood pressure, your body tries to maintain an even salt % in your bloodstream.  When you add salt, it needs to add water.  It is possible to die from drinking several gallons of water very quickly because you can disrupt these blood salt levels.

Thirdly, other science.  Im sure there are other examples and I know this is super vague but something about your liver storing glucose as glycogen.  It takes water to store it.  Similar thing about sugar in your bloodstream.  On a fast, there will be less spare sugar floating around.

So keep in mind: when you lose 11 pounds during your first week fasting and gain 6 on your first week eating, these numbers do not represent calorie deficits of 11*3500 and surpluses of 6*3500, respectively.  

Don't beat yourself up over weight gain when you end your fast, and if you have a target weight in mind you will need to overshoot it while fasting.",,False,self,t5_2s602,False,,,True,t3_tz7w0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/tz7w0/interpreting_weight_loss_data_from_juicing/,

I have been lurking here for about 2 weeks and getting some great information from you all.  I am ready to being my fast but I have some questions.

I am not new to juicing but new to fasting. I have been replacing a meal a day with a juice and I would like to replace all my meals to help me lose some weight. 

I do fine with a thin juice in the mornings however, for lunch and dinner I need something that will stick to my ribs.  This is when I use my Vitamix and make myself a nice thick drink with fruits and veggies.  My issue is that I am not sure with how many oz I should drink when I begin? 
Would it be okay to juice more  than 3 times day? 
Is there a major difference in the juices that come from a juicer and vitamix? 
Also is it okay to have an almond smoothie (I make my own almond milk) during the fast?

I'm on the fast because I watched ""Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead"" and Phil's story (425+ trucker loses 200+ lbs juicing) really resonated with me because he was about the same size I was at the start. In the documentary it's chronicled that he lost 90 lbs in the 60 days. While I was hoping for those results, I didn't expect them, given the usual ""results are atypical, yours may vary.""

In the 11 days I've been on the fast I've discarded roughly 25 pounds. I'm not getting too hungry, if I do I just drink some water. I've been drinking 4 - 24 oz juices a day (sometimes a 5th fruit/cucumber/celery if I'm feeling it). I also supplement fiber every other day to keep the pipes working.

My juices generally consist of:

* Bunch of kale
* 1 cucumber
* 1 small lemon
* 2 granny smith apples
* 3 stalks of celery
* 1 carrot
* 1 thumb sized chunk of ginger
* sometimes I'll throw in a few grapes or strawberries, especially with the first juice of the day

Question: I guess my question is wondering if this is normal or should I be worried? I understand since I'm larger I'll likely have faster loss initially, but was wondering if anybody else has experienced a quick loss like this?

Any other tips/advice would be appreciated.

I was in no way starved), but towards the end of day 6, Just the thought of ingesting more juice made me want to barf up all my days intake. On day 7, I started eating solid, raw produce again and my nausea went away completely. Only now, after a few days off from juicing can I stand the smell of juice again.


I guess my question is did anyone else experience this? Could it have been I just not ingesting enough or too much of a specific produce? I'm ready to give it another go, but I want to make sure it doesn't happen again.

It was ok, but my wife and I used it a lot - and so it started to break. The knob to turn it off and on was getting stuck, and it was very stained all over. 

It served us well for the price. The main complaint that I had was that the pulp was very wet, it took a lot of stuff to get a decent yield, it made a LOT of foam, and it was very loud.

So we decided to buy a [Kuvings Silent Juicer](http://www.amazon.com/Kuvings-Silent-Juicer-Upright-Masticating/dp/B004ZLCBES) - just like the one in the link.

I had done a lot of research, and it came down to the Kuvings and the Omega. I noticed that Omega has a BIG marketing campaign here in the US. They would even have paid endorsers put up YouTube videos in an attempt to look like they were independent reviews. Kuvings is out of Korea, and they have horrible English on their sites, but it looked like a very solid juicer.

Well, now that I've used it, I can say. I LOVE IT. It's fantastic. I get a TON more juice, it's VERY quiet, NO FOAM, and the pulp is DRY!!

I am super stoked about it. I honestly think between the Kuvings and Omega you can't go wrong. It's worth the investment for either. The third brand out there is Hurom, and really all 3 of these juicers are basically the same damn thing when it comes down to it. The only thing I didn't like about the Hurom was that the warranty wasn't a 10 year warranty like the Kuvings and the Omega.

So then it comes down to price.
The Omega 330HD is the comparable juicer, as the ""upgrades"" you get are what the base model of the Hurom and Kuvings are. 

So to me, the Kuvings had the best price, and was the same as the Omega 330HD and the Huron HU-100. 

I feel bad that Kuvings doesn't get as much attention as the Omega brand does in the US. I'm a fan of the juicer.

But day four... day four I entered my own personal hell. My stomach was like a gaping maw, growling and gnashing nearly every waking moment.

I only feel hungry at ""feeding times"" and my cravings are cut in half.

Third and last, I haven't seem to have been experiencing any of the ""pain"", or ""suffering"", that seems to be normal within the first few days, I am of course hungry as before I decided to start juicing my diet consisted solely on MANY Hamburgers and Pizzas, and I do crave it, but I haven't gotten headaches or have had any intense bowel movements yet.

So I figured what better time to do a complete reboot including giving up alcohol during this as well. So 11 days in and I feel great. I really do. I am sitting here sweating because I have just come in from a 3 mile run. I've been doing an hour of exercise every day.

One thing though: I have only done 2 days where I only had juice. The rest of the days I have eaten at least one thing. It differs as to what these were. Some days it was a oven baked chicken thigh covered in chili flakes. Some days it was a small handful of almonds. Some days it was 3 pieces of bacon and half a homemade almond butter sandwich. With giving up smoking, alcohol and food all in one go, it was simply too jarring. So I gave myself one thing a day to look forward to. 

Does anyone think this has voided the benefit of the juice fast? I don't, but I know nothing about these things.

I've been juicing 3 - 4 times a day. Mostly fruit juice for breakfast and then mostly veggie juices for the rest of the day. I've been using the [Omega J8004](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001RLYOEE/ref=pe_175190_21431760_cs_sce_dp_1) masticating juicer, which freaking rocks. Can't say enough good things about this juicer. It makes crazy good almond butter too. 

Summary: I've lost 7lbs in 11 days. Sure it's mostly water weight, no doubt, whatever that is. But I **feel like I have lost 7lbs** and that is worth it to me. I feel so much better than I did as a smoker just 3 short weeks ago I can't tell you. A lot of that has had to do with soaking myself in nutrients with these healthy juices I've been drinking.

So thanks Juiceit! You have helped me start a new period in my life. Tough Mudder next year!

What I wasn't prepared for was feeling extremely nauseous. I didn't eat for several hours after waking, just drank some water. I finally made a juice I knew I liked a lot and I hoped would help my tummy- just apples, beets, carrots, a lemon, and a good chunk of ginger. I drank a few sips and was startled to find that I was thoroughly disgusted by it. The weird thing is still liked the way it tasted, but mentally I was just grossed out for some reason. I couldn't drink the rest. I decided to go an alternate route and make a broth out of some juice pulp I'd frozen- carrots, spinach, tomatoes, cucumber, parsley, and celery, threw in some herbs...at first it smelled good but after a while as I let it simmer it made me want to vomit. 

Since then I've made a couple juices I've previously liked, and can only get a few sips down before feeling grossed out and sick.

BLARGH. I don't know what to do. I still like the taste of juices, but for some reason just feel sickened by the thought of them.

I have done dishes and laundry at 6 am. I have slept like a baby, run after my four year old for a straight hour at the park, taken my home care patient for three hour walks, gone on a brutal seven hour hike through a national park and loved every damn minute of it.

First off, a bit about myself. Currently, I am 20 years off, waiting to go to college hopefully next summer, and weigh 225 lbs. I was at an average of 173 lbs throughout my High School years, because I always took advantage of my school's Cardio Room. Unfortunately, on July 9th 2011, I was T-boned by a drunk driver coming home from my best friend's, and was hospitalized. The doctor told me that I was lucky, and that he were surprised that I was that I was not paralyzed from the accident (My back was screwed up, my Left leg, and both of my arms were also broken from the accident.)

Unfortunately, I was told by the doctor, that because of me being considered a Liability now, I have no hope of ever being employed for any kind of Physical Labor, so I have to hope that I can do some thing with Coding Games once I start / get out of college. I also cannot bike, run, or do much nowadays, other than go on Walks with my dogs, or Swim during the summer.

Since I cannot apply any where for work now, I sit at home and assist my mom with her Ebay business, and sell Clothes she never plans on listing. It's not much compared to what I could get working in Stores, or Fast food or whatever, but it at least gives me money. Of course, this also means that I sit around the house a lot, with only being able to Walk for at least an hour each day.

Since I can't do much, I was told by a friend that I should give Juicing a try, because it is a good way to cleanse the body, and helps shed a lot of weight fast.

1. What I am wondering, is I have a Vitamix Blender at home. Unfortunately, I do not own a Juicer, and cannot get one at the moment, since Financials for us is tight (We're between Low and Mid Class, but closer to Low Class.) Is it possible for me to do Juicing with a Blender? I was told that it's best to have a Juicer, because then you're avoiding getting the Fiber or some thing from the skin of the Vegetables / Fruit (The Pulp or whatever,) but is it really necessary to have those removed?

2. I am not sure what recipes would work. I am going into this completely blind. Might try experimenting with some combinations, and see what happens. Can any one recommend me some pretty good recipes, that not only gives me my daily supplements, but also helps a lot with losing weight?

I appreciate any and all help I could get from you guys about it. I am hoping that I can still Juice without a Juicer VIA a Blender.

So I have been juicing quite successfully for about 11 days (as of 4/23) and I have lost 22 pounds. I am happy with the progress and I have seen nothing but positive results thus far.

I gave up everything cold turkey. No coffee no sugars, no snacks, no nothing. Just juice.

I had been eating seasoned steak, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro with black beans for lunch daily for 30 days. Dinner was normally chicken thigh or breast, sometimes soup but rarely, and breakfast was always the worst - a bagel with butter and a large coffee from Dunkin.

I find myself wondering when the juicing is done - why not go with what seems like a traditional keto diet? It certainly seems more satisfying to taste buds. Juicing is very difficult and I yearn for some steak or sausage or chicken quite badly.

When I drink a 16oz juice of any kind I feel VERY full. Every time. The cravings are addiction and nothing more I think. That said - wouldn't it be possible to combine small portions with 16oz of juice? i.e. a chicken breast or one skillet eggs or some steak tips?

I am very much in ketosis - I tested today and it was the darkets color on the strip - admittedly I am probably not drinking enough water - the juice plus maybe 100oz a day so about 3/4th of a gallon. I am horrible about water but I am trying to improve that and I have gotten better.

1. There was much more pulp in the juice than I was expecting with my first recipe, which was ""mean green"". Is this normal or am I doing something wrong?

2. I really want to juice immediately following my morning workout, so is it unheard of to mix whey protein powder into the drink? Does anyone know of any unflavored powder which they can recommend?

3. Full on fasting isn't an option for me, as I can't be home to juice except early mornings and late nights, as well as the fact that veggies can be expensive when eaten for every meal of the day. That is, at least down in California where I live. What would be a good lunch option to avoid ruining the detox effect and ultimately healthier lifestyle which I'm striving for?

Day 4: I started going to the gym. Its been a couple years since I've gone with any regularity. I am sticking with a simple daily routine. Back/Biceps, Chest/Triceps, Legs/Shoulders. Each set is rotated daily and I take 1 day off a week. Also Abs everyday except day off. I don't claim this is the best routine but it's what I'm starting with.
Day 5: I woke up feeling awful and it only got worse throughout the day. I I went to the gym in the afternoon and felt ok for awhile  after. But the late evening and bed time were AWFUL. I was really quezy and I couldn't sleep for some time.
Day 6: Woke up feeling great! My sickness passed in the night and I slept fine after that. Plan on gym this afternoon! So far I have lost 8lbs.

I got really busy in the middle of the day and had to go a few hours without a juice. Needless to say, by the time the sun went down I was starving, and driving by all of the restaurants on the way home didn't help the issue. I decided I needed to mix things up and picked up the closest fruit/veggies and throw them in the juicer.

I made an orange juice from 4 clementines. Probably some of the best I've had in my life. Then I threw a banana in expecting the worst...and got the worst haha. In case you were wondering, there isn't much/any juice in a banana. Next was a mango which went down nicely.

Decided to get a little adventurous and threw aloe vera leaves and an apple in. Turned out to be pretty disgusting but I was curious since I've seen big jugs full of the stuff.

Made some mean green for dinner and I'm feeling back to normal. I think if I had a mid day juice I wouldn't have struggled as much his evening so I guess overall I'm feeling a little better than yesterday.

Halfway home. Excited for it to be over but worried I haven't wrapped my head around my post fast strategy. All I wanted to do tonight was chow down on a burger but I know that if I go straight for it after the fast, I'm going to end up right back where I started. Hoping for a strong week.

1357506448.0,6,self.Juicing,162u4r,Some thoughts on my experience,6,0,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Juicing/comments/162u4r/some_thoughts_on_my_experience/,"I'm starting my second juice fast.  I originally did my first one back during spring break of 2012 and I made it 16 days before I gave up on it.  I made it through a very very very tempting Easter Sunday family get together and a couple more days until I reached my first midterm and the stress of school broke my will and I returned to eating.  I was feeling amazing though by that point.  Though I still craved food I was feeling great energy wise.  I was starting to run again and I was a whirlwind around the house, the kitchen has never been cleaner.  
My wife isn't that supportive of my choice to juice.  She is worried about the costs of the veggies, and she has issue with the radical nature of juicing.  A lot of diets are radical (Atkins for example) where you have to radically change what you eat and they don't tend to last.  
I did not do well after my last juice fast.  I was stressed at school and I gained all the weight back pretty quickly and I've continued putting the weight on for the rest of the year.  Weighing myself on the first I was 9lbs lighter than my heavies of all time.  I had gained almost forty pounds since the end of my fast in about 9 months.  
So why am I going back to fasting?  There are several things I like about the juice fasting.  The rapid weight loss isn't the only benefit.  I felt great after the first 6 days.  2-4 were the worst, 5 was a good day, 6 was agonizing with terrible cravings, and then 7 on was great.  After 10 I was feeling great, mentally and physically I felt amazing.   
My biggest problem is that I didn't give myself any rules for after the diet.  I had plans, but I never put them in place and wasn't organized.  
Another movie has inspired me to make some changes too.  Forks over Knives was a bit eye opening and inspiring and I'm actually contemplating going vegan.  This is the most unlikely thing ever thought of, from a meat loving man, who includes meat and cheese as the greatest things ever.  
I don't think I'm going to go full vegan but I want most days to follow the whole foods vegan lifestyle and I have a suspicion that when I realize how the fatty processed meats make me feel that I start staying away from them more and more, even though I love them so!
I'm breaking some rules with this fast too.  I'm allowing myself a cup of coffee in the morning.  I might drop it after a couple days but at least for the last two days it has helped.  
I think it is important to remember that we aren't perfect.  If you don't stay perfect in your fast that doesn't mean you should quit it.  I took a small nibble here or there the first couple of days when prepping food for the family or cleaning up in the kitchen after meals.  Not much but it has smoothed out the introduction phase.  Except for the coffee the last two days (now day 5) have been really really good.  
Another thing I'm doing that works for me is using store bought orange juice.  I tend to not follow typical recipes.  When I'm shopping for veggies I'm going for what is going to give me the most bang for my buck.  Cucumber, beets, celery, apples, carrots, spinach, pears, ginger, and zuccini are most of the staples.  Much heavier on the green and colored veggies than fruit.  I have found that citrus is a great way to make the juice more palatable.  Yet taking the time to peel and prep citrus can take longer.  So I make a large batch of the mostly pure healthy veggie juice and then I can add orange juice to taste.  I find this saves me time and makes it easier to prep something that I actually want to drink.  Sometimes I go as much as 50/50 but sometimes much less.  I can tailor it to how I'm feeling.  I make enough of the veggies to last a full day and sometimes if I'm making it around lunch one day I can stretch a batch through dinner time the next day.  
One tip I would suggest is having the juicer by the sink.  I fill my sink up about half way and add a small amount of distilled vinegar.  I then load my veggies into the sink and let them soak.  I pull them out and peel the cucumbers or prep as necessary and put them in the juicer.  This is the best way that I've found to get my veggies clean.  
Obviously these ideas are not for everyone, and really you should find what works best for you, but as a repeater these are the things that work for me.  
I also am a runner though my poor food habits in the past have out weighed the benefits from my running.  If you like to run I would keep it very light at the least for the first 10-14 days.  For me that is about 2 miles or 20-30 minutes of exercise.  Beyond that I'm overly depleting my energy levels and only driving up my hunger cravings.   
So I hope this helps someone out there or maybe this just becomes a little bit of journaling for myself.  Either way I hope to juice for at least another 2 weeks and then really transition into a healthy eating pattern.  Even Joe in the movie talked about how he had done it in the past and then fallen back and it wasn't until his documented 60 days that he finally was able to keep on track and afterwards he ate healthy and reaped the rewards.  Good luck everyone!

I've been this way since I was a child, but my family always assumed I was the standard picky eater and would outgrow it. As an example I didn't eat my first hamburger until I was 20, and even then I had to start with small amounts in hamburger helper, then into tacos, and finally small thin patties, and even now I can't eat a steak or any ""solid"" or non-ground beef. My diet as it stands right now is hamburger and ground beef, hard salamis (salami, pepperoni, etc.), cheeses and milk, tomato based condiments and sauces, breads, nearly all fruits, and sugary crap. That is really just about it. Absolutely no vegitables, and barely any meats and no seafood. It boils down to what I jokingly call the ""3 Ps"": pizza, pasta, and pancakes.

And, no, I'm not sure how I have survived 30 years on such limited fare.

However, there is an upside to all of this. I can drink nearly anything. Fruit juices, vegetable juices. They are all good. What I am asking for though is what is a good ""one a day"" blend that I can make to get in my servings of fruits, vegetables, and vitamins to make up for the severe deficit my body has? I got a juicer for christmas, so I really just need to know what to toss in it and I'll be golden.
As far as health goes, I'm really not to bad off. I'm overweight, obviously, because of my high carb diet, but not grossly so, I walk regularly, and maintain a healthy sex life. I (until recently) had a very physical job moving furniture all day every day.

I would love to substitute in a smoothie or gallon of juice a day to get in what I need. The will-power is there, but the knowledge isn't. And before you ask, no, I cannot go to a dietitian, as I do not have health care or a job, so money is an issue right now, but it is something that I will look into once I am back in the game.

Thanks, all.

I figure this will give me some place to be accountable, and allow me to track results to stay motivated.

Just weighed myself this morning and there's a **3.8LB difference** already.

Here's what I had the first day:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Morning:** ""Brain Booster"" - 1 broccoli shoot and floret (I used a whole head, though), 1 cucumber, 1 lemon, 1/2 carrot

**Taste:** Will take some getting used to...lol

**Lunch:** ""Liver Detox"" - 3 apples, 1/2 beet

**Taste:** Really, really good. Almost just like apple juice, and the beet mixed in gives it a really bright pink color (I mention this because the first recipe wasn't quite as visually appealing).

**Evening:** ""Parsley Pump Up"" - 1 cup parsley, 1/2 apple (I think I forgot and used a whole), 2 carrots, 3 celery stalks

**Taste:** I marked down as ""tolerable"".

So, there you have it. Hopefully that'll give some extra recipe ideas, and a dash of motivation.

How are you doing wherever you're at in your juicing?

Edit: Day 2 Update
--------------------------
**Morning:** ""Mega Greenman"" - 2 carrots, 1 broccoli floret/shoot, 2 collard green leaves, 1 ginger knuckle, 2 handfuls of spinach, 1/4 beet, lemon (peeled)

***Taste:*** This one was really rough to get down, but ""chasing"" with water not only helped get it down...it also meant I felt more full after I was done.

**Lunch**: ""Hot Stuff"" - 1 jalapeno, 1 cucumber, 1/2 red bell pepper, 1/2 beet
a
**Taste**: Semi-tolerable. I also wrote ""drink before juice separates"" as a side note, because the beet and pepper juice had settled at the bottom, which made the last bit harder to drink.

**Dinner**: ""Nite Nite"" - 2 bok choy, 1 cucumber, 2 handfuls spinach, 1 lemon
**Taste**: Tolerable

Going into day 3, I've noticed I'm able to fall asleep easier and wake up more rested, and generally have more energy through the day. 

**Weight loss (total) going into day 3:** 6.2Lbs

I am losing about 1-2 LBs every 1-2 weeks. But now i feel I am paying $40 a month just to get weighed and have access to their food cause I don't really follow the point system (which is the whole point of weight watchers lol) I was thinking about starting a 60-day juice fast. I do have some questions I am unable to find answers online...

-With the fast do you have 1 juice for each meal? Breakfast-Dinner

-Is it really expensive?

-What do you do on day 61, go back to just a healthy diet and never juice again or do 60 days on the fast and 60 days off?

-Is it ok to give yourself a ""cheat day"" fast for Mon-Sat then go crazy on sunday?

- And lastly my current exercise plain since i started weight watchers is walk 20-25 Min up and down a hill right next to my house about 4-5 days a week. I have not really been walking for the past 3 weeks due to it being 29999 degrees outside where I live planning on starting again in about a week or so. Is this a good plain to stick to while on the fast I might rejoin the GYM next to my house not sure yet.

I am slightly curious as to what can ""reset"" those stages and put you back on step 1. Mainly concerned if a spoon of raw, organic honey a day, or if a whey protein shake or 2 a day would ""reset"" a fast....... Any info would be great!   Also I noticed a previous post on intense food dreams that was over 6mo old so I couldn't reply in it. But on day 5 now of just juice, and the past 2 nights have been some wicked pizza gorging dreams. Waking up in relief that it wasn't real.

Before my birthday a few weeks ago, I went on a ten day juice fast. Loved it. However, after my birthday festivities and lack of funds, I've just now been able to start back up. Between this new realm of being 21 and moving to a new place, I haven't been able to eat the best, so I gained everything back. 

Speaking of weight, I plan to not weigh myself at all during my next juice fast. The scale has really become my enemy. I used to be all for weighing everyday for encouragement, but I started dreading the scale and seriously became scared of it. It started to rule my emotions and made me unhappy when I didn't see what I wanted to see. I'd honestly call it an addiction, and I'm trying to get rid of it. I just want my mind to realize when my body is healthy. Not some number. 

Today is day 1 again. The cravings are awful because I didn't really prep any. I ate pizza yesterday and had juice today. I'm determined to get through this, and your support and words of wisdom are greatly appreciated.
