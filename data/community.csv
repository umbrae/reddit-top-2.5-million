I'd gotten other small jokes and similar word fragments into earlier episodes, but #208 was my first episode, and this was the first line, and I remember it went all the way from my writer's draft to set basically unchanged. Through rewrites I watched it bob along, past Harmon's mighty hammer, right on through to the table read and into the sides that were given to the actors on the first day of filming. It was like when you and your friends would race leaves down the river--if you grew up in Michigan and did that sort of thing.

We filmed the bottle episode in chronological order so this was the first line that we shot and I remember sitting at the monitors at 7am on the first day thinking, ""If they call action and no one runs in here screaming 'stop the TV-equivalent of presses,' then I will have written a line that will appear on a television show. I'll be a television writer."" And the director did call action--as they do--and so I was. Just like that.

For the last three years, the sum total of my contribution to this planet (in terms of effort, passion, and things I let myself go soft and pimply for) could be described as follows: *Community*. Recently, I was offered a job writing for *Modern Family*, and although it's unclear what will happen with *Community* for the fifth season (or the sixth season, or the movie), I've decided to take this new position. Tomorrow is my first day and I'm excited and scared to start this new... well, everything. I'm sure the coffee will probably be the same.

This isn't the end of me and Greendale. *Community* was my world for four seasons and my job for three, and has hold of my whole heart like a bad-news high school boyfriend. I'll never really get away. The chemistry is too perfect and the writing room couches aren't really that uncomfortable to sleep on and I just can't stop writing for Britta. Plus I still have to do my editing pass on the finale. I think I left a box in my office, too. Bobrow probably misses me. Better stop by on my way home.

I guess what I'm saying is, it took me a really long time to write this to you guys, and it's not even that good. Pretty sappy, no punchlines, kind of vague about my future with the show, too little excitement about the new gig, etc. Okay, so not my best work. Maybe I'll take it down and not say goodbye just yet. I just need a little more time. 

About three hours longer than it took Duncan to think up this assignment.

**UPDATE**
Wow, thanks for the love, guys. And the banner! I would say I'd be missing you to, but I'll be around. After all, I still owe you all an AMA sometime near the ""October 19th"" premiere. Say... Feb 6th? (I don't want to interfere with CommuniCon so it will probably be before the premiere. First I have to check people's schedules. See if I can't get some cast involved too.) But thank you for being so cool and supportive, and not mutinous and pitchforky like I was worried you might be.

Greetings from [/r/community](/r/community)!

Tonight at 8/7c, a new episode of the TV show Community airs on NBC.


**What is Community?**

Community is a sitcom revolving around a group of misfits during their way through Community College, but it is unlike any sitcom you've ever seen. It's fresh, innovative, and goes where no TV show has gone before - but why tell you, if we can show you:

[Fan made trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2ml1vuZOXc)

[NBC trailer](http://www.nbc.com/community/video/community-returns/1389498) (Contains spoilers for the new episodes!)


**Why do we ask you to watch it?**

Community is critically acclaimed and has a passionate fanbase, but is has poor ratings. This is mainly due to the fact that many people don't know about this show, since NBC has done a poor job promoting it, and the Thursday 8PM timeslot collides with one of the most successful TV shows currently on the air, the ""Big Bang Theory"".

Because of the ratings, it is unclear if the show gets renewed. If the show gets great ratings tonight, it might be the signal NBC needs to give the show a fourth season. This is why we're asking for your help!


**How can you help us?**

First of all:

- Watch the show!

- Tell your friends!

Also, there are some things you can do to actively help the show:

- If you have a friend who has a Nielson box, pay him/her a surprise visit, and watch the show with him/her. The Nielson rating is an important factor for the future of Community.

- Record the show on your TiVo/DVR, and watch it tonight! **DVR views are important, too, [says executive producer Neil Goldman](https://twitter.com/#!/GoldmanNeil/status/180384026929016832).**

- Tweet about the show on Twitter, using the hashtag #CoolCoolCool

- Visit the [Community homepage](http://www.nbc.com/community/) on nbc.com, watch some clips, show NBC that people are interested in this show.

Thanks for your time!

**edit:** Thanks to everyone who helped bringing this post on the front page of /r/all. Several x-posts are #1 in the respective subreddits, too. Thanks to everyone again, let's hope it works! Please keep upvoting this (as I get no karma for this self-post), and don't forget to tweet #CoolCoolCool

Contracts have been signed. The new show runners will be the new show runners no matter what, and there's nothing we can do to change that.

Without Harmon the show loses it's voice. This is worse than the hiatus. This is worse than the show not being renewed. Instead of just letting the thing we love die a dignified death, Sony insists on turning it into a zombie. A lumbering corpse of it's formar self; something devoid real emotion or intellect, but because the virus that it is resides in the corpse of something we once loved, we only watch in horror, afraid to kill it, out of admiration for what it once was. If we can get Dan Harmon back in there we can break the fever and kill the virus, but we only have a month or two to do so before permanent brain damage sets in.

The best way to ensure the show keeps its voice is to start a campaign to get Harmon on as head writer. In addition to that, some position which allows him access to the edit bay is also important. 

We also need to remember who we are targeting here. **The culprit is SONY, *not* NBC.** If we boycott something (just for example), it should be Sony, not NBC. NBC listened to us when they renewed the show. Sony slapped us in the face by ousting Harmon. 

**We also need a plan of action:** 

I hope we all can agree that head writer and head editor is the best and most realistic position for Dan given the reality of the situation, because this is what we need to proclaim in one voice, to Sony.

• One of the first things we need to dig up is **contact info for Sony Entertainment heads**. It specifically needs to be Sony Entertainment. We need to find out who these guys are, we need **personal email adresses**, and we need **mailing adresses** that we can mail Harmon support to.

Achieved:

    Sony Pictures Television, Inc.
    Attn: Steve Mosko (President)
    10202 West Washington Boulevard
    Culver City, CA 90232-3195
    United States

Phone: 310-244-3900

Fax: 310-244-1366

**Email: steve_mosko@spe.sony.com** (still needs to be confirmed)

Another contact. This guy is specifically in charge of Sony TV's comedes:

    Glenn Adilman, Executive VP US Comedy Development
    Sony Pictures Television
    10202 W Washington Blvd
    Culver City, CA 90232

Phone 1: (310) 244-8964

Phone 2: (310) 244-4000

• One thing I've been thinking of is **a simple post card we could produce en mass, with a simple message like ""Hire back on Dan Harmon as head writer and editor!""** It would likely have a darkest timeline goatee or Abed in the goatee and sunglasses. Or some other agreed upon image, or a few choices. As with any post card, there would be room for a personal message on back. We need mailing adresses to get this to work. 

User veeveetickles has made this post card: http://i.imgur.com/s99y2.jpg

Another design I found on Twitter: http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/551828_255139554593615_255104351263802_476259_1462787592_n.jpg

I have personally received permission from the creator of this painting to use it in the capacity of helping get Dan back on the show: http://samspratt.tumblr.com/post/23365596346/sam-spratt-dan-harmon-portrait

• **We could also appeal to the new Show Runners to hire Dan as a writer/editor and urge them to respect his vision.** The new show runners don't *have* to listen to Dan, but we need to urge them that they should extend a hand out to him and personally involve Dan in the show and follow his general blue-print for a 4th season. We would have to do this with respect and tact. We would also need some sort of personal contact info. This might actually be the most realistic idea.

I've found the fan mail address for David:

    David Guarascio
    United Talent Agency
    9560 Wilshire Blvd.
    Suite 500
    Beverly Hills, CA 90212-2401
    USA

...and fanmail for Moses:

    Moses Port
    United Talent Agency
    9560 Wilshire Blvd.
    Suite 500
    Beverly Hills, CA 90212-2401
    USA

Remember, be especially nice to these two dudes. Our favorite show is in their hands.

• Another idea:  I saw this posted on this subreddit not too long ago. It didn't get much traction but I think it's a great idea. Apparently, another show's fandom once got another season by **sending big boxes full of styrofoam peanuts to the respective network (in our case it would be Sony.)** The idea behind this is to create a stink which is big, gets in the way, and is difficult to ignore. What we'd do is have some kind of message in the box or even on the outside of it, telling them to hire Dan Harmon back as head writer and editor.

I may go as far as to get a Kickstarter going for this to pay for the printed materials and postage costs, or boxes, peanuts, and shipping fees. This would create a simple system where you simply throw in a dollar or whatever it would cost and a post card is sent out with your name, adress, and personalized message. 

Any other ideas? Any input to improve this idea?

Edit: FYI, I am editing this as I am receiving input. I've added the contact info for the Sony pres and taken out the ""dead to me"" line I've proposed as many do not like it.

Signing the petition is a good idea too, even if idealistic: http://www.change.org/petitions/prevent-the-darkest-timeline-bring-back-dan-harmon-as-showrunner-for-community",,False,self,t5_2qu49,1337552695.0,,jeff,True,t3_tvb9c,http://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/tvb9c/our_goal_needs_to_be_getting_dan_harmon_rehired/,

And then it opens on the study room, but it's clearly a different set, and the actors are behaving just a little off, in such a way that only a longtime fan would notice. And then the dean walks in, and he's portrayed by a different actor. He makes a joke, and...

there is a laugh track.

And just when all of us are crying into our celebratory wine, it should turn out to be a dream Abed's having or something, and then the normal opening starts, and the show turns out to be everything we'd hoped for and more. 

Because joking about the fans' between-season fears is just meta enough to make me smile. 

edit: Be clear, I'm not suggesting a ""sitcom episode."" The point of this would be to change it subtly enough to make us give up hope for about 1 minute. The laugh track would just be that last straw, and the reveal would be that the show didn't actually change that much.",,False,self,t5_2qu49,1343329500.0,,,True,t3_x6np2,http://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/x6np2/how_i_think_season_4_episode_1_should_start/,

Come join us [/r/hawkthorne](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/). I'll be posting updates and new builds all the time**

Happy Friday human beings! I come bearing gifts. I'm excited to announce the
availability of a new version of Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne. (Download
links at the bottom of the post). Changes include

- Completely overhauled physics engine
- Walls and floors on levels
- Collision detection
- Dirty hippies!

Before you get too excited, the game is still in tech demo phase. You'll notice
that you can only run to the end of the hallway before it finished

**Found a bug? [Report it here][report]**

**Next Steps**

After last post, the manager of the #sixseasonsandamovie art show reached out to me. If we can get this game done by June 17th, it can be in the show. I'm committed to showing something, and hopefully it will be a few levels of a playable game. With that deadline in mind, here are the things I'm working on.

- Make doors work
- Add support for different characters
- Start on level design

You can follow my progress on [the Trello board](https://trello.com/board/8-bit-community/4fb820214ddda944560174f2) I use to keep track of tasks.
The code can be found on [hosted on
Github](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey)

**Helping Out**

People have been asking me all week about what they can do to help. First thing
you can do is download the game, play it, and [report bugs][report].

I also need some official testers. I'll send prerelease builds to you and you get to play them and tell me what you think. [Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFhSaFpUbXdRLWJzXzhwZWpkOFBFMXc6MQ)

For the artistically inclined, I need help with game sprites and background
tiles. On the Trello board you can see the current state of character sprites.
Annie and Abed are finished, but we need help with all the others. If you want
to help out, just comment below and I'll tag you on the card and mark it as in
progress. We don't want people working on the same character.

Many people have asked to help code. You're more than welcome to fork the
repository on Github and start hacking away. I'm not ready to officially take
on collaborators because the code base is still very in flux. My hope is that
in a week the code base will be more solid and ready for people to start
creating levels.

Thanks again for all the support. It better not awaken anything in me.

EDIT: Thanks for feedback everyone. It sounds like there are still some bugs on Windows. I'll work on a fix for the super speed problem later today.

EDIT 2: The hippy now dies! And sound effects! Thanks to all of you who signed up as testers. I hope you like video games :)

We've done a lot of good work thus far, but our work is far from over.  Sure, we've

* Helped Community get on the cover of TV Guide
* Managed to get ""Abed is Batman"" trending on Twitter
* Increased the ratings ever so slightly

And that's great.  The cast knows how much the fans love the show, and they've been [spreading the word](http://www.collegehumor.com/video/6664700/save-greendale-with-the-cast-of-community) and [crossing over](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNDnv0j_xvE) to promote Community.  Support for the show has never been higher, which is why we have to push our absolute hardest for the final 30 minutes we get with the show.  The only way NBC's going to listen to us is by numbers. 

Regardless of where you live, this is what you should do today, starting at 8PM Eastern Standard Time (-5 GMT):

**Engage on Social Networks:**

* Get on Twitter, and for the tweets you send out, use any of the hashtags #GreendaleXmas, #savecommunity, #sixseasonsandamovie, and the mention ""@nbccommunity"".  If you're not following ""@nbccommunity"", follow them.  If you don't have a Twitter account, [create one](http://www.twitter.com/signup), and do it for Community if nothing else.  
* Observe the Twitter Trendsmaps by [meandering over to thanks_meatcat's thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/n51y1/tonights_hashtag_effort_greendalexmas/).  As thanks_meatcat points out, it is absolutely best if we start the hashtags DURING the show, not before or after.  This increases the chances of it becoming a trending topic.
* Get on Facebook, and [like the official Community page](http://www.facebook.com/nbccommunity).  Post a status update here or there today, and include a mention of the Community page (type @community).
* If you have Twitter but cannot watch the show (perhaps due to class), you can text your tweets to the number 40404.


* **SUPER EDIT** [Here is a list of the known advertisers that run commercials during Community.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlkUqRXhD0SAdHktT2lFWnRIU0NCLVVlX0lnMDNDUUE#gid=1)  They may or may not air during this time, but you can keep a list of their hashtags handy!  Thanks to TommyBaseball for creating the Google Doc!
* If you have a GetGlue account, sign in tonight and indictate that you're watching Community.  Thanks to TonicBang for this information.
* If you have a Google+ account, sign in tonight and you can use ""#community"" there as well.  Sponsors have Google+ pages there, and since Google+ has a smaller user base, your comments have the potential to carry more weight.  Thanks to drpfenderson for this info.

**Watch today's episode, however you can**

* Watch the show, live.  Find a way to do it.  
* If you do not live in the U.S., or do not have access to watching NBC in any way/shape/form, [watch a stream here](http://www.stream2watch.me/live-tv/nbc-live-stream)(Thanks PseudoFanboy)
* While watching the show, watch the ads, find the sponsor's specific Twitter account, and tweet to them.  Mention how you just saw their ad while watching @nbccommunity, and thank them for their support.
* If you live in the U.S. and know someone with a Nielsen box, find a way to watch Community in their home.  Anything to help the ratings will benefit.


Social media is obviously our best weapon while the show airs, so let's give it our all during those 30 minutes. If we push hard enough, we can get ""#savecommunity"" to become a trending topic this time.

Most importantly out of all of this, is that you do not give up on the show.  Don't let apathy or pessimism get you down.  Do what you can tonight.  We have to get NBC's attention tonight if we want any guarantee of the show coming back sooner than later.  Laziness is our worst enemy.

**Suggestions for Tweets and/or FB Posts**

For the sponsors that have ads during tonight's Community episode, topical tweets related to Community and their product are encouraged, alongside simply thanking them for buying ad-time during the show.  For example, if Pizza Hut has a commercial during the show:

&gt;@pizzahut every time I see your commercials during @nbccommunity I say Pizza! Pizza pizza me so hun-gee! #savecommunity


**TL;DR**:  There is no TLDR, we have work to do!

**Edit Summary** Thank you to PseudoFanboy for finding a stream for non-US viewers to watch Community as it airs.  Thank you to conceptualworm and the rest of [r/glee](http://www.reddit.com/r/glee/comments/n4o5g/an_appeal_to_gleeks_from_a_fan_of_another_show/) for standing with us and joining the viewership for tonight's episode. Added instructions for mobile tweets, suggested tweets, and GetGlue (thanks TonicBang and Generic_Review) Corrections thanks to KobraCola regarding Facebook tagging (use @community) Thanks to thanks_meatcat for the [Twitter Hashtag thread for tonight's episode](http://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/n51y1/tonights_hashtag_effort_greendalexmas/). Thanks to drpfenderson for pointing out that Community's sponsors have Google+ profile pages.  

**EPIC NEW EDIT** We've found a list of known sponsors that air commercials during Community.  Familiarize yourself with the accounts and send tweets their way during the commercial break.

**TWITTER WORTHY EDIT** #GreendaleXmas is trending!  So is ""Troy and Abed""!  KEEP IT UP FOLKS :D
http://i.imgur.com/9pA4A.png

**FINAL EDIT** That's it for now, folks.  Enjoy it and don't forget to tweet, those of you on the West Coast!  And to those of you who will watch it on NBC.com, thank you!",,False,self,t5_2qu49,True,,,True,t3_n4w3a,http://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/n4w3a/tonight_we_save_greendale/,

Also check out this synopsis from wikipedia:

&gt;Blackthorne is set on the planet Tuul, which has existed for centuries without human knowledge. All of this time, Tuul's people have been ruled over by a single shaman who ""was blessed with all knowledge"". Years before the game begins, Thoros, the latest ruler, finds it near impossible to choose between his two sons as the next ruler...
