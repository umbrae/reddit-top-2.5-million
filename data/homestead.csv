Im finding that homemade almost everything is better than store-bought. The last few months we have switched to making almost everything from scratch from bread, to yogurt to cider and I feel like Ive woken up from the Matrix. Its becoming clear to me that people in the past likely ate better than we do now. Clearly its fun to have access to international cuisines and ingredients but the flavors and freshness of homegrown and homemade are just on another level.

By the standards of the people in this sub we aren't really ""homesteaders"".  We both have fulltime jobs, but we have moved to a half acre in a countryish suburb and are growing a lot of food now.  Almost everything we eat besides staples is grown or raised by us or small farmers within 10 miles radius.  Its just another way to live and Im finding it more fulfilling than the way we used to live.

Of course our lifestyle change is incremental and I know I am preaching to the choir but tasting that icecream just put everything into perspective.

It was delicious. I asked if his wife made it and he told me no, it was my mother. She picked the apples from a tree her and her husband planted 40 years ago. She pealed the apples and hand made the crust from scratch. She baked the pie in a wood fired oven she has used since 1960 burning wood she split herself. 

The loss of this entire amazing scene is heartbreaking to me. When will something like this ever happen again?

I recently did a podcast with Geoff Lawton.  If Geoff Lawton cranked out two internet things a week and posted them here, such that the only thing he ever posted to all of reddit was Geoff Lawton content, I think that would be fucking awesome.  I would upvote it.  That dude has a lot to teach me, and I am tickled pink that there is a way for me to learn a wee bit of it for FUCKING FREE!

The idea that Geoff Lawton should be banned from reddit because he is not posting crap from other people seems ridiculous to me.   Geoff Lawton does not have time for that.  He barely has time to put out the material he is already putting out.  Geoff is working on permaculture level 9 stuff - why should he hunt out and post stuff from permaculture level 2?  Or be forced to find some stupid picture of cats and post that?

I have to bring this up because I have now been officially banned from several subreddits for exactly this.  One mentioned that it is okay to post your own stuff provided that it is only 10% of what you post.  My stalker insists that you may never post your own stuff and follows me around downvoting and reporting all of my submissions.  And probably messaging the moderators of every subreddit I post to.

It is the right of the moderator of every subreddit to ban whoever they like - for any or no reason.  I respect that.  

I wish to make it clear that in this subreddit I will ban people for being icky, or repeatedly posting off-topic stuff, or anything that just seems wrong, but I won't ban anybody for posting only their own stuff.  I want to see good content.  And I like the idea that the content generators are on reddit.  Perhaps a few subreddits  prefer to dissuade the content generators.

Please upvote this message so that everybody can see it.  Thanks!

Hey there good people of Reddit. This is my project, been working on it for three years now, hoping that with your help it can reach the millions of people in the world who could use a little self built energy autonomy. Thanks.

..

The Solarflower is an open source solar energy collector which tracks the sun automatically through a simple non-electrical mechanism.

It can be made almost anywhere from common recycled and salvaged materials using basic tools and skills, is portable, has no running costs or emissions, and can produce up to kilowatts of power per device.

Depending on available resources it should take one to three unskilled people less than a week to build, and cost well under €$£ 100.

Potential examples of use could include:

~ Electrical production with simple steam turbine/piston, with waste heat going to oven or hot water system.

~ Dome oven with integrated water system for temperature regulation and hot/pasteurized water.

~ Steam distillation of water for removal of chemical, heavy metal, and biological toxins.

~ Medium to large scale food dehydration, processing, and roasting.

~ Conversion of fibrous organic waste into charcoal for energy storage and low smoke cooking, with coproduction of bio-oil and bio-gas.

~ And any other application utilizing heat.",,False,self,t5_2s8lc,False,,,True,t3_10fbm1,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/10fbm1/solarflower_an_open_source_scrap_makeable_solar/,

In the northwest corner near the barn there's two pastured areas that have a gate between the two. The top left one is about 1.5 acres, the lower one is about 1 acre. If I pasture the bare looking area west of the driveway I can add about 5.5 more acres. I plan on foresting the bare looking area to the southeast. We're thinking it would be a good place for bees too. 

The area inside the loop is a pond. Think it would be worth it to pasture that in to let livestock use that as a water source or should I just plan on a livestock waterer? I do have water spigots near the barn. 

On the topic of spigots, they are [this](http://dancingfarmer.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/faucet.jpg?w=360&amp;h=270) style, just coming up out of the ground. Do I need to worry about these freezing in the winter? Or does the ground temp stay constant enough for them to work all winter? There is also one in the barn, maybe that one would be less likely to freeze. I do have full electric out there so I could use a space heater on especially cold days. 

We thought we'd start with egg chickens and hopefully chickens for their meat at some point, maybe even turkeys. I've got a family of six and we go through a lot of eggs and chickens. I figure if we're cutting chickens to use for parts and not just eating them whole I'd need to slaughter 3-5 a month just to feed my family. That would be to always have breast, legs, etc in the freezer. 

I would also like to have a small beef herd at some point. The idea for that in my head at this point is to keep a few cows that I breed to raise the offspring for slaughter. Being that I'm looking at maybe 7 acres at the most, keeping a bull would be a waste of acreage for me. 

And of course we'll have a garden somewhere, we're going to get some apple trees and I want to grow my own hops. The previous owners had the garden in the area just southeast of the barn, you can see a small shed in the screenshot of the property. We're considering doing the garden/apple trees there.

Oh and it came with a tractor, a weird off brand Zetor Zebra. I'm not familiar with deep cycle batteries, which I assume this has since it says it's a agriculture battery. But I keep having to jump start it, at first I suspected the battery. It showed 12.2v while sitting but after a crank or two it drops to 6-7v. After sitting for a few minutes it shows 12.2v again. 

Once I get it running it still shows 12.2v so now I'm thinking alternator. I'm assuming a tractor alternator should run at 14 like a car? When I turned the headlights on the voltage at the battery dropped to 11.8.

  ""The Village Blacksmith"" by *Henry Wadswort Longfellow (1807-1882)


In the organic nature of the thriving homestead-sustainable movement, most folks feel that petrochem plastic is nasty stuff to be avoided. I agree. But it does have its uses, such as rammed tire and poly earthbag construction and UV resistant greenhouse liner.

But what about all those plastic bottles containing everything from water to detergent? It is difficult, even for ardent opponents of disposable plastic, to avoid collecting them, and being realistic, there is not a viable return or recycling system. Sometimes they are safely reusable, but not so often.

That is why I began the project I describe here, and submit it for discussion. Please, do not offer comments ""Plastic is baaad! Plastic is baaaaa!"" Yes, we know that, which is why I began my project and why I submit it here for *informative, constructive* criticism.

THE PLASTIC FORGE

I melt plastic. The process is as simple as filling a vessel with oil (vegetable or petro), heating it, melting plastics and molding them into usable shapes or storing it in ingots to be remelted and reused later.

Example: I do not have access to, and do not want, pressure treated wood. All the wood I use is harvested on my property or locally, and usually used as roundwood. Where I live (East Africa) we have termites. They are part of the ecology and we do not poison the numerous and extensive mounds. But living with them can be difficult and costly. When I build a permanent structure that rquires a post embedded in a foundation, I use concrete to protect the wood and for the superior long-term support. That is not practical for temporary structures; too difficult to move and reuse posts that have a huge chunk of heavy concrete on one end. So, I put plastic boots on the portion of these posts that will be in the ground; protects against termites and moisture. It is as easy as dipping the post into liquid plastic obtained by melting the above mentioned bottles, bags, packaging.

With experimentation, I am becoming more adept at forging shapes, such as doughnut shaped spacers/washers that have mechanical and construction applications. Edging glass with plastic moulding to make a homemade window fit tighter with less breakage. Door jam pads.

The process is akin to the ancient craft of blacksmithing. The forge is a cut down metal barrel with oil (recycled waste). Melting plastic floats on the hot oil and can be skimmed, although that is inefficient and hazardous. Better to float an oiled metal container on the hot oil with the plastic melting in that floating container. Or, allowing the melted plastic to overflow through a cleft into a mold made from clay or sand. It cools and hardens in the mold.

Old tires can be smelted this way, but it takes a lot of heat and the tire must be cut into small pieces, which is intensive labor, but we collect scraps from locals who make their living making tire-sole sandals, which are daily wear here. Tires yield strong custom rubber. Plastic consumer containers - water, cola, shampoo, detergent bottles - melt at a lower temperature and are more pliable. (Takes a lot of them; tremendous reduction.) The ubiquitous supermarket plastic bags reduce to virtually nothing; takes hundreds to mold 1 square inch of solid plastic and are best (in my experience) tossed into the plastic bottle mix. Ditto the clear plastic ""window"" of packaging for batteries, electronics, toys.

You might imagine clouds of black, noxious smoke? Only when the temperature is too high. Finding minimum temp for melting producing fumes but not smoke (I wear a respirator and do this in a open shed, and especially solicit comment and criticism from *chemistry-wise* redditors.

I do not propose this plasticsmithing as an answer to the waste problem created by consumer disposable plastics. It might be an option for getting viable re-use instead of dumping into the ever-growing mounds of plastic garbage. Whenever possible, I re-use plastics in their original form. Whenever possible, we buy in bulk, several liters, and decant the contents into reused smaller, more handy bottles.

For example, we sometimes buy 10-liter bottles of drinking water (no lecture please, this is East Africa, we do not have municipal water and sometimes our water source is contaminated by runoff from heavy rain). I made rodent-proof, stackable kitchen canisters from these food-grade bottles. Cut the top off so that the bottom of the next bottle stacks snugly into the open bottle below it. Depth of each is determined by how far down from the bottle neck the top is removed. Last step, cut the bottom from the last bottle and snug it into the stack as a top lid.

Large water and soda bottles exposed to sunlight degrade into useless, vile plastic chips and powder. But by painting the exterior of the jug, the degrading sunlight is blocked and the jugs can be used as flower and seeding pots. (I paint them brown. From a distance of a few feet, they look like clay pots.)

Painted and filled with sand or gravel or water, with a string jugs can be used as counter-weights for fence gates. Or put a post at each end of a row of plants, such as tomatoes, and run a horizontal bar above the row. Toss the bottle string over the horizontal bar and tie it to the plant you might otherwise individually stake to keep it upright. As the plant grows, add weight to the bottle.

I am *not* advocating plastic. I am attempting to deal with them in a positive manner. I hope this helps some of you, and that you offer constructive suggests *and criticism*.

Lastly, I apologize for this long post but I do not have a website or other means of linking to this dialogue posted elsewhere.

We're gonna salvage building materials and build a large community center/initial house. There will be vegetable gardens and fruit trees planted within the first couple months. After a year, I hope for me and my friend to have our own separate houses (he has a girlfriend and child). These will be small houses but will all be run on solar power, wind power, and possibly water power. We will have a well dug if possible and draw from a creek when necessary. There will be chickens, rabbits, and goats within the first year as well. After 5 years or so, we will add a large pond(if there isn't already one), and add ducks and geese, as well as cows. All of the food required for the animals will be grown on the land. There will eventually be a community bakery, carpentry shop, and blacksmith shop on the property. This is not just a dream for us, but one that we are certain will be fulfilled. The more people, the better. If you or anyone you know is interested, please contact me. We can work something out.

I am very curious in sustainable living as well as in innovative and creative techniques. Is there any suggestions people have on what I should do or develop?

I am also a recent university graduate and not much capital available for any big infrastructure investments - just so you have a general idea of where I am coming from and what I am capable of.

1368187541.0,62,self.homestead,1e2bht,"Anyone interested in spending a week or two learning everything you'd want to know about organic farming, by working on my parents' dairy farm in western New York?",78,16,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/1e2bht/anyone_interested_in_spending_a_week_or_two/,"My parents (well, mostly my dad) were really into the whole sustainable farming thing before it was cool.  They've been dairy farming with under 20 milking cows since the 80's.  I've got to hand it to my dad: he's one of a very small number of people that was able to successfully start operating a small farm without having grown up on one.  But my dad's getting near retirement age, and neither me nor my brothers are interested in farming, having spent our whole lives growing up chasing cows and shoveling manure.  But I *know* there are people out there who are really interested in learning about farming, it's just hard for my parents to connect with them, what with the relative isolation that comes from being out in the country.  I mean, they just upgraded from dial-up internet last year.

Anyway, I set my parents up with a WWOOF account last year, and they had a really good experience with a couple that was interested in starting their own farm someday.  But I'm a bit worried that a lot of the people that seem interested are more the head-in-the-clouds flower-child types, that don't understand the concepts of hard work and urgency.  And it seems that mostly girls are interested, too.  Which is fine, it's just that what my dad needs most is help with some of the grunt work that he's starting to get a little old for.  It's hard work, but it's not like it's work from the time you wake up until you go to sleep.

With the moderate isolation and all of us kids having moved out, my parents can get a bit bored sometimes, and they really like having people visit, especially if they're interested in farming.  A lot of the WWOOF farms in the US seem to be run by people that don't really know what they're doing, but my parents are very knowledgeable about most aspects of farming, at least in their climate.

Their farm is on WWOOF, as ""Stick-in-the-Mud Dairy Farm"", if anyone is interested in visiting. (It's the westernmost WWOOF farm in New York state) It'd be best if you contacted them through [WWOOF's web site](http://wwoofusa.org/).  It took them a while to warm up to the idea of strangers coming to visit them through the WWOOF site, and I'm not sure they'd be all that keen on having ""weirdos from reddit"" email them. (They're still a bit new to the Internet)  [Here is the link to their farm on WWOOF, for anyone that is a member and can see it.](http://wwoofusa.org/Profile?UserId=9b49e7fa-aca1-4b24-ad8f-2793bb504089)

They live in the middle of a large Amish community, and are friends with all their Amish neighbors, so if you're interested in learning more about the Amish, you definitely could.

Anyway, here are some random farm-related pictures that happen to be in my imgur account:

We were able to buy  4 unsexed khaki campbells, ended up getting two of each sex, so we always knew a drake would have to go. We also already had two adult mixed breed ducks which no longer lay, so  they had to go to the pot as well.

We have spent the majority of this year talking to people, watching videos, getting pointers etc, and figured that we had done as much prep as we possibly could, and it was time to actually do the deed.
We put the khakis we wanted to keep in an enclosure so they wouldn't see,  and tied and bagged our potential dinner in a shady spot with their necks sticking out.

My husband bopped the first one on the head to stun it; pupils dilated and fixed so it was stunned well, and I held the duck with its neck on the stump and hubby chopped the head off.

I am only little, and I have arthritis, so I didn't *quite* manage to hold the twitching body still enough in time to avoid the spray of blood all over my face. I have always had a pretty weak stomach, so I am proud of myself for holding it together during this.
It was quite disconcerting seeing the neck gyrate around, almost like a badly articulated animatronic thing from a movie. I was feeling a bit queasy, but this is where our food comes from, and I have always strongly believed that I should be able to do this if I eat meat.

Since this bird was older, and was going to be braised, I didn't bother with a full pluck, but breasted it out instead. It went well, though my husband had to pull some of the skin back as my fingers didn't have the strength to do it. I got the breast out, we cleaned up and started on the next one.

I started plucking and the world started going dark... I started to become unable to remove myself from the smell and still warm body and the knowledge that this duck was alive not 2 minutes ago. I told my husband that I was about to pass out, and he stepped up and did the second one while I went to shower the blood off me. I couldn't continue, and he said he was fine.

Unfortunately, he cut the intestines trying to breast it out, so we lost that meat.

Neither of us could do the third drake.

We spent the rest of the day feeling a bit off. The smell seemed to stay in our hands, and I felt a bit depressed that I couldn't manage to continue. I still can't put into words how I felt afterwards. I didn't feel bad per se; it was a quick clean kill, and if I am going to eat meat, that's where it comes from. I treated the birds well, and I believe they felt very little pain.

Is it normal to feel like this after your first slaughter? Does this mean I am incapable of doing it, or does it get easier? I realise that most of my problem is from growing up with buying meat from a supermarket; that I have become completely disassociated from the whole process. 

How did you feel after your first slaughter?


**edit**

I just wanted to thank everyone for sharing their stories, experiences, and help with me. I really do greatly appreciate it. We cooked up our duck for dinner last night, and it was very delicious, and as fixesaxes said, it has completed the process for us and we actually feel better for it.

Having said that, we have thought seriously about our experience and have come to the conclusion that if we cannot do this (we still have the spare drake to go), we will become vegetarians. Not because we/I think killing animals for food is wrong, but I am quite serious about my connection to things, and if I cannot be part of the whole process with a peaceful mind, I will not eat meat. I won't let someone else do what I cannot.

So thank you again for your points of view and your links and your encouragement. I really did take it all very seriously.

* Something else (like an inheritance, lottery, patent royalties or other sum) that enables you not to work in the conventional economy?

We produce goat soap and can't think of a catchy name for our endeavor. It's constant hard work on the farm, and my poor brain can't be creative by the time the day is over.

The men's line is having scents like Gunpowder, burnt electronics, tomato stalk, bacon, pipe tobacco, and Outer space (scentless). The women's line has lavender, lemongrass &amp; dandelion, sandalwood &amp; patchouli, rosemary mint, honey oatmeal, etc. We're working on a top secret hush-hush 3 ingredient simple soap and shampoo for people with allergies also!

Any ideas for the general name of the soap line would be greatly appreciated. ""Naughty nan's"", with a pin-up girl theme is my current favorite, kind of like the B-2's in WW2 had on the side. I like it, but you guys can do better! I've seen the memes you crazy kids have!

The main problem is that A LOT of the good names that I thought I was being so creative to think of have been taken 100's of times over.

Ideas for scents or good goat clip art (legal for profit use) would be great as well!

If someone can come up with a goat themed name that makes me smile and we go with it, I'd be more than happy to send out some oatmeal honey soap samples (or some almost cured white lavender soap) to the winner. As I've just started I've only got a bit, I'm not being stingy with the goods :)

Also, Goatse soap will not happen and I've already been scowled at for suggesting the mold to the wife.

Thanks /homsteading, and keep churning out the ideas that will save us from our consuming the planet!

Yesterday I buried six chickens in a mass grave.  They were ripped apart by a dog.  I raised them all from birth.  They all had names. 

Today, I checked my bank account and I have no money.  Literally.  

I moved away from a good job to pursue this ""sustainable"" life style.  And almost every day I am experiencing some type of kick to the face as described above. But, I still love my life and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. 

I read r/homestead for inspiration on days like today.  And I would love to hear your stories.  What drives you to forsake material goods, to give up on the idea of money, and to bust your ass every day? 
Is it because you've lost faith in consumerism/capitalism? You like being outdoors? You want to minimize your footprint? You want to be self-sufficient? You're worried about climate change/ peak oil and its effects on society?

I need some inspiration.

*EDIT 
Thank you all for the stories and support. I was in a funk when I posted and have definitely been inspired by what most of you had to say.  No homestead animals have died since writing this (though my dog did get hit by a car yesterday but he's recovering) so I think things are improving.  It took six chicken deaths (a total of 15 ducks and chickens over two weeks) for me to finally drop everything and just spend an hour in my fowl pen. It's something I need to do more often and something that is part of the essence of homesteading. Self reliance shows us the fragility of life. Which leads us to appreciate it more. Too often I get stuck lamenting a loss and not appreciating what I have.  Anyway, long story short... THANK you for sharing your experiences.  Now we can all live a little through the eyes of others.

We've done a lot of work outside: landscaping, moving and expanding the garden, some minor clearing (for firewood mostly), building a greenhouse and a firewood shelter. We had big dreams of fencing off, getting goats/chickens/guinea fowl.

This year, the garden was a complete bust because of a record low level of sun. In the spring the partial basement flooded, then the septic backed up into the crawlspace (2 weeks of evenings of me cleaning it up by myself by soaking it up with pine pellets then shoveling it out). Then the basement flooded again (coming up through the sump hole). Our shallow well is built from metal culvert, and now it's rusting to pieces...our water is horrible. In November, our dog pulled the return line from the external heating oil tank, and many litres went into the soil, then into the drain tile around the foundation, then into the sump hole in the basement, causing our house to smell very badly of heating oil. I called insurance on that one, and other than a $1000 deductible, they will cover the cost...though we've got a cardboard wall and plastic sheet preventing the -15 degree cold from coming in. We went to my bro-in-laws for Christmas, and when we came back, I had a hard time facing coming back into this house.

Like I said, big dreams of our life in a country home, but this house is ruining it. How do I keep going at this when every time I turn around another catastrophe is on the horizon?

It shouldn't be so. A person asked that question in the year 1450 (in Europe, at least... guess I'm closet Euro-centric) would have far fewer ready answers. Potatoes couldn't be on that list, or potatoes or chilis/peppers. Even some of the more common fruits were unavailable to them.

I replied with this message to someone looking for chicken coop designs, thought I would show the rest of you!

I live in a residential neighborhood, have 5 hens, and this is what I came up with.
I bought the wooden coop which has a roost and the roof flips open for easy cleaning. It also has a tray that catches their poop and slides out for cleaning. The entire front flips down into a ramp to enter and exit. The coop sits on an old wagon my kids use to play with. It makes the 4 legs of the coop sit about 2 inches off the ground. Then I built two 10 foot long PVC frames with bird netting zip tied on for their run. Since we live in a fenced backyard I've never been worried about critters attacking. Lastly I attached a 5 gallon bucket on the back of the coop as their nest box, and put a little wooden door on it for egg retrieval.

This whole system is extremely portable, and It's so easy, most of the time my kids move it. Really, it is a 3 piece system. I do have two bungee cords attached to the first frame to the coop, but it's really not necessary, it just pulls the first frame when you move the coop, so you don't have to move 3 pieces separately.

I paid $100 for the wooden coop, and spent a little over $35 to build the two PVC frames (3/4 inch) with netting (double layered).
Had this system for 6 months and works great! Couldn't be happier! Good luck!

How feasible is this?,54,10,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/129klf/im_somewhat_interested_in_building_an_earthbag/,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit, so let me know if I've made a mistake.

For the time being, I want to gather some information on building a home like this. I'd want to build it either on my own or with a small crew. I want to have solar panels for electricity, and some kind of off-grid water system like what earthships have (rain-gathering roof + cistern and water filters, then a normal septic tank for blackwater). Even better if I can build in some kind of garden to feed me year-round.

How feasible is all of this? I'd definitely have to contract out the plumbing and electricity, but it's not as if it's unheard of to have at least partly solar-powered homes with batteries and whatnot. I'm just not too sure about the rain catchment and plumbing.

As far as size goes, I have to read the earthbag book I got off amazon, but I'd basically want a two bedroom home with the normal kitchen and living room. So maybe two domes, or three if I want the house to be bigger. But since I'd be doing the construction mostly alone, I'm not sure. I imagine it'll take a long time to build.

I know I'm being very specific, but if there are alternatives to any of the things I've mentioned then I'd love to hear them.

While things eventually fell through, and I left that job, I fell in love with the desert. I don't know what it was. Maybe the blue skies everyday, maybe just that almost comforting dry heat. I really enjoyed it.

I'm back in the midwest now (Indiana), and am searching the nation for land. There are a lot of very affordable undeveloped 'off the beaten path' type of acreage in the northern Nevada, all of which is 'off the grid'. (No electric, water or sewage provided) all of which is very affordable. The only other places I have found with cheaper land is near the New Mexico / Mexico border which doesn't seem ideal. Too hot, and too dangerous as far as I am concerned.

Now, I'm 24. When I was in High School I was hoping to have had 5-10 acres for myself somewhere by the time I was 25. I'm a little off-track (okay, really off-track) but I would like to purchase land soon. Some of these plots, from what I can see, are absolutely beautiful as per the photos provided. I'd love to purchase a plot, and move there after I've begun to save up a bit more to where I can realistically relocate there.

Does anyone here have any good words of advice or warning when purchasing 'off the grid' land, especially somewhere very secluded?

Ideally, I forsee myself getting a camper trailer to place on the property. Something that could easily be powered by solar, easily heated/cooled. (Hell, I could stack bails of straw around the outside for better insulation). From there, I'd begin saving and getting the land ready for a strawbail or earthbag constructed home. I like the idea of having a small-to-medium sized greenhouse of sorts.

I have a job I can perform from home, so long as I have an internet connection. I suspect my only reliable source of internet in this situation would be via satellite. Solar electricity, satellite internet, and now I all I am lacking is fresh water, and a place for waste to go. With no plumbing, what would be feasible options for dirty water and sewage?

We make cheese and sell it to shareholders through a local co-op as well as at a farmer's market. We also have a large garden that supplies most of our fresh vegetables. There's an opportunity to volunteer at the co-op too on your days off, which can be a lot of fun.   

Some of your duties would be learning how to herd the goats out into the surrounding forested canyons and BLM land, making all kinds of yummy cheeses, and tending to the garden.  

We are all really into food here, so expect to eat awesome meals.  If you love to cook, you'll do very well here!  

There is one full-time person here, as well as two wwoofers that are here for the season (I am one of them).  We are 27 and 30 years old, and the full-time person is a super awesome 61 year old lady who works harder than all of us put together.  Someone just recently left, and we need one more person to balance out the work load.    

The requirements are 20-25 hours a week, and there is a small stipend offered.  Most of the chores are completed in the morning, and we have a huge chunk of the day to ourselves to read, write, hike, relax.  

There is wireless internet that is run off of solar panels, so you won't be completely out of touch!  You could stay in the yurt, or sleep in a tent; it's up to you!  You could even sleep outside in just your sleeping bag.

1350694722.0,39,self.homestead,11s0qq,My environmental liberal arts college needs some support in the form of words :),56,17,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/11s0qq/my_environmental_liberal_arts_college_needs_some/,"Recently my college ([Green Mountain College](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Green-Mountain-College/137783307864?rf=103787696326464&amp;ref=stream))has made the decision as a community to slaughter our oxen (who work as a draft team on the college farm), Bill and Lou. I have not worked on the farm for quite some time, but I do believe fundamentally in sustainable agriculture. Over the past couple of years, our farm has worked with students writing grants to purchase large storage freezers so the company who run our dining hall can purchase produce directly form the farm instead of from outside distributors, as well as purchasing meat from animals that were raised on the farm. 

As I said above, we have recently made the decision as a community that Bill and Lou are no longer able to be used as a draft team. Lou has sustained a few injuries over the summer and has not recovered. We decided that the most sustainable thing to do is to slaughter them, then serve them in the dining hall. After the decision was made, some alumi and other dissenting individuals brought the issue to VINE (veganism is the next era), an animal sanctuary. They offered to take on the oxen at no charge to the college, but we have stood by our decision to provide locally sourced, sustainably raised beef to the dining hall while at the same time avoiding using precious resources on animals that can no longer work (and one that is in incredible pain, unable to walk more than fifty feet at once).

When VINE heard that we wouldn't take up their offer, they became outraged and since then our school's facebook page has been bombarded with incredibly harsh statements regarding our levels of compassion, how we are all lemmings following our professors off the cliff, how we will never get a job with Green Mountain College on our resumes, et cetera. Professors are receiving hate mail. The students are attempting to reason with people, but they are so slanderous and disrespectful that it is difficult. People internationally and others from all over the US have been decrying our decision, the Huffington Post ran an article titled ""Green mountain College's Faux Environmentalism,"" and we really need some help on the offensive.

I've come here to hopefully get the word out to people who are interested. I want to make sure I'm not presenting myself as a person who thinks veganism is in some way wrong, I just don't think it realistically fits with an institution that is attempting to serve 700 students three meals daily. Also it should be known that our dining hall has excellent vegan and vegetarian options. 

But anyway! If you support the sustainable ag way of life, I would really appreciate it if you could show some support for the school's decision. We are being berrated by an incredible amount of negative energy for what I see as an upstanding, progressive decision and could use some support. Thank you for your time! I'd be glad to answer any questions I can regarding the situation.

It has a small 1.5 story cabin/rancher (~800 sq feet, single level with loft) on it with water (spring, gravity fed), septic, and electrical/phone hookup.

I've been dreaming of living a self-sufficient lifestyle for what feels like a long time (I'm 31), but I'm worried about making a living.  I'm currently working a good job in an urban centre that I will have to quit to get out to my property.  The mortgage payments are low, but I'm really curious if there's any way to make enough of a profit from my land to sustain my living there, or if I will have to have work elsewhere on top of everything.  This seemed like a good place to ask what peoples' experiences are with cost of living on a homestead property.

Here are some additional details on the proprty if it'll help in the 'assessment"".

Although it's 7.5 acres, a good 4.2 acres of that are wet ground.  I'm hoping to figure out a way to drain this part of the property so as to make it arable or pasture, but as it stands right now I don't think it useful for much of anything (but I'm no expert).

Of the remaining 3.3 acres, about 1 full acre is already cleared and has the small house on it, plus some outbuildings, a good sized garden and greenhouse, and a few fruit trees (cherry/apple).  The rest is treed and slopes up in a northerly direction (so the entire slope face is south-facing, and would get a good amount of sunshine if cleared and if I put in a terraced garden of some sort).  The climate in the area is fairly mild, with 160 frost-free days per year, an average low for the year of 2.7 C (36.9 F) with the lowest average being -6.4 C (20.5 F) in January, and an average high for the year of 9.9 C (49.8 F) with the highest average being 21.3 C (70.3 F) in July.  Average yearly precip is 52 inches, with average for March to September ranging from 2.0 to 3.8 inches/month.

So, basically my questions revolve around the feasibility of having a sulf-sustaining living with what I have, enough to pay my bills and enjoy life.

Seems like a really affordable way to start a homestead on a plot of land.

There are many companies that assemble these ""sheds"" in a warehouse, then deliver them as a complete unit. They come in all sorts of sizes from a little 10x12 storage shed (Lowe's sells one with a loft for just 2 grand), up to 500+ square feet for $10k and up. Many of the companies take custom orders.

A foundation is not required, just a graded pad of gravel. It is probably favorably taxed as well, being a ""temporary"" building.

They come unfinished and uninsulated: just a shell of a structure. It seems straightforward to add insulation, sheetrock, a wood stove, electricity, plumbing and so forth to turn it into a home.

A few weekends back, I was talking with a buddy of mine about my plans to purchase a few dozen acres of land in southern MO northern AK, and he mentioned tossing down some wild corn and blackberries, as a sort of ""just in case"". 

Got me thinking, what can I realistically grow completely ""hands off"" that I could expect to come back year after year?  I'm not looking for something to sustain me long term, but perhaps supplement a few weeks disaster bag, or even ideally longer while I got a proper garden going?  Honestly, this is being overly cautious rather than something that I want to invest a ton of time and energy into; the property will be a weekend getaway type spot for us for camping and the like, this would just be a little added bonus if it's a realistic idea.  

I should note, when I say ""hands off"", I could realistically put in a days work a couple times a year at least, so planting / harvesting / clearing could happen, if necessary.

1338991174.0,40,self.homestead,unxp4,Trying to plan an escape from the city and start a small sustainable homestead... and need advice from the pros.,46,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/unxp4/trying_to_plan_an_escape_from_the_city_and_start/,"Greetings homesteaders!

I'm a long-time lurker on this subreddit and have always enjoyed the inspiration and information provided. I'm using a throwaway account to hide these plans from my current employers and family, who know nothing of them so far. Here's a quick synopsis of our scenario: 

My wife and I are in our early 30s and have 2 daughters younger than 4 yr old. We currently own a small home and have conventional city/tech jobs in the southwest US. For the second half of our 20s we've been striving to be 100% free from debt, and with the exception of our mortgage we now have no debt at all. Since this is a relatively recent accomplishment we also have very little savings, but expect it to grow over the next 6-12 months to about 10-15k. 

For the past 5 years or so we've been growing vegetables and herbs. It started as a small garden(30s.ft) with tomatoes, basil, cucs, kale and swiss chard, and grew into ~200s.ft of garden with variety of veg. Because of our hot and sunny climate we can basically grow year round, but it's super dry and required a ton of irrigation. For the past couple years we've had nothing but bountiful harvests and have loved the experience of growing most of our own food.

Along the way we learned the basics: composting, organic fertilizers, raising chickens, perserving, etc. All from our 1/5 acre backyard. It's been wonderful. But cramped. It's time to upgrade to the next level.

Since we got out of debt and have felt more freedom in general, our main goal in life has been to leave the city and find a small rural home and try to start a sustainable homestead that can provide everything we need. Plenty of chickens, a few pigs &amp; sheep, and a cow. We're not looking to create a business of farming, instead just a lifestyle that can provide most of what we need - food, clothes, the basics. Anything we produce in surplus would be shared with those who need it. 

Here's our main dilemma, that I hope some of you may be able to offer advice about: Without a shitload of money, our dream seems impossible.

We've looked all over the country and the NE region seems to be the ideal location. Best prices, climate, and culture. Even though that region has some of the best deals in the nation, they're still way outside of our range. We'd need to save for many years before we'd even have a chance at being able to afford a small 5-10 acre plot with an old farmhouse. 

Our home in the SW won't be selling any time soon,  and our job experience is such as to be rooted directly in to the city life- both which compound the problem.

With our current incomes we'd have a chance of qualifying for a second home loan, but I fear that once we leave our city lives we won't be able to qualify for anything ever again... I've suggested the idea of buying a home and land NOW(before we up and leave the city) and then short-sell our city home later on. My wife thinks it would be nearly impossible(or at least extremely risky) to buy something remotely since we could be flying all over the country looking at properties. I'm starting to think it's our best shot, although extremely risky.

How do small families with modest incomes unplug from the city life? It seems like the cards are stacked against us. We can wait till our 40s and our kids are half-grown, but we'd like to try to make it happen sooner than later.

Any advice or thoughts are welcome. Also, send any rich heiresses or retiring farmers our way and we'd gladly run their property for them. :)",,False,self,t5_2s8lc,False,,,True,t3_unxp4,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/unxp4/trying_to_plan_an_escape_from_the_city_and_start/,

We're moving into a old farmhouse July 1st on a one acre plot of land. It had about a third of open area, a little more than a third as woods, and the rest is the house and front yard. The best thing is that the house is zoned for agriculture so we can produce and sell right from our home! 

Our goals are to produce eggs, produce, fish, fruit, honey, beer, and herbs primarily for us to eat but also with the idea that we'd like to give it away to our families and possibly sell it at our local farmers market or right out of our driveway. 

I've been gardening my entire life and produce about 20% of all the food we're currently eating. However, I have very little experiencec with chickens, fish, and bees. 

Any information, books, movies, podcasts, personal stories, WHATEVER that can help us on our way would be greatly appreciated. Our goal is to produce year round, at least half of the food we're consuming. We're a family of six who eats almost entirely vegetarian.

I'm 17 years old, and all my life all I have wanted to do is live in the country. Right now, I'm working through my A-Levels (I think that's the equivalent of finishing high school) and everyone is pressuring me to arrange work placements, do extra things so I can get into a good uni and the like which is making me think of the very near future, and it's pretty depressing!

To put it simply, my biggest fear is to end up working the rest of my life in some crappy office job that I hate, simply trading hours of my life away for some money so I can keep myself going and fade into insignificance and trying to entertain myself during the hours I'm at home by spending money on things. But unfortunately, that seems to be the expectation. More worryingly, to get a 'good job' the chances are I'd have to live in London, an idea that I cannot express in words how much I'd hate. I cannot stand cities, least of all London. I hate my home town which is pretty small, we live in the suburbs of it.

They can all go off and chase money among the crowds and noise and traffic, spend the best part of their life in education and still be unable to get a decent job after £50K worth of student debt. I want no part in it.

So, I've established that that kind of lifestyle isn't for me, but where to begin? Homes and land are expensive in the UK, and you have to look hard to find bits of countryside that could be called beautiful in which you could live. The kind of places I like are colder climates with pine forests and plenty of space. I'm thinking somewhere like Canada or Scandinavia. 

This won't go down too well here, but I'm not sold of the self-sufficient idea. I just don't think it's something I could manage! I was hoping to work as something I love do get enough money in. I'm a very hands-on sort of person, and although my school and surroundings are very academic, I'm not that sort of person. For the last year, I've been learning to become a blacksmith as a hobby, I'm decent enough at it now, producing some good knives and axes. My decorative stuff isn't great, but I understand the fundamentals and definitely have enough to become an apprentice with. I'm also good with electronics and electrics as well as woodwork. I tend to learn practical skills quite quickly.

I think the best way to do this is to say what I want, it's probably unrealistic, little more than a dream at the moment, but perhaps you could tell me how to get there. I see myself in a reasonably sized log cabin built myself, working as a blacksmith, land bought and paid for and money enough to buy a decent bit of food. I like my luxuries, I'd want a fire, running water, power and internet which may be difficult/expensive. But I'm a bit of a PC enthusiast, custom watercooling and the like, so I'd like to be able to peruse that and stay in touch with the rest of the world. I'd like to have my own decent bit of woods, maybe a lake as well. It'd be nice to take my SIII Land Rover with me as well which I've just rebuilt the engine on and welded up the chassis.

The problems I see are the obvious issues of logistics. A place to stay while I'm building, transportation of some of the stuff I need to take with me. Finding work and connecting myself to the grid for power/internet. Not sure if a generator would be practical as it would require fuel, and I'd likely use a fair bit of power. The main emphasis for me would be not having to worry constantly about maintaining the everyday things which I currently take for granted, things like sewage and power. Obviously I'd need to do a decent amount of work which I expect, but I'm not sure if I could live with some of the things I've read on here which sounds something between a toilet and a compost heap!

I'd better stop here! I hope you don't mind pointing me in the right direction here as in a lot of ways, this isn't strictly homesteading. I'm looking to work for a living and want to keep a lot of the luxuries. But this is mainly about going back to what I enjoy. There was I time when I used to do gardening, hunting, fishing and walking all the time, and it was virtually all I cared about. But school and work are pulling me away from this outdoor lifestyle, as well as the rapid development of my once rural area, and I'd like to claim it back! Simple life, work I love without being completely isolated technologically- that's what I'm after!

To answer these questions would likely be a full written report, so recommended reads would probably be the best way to go!

1356274586.0,35,self.homestead,15bsfc,Balancing homestead wants with typical American house design.,46,11,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/15bsfc/balancing_homestead_wants_with_typical_american/,"My wife and I live in a horrible crowded subdivision where we can't have a garden without neighborhood kids pulling up the plants, terrorizing my autistic son, etc. It's been going downhill since we bought it four years ago and we want to get out before the neighborhood becomes toxic.

My in-laws visited yesterday and told us that my wife's grandparents were giving my in-laws their inheritance now as the taxes will go up significantly after 2012. As part of this, they offered us access to my wife's inheritance now so that we can get out of this house, find some land, and build. We're looking at between US$250,000 and $300,000 total. 

Here's the rub: My wife is 95% on board with living a homesteading life. She wants goats, gardens, chickens, etc. but she also wants a nice traditional house and standard contemporary luxuries such as a big energy-inefficient fridge, a house bigger than we need, etc. My in-laws are neocons who live in a McMansion and want us to do the same. If I had my way I'd build an earth-sheltered house, strawbale, cob, etc. and be completely off grid. 

I'm trying to find the right balance to approach in this matter so that we can build something resilient that will also satisfy my wife and in-laws. I'd prefer to spend a large chunk of the budget on the land and build a small house we can eventually add onto, but with compromises I don't think this will happen. I envision my wife and I probably agreeing on a tradionally-built house that utilizes passive solar that is hooked up to the grid (I can add off-grid supplementary power later), a well, and at least 10 acres. 

We're located in NW South Carolina USA. I'm 34, my wife is 29, and we have two kids at 9 and 1. We plan on having one or perhaps two more kids. I will probably continue to work in telecom for another 5-10 years putting my 50k salary into savings and land improvements until hopefully I've built up the land enough so we don't need too much outside income. 

My questions:


1. Does anyone have any suggestions on places we can find good plans? I love the houses at CountryPlans.com but they're too small for the 4bedroom, 2.5 bath minimum my wife/in-laws want. I'd love to find a slightly scaled-up version that still incorporates passive solar design, cross-ventilation, etc. instead of standard plan sites that assume you have HVAC on 24/7.

2. What homesteading house features are very important to add when the house is first built and which can be added easily later? I'm sure we'll have a HVAC, but I also want a backup wood stove and radiant floor heating and perhaps we should go ahead and wire the house for off-grid power even if that power won't be added in for 5-10 years?

3. What's the minimum amount of land I should settle for? I want enough so that we can eventually sell a few acres to my brother or another close friend so they can be neighbors and enough for a small pastured livestock operation and Permaculture garden. I'm thinking 15 acres is my minimum and while I'd love 100 acres it's out of our price range.

",43,9,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/v6o5w/building_a_homestead_and_need_advice_on_managing/,"Hello fellow homesteaders, I was hoping to get your opinion on my current situation. I'm in my late 20s and have bought a nice piece of land (~15acres) about 25 miles outside the city of a half million where I currently work. The land currently has no improvements, and is a mix of approximately 10 acres of gentle rolling hills and about 5 acres of cleared pasture near a creek. I have many plans for the land that include fruit trees &amp; bushes, a vineyard, large gardens spanning several acres, ponds, and paddocks for chickens and ducks. My business plan involves selling my products at farmers' markets and to local food distributors. Once I have these systems in place I'd like to work the agrotourism and education angles by hosting school field trips and teaching/hosting community education on topics relating to gardening, permaculture, and small scale ag. I understand that building and maintaining all of these systems will take a number of years and involve a tremendous amount of effort, so I would eventually like to host WWOOFers on my land to help me maintain the land and run the business. In my plans I have set aside an area for 2-3 small guest houses that would house farm interns. 

In the meantime, I'm working my 9-5 in the city, making good money which allows me to pay down the mortgage on the land fairly quickly. Despite having a 25 year term on the mortgage I'm on track to pay the loan off in 6 to 7 years. Now my dilemma is the old compromise between time and money. I have all these great plans for my land, but I don't feel like I have as much time as I'd like to implement them. I find myself sitting in a cubicle at work wishing I could be outside on my land. Some days it makes me pretty miserable, other days I take comfort in the stability of having a constant paycheck and aggressively paying down my mortgage. 

My question is this: at what point should I quit my job and start homesteading/market gardening full time? I wish I could do it tomorrow, but I'd deplete my saving pretty quickly without replacing my income. 

On the most conservative end of the spectrum, I could wait until I've paid off my land, built a house and paid it off, and have a substantial amount of savings. This would allow me to be a full time homesteader in my mid 30s. 

On the more risky end of the spectrum I could save up enough money to float my mortgage for 2 years, quit my job, and try to earn a living off my land. This would help me escape the cubicle, but I'd be taking a bigger risk than I'm typically comfortable with. 

Somewhere in between these extremes would be the idea of building the food systems and a house while I'm still employed and switching over once I have adequete saving to float any remaining debt for a few years. This is the track I'm currently on, but it is slow and I feel like I'm making little progress towards my goals. 

I know everyone's situation is unique, but I'm hoping that someone in the community can give me some ideas or encouragement to help me jump start my dreams. Are there any government grants that I could take advantage of to help me take the plunge and ease the transition? I've looked into the USDA specialty crop grant but it seems to be mainly awarded to universities and large producers. Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated.

I chased off the possum and saw a steady trickle of blood coming out of the chicken's neck. I put it safely in the coop and it literally slumped over. Too broke to take it to the vet. What do I do? My current plan is to be effing bummed about it, check it in the morning and probably bury it. We lost 2 chicks in the past few weeks and I think this may be why. What can I do about the possum? I have a fenced in back yard and a more securely fenced in chicken coop, but we don't usually keep the chickens in there, just letting them roam the back yard. My first post here, any opinions and information will help. As well as any of your own stories of failures or tiny chicken sorrow.  thanks

**UPDATE:** The chicken yet lives, which is a bit of a relief. I'm still worried it will die from the injuries but I really don't know much about chicken durability and longevity. There's been a lot of great tips and advice and empathy, thank you all! I was wondering what secures a yard from possums and what secures a coop from possums.

1334678650.0,36,self.homestead,secxy,Everything Outhouse,40,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/secxy/everything_outhouse/,"The outhouse or privy is one subject that seems to be totally missing from /r/homestead. We need to disgust this subject before we are knee deep in poo (several puns intended, sorry). 

The outhouse was a staple on the homestead since man began to poop. It has only recently gone out of fashion and mostly because of government regulations. Don’t get me started on ‘regulations’ or I’ll be flinging poo for hours. There are ways around them. 

I grew up in Iowa over half a century ago and most farms back then didn't have running water to the house. A windmill pump at the livestock tank was it. Outhouses were a necessity and were everywhere. 

I currently own two homes and both are equipped with an outhouse. I don’t normally use the outhouse for poopin but it is there when needed, and it has been needed. Sooner or later your septic system will need maintenance or your water system will fail and according to Murphy (that poophead) it will happen and at the worst possible moment. There are few things in life that you absolutely have to do, and poopin is one of them. 

If you can find an outhouse that someone doesn't want, get it, haul it and set it up. You will thank me when it's -20F and the wind is blowing 40mph and the toilet isn't flushing or the water is frozen. It's amazing how fast a -60F wind-chill can frostbite your ass. 

To keep the County property inspector at bay I cover the seats with a piece of plywood and use my outhouse for garden tool storage. It keeps my tools dry and my mind at ease knowing it is there if needed, and it makes a wonderful looking garden shed. 

If you really need modern conveniences run electric to the outhouse, put in a small space heater and lights. At my lake cabin I have a CAT6 network run to mine so I can poop while surfing Reddit and the view of the lake is awesome. I may be sitting here right now poopin and typin, I’ll never tell. 

Try to set your outhouse where it will have a great view but not be too far from the house. It gets cold running to the outhouse at night during a blizzard in your robe. Always set your outhouse up so the door faces away from the prevailing winter winds, it really sucks to get a crotch full of snow when someone opens the door during a blizzard. And yes, my outhouses are two holers so you can poop with a friend. I find it sad that this went out of fashion. I mean you eat with your friends don’t you, so what’s the problem? 

Decorate your outhouse and make it comfortable. I put in real toilet seats for comfort (I’m old). Every year I get a new outhouse calendar and I have covered the walls with outhouse calendars from years gone past. Hang an old chalk board or new white board on the wall for outhouse graffiti (chalk will still work at -40F). Outhouse humor is the best. A nice paint job tied to a theme will really spiff it up. If you have the skills and tools, build something spectacular, a place you would be proud to poop in. 

For the smell (what smell?) throw some wood ash from the stove down the hole to keep the stank down. Hang your toilet paper somewhere where the mice won't get it or they will. A urinal for the guys is a  nice addition to keep the seat clean. Hang a LARGE funnel (some guys have very bad aim) on the wall with a hose running to a hole under the seat to drain. 

Some complain that they are afraid a spider might bite them while seated on the throne. Believe me, your ass it way too big for a spider to eat so you have no worries. If you have spiders large enough to eat your ass make a SciFi movie. You’ll get used to it and the more you have to go the quicker you'll get used to it. If you are too sissyfied to use an outhouse you better stay in your condo, you ain't tough enough to live out here in the woods. 

Now it’s time to have some fun. I know a lot of you have a treasure trove of outhouse stories, jokes and advice. You know you want to tell it, well we want to hear it. Relieve yourself, the more shitty the puns the more upvotes. 

TL:DR this article contains more crap than a politician.

It was so upsetting I'm still a little sick  to my stomach. (then again I did just eat fast food) That's the last straw for me though, I'm not going to fast food ever again. 

I've been planning a self sustaining farm for a while now but haven't started gathering funds because I just bought a house and we need this or we need that. But after seeing one of those.. I'm pretty ready to stop relying on the system and start taking care of myself. I'm going to start putting money aside for my farm right away. 

My dream farm is in the Texas Hill Country. I want Dairy goats (or maybe even sheep) , chickens, an orchard, and enough food in my garden to support myself and whoever else wants to come build a house on our land. My husband wants to build the house himself. There will be solar panels on the roof, a well, and a rainwater collection system.  By then I want to be able to make all of our clothes. Preferably I would have over 12 acres but 6 should do it if I'm short on funds. We would like to be close enough to a national park that we could rent out log cabins.

Some friends and neighbors of ours have two city lots adjacent to one another, totaling about 11000 sq ft. (80x140).  The lots are empty (they used to have houses on them, but they've long been razed), and are currently occupied by only an overgrown raspberry bramble and unruly apple tree.  

My wife and I offered to purchase the lots from them, but they've indicated they don't want to sell them quite yet.  They did, however, agree to lease the land to us for next to nothing (enough to pay the property taxes which I believe are $200/ year total) provided we use the land to farm.  

At the moment, we're leaning towards planting primarily fruit trees (the area receives full sun), possibly expand our current garden, eventually have a chicken coop, and (if possible) plant two rows of hop rhizomes. Of course, we're also toying with a nut tree or two (black walnut? Hazelnut?). 

We already produce more food than the two of us can consume with our current set-up until we upgrade our freezer and basement storage.  Our primary motivation is to ""farm"" on a micro-scale largely just for the experience and sell the produce to our existing contacts within the slow-food/ farmers' markets around town (we've a lot of experience with markets and growers and we've already had offers to purchase some of our harvest this year).   

A few other bits: 
-We're in zone 5b
-we keep bees
- the area isn't fenced, and we would want to avoid putting up a fence the first year.

1295123811.0,32,self.homestead,f2y77,x-post of something I just wrote for /r/Beer.  To anyone thinking of moving out to the boonies and living the dream:  It's not all rocket stoves and vegetable gardens.  Living out here can be HARD.  Here's how I spent the past 24 hours.  ,38,6,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/f2y77/xpost_of_something_i_just_wrote_for_rbeer_to/,"Here's my story:

My girl and I have been away from home for a week. While we were gone, a storm dumped about a foot and a half of snow on our town in VT. When we got back last night, my Jeep made it half way up our 1/4 mile long steep dirt driveway before I drifted off the side into some 3 or so foot deep snowpack.

We put on the snowshoes that I borrowed from a buddy (captain foresight beats captain hindsight any day) and broke trail the remaining 1/8 mile uphill to the house. It was 2°F, she was carrying about 20lbs. of gear, and I was carrying closer to 50.

When we got to the front door, the adventures continued! The cold weather had made it impossible to unlock the deadbolt. To top it off, she had started to come down from her adrenaline rush. This meant realizing she had rolled her ankle. It also caused her to throw up her dinner from the exertion of getting up the driveway.

Not about to break a window, I made my way around to the side of the house. I used the crampons (claws) on the bottom of my snowshoe to dig the ice away from the storage/garage door, and made my way inside.

We threw down our gear. At around 11 she passed out in bed from exhaustion. I stayed awake until 12:30 ruminating the thoughts of the tasks that lay ahead of me the next morning. Fix the lock or break the door. Clear all 1/4 mile of my driveway. Somehow rescue my Jeep from 3 feet of hardpack snow.

I awoke the next morning and got down to business. I disassembled the the lock and brute forced the deadbolt open. I put it together and paused to have a cup of coffee. Next, I replaced the shear pin I broke on my snowblower last storm and fired up the tractor. Blew all the snow off my driveway and cleared out the parking area. Shoveled the walk and laughed at the mysterious chunky brown and orange ice next to the front door.

Now for the big one. Time to rescue the Jeep. I started by snowblowing a wedge shaped area behind the Jeep that would let me ease it back on to the driveway. Almost got the tractor stuck twice doing that! I tried backing it out. A lot of rocking, burned rubber, and noise; but I didn't move an inch. I walked back to the house for a shovel.

I dug a 2 foot wide perimeter around the jeep. The top foot and a half of it was snow, and it gave me little resistance. The bottom foot and a half was hardpack from a few previous storms. I used a hatchet to cut it into 2'x2'x1.5' blocks, then threw them into the woods. I dug out the snow from under the jeep as best I could, crossed my fingers, locked the differential, and threw her in reverse.

Popped right back onto the driveway like there wasn't even any snow on the ground. (must have been because I removed it all)

I whistled ""[still alive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RthZgszykLs#t=0m55s)"" while I threw the shovel in the back of the Jeep and drove to the house. This was a triumph. I'm making a note here, huge success.

I should probably get to the point, huh? It is currently 3:19, Saturday afternoon. The first beer I've had since Thursday night is a Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier.

Has everything I've done in the past 24 hours improved the taste? You bet your ass it did.

Just a little story I thought some of you would find interesting.  Hopefully you can learn from my mistakes!

TLDR: I got my Jeep stuck and we had to snowshoe up to my house last night. My girl rolled her ankle and vommed. I spent the better part of today fixing my front door, snowblowing, and digging my Jeep out. The first beer I've had in nearly 48 hours is a German Hefe. It's the best beer I've tasted in a long time.

For you potential homesteaders, I wanted to show that there are two sides to the coin.  It's great to have a lot of land and be self sufficient.  However, the downside of self sufficiency is having to do everything yourself when things go right, and when things go wrong.  Normally, my neighbor could have chained my Jeep to his truck and pulled me out no problem.  Thing is, he went rabbit hunting all weekend.  I guess what I'm saying is, if you want this kind of lifestyle, be ready to have life throw you a whole new set of curveballs.

I am going to be purchasing a house on an acre and cannot wait to begin as much homesteading goodies as possible. My main concern is whether or not this will be enough space for goats.

1. Everyone says 3-5 goats per acre. Is that a single, one-acre pen, or is it 3 small pens to for rotating the goats? 

2. Is it possible for 3 goats to graze in a single acre for 90% of their diet, or will this need to be supplemented with feed?

3. I have heard about various parasites that goats are vulnerable to, what can be done to combat this?

4. We are hoping to raise these goats for dairy (milk, butter, cheese, etc), meat, and if possible, wool/hair. What kinds of goats would you recommend to a newbie that suit these purposes?

5. I have read that a special Cream Separator to make butter from goat milk. Is it even worth it? Where would one go to purchase or how would one construct one of these devices?

6. Goats are escape artists. Does that mean I'll need an 8' tall fence with razor wire at the top? Seriously though, what kinds of fencing do you feel is sufficient?

I believe these are the most pertinent questions at this time. Thanks for your input guys.

I'm a 21 year old college graduate who will be moving to a rural village in St. Lawrence County, NY in a week from now. I've never lived in a rural area (unless you can count summer camp when I was in Middle School) so I'd really like to hear your input on what things I should keep in mind.

I'll be working as a farmer 6 days a week, living in a trailer on the work site for the time being.

If there's anything you think I should know please let me know, and if you have any questions ask away.

Some specific questions I have are:

1. Work clothes, I'm going to be a farmer so I'll be planting, cultivating, weeding, packing, farm repair, irrigating, and working with the tractors. I was planning on going to a goodwill/salvation army store to pick up some clothes for work that I won't have to worry about ruining. I know to get jeans and t-shirts. I was wondering if there was anything else I should buy--a field bib? work gloves? water resistant clothes? Where can I get these clothes? I saw Cabelas had some good prices on their website.

2. Food--My employer is supposed to supply a trip once a week into town to get supplies, but who knows what will be. I will have a working kitchen at the trailer--would you recommend buying in bulk or should I get supplies as needed. I'm used to cooking my own meals, so food preparation should be no problem. I'm also bringing my fishing rod, I can't wait for smoked fish on the weekends!

3. Meeting the people of the town--I've heard that I may be seen as an outsider, not something I'm thrilled about, but to be honest I like my privacy and I can be a bit of an introvert so I don't mind too much. At the same time I don't want to be a loner, it's not healthy for the mind. What would be some good ways to meet people outside of the job? I'd imagine that I could head to the bars or any festivals, but should I stand back at first and observe until people warm up to me? Could I take the initiative to meet people rather than having people come to me?

3. Transportation--I won't have a car with me until I can earn enough cash to afford a truck, insurance, and gas. In the meantime I'll be riding a bicycle to get anywhere I need. That shouldn't be much of a problem right? (I like riding my bike, a lot)

4. And I'm just curious, has anyone passed through Malone, Ogdensburg, or Madrid? What could you tell me about the area?

In order to grow our rabbit population and cut back on our time, we were considering something like a colony-style approach. 

Something where we can either have multiple does (and maybe their kits until weaned) in a tractor (5' x 10' sort of size for probably 3 does) that we can move around on our fields or a permanent enclosure (for 8-10 does) we could break into paddocks to rotate them on (considering something with a ""house"" in the center of a large circle, divided into quarters). The buck would live in his own tractor, since we don't want the does bred immediately after kindling.

I've read plenty on people's experiences in starting something like this, but very rarely see any long term follow up.

Alpacas are very similar to llamas, which sell for about $500 max.

The obvious reason that alpacas are selling so high is that supply can't keep up with demand.

The advanteges to keep an alpaca over a llama are as follows; the animal doesn't spit at you and the fiber can be sold for huge amounts of money.

Well let's say over the next 10 years supply catches up to demand. We all know this will eventually happen as boer goats used to sell for over $100,000 when they were new.

If alpacas dropped to $500 each I'm asuming the fiber would end up dropping in price as this price would make a commercial fiber operation viable.

Also, alpacas aren't much different than a llama and with llamas selling so low I don't understand why alpacas are priced so high.

Alpacas seem like a goldmine if you have the money for startup, but on the other hand, how long are prices going to continue to fall?

I realize I'm probably wrong on atleast some of this, what I'm really looking for is information. It would be nice if someone talked me into or out of alpacas.

[(Original post)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/jinm3/my_new_composting_setup_includes_human_waste/)

My outdoor [toilet](http://i.imgur.com/71Ncf.jpg) consists of a hand made table fitted with a toilet seat with a 20(ish) gallon muck bucket underneath.   

Poo/kitchen scraps go into the bucket and then get covered with a handful or two of sawdust or pine shavings.   (Before you ask, it smells fine, all you smell is the pine shavings/dust(mostly pine dust)). [Here's what it normally looks like](http://i.imgur.com/AqBBI.jpg)

Today I built a new proper compost bin out of 4 used pallets and some vinyl twine and I thought I'd share the process with you guys.

([complete album for those without RES](http://imgur.com/a/rFC0p#vAZ6n))

Stage 2: Prepare the initial Ingredients  
[Bucket of poo / used Mouse cage bedding](http://i.imgur.com/xFeJK.jpg)  
[Poured in the mouse bedding](http://i.imgur.com/1IJXa.jpg)  
[Someone gave me an old rotten bale of hay](http://i.imgur.com/pwR7o.jpg)   
[Couple pitch fork loads into the bin](http://i.imgur.com/FXT4i.jpg)   
[In goes the poo bucket](http://i.imgur.com/dPwKF.jpg)  
The initial ""whiff"" of air here was a bit pungent.   I looked and could not identify any actual poop.   Mostly I just see wet shavings and some paper products I tossed in there recently.      
[Spent 20 minutes weeding my garden/yard and threw that in as a cover material](http://i.imgur.com/YBswa.jpg)     

I'll be adding a couple tubs worth of mice bedding later today and probably some more weeds.  
 
This bin will be on a 3 year cycle.  3 years must pass after adding the last bucket containing human waste.  I'll continue to add yard waste until it's full and as it shrinks.   According to my book the final product will be ~20% of the original mass/volume.   Should take me about a year or two to fill it up.   That bucket contained about 2 months worth of poo and bin is only filled up about 10-15%.  (figure 2-3% once it's composted)  It looks about half full but those weeds/straw will shrink and compact very quickly.   

My timeline/recipes are based off of the [Humanure Handbook](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;cp=9&amp;gs_id=12&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=humanure+handbook&amp;qe=aHVtYW51cmUg&amp;qesig=tRyxY7xElmdFbepqAGhWJw&amp;pkc=AFgZ2tnMrSvStpPSAuOO3iTZYuKWNCRLcXP-W_7Dar0PsLTTrWspXg1Qa0uMvcLkPIrX0AsKamYYBfX6XAd8R8GK37R7BpxoTg&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy&amp;safe=off&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=humanure+&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g5&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=&amp;gs_upl=&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=1a2cc6000ca7d280&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=649) and other online resources.  

Some background on this.   I choose to do this initially out of necessity (I do not have a functional bathroom, at the moment).    Now that I understand how this works I choose not to have a normal toilet again.   

This is entirely too simple, too easy and makes too much sense.   My poo is no longer ""waste"" or trash.  It's a valuable commodity that I can recycle and eventually use to grow food with.   

I will no longer pay money to throw away something that that is valuable and useful to me.

I took 4 pallets home the other day, and ripped them apart. I got enough wood to build a new workbench for myself, and most of a rabbit hutch. I haven't had to buy a single nail because I can just straighten the ones I pull out. The splintered pieces I could burn or do whatever one does with scrap wood.

My parents build gates, fences and chicken tractors out of the pallets they get from their area.

People give away pallets all over the place - you'll never be in short supply if you're diligent - anyone else have any ideas or uses for this amazing resource?

1369689145.0,29,self.homestead,1f5q5s,"A few general questions about starting a homestead, mostly regarding cost and technology",33,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/1f5q5s/a_few_general_questions_about_starting_a/,"Hello. I'd like to start a discussion in order to see if I could possibly stand living out in a rural area; that is, if it's right for me.

A little while ago I came across this website: http://www.simplesolarhomesteading.com. More specifically, I found one of this guy's videos on Youtube. In it, he talks about how he bought some land for under $500, pays under $200 for property taxes, and under $200 for heating each year. He built the house itself for $2000, and the solar system cost about $3000. His house runs on battery power at night, which is enough for a TV and a laptop as well as all the lights and whatever else he has.

This appeals hugely to me because I want my own place and I don't care too much about the size of it. It seems like I could live on very little money as well, which would do wonders for my security.

I realized if I built a house like simplesolar's it would probably cost more. I would want a septic tank instead of a composting toilet, and more complete plumbing. Though I'm not an expert, it looks like his electrical wiring is somewhat dangerous, so I would probably take the time to do mine properly.

There are some problems I see, however. For example, I have a very powerful computer with a 750 watt power supply. I have the feeling that I wouldn't really be able to use it in a small house on solar power. I use it to play games a few times a week, and for a lot of nerdy internet things, which leads me into my next point.

I live with a decently reliable and fast internet connection. I saw the other thread about internet in rural areas, and if I'm right, I suppose I could live out in the country and still get a good connection so long as I don't go too far away from the nearest city or town. The problem I see with that is the cost of the property and living.

Another potential problem with building a house similar to simplesolar's would be heating and cooling. I don't know if a window air conditioner would be too much for the electric system, especially considering I live in Texas. Heating is probably easier.

Anyway, I'm looking for some input and ideas. What can you guys tell me about electricity usage, cost of property, cost of living, and finding a good location? Are there any books I can pick up on this subject?

For a little more background, I'm a relatively young guy (23) living in the suburbs. I've grown to hate the whole ""rat race"" thing and I'm somewhat reluctantly studying so I can get into IT. Building a small solar-powered home sounds appealing but I want to know more before I make a stupid decision.

Thank you very much.",,False,self,t5_2s8lc,False,,,True,t3_1f5q5s,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/1f5q5s/a_few_general_questions_about_starting_a/,

I'll have enough money this month to buy a pretty nice little acre in the country but what can I realistically do with it?

I'll also be dumpster diving a lot for extra food and I'll continue to have decent income even while I'm working/living on this property so even if it doesn't turn out to be ideal, I'll be able to get a lot of practice in home-building and sustainable living, and then upgrade to a bigger/better piece of land.

*[edit]* i dont think i was clear: the island is actually very large, 3rd largest in Fiji and has 9000 permanent residents, but is still remote even by Fiji standards. But we do not own all or most of AN Island, I was just saying that it is ON an island for ecological and climate concerns. 

We want to open a bed and breakfast resort type operation eventually, but also first make a family homestead. I'd like to make a model green/energy efficient/self-sustained organic farm/low labor permaculture type operation, for personal reasons and also since it could attract guests (WWOOFing, etc)

Also, since there is no electricity on the island and getting supplies can be costly it is just prudent. So we would need to come up with our own electricity generation methods anyway. 

Personally I'm into permacultue but I get the feeling that many of the traditional permaculture methods dont apply or would need to be adjusted for Jungle climate.

My in-laws are goat farmers, so we will obviously have goats. And there are some native crops that they are well aware of. And clearly things like solar are always viable.

But I wonder what other unique options are available that traditional farmers here may not utilize? For instance sugar farming is common here, is it possible to turn a small plot of sugar cane into a viable diy biodiesel production (I know next to nothing about bio-fuels).

Or do things like aquaponics or similar techniques make sense here?

The farm (160 acres) is still in the family, shares owned by my mother, uncle and their first cousins. It's still actively farmed, managed by someone in the area, growing wheat and raising some cattle. The farmhouse is rented out, though in serious need of repair due to some particularly bad tenants.

None of the shareholders (except possibly my mother) are interested in moving to the property or taking a more direct role in its management. 

I currently lack the expertise to take over farm operations. And I don't have enough capital to do much in the way of renovation or repair, to start many new projects or to buy the property outright. Since no one else is interested in it, my proposal to the family will be to allow me to move there (displacing the tenant) while they retain the earnings from the farm and mineral rights. I wouldn't make any changes to the farm operation itself unless while there I find the current manager is being negligent.

My background is a combination of programming and education. In the area are several schools in need of teachers so several opportunities for employment there. Programming, not a hot item there though I could switch to information technology, in which case there would be some opportunities. Or freelancing, though I have little experience with that and would prefer a steadier income to begin with. Ideally I'd like to be able to buy the farm from my cousins and uncle once I have enough money. At least my cousins, reduce the split to three people with one in near majority control (I'd own a 50% stake at that point). I'm uncertain of the land's value at this time, but the regional average is $1400/acre so about $112k for their stakes.

So my questions:

1) Any experience with taking over a family owned property like this that has gotten split up through the generations? Have you found people generally accomodating or ...?

2) Any opinion on the income plan? Does teaching leave a single person enough time to develop and maintain a property like this? I particularly like this idea with the summers off to spend on property improvements. Income wise, I'm a frugal person so personal expenses will be low to make up for the cut to my salary.

3) Build or renovate? The house is well over 100 years old at this point. It spent the 90s in a pitiable state of disrepair. To my knowledge, my grandmother and aunts (prior owners, now deceased) made no effort to renovate but left it to the renters. Almost certainly a vermin issue present, roof and siding in a bad way. I have not been inside recently as I'm not the property owner and there have been renters every time I've visited.

While I have been in that home, when I was 2 or 3 before my great-grandmother passed, it holds no sentimental value to me. It's an inefficient home in need of many major repairs.

We're in Georgia, so it'll still be plenty warm enough to get some work done, and one of the first things on our list is clearing the pasture out.  It's not huge (maybe two acres or so for the main part of it), but the place has been abandoned for almost a year, so it is REALLY overgrown.  It's mostly waist-high grass, but there are some woody shrubs and brush in parts of it, too.  We do not have a tractor or bush hog or even a riding mower, just a push mower and weed eater, and we won't have much money for expensive equipment until next year sometime, because the house needs some work too.  

We've considered trying a machete, but neither of us have ever used one, so I don't know how efficient it would be.  The only other thing I can think of, short of borrowing/renting some equipment, is maybe using the weed eater to clear the fenceline so that we can repair it (it's 4' woven wire that needs tightened, plus insulators for a top and bottom hot wire, but the wire is mostly gone or rusted out).

1356125649.0,29,self.homestead,158y52,I asked about rain barrel pressures. The results and a big thanks,31,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/158y52/i_asked_about_rain_barrel_pressures_the_results/,"**TL;DR: I asked a rain barrel question, you answered. Thank you, here’s the result. Look pictures!** 

A few months ago, I posted a question [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/z88n7/will_i_produce_enough_pressure_from_an_elevated_4/) regarding how much pressure I could expect from a raised rain barrel and if it would be enough to adequately water my 250 sqft garden. I received a lot of good information from u/benpope and a civil engineer who seems to have deleted his profile. I’m appreciative of all the help and wanted to give an update on how it’s worked out and a thank You to those who made suggestions. While I can’t directly thank the civil engineer who did the math for me, thanks to u/benpope and others who contributed.

[Here’s the results](http://imgur.com/a/ZM4sc). It turns out I have 3/4"" PVC and it's 160 feet from the rain barrel site to the garden. After much agonizing over the best and easiest means of testing the efficiency of water columns at various heights, as suggested by the civil engineer, I finally settled on the ancient method of “F**k it, let’s build it and see what happens.” I had initially planned to have the barrels side by side and draining from the very bottom but their tops aren’t removable and so I had no way of getting inside to put together a flange. After some internet hunting I found a means of filling and draining that didn’t require cutting them at all. (Though I later opted to cut a fill hole in the very top. It was just simpler and more efficient) The stand is almost an exact copy of one I found [here](http://www.digthedirt.com/contributions/1961-Stacked-rain-barrels), though I did beef up the bracing and used 3/8”x4” lag screws to hold everything together. It’s a veritable brick outhouse and could easily hold a 3rd barrel if I needed it to. It’s quite a bit taller than I had anticipated, with a filled waterline a few inches over 6 feet. 

Once I had it completed, connected to the system I already had in place, and all my leaks and bugs ironed out, it turns out I needn’t have worried about the pressure. It’s well more than enough to give me great flow. Enough to drain one 55 gallon barrel in about 15-20 minutes. You can see from the pictures that I only have one bed set up with the PVC drip system while the rest is still the vinyl stuff. I’ll gradually replace each bed with PVC as money and time allow and those will almost certainly decrease the pressure and flow I have now but since I have more than I need, I think it will be alright. The next step will be to build a system to divert overflow as a good solid rain filled both barrels in about 10 minutes. 

For those interested, the watering system I have is ¾” PVC leading to a ¾” manifold which connects to 6- ½” PVC runners, each with a 1/16” hole drilled every 6 inches. Everything except the mainline and manifold are only friction fitted so that they can be opened to flush out debris or removed all together when I till the beds. Various sources suggested specific hole patterns and spacing for various vegetables but because I rotate crops into differing sized beds I needed a one-size-fits-all approach. The solution seems to be to duct/gorilla tape up the holes I don’t need to conserve water and increase pressure.

Thanks again to everyone that helped and I hope my experience may have helped or inspired someone else here. I’m open to all comments and criticisms of the rain barrel system, my garden, or anything else I mentioned as I know there are plenty of people who have done this a lot longer than I have. Thanks!

1353863060.0,28,self.homestead,13rj8v,Hoping for some discussion regarding our upcoming move.,31,3,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/13rj8v/hoping_for_some_discussion_regarding_our_upcoming/,"My husband and I have been living aboard boats for the past six years, but we're ready for something different.

We're in the process of selling the boat. We started a business five years ago, and my husband is quitting his job and we'll be relying on the business for 100% of our income starting mid-December, so we're free to live wherever we choose. Our families live roughly 8 hours away from each other, so we're trying to find some sort of middle-ground to call home.

There are a lot of things we're trying to sort out. Do we buy land and build? Is it absolutely essential that we get a well? Septic? Electric? I don't care if we have to use an outhouse for the next 20+ years, but we need the Internet for the business, so at least we know that for sure. 

My husband is extremely handy. He's been doing boat projects non-stop for the past six years and will definitely feel the need to be working on a project at all times. How much would it cost to build a simple, small-ish cabin (2-3 rooms)? We have a few architect friends who have a lot of time on their hands and have already offered to come out and help with a building project. 

We have one kid and might have one or two more in the near future, so we have to take that into account.  I'm loving the cabins with stairs leading up to the lofts. Are there good books out there that discuss non-log cabin building on the cheap that you would recommend?

Land is fairly cheap - we can find it for about $1k/acre. How much land do we buy? We dream of gardens, a couple of goats, and enough chickens to have eggs for breakfast. My husband will want to hunt, but we're looking mostly at properties that back up to state land. We'll want to heat with wood, unless my sinuses *still* can't handle it (they never could while living at my parents).

We've been finding a lot of great deals on cabins. What should we really focus on if we end up buying something already built? We both know exactly what to look for in a boat, but cabins are slightly different.

Lastly - our budget is going to be pretty tight. We have a few thousand saved up, and we're hoping to make $10-$25k on the sale of the boat. We don't mind taking out a small-ish loan, but we also don't want to be up to our ears in debt.

Our current plan is to live with family while we make these decisions - at least 6 months but it could end up being longer.

Anyway, hopefully we can get some insight. I am SO excited that we'll be able to do some of the things that we've not been able to do while living on a boat. I can't wait to grow some of my own food, let my dog run free, and teach my daughter about living in the woods. 

Thanks, everyone.

tl;dr: my husband and I want to buy property, but we've been living on boats for over half a decade and we want some insight.


**Edit** Thanks so much everyone. This was incredibly insightful, and has helped us think a lot more realistically about our goals and plans.

My questions is this: What sort of machine should I rent to free up these trees and get on top of the brush?  Should I just leave this to the professionals and contract it out? Any idea on costs? There is a large area that is completely impenetrable (like 15 acres) I was kinda thinking of just hollowing out the center to make a huge deer-free orchard area with a massive hedge around the outside.

At the moment it's brambles, weeds and stumps. It is directly south facing, and looking south the hill slopes up on the right and down on the left. The soil is mainly clay. There are no beds in the main area currently, although there is a small path that we're thinking of digging up which circumnavigates the garden. Overall it is surrounded by 8' fence panels, and the rear/south of the garden backs onto an alleyway and the side of our neighbour's home.

I am planning to live in this house and garden for the next 5-6 years so any improvements should ideally be either portable, cheap or with a decent ROI in this timeframe.

My plan is to prep the garden before the winter and make it ready for planting in the spring. Not entirely sure of the best route on this.

I believe the side beds (since they're often shaded) would be best for leafy greens, beans, peas and herbs. I would like to divide the remaining large square area of the garden like so:

* Roughly 1/4 for a chicken run (I think 3 hens, just for eggs). I'm looking into building something like [this](http://www.organicgardeningfarming.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/A-frame_chicken_coop_Portland_OR.jpg), with a fenced run around. I don't have the acreage for fully free-range, so it'd have to be ad-hoc when I'm in the garden.
* Roughly 1/2 for a crop rotation of potatoes,legumes/roots and leafy greens. I was thinking of three raised beds for this - 1 cinderblock tall with an area of roughly 4'x12', like [so](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_Xcv0VbxbRcc/SjXcECzHSWI/AAAAAAAABFo/9ofdvqiJf_g/s1600-h/IMG_8433%5B3%5D.jpg)
* Roughly 1/4 for a patio area for a rocket stove and some chairs, using either recycled slabs fully or in some combination of recycled woodchips or grasses.

I'd like to use this opportunity as a dry-run while we're in an urban environment so we can transplant this knowledge to the smallholding of our dreams safe in the knowledge we're not complete amateurs.

Please, any advice would be most greatly appreciated.

I've a large heritage house (3000 sq feet) that i've been slowly renovating and retrofitting. When I purchased it, it was without a furnace or a flue and had cheap baseboard heaters installed, which I've yet to replace, and would like to use as little as possible.  I've re-insulated and replaced all windows.  It has a new foundation.  I will very likely close off a few pipeless and unfinished rooms for the winter, reducing the area by ~ 500 sq ft or more, and there'll be a few other rooms that I can live with being cool.  What else?  I was able to afford a metal roof on the back half for now.  Rest will be installed next year, hopefully.  High ceilings on first floor.  Central staircase is quite open.

So, it's essentially a blank slate for heating right now.  Wasn't planning on having it livable by this winter, so my heating budget is ~ $2000.

Have an option to get a deal on a ductless heat pump, installed for around that price.  It's a rather low grade model, though (midea/toshiba, and 18,000 btu, split), so I'm not fully sold.

Open to anything that falls in that budget - unconventional or blatantly obvious - but i'd rather it not be just a temporary fix... heaps of convect air panels? infrared? rocket mass heater? solar air heaters? a combination?

We're a family of 7 so there's tons of water going down the drain every day between bath/showers and laundry.  Meanwhile my ornamental landscaping and my fruit, nut, and shade trees are all dying due to drought.  I would love to expand my landscaping (hedges, more fruit trees, etc) but can't afford the water bill, hence my desire to put in a greywater system.

I live in a small town on a large lot.  My house is on a pier-and-beam foundation so access to the plumbing is no issue.  I'm not overly fussy about permits - I'm OK with bootlegging a system in.

My only restrictions are that it needs to be fairly low-maintenance and not a hassle to use (with 5 kids, my wife doesn't need any more headaches).  I'd prefer something I can put in myself.  I'd be happy with the ability to just irrigate my landscaping and trees, but it doesn't need to be limited to that (e.g., if I could add a sprinkler system for my front lawn, or build a wetland, that would be awesome).

Also, I don't know what the practical restrictions are as far as what soaps and cleaners we can use.

I've spent some time googling this but it's a bit overwhelming for a noob like me.

Could someone point me in the right direction?  What books should I buy?  What sites should I visit?

I'm 30, unmarried and childless. I have spent most of my life in small towns surrounded by cornfields. I hate this area and I want to live out in the country.

 My plan is to continue working here (where the money is good) while living well below my means (studio apartment, no vacations, 10 year old car, etc), until I have enough saved to buy some undeveloped land in central Indiana (20-30k). 

Then I would build a large steel building and rent it out as storage space for RVs and boats, making that my primary source of income (about $1000 a month). I lived in that area for 12 years and I feel there is a market for this.

For power I would use solar with a gas generator for back up. Water would be well or captured from rain. Sewer would be septic, or maybe just an outhouse.

I would live on the land in an RV most of the year, but spend my winters traveling across the southern United States in said RV.

I was also thinking of renting out the land for festivals and group camp outs, if there is a market for that. I have connections in a ""large small town"" nearby, I feel I could start something like an annual music festival. 

This dream keeps me going, but in what ways am I being unrealistic? How can I increase my chances of making is dream a reality? What can I do to prepare in the next two or three years?

Thanks!

Assuming I did the conversions correctly, electricity in my area is about 17x more expensive than natural gas.

So, based on that information, I was wondering if it would be worth it to install a permanent natural gas generator for electricity?

It turns out that the 4.2 acres of ""wet"" land isn't wet at all.  It's flat, fertile, and just needs to be cleared of the brush and grass that occupy it now due to decades of not being used for anything.

The reason why the land was originally thought to be ""wet"" was because it's on a floodplain, and was flooded as recently as 3 years ago.  However, this doesn't happen all the time.  Since records have been kept, I think this land floods due to high river conditions from heavy spring melt or rainfall on the order of maybe once a decade.

So, this got me thinking... I can easily clear this land for pasture and/or cultivation.  If I was to eventually devote, say, a good acre to growing things and the rest to pasture for any animals I might decide to have (horse, goats, etc.), how would I go about actually PLANTING an acre or two of land?  I am keeping in mind that this is definitely an EVENTUALITY... I'm not going to start off too big and fail miserably... obviously this would be something I'd try to grow towards.

However, this line of thinking has led me to wonder about what others on small acreages use for planting.  An acre or two I would think is too large to be thinking about hand sowing, etc.  Is there such thing as a small scale seed planter for the small acreage owner?  I'd appreciate any knowledge and/or tips everyone has!

**tl;dr: If one has an acre or two that they want to garden/cultivate crops on, what options are there for seeding/planting equipment?  I am assuming that this is too large an area for hand sowing, but also so small that it wouldn't be feasible to use any kind of commercial equipment.**",,False,self,t5_2s8lc,False,,,True,t3_1aza73,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/1aza73/what_do_people_on_modest_acreages_use_for/,

We have future plans building our final off grid earth home in the next few years. Right now we want to either start building a wood cabin or a cob house. We both really like the idea of a cob home. We really want to stay away from the traditional stick housing if at all possible. 

The problem is our soil. We live up in the hills just north of Arkansas and it's extremely rocky. The thought of getting a tractor up here, digging up a bunch of soil and trying to sift all the rock out just seems unrealistic to me. You can't even stick a shovel half an inch into the ground. 

I understand [this is roughly what I need](http://weblife.org/cob/cob_043.html). Getting the straw and sand is easy. It's the clay/dirt I'm having he problem with.

It seems the norm for the american dream is take out a loan for college, then take out a mortgage for a giant brand new house, 2 more loans for cars, and then swim in debt for the rest of your life.

This is unacceptable in my eyes and I hope some people on this subreddit can help me. My idea consists around a single thing: minimize debt. I'm in college right now, with a decent ROI for my degree/career. As soon as I leave I want to pay that loan off in full. Then, I would like to buy an empty plot of land(maybe 5 acres) and begin construction on a house. I don't want to buy the whole thing at once, just start off really small. Something a normal person could afford in cash($20-30k) then add on and add on, until I have a full size home. 

If I can figure out how to make this a reality, I think I can avoid a mortgage. So Reddit, how do I search for this home idea? I would like to think it's modular, but I'm not getting the results I want with that search term.

*edit* Also, I am pretty decent at home renovation. My dad taught me everything he knows during my childhood. I am confident in being able to do 75% of it and learning the remaining 25%.

I am soon to be moving from the overpopulated Ontario to my dream homestead on 7 acres in the pacific northwest of British Columbia, near my home town of Terrace.  My property already has a small house on it, which is plumbed, has power, and phone lines.

Now, I need to have a good internet connection out here. I am very much looking forward to a life closer to nature, but I'm not willing to give up all the amenities of living in the modern age (I love me my computer games!).

What options do I have for internet? I've done some research and I understand that satellite is a terrible option for gamers because of the latency.  Obviously there's no cable or DSL available. I know some folks near where I am have some sort of wireless internet, but I have no idea how good that is. I do know that I have 3G out at my property though, because when I was at the property last year I was able to tether my iPhone to my laptop and Skype with my fiance over the webcam so she could see what the place looked like.

My most burning question, though, is what options are available if money is not an issue?  What would it cost to have fiber or something run to my place specifically (if that's even doable) if I was willing to pay the price?

Any help would be MUCH MUCH appreciated... the internet situation is the only thing I need to figure out to be well on my way to living my own personal dream :)

For the past year since we got our property I've been using a push mower around the house (about an acre ... and in Louisiana heat, that's no fun). I'd happily take either, but I DO want to get something we could get more use out of ...

We have about 8 acres of pasture and keep about 20 sheep (10 ewes, the rest are lambs less. They do a good job of keeping it down, but it does need occasional trimming. Our neighbor bush hogged it for us last year and with our sort of soft, heavy clay soil, completely tore up the pasture. I'd like to have the option of using whatever riding mower we get to go out there and do some cutting if I have to.  From what I can tell, the zero turns are faster, but might not do well on some really uneven ground (and it can get pretty bumpy out there). The garden tractor (I think it's a Deere D170 he's looking at) looks like it'd be good, but slow.  I like the idea of using the GT for possibly towing some stuff, but we have a Grizzly 660 four-wheeler we use for most of our towing needs so it's not a requirement. 

Any thoughts? Are zero turns really made for flat, even lawns? Is the speed difference between the two that vast? I'm leaning towards the GT, but since I know nothing about them I thought I'd ask some of you folks which would be good for small pasture maintenance. (I'd love a proper tractor, but that's something we'll have to save up for ... plus I could use something for the acre of lawn around the house anyway.)

Its very low tech.  You need bio-waste and cow dung.  I have seen designs based on 55 gallon steel drums kept a safe distance from the house, with gas lines leading inside.  Water based pressurized tanks can be used for storage and the same safety procedures used with NG or propane are followed.

Ideally, I'd imagine that I could mow my lawn every two weeks, feed the chopped trimmings to the digestor and then output gas to efficient infrared heaters(tankless H2O and stove top) in my home.  I would pick devices that run well with unprocessed gas.  If I run low on homemade methane, I can turn a valve and switch back to NG or Propane.

If you use this method; What is your setup like?  How do you maintain it?  Any advice?

We have a guy we buy chickens from that has offered to help with any emergency we might have - and we did have one this week-end.  Unfortunately he was out of town due to the holiday and we ended up loosing one of our girls.  It was totally preventable and I made a novice mistake (still kicking myself for it).

Anyway, we do have cats, ferrets, and us and I have dealt with a myriad of basic health issues with the 'mammals': fleas, cuts, gastric issues, etc. and the veterinarians in the area are more than happy to take our money to solve not so simple issues.  I do have plenty of basic medicines for the mammals and remedies in our cabinets.

What would be the basic medical emergency supplies for fowl to keep on hand?  Basic antibiotics, pomades, etc..

So I was wondering what would be better? A green roof like I had planned with possibly less water collected each year or a much more expensive metal or other roof and collecting more rainwater? I don't know which way would be best. I do have access to a well on the property (multi-family property) for occasional (emergency) use, but I was really hoping to get all of our water from rainwater collection.

Second, there are some critters in my neighborhood that would like to make short work of any chickens I keep outside (raccoons, cats). How would I go about predator proofing the run.

My super-new husband and I are getting a house this spring. It's a 3 bed, 2 bath on 2 acres of [sloping] land, and I am excited! My only problem is I don't quite know where to start. I don't want to rush in head first and take on all the responsibilities at once, but I definitely want to get the ball rolling.  We're not looking to be totally self-sufficient (yet), but we'd like to build up in that direction. 

Things I am interested in tackling: 

* chickens (egg and meat)

* goats (milk products and meat)

* bees (plant pollination and honey)

* garden (food and seeds; there are lots of gophers there and, as I mentioned, the sloping land)

* fruit trees (food)

* canning/preserving

* worm composting


Now, where to start? I was thinking of planting the fruit trees and getting our chicks first, so they can grow up and mature as quickly as possible. But:

* Where do I go for design plan ideas for the property? Looking for things like pens/pastures, chicken coops and runs, dog runs, bee/tree/garden locations, and stuff of that ilk. 

* How do I got about building pens and pasture for the goats?

* How do I deal with the sloping land? I was thinking of planting grass there and designing two large pens, one for the goats to graze and one to plant hay, where I can switch them off every year. Is this a bad idea on a slope?

* There is a small amount of actual flat space where I was planning on putting the garden. I want raised beds to protect against the darn gophers, and I saw this cool idea of using large metal troughs, but aside from drilling holes into the bottom, how can I make sure there is enough drainage? How do I find out how many beds I need? And do berries (blueberries and raspberries) do well in beds?

* Can I plant an mini-orchard on a slope? How do I protect them from deer? 

* Where/how can I find a butcher who could help me or teach me how to process the goats (and in the future, possibly cows and pigs)? I know how to skin, and I have done a lot of comparative anatomy, taxidermy, and organ removal, but I am at a bit of a loss on how to go about culling and preparing different cuts of meat (hopefully with as little skeletal damage as possible, because bones are cool o.O)

* We will be having children in the not-so-distant future. Is what I am planning so far a little too much work for me to do pretty much by myself while I am raising babies and husband is at work? I know woman have done this for many millennia, but I am concerned since I am a noob at this and haven't been raised into it. 

* Is there anything I am blatantly overlooking?",,False,self,t5_2s8lc,False,,,True,t3_14ot55,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/14ot55/finally_getting_our_house_now_where_to_start/,

Right now I am treading lightly by simply listing the benefits of having more acreage and space to run free, and not having to deal with neighbors.  If I had a video describing how the land is used and tended, and all the benefits of homesteading that would be great.  I understand the importance of fully preparing them for the hard work and dedication that comes with homesteading, but for now I'm just trying to spread the seeds!  :)  Thanks all.

While I have you here I thought I might fire off a couple questions to assist in my research:

1. How many acres is recommended for a budget homestead?  I was thinking 3AC minimum, 5-10AC is better, 20+AC would be great.  

2. How far do most consider acceptable from a smaller city or even regional airport?  Under 2hrs max for airport and 1-1.45hrs for the next major city? 

3. What are some of your favorite sites that specialize in sales of small farms/homesteads?  Looking into Missouri at this time. http://www.landsofmissouri.com/missouri/

Now, I Hate paperwork. I have no intention of burdening our forests with more pointless, redundant, non-applicable paperwork. But it seems as if every breath taken on agricultural property has to be accounted for.

It reminds me of the Vogons in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, who ""wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders - signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as firelighters.""

Location is southeast Michigan. I've got a basic aluminum sided pole barn and currently 2.5 out of 10 acres pastured.

The back of the barn leads into the one of the pastures. I was thinking of making a pen at the back of the barn to provide shelter for the sheep. Here's some pics of the back, try not to be distracted by my sweet ass 5th ave. [Barn](http://i.imgur.com/Mtxrg.jpg) [Barn](http://i.imgur.com/c3rJ0.jpg)

I was thinking of running fencing board or just basic 1x6s from lowes on the outside and a [livestock gate](http://i.imgur.com/53bCG.jpg) in the middle. Here's a [non scale drawing](http://i.imgur.com/53bCG.jpg) of what I was thinking. Red = exterior walls, brown = 6x6 posts that hold the barn up, yellow = 1x6 board, blue = livestock gate with arrow for turn direction. I also considered using a 2nd livestock gate so that I could turn my single pen into 2 if I wanted and have the middle open to access the pasture. 

Those measured gaps shown are from the inside edge of each post. This already presents a problem as the gates I'm seeing are 8' or 10'. It shouldn't be a problem to get the 10' to work in the 9'11"" section. Maybe for the 9'3"" attach a shorter 6x6 to each 6x6? That would leave me with a 8'3"" gap, I could also scrap the dual gate idea for the moment. 

For the fence board, should I run a single 10' piece across or put in a 4x4 post with two 5' boards? I thought going with two boards would be a better route for strength. Mainly because I have kids and kids like to climb wooden fences to look at animals. 

Another issue is that 12' sliding door. That would be their way in/out for the moment. In the summer I could leave it open and get some nice circulation, it would also be inviting for birds. I thought I could put up some of the black garden fabric. Would make it less inviting to birds and keep the circulation. That would be great in the summer, not so much in the winter.

What about cutting a square out of the siding and making a smaller hinged door? I could even reattach the siding to the outside of the door.

I'm also at double risk for losing heat, as if I lose either gas or electric, I have no way to heat the house.

So, my questions are:

Anyone installed a wood burner in their house themselves?
What issues did you have with your insurance company?
Did you or someone else spec the install?
Did you get it inspected so you could prove to ins.co that it was done to code?
who inspected it?

Here's my layout. I have an interior wall in my livingroom that is almost in the dead center of the house. For now, I'm thinking that I'll just remove the carpet, put down some kind of fire block or whatever is necessary. Use a free-standing cast iron or steel wood stove, vented up through the roof. I intend to use necessary heat shield on the wall to reduce the necessary spacing. I'll probably also turn the stove so that it's parallel to the wall, it's kind of on a corner where the hallway leaves the livingroom, so I'll have good spacing and access on the front, and it reduces the distance that the stove sticks out into the room.

My husband and I are looking at a farm that is for sale through owner financing in Montana. It is a really good deal, 10 acres with a 2003 home on it and barns in place. We were told it was a foreclosed property. Well we went out today and we found out why it's such a good deal, it needs a lot of work, which isn't an issue, we can do that. However, the land was originally owned by a man that abused the right of way his neighbor had given him to this landlocked farm. The owner was arrested, his house foreclosed on and since 2009 has been bounced from one company to another. We spoke to the neighbor today and he made it clear that he would not give right of way access to us if we bought the property and told us if we tried to force the issue he would fight it. 

I don't blame the neighbor, the last owner was a real bad egg. However, it is rare to find a property like this for anywhere near the asking price. I miss farming! I grew up on one in New Hampshire and want that life for my children. So, I really want this property, but as I have spent the last few hours reading, I can try to force him to allow us under Montana common law. We'd have to pay him the fair market value of that section of land but we'd get our easement. However it can go either way it seems. I have no experience with real estate and was wondering if maybe someone had any experience with this kind of problem that they could share with me?

Killing the neighbor with kindness is an option too, but I don't think it is going to get me very far. ",,False,self,t5_2s8lc,False,,,True,t3_15m3gw,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/15m3gw/question_about_land_easements_to_farms/,

My wife and I just bought a small little homestead property and it is on well water. Unfortunately it has a sulfur smell to it. Both the hot and cold water have the smell so I doubt it is something inherent in our water heater. Our well room in the garage has a lot of different equipment in it that I am pretty unfamiliar with, and unfortunately no manuals. 

[Here is the well itself](http://i.imgur.com/CVmMd)

[Here is the pressure tank](http://i.imgur.com/eLYmV) I also wonder if this is something I need to periodically recharge.

[So this is our chlorinator](http://i.imgur.com/zV67f) and is the next step after being pumped from the ground and pressurized. It is currently set on ""6"", whatever that means.

[It goes through this particulate filter next.](http://i.imgur.com/oyOy7)

[The filter itself looks like a roll of butchers twine](http://i.imgur.com/0vOdX)

[Next the water flows through a water softener](http://i.imgur.com/5Iy8z)

[And finally into a retention tank before being sent into the house.](http://i.imgur.com/KHkLw)

From what I've read in other forums and websites, the chlorinator and water softener should take care of the sulfur smell problem, but it isn't. Is anyone here familiar with this kind of stuff? Can someone tell me if they were ever able to successfully get rid of the sulfur smell altogether? I wonder if my equipment is working properly. Any help would be greatly appreciated.



Edit:

Sorry it took so long to reply back. It turns out that my system is actually set up in this order: well &gt; pressure tank &gt; chlorinator &gt; retention tank &gt; particulate filter &gt; water softener &gt; house. I'm thinking  that maybe the chlorinator isn't pumping enough of a chlorine mixture into the water as it is only turned up about halfway. I have turned it all the way up and am going to let it run for a few days and see how it does. I think shocking the well is going to be one of my last resorts. I don't even know how I will access it because the hole that the water pipes come out off seems like it is sealed shut with gravel on top of it. I don't know if that is normal or not. If all else fails I think I will break down and pay a company to come out and set things up, and maybe school me a little bit on how to run the system.
