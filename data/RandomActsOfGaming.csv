All I ask is that you upvote this post, and leave me something that makes me laugh!  I'll message you the gift code after the giveaway is over, and I will probably give to how many people entered by 5 PM EST tomorrow.  Remember all this money goes to charity guys.  =)

EDIT: All right guys!  It may take me a while to get them out, but I'll try to get as many as I can for people.  I don't know if I really will give for everyone, I might just give 100 (it takes a while to get all those urls and send them all out!)  Thanks for entering!
Quick thing; I hope it's clear I meant the newest bundle, the Mojam.  I simply said Indie Bundle because that's what I usually call any of the humble bundles.

1357625719.0,471,self.RandomActsOfGaming,166535,[Giveaway] Anything on Steam that's $25 or less.,521,50,512,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/166535/giveaway_anything_on_steam_thats_25_or_less/,"Allow myself to introduce,......myself.

I'm a new moderator for the subreddit here and wanted to introduce myself to the community and figured what better way to do that than a Giveaway?

Originally I thought about making a giveaway for a copy of The Walking Dead on Steam since I enjoyed playing the game so much myself, but then I figured I would give you guys the option of picking up a different game if you already have that.

So pretty much like the Title says, you can pick any single game, or bundle on Steam that you want; as long as it's $25 or less.

I'm not going to make you jump through hoops or anything, so to enter just do these two things.

____________________________________________________

1) **Upvote this post.**

*I receive no Karma for a self text submission, and it's on the sidebar so you are supposed to do it anyway.*

It's just common courtesy.

2) **Make a comment that includes your** 

Steam ID

A number between 1-1000

And which game, or bundle you want.
_____________________________________

And that's it.

Before you pick a number, make sure no one else has already picked that number.

In case of duplicate numbers, the first one that posted will be the winner.

I will use a random number generator to pick the number and upload the video for all to see.

I do however reserve the right as per Rule 3 to disqualify someone who has a newer account that I suspect to just be using alternate accounts.

If this happens then I will have the generator pick another number.

The winner will be announced sometime after 48 hours has passed.

**I obviously can't enforce this in any way, but out of appreciation I ask that if you win, please provide some sort of proof to the community in gratitude.**

A screen shot uploaded to imgur, or something of that nature to show that the Giveaway is legit. 

I'll edit the text at the bottom of the post here to include that information if I receive anything.

Well, that's it.

Good luck!

I have a copy of Borderlands 2 from my Nvidia card which I don't want, since I already have the game and all of my friends are 360 players (heathens).

Anyway, I'll give it away here.

The Giveaway will be open until:
**19-Dec-2012 @ 10:00 GMT**

at which point I will pm the code to the lucky winner.

I will be using RedditRaffle to choose the winner as well.

Rules:

* **No accounts &lt; 6 months old.**
* It would be nice if you put the text 'Entering' in your post somewhere.
* Upvoting the thread would also be a nice gesture.

Thanks!

**EDIT:**
Sorry that some people aren't happy with the 6 month rule, it's pretty common where I normally give stuff away, and given the first 3-4 posts were from accounts &lt; 1 week old, I think that it's working as intended.  For the other one, It will allow for accounts &lt; 6months with high post counts to try and make things fit reddit a bit better.

I'm also planning a second give away later in the week (maybe thursday or so, which will be similar, but bigger and with an interesting twist).  The other giveaway will have better chance of winning something as well.

**EDIT (2)**
Contest is now closed.

EDIT: The winning combination was Wombat Rapier so u/mikethehero was the only one with the correct response. He has been contacted. Thanks to everyone for the huge participation!

DOUBLE EDIT: Since there were so many entries(no doubt duplicates) I have decided to give away another copy of the game. I will pick another winner using the same criteria but if you want to be considered, edit your post with the word ""Enter"" but make sure to keep your original text(do not change your animal weapon). I will pick tomorrow at noon.

TRIPLE EDIT: Thanks to all of you diligent folks who entered and reentered again, you had a really good shot at winning this time. The 2nd winner is u/Halaku!

1 month ago, I did a [giveaway](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/15x2mb/giveawaysteam_do_you_want_a_game_tell_me_which/), and 5 people won the game of their choice. I did [another one](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/172q5k/giveawaysteam_pick_a_game_and_ill_buy_it_for_you/) two weeks ago, and then 8 people won.

I've made 13 redditors happy, and you are most likely not one of them. But don't worry, cause I'm about to fix that!

Just pick a game and a number between 1 and 2000 (make sure the number is unique), and wait for the giveaway to end.

I'll pick as many winners as I can, depending on the amount of money I have left.


Good luck!

**EDIT:  Questions**

* from hockal00gyvia  /r/gaming/  sent 2 minutes ago
 Also, what about people without a Facebook?

**Answer:**
There is a link to follow us on the front page of our website. Put your email address and mark yourself as a follower, and you will be added to the drawing.

* How will you be able to check if we liked your page AND commented on here?

**Answer:**
When we pick the winner and announce on Facebook youll email dontcritme@gmail.com, we'll ask what your Reddit ID is privately, and once we have that info we'll message you here on Reddit to confirm and check the list of comments. Its a little bit of work, but it's fine considering this makes it fair so that someone that actually did everything we asked actually wins.

* Can you even do this? Isn't this just exploiting us to get more people to like your page?

**Answer:**
1.  We don't make any money from this. 2. You get free stuff for checking us out and sticking around 3. I do giveaways like this all the time, and currently running a charity drive for donating to Save the Children. Read the ""Road to 100"" tab on the blog page :) We do this because we love what we do, not because someone pays us, but we are gamers to the core fibers of our body! If this is exploitation, then count me as guilty :)

* Yeah Id love to sign up, but if you are announcing the winners on Facebook, how can the people without facebook win, I don't have one, I know we can follow you on the website but how will we know if we win?


**Answer: **
When you follow us, it privately sends a message and puts you on our Followers list on our Admin blog interface. It contains your email address you used, so if you are drawn we send you an email :)

I have one download code each for the games mentioned. All are Steam except for Crysis, which is Origin. To enter, please comment with a random number like so:

* 1000-1999 for Crysis 3
* 2000-2999 for Devil May Cry
* 3000-3999 for BioShock Infinite
* 4000-4999 for Tomb Raider

You can enter for all four games if you like (same comment please), but only once per game. On Monday, April 22 at 3:00p Pacific Time, I will pick a random number in each category, and the winner will be whoever is closest. In the event two people are equally close, I'll message them both and do another random number between 1-100.

It's possible I may get second codes for Crysis and DMC.

Public Service Announcement: Consider Nathan Fillion's page on the Clean Water Charity (not required to participate in the giveaway) http://my.charitywater.org/nathan-fillion

EDIT 1 - 19 April @ 6:05 PDT: I'm not going to extend the number ranges due to this being a ""whoever is closest"" selection. If two people somehow claim the same winning number, I'll go with whoever had it first based on comment time. I may end this earlier on Monday if the numbers dry up.

I appreciate everyone's nice comments.

",.,False,,t5_2t5mo,1366755010.0,Steam,,True,t3_1covrh,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1covrh/giveaway_crysis_3_devil_may_cry_bioshock_infinite/,
1363738634.0,243,self.RandomActsOfGaming,1amp0x,"[GIVEAWAY] Any game of your choice. Under $70. Physical, or steam.",269,26,305,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1amp0x/giveaway_any_game_of_your_choice_under_70/,"So here's the story. I quit smoking in August of 2011 after being a constant smoker for almost 19 years. Cold turkey. Done. Since then, I've been putting my cigarette money away, and mostly using it for savings, and for my own purpose. I have, at one time or another, randomly purchased groceries for someone while out doing my own grocery shopping.  

Anyways, this giveaway is for something different. I believe video games are a much better habit than smoking. I'm using my former cigarette money to make someones gaming day.  My father was recently diagnosed with Single Cell Lung Cancer.  While it sucks, paying it forward has its rewards. So the money I did use to purchase cigarettes, for this week, will go to buying one lucky person a game of their choice.

Here's the fine print.  

1) It has to be a game I can easily locate.  I'm not flying to Japan to find the original Final Fantasy 3. Also make it under $70 in American Dollars. 

2) In the thread, introduce yourself.  Tell me why you want/NEED this reward. 

3) On Saturday night, I'll choose a winner and send said game out within the next few days. The winner will be by my choice, but it will be based off the responses I receive and community opinion.

If there's anything you'd rather not share with the world of reddit, feel free to message me directly. 

Good luck, I'll be checking this thread again Saturday night.

***EDIT:*** Making my first edit due to the overwhelming response this has had. Thank you all, for the warm wishes and kind thoughts. I know some of you have messaged me, or commented here saying I'm a good person and that you don't want a game. That means more to me than you'll ever know.  

There has been comments about the price.  The price I am paying for the game is nothing compared to how much I've saved from quitting smoking, as it is the cost I used to pay for cigarettes. 

The true reason I am doing this is simple.  My Father is a great man. A man nobody knows because he wasn't important to anyone other than us. The only things he'll be remembered for is 1) Working his fucking ass off. 2) Loving my mother. 3) Raising 3 amazing kids who are taking on the fight and standing tall with him.  I am not going to spend any less time with him because of this giveaway.  I'm not going to break the bank. He's not going to miss treatments because of this.

I have, for the past 6 weeks typed out posts to reddit along the lines of ""How do you cope when a loved one is given a death sentence"" but delete them out of sheer frustration.  This right here.  Is how I can help pay it forward.  I'm doing something good in the name of my Father.  And, I have a chance to give a little back to the community that has helped me get through my days.

If you don't want a game, I appreciate that. But upvote or comment on for someone you think does deserve it.  It'll help me out a ton. 

***EDIT 2:*** I will amend the shipping date for Bioshock Infinite, if that's what the winner prefers.

***EDIT 3:*** I didn't expect as much feedback as I've gotten, and positive responses.  I'm going to choose the winner Sunday instead of Saturday.  My Mother was informed this morning a previous co-worker of hers has passed, and she has a funeral to attend, so I'm hanging with Pops all day Saturday.

I promise I will read all responses again.  I can't help but reply to some of the posts/comments I've received. You all are warming my heart more than you can imagine.  I will be doing another giveaway in the near future after this one, due to the overwhelming response.  But we'll make that one a little happier.

***EDIT 4:*** Thanks for all your responses so far. I'm slowly going through them.  What this further backs up is the fact that you all, are wonderful people. When I initially started this giveaway, I didn't expect such personal stories.  Some of the feels I got from y'all. Wow. I wish I could do more, but I can only do what I can. Some people, I've even been kind enough to buy some cheaper games for. I've asked those people to post too. 

I'm sorry if I can't buy y'all games. But I'm sure everyone will understand.  It's amazing how the power of gaming can bring everyone together. Also, to top off this awesome week, http://www.finalfantasyxhd.com/


***FINAL EDIT - 5:*** I have chosen the person that I'm going to fulfill their request. There were a ton of stories here that have really touched me, and I'm going to ensure I never delete this giveaway post so I can go back and read them.   It started with a small post offering a game, and then it grew from there. I didn't intend for it to tug at the heart strings as much as it did. 

I was at my parents earlier today, and my Father and I read through some of the posts. You're all amazing people.  I'm just sad I don't have the funds to make everyone's day.

I'll probably do another giveaway shortly, with a smaller limit.  Please be on the lookout for that.  If any of you would like to add me on Steam, or XBox live or PSN, please feel free to send me a message.

I'm not posting the winner's name or story.  But, I will that when they receive their item, they will post a follow-up.

Thank you all again, from the deepest trenches of my heart.",.,True,,t5_2t5mo,1364166003.0,Other,,True,t3_1amp0x,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1amp0x/giveaway_any_game_of_your_choice_under_70/,

Ok, here's the thing, I'm giving away a copy of Halo 4 on my youtube channel, here's the video for that:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbDhf9Fk3XI

The video is messed up, but I realized it after comments were made, so I'm not redoing it. That contest ends on the Feb 23 at 11:59PM

However, I know I can't request people subscribe to my channel by putting it here, so I'm doing this other giveaway. This one will be done here, no subscribes required :) 

$25 for a game on steam. I'm not too stingy about that, but please don't be ridiculous and ask double.  Just post a comment saying anything and you'll have a chance at winning.

EDIT* I'll be honest, I didn't expect this to do as well as it did so quickly.  I'm CONSIDERING bringing the contest date closer.  Would that be unethical?  I just don't know, post and let me know what you think.  

EDIT* You're not required to but if this contest and my Youtube one do well, I'll be more than happy to have more contests. So if you wanna get something in the future, rate, comment, subscribe, like and upvote :)

EDIT* I'm going to get your game at the cheapest source possible (excluding grey market keys) if it will make a good enough difference, so that if I pay something like $10 for your game, you are entitled to another game worth about $15. 

Edit* Someone showed me http://www.redditraffle.com
That works great. Thanks guys. 

Edit*  Even though the contest isn't over yet, I just want to say thanks to everyone involved.  I think I'm going to do this again in the near future.  I'll probably do it the same, a Youtube contest and another one here to advertise it.

Just post here if you want a game. I have plenty of spare Steam and Desura codes. If you have any requests, post them, otherwise I'll give you a random code. Please post your Steam ID so that I can make sure not to give you something you already have.

List of games I will offer: [here](http://www.pastebin.com/mUZUftaX).

A few quick ground rules:

* Minimum account age of 30 days
* Minimum 50 karma
* Can't only post here

tl;dr: Post a joke and a game request or Steam ID. I will give away games in roughly 24 hours.

EDIT: OK, I had an inkling that this would be popular, but not THIS popular. I won't be buying any new games for this - only giving away what I already have. I'll be assigning the games in this order: requests from the list first, then letting me pick (both requests I can't fill and no preference). Within those groups, it'll be in a random order. If I run out before I get to your post, I'm sorry, but I will try to make as many people as I can happy. 

EDIT 2: OK, closing it for entries now. Yes, I know I said 24 hours, and I only left it open for 16, but if I don't close it now, there's no chance I'll ever manage to sort the whole lot out.

EDIT 3: I've delivered a few codes, and will be delivering more over the next few days. I AM NOT ACCEPTING ANY MORE ENTRIES.

EDIT 4: OK, I've pushed out the first 64 codes. Like I said, it'll be a couple of days to finish this. Just because you haven't recieved anything yet, doesn't mean you won't...

Over the next couple days we over at Unity Gaming Network, JC(Me) &amp; Giving Gamers have started a 48+ Hour Giveaway Marathon to try and give back to the amazing gaming community and those over on twitch and reddit who helped SpeedDemosArchive.com raise over 450k for cancer prevention.

Some of the games I will be playing on and off a lot are Chivalry, Dark Souls as well as TF2, Amnesia (First time playing), and many others (Viewers Choice?). We will also be giving away several copies of each of these games throughout the stream. We're doing giveaways based on how many people show up to the stream so the more people the more stuff we can give out.

I also have an NVIDIA GTX460 and two GTX550Ti's to giveaway as well but we need your help and support in getting the word out for this otherwise it might end up being canceled or at set back.

I really hope to see some of you there, and good luck with the prizes if you do stop by! You don't have to do anything to win except be in the stream. The people most active in chat will have a better chance at winning. I don't even want you to follow me unless you genuinely enjoy the stream and what I'm trying to do :)

Stream - http://www.twitch.tv/unitygn

For those only interested in winning something here, I will be giving away a few copies of Chivalry and maybe more/something else depending on how this thread turns out.

What To Do To Win Here?:
1) Please upvote this post.
I receive no Karma for a self text submission, and it's on the sidebar so you are supposed to do it anyway. It's just common courtesy.
2) Make a comment that includes your
Steam ID
A number between 1-1000
And which game you're interested in.*
And that's it.

I will use a random number generator (random.org) to pick the winner(s) and it will be done live and recorded so you can watch it happen if so desired.

**Please help spread the word about this if you like what I'm trying to do. The more people the more things I'll be able to giveaway!**

**Original post:**

Hey reddit!

I've done a [few](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/rkxl1/i_got_a_little_raise_today_reddit_to_celebrate_im/) [giveaways](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/usrnd/doing_a_steam_giveaway_today_reddit_give_it_a_shot/) [before](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/y6ia9/doing_a_30_steam_giveaway_for_no_apparent_reason/) and they were all on /r/Steam so here's one in the right sub for once.

**How will this work?**

1. Pick a fictional character - this could be someone in a movie, TV series, book or comic. As an example (and yes, you can rule out the example as an entry), Austin Powers is a valid entry, but Mike Myers is not.


2. Post your choice as a reply to to this post along with the game you want and its price on steam. **Entries without a price will not be considered.** You can post a price in your local currency too and I'll convert, but please don't leave it blank.


3. I'll get back to this thread **roughly 24 hours from now** with my own list of fictional characters randomly off the top of my head.


4. I'll work down my list and start picking winners. **You win if you've chosen the same fictional character as me, before anyone else has**. In case of a tie, the cheaper game wins. In case of a tie on price too, you will fight to the death. 


5. I'll keep picking winners till the collective total of games picked by the winners reaches $100.


**That was a shitty explanation. Can you give me an example?**

Assume my list of characters is - Xyz, Abc, Def, Qwe, Rty. I'll look to see if anyone guessed Xyz. If yes, I'll pick them as a winner and if their game costs $100, there will be no more winners picked since the $100 pool is exhausted. If their game costs $20, then I'll find a second winner who can pick a game for up to $80 (since my limit is $100 today). I'll do this by going down my list and looking for Abc. Now, maybe the person who picked Abc chose a $30 game. This leaves $50 in the collective pot. I'll repeat this till there's no money in the pool left.


**Am I an a--hole if I pick a really expensive game?**


Ideally, we'd all want people to pick cheaper games so more could win, but I don't want to enforce a limit. This is because sometimes people really want a $60 game and can't afford it, so giveaways like this are their only shot. So you can pick whatever game you want and there's no rule on the maximum price. In short, no - you are not an a--hole if you pick a really expensive game. Not to me, anyway.



**I still have questions. Can I ask them in this thread?**


To make sure I don't accidentally see any entries here, if you have any questions or clarifications you can send me a message in private. I won't be seeing this thread again till it's time to find the winners.


Good luck, reddit!",,True,,t5_2t5mo,1360331165.0,,,True,t3_1827yp,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1827yp/giveawaysteam_any_game_you_want_from_a_collective/,

So this is how this is going to work. **On 1/10/13 at 4 pm Eastern time** I will announce the winner. To enter the contest just follow the steps below.

* Post a comment just acknowledging you are entering. Include a number from 1-1250.
* To allow more people to have a chance at this, upvote this, even the sidebar wants you to!
* Don't submit more then once! I will check.
* (Optional) Maybe share a story about gaming? Something you found awesome, or moving. The story doesn't even have to be about gaming! You can make up the story if you want. I just need something to entertain me while I read through the comments. (This won't increase your chances of winning, since I will be using a website to randomly generate the number I pick)
* You don't have to include your steam ID if it invade your privacy. But if you want to that would be fine. I will be replying to the winner anyway. 
* Show respect for other entering! Don't go through downvoting everything to ""increase your chances"". I am using a random number generator. It won't help you. Just be kind to others.

My second give-away in RandomActsOfGaming, but I'm going to try and do things slightly differently...

**The Prize**

I have a secret budget (&gt;$100), which I will spend on steam to buy you one game of your choice.  I will then choose another winner, and they will get to choose a game of their choice, and so on until all of the money is exhausted (and/or I'm broke).
I will not buy any stupidly expensive games (more than £40 or so) so as to make the deal the best for the most people.

So, when you are choosing, you are reducing the pool for the overall group of winners.  The cheaper the games you choose; the more people who will win overall.

**I will publish the entire list of who chose what (and how expensive it was) at the end of the competition.**

How community minded are you?


**Timeline**

I will pick winners on **THURSDAY 20th DECEMBER at 21:00 GMT**.  It make take a few days to get through all of the winners, so hold tight for a while after it finishes - you might be next in line... :)


**Entry Criteria:**

**You must be one of:**

* Reddit account is &gt; 6 months old
* OR
* Reddit account has &gt; 200 link karma

**AND** You must also:

Your post must include valid English paragraph that contains **all** of the following words/phrases:

* Banana
* Astronaut
* Queen Elizabeth the Second.

(It is RANDOM acts of Gaming, right! :P )

Good Luck.

**EDIT: Because of the steam sale - I've brought this forward a little to help.. :)**

**EDIT2: I'm picking winners now, expect Private Messages to be sent to you to ask what you want... **

1374437667.0,147,self.RandomActsOfGaming,1irmgs,[Giveaway] Steam keys for leftover games from Humble Bundle 8 and Android 5 (14 winners),163,16,155,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1irmgs/giveaway_steam_keys_for_leftover_games_from/,"I've been holding onto these keys for a while and planning to give them away some time in the future, but seeing as there's an influx of Just Cause giveaways, I thought it'd be nice to throw in some variety to the mix. :)

As the title states, I've got keys from Humble Bundle 8 and Android 5 leftover (games I didn't want, already owned, or haven't yet given away):

* Awesomenauts + Awesomenauts Cluck Costume - /u/SilentCastHD
* Beat Hazard Ultra - /u/yonoober
* Capsized - /u/kittensaretasty
* Crayon Physics Deluxe - /u/thejakemc1
* Dynamite Jack - /u/fartloud
* Hotline Miami - /u/ryn98
* Intrusion 2 - /u/EnderPig
* Little Inferno - /u/Ownt_
* Oil Rush - /u/mstrchulda
* Solar 2 - /u/Flat_corp
* Splice - /u/PIX1138
* Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP - /u/alonweiss
* Super Hexagon - /u/Mortenlotte
* Tiny and Big in Grandma's Leftovers - /u/morroblivion

Edit: /u/morroblivion pointed out I made a typo, it should be Grandpa's Leftovers, not Grandma's. For the sake of continuity and ease, please just leave the typo as is and use Grandma's.

**How to enter:**

1. Please select your top 2 or 3 choices and type out the **full name** as I have it listed above. (You'll receive whichever one is available)
2. Please include a link to your Steam ID.
3. I'd also appreciate it if you upvoted my post (self-post, no karma) but that's by no means a requirement.

To be considered a valid entry, you must have completed 1 and 2 above, and also:

* Have a Reddit account that is at least 60 days old
* Have at least 150 cumulative karma
* Be active in more than just giveaway subs

Edit: In case people are unsure as to how to find their Steam IDs:

&gt; On the Steam website, at the top between community and about is your username. Mouseover it, and a dropdown menu will appear. Click Profile and that's the link you should provide

I'll select a winner in approximately 24 hours, so around 1 PM PST on Monday. Winners will be chosen using RedditRaffle.

Good luck to all!

I'm going to keep it simple. I will use random.org to generate a number between 1 and the number of post in this thread. The winner will be able to pick **any game** he/she desire on Steam. Collection packs are fine, just to make it clear. (Just to make sure before someone starts trolling, Railworks 3 packs are fine but you won't get the 1000$ DLCs!). The draw will end on Friday when I come back from work (Around 6PM EST).

My only hope is that the winner actually play the game he will win.

In order to help me, please post once and make sure your reply contains the following: Steam ID Link - Game

Example: http://steamcommunity.com/id/MoneyHypeMike - Shoot Many Robot

Also, feel free to join my [Steam Group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/freestuff4u) in order to win more games. I hosted many giveaways in the past month and will keep doing so because gifting is awesome. I have also challenged the member to reach 10 000 member by the end of the Steam Summer Sale and will reward them with a special giveaway of over **140 games** that keeps growing each day.

Also feel free to visit [SteamGifts](http://www.steamgifts.com/) in order to have a chance to win free games.

**Edit: You are not required to post a number. Make sure to include your Steam ID or something so I can reach you if you win.**

**Edit 2: I will be streaming the random pick on [twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/moneyhypemike) at around 7PM.**

**Edit 3: Winner: Post #386 - cause_im_azn - quantum conundrum**

**Edit 4: I had spare Steam Wallet/copies of games, so everyone active in the stream chat got a game.**

I'm giving away the following games:

* Orcs Must Die

To enter for a chance to win one, check out this page:

EDIT: Just to clarify, it doesn't have to be 23.53 in any currency. Use the current exchange rate to change the £ into your currency :)


EDIT 2: If i pick a number that multiple people have chosen I will narrow the competition down to those people and get them to pick a number. Then i'll gen another number until one of their numbers come up.

Took a whole lot of time. I got more responses than anticipated. Thanks for all the responses. Ive made my decision ill pm them in a bit. Thanks all.

Somewhat long story. Sorry for the sappy stuff I needed to vent.

Gaming to me has always been my escape when I was a child. Mario 3 then it became Starcraft 1. Ive played so many different games into my teens. Gaming sheltered me from a drug abusing mother and a father who worked so much to keep us from living on the street and was never there.

I moved from gaming being my shelter from reality to smoking ciggs and heavy drugs/alcohol. Humping anything that walked. Also just being a terrible downright piece of shit. 

I quit drugs about 5 years ago in March and quit smoking ciggs 2 years ago in June. What got me out of all of that was gaming. It became my go to when stress arised. Although my grandfather has cancer and is about to pass away any day now. I still am going to games even though the temptation is there to return to my past.  I went and saw him today all he had to really say was he was happy for me and proud and to just try to make others smile as often as possible and to just be there for your fellow human. My grandpa was a pivital person in my life who always took me fishing and tried to learn how to play starcraft 1 to which he kinda got good with churning out zerglings fast.he was the only man who was there for me when I needed it most.  

So thats what im doing right now. I want to give away Bioshock Infinite. I giving it away as a thankyou to gaming for helping me and also in hopes to put a smile on someones face.

All I ask is how has gaming affected you in a positive way? What game was it? Or just a good story of your life and how it changed you. 

Ill pm the winner some time tomorrow night. Thanks for your time.

So basically I just won a draw. I feel a slight bit needy now, although I am not a wealthy man, I do offer a gift to gamers. It isn't much, but any game worth roughly $10-$15 I'll have gifted to you, just post a comment and I'll be sure to read all of them, and pick which I suits best :)
Good Luck :D

So yeah, choose a number between 1-1000 and post it below! I will choose one winner sometime tomorrow, the 16th. (Tomorrow is my real life birthday so it may not be till late) The winner will receive the game (or games) of his or her choice up to a limit of $10!

And while it won't affect your chances, feel free to post anything awesome with your comment!

EDIT: I'll gladly wait till the end of the sale if you suspect your game of choice will drop below $10
Good luck!

EDIT2: Like I said, this will most likely go until later this evening (when this post is about 24 hrs old). However if by some freak chance the number of entries hits 1000, I will stop accepting entries then and just pick a winner at that time.


-----------------------------------
Ok guys, today has been a great day for me and I just closed the contest! I'll report back when I choose the winner (in like 10 minutes).

1367926765.0,125,self.RandomActsOfGaming,1dutxw,[Giveaway] Any steam game of your choice valued at $100 or under,138,13,359,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1dutxw/giveaway_any_steam_game_of_your_choice_valued_at/,"After my Bioshock Infinite contest where I thought that for some reason it would be a good idea for people to find me the cheapest place to buy my guitar, I figured that I should give something back to your awesome community and give the several people who wasted hours of their lives for no reward to have another chance. Instead of serenading you all with my new purchase, hopefully this giveaway makes up for it.

Up on offer is any 1 steam game of your choice under USD $100, which you can PM me with afterwards if you are the winner.

The much simpler contest rule this time is: I want you to tell me what you think the most **underrated** game of all time is. You can provide the name of the game and a brief description of why, although it is not an absolute necessity. Although very doubtful, if anyone manages to have the same answer as me, they will be strongly considered. The only clue I will give is that I love older games, ie NES, SNES, DOS, etc. If no one's answer is anywhere near mine, anyone can definitely win!

Only condition is that your reddit or steam account must be at least 1 month old. Good luck!

*Edit: Ends 10pm 9/5/2013 AEST*

*Edit 2: Argh, 1 hour in and there are already such great old and new games that I have forgotten about. As such, I will also have 3 runner up prizes: Torchlight, Bit Trip Runner and Poker Night at the Inventory.*

*Last Edit (I hope :P): If the trade value of the winner's chosen game is much lower than its current steam price (ie. Bioshock Infinite), give me a few hours after the auction is over to trade for it. Just seems illogical otherwise to pay more than it is worth*

**Contest is finished. Thank you to all that entered.**
I had a shortlist of 3 games where the first person to mention either of them would win. Unfortunately... none were mentioned :P For anyone who was wondering, they were: Tyrian (DOS), Leisure Suit Larry 7: Love For Sail (PC), Uniracers/Unirally (SNES). Chrono Trigger is my favourite game ever, but it is obviously by no means underrated.

Minor Prizes - (PM me if you are unhappy with the prize that I have chosen for you. If 2 people would rather each other's games, can easily swap them around)

/u/ecksit1 - Kirby's Adventure (NES) - By far the standout NES game in my opinion. Also where I got my username from! You win Torchlight.

/u/Kindredspirits - Raptor (DOS) - The closest thing to Tyrian. Spent countless hours on the shareware version when I was a kid. You win Bit Trip Runner.  *game sent*

/u/RedGrobo - Rock 'N Roll Racing (SNES) - Was the first person to mention it. Bonus points for anything with Black Sabbath in the soundtrack :). For its time, was amazing. You win Poker Night. *game sent*

**Major Prize**
I mentioned that if the underrated games which I was thinking of weren't mentioned, the winner didn't necessarily have to mention an older game.

**/u/damonx99 - To The Moon (PC)** - Great write up and I completely agree. More of a story than a straight up game, but a very emotional experience. Everyone seriously has to pick it up when its on sale on Steam. You were the only person to bring it up. You win buddy, congratulations.   *game sent*

Will be sending PMs to the winners. Thank you all for the great write ups and recommendations and I'm sorry that I could not give something to all of you for your efforts. I am going to bed in a couple of hours, so if I am not able to talk to the winners today, I'll be on after work tomorrow.

I have grown accustomed to a much more sour tone and experience on Reddit and it was an extremely nice change to see people responding so kindly for a such a simple thing.   

Since you all made my day I want to make the day of a few more gamers. I'll be giving away 5 $10 (or less) games on steam and the choice is up to the 5 winners.  

Please only submit if you can't afford it. I'm new to this sub, so feel free to point out better ways to do things. I'll go with what I saw in another thread. Only accounts over 2 months old. Guess a number between 1 and 1000 and I will choose the 5 closest with a random number generator. 

tl;dr - You are all awesome. There will be 5 winners, each winner gets a $10 game of his/her choice on steam.

Edit:  gamerexq pointed out that posting your Steam ID might speed things up. It's up to you. I don't mind doing a back and forth with messages later if you don't want your ID posted for some reason.   

You can post your game of choice now or wait for the winners to be chosen. It all depends on how long you can wait. :) 

Edit 2: Ho Lee Fuk! I can't keep up with you guys! You're all badass people! Thanks for being cool! I'll try to catch up.

Edit 3: GOD DAMN guys! I'm falling further and further behind. If you want to message or add me on steam, it's at http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035798098/ 

EDIT 4: It sucks that only 5 people get to win, so I'M GOING TO TRIPLE THE NUMBER OF WINNERS! 15 winners will be chosen! Each winner will still be able to select a $10 game or $10 worth of games. I've given as many upvotes as I can give in this period of time and it seems that I've almost caught up. Thanks again for being excellent human beings!

Edit 5: Someone mentioned that I didn't post a time limit. I meant to limit it to the shortest duration allowed here (12 hours), but that falls right in line with sleep time. I work 15 hour days, so I'm afraid I can't sacrifice that time, even for you awesome people. The cutoff will be at 04:00 Mountain time (UTC -07:00) July 20. 

Final Edit: The numbers have been chosen (by a random number generator) and all entries are cut off from this point forward. I'll be sorting through all the responses over the next little while to find the winners! Thank you very much to everyone who commented with something nice to say and thank you for taking part! I'll still be trying to catch up to all the responses and I'll finish upvoting everyone in this thread when I get the chance.

Come chat, play, lurk...you may just enjoy it. Live @ 7:30PM EST!",148,27,136,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1afnh0/giveaway_ugns_4th_giveaway_extra_life_36h_charity/,"**Link to stream below.**

Over the past year and a half I have been giving away games that I want to support on my stream(s). The last one was a week ago and ended up hitting the front page because of a comment I made and I was NOT prepared for that. However I got through the carnage and never gave up and now I'm back to continue what I started with Giveaway Weekend Part 2. So many games and giveaway money were donated that I never had the chance to give away not even counting the various games I already planned on giving away such as Bioshock Infinite, Borderlands 2, X-Com, Chivalry and many, many more.

The main difference between last weekend is the charity event for Extra-Life that we recently started and in only a few hours raised $278 and are Rank 8 so far out of the ~600 or so events this year. Keep it going guys! It's all handled through the website so I never have to deal with the money and it's all Tax Deductible.

During the stream I will be playing a lot of War Thunder (Incredible F2P game that deserves WAY more attention), Dark Souls, Runner 2, Path of Exile, maybe Mark of the Ninja and probably some others as well. I often let the chat choose what I play every so often. 

I also interact with everyone in chat as much as I can including playing games with them because that's the whole point of streaming. Meeting people from all over the world and coming together over a common interest no matter how different your lives may be. It's a pretty awesome thing to be able to do.

We will be giving copies away all throughout the stream at different time intervals depending on how many viewers we currently have. The more people in stream the more that will be given away. I was thinking somewhere along the lines of if we have 100-200 viewers then we would do a new giveaway of at least one game every 1-2 hours. I will fine tune this once we see how this weekend goes and after some feedback from you all.

I also still have a GTX550Ti to giveaway as well but **we need your help and support** in spreading the word about the Charity and Giveaway marathon. The more people we have active the better it gets for me, you guys, and all the kids at the All Children's Hospial we're supporting.

I really hope to see some of you there! To those of you who may have joined last week I apologize for any drama you may have witnessed. Those who caused it are gone, and chat is back to it's normal chilled out self. 

So good luck with the prizes if you do stop by and thank's for giving the stream a shot! Usually you don't have to do anything to win other than be in the stream. The people most active in chat (I log everything) will usually have a better chance at winning. I don't even want you to follow me unless you genuinely enjoy the stream and what I'm trying to do. 

This time around I will most likely do giveaways for some of the bigger/more expensive games for those who donate to the charity but I will likely continue doing the majority of the giveaways as I have always done.

Stream - http://www.twitch.tv/unitygn (I make no money streaming so feel free to leave on ad block if you want.)

For those only interested in winning something here and not checking out the stream I will still be giving away a copy of whichever game gets the most requests.

What To Do To Win Here?:
 1) Please upvote this post. I receive no Karma for a self text submission, and it's on the sidebar so you are supposed to do it anyway. It's just common courtesy. 
2) Make a comment that includes your Steam ID A number between 1-1000 And which game you're interested in.* 

And that's it. I will use a random number generator (random.org) to pick the winner(s) and it will be done live and recorded so you can watch it happen if so desired. (If this thread blow up again I may have to change how the winner is selected.)

Please help spread the word about this if you like what I'm trying to do. The more people the more money we can raise for the charity we have going over at http://www.extra-life.org/participant/UGN.

I apologize for the self promotion with my stream, it's just how I like to do my giveaways and it's literally the only social interaction I get. Last weekend after hitting front page was genuinely two of the best days I've had in as far back as I can remember despite everything else that happened. I love doing this and always will. Any feedback would be GREATLY appreciated as I hope to see a lot of you in the near future!

Take a look at the previous days if you're new to the giveaway. For the rest of you, on to today's giveaway! Today I'm giving away a Steam key for RAGE and a Steam key for Homefront. Here are the instructions:  

* Upvote this post for visibility – it's common courtesy and part of the subreddit rules, but I'll list it anyway.  
* Today I want to know one or more movies you'd recommend everyone see at least once. They don't have to be excellent movies – much like games, where some may not necessarily be great games but should still be played for the experience – just movies you think everyone should watch.  
* State which game you're interested in. If you'd be interested in any of them, say so, although you may want to indicate which you'd prefer.  
* Please note that your reddit account must fulfill one of these requirements to be eligible: 3+ months of age, 300+ combined karma, **or** 3+ game giveaways in this or other subreddits.


As usual, winners will be chosen in 24 hours. Good luck!  

*~~Edit: I'm currently going through the entries of yesterday's giveaway, but due to the nature of the giveaway it may take a while to choose the winners.~~*
*Done choosing yesterday's winners after two and a half hours - so far, as a music lover, that was my favorite day.*  

**Edit: Wow, this is the most popular giveaway yet, with almost 90 entries and currently at 12 hours to go. This is going to be an ""eeny meeny miney mo"" kind of giveaway, especially considering the fact that I haven't seen 90% of these movies. I'm not sure I thought that through...**

**Today I have to admit that I threw everyone's usernames in a spreadsheet, used random.org to generate two strings of 10 numbers and letters, and chose the winners by finding which usernames were closest (for example, the string that chose Deutschbury started with D-I-T - I narrowed the usernames down to the ones beginning with D, then found the one with the second character closest to I, which made the T and the other 7 characters irrelevant because there was only one username beginning with DE). Using this method, Deutschbury and ButImUsingMyWholeAss won today's giveaway! I apologize to anyone expecting me to choose the winners the same way as the the other giveaways - there were simply too many entries, I hadn't seen most of the movies listed (but I now have a long list to watch), and I obviously couldn't sit down and watch all of the movies in the same way I could listen to all of the music entries yesterday.**",,True,,t5_2t5mo,1362028064.0,,,True,t3_19b654,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/19b654/17day_birthdaycakeday_giveaway_day_10_rage/,

1373879334.0,119,self.RandomActsOfGaming,1ibvri,"Hey folks, trying to pay it forward.",127,8,658,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1ibvri/hey_folks_trying_to_pay_it_forward/,"Last year a buddy bought me quite a few games on Steam because I was having money issues. This year I have my shit under control and he told me to buy games for other people instead of him, paying it forward. Soooo, here's the deal: 

1. Pick a number between 1 and 1000. 

2. Post that number and the title of the game (or DLC, if it's bundled that's easiest, if not then only post one) you want. 

3. I have a budget of ~$200. The person who posts closest to my chosen number gets theirs first, second closest second etc. When I run out of money I stop. Note that if everyone posts for games that aren't on sale or games that are only like 10% off then the budget burns out really fast and less people will get in on this. 

I'll check tonight before I go to bed, I may extend it an extra 6 hours or so past 24 depending on interest level. 

Oh, and if after we're done here you didn't get what you wanted but legitimately ""need"" the game, like for instance if you live in India and can't buy Fallout because you can kill Brahmin in it, message me and we'll figure something out, a trade or whatever. 

**Edit 1:** Holy shit on a stick folks. 147 entries in like 4 hours? Jesus. I honestly didn't expect this reaction... Which I ought to have. Because who doesn't like free stuff. I'll probably be cutting this off at the twelve hour mark. 

I've started putting names and numbers into a spreadsheet so that I can determine which entries are winners. I'll be using a random number generator, so that there's no accusations of cheating (as if I'd cheat on my own giveaway. I've already decided what I will lose.) As per the rules on the sidebar, I won't be gifting you if your account is under thirty days old (unless your account was fairly active before the sale started.) Tonight I plan on drinking German beer and doing numbers and shit. It's going to take some time so if I take a few days to get to all of the winners please don't lynch me, I have to go to work and do adult garbage too unfortunately. 

**Edit 2:** [Here's the spreadsheet I'm using. Just in case y'all were wondering.](http://www.editgrid.com/user/tovarishch/Giveaway_Summer_2013#) 

**Edit 3:** Holy shit guys what did I get myself in to 

Fuck sleep, I guess, I'm gonna be up late 

**Edit 4:** Okay, so y'all have broken my RES, it's stuck on 6 notifications no matter how many are actually there. To answer some questions I'm getting in my inbox: 

*Tova, my name isn't in the spreadsheet you linked!* 

I'm getting to it, hold your horses, there's literally 400 something entries. I can't believe there's still 5 hours left, I'm gonna be swamped. 

*Tova, what do the third and fourth columns mean?* 

Just me keeping my sanity in the third, ignore it I guess, and the fourth is account age, I've already deleted some entries for having accounts that are hours or days old. 

Right, I'm going to the gym to prepare my body for the sins I'm going to commit tonight so I'll not be updating or commenting for a few hours. See y'all then. 

**Edit 5:** Back from the gym. I've finished updating the chart for the time being, I expect more by the time the 12 hour limit rolls around. We've got around 400 entries in total, minus the ones I've DQ'd for young accounts (mind you, this wasn't all of them, I actually reviewed their account histories and made a decision for each one. THIS IS HOW DEDICATED I AM TO PROVIDING YOU FUCKS WITH A QUALITY EXPERIENCE. THIS IS ALSO HOW OCD I AM.) Also some of you buggers didn't put a number within the range I provided, like 6000 something and other such nonsense, and some of you didn't write which game you wanted. I'm telling y'all now, there's no second chances, when that hour hits I'm clamping down on this so that I can get to work on acquiring games and distributing them to the lucky winners. No time to waste, only time to spend :). 

Okay, and since this is the ***last edit*** I'll be doing before I complete the thread, I've come to the conclusion that since I want to get more games to more people, I will probably only be buying the five ""expensive"" games closest to the randomly chosen integer. It's hard to put into words what I want to do but trust me, I know what I'm doing. This will make it so that as many people as possible get something fun to play for the next few months / weeks / days / hours. 

See y'all in around 2 hours! Best of luck to everyone! 

***OKAY GUYS I LIED*** 

Guess what folks? I JUST GOT A PROMOTION. Happy Monday to me! And to y'all, too- I'm gonna celebrate by raising my budget. A substantial amount. Get excited guys. For real. TIME FOR MORE BEER

Edit#1 : Wow this is turning out to be more popular than I expected. I've added the Portal Bundle (Portal 1 + 2 )  - If you want to change to that instead of plain old Portal 1 then update your comment.

I checked and according to the information on Amazon the activation keys should work on Steam.
The games in question are:

* Bioshock
* Bioshock 2
* Duke Nukem Forever Complete Pack
* Sid Meier’s Civilization V, GOTY Edition
* The Stronghold Collection

If you are interested in one of those games, please leave a number between 1 - 100 and  the name of the game you are interested (only 1 game per person) . I will pick a winner Monday evening (PST).

Please let me know if you have questions.
Good luck. 

Edit 1: Please try to make sure that the number you picked is unique.

Edit 2:Boy that escalated quickly. I did not expect the demand to be so high. I decided that if the number of interested persons for one game should exceed 100 I will just draw a name from the pool. I hope that is ok for you, sorry for the confusion. Next time I will just use a higher number.

**Final results**
I started sometime between 6 and 7pm with sorting the list. I generated the number for each game with a [random number generator](http://www.random.org/). If several people picked that number I made the computer pick one. The winner are:

* Civ V: GagLV 
* Bioshock: vivakyuss 
* Bioshock 2: raj000777
* Stronghold: SRelic
* Duke Nukem: Maniacal

For the past 3-5 years I have suffered through clinical depression. I was always too afraid to seek help or tell anybody because I thought I would be seen as fragile or weak. I didn't even talk to my then girlfriend about it. About 3 months ago I finally decided to see a doctor and was immediately put on medication and reccommended. This took about a month to kick in and has been fairly effective at taking the edge off of my previously miserable life, I had virtually no friends and everybody at my school hated me for no reason. I broke up with my girlfriend a few weeks after because things weren't working out between us and she started dating somebody 5 days later which hurt me a lot. It brought me back to the point where I wanted to kill myself everyday. I slowly got over it though and started opening myself up to other options. I decided to ask out somebody in my school that is way out of my league because I think she is pretty, nice, smart and funny. She said yes when I asked her and we should be going out soon, maybe tomorrow. My life has been on the up-and-up for a while now, I don't even have to see my therapist anymore.  
My goal for this giveaway is to tell anybody who has been in a similar situation that it does get better so get help, and I want to try to make somebody's day like this sub has done for me before.  
**tl;dr:** Depression. Done. Giveaway to help others.    

I will choose one winner, using redditraffle after 24 hours, or after my potential date tomorrow night, whichever comes later. I will then buy the winner whatever game (s)he chooses on Steam and send it to them. Now for the rules ... In order to be eligible you need to post the most ironic story of your life that upon looking back on is funny **OR** post a picture of your most cherished/impressive thing you own. *Pics or it's not true.*    

Sorry for the long post people of Reddit but there is a specific reason I am doing this. I do not want any sympathy, but will accept any and all questions you guys may or may not have (PM's are fine). Please upvote for visibility, as it is in the rules. Have a great life everybody!  
Edit: Giveaway information ... oops O.o  
**Edit 2:** Thank you for the great responses everybody! Unfortunately, my potential date never happened because I told her I think that she is amazing, funny, smart and pretty and that I wanted us to be going on a date and that's when she decided that she would tell me that she has a boyfriend back home. Its all good though because I know things will happen in their own time and maybe this just wasn't meant to be. Sorry to disappoint you guys!

I am making a list of names for all interested people and then randomly picking a winner based on the list.  I have also decided to only raffle of these games, no longer interested in a trade. This is the original post:

I got a steam code for both of these games with a new video card I purchased. I have no interest in either of these and would much rather see them go to someone that will get some use out of them. If you want to trade for them that would be great, but ultimately I just wanted to them to go somewhere that they will be loved and appreciated.

EDIT: Since more people are interested than anticipated, I will keep track of everyone that is interested and draw a name at random when I get home from work tonight which will be around 6 PM Central time.


EDIT 2: If you show interest I will add you to the list, scouts honor, although I am having a hard time keeping up with letting everyone know since my work day is in full swing now. I am truly honored that so many people are excited and interested and I wish everyone the best of luck!


EDIT 3: To make sure that no rules are broken here I am extending the giveaway to 3-22-2013 at 7 AM.

Final Edit: The final winner is Intact! Thanks for playing, everyone!

I got a code for AC3 with my new computer, but I've already seen it beaten. I thought it would be nice if someone got to enjoy the copy, though!

Only requirement is that you comment with a number between 1-300, and I'll random.org a number tomorrow (after 12 hours or so :P). Winner will be the number who gets closest (above or below).

Not necessary or in any way required, but if you're a twitch.tv member and enjoy watching Guild Wars 2 played, I'd love more followers at my channel: http://www.twitch.tv/monsterpants (again, no pressure whatsoever if you don't have an account/it doesn't interest you/guild wars 2 killed your parents). I'll also happily remove this addendum if it's in violation of the rules. :)


**Edit: Holy crap, that's a lot of comments!** I honestly didn't expect this much response. Someone suggested that I change the number from 1-1000, but that would make it a trifle biased toward anyone who guessed 300 or higher. So, here's the deal. I'm leaving this open until 5pm CST tomorrow, and extending the range to 1000. **If you have already commented, you're welcome to edit your comment** if you want to change your number. Otherwise I'll just run the randomizer, and if there's a double or a tie, then we'll go to a second round of number guesses for those folks. Seems complicated, but I'd like it to be as fair to everyone as possible. And I'm really sorry that I can't just offer to buy another copy to give away, lol!",,True,,t5_2t5mo,1354155257.0,,,True,t3_13sz1f,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/13sz1f/giveaway_free_code_for_assassins_creed_3_download/,

**EDIT**: Some FYI... I did not want to limit this to just a set number. **Do not pick a number this is just an example**  Example pick a number from 1-1000. 


So to allow for the maximum number of people and guarantee a winner, I will be taking the number of comments and throwing that number into a random generator. Then i will count out the posts till I get to the winner. Example if you posted first your number is 1, posted second your number is 2 and so on...

I have personally (In the last five minutes), found seven reddit accounts that are between 6 hours and 15 days old. Between those and others that are nearly a year old with ZERO activity outside of giveaway subs, I have come to a conclusion about these types of accounts.

However, I would like some feedback before I implement any action in this matter. I created this sub for the users and people like myself who have a very hard time coming up with the funds for gaming stuffs. *This has since changed some for myself because of my brother and AWESOME redditors!!! Truly you guys have been great!*

Yet with all of this abuse and blatant multi accounting. I want to do something about it. The users who are generous enough to give something away certainly don't want their giveaways abused by people who enter multiple times with different reddit accounts. Just as entrants don't want or need their chances diminished by cheaters and those who disrespect this sub.

So, I need your help. With nearly eight thousand people who visit this sub on a regular basis; It's very hard to keep up with all of the entrants and different accounts. I ask that every redditor here do their part if they see suspicious activity. 

Never hesitate to report a post or user for what you believe is a violation of our guidelines and overall common decency. 

Beyond that I welcome and ask for any opinions on the matter on how these accounts should be handled. While I did create this sub and I have three mods who I trust with it's policing. I still want the input and suggestions from those who frequent this sub. After all, this is a place for YOU!

Thank you for your time, I am eager to hear your responses.

The winner can receive the activation key, or I can ship the physical copy of the game to you.  one option is obviously faster than the other.  the other two are steam editions.


So, you can enter in one of two ways.

1) tell me about a game that made you incredibly sad in a good way.  I don't want to hear stories about how a game was so bad it made you cry, because I've seen enough of that from ME3 to last me a lifetime.  please don't say in 100 words what you could in 10.

I also will personally ask each person for their permission to post their submission myself if they choose not to. 

I will choose the winner based on creativity and content alone. How your post does will have ZERO impact on my decision. Reddit is a fickle mistress and we all know of her sting.

I will chose a winner Monday morning before 12pm EST. Good luck, I eagerly await your entries!

To be considered a valid entry, you must:

* Have an account that is at least 2 months (60 days) old
* Have at least 150 cumulative karma
* Be active in subreddits other than giveaway subs

~~To enter, pick a number from 1-1000.~~ Be sure to ctrl/cmd-f beefore posting! If multiple people pick the same number, the winner will be whoever picked the number first.

**Edit 2:** Ok, it seems like a lot of people aren't aware of how comment formatting on Reddit works. It will take any numbered list and regardless of the number, start the numbering at 1.

So, if you format your comment like this:

It won't increase your chances of winning, since I'll be using random.org to select the number, but there might be a **special secret prize** for one of you who put in the effort!

Well, that's all, good luck and I hope I make someone happy in ~24 hours!

**Update: So I can already say that the rule about only winning once has to be dropped. There may be 179 entries, but that is individual entries - not 179 people. From here on out, people can win multiple sets; when you have four people enter a set with six prizes and two of those four also make up another tiny entry group, there's nothing to be done but drop that rule.**

Today is the final day of the giveaway! I've had a lot of fun with this, and I hope everyone else has too. Because there are so many prizes today, I've divided them into 8 different sets, with a different type of entry for each set. Some sets will ask for similar entries as previous days' giveaways, and you can use entries you've used previously if you like. You can enter as many sets as you like, you're not limited to only one. However, you can only win once. Hopefully the multiple sets will allow (and encourage) everyone to enter. If there aren't enough entries, I'll extend the giveaway by 24 hours, but I'd like to think there won't be a lack of entries today.  

Without further ado, onto the list of giveaway sets. Please try to read and follow the directions carefully and format your comments to cause the least amount of confusion possible – today will be a busy day! I've posted a sample entry at the bottom of the list.  

**Set 1 – Humble Bundle Mojam x3**  

For the indie lovers. Comment with the set number and describe one or more indie games you feel everyone should play.  

**Set 2 – Humble Bundle for Android 5 x3**  

For the Android/Linux/Mac gamers – you haven't had a giveaway all to yourself yet. Comment with the set number, state your favorite Android/Linux/Mac game (doesn't have to be for all three OSs), and post a screenshot of your Android/Linux/Mac system.

**Set 3 – Talisman Prologue x3, Fibrillation x3**  

For the lovers of non-mainstream types of games. Comment with the set number, describe your favorite game that isn't the usual rehashed type, and state which game(s) you're interested in.  

**Set 4 – Darwinia soundtrack x3, Defcon Soundtrack x3**  

For the music lovers. Comment with the set number, tell your favorite game soundtrack, and state which soundtrack(s) you're interested in.  

**Set 5 – Uplink, Demigod, Hearts of Iron 3,  Galactic Civilizations I: Ultimate Edition, King Arthur Collection**  

For the lazy, a random number giveaway. Comment with the set number, a number between 1 and 500, and which game(s) you're interested in. The entries with the numbers closest to those randomly generated will win.  

**Set 6 –  Uplink, Demigod, Hearts of Iron 3,  Galactic Civilizations I: Ultimate Edition, King Arthur Collection**  

For the jokers. Comment with the set number, make me laugh in any way you like, and state which game(s) you're interested in.  

**Set 7 –  Uplink, Demigod, Hearts of Iron 3,  Galactic Civilizations I: Ultimate Edition, King Arthur Collection**  

For those that wanted me to do something I didn't include/think of. Comment with the set number, post whatever the heck you want (favorite website, a drawing, music you want me to listen to, whatever), and state which game(s) you're interested in.  

**Set 8 – Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine, Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor, The Binding of Isaac+DLC**  

I'll give you a few options to enter this giveaway set because I know it will be popular.  
1) Comment with the set number, post a new Steam icon you designed for me, and state which game(s) you're interested in.  
2) Comment with the set number, take a look at [my most-played games on Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/tkdchick218/games?tab=all) , recommend a game I don't have based on a game I've played a lot, and state which game(s) you're interested in.  
3) Comment with the set number, tell about a game you play that you're embarrassed to admit you enjoy, and state which game(s) you're interested in.  

    Sample Entry:  
    
    ~Set 1~  
    Audiosurf is a great game for anyone that enjoys music – I like to describe it as Guitar Hero mixed with racing.  
    
    ~Set 2~  
    FTL is one of the best popular games on Steam that is available on Linux right now. The gameplay is always a little different, and you'll never know what you'll find. (insert screenshot of my linux desktop here, I'm too lazy to switch to my Mint partition in order to take a screenshot)  
    
    ~Set 3~  
    Uplink is a really neat hacking simulator, which is something you don't see every day. I'd like Fibrillation, please.  
    
    ~Set 4~  
    Bastion has an epic folk music soundtrack. I haven't even played the game yet, but the music was worth the purchase. I'm interested in the Darwinia soundtrack.  
    
    ~Set 5~  
    218, Uplink.  
    
    ~Set 6~  
    What did OP remind the people reading this?  
    The answers I've given aren't off-limits for the giveaway, I don't want to steal anyone's legitimate entry for the example entry.  
    
    ~Set 7~  
    I love [this YouTuber's videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/penguinz0?feature=watch). Demigod  
    
    ~Set 8~  
    Warhammer please.

I have no way of knowing if you have played it or not, but we're on the honor system here, and I trust you guys.

Also, reddit accounts should be at least 1 week old. Sorry new account. 

Other than that, there are no other restrictions. I will choose the winners in 1 week, on April 23rd, sometime during the day.

In honor of both this and the fact that today is apparently my cake day, I've decided to gift a game to somebody. 

Even though I got paid today, I'm not exactly swimming in cash, so I can't afford to get somebody Assassin's Creed 3 or something, but I can gift a game around $10-15. No, choosing a cheaper game won't increase your odds, for the record. 

Now, what do I want? I want to know your favorite piece of art and why. It could be any art medium: A game, a song, an entire album, a painting, a sculpture, a book, a poem, etc. Tell me what it is and why it means so much to you. 

It doesn't have to be PC either, if you can find a console game that fits the description including shipping (I have around 15 confirmed trades on /r/gameswap, so I think I can be trusted with an address). 

So leave your response, as well as the game you'd like and the platform/SteamID. 

I'll choose a winner some time tomorrow. 

Good luck!

EDIT: Wow, there are *a lot* of responses. I'll be picking a winner later tonight, but I will try to respond to people regardless of who I pick, cause I've got a lot of new art to check out.

EDIT 2: This was insane. A huge number of entries and so many of them were fantastic, thank you all so much for entering and sharing some great art. I'm going to go with /u/kupovi as the winner here, so congrats to him! I'll also be replying to people as I see fit. I mean, you guys shared some great art with me, so I figure I should address it.

Hello Guys and Gals! TotallyGeeky here, and if that was a surprise, then you need to learn to read better. 

I'm gonna get right down to business. Each prize group will correlate to the numbers after the list of games to win. Follow the instructions and post your entry below. I'll be taking entries on here and on PiF, so some will be awarded in here, and some will not. This will be open for about 2-3 days, I'll give you guys a 6 hour warning when I feel like it. Hooray for specifics!

*FOR EVERY ENTRY, I REQUIRE THE FOLLOWING (AND THE SPECIFICS FOR EACH ENTRY):*

* 300 Combined Karma 

* 3 Month Old Account 

* A link to your steam profile (which must be at least 3 months old, and have at least 3 non F2P games) 

I'll add other rules at my discretion, but I think that covers most of it. 

Here's the specific entry conditions for each group. 

***DON'T FORGET, THESE WINNERS WILL BE PICKED AT MY DISCRETION***

-----------------------------------------

***GROUP 1***

You must write a story me a story. But, I'm feeling like a bit of self promotion (Kinda), so you must write the story about one of Noah Bradley's art pieces, seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/5v2q7#0), see  /r/noahbradley for more. Write a background about the scene, write a biography for a character, write a narrative about any of it, just give me something and link the image you worked with. Minimum length of the story is enough to give the picture a background, a narrative would be nice. 

-------------------------------------------------

***GROUP 2***

I'd like to treat my girlfriend to some cute pictures, so I need the cutest things around. Cats are king in this competition, but good variety is encouraged. The more the merrier for this competition, more will always help. 

--------------------------------------------------

***GROUP 3***

You will write me a poem, confessing your love for me. I make you do this because I love these games in the section an extra large amount. Actual poetry will do a lot better than pseudo-prose. Working in my interests will make your poem even better. Minimum of 12 lines, Although a general rule will be the longer the better. Unless it's shitty. Then I'll be disappointed that you wasted that much time on it. 

---------------------------------------------

***GROUP 4***

It's the Valve games, so in honor you need to trade me an unusual. Just kidding, I just want you to either make me a pretty little picture of a new TF2 unusual effect (must be made by you), or..... Actually, that's it. I just want a picture of your idea for a new effect. The better it is, the better your chances. Also, optional is to design a new hat too.

------------------------------------------

***GROUP 5***

DOTA 2, brah. Just comment saying you want it, and link me an amazing song. Bonus points if you involve my favorite genres (dubstep, jazz, trap, or electroswing).

* Post a screenshot of your computer's desktop. If you don't want to share your actual desktop, post your wallpaper (remember to tag as NSFW when necessary).

* State which game you're interested in. If you'd be interested in either one, say so, although you may want to indicate which you'd prefer.  
* Please note that your reddit account must fulfill one of these requirements to be eligible: 3+ months of age, 300+ combined karma, or 3+ game giveaways in this or other subreddits.  

That's it! I was telling the truth when I said yesterday's instructions would be the most difficult of the entire giveaway. I'll pick the winners in 24 hours as usual. Once again, feel free to ask any questions you may have.

but then I figured that these games go on sale way too often to have much value...

especially when the ones I want are relatively unknown (PLEASE support Indie titles, AND [but mostly] games translated to English, thanks :D) and most of the trades I've seen only seem to have the popular titles that are always on sale. /grumble

SO I MIGHT AS WELL GIVE IT AWAY AS A BIRTHDAY BASH INSTEAD BECAUSE I LOVE ALL OF YOU (not really). 

----------------

In any case

Game List: 

* Supreme Commander 2 (2 Copies, 1 MAY OR MAY NOT WORK, I RECEIVED 1 COPY FROM A TRADE)

* Titan Quest Gold

* Zeno Clash

* Cave Story+

* Basement Collection

* Binding of Isaac

* Shank 2

* Bioshock

* Bioshock 2

* DOTA 2 (6 copies, I don't think there's anybody left who doesn't have this)

* Brazen Prototype (3 copies, I DONT THINK ANYBODY WANTS THIS LOL)

Everything there is a Steam key except Zeno Clash and DOTA2 which is in my inventory.

----------------

**Rules**

* You may pick up to two games you want. The one you want more first, the second one on bottom. 

* Accounts must be made before December 14th, 2012 and there MUST be activity in other sub-reddits as well. 

* Total Karma must add up to 150 just as another weeding tool. I'm sorry but I'm just trying to make sure there are no rabid leechers.

* Name a game that you think is really not known, but why you like it (For example, I like eXceed because touhou isn't on Steam while eXceed is. No this is not serious because I don't own eXceed yet &gt;_&gt;)

* Number between 1-1000 is nessesary, use ctrl+f to make sure you have a unique number

* Banana.

I'm keeping track of all the games I'm interested in (and able to get) on a notepad. Thanks for all your submissions :D. I'm mostly looking for hidden gems since it's always nice to find something... different.


It's also amazing how people screwed themselves over just by picking ONLY the games they wanted AND the number. Not the 3rd requirement, which I don't know if people just skimmed through or didn't read carefully:


the rule was to mention a game you feel is relatively unknown, meaning if you don't know anybody that plays Borderlands for example, then that's relatively unknown TO YOU, which would count, also I would have no idea way to tell if you just googled title to put in without ever playing it. 

JUST THROWING THAT IN THERE. READ THE FINE PRINT (well, pay attention to it to those affected?).

The banana part was just there because... banana.

This week The Quick Time Event is giving away **The Walking Dead**. Please upvote if you enter so that we can hopefully get a lot of great submissions!

Official contest rules (tl;dr): 

To be entered into the drawings for these games we need your ideas! We're crafting an imaginary zombie apocalypse game. You are the main protagonist and have the help of two support characters. Who do you want by your side in the game? They can be characters from any form of fiction be it Movies, Video Games, Books, TV Shows, you name it. Let us know who you'd like to see and a short explanation of why and you'll be in the contest.

**Example:** 

*Sponge Bob and Optimus Prime*

We'd have Sponge Bob's determination and levity but also Optimus Prime's ability to be a giant robot and also a car. We could ride to the ocean and flee to a pineapple under the sea.

We'll be picking the entry that we like the best! The judging will be held this Thursday night around 7pm EST and we'll post the winner on the following Saturday afternoon when the 'cast goes live! Please see below for more info:

**Update:** Congrats to BarbaRuiva on the win! Sending you the game now!


****************

Please excuse the long explanation. I promise that games are being given away here. For a long time now my friends and I have been playing games and sometimes blogging about them as a hobby. We all work full time and are approaching 30 but decided that it would be a fun project to start a gaming podcast, less for the purpose of trying to aspire to the ranks of the numerous famous and informative podcasts out there but more just so that we have something of a digital record of our little get togethers and a weekly chronicle of our adult lives focusing around the hobby that we all share. 

We draw our influences from Giant Bomb, The Final Score, Video Games Hotdog, The Escapist, Podtoid, Idle Thumbs, Weekend Confirmed, Gamers with Jobs and Player One Podcast. 

Recently we decided that we'd like to introduce giveaways to our show! Because giving away free games makes you feel good! If you have a hole in your podcast rotation, new to games podcasts (there are a lot of them) or just want to win a free game, we'd really appreciate it if you would give us a listen. 

We'll choose a winner whose submission we like the best (we're weird and have kind of a dark sense of humor, so keep that in mind). 

All of the games that we'll be giving away are Steam games that we will send as direct gifts to the winners. They will either be in the form of direct registration keys or we may ask you to message us on Steam so that we can gift it to your directly.

Of course, the podcast is free and so are all of the contests. You don't need to buy anything or give away your email address or social security number or anything! All you'll need to do is post a valid comment in this thread to be entered into the drawing.  Thank you for reading! Most of all we would love some kind of feedback for how to make the podcast better and more like something you would like to listen to every week. Tap X! We are The Quick Time Event.

I really appreciate ALL of your entries, thanks a lot and happy gaming!**





Simple enough: give me a LINK to your Steam page, as well as the title of the game you'd like to win, and tell me what interests you most about that game and why I should give it to you!

Your Reddit and Steam accounts MUST be at least 60 days old, and I'd really prefer to give the game to someone who has less than 30 or so games. 

I'll pick the winner sometime tomorrow, so get ready, get set...go!

Edit: Guys, please upvote this post so more people have a chance to enter, it'd be much appreciated! Thanks.

Edit 2: Getting some great entries here, but come on, some of you folks aren't even trying! If you expect me to spend ~10 dollars of my hard earned cash you better put more than 5 seconds into it! ;) So please follow the guidelines and tell me what interests you in the game and why you think you should get it! Thanks everyone! :) The more effort you put into it, the more likely I am to choose your entry. I *AM* biased! :D

I found the confines of some of them stifling and wanted a free forum to host giveaways for the raw purpose of giving something gaming related to another *Redditor*. This site is responsible for so much good. I think it's perfectly fine to have a sub where we can give back.

I myself have been one of the lucky ones to receive incredible help. Redditors *in my experience* are pretty special people willing to help and to give selflessly without asking for anything in return. Because of that I will maintain this sub to the degree of quality that I originally meant for it. 

In that spirit users who are found out to be scammers and the like WILL be banned. The reasons and causes for these bans will vary greatly, but each and every one will be carefully looked over and thought out by the mods of this sub.

We have fair and rather simple *for the most part* guidelines. As the creator it is my responsibility to make sure these guidelines are adhered to. I speak with my mods frequently regarding changing/updating or altering these guidelines. Every time we talk about them the point of focus is pure and simple; Fairness.

We WELCOME input regarding these guidelines so long as it can be presented in a respectful manor. This sub is not perfect, but with your help we can be pretty damn close.

I will be sure to give away the games before 1pm EST (when Steam daily deals update) to ensure that nobody loses out on a chance to win just because something that was daily deal isn't anymore.**

**More edit - To any new entries, or people who look back on their entries, please edit in your game or steam id if possible if you want anything that's on sale that will end before the daily deals update. I completely forgot to mention this earlier.**

**Edit Again - It's 12:03pm EST, closing sign ups, will be finding winners. Just editting now first because holy crap Krampski hurts my brain. Kudos to him though. Please post if you've used a code so people stop hurting their brains over it, thanks.**

**Probably Last Edit -

WINNER 1, 501

WINNER 2, 574

Note to self - Decrease number size. 1-1000 is too high., requires a lot of rerolling when there are only about 1/4th of the numbers picked. Will be 1-500 next time to save myself time probably.

Please comment here to confirm receipt.**

I've been spending way too much money on games. I think I might be a compulsive on-sale game buyer. In any case, buying various bundles on sale has left me with some extra keys. Mostly Steam, a few GOG, a couple Topware from the Groupees bundle. Don't have many gamer friends and Reddit seems kinda cool, so I figured I'd give these away here.

* **Cubemen** - MacAppDeals - Windows/Mac/Linux - **mysterioussir**
* **The Darkness II** - GMG - Windows/Mac - **reese_ridley**
* **Defenders of Ardania** - IndieGala - Windows - **ShaxAjax**

* **Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine** - Amazon - Windows - **TheDeadlyFuzz**
* **Warlock: Master of the Arcane** - IndieGala - Windows - **globebiscuit**

I'm gonna say one game per person, but Earth 2140-2160 can go together and Red Orchestra can go together. Tell me where you live (just the city), what kind of work you do, what your OS is, and what your favorite game is. And, of course, which game you want. Not sure yet how I'm going to pick. Is there a standard method?

Please comment upon receipt. I'm thinking about doing some Steam trading here and this would help establish my rep.

Edit: Going to give this until noon tomorrow (Tuesday). Will try to send out keys by midnight.

1356902767.0,68,self.RandomActsOfGaming,15otir,[GIVEAWAY]  $20 Steam New Years Giveaway!!!,79,11,284,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/15otir/giveaway_20_steam_new_years_giveaway/,"2013 is approaching, so I thought what better time for another giveaway!  The grandprize for this giveaway is whatever games you want up to $20 off of Steam.  It can be one game, or it can be multiple games, as long as it doesn't go over $20.  There will also be a second and third place price as well, details below!

To be eligible for the contest, it will be required that you have been a member of reddit at least 3 months with a minimum of 100 comment karma.  You will also need a Steam account and be able to receive Steam gifts because that is how I will be sending the main prizes!

To enter, I just require you comment with the following:

What was one of your favorite games that you played in 2012 and why.  It doesn't have to be a game that came out in 2012, just a game that you really just got into during the year and why you liked it so much.  Once you do this you will be entered into the contest!

Now on how the winners will be determined.  For the grandprize of up to $20 in Steam games, that will go to what I consider the best submission.  I will be reading them all and the one that I feel best describes the game and makes me want to play it will be chosen.  Doesn't have to be a game that I may like or one that I played or have not played, just something that you liked and I want that to come across in your comment.  

If you don't get chosen for the grand prize, there are other prizes to be won and these will be chosen at random.  Once the grandprize winner has been chosen, everyone else who is eligible will be entered into a random drawing.  One second place winner will be chosen, followed by a third place. 

For Second place, the winner gets to choose 2 prizes from the following:

-up to $5 Steam game

-Titans Quest Steam key

-Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War Steam key

-Stalker Shadows of Chernobyl Steam key

-Red Faction Armageddon Steam key

For Third place, the winner can choose any one of the leftover games from above.

This contest will run until 1/1/2013 at 10pm PST.  I will go through all the entries at that point when I can and then run the random drawings for the other prizes.  I will contact winners ASAP to determine what prizes are to be awarded.  All winners must respond to me within 24hours after I first contact them about their prizes otherwise I will have to disqualify them and choose another winner.  I ask if you enter that you are able to check your reddit messages at least once a day so that this does not happen.

Anyways, good luck to all!  Any questions or comments, just let me know!  If I left anything out I will be sure to post an update but I think that is it!

EDIT 1:  

Okay the giveaway has ended!  I will now be reading through all entries to determine the grandprize winner.  After that I will then run the drawing for 2nd and 3rd place.  I will PM the winners ASAP.

EDIT 2: 

I went through all the entries and there were several that stood out to me but ultimately I had to decide so the grand prize winner is:

distinctvagueness 2!!!

It was a hard choice because there were several standouts but ultimately the way distinctvagueness describes the fictional background story they made up for minor characters in a game really appealed to me.  It's always a sign you are deep into a game when you start coming up with your own stories about the game.  I am now PMing the winner for confirmation and I will be doing the drawing shortly for the remaining prizes.  

I also want to thank everyone who participated.  I read many interesting entries and a few of you got me interested in some games I knew either little or nothing about.  I just bought Crusader Kings 2 after just hearing some descriptions about it a couple days ago on here.  I'm also wanting to check out FTL when I had little interest in the game previously.  Thanks again for all the great entries!

EDIT 3:

For the second place random drawing, the winner is:

taotao670!!!  

I am PMing them now and once they decide on their two games I will do the random drawing for third place. 

EDIT 4:

Okay the grand prize winner has already been notified, just trying to get what games he wants worked out.  Second place, taotao670 had decided on his two prizes and he chose Stalker and a Steam game under $5 which he chose the Max Payne collection.  Since second place has already been taken care of, I ran the drawing for third place which went to:

Squeedledorf!!!

I am now PMing Squeedledorf for confirmation. 

EDIT 5:

Okay, I was able to get a hold of distinctvagueness again and he chose his games!  He chose Sniper Elite Franchise Pack, Tomb Raider Anniversary,The Longest Journey, and Dungeons of Dredmor, totaling just under $20!  Steam sales are awesome!  

Now just trying to get a hold of third place winner.  

And thanks again everyone for the awesome entries!

FINAL EDIT:

I got in contact with Squeedledorf and have finally got the last prize out.  Squeedledorf chose the Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic bundle for less than $5!  Awesome choice!

Thanks everyone for participating and commenting!  Hope everyone has a most excellent 2013!

* Post your favorite screenshot you've taken in a game. [This is mine](http://i.imgur.com/ZHS4IAa.jpg) for the sole fact that it (somewhat) shows the beauty of Skyrim at night.  
* State which game you're interested in. If you'd be interested in any of them, say so, although you may want to indicate which you'd prefer.  
* Please note that your reddit account must fulfill one of these requirements to be eligible: 3+ months of age, 300+ combined karma, or 3+ game giveaways in this or other subreddits.

In my opinion, getting indie games through piracy is right up there with kicking puppies and punching a lady. Indie games aren't manufactured goods; they are someone's hobby. I torrented - breaking my own rule - FTL because I hear everyone praise the game but could not see the appeal through watching gameplays. It is simply a game you have to experience firsthand in order to enjoy it. 

With that said, I will be giving away a Steam copy of FTL: Faster Than Light at around 7:00 PM EST tomorrow. To win, all you have to do is answer my question: What games have you torrented and later paid for? Include details of why you torrented said game(s) and why you later paid for it. I ask because I want to try new games that are so good that they are worth paying for!

I will pick the winner based on how well thought out the answer is. (Not quantity, but quality.)

I would like to thank everyone for their participation, game suggestions, and most importantly, your integrity! The winner has been chosen and will receive his/her prize.

In the Spirit of the Holiday Season, and to spread some Gaming Love around, I have decided to do a small giveaway.   I currently have $9.00 in my Steam account and would like to use it to Gift someone an item(s) of their choice.

I know $9 isn’t much, but there are some good indie games, DLC content, and other titles on SuperSale that someone might be able to get for around this amount.

The rules are simple:

1.  Drawing will be held at 4pm on 12/4/2012.
2.  To enter, please pick a random number between 1-500.  I will use a RNG to select the winner.
3.  Write a comment, along with your random number guess, indicating what you want to get with the $9.00.*

	*It could be 1 thing worth $9 dollars or 9 things worth $1.**

Whomever comes closest to the winning number will be selected, and all of the items they listed in their comment will be Gifted, as long as the amount does not exceed $9.



If all goes well, I plan on having a few more small Giveaways leading up to Christmas, with possible 1 larger Giveaway of any title on Steam.

So, good luck on the contest and lets help spread some Gaming cheer around!

Overall, very fun game. Four player co-op requiring team work and coordination to complete various heist situations. Quite a few people online playing so it's not hard to find a game to jump into. I would say it's similar to games like Left 4 Dead, except...  cops instead of zombies and more mission specific tasks to complete said heist.

Plants Vs Zombies! It's a wonderful tower defense game that takes place in your back yard. You have to defend your home from the evil zombies with a wide variety of plants and other gardening items. It's a super fun and casual game to sit back and enjoy, but don't be fooled, it can be pretty tough at times! 

A few months ago the American Dental Association had a [PvZ promotion](http://i.imgur.com/tzZ5a3k.png), and gave away keys for the full game to people who entered a short form, and well, I went a little overboard and ended up with [70+ keys](http://i.imgur.com/f0eCvhu.png) to giveaway at a later date, and I feel they've ripened enough.

Now on to the giveaway portion, since there are so many keys, I'm going to cut straight to the point and do a simple pick a number giveaway. 

* Post in the comments a random number between 1-600 (please ctrl+f to see that your number has not already been chosen, I am not responsible for duplicated numbers!), and in roughly 24 hours I'll generate a number and the closest person to that number will receive a key.

* I'm doing this all by hand, and I might be going through a hundred or two comments,
 so finding the closest number if I can't ctrl+f the generated number might take a bit, please bear with me if you don't get a key right away.

* If you are a winner, you will receive a PM with a code that begins with **POPxxxxxxx**, you will then have to download PvZ through Popcap's website [[**direct download**](http://downloads.popcap.com/download/pvz/pc/en/latest)], and you will then be prompted to enter the key during installation. After installation and activation, you can enjoy knocking zombie's heads off!

*If the thread gets large enough and 24 hours isn't enough, I might (and probably will) bump up the time. I also will increase the number range if 300 is too low.

There will be at most 42 winners. Participating is very easy (I'm not a fan of giveaways with complicated entry requirements). Just comment with your top 3 choices for Steam/Desura games and top 3 for iOS games. 

To weed out fake accounts and spammers, you must also:

* Have a Reddit account that is at least 3 months old
* Have a combined total of at least 100 karma
* Be active in other subs or given away games before

Edit: Willing to make exceptions in some cases for the above rules.

The giveaway will end sometime this weekend, most likely Saturday afternoon (PST).

~~I will pick 3 random comments by scrolling blind and pointing at my screen and from those three I will assign numbers and use a pseudo [random number generator](http://www.random.org/) to pick.~~

~~Edit: I figured I would clarify, I will do the picking process itself(which I now realize is over complex, won't be making that mistake again) close to the time when the actual giving out of the code is done, this way I have a decent amount of comments to scroll through.~~

~~Edit2: Guys I'm a moron and didn't preempt all these flaws and I'm sorry i will simply do a random pick.
It's too late to get people to pick numbers so this is the best i can do to be somewhat fair.~~

~~If i ever give something away again it will be done by reddit-raffle. again, sorry.~~

Edit 3: Now that i fully understand Reddit raffle i have realized i can just use that, i had it confused with the picking a number and generating a number system. anybody who was previously getting upvoted or downvoted or whatever should now get a fair chance, thank you all for informing me.


I will give the code away to the recipient tomorrow at 19:20 GMT

Hello RAOG folks!  This giveaway is a bit different than others in RAOG, so let us know if it's not appropriate for this this section. It seemed to be, so we are going for it here.

Anyway, we are giving away unlimited copies of our new game [Potatoman Seeks the Troof](http://www.pixeljam.com/potatoman).  All you have to do is make some art about Potatoman, something related to Potatoman, or the Troof (which is very subjective), or really anything at all...  get creative.  If you think you can't draw, go for it anyway!   Find your inner artist and give him/her a massage. 

Email your creation to us at pixeljamgames@gmail.com and we'll send you a code for the game and soundtrack.

If you need some info on the game, a google search will get you what you need to know. There's some stuff on youtube as well.  But like we said it doesn't have to be about Potatoman, it's just recommended.

**This giveaway ends Friday, Jan 25.**

I could even have multiple types of entries, because there are a *lot* of keys to be given out tomorrow. Be ready! Here are today's instructions:  

* Upvote this post for visibility – it's common courtesy and part of the subreddit rules, but I'll list it anyway.  
* State what game had the most memorable story for you. The game didn't necessarily have to have the best gameplay or the prettiest graphics, today I'm just interested in plot.
* (Not required, but recommended): Tell what you'd like me to do for the final day of the giveaway tomorrow. Is there any particular idea for a contest you'd like me to implement?  
* State which game you're interested in. If you'd be interested in any of them, say so, although you may want to indicate which you'd prefer.  
* Please note that your reddit account must fulfill one **(only one is necessary)** of these requirements to be eligible: 3+ months of age, 300+ combined karma, **or** 3+ game giveaways in this or other subreddits.  

As usual, winners will be chosen in 24 hours. Winners for the weekend's giveaway will be chosen in 24 hours as well. Good luck!

It's been a lot of fun and it's been amazing to see the growth and attention you all put into this place. The generosity so many of you have shared with others is the essence of this subreddit and essentially ""makes the world go 'round."" In relation to our rules, our rules have been worked on to be as fair as possible for anyone who likes to check our subreddit at anytime. Rule #2 specifically gives a good chance to almost anyone to join any thread. 

Now, with that said, I'd like to touch on something that we've been noticing. We try to keep our rules as fair as possible and receive as much user input as we can on how people feel it should work. Largely we've seen that people like our rules, and especially don't mind rule #2. Now for the large majority of posts this is absolutely no problem, but in the recent short while we've been seeing quite a few threads stray from this.

As it is, we may either need to enforce the rules more harshly, or somehow make them even more obvious than they already are. To some, the rules are only a hassle, which is a shame. We'll gladly redirect any users that do not feel like following our rules to an appropriate subreddit for their goal, you just need to ask us. 

If you have any questions, we'll be glad to answer them. I'll take the chance to quickly remind everyone that it helps a lot for to add flairs to your giveaways, which we have tutorials for in the sidebar, and that our NSFW button actually acts as a button to mark the giveaway as complete. It keeps everything a bit more organized for us.

##first let me introduce myself before explaining the giveaway. If you cba with this, just skip to the bottom for the giveaway!


*My name is Dennis, 22 years old and from The Netherlands.
Since recently I got to work for [Gamemuse](http://gamemuse.net), I knew the owner for a long time through online gaming and thats how I got in the team.*

*As the website is just starting up, we need to look for ways to promote our site. This can be done by giveaways for example.
We have been doing some giveaways, since in my eyes, its the best way of 'friendly' promotion.
I can buy some ad space on different websites, and get more clicks than these giveaways (says in calculating, not sure if this is 100% accurate.)*


*But I don't dig that, I rather do giveaways like these. However I know some people do not enjoy giveaways/contest that require you to use social media, like Twitter. I understand them perfectly since I'm not a huge fan of that myself, but since we are in the business that needs 'huge' numbers of followers, to keep up-to-date with our newest releases, Social Media is a MUST.*

*Now our Youtube subscriptions are very low, and we need to boost it a bit, so this is how we do it. I hope you guys can understand our P.O.V.*

Now the giveaway info!

Official contest rules (tl;dr): 

To be entered into the drawings for these games we need your ideas! Please pick any gaming franchise that you think needs reinvigorating. Come up with the title for the new installment as well as a subtitle. OPTIONAL (but it'll help) include a brief description of the new game and how it will stand out from the others.

**Example:**

*Join Leatherface as he moves into his family's farm and tries to get it back off the ground. You'll be able to buy seeds, till the soil, murder drifters, get married, make friends, and harvests the organs of the local townspeople.* (Borderlands)

We'll be picking the one that we like the best.

There will be two winners. **Please include your preferred game out of the two available and we'll do our best to meet your preference if you win**. We'll first pick our favorite and then will do a random drawing and the first name that comes up that requests the other game will win it.

The drawing will be held this Thursday night around 7pm EST and we'll post the winners on the following Saturday afternoon when the 'cast goes live! Please see below for more info:

**UPDATE: ** Thanks to everyone that entered and congrats to our winners!

Asteroid: Revenge
A killer from one of the Liferocks was sent to assassinate our kin, many years ago. Now is the time for our revenge. Adjust your courses to collide with any of his kind that are still out among the stars. It is our duty to protect all asteroid life in this sector, and we will not fall to a laser wielding maniac!

Winner of Borderlands GOTY

Nuclear_Winterfell - Old York

You are a scavenger, a wanderer of the wastes, hired by the Commonwealth's Dr. Madison Li to find anything remaining of one of the biggest and most powerful mysteries of pre-war technology: The Manhattan Project. With citizens of the inhabited boroughs at all-out war, packs of Yao Guai roaming Central Park, a group of super mutants calling themselves the Heirs of the Master and setting up shop in Lady Liberty, and the psychotic raiders' playground at Coney Island... you may just be lucky to get out alive.
Fallout: Old York. Take a bite out of the Big Apple.

You should have your codes waiting for you in a PM!


****************

Please excuse the long explanation. I promise that games are being given away here. For a long time now my friends and I have been playing games and sometimes blogging about them as a hobby. We all work full time and are approaching 30 but decided that it would be a fun project to start a gaming podcast, less for the purpose of trying to aspire to the ranks of the numerous famous and informative podcasts out there but more just so that we have something of a digital record of our little get togethers and a weekly chronicle of our adult lives focusing around the hobby that we all share. 

We draw our influences from Giant Bomb, The Final Score, Video Games Hotdog, The Escapist, Podtoid, Idle Thumbs, Weekend Confirmed, Gamers with Jobs and Player One Podcast. 

Recently we decided that we'd like to introduce giveaways to our show! Because giving away free games makes you feel good! If you have a hole in your podcast rotation, new to games podcasts (there are a lot of them) or just want to win a free game, we'd really appreciate it if you would give us a listen. 

There are so many ways to win! We'll choose a winner whose submission we like the best (we're weird and have kind of a dark sense of humor, so keep that in mind). The second winner will be the first random name we draw that requested the game that the first winner did not win. Does that make sense?

All of the games that we'll be giving away are Steam games that we will send as direct gifts to the winners. They will either be in the form of direct registration keys or we may ask you to message us on Steam so that we can gift it to your directly.

Of course, the podcast is free and so are all of the contests. You don't need to buy anything or give away your email address or social security number or anything! All you'll need to do is post a valid comment in this thread to be entered into the drawing.  Thank you for reading! Most of all we would love some kind of feedback for how to make the podcast better and more like something you would like to listen to every week. Tap X! We are The Quick Time Event.

And 3 lucky winners got the codes. However I personally hate losing in giveaways, so I feel everyone else who entered the last giveaway I did and everyone who didn't should be a winner in this giveaway. It especially frustrated me when I saw people using these beta keys as ways of trading for other games. A beta key should not be used to trade unless it truly cost you money. And for these beta keys, it doesn't cost you a penny. -_-

The codes will not be provided by me, but instead the codes are provided by IGN and Gamesradar. 

Click the following links and follow the instructions (signing up is required for both) and you will be provided a beta key. 

**IMPORTANT IGN INFO** The IGN link says ""Closed Beta"". Ignore that. Just click **GET MY BETA KEY** and create an account or sign into your IGN account to redeem it.

The rules:
Accounts must be at least 3 months old.

Account must have at least 300 karma.

Pick a random Poke'mon from the original 151.  I have one in mind.  It's okay if you pick the same one as someone else, I'll just randomly pick from the correct guessers.  Only one pick per account.

Oh, and upvote for visibility.

Pick will happen on the 31st, my birthday.  Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, RAoG!

I've got LA Noire sitting in my steam inventory, so if it is a game you genuinely want and can't afford it, or can't get it for yourself - let me know.

No accounts younger than a month old without very good reason. If whoever wins this game actually plays it, then I might do some more giveaways - if you don't play it, then I'm done, no more giveaways.

Congratulations to [misterchiba](http://www.reddit.com/user/mistercimba), who explained how he got to his answer in the comments.

I'll be back next week Saturday to post another challenge.

**CIPHER EDIT:**

CIPHERED PASSPHRASE: UIEMQX OEFEX BNHFW NAOBLFMFOY

PUZZLE: 

Who, how and when are your friends.

&gt;They certainly weren't rock stars.

&gt;You wouldn't fly north to travel to them.

&gt;But not to worry, they're gone from here.

Trouble? Say it like they would and be efficient.

**ORIGINAL MESSAGE:**

I’m giving away one copy of ‘L.A. Noire’, a game released in 2011 that I would consider more of an interactive story than any other genre. If you’re a fan of games like ‘Indigo Prophecy’ or ‘Heavy Rain’, this game will be right up your alley.

Here is how the challenge will work[:](http://www.wikihow.com/Create-Secret-Codes-and-Ciphers#Date_Shift_Cipher)

1) On **Saturday (2/2/2013) at 6pm EST**, I will release a passphrase

2) The passphrase will be ciphered using a numeric code

3) The numeric code can be found from a puzzle

4) The first comment after **Saturday (2/2/2013) at 6pm EST** with the correct passphrase will win the challenge.

Only original messages (aka unedited messages) will be considered for the challenge. If you wish to enter another guess, please make a new comment.

The person who wins the challenge will receive one copy of ‘L.A. Noire’ through Steam.

I’m giving away one copy of ‘Magicka’, a fun magic based game that’s best played with a group of friends and funny to boot.

Here is how the challenge will work[:](http://www.wikihow.com/Create-Secret-Codes-and-Ciphers#Date_Shift_Cipher)

1) On **Friday (1/25/13), ~~between 5pm EST and 6pm EST~~ at 6pm EST (New York)**, I will release a steam code that is ciphered

2) The cipher is a numeric code that you will have to discover from a puzzle

3) The first person who can successfully de-cipher the steam code and activate it will be the winner

If you’re the first person to activate the code, post the proof (the activation code) in the comments and I’ll update the post with your name so you can gloat. 

Enjoy!

NOTE: If you are able to finish the puzzle first, you should only post the code **AFTER** you have activated it in Steam. Otherwise someone may just take it for themselves after all your hard work.

**Prizes sent to naranjaspencer, apolotary, and Day_Old_Pizza. Congrats!**

This giveaway is quite a bit different, so please read before you enter.  

I know how it feels to enter tons of giveaways and never win. I've never won on /r/randomactsofgaming or /r/playitforward, and the only giveaway I've won on SteamGifts had 25,000 keys to give away. That's one reason why I saved up a lot of keys before I held my big giveaway - I wanted to be able to give prizes to as many people as possible. That's also why I'm only opening this giveaway to people that haven't won on /r/randomactsofgaming or /r/playitforward before.  

Because of the nature of this giveaway, it will mainly be based on the honor system. I don't have an accurate method of checking with 100% certainty whether or not someone has won before, although I will be doing my best to confirm that the winners are first-time winners. Also due to the nature of the giveaway, the entry requirements will be a bit stricter.  

Now that the giveaway has been explained, here are the instructions to enter:  

* Upvote the post for visibility  
* Write a short description/review (it can be just a few sentences long) about your two favorite freely available games. This includes free-to-play games, browser flash games, emulated games, etc.  
* State which prize you're interested in. If you'd be interested in either of them, say so, although you may want to indicate which you'd prefer.  
* Your account must be 6 months or older, you must be semi-active (i.e. no accounts with 0 post or comment karma), and you must not have won a giveaway here before.  

This giveaway won't be 24 hours, as I can't be up that late tomorrow night (er... morning) due to the SAT on Saturday. I'll leave this open for 18 hours (ending at 8 pm EST) with a 24-hour extension only if absolutely necessary.

Sorry I started this late again today, I'm actually currently typing while in a League of Legends match. I seem to have a pattern going here...  

Anyway, take a look at the previous days' giveaways if you're new here. If not, on to today's giveaway! Today I'm giving away a Machinarium Steam key, a Sanctum Steam gift, and a Beware Planet Earth! Desura key. Since one of today's prizes is a Steam gift, **if you enter for Sanctum, please link to your Steam profile as well**. Here are today's instructions:  

* Upvote this post for visibility – it's common courtesy and part of the subreddit rules, but I'll list it anyway.  
* Tell about (and preferably link to) your favorite free game. It could be download or browser, but it needs to be completely free.
* State which game you're interested in. If you'd be interested in any of them, say so, although you may want to indicate which you'd prefer.  
* Please note that your reddit account must fulfill one of these requirements to be eligible: 3+ months of age, 300+ combined karma, or 3+ game giveaways in this or other subreddits.

As usual, winners will be chosen in 24 hours. Good luck!

24 hours from now (9PM EST tomorrow) I will choose a winner. To enter, make a comment with your Steam ID and a random number between 1 and 1000. Make sure no one else has that number, because the game goes to the person who guessed it first.

Also, don't make the same mistake I did, and be aware that, unlike the console releases, **THIS GAME HAS NO MULTIPLAYER WHATSOEVER!** Please don't enter if you only wanted to play multiplayer. Good luck everybody!

I used random.org and the winning number is **28**. Two people picked that number, but like I said the person who picked it first wins the game. So congratulations **Neoshadow1235**! I will PM you the steam code.

1. Entry must describe why you're interested in the chosen game. No ""give me this game, plz"" entries. Convince me it won't be wasted on you.
1. For the Bundles, please only request one if you think you'll play all/most of the games.
1. Winners will be chosen when this post is ~24 hours old. Pending any real life delays.

1. *Terraria*

1. Dustforce
1. Humble Indie Bundle 6 Extras (includes Wizorb, BIT.TRIP.RUNNER, Gratuitous Space Battles [includes Multiplayer key], and Jamestown)

1. *The Ship* (2 copies) I know, it's old. No one probably wants it. EDIT: Wow, I can't believe how many people are requesting this.

I'd collected a few keys I didn't intend to use over the holiday sales, and I realized if I waited a little longer to have my giveaway, I could make it coincide with my birthday and cakeday, provided I could make it last long enough to hit both days. So I waited and planned and gathered some more games, and today we start the 17-day-long giveaway between February 18th, my birthday, and March 6th, my cakeday.  

In order to get the main wall of text out of the way on the first day, I'll try to describe how the giveaways will work. Each day I'll post a 24-hour long giveaway for a couple of games, along with the instructions for that day's giveaway. Seventeen days of random number giveaways would be incredibly dull, so we won't be doing that. (For those of you that prefer random drawing giveaways, on some of the days I'll also post a link or links to private SteamGifts giveaway(s) when I have multiple Steam keys for a game.) Don't worry, none of the entry requirements will be too difficult – in fact, today's task will be the most difficult of them all. I hate seeing a giveaway for a game I want and not being able to take the necessary steps to enter, so I've tried to avoid that in my giveaways. Each day after the giveaway ends and I've posted the next, I'll look through all of the entries and PM the keys to the winners. If the prize is a Steam gift copy, I'll ask you to link your Steam profile when you enter the contest.  

That's all the general information about the giveaways I can think of, but don't hesitate to ask me questions – I'll edit this post whenever it becomes apparent that more information is needed.  

Now on to today's giveaway! As mentioned in the title, I'm giving away 2 Steam keys for Trine, 2 Steam keys for Metro 2033, and a Steam key for Uplink. [The second key for Trine is on SteamGifts](http://www.steamgifts.com/giveaway/1o4gz/trine) - Metro 2033 can't be given away there, so both keys will be given away here. Today's instructions are as follows:

Of course this is mainly for german speaking people, but you can still try your luck.

A german streamer is actually giving away 300+ games. (misswrote title, lol)

All the games are from random price classes. It goes from Games like ""World of Goo"" to ""Skyrim with all DLC's"" or ""Crysis Collection""

Sounds great, doesnt it? Yes? 

Well, there is still a little problem. You have to speak at least a little bit german.

If not, its way harder but you can still win. 

He randomly chooses people from his IRC chat (#Phunkroyal) with a generator. When you get picked (You'll see the winner on the stream and he will write to you in IRC),  you simply have to write him your steam E-mail back.

As i said, its much easier if you can speak a bit german, but you can still win without speaking it just by keeping an eye on the stream.

He'll most likely give away games until late in the night. (MEZ/CET)

**Edit: Forgot to add Dead Space 2 in the title.**

Here I am with another giveaway, the games are listed in the title.

All you'll need to do is guess the correct number and use this EXACT format - failing to do so will disqualify you - you must include in your comment the number and the name of the game. (You do not need to leave your Steam ID as I will contact you directly if you win).

For example: Psychonauts, 0000.
----------------------------------------------
1. Psychonauts, 1-1000 (2 copies available)

1. Limbo, 1001-2000 (2 copies available)

1. World of Goo, 2001-3000 (2 copies available)

1. Binding of Isaac, 3001-5000 (4 copies available - 2 winners will get the DLC included through a raffle).

1. Bastion, 5001-6000

1. Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, 6001-7000

1. The Longest Journey, 7001-8000

1. Dead Spacce 2, 8001-9000.


You may enter in one game category only. If you apply for more than one, you will be disqualified.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Everyone will be able to join this one, however, as it is a special case:

Whatever package -maximum of 50$- you want, or a donation of 60$ to a charity of  your choice.

All you'll need to do is write something, a joke, a story (nothing depressing), a drawing you did when you were bored, whatever. I'll pick out the comments that catch my attention and write those names in a hat.

In regards to that, I have decided (last minute) to change the format to an overall draw.

I have read through all comments and have enjoyed them immensely; however, the decision was changed in order to make it more fair.

------------------------------------------------------------------

This giveaway will last for 48 hours and end 3:30 am (+0 GMT) on the 24th of July.

All numbers will be generated through RANDOM.ORG and will be posted here for your viewing.

Good luck to all and enjoy! 

Note: Downvoting other people's entries will not be giving you better chances, as I will read through every single comment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Please write in this format: [Name of Game], [Chosen Number] - I will only use these entries as it is the most efficient method for me.**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edit: I will contact the winners tomorrow after I wake up and use RANDOM.org generator. Entries submitted after 20 minutes will not be accepted.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey everyone, not that most of you care but I'm super happy right now as I've just hit 100 subscribers on my YouTube channel! To celebrate I'm giving away 25 games, or $500 worth of games if they were bought on Steam. You can enter either here or on YouTube but please not both! If you enter on YouTube you will probably have a higher chance of winning as less people usually enter. If you enter on the YouTube video the YouTube rules apply, if you enter here then the following rules apply: 1 comment per person, say which game you want and write something about this post, the games I'm giving away, my username, anything related to me or this post! It can be a haiku, poem, pun, joke, pretty much anything! If you want to enter on YouTube a link to the video can be found above.


The games that I am giving away are some of the latest humble bundles. I have one 1C Bundle, which is Men of War, Men of War: Red Tide, King's Bounty: The Legend and King's Bounty: Armored Princess.
I also have 3 Deep Silver Bundles, which are Saint's Row 3, Saint's Row 2, Risen 2 and Sacred 2: Gold. I also have 1 Deep Silver Beat The Average Bundle which is Saints Row 3 with every DLC, Saints Row 2, Risen 1 &amp; 2, Sacred 2: Gold, Dead Island GOTY, Metro 2033 and Sacred Citadel. So there will be 5 winners in all and the top 5 pieces of writing will win! So yeah, good luck and it is very much appreciated if you subscribed to my YouTube channel, but it is not required if you are entering on Reddit.

Thanks, and good luck!

**Giveaway over. My second favorite post millennium RPG is indeed Dark Souls. Congratulations to the winner. More giveaways are coming!**

https://www.humblebundle.com/

Hosting a giveaway to celebrate a huge update on my site with over 130 commits and a wasted vacation...

Full disclosure: I paid $10 for the bundle with the default split.

To enter, all you have to do is guess my second favorite modern(post 2k) RPG. My favorite is The Witcher 2. My second favorite is NOT The Witcher 1. The giveaway will run for 48 hours from the post date. If multiple people guess the correct game then I'll pick one at random.



**Shameless Plug**

Note. You do NOT have to visit my site to enter the giveaway

Visit [Game Magus](http://www.gamemagus.com), we offer personalized recommendations on games to buy on Steam. Login with your steam account and we will analyze your games to tell you exactly what to buy.
You would be a complete FOOL not to trust a computer to pick your games for you, especially one programmed by me.
We also keep track of Steam sales and any running bundles out there on the internet.

**New Features**

* Sort of new design. Considerably less awful this time. Some guy said it was not the worst design he had ever seen, so I take that as a win.
* Steam Profiles
* Steam Signatures. Like [this one](http://www.gamemagus.com/steam_accounts/1620/signatures/large.jpg)

Hello fellow gamers, last week I made a post on /r/steam relaying my thanks for the great deals that had been had, as I am financially hard up as of the last few years. I manage to clunk along on a 4+ year old computer that's done well, but haven't really kept up with gaming. I usually find the best deals, and just hope for Steam's summer and Winter sales. After this this post, users

/u/icw gifted me Crysis 3 and Far Cry Blood Dragon,

/u/FeltchPope gifted me Saint Row 3, Offspring Fling and Basement Collection,

and /u/FiiZzion gifted me Dirt 3, a game I've been waiting to play for a while. 

My budget won't allow my to pay it forward fully, but I managed to scrape up 30 bucks and got 7 games.

Blatently using other recent giveaway styles, I want to make it a bit interesting, so here we go.
 
[The Games:](http://imgur.com/NnklLAY)

Fallout: New Vegas- Winner selected. bantonn- Game Delivered

Portal 2- Winner selected. TheJK314- Game Delivered

Terraria- Winner selected. ElectricEggnog Game Delivered.

Alan Wake- Winner selected. CaelumXV- Game Delivered

Deus Ex: Human Revolution- Winner selected. Li_Tomn_Gimnarf- Game Delivered

FTL- Winner selected. Kobemamba24- Game Delivered

Civilization V- Winner selected. SdBolts4- Game Delivered, Giveaway complete.

All of these are just the core games, I can spread the love better that way.

The Requirements:

Steam user name- I will be checking to see if you already own the game.

Redditor of at least 2 months-- I will be creeping your posts. After seeing /r/badkarma and the banlist, I think the best way to sort out scammers is to see what kind of posts they make. I got a message today begging for a game from /u/threetimescrazy, who has spent all 3 days of his existence begging for games. I am not looking for prolific users, but I would like to see at least a little activity in other subreddits that interest you besides gaming and/or begging for games. I won't judge you for karma whoring jokes and the like, if that's your thing, just contributing somehow will be enough. Racism, bullying, and other negative karma whoring will not do you many favors with me however. I'm sorry this may mean lurkers won't have a real chance to win, but I hate scammers and this is the best way I know of to defeat them, sorry.

I would request that users in the giveaway be those like me who live paycheck to paycheck, (not necessarily in dire straits, you should be more concerned with getting out of trouble), but there's nothing I can really do except ask, as we are in fact on the internet.

That's about it. OK- contest rules:

1. you can request the game you would like to have. Gamers are finicky, I want you to have what you want. If you have a secondary or tertiary choice you may want to list it, if I find your post that awesome you may get second or third. 

2. Picking Winners- 
 I will except any story, piece of art, music related to any of the games listed, even if they are not the game you want. If it's not yours, please note that, and also note I'm on the internet quite a bit. Whorily reposted material probably wont get a win.

Also, if you have a subject you're passionate about, even if it isn't reddit-friendly, I will consider it. Like making models of military aircraft or making beef jerky? Post it, and go for it. I'm an avid comment reader. If you can entertain me with a cool story/song/joke, you'll be considered.

Lucky winners...

* Tomb Raider Trilogy: Riddy86

Hey guys, I've got a (technically) unopened retail copy of Tomb Raider Trilogy (Classics HD collection) for PS3 I want to offload. It was a doubled up gift, so I have no need of it. The seal is broken, but 90% of the wrapper is still on there... the game is unused and technically brand new. The three games included on the disc are HD remakes of Tomb Raider Legend and Tomb Raider Anniversary (a remastered version of the original Tomb Raider on PS1), along with Tomb Raider Underworld.

This is only available to mainland UK addresses because I don't want to pay an arm and a leg for shipping. Please bear in mind I'll be asking for your address if you win so if you're uncomfortable with that, don't play!

Also, I have a gift code for Half-Life 2 on Steam that I've been failing to get rid of for a decade now. Someone, please take it from me. PLEASE. **I BEG YOU.**

I'll select two winners, one for each title, and will announce winners tomorrow.

**Please be sure to include in your post which of the games you would like. As long as you meet the mainland UK restriction for TRT, I'll allow you to state interest in both, but I'll still be picking two winners. Thanks!**

1. I am somewhat of a dumbass. I completely didn't realize it was PC only (I'm on a mac) and I bought it thinking ""GREAT DEAL. I'LL LOVE THIS.""

2. I'm swamped with games in my life and the sooner I get rid of these the sooner I can go outside and look at nature and stuff.

3. I to laugh. And more importantly: I want you to earn it.

Yes. Yes there is. The only way to enter is to have the most upvoted comment in THIS thread. Post a funny PICTURE (no videos; gifs are okay) of something gaming related. The picture or comment ~~with the most upvotes (most popular)~~ **that makes me laugh the hardest** wins the entire bundle (I haven't used any codes at all so it's the whole thing.)

The winner will be announced at 12PM EST on February 15th (So you treat your ladies/fellas right on valentines day).

Good luck!

**UDPATE 1**: Due to a good point about people using alternate accounts, the photos submitted here will entries, and the winner will be the one that makes me laugh the hardest. I'd like to assume that you'll all play fair but I guess I can't be that naive.

**UPDATE 2**: Thank you for all of your submissions! Unfortunately I'm a dirty lying whore and won't be able to announce the winner until later this evening. I'm going through and reviewing all *qualified* submissions and I will announce a winner sometime this evening. Thank you for your patience!

I've come to face the fact that I largely play video games to procrastinate, avoid dealing with real world problems, and escape from a life I am deeply unhappy with.

As bleak as that sounds, there is one thing that I have that I am eternally grateful for: hope. I believe I can have a better life. A life I only dream of right now. There's many things I want to be and do, but video games are just one of the things standing in my way.

I've already sold my custom gaming computer and am just left with my macbook. Unfortunately, all of these games run on macs and, knowing myself, I'll just end up right back where I started.

Instead of destroying these accounts, I've decided to give them away. I want these games to cause others pleasure, because they only cause me pain.

I'd like to simply do a first come first serve basis, but that's against the rules. Instead I will evaluate based on who posts the most amusing dog picture [example](http://i.imgur.com/dOUGmmh.jpg). It can be one you take yourself or one you find on the internet. In addition, please post a list of which game you prefer in descending order. Best dog photo will get their 1st choice, 2nd best photo will get their 1st (or 2nd if 1st is already taken), third best photo will get the remaining game. I'll leave this open for approximately 24 hours. Possibly a few hours more if I decide to go to sleep early.

**EDIT**: contest is over. If you won, you will have received a PM by now.

There are those who will want/need this game more than I do, and will have the [time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOMd7CSt0KU) to do so.

So!

Tell me your stories, write whatever... ~~but in the end, the hivemind decides. Yes, people can just downvote things they don't like, but if someone posts a comment that's just so awe-inspiring that everyone upvotes it, wouldn't it make sense that it'd deserve to win?~~

Thank you again, ArmoredCavalry, for the wonderful gesture. I just thought I would pass along the love.

- Please post the game you would like, and why you would like to receive it. **The more detail the better.** I should add here (ninja edit), that if you could elaborate on why you can't get it yourself - that would help.
- Game can be for any format, but something digitally distributable (eg. Steam) would be easier I guess.

All I ask is that you post a comment telling me your favorite short story, or even one of your own(!) [preferably with a link where I can read it].  

Whichever one is my favorite will get the Bioshock key :)  

I'm going to run it until 12 P.M. Eastern time on June 25th, but if I don't get an overwhelming amount of stories to read by then I might extend that by another day or two.  

**TIP**: I really enjoy dark stories, or horror that isn't ridiculously unbelievable.

Those links have all the info you need about how the giveaways have been going. Today I'm giving away a Steam key for Stellar Impact, two Steam keys for Victoria II, and a Desura key for Paranormal. Here are today's instructions:

* Today I want to know what musician(s) you think should be more popular than they are. They might be foreign bands, artists of an obscure genre, whatever you like – just give your favorites some free exposure that they don't often get. I promise I'll try to stay as objective in choosing winners as I possibly can and not base my opinions on whether the music is something I'd listen to (although since I listen to at least bits and pieces of nearly every genre, it shouldn't be too difficult).  
* State which game you're interested in. If you'd be interested in any of them, say so, although you may want to indicate which you'd prefer.  
* Please note that your reddit account must fulfill one of these requirements to be eligible: 3+ months of age, 300+ combined karma, **or** 3+ game giveaways in this or other subreddits.

**EDIT: winner has been chosen. for personal reasons, submitted the joke by PM. as a Canadian, I approve of this joke: It's Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final, and a man makes his way to his seat right at center ice. He sits down, noticing that the seat next to him is empty. He leans over and asks his neighbor if someone will be sitting there. ""No"" says the neighbor. ""The seat is empty."" ""This is incredible,"" said the man. ""Who in their right mind would have a seat like this for the Stanley Cup and not use it?"" The neighbor says, ""Well, actually, the seat belongs to me. I was supposed to come with my wife, but she passed away. This is the first Stanley Cup we haven't been to together since we got married."" ""Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. That's terrible... But couldn't you find someone else, a friend or relative, or even a neighbor to take the seat?"" The man shakes his head. ""No,” he says. “They're all at the funeral.""**

Guess ONE of the numbers and you'll get a copy of Terraria. 
If a number isn't guessed, then the closest guess will get it.

Needless to say,  only 1 entry per person.

Contest will end at 12:00pm EST on Jan 6 (tomorrow), which is when I will announce the winners. This gives you all 19 hours to guess. Good luck!

Before I continue; this my first time doing this so if I’ve missed something or done something incorrect please let me know and I will fix it. 

So I recently cleaned up my apartment and am throwing out a lot of stuff to make room. I’ve got a few used xbox 360 games that I no longer play and they are merely collecting dust in my apartment as I’ve lost almost all interest in playing them. I figured I’d rather give them away to other  gamers who can put them to good use. 

I’ve packed them all away into a box, they’re all (from memory) in pretty good condition (other than COD 4 – maybe) and most will probably be missing the instruction manual if they had one. 

Ok so here is the deal. If you live in Australia, I can ship to you for free through my work. If you live in the states/overseas, unfortunately I cannot afford to be shipping these games across the planet. However, if you wish to pay for the shipping costs then you’re more than welcome to participate. I spoke to one the mods, he mentioned something about people overseas could pay for the shipping, I could print out the docket/stamp/whatever and post it to them. Either way I’m sure we could figure something out. 

Ok so the rules are: 

-No accounts younger than 60 days
-1 Game per person 
-Pick your game and random number between 1 and 500. Try and make sure your number is unique.  
-If you’re outside of Australia please only participate if you’re willing to pay for shipping!

The games are:

EDIT: **Just realized, as I'm in Australia these games will be PAL region and will not work in some regions (ie. USA).**

EDIT: **I'm picking numbers now. I'll begin sending the winners games out tomorrow and Monday.**

**Bioshock Infinite winner is: BiffWhistler. Congrats Biff!**

**Fallout 3 winner is: karatekitte. Congrats Kara!**

You can make me laugh with anything: jokes, images, videos, etc.. That said, I might give written jokes more of an advantage if they're really funny.

As it says on the sidebar, if you enter, don't forget to upvote!

Winner will be posted sometime around 8 PM EST, Sunday July 14th.

/u/cathepsin 's submission of the video [Bidoof](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec_SguDWWEY)! There's something just so wonderful about this video and I'm not totally sure what it is -- all I know is by the end of this 18-second long video, I'm always cracking up for whatever reason...

Congrats /u/cathepsin, I will be PMing you shortly!

I've just given a few out to friends, family, acquaintances, but everyone has what they want so far, so I figure I’m going to be doing something different here.  A democratic giveaway!  

I’ll be linking a Google Documents form for the giveaway, where you will enter your reddit username, a link to your steam profile, and a choice of which game you want to enter for.  At the end of the giveaway, I’ll do a tally of the votes.  Whichever game “wins” is the pool of potential winners for said game, and then I’ll personally pick out of that pool so long as you don’t have the game already.  So if one game has 20 votes and the rest have less, one of the 20 that voted for that particular game will win it!

I’ll notify the winner via PM in Reddit with their code so that they may apply it to their account and enjoy the game!

And now the rules:  
* Reddit account at least 30 days old as of this post.  
* At least 100 combined Karma.  
* Not already own the game. (I will be checking.)  
* You must post something in this thread.  Whatever you like, just don’t be boring with it, that’s not liable to capture my attention.  
* [Submit this form that will provide your Reddit User Name, Steam Profile link, and what game you would like to enter for.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bzIRWjmOYO5RXLuOEQh__AR6y7ae8epLwt1XKhZH9zk/viewform)  
* **IMPORTANT** If you can NOT enter on the form for any reason, please post with your Reddit User Name, Steam Profile Link and what game you would like to enter for in your comments.  I will manually add you to the giveaway.  
* Duplicate entries will have all but one disqualified, once you submit, there will be a link to edit your vote, you may want to save this in case you change your vote.  
* Ultimate winner will be chosen out of whatever group receives the most votes, for the game that received the most votes.  
* The use of the form has been approved by the Mods, and they are involved in the process and have access to the forms.  
* All info supplied via forms will be completely deleted upon the end of the contest.  
 
And now the games and Tallies!:  
* Anomaly Warzone Earth  - 0 Votes
* Aquaria  - 3 Votes
* Binding of Isaac + Wrath of Lamb DLC  - 16 Votes and WINNER!
* Closure   - 3 Votes
* Cogs  - 0 Votes
* Crayon Physics Deluxe  - 1 Vote
* Dungeon Defenders + All DLC  - 12 Votes
* Indie Game: The Movie   - 5 Votes
* Legend of Grimrock   - 7 Votes
* Metro 2033  - 13 Votes (BOI took this over near the end)
* Nightsky  - 0 Votes
* Offspring Fling  - 0 Votes
* Shank 2   - 6 Votes
* Snapshot   - 0 Votes
* Splice   - 3 Votes
* Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP  - 7 Votes (This had an early lead though!)
* The Basement Collection   - 2 Votes
* Waking Mars  - 3 Votes

If this goes well, I’ll do this again once in a while until they are all gone.  

Remember, you only have a shot if you select whichever has the most votes at the end.  So I encourage you to campaign for your favorite, or use subterfuge to get people to vote for less popular ones so you have a better chance.  I’m interested to see how this little “experiment” works.  I may do something similar or different for the rest of the keys in the future, but hopefully this will be a fun first giveaway for me!

**Today I'm going to continue [the weekend's giveaway](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/19ibuu/17day_birthdaycakeday_giveaway_days_13_and_14/) because there were fewer entries than prizes – you can still enter there, and as a thank you to anyone that already entered, the people that entered during the weekend can enter again with a second entry I'll count separate from the original. I'd like to get at least twice the individual people enter as there are prizes to give away, so I still need 18 entries. Hopefully bringing up that giveaway again today will get some more entries.**  

Anyway, on to today's giveaway! Today I'm giving away a Steam key for Off-Road Drive, a Steam key for Death Track Resurrection, and two Steam keys for Sugar Cube Bittersweet Factory. Here are the instructions for the giveaway starting now:  

* Upvote this post for visibility – it's common courtesy and part of the subreddit rules, but I'll list it anyway.  
* Today all you have to do is state your favorite pre-2000's console and why it is your favorite. You don't need to have owned the physical console – games played on an emulator count. If you've never played any older games (I'm not sure who hasn't, but I want to include everyone), just say what console you wished you'd had.  
* State which game you're interested in. If you'd be interested in any of them, say so, although you may want to indicate which you'd prefer.  
* Please note that your reddit account must fulfill one **(only one is necessary)** of these requirements to be eligible: 3+ months of age, 300+ combined karma, **or** 3+ game giveaways in this or other subreddits.  

As usual, winners will be chosen in 24 hours. Winners for the weekend's giveaway will be chosen in 24 hours as well. Good luck!  

**Congrats to Chelate, Misanthrope3, Codyjmcd, and djbosio14! I hope someone went back to play their old console after telling me about their favorite. :)**",,True,,t5_2t5mo,1362460168.0,,,True,t3_19mdl8,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/19mdl8/17day_birthdaycakeday_giveaway_day_15_offroad/,

Rules: One entry per user. Guess a number between 1 - 500. I'll use a random number generator to pick who wins. Whoever is closest to the number without going over (Price Is Right style) wins the key. The winner will then be PM'd with the key.

The game can be fairly demanding, so please check the game's [Steam page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/203160) for system requirements before entering.

To enter, simply tell me why you want the game.  Some sort of emotional attachment to the series? Can't afford it? Your cat wants to play it? Anything goes - it's more of a random drawing than anything.  I'll decide the winner in about 24 hours, give or take a few.

Note: The winner will be given my Steam name to contact me to get the key.  I'll be verifying that the winner's account doesn't already have the game and is more than one day old (not an account created just to get the key and resell).

**Edit:** 5 hours in and this already has about twice as many entries as I expected to get in total.  I have 5 consolation prizes (they're leftover keys from humble bundles, so think smaller/indie games) that I'll be handing out.  It'll be one per person (I'll send messages to find what each person prefers/doesn't already have), so six winners total.

**Edit 2:** Holy crap, so many entries!  I'm compiling the names into a list now and will have a script choose the winner.  I really didn't expect this many entries and thought I'd be able to pick one, but it's to the point where so many of you sound like you'd really enjoy it that I'd feel bad about all the people I can't pick, so I'm leaving it up to the randombot.  **I'll be adding new entries to the list until 6PM PST** (about an hour from the time of this edit), at which point I'll announce the winner.

**Edit 3:** And the winner is /u/randomguitarlaguna!  I'll be contacting you with my steam info in just a minute.   *You have until Monday to get ahold of me, or I'll give the game to someone else*.  Shortly afterward, I'll pick the winners of the consolation prizes.  Later tonight I'll be putting up a giveaway for Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, so keep an eye out for that!

I have one key to give away. Simply tell me what you had for dinner last night and I will make my decision based on that, 12-24 hours from now.

edit: So I looked a little more closely and this key is for both Alan wake games (collectors edition for the first) plus bonus content such as videos, comics, behind the scenes, etc. Just thought I would let you know.

edit 2: One thing I am learning from this is that a lot of people eat much better than I do on a random week night. I am quite envious of many of you.

Those links contain all the info about the previous days. This giveaway is a tad different – I'll be away this weekend, so I'm combining the two days into one 48-hour giveaway. Also different for this giveaway is a request for ideas for the final day of the giveaway coming up this Wednesday. I don't really have any great ideas, so I thought I'd see what you guys wanted me to do. The final day will be big, with more keys given out than any other day of the giveaway, so I want everyone to enter and have fun. Now, on to today's giveaway!  

* Upvote this post for visibility – it's common courtesy and part of the subreddit rules, but I'll list it anyway.  
* You have two options to today's entry: 1) Post a photo of the weirdest/creepiest/oldest object in your house, or 2) Create an MS Paint (or similar alternative program) interpretation of any video game you like. This could mean drawing a character, a setting, etc. Don't worry about drawing skill so much as creativity.
* Please give your suggestion for what should be done on the final day of the giveaway. This is not required, but it is helpful to me.  
* State which game you're interested in. If you'd be interested in any of them, say so, although you may want to indicate which you'd prefer.    
* Please note that your reddit account must fulfill one of these requirements to be eligible: 3+ months of age, 300+ combined karma, **or** 3+ game giveaways in this or other subreddits.


*Not* as usual, winners will be chosen in 48 hours. Good luck!

I bought the Torchlight 2 (4x) pack a while back expecting me and my coop mates would get round to it, unfortunately we have not, and with the rate of games we manage to turn over with working schedules and etc, this is probably never going to happen......

So instead I'd rather donate the last unused copy to some person out there who would like to play instead of it sitting and collecting ""internet dust"".

Only requirement is that you give me a good reason why you should get it, and if its a good one, then it's yours :)

Delivery will be via a Steam gift.

Giving away 1 Bioshock Infinite key for steam that came with my graphics card. [proof here](http://imgur.com/DDO40Yf)

What I want hopefully isn't asking too much and should only take a few seconds for one of you internet sleuths out there. Apologies for using you guys for my own selfish purposes with this, but I'm hoping that it is all within the rules and has a good enough reward.

In Australia, it is almost impossible to get guitars at a decent price. I am looking for one in particular [B.C. Rich Mockingbird Pro X Hardtail Shadow](http://www.bcrich.com/images/guitars-and-basses/Pro-X-Mockingbird-Hardtail-PXMHS.jpg). It is pretty common and is all over eBay for ~$USD 700, but the postage to here kills the price.

I want it in new or as new/showroom condition and will be buying it. Postage to Caulfield, Melbourne, VIC, Australia (Postcode 3162).

If you are able to find the cheapest place for me to get it, and provide a link or reliable information by 7th May 9PM AEST, you will get a copy of Bioshock Infinite! If the winning entry is chosen more than once, I will give it to the person who suggested it first.

*Edit: Removed the $650 threshold for new/showroom condition, now the lowest price wins. Also accepting 2nd hand offers to mix things up a bit. At the end of the competition, it will be at my discretion whether to choose the winner from the the new or second hand offers. I have moved this contest and couple of entries from /r/playitforward, as I was told that was the wrong subreddit*

**I WILL BE GIVING THE GAME REGARDLESS WHETHER I END UP BUYING THE GUITAR OR NOT**

*Edit 2: Sorry for the confusion, the much cheaper BC Rich Mockingbird Limited Pro X 2 is a completely different guitar. The one I want has diamond inlays, while this one has arrows.*

Now then... In order to participate in this giveaway, make a comment including:

* What is your favorite animal?

* Do you prefer Alan Wake Franchise, Awesomenauts, or doesn't matter?

I will choose winners randomly and check if they have fulfilled the 2 criteria above. I will try to give winners their preference of games. I will disqualify accounts that do not have any posts outside of RAoG. This Giveaway will end around the June 27 at 5pm CST. Good luck! Thank you to those who wish Clyde well!

If you are anything like me, you will have fond memories of the good ol days (by that, I mean the 80s). And what better way to relive the glory days than playing a nostalgia filled game like FC3: Blood Dragon?! Its a PC download, so this one is for all you PC gamers out there. I will choose the winner by the following:

Tell me what you think the best thing of the 80s is and why. This can be anything from a fashion trend, to a song, to a movie. But it HAS to be from the 80s. And remember, defend your statement! For instance, if you're going to tell me that Alf was the best thing to come out of the 80s, you better give me a damn good reason why (that bastard creeped me the Hell out).

There you have it folks. I will be choosing the winner at 15:00 PST (in the US...if you haven't figured that out already) on Thursday. If you already have the game/aren't a PC gamer I ask you upvote this so others that may want to win have a chance. Good luck you little Gremlins!

EDIT: So I will be traveling to Santa Barbara tomorrow at 13:00, and I will probably not be able to mark this thread as COMPLETE by 15:00. But it WILL be done by then, and I will announce the winner here (and also PM them of course) when I get a chance to. But there is still time! Keep up the submissions guys, definitely feeling the 80s love!

A few quick notes:

* All games are through Steam and Steam alone
* I do not work for RedditGifts, but I think they are fancy pants
* SOOO... Confession time. I thought June 10th was Arbitrary Day. I was very wrong. TURNS out. That is just the deadline. The real day is on the 25th. I just figured out this today. Basically, I have been counting down to the deadline day, as opposed to the actual day. 

**UPDATE** Very very VERY hard time figuring out the winners today. You guys had really incredible stories, and I just want to thank everyone for sharing their tales. It was a lot of fun. 

Here is the winner list:

* 1st Prize (Batman Bundle): [cisrulez](http://www.reddit.com/user/cisrulez) for essentially turning Minecraft into Home Alone with **SPOILER** a tragic end.
* 2nd Prize (Indie Bundles): [gutrunks](http://www.reddit.com/user/gutrunks) for their epic light sabre battle.
* 3rd Prize (Three Tokens): [twell99](http://www.reddit.com/user/twell99) for their story in CoD:MW2 where they barely came out alive and went from zero to hero in their friend's eyes.
* 4th Prize (Two Tokens): [friedchickenbiscuits](http://www.reddit.com/user/friedchickenbiscuits) for their League of Legends experience. As a sports fan, I cannot tell you how rare something like that is. To literally give up your win for the enemy team. 
* 5th Prize (One Token): [MeowZhuxi](http://www.reddit.com/user/MeowZhuxi) for FINALLY get that achievement in ODST. When do something like that for the first time, you always need some luck, and man, he got lucky that day.

We have one copy of Spiral Game's new game Orion: Dino Horde set to giveaway.

[Part 2](http://youtu.be/if07LUSxNKc)


So, here's how this will work. Post your favorite dinosaur themed movie and a number between 1 and 1000. On Friday (May 3rd), we will announce the winner and message him his key for the game to be activated over Steam.

Until then, this was Actatus (who is posting as Gandah for reasons to be discussed at a later time) signing out.

Edit: Alright, and with that the giveaway is over. Congrats to /u/FDeschanel! We hope you enjoy your copy of Orion: Dino Horde. We'd like to thank everyone for participating, and for all of you who watched our videos and subscribed, thank you so much. With your help we might be able to secure more keys for giveaways in the future. 

As an interesting note to wrap all of this up, it'd appear that the #1 dinosaur related film comes from the Jurassic Park series, followed by the Land Before Time series. So there's that.

I have a Payday 2 beta key and an extra copy of Postal 2 that my buddies aren't too interested in, so here's your opportunity!

~~To win the Payday 2 beta key, guess a number between 1-2000.~~

~~To win the Postal 2 key, guess a playing card (standard deck of 52 cards, no jokers, 4 suits ♥ ♦ ♣ ♠). If nobody guesses the exact card, whoever guesses the closest value of the same suit wins it.~~

I have already predetermined the number and card (the imgur .jpeg file name starts with P, followed by a number), and I will reveal the winning card/number the first time I log in this weekend. I will PM the winners for their Steam info.

You may submit both a playing card and a number. Contestants should have an account at least one month old or with activity in other sub(s) prior to this post's submission.

""Edit"" 1 + 2: ~~Once someone picks the right card and/or number, I will update the post saying that is has been claimed.~~ Winners will be announced when this post is roughly 36 hours old. Here's a screenshot of my Steam inventory for 'proof': http://i.imgur.com/VRnOmMr.png

Edit 3: The closest number guess (as of 12:20AM PST) is ~~9~~8 off. Got a winner for Postal 2.

Edit 4: Giveaway is finished! [Here's the predetermined card and number, the 3 of Hearts and the number 79.](http://i.imgur.com/P5n4Il1.jpg) Congratulations to u/jdmousley for being the first to pick the 3 of hearts, and u/EulerTheToiler for being closest to 79, with a guess of 87.

Thank you all for participating in this event, I will be sending a private message to you as each winner picks a game starting with jollysaintpete!

* Dear Esther. Now I don't know much about this game other than you explore a world. I hope someone could shed some more light on this!

* ~~Capsized. Again don't know much about this one either, but a quick research on it it shows that its a side scrolling adventure game.~~ Given to /u/glhwcu

* ~~Tiny and Big in Grandpas Leftovers. The title alone sounds confusing! I tried looking at some gameplay couldn't get much info on it~~ Given to /u/EPICyazan

* English Country Tune. Looks like a puzzle game, got some good reviews. If you like puzzles you may like this one!

* ~~Red Faction Guerrilla. Now a lot of people know the red faction franchise and just how great it is. This takes it to a whole different level. Everything is pretty much destructible, you can level towers, buildings, houses you name it! You can destroy bridges, create new paths by breaking down walls or hell even breaking down a pipeline to sneak up on the enemy! The game can give you many hours of entertainment alone just by using the sledgehammer and bring things apart. Did I mention its open world?~~ Given to /u/NoXiDj

* ~~Red Faction: Armageddon + DLC. Now unfortunately I don't know much about Armageddon only because I never played it. I'm going to be honest here, everything I heard was that it was nothing like Guerrilla, not as much destructible environments, linear and I hear the story isn't relevant to the previous game at all. All though there are people out there who still enjoyed the game.~~ Given to /u/runefar

* ~~Darksiders. Now this game, man oh man this game. I love this game to death, it's pretty much Legend of Zelda with a taste of God of             War, the combat is very fluid. You can upgrade weapons, have different items for different situations you can combo some items with others in combat to get a higher combo. You really can't go wrong with this game at all.~~ Given to /u/jollysaintpete

Just a quick little giveaway, I'm giving away FTL!

**Requirement to win:** Tell me about your favourite game! :)

I'm giving away two copies from the Humble store, so you'll have the game both DRM-free and on Steam.

**Winners have been chosen!**

I actually chose Three people to give the game to, instead of only two people! 

Here are the winners and the games they suggested:

/u/sepherian - For suggesting the game ""Nightsky"". I had never heard of this game before but it looks pretty amazing! 

/u/NateMacaque - For reminding me of the ""Trine"" series! I remember being super hyped for them when they came out, but for some reason I totally forgot about this series.

And then there the extra winner. I added this guy as an extra because the moment I finished reading his posts I was sold. The game he suggested got me extremely excited, and I just had to reward him before the time was up! I didn't think that would be fair for you other guys though, so I bought an extra copy just for him :P

/u/globebiscuit - For suggesting the ""Stalker"" series! I just can't believe I've never heard of these games before, but they look absolutely *perfect* for me! Definitely a game that I just know that I'm going to enjoy a lot.

This was a dozen times more difficult than I thought it would be. So many more people use this subreddit than I had expected! And only a fraction of them were joke posts or duplicates, too. You folks found some truly majestic horses, and I'm sorry that I have only one code to give away.

Let me be clear: There were a *lot* of really good entries. I've been keeping up with the submissions, and over the past quarter hour I went over them again, and I was forced to choose the best one, but first, the runner-up:

http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1k7ezg/giveawayxbox360skyrim_full_game_code_no_dlc/cbm4gvx

One of the earliest submissions, and it was so amazing, I was almost afraid nobody would be able to top it, but after much nail-biting, I decided this one was truly the best:

http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1k7ezg/giveawayxbox360skyrim_full_game_code_no_dlc/cbm7n0r

The entire way the image is put together is just so perfect, the pose of the horse, the positioning of the sun and ground, the taller part of the horse being on the left but the mane and tail blowing to the right to give the image horizontal visual balance...it's just perfect in every way I can see.

I hope the rest of you who submitted excellent images are lucky enough to win your next giveaway. Take it easy!

*-*-*-*-*

I bought myself an Xbox 360 last Christmas, and it came with a scratch-off code for a Skyrim full-game download that I haven't used since I own it on PC. It does not list any expiration date, so it should still be valid.

To win, you must link me to an image of a horse looking majestic in some way. The image does not have to be made by you: Just a link is fine. The image must be clean (i.e., not mating or other nonsense). It must be a photograph, though it can be an edited photograph.

The winner will be chosen by me based on how awesome I think the image is. *This is purely a subjective determination based on my personal taste, so don't enter if you think that's unfair.*

Included in this deal is a mystery game, of which I have three picked out so there's a good chance you haven't played it. 

The last giveaway I did here was for Bioshock and Bioshock 2. It took a lot of effort, and people complained that I was asking too much for games that are lackluster. I was really offended by that. I was asking people to listen to Taylor Swift songs and find a wallpaper of her and stuff, simple things that should have taken all of ten minutes. If you've read this far in, make sure to capitalize a word somewhere in your post where it doesn't belong. This is the first rule. So this is the last chance I'm giving this subreddit, and I hope you can restore my love of giving away free games. I picked the Humble Bundle for a reason. It's not a AAA title. It doesn't cost much. It shouldn't be about how much or how new a game costs, but about sharing games with people who can't afford it. That's also why I included the mystery gift. You may have to do an hour's work just to get HIB7 + Dead Pixels. Or you may be getting HIB7 + the Bethesda package. You should be having fun doing these crazy things, that's what it's all about! 

**THE RULES**

Here's three albums that I really, really love. Find a cover from a song from each of them, and post the youtube links. 

The albums are **My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by Kanye West, For Emma, Forever Ago by Bon Iver, and Speak Now by Taylor Swift.**


Make up (like just post what's in it) a trail mix, using at least **one fruit, one nut, and one candy.**

I currently have **Sleeping Dogs, The Walking Dead, Dishonored, and Spec Ops: The Line.** Which should I play first, and why?

Post an **adorable otter picture.**

And last, find a game on /r/GameDeals that's **under $15 and Steam redeemable.** Then find a gameplay video on youtube that shows me why I should buy it. 


**THINGS TO REMEMBER**

The game on /r/gamedeals isn't gonna be the mystery game. Neither are the games that I've recently tried to buy from /r/gamesell. Nice try though :)

The more effort put in, the better your chances of winning. This is how I pick who wins, it's NOT random.

I'll be picking winners around 10 AM EST.

Disclaimer: I would like to keep karma and kind words out of this type of posting because I'm just not comfortable with it, thank you. The idea here is to HELP someone who otherwise couldn't obtain one of these and I will not send this otherwise. International shipping is tricky and expensive so it's CANADA ONLY (sorry). The item is in good working order and is not stolen.   

Offering: 1 modded psp 2000 with 8Gb memory stick. Comes with usb cable, charge cable, no proper case, and one aggressively minor scratch on the screen that's not visible during play.

Games on memory stick: God of war - Ghosts of Sparta, Silent hill - Origins, Pixeljunk Monsters, Mod nation racers, Little big planet, Grand theft auto - chinatown wars, Echochrome, snes9x euphoria and nesterJ (not every emulator ROM works).

I'll make a decision around lunchtime Saturday to give people a fair chance. I hope I can find a good home for this guy.

****************

Please excuse the long explanation. I promise that games are being given away here. For a long time now my friends and I have been playing games and sometimes blogging about them as a hobby. We all work full time and are approaching 30 but decided that it would be a fun project to start a gaming podcast, less for the purpose of trying to aspire to the ranks of the numerous famous and informative podcasts out there but more just so that we have something of a digital record of our little get togethers and a weekly chronicle of our adult lives focusing around the hobby that we all share. 

We draw our influences from Giant Bomb, The Final Score, Video Games Hotdog, The Escapist, Podtoid, Idle Thumbs, Weekend Confirmed, Gamers with Jobs and Player One Podcast. 

Recently we decided that we'd like to introduce giveaways to our show! Because giving away free games makes you feel good! If you have a hole in your podcast rotation, new to games podcasts (there are a lot of them) or just want to win a free game, we'd really appreciate it if you would give us a listen. 

All of the games that we'll be giving away are Steam games that we will send as direct gifts to the winners. They will either be in the form of direct registration keys or we may ask you to message us on Steam so that we can gift it to your directly.

NOTE: This game requires Steam, and does have some minimum system requirements in order to run.

As the title says, I happen to have an extra key lying around, as the Humble Bundlers are at it again. I'm going to refrain from blatantly posting the key until I see that this holds at least some interest among you people. Beyond that, I'm not sure what I'll do...hell, if nobody's interested, I'll just post it and let one lucky gamer be happy.

If you want this game, please leave a comment (link, etc.) to show your interest.


NOTE: I goofed, I do not in fact have 4 guest passes to RO2, I have 2 guest passes to Killing Floor and 2 for RO1. The four runners up should post their ID""s and their preference, I will not mediate that so talk amongst yourselves on which you'd be okay with.
Alright, after much delay, my final count on the comments is 76 (disregarding my own comments, of course).

The grand prize winner is: badwyrm! Post your Steam ID so you may claim your prize.

Our runner-ups are: DaFuzzDog, thefatpig, Killerninja_254, and fartloud73!

The winners will have until tomorrow midnight (remember, I'm CST) to contact me about their respective prizes, after which I will re-roll and award said prizes to other participants. My Steam handle is KILL3R FURBY. It would be best to contact me via Steam or these comments.


Thank you to all for participating, and for welcoming me to the community. Rest assured this is not the last you will see of me.

All will be Steam keys.  The games are as follow(separated by keys):

-key for Wizorb, BIT.TRIP.RUNNER, Gratuitous Space Battles, and Jamestown 

-key for Snapshot

-key for Binding of Issac w/dlc

-key for Closure

-key for Bioshock 2

-key for Shank 2

-key for Homefront

-key for Darksiders, Red Faction: Armageddon, Metro 2033, Company of Heroes w/ dlc

To enter I just ask the following:

-That you have been a member of Reddit for at least 3 months.

-That you have at least 200 comment karma

-that you have a steam account and are able to use these keys

-Also, to enter you must include in your comment about a positive Christmas memory involving videogames.  Well, doesn't have to be just Christmas since not everyone celebrates it, basically just a happy videogame memory that happened in a December.  It can be you receiving, giving, or buying for yourself a game/system/pc/etc.  Just something that really brought you joy that you can remember from the past or something that happened recently.  I also ask that you are truthful, I don't want to see any obviously fake entries that are just trying to be crude or I may disqualify your entry.  Please be positive, thanks!  I will post with a couple of my memories as well for example or if anyone feels like reading them.

I also ask that you do not own the majority of these games before entering.  Now, since there is quite a variety of games that I'm sure some of you will already have, I am willing to split the keys if the winner already has it or doesn't want it.  So if someone wins but they already have the thq bundle games and they don't want shank 2, I will then go ahead and do another drawing for those keys until all keys are given away.  Please be honest, thanks!

The contest will end at 12/24/2012 at midnight PST. That should give enough time for people to enter. At that point, as soon as I can I will take all eligible entries and then randomly select for the winner.  The winner will be contacted by PM ASAP about the gifts.  I ask too that if you know you will not be available at all to check your messages around those times that you do not enter.  If I do not hear back from the winner within 24 hours after I send my PM, I will have to pick another winner instead.

Anyways, good luck to all!  Any questions or comments feel free to let me know.  Thanks!

EDIT:  Just to clarify, the giveaway drawing is for ALL of the keys.  If the winner, for whatever reason, does not want certain keys, then I will do another random pick.  It is not a separate drawing for each key.  Also, I enjoy all your posts so far!  Plenty of awesome comments so far and I have more to read!  Thanks again for posting!

EDIT 2:

Thanks again everyone, so far lots of awesome entries!

As I read through a lot of these entries, which I have enjoyed all of them, there was one poster that stood out to me. It wasn't just the story he shared, or his awesome name (LostRonin), or that others seem to have enjoyed his story as well.  Just something about this guy seemed very cool.  So I thought I would message him and I told him since he is so short of karma, that unless he reaches it by the deadline that he will be uneligible!

Okay so I also told him that even though I will not include him in the contest, I will go ahead and give him some other Steam keys I have.  Since he had none of them I gave him Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War, Snapshot, Closure, Binding of Issac, Shank 2, Metro 2033, and Warhammer Space Marine.  

For some reason when I was looking through this giveaway about an hour ago on my phone, he just stood out and I checked out some of his recent posts and he seemed like a cool guy.  Though I can't give games to everyone, I just thought I would go ahead and give this guy some games.  

Anyways, thanks for sharing that awesome story, LostRonin!  I hope you enjoy the games and continue to contribute to Reddit and be awesome.  

For everyone else, the contest continues as normal!  Still got a couple more days till it ends, good luck!

EDIT 3:

Okay contest is now over.  I have done the random drawing and the winner is:

duqq!!!

Thanks again to everyone.  I am now contacting duqq to see if he is passing on any of the keys.  If any keys are left I will do another randomized drawing and will contact that winner.

EDIT 4:

Duqq has claimed his prizes and passed on the thq key since he already had it.  I did another drawing for the Darksiders, Red Faction: Armageddon, Metro 2033, Company of Heroes w/ dlc key and that went to:

advocatus221!

Advocatus221 is are runner up so I am sending his key now.  Thanks again duqq, advocatus221, and everyone else for playing!  Enjoy the holidays!

I'll throw my shit out there so I don't seem like someone who isn't being honest when it comes to giving out free shit.

Keep it simple, throw out a crazy story could be true could be fake.

Doesn't matter, we're going for content.

Now don't get ahead of yourself and think, Oh jeez I gotta impress this man.

Nope I'm no judge, to be honest I really want something to read through whilst at work tomorrow and figured this could be our trade-off.

Sound good, if you said no well ok you can still win the game even if you have no story, lack a complete creative imaginable mind, and have no good faith to throw a brotha a quick story to get a measly chuckle out of. More importantly a glimpse of wisdom from a fantastic display of courage and wit.

There were no winners. Sorry, everyone. Congrats to those who stuck with it the hardest, though. To prove that there is a real solution, I'll explain everything.

Let's look at the hints. The first three are fairly straightforward, so I'll start with hint #4. Each line of text is an anagram for a hint. In order: This is a hint. Notice how this is scrambled. The key will help you unscramble. Good luck. (/u/piknless was the first person to get this). In order to get anything out of this, you must look at how the letters are scrambled. In the first line, the first letter of the first word is the first letter of the scrambled hint, the first letter of the second word is the second letter, the second letter of the first word is the third letter, and so on. ""Hi me"" would therefore become ""Hmie"". Of course, you may have realized the problem with this; it doesn't work with words of different lengths. If I were to unscramble ""Hmeey"" (""Hey me""), there's no clear direction as to where ""me"" ends and ""hey"" begins. This is where the keys (numbers) come in. The beginning of hint #4 says ""Keyless"". The lack of keys is the only thing making the unscrambling difficult. Hint #3 says ""The numbers are the keys."" Keys are necessary because they indicate how long each word in the unscrambled sentence is.

Let's look at the anatomy of a key. The slashes have no significance; they only serve to separate the numbers. The first number in each key represents the total number of words in the sentence. Each subsequent letter represents the length of each word, in order. ""Hey me"" would have a key of 2/3/2: 2 words, the first word has 3 letters, and the second has 2. ""I see you"" would have a key of 3/1/3/3: Three words, the first has one letter, the second has 3, and the third has 3.

So, here's a step-by-step on unscrambling. We'll use ""PBptooouoplxleilnce"" (key of 5/6/3/4/2/4) as our example. First, set up 5 boxes, since the first number tells you that there are 5 words. You no longer need that first number, so just ignore it. Now, for every letter in the scrambled text, add the letter to its respective box. The first 10 letters would give us boxes of ""Po"" , ""Bo"" , ""pu"" , ""to"" , ""op"". According to the key, the fourth box has all of the letters it needs. Now, anytime you should add the letter to box 4, just add it to 5 instead. Repeat this process until all boxes are filled according to the key and you have no more letters left to assign. You should have come up with the solution ""Police Box pull to open"".

By now, you should be close to the solution. Skip the next paragraph if you don't care about the other hints.

Hint #5 is only useful to people who understood the keys. As you probably guessed, the dots and dashes stand for morse code. Hint #5, when translated, tells the reader to use the ITU standard of morse code. There is nothing tricky about the ITU standard, I just wanted to avoid confusion when people got to that step. Hint #6 tells you that the first number is the only one that has any relevance to the others in the series, which is true, since it is equal to the number of subsequent numbers. Hint #7 is where I started to run out of clever hints. Pronouncing the sentence out loud would (hopefully) sound something like ""The only purpose of the morse code is the increase the entropy of anagrams."" This is absolutely true. You could find the riddle just fine without the morse code. As you can see, hints 5-7 only served to push you closer to finding out how keys work.

So, if you followed all of the steps correctly, you should be able to turn each line into morse code that can then be translated into a riddle.

* I remember a world of grass and stones,
* created from the source's bones.
* I saw a chamber of the orient grand,
* in which a window revealed strange lands.
* On an island lit by beacon's glare,
* the hopes of madmen and plague's despair,
* a letter from a dying love,
* wandered by the lonely dove,
* sits a concrete cabin candlelit,
* beyond the reach of watery pits.
* Inside this cabin, a glowing scrawl.
* Tell me, what was written on the wall?

I'm holding another contest for that riddle (and Bioshock) [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1cbala/giveawayriddle_bioshock_1/). The first person to solve the riddle gets a copy of Bioshock. Thank you to all who participated! Your efforts are commendable. For those of you who are interested, I wrote a script in Python to encode and decode with this method. You can get it [here](http://pastebin.com/nw9cVaCZ). It's a very, very rough script, since I'm just a bored high schooler with a manual, but it should suffice.

Shoutouts to the people who got the furthest: mrbfowl, Piknless, Batman_Von_Suparman2, Baoum, and Blinkroot (and his friends!). Good job, guys!

---------------------------------------

Below is an encrypted riddle. Decrypt the riddle, solve it, and PM me the answer over Reddit. One winner will be randomly chosen from the correct submissions. I will send the copy of Bioshock over to the winner's Steam account. In order to be eligible for winning, your Reddit account must have at least 100 comment karma and be at least 3 months old. I will choose a winner ~~on April 7th~~ April 15 (I have to allow time enough for a few people to get this).

**HINT #1:** The riddle is related to video games, and the answer is in one.

**HINT #2:** The encryption can be easily translated by hand if you understand how it works.

**HINT #3:** The numbers are the keys to the dots and dashes. Once you understand the numbers, you will understand the rest.

**HINT #4:** Keyless:

* Tiahhsiinst.
* Nhtisoohsctwirisacmebled.
* Tkwhyuheieoneyllusslpcramble.
* Glouocdk!

**HINT #5:** This will only help those of you who have figured out the encryption. You should translate with the: 23/2/1/3/1/3/1/2/2/3/2/3/3/1/2/3/3/3/1/1/4/3/3/1 **|** .-./.-.--..-/--.../---....-..--.---..-.-....-..--..

**HINT #6:** The only number in each series that has any relevance to the others is the first number.

**HINT #7:** The only porpoise of the horse toad is to tin grease the hen's troppy of Anna's grahams. (As you can see, I'm running out of clever hints).

Here is how this is gonna work: I want you guys to post a link to a good Hard Rock song. Something Van Halen style (obviously from a different band though). If you don't like Hard Rock, just give me a really good song, if you think I'll like it. 

The one that sends the best song (in my opinion) will get Red Faction: Armageddon + DLC, then I'll randomly pick someone else to win Red Faction: Guerrilla.

If you want, you can just comment anything to try for Guerrilla, but then you have no chance on winning Armageddon + DLC.

EDIT: Okay guys, I just chose the winners. lchen2104 got Red Faction Armageddon + DLC thanks to that GREAT Lindsey Stirling girl. resisting_a_rest was randomly chosen for Red Faction Guerrilla. Congratulations for the winners!

I would also like to say thanks for everyone for introducing me to great music.

Those links contain all the information about the previous days of the giveaway. Today I'm giving away two Steam keys for Dungeon Defenders and all the DLC (many thanks to tablloyd for donating a copy!) and a Steam key for Cities in Motion. Here are today's instructions:

* Upvote this post for visibility – it's common courtesy and part of the subreddit rules, but I'll list it anyway.  
* Today your challenge is to create a piece of art in Minecraft using only 10 wool blocks (any colors) and 10 wood blocks (any combination of planks, logs, slabs, etc.). There's no theme for the artwork – be creative! Create whatever you wish. For those of you without Minecraft, you can play [Minecraft classic](http://minecraft.net/classic/play) for free without an account; you can press B to access the rest of the available materials, including wool. Please take a screenshot of your art and upload it to post in the comments. All the slimes jumping around my superflat world made me decide to make [this](http://i.imgur.com/4oBGpaX.png).  
* State which game you're interested in. If you'd be interested in any of them, say so, although you may want to indicate which you'd prefer.  
* Please note that your reddit account must fulfill one of these requirements to be eligible: 3+ months of age, 300+ combined karma, **or** 3+ game giveaways in this or other subreddits.


As usual, winners will be chosen in 24 hours. Good luck!

**Compose a limerick, about your favorite game.** It must adhere to the form, as follows... It's really quite easy, just follow the form (and compare to my example if you're in doubt)

&gt;Typically, the first two lines rhyme with each other, the third and fourth rhyme together, and the fifth line either repeats the first line or rhymes with it. The limerick's anapestic rhythm is created by an accentual pattern that contains many sets of double weakly-stressed syllables. The pattern can be illustrated with dashes denoting weak syllables, and back-slashes for stresses:
&gt;
&gt;1) - / - - / - - /    *rhyme 1*

&gt;2) - / - - / - - /    *rhyme 1*

&gt;3) - / - - / *rhyme 2*

&gt;4) - / - - / *rhyme 2*

&gt;5) - / - - / - - / *rhyme 1, or repeat first line*

Example of a limerick I wrote about my favorite game:

&gt;The Borderlands are very vast

&gt;I kill skags with a lot of class

&gt;My graphics card died

&gt;I shut down and cried

&gt;My time to play games has now passed.

Since I already own Civ IV and I'm not the kind of person to try and use an older game as a ""bartering"" chip on Steam for other stuff, I'm going to make this available to someone here.  Per subreddit rules, I will choose a winner on 7/13/2013 at 10:30PM CDT.

To enter, merely explain why you want a copy of this game.  Only reddit accounts older than 2 months will be considered and your words will play a large factor in my decision, but don't feel the need to write a novel if not interested.

Good luck and happy gaming.  My first time doing something like this on here, so if I did something wrong, I apologize.

Edit 1: I'm going to have 2 copies of Civ IV to give away!  One of my friends gifted me his copy for this cause and I'm going to ask another tomorrow.  So at minimum, 2 lucky winners!

Edit 2: Going to bed for the night, but we have 3 confirmed copies for tomorrow.  Keep the comments coming.

Edit 3: Thanks for all the comments.  I'm going to PM the winners and I'm going to stop this a little early because the rules are only 12 hours, not 24.  It's things like this that make reddit my absolute favorite site and after lurking for quite awhile, certain things made me finally create an account a few months ago.

We all think it's time to get a fresh look for the sub. Initially I was going to have this be a ""Mods only"" kind of thing. But, being that I created this Sub for YOU guys, I want you in on it's look. I have a template image [**here**](http://imgur.com/kId6rkq) that you can use. (Special thanks to /u/bennysc for his [submission](http://redd.it/1fv6jv) to my recent [Giveaway](http://redd.it/1fv6jv). 

You can also use [**this**](http://www.reddit.com/about/alien) to help you get started as well. (Special thanks to /u/totallygeeky for finding this one)

Now you can use that as a template for the Snoo image if you like, or make something completely different. The template is just a base for ideas for everyone. You can change ANYTHING about it. Keep in mind we want a Snoo-Banner combo. Preferably a combination that will blend well together. I would like the color schemes to keep a blue aspect to them. *The whole blue color spectrum and what have you.*

This will be a two round event. The first round will take in all submissions over a 5 day period **(Updated ending time)** (Ending Tuesday at 12pm EST *subject to change*). Once the deadline hits no further submissions will be accepted. From those submissions the mods will choose an appropriate number of ""finalists"". From those finalists a pole will be made for all /r/RandomActsofGaming users to vote on. Whichever scheme has the most votes will be declared the winner and will be applied to the sub for the next 6 months.

***

**Requirements for entry**

* 1: BE A /r/RandomActsofGaming SUB!

Yeah, that's it. No age or karma restrictions on this one.

***

**What we are looking for.**

* 1: A new Snoo image that is appropriately themed for this Sub.

* 2: A new Banner image that matches the Snoo image.

* 3: We would prefer the blue scheme to remain, but this is not set in stone.

* 4: Try to make your Snoo and Banner images transition smoothly from one to the other.

* 5: No ""Console"" themed images please. We are looking for something that covers the spectrum of gaming. 

***

**What will be rewarded**. *Other prizes may be added later on.*

**1st:**

* [Anomaly: Warzone Earth](http://store.steampowered.com/app/91200/?snr=1_7_15__13) *Steam Key I purchased for this contest*

* Custom flair. (Image or text)

* Special mention in the sidebar until the next contest.

* Header mention for several weeks after the contest is over. (If you want.)

**2nd:**

* Custom flair. (text only)

* Special mention in sidebar.

**3rd**

* Custom flair. (text only)


***

That is all we can offer for now. However, if this is a success we will definitely be doing it again and offer prizes for the top three entries. **We will accept donations for prizes if any user wishes to add them.**


That's it! I really look forward to seeing your entries and I really hope we get a lot of participation on this one.

As such, one of the rewards is exclusive beta access for those who manage to promote the game. I'm giving away a few games in support of the giveaway. All you have to do is sign up by following **[this link](http://signup.europauniversalis4.com/r/55297516491)**.

The first two games that will be given are **King Arthur: Fallen Champions** and **Warlock: Master of the Arcane**. Both are unlockable Steam codes. Posting here makes you eligible for these games, they will be given out within 24 hours, you don't have to follow the link above if you don't want to. (It would really help if you did though)

Beta access would help out the EUIV community immensely. If the beta NDA allows it, I will be giving out screenshots, videos, details about the game to other EUIV fans. Along with the games listed above, I will be creating another giveaway when Europa Universalis IV preorders are announced. Posting here will make you eligible for these games as well. 

* Europa Universalis IV preorder (STEAM code)
* Victoria II (STEAM)
* Victoria II: A House Divided (STEAM)
* Victoria II: Heart of Darkness (STEAM)
* Crusader Kings II (Gamersgate gift)
* Crusader King II: The Old Gods (Gamersgate gift)
* March of the Eagles (STEAM)
* War of the Roses (STEAM)

There are some other rewards for the promotion. As I am only looking to use the beta access for providing screenshots and videos, the rest of the prizes will be given out to posters as well if it is within the scope of the promotion. If not, I will purchase the prizes if possible and give them out. Those are:

* EU4: Winged Hussar DLC
* EU4: National Monuments DLC
* Europa Universalis III Chronicles
* First 50 will get name in credits of EUIV
* First 3 will get a trip to Stockholm to play against the developers

Enjoy the giveaway. The above link goes to the affiliate account, [this](http://signup.europauniversalis4.com/) brings you to a normal link if you want. Hopefully this will also bring people to discover the great games that Paradox Plaza makes.

1325556526.0,31,self.RandomActsOfGaming,o0jcy," [GIVEAWAY] Possibly the BIGGEST steam giveaway / contest on reddit ever! Over 150 games!
",43,12,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/o0jcy/giveaway_possibly_the_biggest_steam_giveaway/," **PLEASE READ THE INFORMATION BELOW BEFORE SUBMITTING [THIS FORM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDUwNW1BS09NR1FXVEtjYUNUS21tcEE6MQ)**

Welcome, everybody, to our great Steam game giveaway!

We will be giving out many games in this upcoming contest / giveaway.  This might even be the biggest and most ambitious PIF ever, with over a hundred different games of all varieties.  We see random giveaways like this pop up on reddit from time to time, and through pure luck and/or timeliness, some people get lucky.  We decided to do something different; something that will give YOU, the participant, direct control of your likelihood to win one or more of our games.

------------------------------------------------------

**Here is how it works:**

Below, you will find a list of achievements and the points that they are worth.  You may complete as many or as few of the achievements in this list as you would like, up until the submission deadline of 11PM EST, January 5, 2012.  At  this time the form will be pulled from the web and we will go through all the entries to award points.

In the event of somebody really blowing us away with an attempt at an achievement, we will invite them to participate in a mini-game similar to ""Deal or No Deal,"" where they can win up to an additional 3000 points.  The timing of this event will be decided upon with those who are invited.

If the achievements are not your style, or you don't have the equipment to complete our achievements, you can opt to take part in the trivia challenge instead. In the trivia, invitation to participate in the mini-game will be given out based on good behavior, involvement, attitude, etc.  The trivia will take place on 8 PM EST, January 6, 2012.

Finally, any points you have earned will be multiplied by a super secret multiplier. And on 11PM EST, January 8, 2012, a list will be posted online containing the usernames and point totals of all the participants. 

------------------------------------------------------

**List of Achievements**

For all the achievements, your submission (image / video / audio / text) MUST contain the date of submission and your reddit username either spoken aloud or held up on a piece of paper.  You may mask your face if you choose.

* 100 - Upload a picture with a shoe on your head.


* 100 - Upload a picture of your best duck face, in a washroom, taken with a cellphone (if possible), with toilet/bathtub visible.


* 100 - Upload a picture with 5 food items in your mouth at the same time--all visible.


* 300 - Upload a picture of  your pet, prepped for combat with body armour and/or weaponry.


* 300 - Upload a full upper body picture of yourself, wearing at least 4 t-shirts backwards (not inside-out), clearly showing the layers at the neck or sleeves.


* 300 - Upload a picture of yourself wearing an eye patch and pipe.


* 500 - Video clip upload of entrant singing any song from [this list of 10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0Bb3IG1Yv8), or playing one of these songs on an instrument. The username of the entrant must be spoken at the beginning of the clip.


* 500 - Upload a picture of your full body covered in tinfoil. (Only eyeholes, nose hole, and mouth hole.)


* 500 - Upload a picture of your hand immersed in toilet water.


* 0 - 1000 - Provide proof of something selfless you have done. (Points awarded at the discretion of judges) 

------------------------------------------------------

**Trivia**

Round 1: 50 Questions
First correct answers to each question are worth 100 point.
5 Question point ceiling of 500

Round 2: 30 Questions
First correct answers to each question are worth 300 point.

**Prize Distribution**

This distribution will be in the format of an auction over steam group chat.  Games will be announced on (DATE TBA)  from a sizable list one by one and you may bid on them with the points you have accumulated.  The amount of games you walk away with is limited only by your points.

[Click here to join the steam for the distribution](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway/)

Please consider adding the other subreddit to your list.  

The list of games are nearly identical, yes, this means I'm giving away two copies of each of the following games:  

* [Bastion](http://store.steampowered.com/app/107100) (on Steam)
* [Orcs must Die](http://store.steampowered.com/app/102600/) (on Steam)

* ~~[Xenonauts (in alpha)](http://www.desura.com/games/xenonauts) (on desura)~~ RushofBlood52 chose Kenshi instead. He got his preference, and I saved myself a couple bucks. 
* [Fallout](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/fallout) because it's dirt-cheap on gog.com and a lot of people don't know how the fallout series started
* [Beyond Good and Evil](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/beyond_good_and_evil) (downloadable from gog.com)

and unique to this list:  

* I have a few physical games that I'm never going to play (again), that I can post to someone in New Zealand/ Australia. This list isn't complete, as I'm not at home right now, but it includes: Starcraft 1 battlechest, Alone in the dark trilogy (1, 2, and 3), Afterlife, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Vegas 2, Sim Tower, Myst, Uru: ages beyond Myst, American McGee's Alice, Homeworld: Cataclysm, Aura, no-one lives forever 2, theme hospital, discworld (no idea which one), quake 3 arena, pharoh, lighthouse,  (*most* of these come with manuals - and gosh did they know how to make a good manual in those days)- which you can ask for as many as you want to help me save on postage, and I'll chuck in some CDs I haven't listed, just for kicks and giggles.

A couple things to note:  
*You can apply to one thread or the other, but not both*  
*Specific rules apply to each subreddit, read the sidebar for more info*  
*I'll edit this a bit, and start giving away in 26 hours, so you have plenty of time*


**What do I do to win?**  
Just reply with up to two of the games you want (but at most you'll receive one), and a link to your steam community page (even if the game is on desura or gog, just to make sure you aren't a scammer). Ideally it would look something like this:  

I'm interested in Bastion, or Fallout 1 if Bastion gets taken.

Official contest rules (tl;dr): 

To be entered into the drawings for these games, please write ""Johnny Phantom for Mayor!"" as a comment in this thread. This is the first giveaway that we are doing for our games podcast, The Quick Time Event. We plan on doing one most weeks if we can. The drawing will be held this Thursday night around 7pm EST and we'll post the winner on the following Saturday afternoon when the 'cast goes live! Please see below for more info:

**Edit**: Thanks to everyone for entering! We're no longer accepting entries as of 6/20/2013 12:01AM. The drawing will be held tonight and the winner will be announced on Saturday, along with a new contest!

**EDIT 2**: We have our winners! Congrats to HamLis for winning Hotline Miami and to fwinest_JediThug for winning Legend of Grimrock. I'm contacting you both via private message now for delivery :D

****************

Please excuse the long explanation. I promise that games are being given away here. For a long time now my friends and I have been playing games and sometimes blogging about them as a hobby. We all work full time and are approaching 30 but decided that it would be a fun project to start a gaming podcast, less for the purpose of trying to aspire to the ranks of the numerous famous and informative podcasts out there but more just so that we have something of a digital record of our little get togethers and a weekly chronicle of our adult lives focusing around the hobby that we all share. 

We're only in our 14th week so far and we're learning new things every time. We still have plenty of room to improve but I like to think that a point of pride for us is our audio quality. Personally I really enjoy working with audio and, though it is hardly perfect, I like to think that the sound is pretty darned close to listenable. We draw our influences from Giant Bomb, The Final Score, Video Games Hotdog, The Escapist, Podtoid, Idle Thumbs, Weekend Confirmed, Gamers with Jobs and Player One Podcast. (I have a long commute and I like to run) 

Recently we decided that we'd like to introduce giveaways to our show! Because giving away free games makes you feel good! If you have a hole in your podcast rotation, new to games podcasts (there are a lot of them) or just want to win a free game, we'd really appreciate it if you would give us a listen. The instructions for how to enter into the giveaway are in the latest episode (#14 - White Glove Services... Our E3 special!) Since there is basically no one listening right now you have a really great chance of winning a game the first few rounds. 

There are two ways to win currently. You can tweet the pass phrase like we detail on the show and be entered into the Twitter-based drawing for Hotline Miami. Or you can comment the pass phrase to be entered to win the reddit-exclusive drawings for a different copy of Hotline Miami or Legend of Grimlock!(I just want to make sure that this does not violate the rules for this subreddit. If it does, please let me know and we'll change the rules of the contest.)

All of the games that we'll be giving away are Steam games that we will send as direct gifts to the winners. (Usually they will be ones that we ourselves have picked up on sale. We like the idea of giving away games but we're not super rich or anything!)

Of course, the podcast is free and so is the contest. You don't need to buy anything or give away your email address or social security number or anything! All you'll need to do is tweet a certain code word or post it as a comment in this thread to be entered into the drawing. If this is a success and people like it we might make this a permanent fixture every week. We're thinking about not just indies here but AAA titles as well! Thank you for reading! Most of all we would love some kind of feedback for how to make the podcast better and more like something you would like to listen to every week. Tap X! We are The Quick Time Event.

We are eight days away from Arbitrary Day 2013. If you have not heard about it, find out more [here](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/arbitrary-day-2013/). To get people into the ""holiday"" spirit, I thought it would be fun to do 10 days of giveaways.

The unique prize for today is Indie Bundle III from Steam (it includes [Insanley Twisted Shadow Planet](http://www.gagneint.com/itsp/itsp_main.htm), [Darwinia](http://www.introversion.co.uk/darwinia/), [BIT.TRIP BEAT](http://www.aksysgames.com/bittripbeat/), [Bunch of Heroes](http://www.bunchofheroes.com/) and [Runespell: Overture](http://www.runespell.com/) PLUS two of these ""virtual"" tokens that I have made up. These tokens will let you get something out of the ""token box"". Some games will be worth 1 token, others are worth 2. The token box items are first come first serve, so do not hesitate in responding if you win :D. 

Today, I want to know what character you fell in love with in a game. Whether it was a character you played as or an NPC OR even the villain, I want to know how and why they won your heart. My three favorite submissions will win! (Quick note: Warn if it is a spoiler)

The contest will end at 11am (EST) tomorrow.

1st place: Indie Bundle III + Two Tokens

2nd place: Two Tokens

3rd Place: One Token

A few quick notes:

* All games are through Steam and Steam alone
* I do not work for RedditGifts, but I think they are fancy pants
* Is it acceptable to use shower loofahs as a guy? They don't scream manly, but MAN are they useful.

**UPDATE** Wow... You are guys are awesome! Really good entries in here! It was really difficult narrowing it down to just three. I have said this before, but, if you have no read the submissions, definitely do it! Alright... It was difficult, but these are the winners I have come up with:

* 1st Place (Indie Bundle III + Two Tokens): [crazyrich](http://www.reddit.com/user/crazyrich) for their Booker DeWitt story (Major Bioshock Infinite spoilers, just in case you were going to read it)
* 2nd Place (Two Tokens): [WiggerWithAttitude](http://www.reddit.com/user/WiggerWithAttitude) for their tragic love story of the NCR in Fallout: New Vegas
* 3rd Place (One Token): [RowieMonster](http://www.reddit.com/user/RowieMonster) for their love of Wilson from Don't Starve. This is a great example of when you stop caring about you and start caring for someone else in a game. It isn't about wanting to get to the next checkpoint, finding the next upgrade, or achieving a highscore, it is about going out of your way for a character to succeed and you put your ""wants/needs"" aside.

Again, I cannot state this enough, excellent EXCELLENT submissions! You guys are awesome!",.,False,,t5_2t5mo,1370983006.0,Steam,,True,t3_1fl9rt,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/comments/1fl9rt/countdown_to_arbitrary_day_2013_day_3_love/,

I have a Steam key for XCOM: EU that I have been sitting on since preordering Bioshock Infinite on GMG.
