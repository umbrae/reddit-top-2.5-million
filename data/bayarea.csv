Every time we have something big going on, they are able to pull a catering order at the last minute to help feed our crews and donate it all. They were there for the San Bruno fires, they were there when we flew people out to New Orleans to help out, and this past weekend, They were there to feed us for the SFO plane crash. About a 90-120 minutes after it happened they had 20+ pizzas ready and at our building to feed all the people working and that came in on there day off to help out. They also told us if we needed more to just give them a call. So thank you Toto's pizza!

1328222200.0,511,self.bayarea,p8cyg,Stood Naked at California &amp; Montgomery to Protest Hate-Mongering Christians - Director of HR Walked By,734,223,175,http://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/p8cyg/stood_naked_at_california_montgomery_to_protest/,"I was just coming back from lunch in the Financial District when I saw some crazy hate-mongering christians standing at the corner of California &amp; Montgomery screaming at everyone around that they're going to hell.

I attempted to converse with them about their position, but they didn't really want to answer, so I waited patiently. I started to get bored, so I figured I'd do what any reasonable person would do: get nekkid.

I took off my sweater, shirt, and unbuckled my pants, letting them fall to the ground. I wasn't wearing underwear. I just stood there in front of the protesters waiting for them to answer my questions.

This went on for about 10 minutes. A couple of people offered encouragement, a LOT of people took pictures, and I explained that I was simply showing the 'Christians' what sort of obscene spectacle they were making.

On the way back to my office, the Director of HR was sitting outside and asked me to come sit, so I did. She asked what I was doing, I said I was having a conversation with those christians. She asked ""a naked conversation?"" to which I replied ""well, I was naked, but they weren't.""

She asked me why. I asked her if it was relevant to my job. She asked me if it was relevant to my job. I said it's not relevant to my job. She said okay, I stood up, and went inside.

Am I going to get fired?

Here are the original planning documents:

* Here's a [1961 map showing the proposed Travel Times between different stops](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5057/5423961825_2d5af7cef4_o.jpg). This is the map that most clearly shows off the planned routes at that time.
* Here is the [San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District General Map, February 9, 1961](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4051/4394101782_091e061238_b.jpg), which shows in detail the planned routes.
* A similar map, [San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District General Map, June 6, 1960 Routes](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4103/4948160089_a660741b62_b.jpg), with an alternate routing through the Mission
* A [map updated with the Marin line removed](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5211/5430312770_26c5ac8d11_b.jpg) from September 1961 and showing the MUNI Rail connections
* [1962 map showing the first and possible future stages of BART](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4109/5410803865_6300f13435_b.jpg) with ""possible future connections"" as far out as Livermore, Antioch, San Jose, and Novato

If you're interested in hundreds of similar planning maps, I'd recommend checking out [Eric Fischer's photostream on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/), where he collects all sorts of similar documents about the Bay Area.

1371231636.0,231,self.bayarea,1gcmso,Regarding the young man who was murdered this week (link is currently top post of this sub),267,36,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/1gcmso/regarding_the_young_man_who_was_murdered_this/,"Hello /r/BayArea,

As many of you saw, a 22 year old man Aya Nakano was killed the night of 6/12/13, one hour before his 23rd birthday. I was one of his best friends and I feel like everyone should know a little more about how he lived.

I know this gets thrown around a lot, especially during a tragedy, but Aya was truly the kindest and most gentle guy you will ever meet. He was able to walk in any group of life and bring these seemingly random groups together to have an amazing time, all tied together through Aya. Aya was one of the funniest guys I know, always with a huge smile on his face and cracking everyone up. Not a single person who knew Aya disliked him, it was impossible to. 

Aya has a beautiful soul, filled with kindness, love, joy, and humor. He was the Bay Area sports fan I know, especially with the Warriors (although he loved the Niners so much). Without a doubt the biggest Warriors fan in the entire Bay Area. No matter what our record was, ""this is our year. Keep the faith"".

His outlook on life was full of optimism and positive energy. He wasn't without struggles in life either, but he faced each of them head on and with the same infectious energy and happiness that everyone who knew Aya was touched by.

The only thing keeping us going right now is remembering the endless positive times we have shared with Aya and how much joy he brought to everyone who knew him. I'm trying not to think about how we lost him or just how fucked up and shitty this world can be, because Aya wouldn't look at it like that. 

Sorry for the rant but I think everyone should know how amazing Aya was and how special he was to all who were lucky enough to know him. I for one am truly blessed to of had Aya in my life and to be able to call him one of my best friends.

Did I miss any?

I think it's great that they've created a sense of community by treating r/chicago as a central hub and jumping off points for all the other discussions and specific interests, and it seems to be working great for them.  Since we're such a far-flung and diverse region, it seems like this kind of philosophy would work even better here.

What do you guys think?

(Full disclosure: I am a mod on r/oakland, and I have asked for a link to our little community on r/bayarea and I've been told by a mod here unequivocally that [that is not going to happen](http://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/jvdo5/lets_spice_up_the_bay_area_alienheader/c2feuj8) but I would be very interested in the thoughts of the larger community.)",,False,self,t5_2qjyy,True,,,True,t3_jy35j,http://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/jy35j/heres_a_list_of_every_bay_area_subreddit_enjoy/,

1338469329.0,143,self.bayarea,udsiq,Anyone else seeing suddenly abysmal data performance with AT&amp;T iPhones in the Bay?,157,14,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/udsiq/anyone_else_seeing_suddenly_abysmal_data/,"I started noticing this on Saturday or Sunday - my iPhone (a 4G with the ""grandfathered"" Unlimited plan) can only intermittently pull down any data over 3G. I initially suspected it was just my phone acting up (former Apple Genius here), so I did a full restore and new setup, but the issue persisted. Now I'm getting the same question from all of my AT&amp;T iPhone-using friends in the Bay.

Anyone else seeing something similar? I don't believe I'm being throttled (no where near the 5GB cap for the month), and I'm hearing similar reports from non-Unlimited iPhone owners too.

**UPDATE:** Spent nearly two hours on chat session w/ AT&amp;T support tech. Explained that I've already reset settings, performed full wipe, etc. They requested that I do all that again (which I did while grinding my teeth). No change of course. Finally, after ages of restarts and tinkering, the tech asks me to confirm my IMEI - the one he had in his system was completely different than what I actually have. After updating that and a final reboot I now have full speedy 3G access again. If you are seeing similar problems, I *strongly* suggest that you have AT&amp;T confirm your IMEI matches against what your phone actually has!

**UPDATE 2:** Annnnd... it's dead again. FML. Not remotely sure what to do now.

**UPDATE 3:** 2nd chat session with AT&amp;T rep (""Dale"" this time) confirms - AT&amp;T is having major infrastructure issues around the Bay. Their official advice: ""Keep rebooting your phone and call in to check."" He advised me to call the sales number and request a bill adjustment for the days with degraded service. Yay. Sprint or Verizon, here I come!

**SUGGESTION:** I would strongly encourage you all to call or chat to AT&amp;T Support to confirm that you are also having these issues. The last rep I worked with was trying to ""make a case"" to management that this is impacting large numbers of people.",,False,self,t5_2qjyy,1338498928.0,,,True,t3_udsiq,http://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/udsiq/anyone_else_seeing_suddenly_abysmal_data/,

NNEB happens in Oakland on the last Monday of each month. At each event, three different experts each give a 20-minute talk on some nerdy topic or another, while the audience drinks and revels in the nerdery.

We've had some amazing talks so far -- on topics as wide-ranging as black holes, Oakland history and competitive rock-paper-scissors strategy. We always welcome science-related talks, but we're interested in all forms of nerddom. A good Nerd Nite topic is something you're passionate about, and it has some humor as well as a scintillating bit of 'surprising complexity.'

[Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=qXgX2WErXQo) an example of a memorable Nerd Nite talk (From NN New York).

Reddit, please help figure out what this is and if need be stop it!",152,25,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/13llvg/signs_of_possible_human_trafficking_occurring_in/,"In the last 6 months or so I have seen a woman wearing a headscarf begging for money with a small child in her arms. I have seen her outside of post offices, supermarkets, banks. etc. many times over the last few months while I was out running errands. I have seen her in Mountain View, Campbell, San Jose, etc. The woman is always wearing middle eastern style clothing with a headscarf and has a baby or toddler in her arms and a sign begging for money. 
A friend of mine ran into her recently at night and it was really cold and windy. My friend told the woman that if she is out of the street in the cold with a baby that she could help her secure a place in a shelter right away. My friend told the lady that she could use her cell phone and that she would help her call the non emergency police line to help her out right away. Now here is where things get strange. The lady starts making strange hand gestures and says ""no police, no police!"" and then a man in a nice black Mercedes swoops up and the woman and baby jump into the car and he drives them away. This was a few weeks ago and I haven't seen them since. But I posted about this on some other city boards and other people who have seen her told me that when they made an effort to look for the Mercedes they noticed it near by. I haven't seen them since my friend had the interaction with the woman, but other people online have recently in the South Bay. I have also been informed that it is a few different women all wearing the same type of clothing with different small children and babies. 
What REALLY has me worried is that this has signs of human trafficking written all over it. One man in a nice black Mercedes, different women and children begging for him on the street while he watches. It is possible that these women are enslaved and trying to pay off a debt to be in this country or who knows what. Either way it is really disturbing and I am scared for these women and children. PLEASE if you see them go to a place where they can't see you and call the police and tell them about the Mercedes near by and that there are possibly victims of human trafficking that need help.

For the next 21 years the good Emperor's proclamations and daily works spread peace and tranquility among the citizens of our fair city and beyond while his visionary insights, unfortunately revealed before the time at which mankind could appreciate their brilliance, yielded both our international diplomatic system and regional infrastructure as we now know them. How fitting, then, that the UN should be ratified in the Emperor's city! And how villainous the venal Oakland Board of Supervisors, who has denied the good Emperor his due by acquiescing in the simple act of dedicating the new Eastern Bay Bridge span to Emperor Norton I for his key role in making the Bay Bridge a reality!

Today, raise a glass to Emperor Norton I, so that his name and deeds will never be forgotten. And forever keep in your heart Norton's 1872 proclamation that the use of the ""abominable word 'Frisco'"" shall be forevermore interdicted. While the good Emperor did not expressly provide for the use of deadly force in support of this interdiction, in these woeful times I believe such authorization must be understood as both implicit and necessary.

Discovered about 5 blocks from where it was last seen, parked illegally on the sidewalk. No damage, as far as he knows never even started. And yes, the first thing we asked if he was just drunk or didn't remember where he parked it. But the answer is no. He doesn't park on the sidewalk and there's always parking for a bike on his street.

So basically, it was either an attempted crime or some drunks who wanted to push it a few blocks away (most likely the case). Always lots of bar-goers around that block.

But my buddy says thank you to /bayarea and wanted to spread the good news so he didn't get tackled off his bike if you saw him around. haha

Thanks again!

He was a major voice on one of San Francisco's major radio stations for most of my life. I grew up with Gene Burns on the radio and even had the chance to call in and speak with him a few times. He was always very well informed about international events, but I always appreciated how in touch he was with local Bay Area news and events as well. His dining around program was a fun look into the restaurants and destinations in the city and up north around wine country. He was always kind and level headed.. A trait I feel many hosts lack. 

Just wanted to say a piece about a guy I really enjoyed listening to during commutes on weekdays. You will be missed Gene!

We do stuff all the time but I'm only posting events that don't have personal info associated with them (unless it's mine or they've ok'd it), so if you're looking for smaller outings join the group. If you're nervous about coming out or have specific questions PM me.

**June 23 Global Meetup**
http://redditgifts.com/meetups/grmd-san-francisco-2012/


**July 7th Scavenger Hunt**
We received so much positive feedback from the last scavenger hunt that we just couldn't wait to create another one. So here it is!

Show up on Saturday, July 7th at 4:45 pm in Mission Dolores Park in San Francisco (we're meeting at the corner of 20th and Church near the J stop). We'll give you a list of missions that will test your knowledge of the city, your ability to plan, work as a team, and google keywords. If you're new to the city or want to make new friends I can guarantee that you will know new people by the end of this event.

You'll spend the evening finding historic locations, live clues and local businesses throughout the Castro and the Mission districts. The team who solves the most clues in the allotted time will receive $125. 

You can choose between buying an individual ticket and letting us pair you with a team or, if you have a full team of five, you can buy a team ticket. 

After completing this race, each team will meet at Churchill for an after party. 

RSVP here: https://www.wepay.com/events/sf-scavenger-hunt-the-mission-and-the-haight (ignore haight in the link, I really wanted to go home when I made that.)

New things:

You have the choice between creating a custom team or being placed on a really fun, awesome team of random people that we create. A couple of people requested custom teams because they wanted to bring friends/co-workers/family who also wanted to meet new people but didn't want to be split up. But, we can not help you complete a team, if you need 1 or 2 people to fill out a team try posting in IRC, on Facebook or reddit. 

The price has changed- it's $4. Costs were just covered last time (only because of cookies) and a few awesome changes will make this scavenger hunt slightly more expensive to set up.

We'll have live people as clues, as well as point to point clues. 

If you do not want to participate but want to help out we are looking for volunteers to be live clues or guard clues to ensure they are not damaged or stolen. Email me at amylukima@gmail.com

**Trivia- Wednesdays, South Bay**
*What*: Trivia!
*Where*: O'Flaherty's Pub, 25 North San Pedro Street, San Jose
*When:* 8pm, but come earlier if you want a chair (or let me know!)
*How to find us*: Probably going to be sitting in the dining room
area, on the left as you come in. If in doubt, go up to tables and say
""I'm here for the gangbang"" until you find a group that doesn't recoil
in horror.
*What else to know*: Parking at the garage across the street is
effectively free, since the bar will validate for anyone who orders
food/drink.

**Rock Climbing- Thursdays, South Bay**
Every Thursday, we climb at 7PM at Planet Granite in Sunnyvale, and then afterwards at around 9PM, we head out to Bon Chon Chicken in Sunnyvale for some Korean Fried Chicken (chicken be crispy like you've never SEEN).  If we end up staying late, we may go to 99 Chicken in Santa Clara.

If you're new to climbing and want to top-rope with us, let one of us know so we can sign you up for a belay course, which is completely free for you (you get gear, all day pass, and training).  If you just want to boulder or have already taken the class, some of us also have guest passes available, so let us know and we can sign you in.  If you're in either category, try and make it 15 minutes early so we can sign you in and get you geared up.

Most of us don't carry our phones with us whenever we climb, so if you get here and don't see any awkward redditors, just ask the front desk to call our names (you'd probably have better luck calling either - Narin) 

**Rock Climbing- Wednesdays, San Francisco**
we'll be meeting at Mission Cliffs this Wednesday for climbing.

If you are a first timer and want to do top roping, make sure you come in time to take the 7:30 belay class. Afterwards we will have 25 cents victory wings at Dr Teeth &amp; the Electric Mayhem, anyone who can finish 2 of those death wings gets a beer from Ke or me. 

If you have trouble finding us, I'll be in a bright red Che Guevara-esque shirt

    Will this help make me more manly? Yes, after 4 months of climbing I started wrestling grizzly bears.
    Will this help make me more girly? Yes, Ke uses rock climbing as an alternative to foundation AND mascara.  And he's very pretty.
    I'm nervous, or shy, or poor, or I have some other poppycock reason not to come, should I still come?  Yes, studies have shown that you're exactly who should come.

It was around 6:35pm. I had just left work in Union Square, and luckily a co-worker and I managed to snag that perfectly timed train for my short ride home.
As the SFO bound train pulled into the 16th &amp; Mission station, I noticed that the passengers closest to the doors started to speak in panicked tones, and gather around the window. As I got up from my seat and had a look for myself, I realized why.

On the other side of the station at least a dozen or so SFPD and BART Police officiers appeared to have surrounded an extremely agitated individual. The BART train opposite my own was also on the tracks, locked-down. I'm guessing it's passengers must have had a crystal clear view of what went down.

As the doors opened, myself and a handfull of other passengers stepped out of our car, only to realize how serious the situation actually was. Between the yellow tiles by the parked BART train, and the last staircase out of the station, a pretty serious standoff was happening. The loud and distinct rack of a pump action shotgun pierced the air as the growing number of officers rushing to the scene all drew their weapons on the perpetrator. Surrounded, and hopelessly outgunned - I heard suspect screaming ""Fuck you!!!"" back at the cops, while things continued to escalate.

The panic in the air was thick as the small crowd of bystanders all ran in opposite directions from the scene. Many fled for cover back into the train cars - those who could darted back towards the other sets of stairs. Many were watching behind cover, filming with their smartphones. That many cops screaming at a guy who's screaming back - weapons drawn (specifically the shotgun slide) told my guts to immediately find some sort of cover, and find a way out.

As I made my way away from the chaos and towards the opposite end of the station, I tried to help a few scared people towards the back, and up against the wall. Obviously some folks were freaked. I really wasn't sure if it was a ""guy with a gun on a rampage"" situation or not, but the way I saw the police responding, it was safe to assume so at the time. As the police's orders continued to get louder and louder without any gunfire, I assumed it was just another ""naked guy in BART"", or bum situation - so I left rear of the station to get a closer look.

The guy is completely surrounded at this point, and I could smell and taste the pepper spray in the air. Getting as close as I could, I realized that I was directly in the line of fire should an officier miss his shot, and a taser to the face did not sound like the icing I wanted for my Friday night cake.
I was really surprised to hear the shot.

It did not sound like a pistol sized taser (which typically uses charged co2 cartridges), so I assume it was the shotgun with a less lethal shell. From where I was, I was not able to get a clear view. Seconds later, the police dog-piled the suspect and he was (perhaps unconsciously) in custody. 

As I made my way up the stairs and out of the station I noticed two police officiers, one of which appeared to be wounded and suffering the effects of pepper spray. They did not look like they were in the mood to talk, but I did point him in the direction of the water fountain (not that I'd recommend using a BART water fountain in any other case than an extreme emergency).

Living in SF, we're all accustomed to seeing our fair share of shit in a day - but this one was pretty intense! I have not seen any other news sources picking this up, which compelled me to post this.

Anyone have a video? Also, I'd love to get the full story.

TL;DR: Got off the BART in the middle of police standoff. People were freaked. Dude fought law and lost hard. Pepper spray sucks.



**UPDATE**
**6/15 (approx 4:45pm) EVENT #2 !!!!!**

Ironically the entire intersection of Sutter and Grant was just evacuated right in front of me due to a bomb scare. Police cars and bomb sniffing dogs were absolutely swarming the scene within minutes! I was at work, and suddenly heard a huge explosion that rattled our windows. Co-workers thought it was a garbage truck, but I knew better. 

Apparently some kids threw a high powered firework (possibly an M-80, or larger) between a planter and the plate glass window of a Japanese restaurant (which has since completely shattered due to the explosion's shockwave). 

According to the SFPD officer I questioned, one, or possibly two youths had planted the explosive and ran - one of which (wearing all white) filming the reactions of the crowd afterwards. He then ran westbound on Sutter Street towards the tunnel, said a nearby security guard.

I personally saw one suspect being tackled by a group of fed up civilians preforming a citizens arrest (you guys rock) who may, or may not have been involved. It was rumored that this particular suspect tried to steal a leather jacket out of a nearby clothing store during the commotion.

Either way, it's been a pretty intense couple of days - and I think I'll be staying in tonight.

Also, in my opinion it takes a special kind of dumb ass to do something like this in a large metropolitan area given the recent circumstances. We've all inappropriately messed with fireworks before, but had I seen the guy (kid or no) who did this, an ass kicking would have definitely been in store for him. He's lucky he wasn't shot!

I'm sure a full story on this will be available shortly...

Was anyone else there?

TL;DR: Dumb ass kids set off a 1/4 stick of dynamite in a planter during a busy afternoon in Union Square, shattering a window and scaring the shit out of everyone. Police and bomb squad respond with gusto. Mass chaos for 20 minutes.

It officially starts at 5:00pm but feel free to show up anytime unless you are participating in the White Elephant Exchange (see details below). Zekes is technically a restaurant so it is all ages, but I wouldn't recommend bringing children there. That would be weird. I also don't recommend eating their food unless you're drunk. We'll bring cookies and sweets and there are several restaurants in the area too.
I feel like it's only appropriate to show up in the fanciest of clothes when attending a party at Diamond Bar, but wear whatever you want.
Last years Secret Santa was a cluster due to people not showing up so this year we are having a white elephant exchange. I'm going to suggest you spend right around $20 but feel free to be creative. This exchange will start at 8 so make sure to get there with enough time to turn in your gift and get a number. Your gift needs to be wrapped or in a gift bag.
We'll also have some simple games on hand: Cards Against Humanity, Apples to Apples, Fluxx, ect.
Zekes is an 18 minute walk from Montgomery BART and a 6 minute walk from Cal-train.

It's incredible to see. It will appear at 6:15 PM about 10 degrees above the horizon in the NW (use the compass on your phone). It will then pass almost straight overhead and vanish in the SE sky about 15 degrees above the horizon around 6:20. The journey takes about 5 minutes and it will be a yellowish object that's second in brightness only to The Moon.

It will be hard to miss. Skies are forecast to be clear.

Edit:[Here is an image showing its path in the sky](http://i.imgur.com/nVdVJ.png)

Edit 2: What a great night for this to happen. Clear and calm, no moon in the sky, and it came pretty close to Jupiter. I knocked on my neighbor's door to get him and his two kids out to see it. They got a telescope for xmas so I helped them set it up and see Jupiter and the Pleiades. Yay for astronomy.

Someone asked me to post it after I finished it, submitted for grading, and got a final grade in the class.  So here it is!

This paper mostly talks about how BART was created with the sole intention of funneling people into San Francisco to benefit the businesses located in the central downtown district.  There's plenty of misspellings and problems, but it was for a class and I did all the research+writing in 10 weeks.

Also I watermarked the paper, but realize people can just copy/paste the words.  I don't see why anyone would want to steal my paper...but if you do steal it, that's mean.

Seems relevant with the whole strike thing coming up.

For 2012 GrMD we're returning to Lindley Meadows for more food, fun and shiny things. We'll provide hamburgers and hotdogs but please contribute by bringing additional food and drink. If that's too much work you can also bring cash to help pay the cost of organizing. Last year the total cost ended up being around $5 a person. We'll also have a small, by donation  bar. 

We booked the same sites we had last year, tables 1-5 in Lindley Meadows. This starts at 2:00pm 

*If you're using BART: Get off at Powell and take the 5-Fulton to 30th Ave. Cross the street and walk to JFK. Cross JFK, the large group of nerds will be directly in front of you. 

*If you're driving: Enter 30th and JFK drive into your GPS. Look for the reddit Crest banner. 

To volunteer or help organize please email amylukima@gmail.com. Last year we didn't use two of our picnic sites, if you have an idea of how to use them we'd love to hear from you. 

P.S. If you want to hang out with other redditors more than once a year join the San Francisco Bay Area redditors meetup group. We do awesome stuff all the time.

http://fifivonboogers.imgur.com/all/

He is two years old, a lab/rottie/?? mix, and about the best behaved and smartest dog you'll ever meet. I adopted Banksy from a shelter in Denver two years ago and we have been living in the Bay Area for over a year. I have made every possible sacrifice to keep this amazing, amazing dog, but recent changes in my life have made me realize that Banksy needs a new home, more room and more attention than I am now able to give him. I am utterly heartbroken over this and looking for the best home possible so that I know this wonderful dog can be happy from now on.

Banksy (neutered) was adopted at 9 weeks old. By 12 weeks, he was fully housebroken. He does not chew on anything and never has. He is part Energizer Bunny and needs an owner that (a) has or has owned large dogs (Banksy = ~90 lbs), (b) understands dog behavior and training and (c) has a large yard. I have put a huge amount of effort into properly training Banksy and in him you will find a remarkably obedient and well-behaved dog who will sit down if you snap your fingers and come running when you whistle. He has TONS of energy - loads and loads of it - and he needs a place to run around and let it out. The ideal scenario would be if you also had a large, high-energy dog so they could run it out of each other.

Banksy is about the most lovable dog ever, as I think the photos demonstrate. Even people who claim to hate dogs fall in love with him. I do not have enough words to tell you how wonderful this dog is. Message me with any questions. Please pass this on to anybody who may be interested. I will keep looking until I find the right owner who can give his amazing dog the love and attention he deserves. Many thanks.


UPDATE: As of 1/27, Banksy has found a wonderful home where he is being fostered and where he may hopefully be adopted outright. I am so utterly grateful to everybody who reached out to help, give comments, provide encouragement, etc. What am amazing community this is.

**Crissy Field Monthly Meetup, Sept. 30th**
We are doing a potluck picnic at Crissy Field starting at 11am. This is the same place the first GrMD was held. It has amazing views of the bridge and bay. Make sure to dress in layers as it can get very windy there. Picnic tables and grills tend to be full early in the day so if you get there a little early and see a free table please grab it. I'll bring the reddit banner to help you find us. 


I'm going to make some more alcoholic punches and I'll bring a giant jug of water as well. If you can bring a little bit of cash to help cover ingredients and cups/paper plates/nametags/forks/spoons/napkins that would be awesome.   


If you use this address you should get directions to the picnic area.
1199 east beach
presidio San Francisco, CA 94129
(415) 561-7690
parksconservancy.org‎


**Here's some information I copied from the crissy field site.**

* Park in beachfront lots just west of the Marina gate.
* Bring sweatshirts and sunglasses for the kids, as the wind can blow sand.
* Although the water is usually clean and safe, heed warnings when they are posted.
* The Warming Hut is, appropriately enough, a place to escape the wind and fog that blow through the Golden Gate.
* The wind usually picks up by mid-day. If you want a quiet walk, go during the early morning hours.
* The beach can be seen at its widest during low tide.
* You can legally fish or crab without a license at Torpedo Wharf at the west end of Crissy Field. Look for posted regulations.

**What should you bring to a potluck?**

* hotdogs
* hamburgers
* buns
* chips
* desserts
* sides
* drinks
* cash(in case everyone brings chips and we need to do a Safeway run)
* drinks



**Halloween Party, October 27th**
[We are having a big party at Fort Mason center.
](http://www.facebook.com/events/488317277846859/declines/?notif_t=group_activity)
Like we've discussed in previous threads our group has grown a little too big for us to do major indoor parties at public venues. So for Halloween we are going to try to host our first event at a totally private venue-the Fleet Room at Fort Mason center. If you have an idea for an activity, decorations or anything else let me know, we have the room. I've contracted an outside bartender who will set up at the party for a minimum of $2400, which is a laughable number for us.


Unfortunately private venues cost money. The room fees, security, permits and insurance have come to a little over $1300. Going by normal attendance we normally have about 120 people show up to events so we're charging $13 with the extra funds going to candy snacks and decorations. Private Halloween parties typically cost $25 - $100 so this is still relatively cheap. Also, I pre-paid the fees before we found a house we liked and decided to make an offer. We'll have to come up a downpayment soon so if you know you are going I would appreciate it so much if you could buy your ticket ASAP.

https://www.wepay.com/events/reddit-trick-or-treat-meetup-day-2012

Here's the generic description for our Halloween Party on reddit:
Join in on our 2nd annual reddit Trick or Treat meetup day!
This year we've reserved the fleet room at Fort Mason Center for a totally private event to avoid the awkward ""Are you from the internet"" moments. There will be a dance area, a bar, and depending on our budget mounds of candy and sweets. This is open to all ages.
Prior to this party we'll also be hosting another small groups dinner session. You can sign up and be assigned to a small group of internet strangers to have dinner with at a nearby restaurant. That way you'll be able to get to know someone before you arrive. To sign up send an email to amylukima@gmail.com

We'll take photos of costumes and upload them to reddit gifts for the internet to vote on. The overall top 5 winners will receive gift certificates from reddit gifts.

It's passing again this evening with an Iridium Flare 27 minutes later.,64,13,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/15oyqr/did_you_miss_the_international_space_station_last/,"A lot of people missed out on last night's ISS fly by, so here is another heads up for tonight (Dec 30). We are forecast for clear skies again. Details about tonight's two events:


1.) International Space Station: Tonight at 5:25 PM, look directly NW. It will appear about 10° above the horizon. It won't pass directly overhead like it did last night, but more off to the NE. 5 minutes later it will disappear in the SE. It should pass very close to Jupiter and be brighter (magnitude -2.9). [Here is an info-pic](http://i.imgur.com/yUNyM.png).

Then get some hot tea or cold beer, look at the night sky for 27 more minutes............

2.) Iridium Flare. If you've never seen an [Iridium Flare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_flare), it's when a satellite's flat solar panels reflect a concentrated beam of light down to earth. Imagine using your wrist watch to reflect sunlight into someone's eyes. Same concept. Here is a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iftO1k41fC4) and here is [another](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PFUP5LPyuA). We will be able to see Iridium Satellite #62 tonight at 5:52. Look to the SSW 28° above the horizon. This will reach magnitude -6.2 (much much brighter than the ISS). [Here is an info-pic](http://i.imgur.com/tjcxx.png)

A few weeks ago a fellow redditor posted on here saying she needed to find a home for her big dog named Banksy. She said he was the perfect dog, well-behaved, all that good stuff. I already have two rescue dogs and am quite busy between my two jobs, but based on her description of him along with the size of my backyard, it seemed like something I could handle. I told her if no one else could take him, I could foster him and possibly adopt him if he got along well with my other dogs. Turns out no one else wanted the big guy, so she dropped him off at my place and never looked back.

It's been a few weeks and things have been... stressful. Long story short he does not get along with my one year old male dog, at all, and I'm honestly a bit concerned my dog is nearing a mental breakdown. Banksy is VERY alpha and needs everyone to know it. So with that, I'm now looking for a new home for Mr. Banksy.


I know that isn't the best way to sell someone on this dog, but I want to make sure the new owner knows what he's getting.

Now, Banksy isn't a BAD dog. He has good intentions, he's just not socialized. He's a big dog, about 90 lbs (although he could afford to lose 10-15 lbs at least), but he doesn't realize his size. He needs to be trained to be around other dogs and learn what is appropriate as far as level of aggression while playing. He's also not leashed trained very well, but in the few weeks we've had him, he has gotten better. When you're on the couch he LOVES to cuddle up next to you and really likes attention. He loves playing tug and also likes playing fetch with a semi-deflated soccer ball. He needs someone who is experienced in training big dogs. Also it would probably be best if he was the only dog in the house, at least until he's better socialized.

[Here's some photos of the strapping lad.](http://fifivonboogers.imgur.com/all/) (Photos taken by his former owner.

SO... who wants to give this pup a loving home?

*I've already contacted a few of the local rescues (ARF, Rocket Dog, Homes At Last). They've either rejected accepting him because he's not on death row, or have ignored my emails.

We had so much fun at the meetup last month that we are doing another one! The biggest complaint in the last thread was that we gave to late of notice (like omg 1 day wasn’t enough!?) Any way we are planning another meetup 2 weeks from now. Info below”

**WHEN:** Sunday, March 10th

**WHERE:** [Chabot Gun Club in Castro Valley](https://plus.google.com/112901592242016466001/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en)

So if you are a bay area gun owner and feel like putting some rounds down range with some fellow redditors please join us for a morning/afternoon of pleasant conversation and hot lead

If you are not a gun owner but are interested in guns and would like to learn about shooting and firearms in a stress free and safe environment we would love for you to join us. At the last meetup we had all sorts of guns big and small, shotguns, pistols, modern rifles, and vintage rifles, so you can learn as much as you want!

If you despise guns and think they are the spawn of Satan you are welcome to come too!  Everyone should know about firearm safety and how to operate a firearm correctly even if you are morally opposed to their existence. Even if we can’t convince you that guns are great I promise we will respect you and your opinion :)

**EDIT:** Please fill out this doodle (survey majigger) to let us know what day works best for every one! http://doodle.com/adx6cyns8perdqt7

**EDIT 2:** Everyone please post your RSVP in this thread here, we are trying to get the numbers nailed down

I'm sorry if this is coming off as a craigslist spam, but I'm desperate and figured the hivemind may offer a hand.  

A little bit more about me: I'm as likely to freak out over some new app/software/tech as a I am about so and so band coming to SF.

http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Text_of_California_Proposition_34_(November_2012)


**Summary:**

Repeals death penalty and replaces it with life imprisonment without possibility of parole. Applies retroactively to existing death sentences. Directs $100 million to law enforcement agencies for investigations of homicide and rape cases. Fiscal Impact: Ongoing state and county criminal justice savings of about $130 million annually within a few years, which could vary by tens of millions of dollars. One-time state costs of $100 million for local law enforcement grants.

[Discussion]",58,11,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/egncr/dear_rbayarea_we_are_all_brothers_and_sisters/,"I've been noticing a disappointing trend, which is expressing hatred, dislike, and disapproval of certain cities and peoples in our Bay Area.

We need not to do this. We have a beautiful opportunity here - to embrace each other and our larger community and the thrills and joys that can come from all areas in the Bay.

Discussions about whether or not Danville is 'legit' Bay Area. Dismissing San Jose news and opinion because it 'sucks'. Hating on Oakland because of it's reputation as dangerous. This all serves no one, it merely promotes imaginary borders between us.

There has been a sudden surge in the popularity of individual city subs in the BA and it is because of such malicious remarks.

I don't see the purpose of having to break our potential community apart due to such absurdity.

I looked at the oakland sub today and they have a post about the art murmur, which is really fun and cool. Why isn't stuff like that here? It should be here (too)! Redditors from all over the Bay should be able to receive such news and event updates. Why wouldn't someone from Richmond want to know about cool shit happening in Oakland, San Jose, or Palo Alto?

I don't know beyond making a post like this how I could better encourage positive use of the Bay Area reddit. If anyone has any suggestions I am open to them. Perhaps, my vision of this reddit is delusional and misguided, but I hope we can work together to reconcile our differences and turn this subreddit around.

So let's start an open a dialog about this.

Thank you and let's respect each other!",,False,self,t5_2qjyy,False,,,True,t3_egncr,http://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/egncr/dear_rbayarea_we_are_all_brothers_and_sisters/,moderator

You could say I'm a child of the 90s construction boom so I saw this wealth from the outside. I have partied in mansions and have leeched off the incredible wealth that is here. 
That being said, there is SO MUCH more to this place than entitled millionaires. I remember the George Lucas debacle and the reddit comments made me sad for eeryone that writes off the north bay.

Edit: The MILFs, you poor fools know nothing of the MILFs.

Consistently cheapest gas I've found in Marin: Gas &amp; Shop in San Anselmo. The people who reviewed it on Yelp appear to have mental deficiencies.

Edit: the story of the San Geronimo Valley (http://www.sgvcc.org/valley/history.html) is actually quite interesting and makes me proud of the residents of the valley, many of whom I know still.

Edit: tomorrow I'll try to add some general misconception busting stuff, any North Bayers want to contribute anything, please go ahead.

Edit: I'll add this here:

Keeping Marin preserved in its natural state vs. a train/affordable housing that would bring more human traffic/ larger pop. is a very complex issue for me and everyone I've talked to here about it. I want nothing more than for everyone to be able to experience living here, but then it wouldn't be ""here"" anymore. To be clear, I ONLY mean that a larger population would result in less natural beauty b/c of development, not that any group is unwelcome or wouldn't care about preserving nature, because that's clearly racist classist bullshit. 
I'd love to have a conversation about this, but I fear that like in the past in this subreddit, it would devolve into a conversation about using the poor in low-income housing as a weapon to teach the wealthy a lesson, as I thought it did in the George Lucas posts. Speaking as a low-income person, we have no inherent desire to treat our surrounding badly. It's also really important remember that some areas of Marin are zoned for only 1 house per .5 acre.

""ATT Free Msg: Your data use this month places you in the top 5% of users. Use Wi-Fi to help avoid reduced speeds. Visit www.att.com/dataplans or call 8663447584""

Someone called and a representative said the whole region has been placed on capped speeds since we use up a lot of bandwidth until the 15th of jan.

Edit: here is the email I received from AT&amp;T today:

High Data Usage Alert

Like other wireless companies, AT&amp;T is taking steps to manage exploding demand for mobile data. We're responding on many levels, including investing billions in our wireless network this year and working to acquire more network capacity. 

As mentioned on a previous bill, we're also taking additional, more immediate steps to help address network congestion and improve reliability. One of these steps involves a change for some customers who use extraordinarily large amounts of data in a single billing period - about 12 times more data than the average smartphone user. 

For the current billing cycle, your data usage indicates you could be affected by this change. Here's how it works: 

Smartphone customers with unlimited data plans may experience reduced speeds once their usage in a billing cycle reaches the level that puts them among the top 5 percent of heaviest data users. These customers can still use unlimited data and their speeds will be restored with the start of the next billing cycle. 

We're writing because you are in the top 5 percent of heaviest data users for this billing cycle. Because we recognize that data usage can change from month to month, you will not see reduced speeds this billing cycle. 

Beginning with your next billing cycle, we'll send you a text message if you are approaching the top 5 percent of heaviest data users. We'll also send you a second text message if you cross into the top 5 percent of heaviest users, at which point you may see reduced speeds for the rest of the month. 

Customers have several ways to manage extremely high data usage. 

Wi-Fi offers great speeds and doesn't add to your wireless data usage. Consider using Wi-Fi when possible for applications that use the highest amounts of data, such as streaming video apps, remote web camera apps, large data-file transfers (like video) and some online gaming. 

You may also consider switching to a tiered data plan if speed is more important to you than having an unlimited data plan. Customers on tiered plans can pay for more data if they need it, and will not see reduced speeds. 

To estimate how much data different activities use, and find out more about Wi-Fi or tiered data plans, visit https://www.att.com/dataplans or call Customer Care at 800-331-0500.",,False,self,t5_2qjyy,True,,,True,t3_npl3i,http://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/npl3i/att_capping_speeds_in_bay_area/,

http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Text_of_California_Proposition_37_(November_2012)


**Summary:**

Requires labeling of food sold to consumers made from plants or animals with genetic material changed in specified ways. Prohibits marketing such food, or other processed food, as “natural.” Provides exemptions. Fiscal Impact: Increased annual state costs from a few hundred thousand dollars to over $1 million to regulate the labeling of genetically engineered foods. Additional, but likely not significant, governmental costs to address violations under the measure.

1363887912.0,42,self.bayarea,1aqszh,Join the Reddit Camping trip Saturday 3/30 at the Pinnacles with fire! caves! pinnacles! and a campsite taco bar!,59,17,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/1aqszh/join_the_reddit_camping_trip_saturday_330_at_the/,"Come camp with the Reddit crew for a night! There are caves! and pinnacles! an ancient volcano! awesome hikes! dogs allowed! and Tacos!

**The plan:**

* Sign up on [CampingBud](http://campingbud.com/t/CQTID)  - this is what we're using to organize the trip

* Leave the Bay Area for the Pinnacles morning of 3/30. Return afternoon/evening of 3/31. Rideshares to be posted to our campingbud website (more on that in a minute).

We are allowed to start setting up camp at 1pm. If you want to get there earlier to hike or climb whatever, that's fine. Just park in the main lot and meet up at spots 131 and 132 later. We will camp over night, share ghost stories around a campfire, or maybe cards against humanity, or who knows, we always find ways to amuse ourselves. In the morning we have to clean up and clear out the campsite by 11am. You are welcomed to stay longer to hike and or climb more if you move your car to the main lot.

A fellow SF Redditor, Ke, was kind enough to make a website for organizing our Reddit camping trips. We use this site for signups and communication since it has a neato waitlist feature that makes organizing these things way easier.

**How to sign up**

1.	Go to [CampingBud](http://campingbud.com/t/CQTID)

2.	Click Join This Trip (up on the top right)

3.	Register with your name, and real email and phone. We use this as communication. It’s just me. I’m not going to drunk dial you at 3am. Ke isn’t going to sell your email address on the black market in India. It’s fine.

**Using the site**

4.	Sign up for Carpooling (Transportation link at top)– We have very limited parking so carpooling is a must. If you have a car, please sign up and state:

* how many free spots you have
* what city you will be leaving from
* what times you plan on leaving/coming back.
 
It’s ok if this is your first trip and are apprehensive of riding with someone you don’t know. We were all n00bs once too, so keep in mind we know how you feel.

5.	Sign up for tent space (Lodging link at top) – sign up for where you’re sleeping. We have a couple to borrow, but they get taken quickly. You can always rent one from REI.

6.	Sign up to bring stuff (Items link at top) - We always need some camp necessities, like firewood, water, and beer. Let us know what you are bringing to share so we don't all show up with 50 packs of hotdogs.

7.	Pay your share of the reservation fee ($8.50) online or, just give it to me in person. Whichever you choose. https://www.wepay.com/xqztowy/events/pinnacles-camping

**Be responsible for your own stuff – You’re going to want a **

* sleeping bag
* pad or air-mattress to sleep on
* pillow
* jacket and warm clothes (its get cold at night! Bring a hat!)
* Foods
* Boozes
* Beers
* Tissues, toothbrushes, etc.
* Money for your vehicle to pay the $5 entrance fee
* Flashlights…or fleshlights. Either or.

**Rules:**

Please keep your camping / ride status updated. If you can no longer make it, please update your status on the campingbud website so other can take your place. It also makes my organization much easier.

Please see park rules for other info: http://www.nps.gov/pinn/planyourvisit/cgrules.htm

We have two group campsites put together, so we can fit up to 40 people.



**Activities**

With a large amount of people, we can break off in sections to do different activities if we want. If you want to hike, lets go. If you want to climb, go climb. Want to go check out the caves (of course you do), lets go. If you want to sit and camp and drink, that’s a-ok too. Just remember, Pinnacle climbing is srs bzns for experienced climbers only. I don’t know a damn thing about climbing, so I can’t answer any of your climbing questions. 



**FAQ’s**

**Can I come if I don’t have any supplies?**

You do need to be responsible for yourself. You can always rent tents, sleeping bags, sleeping pads and more at REI or other sporting goods stores. Check the campingbud page for ride shares.



**Are there restrooms?**

Yes. With running water. There’s even a couple showers.



**Will there be campfires?**

Yes, permitted there isn’t a clean air warning or something that day



**Can I bring my child?** 

No. We’re a bunch of 20 and 30 somethings enjoying nature and drinking in the woods. We can be somewhat vulgar at times, and prefer it that way.



**Can I bring my dog?** 

Yes. But keep him/her off of the trails. Park rules. Also, make sure your dog isn’t going to bark all night long or we will shun you to the caves.



**OMG are there really caves?**

Yes, and they should be open. Read more about them on the website. http://www.nps.gov/pinn/



**What’s the reservation fee?**

The reservation fee is the fee I paid for us to rent the campsites for the night. It should come out to around $8 a person.



**What is the entrance fee?**

The park charges a $5 entrance fee per vehicle that is not included in the reservation fee. Please pay the nice ranger at the entrance 5 per car for the whole weekend. 



**Can I get on the Waitlist?**

Yes. The site should email you once someone cancels and there is room for you



**Blah Blah Blah Blah?**

I’ve never been to the Pinnacles before so I can’t answer a lot of questions. Please refer to the nps website for any questions, and also, pictures of neat things to look at while you are there.

1291956804.0,45,self.bayarea,ejczu,San Francisco reddit Christmas Party: December 11th,47,2,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/ejczu/san_francisco_reddit_christmas_party_december_11th/,"The San Francisco Bay Area reddit meetup group is hosting a Christmas meetup this Saturday, December 11th at 3pm at Rogue in
Northbeach.  http://www.rogue.com/


This is going to be our biggest meet of the year. We're expecting 100+ people. If you've been lurking in r/meetup or the (meetup group)[http://groups.google.com/group/SFredditors?pli=1] and have yet to come to a meetup, this is a great opportunity to come out and meet others. 



F.A.Q.s



**What happens at a meetup?**

We eat food, drink lots of alcohol, play games or just talk.




**How do I find you**

Normally there's someone wearing a reddit shirt, or you can just look for the group of nerds. You can also PM me and I'll send you the reddit google voice number, text me when you get there and I'll find you.





**I don't know anyone else, will I just end in the corner by myself?**

The whole point of a meetup is to meet people.  A lot of us have close friends we've met through meetups and we continue to come out because we want to meet more people. reddit is full of diverse people and our meetups have always reflected that, whether you're new to the city or you just want to expand your group of friends this is a good place for you to be. 




**Do I need to bring anything**

We reserved a venue so there's no cover but if you plan on eating or drinking you need to bring money. We all pay individually. 



If you have any questions or you're apprehensive about meeting people from the internet feel free to PM me.
