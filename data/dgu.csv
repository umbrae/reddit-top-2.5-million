What you're doing is a great thing and really this subreddit should have more love than it does.  The right our founders spoke about is each and every one of ours. Regardless if we want to use them or not, it is our right!  It's sad to think there are those that think Government should act as authoritarians and remove that right from law abiding American citizens.

The ironic thing to me is that our country is currently engaged around the world against democratically elected regimes and actively arming their opposition, wither by arms or funneling millions or billions through shady tunnels.  The United States is the largest seller of small arms in the world! Sometimes we don't even sell others weapons as with the case of 'Fast and Furious' (Google that one for an eye opener!) but instead give them to mafia elements in Mexico for them to only turn up after killing our police or border officers here in America.

For any government official to stand up, much less in front of freaking children and use such shitty and blantant propaganda to try and disarm, restrict or place requirements on their very own citizens while secretly arming the world in any other terms is called, **TREASONOUS!**

These soulless knuckleheads disgust me to the core with their behavior!  This obviously is going to be coming to end soon.  If I can notice it so too will others.  It is downright disgusting to gerrymander to bullshit such as this!

But it's people like **you** who post here knowing that there is more good that comes from the right to protect yourself than any tyrannical government official could tell you otherwise.  

Freedom: You're doing it right!

HATS OFF TO YOU!

Just wanted to give you a quick update:
 
Last night Side Pockets had a 'robbery' as two men entered demanded money then fled on foot. Even with Officers on the scene they fled and escaped capture. (See Herald Mail Article Link &gt;&gt;&gt;) Police Seek Two in Robbery
 
I want you to know the rest of the story:
 
A little before 11pm while cleaning our Laundry across the street at 812 South Potomac Street in Hagerstown, MD we noticed a young man walking in front of our windows and looking in at us. (Our doors auto lock at 11pm) I didn't think anything of it until we exited the building and I saw him and another young man in the shadows at the rear of my Tahoe setting on a wall.
 
In that quick second glance I saw the one now added a white piece of cloth around his neck that was covering from his nose to his hoodie. That really struck me as odd, so I watched them as I walked around the Tahoe with my handicapped wife.
 
As I went to put her in the passenger side door I realized with only one door lock I had to 'Unlock ALL Doors' to let her in. With them setting less than 15 foot from the drivers door I realized that this could be a robbery or car jacking going to happen. 
 
Before unlocking the doors I unsnapped the holster on my 45ACP Kimber Ultra Compact Semi-Auto handgun and pulled my coat back. I realized if they went for the drivers side doors I would only have a second or two to pull my wife out to safety and draw my weapon. Lucky for me they did not move.
 
Next I would need to get within 10 feet from them to enter the Tahoe and lock the doors. I placed my hand on the Kimber and slowly walked around the Tahoe from the front. As I looked at them they were looking at me, faces still partly covered, from the shadows. I was really worried for our safety as I needed to approach and enter the drivers door. I kept my hand on the un-drawn Kimber as I walked up and entered the door. When they saw the handgun they shrunk back a little and allowed me to enter and leave the parking area. 
 
When I was at a safe distance I then called the Hagerstown Police Dispatch and asked them to keep an eye on the Laundry and reported the two young men and their actions. I was informed by the Dispatch Desk that there was now Officers on the scene for a Side Pockets Tavern Robbery across the street. I then went back and checked the surveillance tape. The one suspect matched the closest man to me in the light colored hoodie and hat that had walked past my Laundry at Closing time watching us.
 
Please add this to my letter opposing additional Firearms Regulations when you go to the upcoming meetings. Please let everyone know that you don't need to use a handgun or firearm to stop crime. Sometimes just being prepared will make a criminal choose a different path to take.
 
Also please thank the Maryland State Police and Past Legislators that passed the laws for allowing me to be one of the few Maryland Citizens that is allowed to carry a Registered Concealed Carry Handgun for Personal Protection. I hope someday 'ALL Legal Maryland Citizens' could apply for Handgun Permits and that new Handgun Permits will be reciprocal with other states.
 
I believe that having my Kimber ready and on my side last night kept me and my Wife from being Victims of Violent Crime once again.....
 
Sincerely,
 
Doy C. Sneckenberger

Hagerstown, MD 21740 USA (Washington County)

This was very suspicious. I got in the house safely and locked up behind myself. But once inside, poor Maverick was looking at me like ""mom take me out, I gotta go!"" But I have no idea if someone is on my property, its dark and I'm alone. Then I had a thought. I grabbed our firearm. I wasn't harmed, and I didn't see anyone while I was outside and I never did find out what happened to that car which was gone the next day, but I was prepared.

I'm finding plenty of ""feel good"" DGU stories where the gun owner protected his life and his property either by shooting and wounding or killing the bad guy, or simply using the gun as a deterrent. However there are two sides to every story and while I know some people don't want to talk about the situations where something doesn't work out just right, they are just as much a part of the conversation, and sites like gunssavelives.net don't show those stories because its opposite of their point, and I understand that. 

So I'm looking for stories where someone attempted to use their gun to defend themselves or others, however did NOT succeed in their attempt and ended up wounded or dead themselves. This would be any story where a bad guy had their own gun and shot the good guy who was trying to protect himself, or a story where the bad guy gets the gun away from the good guy and shoots them with it. Or even when a bad guy has a knife but the encounter happens at close enough range that the gun was an inefficient defensive measure. 

**TL;DR: Trying to find news stories of DGU events that did not end well for the gun owner. Any suggestions?**

Thanks to anyone who helps out with this, I've just hit a wall in my research and thought you guys might be able to point me in the right direction. ",,False,self,t5_2uo6h,False,,,True,t3_1976t5,http://www.reddit.com/r/dgu/comments/1976t5/need_some_help_with_some_research_on_defensive/,

It seems there are a few readers who don't agree with the concept of defensive gun use. Every post I make is immediately downvoted, which is stupid, considering that this isn't really a standard-fare subreddit. As mentioned previously, this subreddit is here to catalog incidents of DGU. Downvotes should be saved for submissions that aren't appropriate for the subreddit. But some will always abuse the system, so they spoil it for others. Until the DGU hate dies down, if you think a post isn't appropriate, instead of downvoting, please post your thoughts in the comments thread. And if our phantom downvoter is reading this, why don't you man up and post some text, so we can discuss this like adults.

* I need some help, here. Not moderating, but with submissions. I try to search the internet every day or so for DGU-related articles from news websites, but I don't catch everything. If you come across an instance of defensive gun use, whether on another forum, or maybe in your local news, please post it here (credit with x-post if from another subreddit).

When looking for dgu news stories, I'm shocked by the number of unchallenged home invasions I come across, many with violence and sexual assault.

The DGUs only tell one side of the story. Like /r/dgu, /r/homeinvasion is meant to catalog the number of home invasion incidents occurring throughout the country by mining news websites for current articles.

I invite everyone to subscribe and help by posting any home invasion stories you come across. 

Sure, we can point to the DGUs and say, ""Look at all the lives saved.""

We should also be able to point to the rise of home invasions and say, ""Look at all we might have saved."" We need this data.",,False,self,t5_2uo6h,False,,,True,t3_1etkpw,http://www.reddit.com/r/dgu/comments/1etkpw/announce_documenting_home_invasions_rhomeinvasion/,moderator

Also, keep in mind that if you find a post for submission, make sure to scan the article for a more original/local source. 

For example, [this post](http://easybakegunclub.com/news/2659/Clerk-uses-fire-extinguisher%2C-stops-robber-until-g.html#.UPnLCBNgygU.reddit) isn't the original, local source but [this link](http://articles.philly.com/2013-01-18/news/36396503_1_camden-man-eric-wren-camden-police-officer) from the top of the gun club blog's repost is an original source, more of what we're looking for.

Oh, one other thing regarding the above article. Please only post articles where the gun use was by a civilian or off-duty LEO or guard, instead of on-duty or in-the-line-of-duty incidents.
