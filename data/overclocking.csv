1340598455.0,73,self.overclocking,vk25i,Simplified Guide to Ivy Bridge Overclocking,91,18,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/vk25i/simplified_guide_to_ivy_bridge_overclocking/,"I'll preface this by saying this won't be the most in depth guide on Ivy Bridge overclocking, but my goal is to make a simple, easy to follow guide, for reaching the maximum possible safe frequency on your CPU.

To start, you're going to need some software, so go ahead and download it now.

* [Prime95](http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft/) - The bread and butter of CPU stability testing. Nothing beats Prime95 for verifying stability.

* [Intel Burn Test](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Benchmarks/IntelBurnTest.shtml) - Used to generate maximum possible heat in a short period of time; will generally get a CPU core 5C+ hotter than Prime95.

* [RealTemp](http://www.techpowerup.com/realtemp/) - Used to monitor your CPU temperature.

* [CPU-Z](http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html) - Used to monitor VCore.

Alright, now that you have the software you need, we can begin to actually overclock your CPU. Restart your computer and load up the BIOS. You're going to want to edit a few settings here. 

* Start by turning on Load Line Calibration (LLC). I recommend a setting of 50% LLC. 

The purpose of LLC is to combat ""vdroop"" which is the phenomenon that occurs when your CPU goes under load, the VCore will drop a lot, and if it drops too much, your CPU will become unstable. LLC combats this by delivering additional voltage once it detects your CPU voltage starting to droop. The reason we want to set it to 50% and not 100% is because setting it too high can be a bit dangerous, because LLC is not instantaneous. As the CPU goes under load, voltage droops, and LLC delivers additional voltage to compensate, but what happens when your CPU goes from being at 100% load to 0%? LLC can't react instantly, so you get a brief moment of significant overvoltage, too much of which could damage your CPU.

* Turn on ""offset"" overclocking.

Offset overclocking is much more desirable than static voltage settings and really shines when paired with LLC. Offset overclocking allows you to specify how much additional voltage the motherboard should deliver to the CPU once the CPU goes under load. To start with, just set this to 0.000v, but we'll bump it up as we progress. The advantage to offset overclocking versus static voltages is that you can keep the voltage range your CPU receives in very tight bounds. If you set your static voltage to say 1.300v and then go under load, you will drop down to 1.250v or so, but if instead you utilize an offset, you can keep voltage right around 1.300v.

* Disable all C-States.

~~If you get a high enough multiplier and offset, the hybrid sleep states on your CPU could actually cause a particularly weird problem. You could end up with a system that is 100% Prime95 stable (stable under heavily threaded loads) and not stable in games at all (lightly threaded loads). The reason for this is that if only two of your four cores are being loaded, the offset voltage delivered will be a lot lower than if all four cores were loaded, so the two cores will receive insufficient voltage and won't be stable. By disabling all C-states you prevent the CPU from entering hybrid sleep states, which will keep the voltages and multipliers locked. Note, this will increase power consumption a bit, but it will not disable the thermal safety protections built into your CPU, so don't worry.~~ Originally I recommended to disable all C-States (thus locking your multiplier and voltages), but really I suppose it'd be smarter to only do this if you actually run into problems. If your system seems 100% stable in a fully threaded Prime95, but you crash very quickly when playing a game or doing other lightly-threaded work, the problem might be related to C-States. A lightly threaded load won't peg all the cores so the offset voltages delivered won't be high enough to actually keep a single fully-loaded core stable. If you have these symptoms, you should disable all the C-States to force your CPU to run at full voltage and max multiplier 24/7.

**Alright, we've got our settings good to go, what now?**

Time to start overclocking! Start by setting your multiplier to 40 (that should be a nice safe starting point) and leave your voltage offset at 0.000v. Boot into Windows and fire up RealTemp, Prime95, CPU-z, and the Windows Event Viewer.

* **Finding your max multiplier**

Set Prime95 to run with the [following settings](http://i.imgur.com/zTdbZ.png) (use 8 threads if you have an i7 instead of an i5) and fire it up. Monitor your temps in RealTemp and make sure they stay below 85C while periodically refreshing the Windows Event Viewer looking for [WHEA Error 19](http://i.imgur.com/zmavm.png) and watching for errors in Prime95. WHEA Error 19 is triggered whenever the CPU makes a calculation error (but is able to catch it and fix it). A single WHEA error 19 means you are not stable, as it's just a crash that you got lucky was detected before it happened (two ""WHEA Error 19's"" in a row would basically be a crash, since it would be a miscalculation, followed by another miscalculation that verified that the incorrect bit was actually correct).

After 5-10 minutes if your temps are okay (below 85C), your voltages are okay (below 1.300v or 1.350v if you're particularly brave), and you don't have any errors in Prime95 or the Event Viewer, restart, bump your multiplier up by 1 and repeat. Continue to do this until one of the following things happens:

* Your system becomes too hot (more than 85C under load). If this happens, roll your multiplier back by 1 and skip to the last section of this guide.

* Your voltages become too high (above 1.300v [conservative] 1.350v [riskier]). If this happens, roll back your multiplier by 1, reduce voltages accordingly, and skip to the last section of this guide.

* Your system becomes unstable (this will happen often while we are determining the max speed your CPU is capable of). BSoD, Prime95 errors, random program crashes, and WHEA Error 19 all indicate a system that isn't stable. Your options to fix this are either to deliver more voltage, cool the CPU more, or lower the frequency. Seeing as how you've already bought your cooler, and we're trying to increase the frequency, that means it's time to start increasing voltages. Restart, bump your offset by .005v and repeat the process. If you can get stable within good bounds, continue to push till you can't. Eventually you'll reach a point where you can't get stable at a given frequency within safe bounds, which means it's time to drop the multi (and voltage settings) back 1 notch and get ready to wrap everything up!

**Finalizing everything**

If you've gotten to here, you're pretty much done, but since we're going to be using these settings for months and years, we're going to want to take the time to be extra-sure we've got everything in tip-top shape. The good news is, we don't have to learn anything new here, we're just going to make extra-sure that we're stable.

Fire up your usual overclocking software suite, but this time fire up Intel Burn Test. Run 5 runs of 10 and watch for WHEA errors and errors from within the program. If you get any errors, you need to deliver more voltages, but make sure your temps don't get too high. If they do, unfortunately you're going to have to roll back the multi by another tick and try again. Note, IBT will get your CPU hotter than Prime by a good bit, so I'm somewhat okay with allowing temps up to ~87C or so here, maybe even close to 90C since it's unlikely anything else you do will get the CPU this hot. It's still a great test though, since it's a hedge against hotter room temps, dust gunking up your CPU fans, etc.

If you successfully pass 5 runs of 10 IBT iterations, excellent! We've only got one test left! All we're going to do now is fire up Prime95 using the same settings we've been using the whole time, but this time instead of letting it go for 5-10 minutes, we're going to let it go for 8 hours+. Again, if you see errors in Prime or WHEA errors, time to deliver more voltages (again, temps must remain good, otherwise the multi needs to be lowered by an additional notch).

If you pass all your IBT runs and Prime95 runs, congratulations, your overclock is stable!!!

**Final Notes**

Q: *Is prime95 testing really necessary? My buddy says his system is ""game stable,"" but not ""prime stable"".*

A: I vehemently disagree with your buddy, and I think it shows a fundamental misunderstanding of stability. There is truly no such thing as being ""stable in games but not in prime95"". What, ""I'm stable in games but not Prime"" really means is, ""I only rarely experience game crashes, and I don't care that much about my data.""

A single WHEA error 19 or Prime95 error is just a crash waiting to happen. Sure, your game might not crash all the time, but it will crash eventually. Moreover, why in the world would you risk an unstable system for an extra 100 Mhz? The difference between 4400 Mhz and 4500 Mhz is less than 3%, and the actual in game performance increase from that jump will be even less than that. Unless you're trying to set records or show off your e-peen, there's simply no reason to risk any amount of instability for such a marginal increase in performance. Sorry to get so preachy, I mean, it's your hardware, in the end you should absolutely do what you want with it, but just know that there really is no such thing as ""stable in games, but not Prime"", unless you have great luck!

I hope you found this guide helpful, feel free to offer up any suggestions you have to improve it and I will edit it as necessary. Good luck and happy overclocking!

**6/25/12 edit:** Changed my recommendation on C-states. There's no reason to waste additional power and run slightly hotter if you don't need to, though it is worth mentioning that there is some lag associated with leaving the C1-E state and clocking back up (you'll get 3% or so worse performance in IBT if you leave your C1-E state enabled).",,False,self,t5_2rfc8,1340652143.0,,intel,True,t3_vk25i,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/vk25i/simplified_guide_to_ivy_bridge_overclocking/,

This is applicable for any CPU, but I was using this specifically on my i5-3570k.

Basically, you need to watch your Event Viewer for [WHEA errors](http://i.imgur.com/zmavm.png). These errors will pop up any time the CPU makes an error (even if it's able to detect and correct that error). So what you want to do is, boot up, load event viewer, and be on the look out for WHEA 19 errors. A single one of these turning up means your CPU is not stable.

So what I will do is, boot up, open event viewer, fire up prime 95, click maximum heat torture test but then switch to custom and change the time each FFT setting runs at from 15 minutes to 1 minute (your goal here is to just cycle through all the different FFT sizes relatively quickly), and then start the torture test. If you aren't stable, you're going to quickly see WHEA errors, even well before Prime95 ever reports an error (because it's entirely possible that your CPU makes an error that it then corrects which prime will never see).

I'll typically let that run for an hour or so, and I'll also do a quick run through of IntelBurnTest (since that will produce higher temps than Prime). If you can manage an hour of quick cycling FFT's in the newest version of Prime95 as well as 10 runs of IBT without seeing a single WHEA error, you are almost certainly stable.

You might think that these WHEA errors aren't worth caring about,, but you're absolutely wrong. Even if you aren't crashing often, these WHEA errors greatly decrease your actual performance (At 4.4 Ghz when I thought I was 'stable' but still getting WHEA errors, IBT would report my GFLops around 108-109, but once I gave the CPU enough volts that I removed all WHEA errors, I was consistently at 111-112 GFlops in IBT--this is because each time your processor has a parity error it needs to rerun its calculations). Moreover, a single WHEA error is just a crash or actual error that you just got lucky on.

Think of it like this, your CPU goes to add 2+2 and gets 5, and when it goes to check its work it gets a different answer (WHEA error), but it doesn't know which answer is correct, so it reruns the calculation. But if your system isn't stable (getting WHEA errors) then all it takes is 2 incorrect calculations in a row for things to go terribly wrong (2+2 = 5,  and the parity agrees!).

**TL;DR:** Fast cycling FFT sizes in the newest prime95 (1-2 minute runs) while watching for WHEA errors in your event viewer is going to be more accurate than a 12 hour+ prime95 run, as well as significantly faster when you're trying to determine if you're actually stable.",,False,self,t5_2rfc8,1337868186.0,,intel,True,t3_u2bwq,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/u2bwq/an_awesome_way_to_save_time_on_testing_stability/,

Currently got it OC'd to 4.4ghz at 1.15v.

Max'd at 70c on full load running IBT on Very high for 13mins.

De-lidded the chip, lapped the IHS. Reseated it using Liquid Pro on the cpu die. Used MX-4 between the cpu and cooler. Tops out at 60c.

Very easy mod to do too. Read a few guides, watched some of the Youtube vids, and went for it. Cut the sealer slowly and there's very little chance of killing the chip, unless you're a ham-fisted idiot.

The stock TIM under the heat shield is awful. It was completely dried out. Felt like bathroom caulking when I touched it. 
As soon as you reseat the IHS when the sealer is cleaned off, you can feel it actually touch the die properly.

Glad I had a go at this. Although that first power up when you put it all back together is an ass-clencher. Happy with the 10c drop. Also noticed that the IBT results were 2-3 secs quicker too afterwards.

I had an FX-8120 that I had been running at 4200 MHz @ ~1.3V, and I couldn't get it stable, so I returned it to factory settings. And I was getting random shutdowns from heat at factory defaults....

On to the fix. My processor was definitely getting hot; it was topping out at 70C, and during minecraft, of all things. So, I removed my Zalman CPU cooler, cleaned it, re-applied the AS5 paste, and reseated it. I had my PC on the floor on its side, side cover off, facing me so I could make sure all the fans were working, whatever.

I powered it on, and held my flashlight down at it as I watched it all come alive.....and that's when I happened to shine my flashlight down towards the bottom of my case, and I noticed something strange. My fan on my HD 6870 wasn't spinning at all. Well that's weird, but maybe it doesn't come on right after power on and waits until it detects a little heat to kick on.

So I waited about 30 seconds or so; I had gone into the BIOS to check my CPU temps before I booted. What the hell....so I reached down and gave it a little kickstart, and it started spinning.....at about 200 rpm, then stopped. Then kicked back on, then stopped....rinse and repeat.

Fast forward to about an hour later, and my video card is totally ripped apart, the heatsink is removed, and I'm sitting there screwing a 60mm case fan onto the base of my heatsink.

As you can guess, that didn't work too well.

So, fast forward another two days, and I'm installing my brand new Evga GTX 660 Superclocked. :-) My CPU temps seem to be much better after the re-grease too, I'm sitting here right now typing this out and I've got HWmonitor, Precision X, and Minecraft running in the background, and have been for a few hours now, and I'm seeing 50C (non-package), with a peak of about 52. I idle at about 27-29 too.

Do these temps seem accurate for my FX8120 with the Zalman cooler? Stock clocks too. Only one thing remains a mystery, both HWmonitor and similar things like CPUZ report my CPU Vcore as around 1.4V at all times, whereas I've got it manually locked at 1.275, the factory voltage, in my BIOS.

So I replaced the TIM under the IHS with Coollaboratory Liquid PRO followed with Tuniq TX-4 between the CPU and heatsink. The change was astounding. Just mind blowing. Before this I was using Arctic Silver 5 with the stock IHS TIM. Only two changes were the two TIMs. On the removal of the IHS, it took about 4 minutes with a new razor blade. Super easy.

I have already hit 5GHz sub 70 degrees. But it's not fine tuned enough to show off. Give me a day or so to lower the volts while maintaining stability and test.
 
 
**Setup:**

* Cooler: Corsair H100 with two Scythe AP-15 (push)
* CPU: Ivy Bridge 3770k
* CPU TIM: Tuniq TX-4
* CPU IHS TIM: Coollaboratory Liquid PRO
* Lapping: Both H100 and CPU IHS have been lapped to mirror copper.
 
 
**Results:**

4.8GHz @ ~1.322v (fluctuates from 1.34 at idle to 1.32 on load)

Temp at full load = ~60 - 62 degrees

Hyperthreading and Overclocking.,21,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/1dy8s6/something_i_think_more_people_should_be_aware_of/,"I've been overclocking for several years now, and while I wouldn't categorize myself as a top level tech expert or anything of the sort, I do know my way around a computer. Even after reading all of the OC guides and many articles on heat, voltage, performance, etc. I didn't come across this little gem until this past week. I thought I'd lay this out for other overclockers who may have missed the boat on this:

Unless you are doing rendering, folding, or encoding/decoding video or audio stuff, you really should disable Hyper-threading. Not many modern applications make good use of HT technology, aside from programs like what I said just above, and even then it seems to be hit or miss. I do a lot of After Effects work, and having 12 threads does help when I'm rendering. However, when I am gaming or doing any other work (Photoshop for example), the HT doesn't give me any kind of a performance boost. What it does do is increase my CPU temps by 16C and put extra stress on my OC. 

I'm on a 3930K and I got a bit of a bum processor. It took me 1.4v just to get stable at 4.5GHz, and even then I was pushing 87C in Prime95. When I disabled HT and redid my OC, I got to 4.5GHz on only 1.34v and my top temp in Prime95 is now 71C.

Take it or leave it, but my advice to you guys out there who are having issues keeping temps and voltages down without sacrificing processing power: ***Disable Hyper Threading if all you are doing is playing videogames!***",,False,self,t5_2rfc8,False,,intel,True,t3_1dy8s6,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/1dy8s6/something_i_think_more_people_should_be_aware_of/,

1364076322.0,12,self.overclocking,1avqqp,Why do CPU companies not push their chips to the fullest potential? ,14,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/1avqqp/why_do_cpu_companies_not_push_their_chips_to_the/,"This may be a seriously easy to answer question. But as I'm about to start overclocking for the first time, the question crossed my mind, and while I had a few theories, I had to admit to myself I didn't know the answer.

So why do CPU companies such as Intel or AMD not push their chips to the fullest potential? For example, the chip I use is capable of 4.0Ghz OCed, yet its stock is much lower at around 3.0Ghz. So why is this? 

The first thing that came to mind was power vs longevity. but from what I've seen a responsible overclock will not shorten the lifespan of a chip by a noticeable amount. So if not longevity, is it simply economics? Is it to their advantage not to make CPU's as fast as they can be? Or is it a question of reasonable cooling devices? Are they trying to find speeds that even a weak cooling system could handle? 

Like I said, probably a really simple answer, but I feel like its an answer I should know going into this.

1355378722.0,10,self.overclocking,14rtmj,560 Ti OC over 1GHz on air. Trying to overcome OCP protection and Nvidia driver limits. Looking for expertise...,14,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/14rtmj/560_ti_oc_over_1ghz_on_air_trying_to_overcome_ocp/,"I have an MSI N560 Ti Hawk that I think just may be a so-called golden chip. It OC's to 1GHz @ stock voltage without exceeding 62c max. With Nvidia 3xx series drivers it will not exceed 1GHz no matter what I try. Nvidiainspector and locked P states does nothing. It will say it's OC'ed to my desired frequency above 1GHz, but it does not take. 

If I install driver version 296.10, or older, I can break the 1GHz barrier. Initially, I tried 1014MHz, and it OC'ed perfectly, but... Within 30 seconds of testing in Skyrim the game would freeze and down-clock back to the factory overclock of 950MHz. I tried this several times, and it always reverted back to the stock OC after hitting 60c degrees.

This led me to believe it was related to overcurrent (OCP) protection. The more heat produced by the chip, the more current needed to maintain desired clocks. I came to this conclusion only after testing various levels of increased voltage to no avail. I began to wonder if I was hitting my TDP (thermal design power). TDP is a theoretical limit set by the factory designed to protect the card from too much current = heat.

Luckily, the MSI Hawk has an OCP disable switch as seen in the photos below. In overclocking, there is no reward without risk, so, I disabled it. Now, I can OC past 1000MHz. So far, I've been successful with 1025MHz @ 1.025v. It does not exceed 64c, and it does not scale back. Anything beyond that and it only runs for 30 or so seconds and scales back. I've tried as high as 1.087v, and it still scales back. It almost seems as though there is a secondary, perhaps driver based TDP limit. It's really odd, and really annoying. 

What's even worse is the 296.10 drivers. They absolutely suck in comparison to the 3xx series which make Skyrim look, and even run, much better, but their limitations totally suck. I've looked into bios editing, but from what I've read, the 3xx drivers are able to override any core clock bios changes. I'm now considering trying to find the values from the drivers running in the memory with a hex editor, and freezing them in place, but it's been years since I used a hex editor, and I've only ever hacked games with them. Another possible option would be to find the values in Nvidiainspector and freeze them.

Anyone have any ideas?

Do they go back and forth increasing multiplier and core clock or do they first raise the multiplier to some desirable amount then focus on the core clock?

This morning I've begun the process of overclocking following the guides I can find by adjusting BIOS settings and stepping up the multiplier followed by Prime95 to test temps/stability. I reached 3.8 and all seemed well -- too well.

Using HWMonitor and SpeedFan, I saw temps of about 28 idle/39 load from both, under CPUTIN and CPU for each respective program. I then realized that HWMonitor had a separate section for the cores of the processor, and that was reporting much, much higher temps, around 60 or higher. Using RealTemp, temps held at mid to high 60s under Prime95 while SpeedFan showed 39. This is under my current OC of 3.8.

My questions are twofold: what programs and temperature reading should I be paying attention to, and why could my temps be so high so quickly (or are they not, and I'm just too cautious?)

It seems that 900/1300 is a good stable point for me. With the errors occurring at a core clock as close as 915, it may be best to not try for 901-914 at this point. I do wonder, though, even with all cards being uniquely different in terms of overclocking potential: How is it that I am so far what most can do without any voltage tweaking (e.g. 1050/1550)? I can only really go 20 MHz past my card's stock core clocks, which seems ridiculously low. Further, though, it also seems weird that even though I can barely push my clock speeds (core/memory) any great length past stock, I obtain scores far higher than shown in guides regarding this card when they would overclock it to 1000+ MHz core/1500+ memory and with voltage increases as well.

I can and will provide any and all proof that I can, including past purchases, emails, and gift certificates proof to those who are interested.

Also, as further incentive, I am willing to take a minimum credit of $150 for the $169.92 I have to offer. If you want to give me full credit, that's awesome, otherwise I am okay with at least $150. Also, I can also complete a survey for you to get a 10% Discount code from FrozenCPU as I have made multiple purchases from them. Otherwise you can just use the code 'xtreme' for 5.1% off your purchase.

Usually windows explorer just crashes.

It's been a while since I've OCed, last rig was an AMD Phenom II and 790fx, so I'd still consider myself a bit of a nub.

4.4ghz was stable at 1.240 at 10 minutes of running prime95, running it for the 12 hour prime test now. Also, as a side note, I'm hitting 80 degrees C at 1.240 vcore, is this normal for the H80i, or do you think I need to de-lid?

I was really hoping to avoiding de-lidding this thing...

Now I guess I could keep pumping up the vcore, but considering 4.4ghz is fine at 1.240 I don't see how I would have to jump to over 1.300 for 4.5 ghz. Am I wrong?

I am using an H100 for cooling, I would like to keep it on the 'quiet' mode(1 on a scale of 1-3 on the CPU cooler selector). The system has 16GB of DDR3 2133mhz ram and I'm using the XMP default settings for timings and the 1.65volts on the ram. I have a bit of experience overclocking but am no expert, I have tweaked systems from back in the Pentium days to now but just a little bump here and there. When I bought the 3930k I knew it was finally time to get some real good OC going on and get my moneys worth.

It successfully posts with 1.410vid @48 but is unstable. I have been very interested in offset clocking lately so I will go over my settings real quick. I currently am running the cores at 48,48,46,46,44,44 (1-6 core depending on the ratio) ie 2 cores only gives me 48 multiplier, if I'm using all 6 cores then it throttles down to 44. I do this mostly because 2 of my cores seem to run much hotter than the other 4. I am using these settings with a .150 offset with the CPU Load Line Calibration set to high. CPU current capability set to 130%, VCCSA Load line at High with the VCCSA current capability set to 110%, Tprobe is enabled with phase control set to 'optimized'. I can get the Intel burn test to run successfully on all 6 cores at 4.4 ghz and all other factors but it does tend to throttle itself pretty often, usually when my two hotter cores start bumping at 85 degrees. Then my lovely 4.8 gets knocked down to 4.4 or lower. Any suggestions on my setup? Is the suggestion just to knock my core multipliers down or turn my h100 up to super(oh my god I can't hear) high? If I have to I will but I was wondering if there were any other little tweaks I could do that might even out my cores or just give me better performance, preferably with lower voltages.

Thanks, sorry if I rambled. Will provide some screenshots if requested.

So far I'm pretty sure I'm getting the FX-6300 CPU, on an ASUS M5A97 R2.0 (or a GA-970A-UD3, still not certain) motherboard, paired with a 7870XT GPU with 8GB of memory.

I read about people OC'ing their 6300's to around 4.5GHz with a Cooler Master Hyper Evo 212, which I'm also interested in getting. However, I have some questions -

1. Is this OC recommended with this motherboard?

2. I read about multipliers and whatnot, but the thing that confuses me the most are **voltages**. I got scared when I got to the part where it warns you to calculate the voltage or else it will destroy the CPU instantly. I though it was all automatic? Do I really need to worry about that with such a small OC? (Assuming 1GHz is small)

3. How loud is the cooler going to be compared to the stock one? I read that it's not so loud, but I thought I should ask.

And one last question - can anyone direct me to a guide that is less outdated (unlike the ones on the sidebar from 2009), where I can research more?

So I got really bored while Im waiting for insurance to get sorted, so I de-lidded the 3770K I had lying around. I dont even know if it still works, but I managed to get a friend who would let me try it in his PC when i go to work on it later in the week.

I have done a little reading on this and seen some vids. My question isnt really about the de-lidding because Ive already done that and taken off all the glue and shitty paste.

I was wondering if I could use some thermal padding around the IHS for extra heat dissipation?

I have some sheets sitting in a box, one of which is pretty thin and may work. 

Will this help or hinder? 

I dont know for sure but it may be thin enough to not lift the IHS off the die.

So yesterday, after spending two days cleaning it all out and re-doing the cable management, I began raising the voltage and overclocking the real way. 4.5 was stable at 1.33, and 4.6 was stable at 1.360. However, when I tried to go for 4.7, I had to raise the voltage to 1.380 to boot, and I ran Prime95 for an hour, 15 minutes of IntelBurnTest, and then two hours of Prime95 before it BSOD'd. I tried it at 1.385, and it BSOD'd after 30 minutes of Prime95. So I set it back to 4.6/1.355, and that ran Prime95 all night.

Temperatures were at most 60 at 4.5, then 65 on the first try of 4.6. When I tried 4.7, it was idling at 35-50, Prime pushed it to 65, and IntelBurnTest had it up to 75 on some cores. After leaving the 4.6/1.355 running all night, temperatures were 60-65 across the cores. 

So here are my questions. First, even when not testing, with SpeedStep and EIST enabled, voltage stayed at what I set it to, as did frequency. I've heard that may be because it's an MSI motherboard, so what would you recommend doing about that? Is there any workaround?

Secondly, is it worth it to try to push the voltage to get to 4.7? I'm already prettu sure my gpu's the limiting factor, but I also do a lot of folding and cpu based renders. Would I be right in thinking that (a) the temperatures are too high and (b) there's going to be little difference?

First thing I noticed was on default settings, CPU-Z was detecting my stock Vcore at 1.305 V. After seeing so many posts about people managing to take their 3930Ks to 4.4 and beyond at that voltage, I tried some overclocking to see how far I could get with that Vcore. Unfortunately, I hit a wall pretty quickly at around 4.2, and then my Vcore requirements rose sharply. Trying both Offset and Manual voltage, I could only get 4.4GHz at 1.37V, along with Medium LLC, 120% current cap, and VCCSA and VTT at 1.1V. Temperatures in Prime95 SmallFFT hit 73C on the highest core, and around that temperature in IBT as well. I tried as high as 1.39V for 4.5, but that was still giving me instability, and I didn't want to go above 1.4V as I heard that was pretty much the wall for air cooling and for 24/7 overclocks.

Another problem was that I noticed far less BSODs when I have an unstable overclock, and more of just a system lockup when I run Prime95 or IBT. The screen just freezes and the keyboard and mouse stop responding, and I have to hit the power reset button.

* Idle Temps: ~40c
* On load temps: ~77-83c

I tested my 3.9 setup with 20 minutes of maximum Intelburntest.   
And 4 hours of prime95.

Now since this is my first time ever doing this, I just wanted you guys to check out my bios settings and see if there's anything glaring that i need to change to make it more efficient or possibly more stable to go up even higher.

Thanks in advanced.

**EDIT:** So I tweeked my setup including disabling Speed Step and changing some voltages.  I want to make my system run as safe and as stable as possible.  I like the current rating at 3.9 ghz.  But is there anyway to boost performance for gaming.  Some people say clock speed doesn't matter and that there are other things to tweet instead.  I'm looking for insight into how to optimize my current 3.9 setup as well as anything else I can do that will increase performance on my rig.  I'm pretty noob at over clocking so try to explain any comments as such.  Thanks guys.

I've been reading around that a GTX 680 fails to utilize an entire i5 3570k even at stock. What are the benefits to overclocking then? I use my computer mainly for gaming. 

In regards to overclocking, I've been running my i5 3570k at 4.3 GHz since I've had it. With Auto Voltage settings, it ran at 3.4 GHz @ 1.24v so I pumped up the GHz as high as I could without increasing the voltage. The temperatures stayed the same so that was my justification to overclock. Why I'm bringing this up now is the fact that I can run the processor at 1.00v at 3.4GHz. Is it worth it to OC to 4.3GHz @ 1.24v rather than run it at 3.4GHz @ 1.00v? I mean what differences will it make in gaming?

I looked around and found that many were successfully oc'ing their 560 ti's to 1ghz so I decided to start off slow with 915mhz and it seemed to be stable. I increased it to 925mhz and was liking the fps increase on mw3 and other games so I decided to try out Just Cause 2 (while over clocking with MSI afterburner, I was also keeping an eye out for my temps using gpu-z).The temperatures seemed normal for MW3, about 60c, but was surprised when I experienced a significant fps drop in Just Cause 2. Before the overclock I was getting 40 - 60 fps and was now getting about 20 - 30 fps. I noticed on gpu-z that my gpu core clock had gone down from 925mhz to 405mhz. I've read that some cards downclock during high temps to avoid damage but I wasn't experiencing any abnormal temps. After it started to downclock on its own, I decided to overclock 1 mhz at a time and it downlocks itself when I reach 905mhz. Is there's anything else I should be looking for, when overclocking? any help would be great. Thanks in advance.

When I run the burn test, my voltage is going all over the place, there's a .1v fluctuation.  Also, my voltage will be higher when I'm not using my CPU, staying at a round 1.33, I assume this is from my LLC but I cannot use anything lower than 5 for 4.5ghz (unless I start dumping more on the vcore, but I'd get the same effect).  

So, I dropped my clockspeed down to 4.3, turned off LLC (which doesn't seem to do anything on auto) and I tried using auto vcore, which seems to work better.  C state works and my voltage is below 1 when idle and doesn't go above 1.3 when fully loaded.  I'm really confused why I seem to be having so much vdroop and why auto works better/works with C state. 

Am I doing something wrong?  I only changed the LLC setting, my Vcore, and my multiplier.

Intel's Ivy Bridge CPUs were just released on April 29 here in Japan and I was literally the first person in the door at the only PC shop in town, demanding that they shut up and take my money. Previous CPU overclocking experience has been limited to seeing what I could squeeze out of a Core2 Duo E8400 (I managed a stable 4.2GHz), so I was salivating at the thought of fully unlocked multipliers. So I gutted my case and built a new system from scratch:

- Intel Core i7 3770K with Enermax ETS-T40-TB CPU cooler
- Asus Sabertooth Z77 motherboard
- Team Group Xtreem 1600MHz 4GB x4
- Enermax Modu87 800W power supply
- Sapphire AMD Radeon HD 7950 3GB (currently at stock speeds)
- Plextor PX-128M3P SSD for OS (Windows 7 Enterprise)
- Existing CoolerMaster Centurion case modded with inflow fan mounted in drive bays

One thing that should be noted here is the temps often peak at 80°C, so I'm not sure how much higher I can go with just air cooling.

I downloaded the beta version of MSI afterburner and it lets you go up to absolutely ridiculous settings (I think up to 1800 MHz, lol, in my dreams maybe). I found that this let me gain a whopping 25 more MHz without artifacts or any other problems. Yay! I have a new issue though- updating to the latest beta drivers seems to have lowered my performance in Heaven 4.0 and 3DMark. I got worse scores after updating than I did before even at the old settings. Is anyone else having this problem? Thanks again for all your input. 

So I have a MSI 7950 twin frozr edition. It's a great card and right now I have it running at 1200MHz at 1.225V. From what i've seen, that's pretty good. Stock settings for my card were 960 MHz at 1.125V. Temperatures hover at about 61-62C while running folding@home all day with 99% GPU usage, fans at 48-50%. I'm very happy that it runs so well at a very reasonable temperature at 1200MHz. I would think, though, that I could easily squeeze out some more speed, if only my overclocking software would let me. However MSI afterburner only allows me to go up to 1200MHz.

Does anyone know if there is a way to let me exceed this limit with afterburner, or is there a different program that has higher limits? CCC has overclocking controls but it goes no higher and at any rate MSI afterburner seems like it works better. I thought I saw something at some time about exceeding the default limits in afterburner, but I can't find it.

I knew there was a overclocking subreddit but you guys seem to mainly focus on sharing tips and helping people who are new to overclocking. I.M.O.G.'s AMA had me wondering if you guys would perhaps be interested in starting a team on hwbot. For those who haven't heard of us: we're a site were people can submit their benchmark scores and basically compete against eachother, solo or in team.   
   
It just so happens we're currently running our annual [Team Cup](http://hwbot.org/competition/team_cup_2013/), which would be a pretty good occasion to get noticed as a new team :). There are 3 main competitions, SuperPi 1M, 3Dmark03 and 3Dmark Vantage (There's a 4th one, but that one focuses on live performance). Each competition is divided in several stages, according to hardware ""era"".   
   
Aside from the Team Cup, there are other competitions in which you can win some pretty cool prizes: [EK Water Block](http://hwbot.org/competition/ekwb_contest/), [MSI 3Dmark challenge](http://hwbot.org/competition/msi_3dmark_challenge/) and [Gigabyte lucky draw](http://hwbot.org/competition/gbt_snake_prize_draw/).

Overall I would say it did ok, it never went over 79°C and I could really see a difference. But then I decided to test it with Kombustor to really see if it wouldn't get too hot and I got 85°C after 5 minutes, while it gets 77°C with the default settings. So I was wondering if it's too hot or if I'm ok keeping it at those setting.

Also, do cooling pads help? My laptop get's the air out by the side so I'm not sure if they would have the same impact on it. If they do work, should I overclock only when I get one? Or am I Ok as long as it doesn't get over 80°C?

Playing Borderlands 2 and Farcry3 would often times end with the game crashing. At one point I got a BSOD saying I had hardware failing.

But I am having trouble trying to get Asus bios to do what I want. 

What I did first was uninstall Ai suite and then disable turbo boost in the bios. Then I tried to increase the multiplier, but the bios won't let me go over 34 which is the default. Since that didn't work I thought maybe I had to disable OC tuner as well, but that didn't do anything. I have tried to look around the web for a solution to increase the multiplier but to no avail. It seems like the only way for me to increase the multiplier is to do it with Ai suite's TurboV EVO, but even then it only allows it to go as high as the programs deems fit. When TurboV EVO auto OCs, it will only go up to 42 multiplier and instead OCs the base clock, which I don't want. I'd just like to have a multiplier of e.g. 45 and a base clock of 100, but it won't let me.

Does anyone know what I could do to solve this?

Also one of the reasons for why I want to do a manuel OC is because for some reason TurboV EVO says it has OCed to 4.4 Ghz, but when I run programs like RealTemp or CPU-z and I run stress test, they say I am only running at 4 Ghz. Also the multiplier will not go over 39 in CPU-z even though it's set to 42. Can anyone explain why it does that?

I have a pretty decent setup now, nothing extremely overkill - but Im interested in overclocking and after spending days on days reading guides, Im unable to achieve anywhere close to the clocks other people are getting with my i5 3570k.
I dont have liquid cooling, just a coolermaster Hyper 212+.
The highest clock Im able to get before stuff starts exploding and freezing is 3.8ghz


Now, I dont know if this is limited by my motherboard, or my PSU (which is the last part I am upgrading as its not too good)

(asrock x79 extreme6),8,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/13gk9m/3930k_vcore_and_load_line_calibration_question/,"Hello r/overclocking!  I recently put together a rig with a 3930k in it, and I've been messing around with some various OC settings.

Right now I'm shooting for 4.5ghz on a Corsair h100 cooler.  I'm currently running the vcore in offset mode with +0.050.  This whole offset stuff is strange and new to me.  Right now when I'm idle, I'm getting about 40C and 1.338 vcore.  Under 100% load, I'm at about 70 - 75C, but the vcore drops down to 1.28v... which seems nice because that means less heat, right?

**I was wondering how I can get the vcore to be more stable at 1.28v.**  If it were running idle at 1.28v as well then that would be pretty awesome.  I noticed the settings for LLC in the UEFI bios, but I'm not really sure what to change.  I think right now it's set to Level 5... and that's from using one of the Turbo OC template settings that are already in the bios.  I hear that level 2 or level 3 is what I want?  But if I were to set it to level 2 or 3, I would need to lower my vcore offset even more, right?  Otherwise my 100% load vcore will be higher?

I've done some googling but my searches have often ended in forum threads where there's no real clear answer, so now I turn to YOU!

Thanks! &lt;3

Edit: I might be getting better at google though, found this guide that might help me! http://www.hardwarecanucks.com/forum/hardware-canucks-reviews/51675-asrock-x79-extreme9-motherboard-review-18.html

**update** I think I have this working the way I want now.  I have LLC set to Level 2, and my vcore set to Fixed at 1.3v.  I get about 1.29 idle and 1.28 under 100% load.  Will start testing this OC with 24 hour stress tests this week to see where it ends up!  It runs a little warm under 100% load after 2 hours (like 75C...) but I live in the desert and it's always going to be around 27C ambient in the room.  I'm going to see how low I can get the vcore but I feel like 1.28v is already a blessing at 4.5ghz.

It figures that as soon as I publicly ask a question about this stuff I start finding the answers after hours of not finding anything... ;D

**update 2** managed to stress test in prime95 for 16.5 hours without any warnings.  Will do a 24 hour test when I have more time to dedicate to it, but it looks stable for now :)",,False,self,t5_2rfc8,1353450425.0,,,True,t3_13gk9m,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/13gk9m/3930k_vcore_and_load_line_calibration_question/,

So my board is a meager 4+1 and can't really raise the voltage all that well on my proc. At some point, voltage instability kicks in and the system starts getting LESS stable. But where?

Based on how my system has behaved so far, I think the best approach is to start at .05V above stock and work my way up in .05V steps, doing a little binary search thing to find the fastest frequency the system will successfully POST 3 times at. Write down all these voltage / fastest frequency pairs. Hopefully something resembling a parabola will emerge; I'll then go to the best two voltages and do it all again, this time in the smallest voltage steps my mobo will allow. The voltage that pushes the clock the farthest will be the ""winner"" and I'll do my OC against that.

I'll start with the CPU-NB first, then do the CPU main clock. That should get me what I want.

The highest vcore I have seen is 1.27 but it usually sits around 1.25. I believe this is pretty good for an overlcock and I am very happy with the results so far. Temps sit around 56-58 depending on the core, peak temps were 63 on one or two of them. I might just leave it at 4.3 if it's stable and not even try for 4.5 as I have heard there is a negligible difference, maybe I am wrong? Feel free to correct me here.

My real question is this, I can't remember where I heard this, I think it was a newegg tv video or something. However, I thought that to truly have a stable overclock you should be able to run a CPU stress test, Prime95 in my case, and also some kind of GPU benchmark, like Unigine Heaven. After about 12 hours of stable prime95 I loaded up Unigine and something surprised me, I was only getting about 15-20 fps when I am usually well over 80fps. This is with all settings on max, 1920x1200 res, extreme tess, etc. I have 2 EVGA GTX 680 in SLI. I will post pics later if necessary but I am currently at work. 

It didn't seem to have a problem running but the fps were so low, is this normal or should I be able to run a CPU bench at the same time as this benchmark and get normal results?

I'm making this thread because I suspect I've missed some key things along the way, and may be making some stupid decisions without knowing.

I'll list the key points I've come to, so please confirm/deny and point out holes in my logic/knowledge as I go. 

* Haswell has been pretty disappointing for desktop PC users, and sounds like it is particularly bad for overclocking. I'm considering getting an Ivy Bridge 3570k instead. The idea is to overclock a 3570k until it matches or beats a 4670 in performance. 
* Since the performance difference between Haswell and Ivy Bridge isn't that big, I'm guessing this won't require a terribly ambitious overclock. I'll be trying to overclock on air cooling.
* I'm considering a Noctua NH-U12P for CPU cooling, as I hear it's one of the better air coolers out there with a good balance of cooling and noise. I want the performance boost from an overclock, but I also don't want my computer sounding like a jet engine, which is why I don't intend to be very ambitious about it.

Here are the bits I'm most confused about:

* I heard out about overclocking using offset CPU voltages, which I *think* allows the CPU to ramp up to an overclock under load, but then bring itself back down to lower clock speeds/voltages when idle. This is a type of overclocking I haven't done before (I'm currently running on an overclocked phenom II, but it's running on a fixed CPU voltage) but I would like to do it with the 3570k because I want to manage heat/noise levels as well as not be too hard on the CPU itself.
* I'm considering getting an Asus P8Z77-V LK motherboard to go with the 3570k. Is this motherboard capable of the type of overclocking I have in mind?

Computer Freezes then Unfreezes with a beep

Try HDD Tests

Go back to previous BIOS

Freezing is gone, requires regular 1.28v to keep 4.5ghz stable ( Not sure yet ,  running prime95 however before a -0.005v offset gave me 1.248v peak, now its back to the regular 1.272v peak ) Note I redid all the bios settings exactly the same

So is my motherboard faulty or what, if the CPU can run stable at that voltage it should be fine? Games never froze, only froze outside of games. Happens to my Asus Laptop aswell. Issue is clearly related to the BIOS update

(That's probably more info than needed.  I'm sure the other shit in there isn't important to an OC (HDD, Optical, etc.)

At x18.5 (3700) it will run for about 15 minutes only before a BSOD showing 0x124 which I read indicates increase/decrease QPI/VTT first, if not, increase/decrease VCore.  I *think* QPI/VTT refers to NB voltage control?

If I drop my multi to 18.0 it runs Prime for an hour.  I am fully aware that I will have to run for a lot longer before accepting a stable clock.  

I was really hoping to hit 3.8 on air.  If that succeeds, I'll start buying parts for a quality WC loop.  I'd love to eventually hit a stable 4.0.

I have the following sitting in front of me ([Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Gbte55x.jpg)) and I'm curious how much heat this can dissipate, should I re-purpose it.  I'd like to get creative and attach this to a video card and have it exhaust heat outward (perpendicular to the mobo), but want to know how to calculate the max it can handle to know if it would outperform the current HSF.  In any case, knowledge on effectiveness of heatpipes would be valuable in general, so I thought I would ask.

Background on it: it's a pull from a P4 laptop.  Unfortunately, I do not know what model it was since I pulled it a long while back, but I remember using it on and off and it was a space heater.  I would venture a guess that it was a Mobile P4 (not P4-M), rated at ~85W, so I know this should dissipate at least that much.  

Thanks,

I'm a long-time computer enthusiast and I'm familiar with the concepts of overclocking, but I've only just started getting my feet wet. My build is as follows:

- Intel Core 2 Quad Q9400 @ 2.66 GHz (with Scythe Ninja 3B cooler)
- 4 GB DDR2-1066 RAM
- nVidia GeForce GTX 460 (1 GB GDDR3)
- 650 W PSU

Last night I installed my cooler, and I decided to try it out with a modest overclock of 80 Hz, or 3%. For a stock FSB of 333 MHz and a (locked) clock multiplier of 8.0, that equates to a new FSB of 343 MHz.

It successfully boots, but it errors on an OCCT stress test within 5-10 minutes. Temperatures under full load are approximately 50° C.

I understand that the next step is to bump up my Vcore until it passes the stress test, I reach the maximum recommended Vcore (1.36 to 1.40 V), or the maximum recommended temperature of 71° C. 

Is this normal? I would've expected to get more than 10 Hz FSB before needing to increase the Vcore. Is it possible that my CPU is damaged or some other factor is affecting this?

Also, if there's anything wrong with my methodology, please let me know!

I already have an corsair h70 cooler setup to help control any temperatures. I'd mostly be happy running at 4.0, just to help with video processing and streaming.

I'm going to say this now- I'm very new to this. I've been doing a lot of reading but following most of the info I do get confused at times. I've been trying to follow with the calculations, but other guides suddenly want me to change one of the values and I'm beginning to wonder if I have to other calculations once that value changes.

I'll start off with some detailed information.

I'm currently using the EVGA x58 SLI 132-BL-E758  
Intel Core i7 920 Bloomfield Socket 1366 LGA Revision C0/C1  
Memory is 24gb Kingston Hyper X Blu KHX1600C10D3B1K2, @1600  
The Memory timings for these cards are here in the spd  http://imgur.com/a/X3CKh

Now from what I understand, I need to pull the timing I need, depending on the frequency I decide to run the memory right? Which Timing table should I be using? According the the bios it uses 7,7,7,20- but should I be changing that depending on my memory frequency?

I get into CPU VTT and Vdimm. It's suggested I try to aim for CPU VTT to be no less than 0.45v of Vdimm. Vdimm on my setup is at 1.500 from the memory specs, which on my board means CPU VTT should be no lower than 1050. On my board, it’s default CPU VTT is +0 which is 1.100v. So by going by this logic my VTT should never pass -0.5

My default vcore is 1.26875V. Reading about the safety features I have an option of using Vdroop I can apparently just set this to auto. It will help with high strain voltages- however idle voltages will be higher than if I manually set my vcore lower, while eliminating vdroop. Do any of you have experience with vdroop?
So moving back to CPU VTT- I should start at something simple like 1.3v
Now with turbo mode, I can stay at a multiplier of 20x, but this settings will require more vcore at the same cpu speed, so I might change the multiplier to something else with turbo off. People have been suggesting 19x or 21x for best stability. I will stay at 20x with turbo on for now, and I can always play with settings later.

I may also turn HT off for now- just to get stable readings.

CPU Uncore should be set to 2x my DRAM Ratio. I’m not sure what my memory settings are at this point- but I believe it runs the frequency at 2:8 be default, so my uncore should be 16x.

Then I simply play with the cpu host frequency to get a small increase in speed. I’m aiming for something around 3.2-3.4 just to start playing with stability.

I can always aim for lower voltages and better speed and move onto memory first- but I want to make sure I’m able to maintain stability at this junction before introducing different sources of instability.

I think this is the right way to go about it at least- let me know if I have anything wrong and if you guys are able to help me identify the proper memory timings.

Two years later though, it isn't as fast as it was and I am getting the itch to overclock again! So a couple of questions:

* Is it safe to run a system at max OC (4.2Ghz for a 1090T) for every day usage?
* Will I notice a difference in speed?
* Would it be worth buying an SSD? (I know its not OC related)

3570k 4.5ghz 

Gene V

TX750V2 PSU

Okay so first off I had a good solid overclock of +0.010v, this passed 24 hours of prime no problem. I have it at 1.7PLL. I never saw the max vcore in hwinfo report higher then 1.280v. Faster foward a week ago. I switch from a cracked version of windows 8 to a legit  version. I had done many updates on the cracked version so it shouldn't make a difference. Anyway, I had just sold my GPU and was using iGPU. Decided to make sure my OC was still stable. I did 3 overnight prime tests and they all hit 1.288v max vcore. This was using the same offset.

Now I contacted JJ, Asus' ROG demonstrator. He said it was either CPU degradation causing the CPU to raise its VID or the iGPU. He said he doubted it was degradadtion because the Vcore wasn't that high, and the temps and chip were faily new and low.

So I get my 780 GTX, a which uses more power then my previous 680 GTX. Prime results hit 1.288v The only difference between two cards is the power draw and the fact the 780 is running in a 16x slot. I had my 680 in the 8x SLi Slot.

Now I checked my event logger, at some point when testing my GPU Oc and playing games ( had alot of GPU driver crashes due to unstable gpu clocks) Now I had no whea errors after the 10 hour overnight test but I had 2 errors while testing the games. Prior to this hole mess I had 0 in nearly a month. I did a few quick prime tests while running a GPU clock program and it crashed once ( Not prime, the GPU Drivers ) 

So is my chip degrading or is something else going on here


Update:

well I decided not to reformat and just test once more with the new settings ( pretty much same as before ) 31 wheas.. I must have changed a setting wrong or something, this isn't close to being stable. Could temps affect my wheas? normally I get 75-80c, today I did a day run and got to max of 85c.

I have one question for you guys. I know about the feature of my MoBo where my CPU Vcore drops when my rig is in idle to save power. My Vcore does drop to around 1.0xx - 1.1xx. My Multiplier also changes from 42 to 16. However, it constantly changes back and forth between 42 and 16 every second. My question is, is that fine?

As I understand now(never had more than 2 cores before), 8 core CPU is pretty terrible for gaming. Most games do not utilize all the cores properly leaving me with performance drops very often. As many of the reviews said, was the cpu was the bottleneck of the system, and now I can see that. The thought of having an 8-core cpu was a childish idea that made me choose this pc.  

My question is, is there anything I can do to improve this? Most games I run have some issues. Games like BF3, Red Orchestra 2, Bioshock Infinite, and other new-ish games, will have some performance drops like 20-30 fps on med-low settings which really ruins it for me.  

During a quick game of Red Orchestra 2(which came out 2 years ago) I recorded some of my system stats. First thing I noticed is that most of the cores are not always being used, but also not even the cores being used(typically 1 or 3) will only be used to about 70% on average. The GPU is also only at 50%-60%. I'm wondering if its possible to maybe overclock to improve this or what can I do to help with an 8-core CPU with gaming?

Now, it's all dependent on what the newegg prices are when I go to pick it up (which will be next Friday), but I thought I'd ask the oc-gurus on which one will handle overclocking better.

I want to keep the cost of the mobo with the $40 discount around 95-115. Here's the ones that I'm considering:

http://www.microcenter.com/product/387556/GA-Z77X-UD3H_LGA_1155_Z77_ATX_Intel_Motherboard

http://www.microcenter.com/product/389357/P8Z77-M_PRO_LGA_1155_Z77_mATX_Intel_Motherboard

http://www.microcenter.com/product/401766/Z77A-GD65_Socket_LGA_1155_ATX_Motherboard

(And of course) http://www.microcenter.com/product/387554/Z77_Extreme4_LGA_1155_Z77_ATX_Intel_Motherboard

I want to shoot for anywhere between 4 GHz and 4.4 at the max. I know that my H60 is going to be the limiting factor, so I'll be more than happy with an overclock of 4.2, but if I can go higher, I'd be happy.

EDIT: Before somebody says that /r/buildapc would be a better place for this post, the reason why I'm posting here is to know which of these boards are getting better real world overclocks.

My problem is my motherboard is an MSI Z77A-G43 and my voltage options are very very limited.  My vdroop is insane.  It droops down to 1.14V at full load in IBT.  Yea almost 20% drop in voltage.  At 4.8ghz the droop causes it to crash.  This board has absolutely NO LLC options.  NONE! I can only offset voltage overclock as well.

So I'm exploring new motherboard options. 

My pricepoint is $200 and I've looked at these so far but I'm open to options.  Please recommend to me your favorite Z77 board for more advanced overclocking.

The primary use will be gaming. It will be water cooled, and (obviously) I plan on overclocking it to get it as far as I possibly can while remaining stable. The main question I guess is which chip has the greater overclocking potential, and which would be the better option to build a powerhouse PC around? Or is there another I should be looking at?

Since the default voltage is so high would it be safe to have the voltage above 1.5v for permanent use?

starting overclocking my gpu, using furmark i was getting no returns at all lol. so switched to unigine.a gigabyte 7950 btw

at 1000/1350 42.2 average
at 1100/1450 46 
at 1100/1500 46.2 

It didnt go above 60 in unigine (17c ambient) but in furmark it goes to about 64 i would think.

Okay, it seems 1100/1500 doesnt like furmark so much meaning not that stable :/ would adding voltage help this? what kind of voltage is considered not much for the 7950, i dont want to overvolt so much.

Sure enough my CPU-z was showing 3.6 and in the bios when I restarted. However, I noticed another setting which intrigued me a bit when i was under the Vcore and that was offset voltage, and read about it a bit and it seems like a solid thing to do for overclocking, lowering the voltage or raising it when needed rather than a feeding the same voltage no matter what you are doing like fixed voltage.

Installed a bunch of tools and benchmarks (EVGA Precision X, MSI Afterburner, Nvidia Inspector, Heaven Benchmark, 3Dmark 11) and experimented a bit. I read somewhere that it should be able to do +135mhz on the core clock so I tried that and got a white screen on Far Cry 3 and a lower framerate on Borderlands (I used games before Heaven, and decided to change because they weren't as reliable.) 

Then I tried around and found that it worked using EVGA, when set to +116 on the core and +215 on the memory, which gave me a 950mhz core speed. However, that was actually a factory locked ""boost speed"" (the standard core clock is 835 mhz) and though it did give me a higher result in Heaven (about 3 fps higher on average), it wasn't true overclocking. I booted up Saints Row 3 to test if it gave a considerable rise in fps there, and suddenly I noticed I had raised 7-10fps on ultra. Checking the core speed, I saw it was at 1066mhz, the desired +116. Heaven showed promising results, about the same rise according to the framerate counter, but I was unable to do a benchmark due to some intervention I cannot recall.

Now whenever I try to recreate this magical, glitch free, crash free overclock it juststays at 405 (idle speed) and 835 (standard speed), despite using the exact values. This was a problem in the beginning, and I don't know what was different in those magical 950 and 1066 clocks where it did get past the barrier, but now I'm back at the beginning. I tried small overclocks such as +1, +10, +20, +50 but it just stays at 835mhz like nothing is wrong. Am I forgetting something? The programs do not let me change the voltage, I didn't really mention the memory clocks because I don't think they affect it much, I tried around +200 and just leaving it at standard, but neither allows me to recreate, not even +215 which was what I used in my best run. 

P.S. Please no comments as in ""laptop overclocking no good heat problems"". I have thought about this, I am not planning to use it for long gaming periods as I am not a graphics freak, I just want to see what my laptop is capable of. If you can help, do it, otherwise leave it.

I finally got to do some overclocking today, and honestly i only a bit of a clue in what I'm doing. I'm not new to computers, but yes to overclocking. I've read several guides, and been following this in particular:

http://www.overclock.net/t/1291703/ivy-bridge-overclocking-guide-asus-motherboards


Although I haven't done much stress testing, everything seems rather normal except for temps when i stress test. Before overclocking, i Idled at 20 or 21C. Now it seems to be 25-30C. Doesn't seem to bad to me. I'm using the 3770k on a Noctua NH D14 @ 4.5GHZ. I'm using Prime 95 to test, and when stress testing, I reach temps up to 95C within 30 seconds. I dont know if i should turn my CPU down or if this is normal. How long should i stress test for? I've read all the way up to 12 hours?

Specs: 

-CPU: Intel i7 3770k @ 4.5GHZ

-CPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D14

-Motherboard: ASUS Sabertooth z77

-GPU: MSI R7950 3GB OC Edition

Hope someone can tell me if this is bad or not.

TL;DR Attempting overclock i7 3770k first time. Seems stable, but reaching 95c temps from prime 95 within 30 seconds.

Edit 1: I just noticed that Core voltage is jumping a bit. It goes anywhere from 1.168 to about 1.25 something.Not sure if this is crucial to temps.

Edit 2: Someone notified me that i was on offset mode and advised me to go to manual mode and turn down voltage. I'm now booted into windows at 1.3v (as opposed to the previous 1.35v), but haven't done stress testing. 


Edit 3: I'm not going to lie/hide it. Honestly , i cannot fully remember the @100% load temps for my stock cpu. I was saying 60c as a safe limit. I know this is crucial, but i dont normally check temps while in game. Usually like a minute afterwards. I never had any problems gaming though.

Edit 4: I don't know why, hopefully this isn't a huge problem, but i went straight ahead from 1.28 to 1.24. Prime 95 crashed within 30 seconds but no blue screens. I went to 1.25v and temps were at 65c average on cores 1, 3, 4, but 75 on core 2. I dont know if this is odd. Unfortunately, however, i got a BSOD within 5 minutes. I read online that code 3b suggests to increase the vcore. Should i got to 1.26v? I might reapply thermal paste tomorrow. Is 60-80c in prime95 bad, good, or normal? thank you so much guys!

UPDATE:
Prime95 test @4.5ghz vcore 1.26v no crash for 10 minutes. Max temps 67, 81, 76, 70. I read ivy bridge can run a bit high at times? Is this is a stable overclock? :D I'm starting to get the hang of this i think.

I've gone ahead and read/noted things from this guide: http://www.thinkcomputers.org/intel-ivy-bridge-overclocking-guide/. 

There's one bit that's really unclear to me at the end (page 3)... It says if there were no boot problems or BSOD errors, to increase multiplier by 1, and then later states, ""Continue these two steps until you are at the clock speed you want, within the required voltage settings, and aren’t going over 90C."" So my misunderstanding here is whether or not ""these two steps"" includes ""First, set your VCC offset to +0.005v if you’re using offset, or set the VCC voltage to 0.005v higher than stock if you’re using fixed,"" as I plan on using offset.

At what point do I further increase VCC offset? Any suggestions past what the guide gave me? What should I aim for? I've seen people commonly post within 4.2 - 4.4 GHz stable overclocks for the i5 3570k - can I achieve that? What voltages would that entail? How do I know if the voltage is too high for the current overclock?

Thank you for any help.

1356455365.0,8,self.overclocking,15fcal,Current Overclock for i5 3570K/7970: Good Enough or Push Further?,9,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/15fcal/current_overclock_for_i5_3570k7970_good_enough_or/,"Alright fellow Redditors, here's my situation:

Running an i5 3570K, I've pushed it to 4.5Ghz using (IIRC) +0.005 Offset and +0.008 Turbo Boost voltages. Beyond that multiplier and serious stability issues occur, and raising the Turbo up above +0.02x didn't seem to resolve the issues, so I backed off. I'm not knowledgeable about voltages yet, and didn't want to risk bricking something by pushing values I didn't understand very well. I followed [this](http://www.overclock.net/t/1198504/complete-overclocking-guide-sandy-bridge-ivy-bridge-asrock-edition) guide.

I've also got a Radeon 7970 Ghz Vapor-X. It's pushed to 1180 from 1050 using stock voltage/power. Beyond that, stability issues or artifacts occurs. I don't know how best to bump up power, what limits to set myself (so I don't go too far and damage the card), and how much more I can push the overclock on whatever extra voltage I give it. Temps aren't the roadblock; an aggressive fan profile and the cooler from Sapphire have kept me from hitting 70C under full load. I followed this guide: http://www.overclock.net /t/633816/how-to-overclock-your-amd-ati-gpu **EDIT:** Sorry, link is not appearing unless I add a space in.

Is this a good overclock or, knowing what I've outlined, can I safely push it a bit further? If so, how would you recommend I do that?  I would greatly appreciate any advice you guys can share.

My computer is specced out below for reference.

Advice?,7,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/14b14r/started_oc_today_are_these_temps_good_one_error/,"So I finally decided to put my Hyper 212 EVO to the test after a few months of using standard settings. 

I honestly didn't know much about OCing so I did a bit of research and watched a few youtube videos.

- My standard settings at 100% load, max temp was below 50c and the core voltage was around 0.9 

- I figured this was good so I decided to OC to 4.2 with offset at -0.065. It worked fine and the temp did not rise over 60c. Voltage was around 1.0-1.05

- Decided to bump it up to 4.4 (think i'll stay there unless persuaded) First I thought that keeping the offset at -0.065 would work fine, but it didn't get past the start screen. So then I set it at -0.015.

Been running Prime95 while typing this.. everything works fine, but one errors. Any advice?

I feel like this is high and I haven't really lowered the offset yet to see how low I can push it. The minimum idle I have seen us 0.952v, hovering around 1.1v at idle.
 
The weird thing with this Offset clock, is I am unable to ever get it to get past the ""Starting Windows"" screen if I try to go above 4.2Ghz. I have tried changing around the offset to a + number and go higher, but I have never gotten it to. I don't want to keep pushing it and have my vcore go way above 1.5v for it to boot.
 
I also tried Fixed voltage, and am able to get a 4.5Ghz clock while at 1.335v fixed. It will sometimes push up to a vcore of 1.4v while running that under Prime95.
 
I am trying to get a feel for how low should I push the offset on the 4.2Ghz offset to achieve some low voltages, but also want to know why I am unable to push it above 4.2Ghz and even get past the boot.

When I look through my OC profile in Trixx I see that the program automatically reduces the voltage to the card, even though I repeatedly save a higher voltage.

* GPU clock 1200 (factory 1000)
* Menomry clock 1400 (factory 1200)
* Board power 20%

I set all the turbo ratios at 43 and set the Vcore on normal with a +.005V dynamic vcore.

I am confused about why I am getting the voltages I do based on these settings. The Vcore on normal is set at 1.165V and that's what the BIOS says it's at too. At idle in CPU-Z, it fluctuates from 0.685V to 1.15V. During Prime95 it goes up to 1.28V. Max temps were 65-70C.

So is 1.165V what it is at 3.4GHz and 0.685V is when it's underclocked? Why does it go up to 1.28V though? I would have guessed it would have gone to 1.170V (1.165V + 0.005V from the dynamic Vcore).

My card is a Gigabyte Radeon HD7970 (OC edition), which comes with a core clock freq of 1000MHz. Yet, I'm not able to get a stable overclock - that works for everything - above around 1050MHz. I can get Heaven 3.0 to run stable at around 1083MHz. Sleeping Dogs seems to crash with anything above 1050MHz.


I haven't touched the core voltage yet, and would prefer to avoid that.  I'm using MSI Afterburner (and GPU-Z to monitor). The Power Limit slider is set to max (+20), which I understand should help to get a more stable overclock.


Is this normal? I was under the impression that you could clock this card to 1100-1200MHz without problem, and without touching voltages?

I decided to pick this up to replace an old Danger Den TDX that was not performing while overclocking my i5 3570k.  According to a couple sites ([MLL](http://martinsliquidlab.org) and [Pure Overclock](http://www.pureoverclock.com/Review-detail/xspc-raystorm-cpu-water-block/) the Raystorm performs similarly to other top line blocks but at a lower cost.  I was able to purchase the Intel version from [Performance PC's](http://www.performance-pcs.com/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=32331) for $50 USD.  This is pretty cheap as most other blocks will run at least $75.


*Performance*


Upgrading from an old Danger Den TDX (for single/dual core) I was able to shave off about 10C.  Currently, I am running my 3570k at 4.4GHz 1.20V (LLC 1).  My maximum temperature in IBT is 82C and Prime95 84C (8k FFT).  


*Features*


The mounting solution is easy to use and seems well made.  It consists of a low profile metal backplate to secure the mounting screws and springs. Included in the Intel package are backplates for the 2011/1366, 1155/1156, and 775 sockets.  This is a nice addition and lets you use this block on most modern Intel sockets.


**XSPC Raystorm GTX 670 Waterblock**


I decided to buy this block for my MSI GTX670 OC (reference nVidia short board) because the alternatives like Aqua Computer, Heat Killer, and EK didn't look as good to me.  (The AC GTX 680 block looks beautiful, however, and may fit some GTX 670's with a long GTX 680 board) .  I picked this block up off [Performance PC's](http://www.performance-pcs.com/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=34906) for $100 USD.  This is a little below average as most other full cover blocks will run around $120.  


*Performance*


My card was running pretty hot on the stock cooler at around 80C-90C while playing games like BF3.  After mounting this block, the card sits at about 50C-52C under load.  On an overclock to 1321MHz core clock brings the temperature up to 55C maximum.


*Features*


The block comes with a bunch of thermal pads to cool the memory and another bank of small chips.  These pads are a little annoying to mount because they are not sticky and slide around while mounting the block.  Aside from that, the mounting is easy and straightforward.  It does not utilize a mounting bracket, so the screws should not be tightened too aggressively. 


The best part of the block is the 7 way port that allows you to place fittings in any direction you want.  They have two ports facing the top of the card, two facing outward, two facing downward, and one facing toward the power plugs.  The port facing the power plugs is useless, however, as the two PCI-E plugs block any chance of a fitting fitting in there.  XSPC includes 5 end plugs to block the rest of the ports.


**Pictures**


[link](http://imgur.com/a/3MwcH)


The block looks great with the lights and matches the GTX 670 block perfectly.  Unfortunately, I didn't take pictures of the CPU block before installation.  Each block includes two LEDs which can be inserted into predrilled slots in the block.  The CPU has 4 LED holes and the GTX 670 block has 2 LED holes.  The LEDs spread the light well through the acrylic.  The LEDs look slightly darker almost with a hint of purple.  


The delerin block with the port holes on the GTX 670 is not actually scratched and dirty looking when it is delivered. My camera is just crappy.

I stopped before they could get any higher.

This is the computer I built. I would like to know what is the best guide to overclock.

I will be using this computer for gaming mostly and some java/android programmation.

I seriously have no clue where to start. I found a guide (http://www.overclock.net/t/1198504/sandy-ivy-bridge-complete-overclocking-guide-asrock-edition), but I am not quite sure how to use all the different programs.

Can you guys help me ?",,False,self,t5_2rfc8,False,,,True,t3_xtvc0,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/xtvc0/just_build_my_computer_where_should_i_start_to/,

I'm curious as to *how* these numerical changes in the BIOS affect the hardware components to operate differently. As an example of what I'm looking for, what is going on when I change a multiplier from 9 to 10? Is the processor looking directly for that number in the firmware/BIOS to be told how to operate? How does it know to look there? 

Overclocking guides to an excellent job in explaining what to change to get a desired effect, but it seems that nobody really knows, or cares to explain, why the hardware responds in such a way.

Any clarification on this would be much appreciated.",,False,self,t5_2rfc8,False,,,True,t3_x264u,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/x264u/what_is_actually_happening_when_you_overclock_a/,

Honestly, I'm kind of confused. I'm going to post what I've learned here and hopefully you guys can help fill in some blanks =)

**Note: I don't want to push any super high end numbers. Stable, yet effective clocks are great.**

CPU:

Before hand, i'm going to download [Prime95](http://www.majorgeeks.com/Prime95_d4363.html),[ CPUid](http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html), and [Real Temp](http://majorgeeks.com/Real_Temp_d6098.html)
I'm going to go into the BIOS, and set the multiplier to 45 and the Vcore to 1.3. Then I'm gonna run Prime95 for 8 hours. I don't really know anything about this Prime95 program, and I'm struggling to find a how-to guide. However, while running this Prime95 thing, I'm under the impression that I am to use Real Temp to ensure that my PC temp doesn't reach over roughly 63 degrees Celsius. If the temps stay stable, i'm gonna try to lower the Vcore (to what?) and try again, making sure it stays stable. I'm under the impression that the lower the Vcore the better, is that correct?

Also, what is CPUid for? Just to show my Vcore/Speeds or what?

Video Card:

To OC the GPU, I'm gonna quote my good friend (well, I creep his posts because he's incredibly knowledgeable when it comes to this card) Azov237:

* Uninstall your current display drivers.
* Reboot into safe mode
* Run Drive sweeper to remove all display drivers(including intel)
* Reboot
* Download the 12.4 Beta drivers (quick google search)
* Install only the display driver with no other addons. DO NOT install CCC.
* Reboot
* Download and install Asus GPU tweak 2.08
* Reboot
* Open up GPU tweak for the first time. On the bottom left there are three tiny buttons on the side. Click the middle Octogon to enable Advanced mode.
* Go to the settings tab, under the second tab(I think its called advanced) Check unlock GPU voltages. Check the box that says Overclocking enhancment.
* Save
* Reboot
* Open up GPU tweak, and it should have everything unlocked. 

After this, i don't really know what to do. I don't really understand what the numbers mean (like 1275/1500) or how to test stability. Could really use some help here.

Here's my build for reference:

The problem I'm having is that my mobo (bios ver F9) doesn't have all of the features for overclocking (LLC, setting vcore, System agent voltage) and all I have to adjust is DVID, BLCK and VTT/QPI.  
  
__I ran prime95 small FFTs in my first test:__     
DVID: -.06v  
Multiplier: 42x  
VTT/QPI: 1.10v  
BLCK: 1002 (for 100.2mhz)  
  
here's a screen: http://i.imgur.com/ci7Qr.jpg  
I noticed using EasyTune6 that before stress testing my vcore was at 1.296 but after ~8 hours (and immediately) it dropped to 1.272v  
No hiccups or BSOD after/during this test.  
  
__Test#2__  
dropped Dynamic Vcore to -.07v to test a lower voltage.  
results: http://i.imgur.com/h2XHG.jpg  
This time after 8 hours p95 the voltage dropped to 1.260v from 1.296v  
  
I feel like I'm doing this wrong, but I'm getting a stable system though. What can I adjust? further drop DVID? lower QPI/VTT?  
  
__Other information:__  
both times temps hover 63 - 65. Cooler Master 212+  
What I don't understand is that the initial voltage was 1.296 for both tests and they dropped under load. I read various things about vdrop and vdroop and how they can be improved with LLC. (though mobo doesn't have this)
I also have ram OCd to 1600 with timings 9/9/9/27 with a DRAM of 1.6  
C1E - disabled  
C3/C6 - disabled  
thermal monitor - disabled  
EIST - off  
  
running win7 64bit and Lion  
  
I think I covered all of my bases here. Let me know if you need anymore information.  
Thanks!!

After running Prime95 for 12 hours without any crashes, I went ahead and applied the settings to the BIOS again. This time, I only needed 1.45v and it seems that this motherboard automatically adjusted the Bus Speed and HT Link ever so slightly on it's own. I'm honestly not quite sure about that because I never change those settings myself.


With a CM Hyper 212 EVO, idle temps are at 34C and on a Prime95 load, it maxes out at 52C. When I play Black Ops with everything maxed out on a 1920x1080 monitor, temps max out at 42C.

More Updates:

I managed to find a brand new, unopened Corsair H80 on Craigslist for $80 bucks today (I had to jump on it, such a great deal) and my idle temp has dropped to 30C and on a Prime95 load, it maxed out at 48C. This thing is amazing. I highly recommend it.

Recently upgraded from a pair of 8800GTS in SLi (they rocked) to a GTX 570. Immediately I notice I can run the few games I couldn't max before at max.

However I seem to be vastly underperforming in benchmarks. In Heaven 2.5 I am getting less than half of what I've seen others post. I knew my Q6600 would be a bottleneck but I didn't think it would be this significant. I also believe my RAM is only 800MHz.

I will upgrade the rest of my rig to suit my card more, but that won't be for 6 months or so. In the meantime I'm wondering what the biggest bottleneck I'm facing is. I've also found that in CPU-Z screenshots other people seem to have significantly different (higher) clock speeds than me on their Q6600, like double. I know they are overclocked but see from the [screenshot](http://imgur.com/nNPtN) it seems slow even for stock.

To be honest it's only the benchmarks I'm struggling on, as I play 1920x1080 it can still run everything I've wished to play at max settings, but I'm concerned if there's something I can do to improve performance for when I can't (I'm looking at you BF3). I've tried some of the motherboard's (ASUS P5N-D) built in overclocking on the CPU but it seemed to slow things down when I put it to even 2600MHz, and higher than that and I get stuck at a ""Detecting array..."" boot message.

Basically is there anything I can do to improve performance before my upgrade in a few months time? Any overclocking attempts I've made have failed miserably, like I'm doing something fundamentally wrong.

Thanks for any feedback. ^^

The two components to note are the Intel i5-2500k and the Gigabyte GA-Z68A-D3H-B3 motherboard I got. Now, being a noob, I got this board without thoroughly researching it's oc capability. The problem is, this board doesn't allow you to change vcore in the bios. It does auto-adjust, but not by enough. I got my CPU up to 4.3GHz on stock voltage, but 4.4GHz gives a prime95 error after 11 hours and 4.5GHz crashes on boot. I have a hyper 212 cooler which keeps me at 69C under max prime95 load, so I know I can go higher. I was hoping you guys could help me figure out a way to change the vcore, maybe from software? There is a BIOS update to F10 (I'm on F4), but I can't find any documentation on it so I'm not fond of the idea of flashing the BIOS just to check. I tried messing with Dynamic vcore but that didn't help. Any advice? I'm hoping someone with experience with this board can help. The thing that intrigues me is that while browsing forums, people with the same motherboard and CPU post frequencies of up to 4.9GHz in their sig, which I don't think is possible at the stock voltage.

Corsair H100 with Scythe Gentle Typhoon ap-15's in push

setting vcore, setting base clock to 100mhz instead of auto, setting multiplier, disabling EIST, turning on xmp for my memory.

any suggestions or general comments are very welcome, the furthest I've come so far in terms of (what my guess is) stability is 4,3Ghz @ 1.26Vcore, priming this further as we speak

First off. I am overclocking using Afterburner. I am mostly going off of how much i overclock, based off of how hot my card is on my games that i play. So far i have increased core by 160 mhz and memory by 70. Not knowing much, am i going to far? or barely any at all.


Also, one more thing, there is an option to change the ""Voltage"" on my card, but i haven't touched it since the program warns i can fry my card. Does voltage effect my performance, because if so, i would like to carefully, experiment.

I have [2x sapphire dual x 7970s](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814202008)

I started by bumping up the memory clock on both 7970s by 50 each time and running a loop of heaven. I saw artifacts at 1600 so I concluded 1550 was a good clock. I then set the memory back to 1450 and started bumping the core clock. I got the core clock to 1150 and ran the heaven loop 5 times then did 3dmark and played some bf3, all completely stable. Then I tried to go 1200 and my heaven wouldn't load and just went black screen.

So I tried to up the voltage because I checked and the vddc was at 1025, which I felt was low compared to what other people had their 7970s at. I bumped it up to 1.2V from 1.025V and tried to run 1200mhz, didn't work so I set it back to 1150 and restarted my computer to check if the voltages would stay the same. When my computer was turned on I was told ULPS must be turned off, so I did that and restarted again. I was using Sapphire Trixx to change the vddc, and CCC to change the clocks. I saw that Trixx had set the voltage back to 1.025V which was frustrating (I had all of the ""start with windows"" on Trixx settings checked) so I switched to MSI Afterburner. I increased the voltage to 1.25V and tried 1200mhz again. It didn't work so I went back to 1150 and suddenly I couldn't even open heaven without it crashing instantly, when 1150 was running great before, even though I had just increased the voltage from 1.025 to 1.25! So I tried 1100, no go, 1075, no go. At 1075 I could run heaven but I would crash in bf3, this is all at 1.25V. Finally I just set everything back to stock, 1025 VDDC and 1000 core 1450 memory. 

One thing to note is I watched gpu-z when running benchmarks and games and no matter what the voltage was set to the cards would only go up to ~1V and then crash after a bit, never actually moving to 1.2V. 

One more thing is I ran the bioshock benchmark before any overclocking, and had 108 average fps. After resetting the gpus and running it again, but keeping the CPU overclock I had just done, moving turbo on 3570k (I have questions on this later) to 4.4Ghz. I ended the benchmark with 100 avg fps, which is a solid -8% difference. Why would this be?

I'm not sure exactly what my question is, I just felt bad seeing my 1150 clock at stable at 1150 playing an hour of bf3 and running a bunch of heaven then crash in bf3 after ~45seconds at 1075. But since the used voltage wasn't changing, I am wondering if any of you have tips on how to get the voltage change or if there is any advice for my overclocking situation.

Complete nub with OC'ing and would rather be safe than sorry on a brand new build.. however I like to mess with things and the temptation to OC is a bit is too high. 

I'm running a 3570k as stock (3.4ghz) and I'd like to overclock this to 4.2ghz. Will this be completely safe? I've read you can safely overclock to around 4.7ghz so I want to be on the safe side. I use a MSI GD55 motherboard, which has an 'OC Genie' feature, apparently when I push this button it auto overclocks my CPU.. I don't know how this works but I don't want to mess around with it.

2) I have something called 'Intel Turbo Boost' that came with the mobo, which seems to OC up to 3.8ghz when my PC needs it. If I OC'd would this still further OC the CPU if it needed it? Is it safe? Should it/can it be disabled?

1) How do I overclock with this board? Do I need to use OC Genie? How do I know I'm doing it safely? Can I get to 4.2 without changing the voltage?

2) I got my Gigabyte 7950 800mhz graphics card today. I just ran FurMark and it says my core speed is 1000mhz. I opened up Catalyst, went into Overdrive and found 'Enable Overdrive' is already checked and it's at 1000mhz.. is this default?? Is this safe?

Back in 2009 I made my first PC build for a little over $1,000. Its done very well so far, but I've found that some recent games are getting severely bottlenecked by my CPU. (Such as PlanetSide 2 and Arma 3.) I've always had my eye on overclocking, but haven't really gotten serious about it until now. However, I've seen some mixed comments on overclocking my type of CPU (LGA 775, q9650 yorkfield) from saying it overclocks fine, to others saying yorkfields are hard to overclock. 

So first of all, is my system even suitable for overclocking at all? 

System Specs:

Secondly, is there any merit to some of the comments I've read that my chip specifically is hard to overclock, or will some trial and error and a nice guide get me through it?

Lastly, does anyone know of some really good guides for my setup? The only semi-decent one i've found is [this](http://www.overclockers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=515316) but it is a bit hard to digest all the information, and is well over 6 years old.

I was contemplating on trying to fit a Noctua NH-L12 without the top fan, but it technically goes up to 66mm, and I'm not sure if it'll work. Not to mention, it'll push up against and heat up the power supply.

Past that, I don't think many of the really low profile ones like the NH-L9i would be suitable. It's really not that big, and I think the heatsink would overheat quickly.

Memory: G.Skill Sniper Series 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-2133.

GPU: ASUS Radeon HD 7870 (Direct CU II cooling).

#PSU: Thermaltake TR2 650W ATX12v.

##Tools I use to OC are:
Catalyst Control Center (Mainly for GPU because i find the asus GPU tweak to be confusing).

MBO BIOS for my CPU/memory.

CPU-Z for CPU monitoring.

GPU-Z for my GPU monitoring.

#3D Mark Vantage for CPU/GPU testing (I used to use furmark but read that it wasn't the best for stability testing, something like that :$).

##Okay, so the problems I've been having were:
Any sort of CPU OCing that I've done causes my computer to load my desktop REALLY slowly on startup (like, 7 minutes), or just stick it in some form of a boot loop. If it's in a boot loop and i try to undo my OC through the BIOS it puts me in some sort of error loop immediately after I select the OC settings.
Also, when trying to OC my memory, I can't set it any higher than 1866Mhz. Why does this happen when my MBO can support 2133Mhz. and so can my memory? Even when set to 1866Mhz it causes my computer to go into a boot loop much like the CPU...
#GPU OCing seems to be the only thing that works for me so far... It runs stable in 3Dmark Vantage at a core clock of 1170Mhz. (I find it crashes on 1200Mhz.) and a mem clock of 1450Mhz.

I was also wondering what the method to get both the GPU clock and memory clock running (eg. find max value for both and just use that, or if its needed to get lower values for it to be stable).

My temps averaged around 69C, with a couple of the cores peaking at 73C.  My ambient temperature is fairly cool, so these numbers seem somewhat high to me.  Again, I'm new though, so I really don't know.

Another concern was that about every minute or two, I'd get an extreme but very short drop in voltage along with a massive spike in my CPUTIN (to 127C).  Some Googling revealed that other people were experiencing this too, so I suspect it's an OCCT issue.  I'm afraid to just leave it at that, though, so I'm hoping to find out if anyone thinks it's a hardware issue.

This isn't a question directly about overclocking, but I have a feeling you guys might be able to provide some insight. My application of interest is the Wii emulator, Dolphin.

When deciding if a CPU overclock will help with real world performance, it is often beneficial to determine if your CPU or your GPU is the bottleneck, or driving factor. How does one determine this? Monitoring GPU and CPU utilization during emulation shows CPU usage at ~60 % and GPU usage at ~40 %. Since both of them have room to use more resources, can it be concluded that neither CPU nor GPU are bottlenecking Dolphin? And if this is the case, what *is* the bottleneck? Or is it just unoptimized code which is resulting in suboptimal resource utilization?

And in general, am I still getting performance benefits of a higher clock speed when not at 100% CPU utilization?

Now i have overclocked my GPU and did a burn in test. WORKS GREAT! However i use ASUS GPUTWEAK, and i currently have my GPU on default because after about 9 hours of having it overclocked it finally decided to crash.  I own a HD7850 DirectCU II

its default's are -
GPU Clock = 860
GPU Voltage = 1075
Memory Clock = 4800

MY overclock settings -
GPU clock = 1010
Gpu Voltage = 1125
Memory Clock = 5424


The main question is, if i keep my GPU overclocked and it happens to crash randomly after a few hours does this damage my system or my GPU at all? I see no reason why it should crash. I did a burn-in 15 minutes and a lot of tests. Ran AMAZINGLY for the 6 or 8 hours it was up.

Second off here is my SPEC's for my pc, i am looking to overclock it but i AM VERY SCARED. I am trying to stream but to stream games such as planetside 2 i think i need to overclock a bit. Where should i go to do this? What are the risks involved? and is there any way to turn it back to default if it does happen to fail or overheat.

Most of the parts are arriving soon so I should have it built by early next week. Anyways, as you can see in the build, I haven't purchased an after market CPU cooler yet and I'm not sure which one I should get. I would like to push my system as much as I can with just air cooling. The most recommended seem to be the cooler master 212+ or the 212 EVO but I'm always weary of cheaply priced goods. Was just wondering if y'all had any recommendations, both cost effective and performance-wise.  

Also, I'm not sure if I chose a high enough wattage power supply. The estimated draw on my system at full load is 430W right now I believe. Is 650W going to be enough for overclocking my system? My PSU comes in tomorrow and I'd like to return it as soon as possible if it's not going to cut it in the long run.  

I'll likely answer some of my own questions reading all this material, but I'm just trying to get as much information as possible.

1352081423.0,4,self.overclocking,12n7kz,I want to OC a AMD Athlon II X4 645 (Stock 3.1 GHz)--trying to get better framerates for a horribly unoptimized game,8,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/12n7kz/i_want_to_oc_a_amd_athlon_ii_x4_645_stock_31/,"So from what I've searched up, people have been able to OC this thing to 3.8GHz when the stock GHz is 3.1.

However, I'm running a slimline PC ([Acer AX1420G-U5832](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:xsbCzRBDt0cJ:www.acer.com.tw/ac/en/US/content/model/PT.SGM02.002+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us))

Is it still possible to overclock this to a reasonable GHz w/o having to get any specific cooling devices?

My room tempature is never hot (I live in northern massachusetts), and when I put my hand over the vent where the [giant fan over my CPU blows] (http://www.russellcomputech.com/pics3/MDAceAX1420G-U5832b.jpg), it's VERY cool, even when playing games. It's almost as if my computer is putting 0 effort if I can't feel a bit of heat over there.

Also, the game that I'm trying to play specifically is Natural Selection 2. 
The devs did a really shoddy job w/ CPU optimization because they decided not to use Source engine and build the game ground up with their own engine, making their first game ever.

They are working on it, but I don't want to wait-- I'd rather have good FPS now, and have even better fps later.

I get 45 idle, 20 fps in heavy fights, 25-30fps while moving and doing shit in the game, all at the *beautiful resolution of 640x480 and all the graphics at the lowest*.

Since the main problem with their game is the CPU optimization, increasing my GHz would obviously fix my horrid framerate problem--it's happening to many other people too, people are saying you need to overclock your CPU or own an extremely new one.


My specs:

MCP61 Motherboard

AMD Athlon II X4 645 3.1 GHz (dur)

Radeon HD 5450 (I don't play games at high resolutions, so this is all I really need--this is also a low power consumption PSU-- only like 10 watts).

Apparently the i7s can not be undervolted and Crystal was lying to me. The BIOS does not show voltage info either.


According to CrystalCPUID My Voltages were set at .9875

Doesn't this seem SUPER low for an i7 clarksfield?

I followed this guide http://forum.notebookreview.com/asus-gaming-notebook-forum/401345-optimization-guide-asus-g51.html

and I'm already far below what he claims is the minimum stable undervolted limit. When I throttle my processor to 10%, it can still peak to 83C, which is why I am trying to undervolt it further. (yes i've dusted it)

I got this laptop from Newegg and am curious as to why/how it could have such a low voltage...

Wiki says my 'voltage' for the CPU is .65 - 1.40
Does that mean I can undervolt to a minimum theoretical .65V?

I'm still deciding on specific parts, it's more that I know the case I want and am looking at how much radiator capacity I can squeeze in so I'm thinking about how multiple loops might need to be set up.

I'm thinking of going with a 2-3x120mm rad in the roof (I would need to make some extra cuts to go from a 240mm to a 360mm though), and a 2x3(or 4 if it will fit)x120mm rad in the front of the case [similar to something like this.](http://www.watercoolinguk.co.uk/p/Magicool-Hexa-Radiator-720mm_20224.html)

What I was thinking was just using the top 240-360mm rad for the memory, mobo, etc. with a push/pull setup (if it will fit above the motherboard), and using some centrifugal blowers to feed the front 720mm+ rad with both the GPU and CPU in parallel on it.

I'm assuming starting out with a 3570K, 7970, and some heavily OC memory with a second 7970 added in later.

I was wondering what parts I should change to help facilitate overclocking. Specifically:

- Is the RAM at the right speed, or should I return my RAM (it was bought under 30 days) and purchase faster speed RAM, to accommodate the CPU being faster after OCing? How fast should the RAM be?
- Should I invest in high profile or low profile RAM?
- Should I invest in a different CPU cooling solution? I'm looking at the [HF100](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/corsair-cpu-cooler-cwch100) since it fits nicely into my case but it's definitely expensive. I know that the cooler the CPU is, the higher I can OC it, but any cheaper options would be appreciated. Right now my CPU runs at 30C when it idles and goes up to 45-50C when I play games.

First, sorry for my bad english, I'm 17 YO and got english as 3rd language in school for 3 years now. 

So It's the first time I overclock in my life and it's the first time I've build a not stock Cooling in my PC.


Today I've installed my new H80 in my PC:

Mainboard: ASUS Sabertooth P67 Rev3.0

CPU: Intel i5 2500k

Cooling: Corsair H80 Hydro

RAM: Corsair XMS3 DDR3-1333

PSU: Antec HCG620W

GPU: Sapphire R6870

After I installed the H80 the Core Temp was about 5°C hoter (40°C, not Overclocked); I've been wondering on this but after this I launched Prime95 and the Temp was on 60°C after 10 Minutes of testing. It's Summer so the Room temperature was about 25°C. 

After that I used this guide to overclock my CPU, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rUF8FgD62I

and the Temperature went about 80°C after 5 Seconds and I instantly stoped Prime95

Is it just the Room temperature, or may a problem with the mounting of the H80 or could it be that the H80 got a problem? Again I would like to apologize for my bad language and hope that someone understands my problem and may can help me out.

setup, mounted horizontally
Arctic Silver 5
ASrock extreme4
MSI 7850
Rosewill Challenger case

Basically I want to get lower temps so I can push my processor a little harder. Right now using RLutz's simplified guide for OC, I'm getting the above and reaching about 82c with prime95.
I have added a side fan on my case that blows air directly on the video card and right underneath the cpu cooler, and as I mentioned I added a pull fan to my hyper212. Could either of these be negatively affecting my temps? I've been reading that a puller fan may actually disrupt the airflow through a radiator or cooler and negate the effect of a second fan. The cooler fans blow directly upward into my top exhaust fan, I had turned the cooler under the pretense of heat rises, etc.

The other part of my question is: will upgrading to a Noctua or even an H80 give me enough of a temp drop to make an upgrade worth it?

* DRAM Voltage: Auto (RAM Voltage is 1.8v and the minimum I can set in BIOS is 1.85v)
* Multiplier: 9.0 (Max)

I ran the Prime95 'Blend' test for 24 hours and it came back with no errors. Before I move onto trying the Intel Burn Test, I want to make sure that everything is as it should be.

I have been increasing my offset voltage step by step, attempting to pass Intel Burn Test at 20 cycles.  I'm still unable at +0.060V, which I find strange seeing as I'm kind of uneasy pushing past 1.4V at load.  Here's a screen of [intel burn test after a few runs](http://i.imgur.com/JojMq.jpg).  On that attempt it failed after about 12 cycles.  

Now, when I do fail I've been trying to understand my BSOD code.  It's 0x116.  Which according to the list of overclocking BSOD's, refers to the graphics card?  I've only ever received this BSOD, from my first overclocking step to this 4.5GHz one. I'm keeping my 7850 at core clock right now (though I have pushed it wonderfully to about 1170/5800 @ 1.16V).  I've also found that it may refer to low North Bridge voltage.  Should I try to bump that up?  I haven't heard much of voltage increases in the NB itself.
  
I haven't heard of anyone else getting this particular BSOD while overclocking, and my voltage is already so high.  Am I doing something wrong? Do I have a ""bad"" chip?  

Thanks!  

Some BIOS settings:  
All clocks  
Multiplier: 45    
Base Clock: 100MHz (default)  
Voltage: offset - 0.060V   
LLC - Level 3   
DRAM - set to specified voltage (1.5), clock (1600) and timings (9-9-9-24).  

&gt;EDIT: An even weirder problem just happened too.  I decided to check my RAM since the BSOD is referencing north bridge.  I made a bootable USB stick for memtest and booted into it.  I'm told that Memtest should automatically start checking my RAM, but it doesn't.  It just sits there at the blue start screen.  The red memtest + is flashing, and it recognizes that I have 8083M of memory, but it's not doing anything.  Below my CPU it reads Settings: RAM as  
&gt;0MHz (DDR3 - 0)  
&gt;And in the center of the screen reads  
&gt;2828K e820 off  

&gt;Not sure what that's about.  

##Solved that edit: I was using an outdated version of memtest.  4.20 supports sandy bridge.  My RAM tested without errors.

###Update:  
I followed the settings [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/tckre/need_some_help_ocing_2500k_and_7850/c4lio5e), and was able to get a clock of 4.7GHz to pass 20 cycles of intel burn test at an offset of +0.035V (About 1.35-1.38 peak). However once I stayed at that clock and played some portal 2 for a few hours, I once again crashed with 0x116. This also happens if I run prime95 for about an hour.

Only replaced the stock one because the plastic screws on it were a joke).

I've never done anything related to over clocking, so I'm really unsure where to start or if it's safe. I want to overclock to 3.00/3.50 ghz, but I'm unsure if that's safe with what I have, and where my temp should be ideally (I would also need some temp monitoring software).

the memory is rated at 1600mhz, 1.65v, CAS 8. the motherboard is rated for 1333, 1.5v, and that's how the memory settings default. it also defaults to CAS 9. at first, all I did to change this was enable XMP. 1600 was set automatically, though the voltage remained at motherboard default rather than memory default and CAS remained at 9. it seemed to work fine for a couple of weeks, and then on every other boot (precisely every second cold boot, oddly) I would get a momentary bluescreen flash right before the windows logo and a reboot, and windows would start ok on the reboot. I checked the memory dump and reasons for the generated code vary so wildly that I decided to check memory as the first possible culprit. (my temps seem ok and that would be my next guess anyway)

I turned off XMP and set the speed to 1600 by setting the multiplier to 16. I turned off Turbo boost for memory (didn't even see that option there the first time). I also set the voltage up to 1.65, which my BIOS seemed to think would be dangerous (everything under this value is in a normal grey font, everything above this value is purple). I did not attempt to change the CAS value yet, I thought I shouldn't make too many changes at once or I'd confuse myself. The problem seems to have gone away, but it took two weeks to appear in the first place so I'm not sure. 

what gave/gives? can I safely leave my voltage at 1.65v? should I set my CAS down to 8?

right now i'm just trying to achieve system stability at my rated memory speed, NOT overclocking performance. I've never messed with memory speeds or timings before so any advice in any amount of detail would be appreciated. I'll probably crosspost this to buildapc because they helped me with the rig in the first place.

I am new to overclocking and the highest stable OC I can get with just changing the multiplier is 3.7Ghz with everything on auto.

- My cpu voltage can only be stepped in .025V increments in my bios, but the cpu voltage in bios is never right on these marks

* Any setting applied in the Catalyst Overdrive^TM settings is per GPU meaning you have to click the drop down menu and apply the settings to the second display adapter.
* In the Catalyst Overdrive^TM settings push the Power control settings to +20% this allow the card to give the GPUs extra wattage and raise the thermal limit 

I run a waterblock on my GPU so most of the thermal issues are nonexistent as it idles at ~110F and ~140F loaded. Also flipping the switch will increas the power draw from 375w to 450w so you better have a big +12VDC rail

I have the multi at 9.0 and the Bus at 378, when I set the Bus to 400 to acheive that clock it has troubles POSTing. To achieve the 3.4 I'm currently at I had to unlink the RAM from dual channel to single channel.

The temps are very stable and the RAM is good too (considering), I'm pretty sure I could get that magic 50% but at what cost?

I'm not really happy with the cooler. I feel like the X60 would probably give me more headroom.

UPDATE: I've decided to go with the X60 over my current Silverstone HE01 and the other prospect Cooler Master Eisberg. 

I liked the all copper components of the Eisberg, but the X60 has larger surface area and is almost $80 cheaper with newegg's sale. The expandability of the Eisberg is nice, but it will be most likely be 2 or 3 years away before I really move to a complete water cool if at all.

I will run some benches before I remove my HE01 and compare with the X60.

So last weekend, I put my PC together and decided to give overclocking a try. Being fairly new at OC'ing I decided to read around in which I found [that Linus video](http://youtu.be/0CHs5_TdpXE) and followed along with that. The steps outlined in that video appear to be:


1) set to 'sync on all cores'

2) set the multiplier

3) set the voltage

4) test

5) if tests fail, go back to 2 and modify inputs, otherwise continue

6) set voltage control to 'adaptive'

7) enjoy



The tests I ran were an hour of AIDA64 stability test followed by 5 runs of 3DMARK11 (which I am beginning to notice is wrong).


Anyway, after doing the initial test of 4.6ghz on 1.2v, I was disappointed to discover that my CPU was not one of the lucky ones. I could not get the PC to boot at anything above 4.2ghz and that was with 1.23v. After running the stability tests, the temps never went above 80c. So I decided that it seemed stable enough and proceeded to set the voltage control to adaptive (with a maximum of 1.23v) and go on my way.


Everything was fine, I spent all of yesterday playing games with zero issues, it wasn't until I was about to go to bed, I was surfing the internet when I got hit with a BSOD, leaving me to believe that my 'stable' overclock isn't so stable afterall.


Is there something I can do to stabilise my OC? I don't mind sitting at 4ghz, but 4.2 would've been much better and I just don't want to believe that after nearly 24 hours of use of CPU heavy programs and games, that a simple google search would kill it.


I understand that my stability tests can be a little more thorough, I need to run them for much longer than an hour in order to get an indication of what I need.


Is there a comprehensive guide for overclocking haswell? The video seemed to fudge over a lot of details and just seemed to be for a quick and dirty OC with a really lucky CPU. The one I have I understand is crap but I wanna get the most out of it.


Also, I don't want to be running my CPU at 1.23v constantly, especially when idling, which is why I chose adaptive. However I get the impression that people are torn between the option. Some are for it, some are against. I would like to hear the opinions of both sides so I have a better understanding.

First submission here and I am hoping to get some help in regards to overclocking my CPU and the benefit it may or may not have on my system.

My computer is primarily a gaming machine and the specs are as follows:

2x GTX780 in sli
i7 980x
6GB DDR3 RAM
ASUS P6TD Deluxe Motherboard
Antec 850W PSU

The 780's are new as of this week and the rest of the system is a couple of years older. When I purchased the 980x I was told it was one of the best CPU's on the market at the time and I also invested in a Noctua (DH-12?) cooler for it.

Now that I have two high end graphics cards I was wondering about overclocking the CPU and if it might be bottlenecking the cards as it is slightly older. Currently CPU-Z tells me it is running at 3.33ghz.

Is it worth overclocking my CPU purely from a gaming standpoint and what benefit would it even have?

I watched a video today on overclocking where the person in question started ended up having his CPU running at a lower voltage but faster clock speeds. Does this mean I could just go into my BIOS and leave my voltage as is but just choose to have the processor run at 4.0ghz? 

Sorry if these questions are the equivalent of adding two and two together for a small child but I'm a complete newbie when it comes to this stuff and I just want to find out if there is a benefit to overclocking CPU from a gaming perspective and how to go about it.

Turns out, I did in fact, fry my cpu. So shit, my cpu is fried, what do I do? Well, I called a good family friend that is in the computer industry, he is a software developer working for himself, and he put me in contact with a good friend of his that sells computer hardware. So he gave me his number and told me to call saying that he sent me.

So I did. David answered and I told him what happened, and he said he would call me back in 5 minutes. And he did. He called me back, with another guy on the line, that's business was located roughly 30 minutes from my house. He told me that he was willing to sell me an Intel i7-3770k 3.5ghz cpu for $250. Look it up online, lowest i could find was $320.

So I said yeah ill buy it, when can i get it? He asked if i could come right now, and I said i'd leave immediately.

Turns out, this guy that David put me in contact with builds servers for major companies, he didn't go into details, but basically he builds super high end servers and overclocks them to 4.9ghz. Well, not all cpus can run that fast, he said they have a 50% fail rate for their test. So basically he has all these working cpus that just didnt meet the requirements that he needs, and just resells them to try and make back what he lost from buying them.

1374092163.0,4,self.overclocking,1iicq6,Pushing your GTX 680/780 Classified further w/o EVBot,9,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/1iicq6/pushing_your_gtx_680780_classified_further_wo/,"**NOTE BEFORE CONTINUING: Pushing your GPU/CPU past voltage defaults can harm your hardware. I take no responsibility for damage done. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! Always watch temperatures and look for artifacting.**

Heya guys! So, I've been looking to squeeze some more juice out of my GTX 680 Classifieds (x2) and I found that while modifying my BIOS allowed me to push them to 1.212v, it wasn't that much of an increase in performance, but it was still a tad bit noticeable. The real limiting factor on the Classifieds, mainly the 680, is it starves for memory Mhz.


**Changes:**

After not procuring the EVGA forums for awhile, I came across k|ngp|n's software OC tool, which allows you to push the card to a GPU-breaking 1.35v, **which I would not recommend overvolting to on air/stock cooler.**

k|ngp|n's post can be found here (with voltmeter readings): [http://kingpincooling.com/forum/showthread.php?t=2347](http://kingpincooling.com/forum/showthread.php?t=2347)

Please not this program only works (officially) with GTX 680 and 780 Classified cards. You can download the program here:

[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B470YcZoNX_zSjJiXy1xUkRmWFE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B470YcZoNX_zSjJiXy1xUkRmWFE/edit?usp=sharing)

Picture of the program: [http://puu.sh/3FgT3.png](http://puu.sh/3FgT3.png)

It's virus free and all that jazz. Here's an explanation of the slider bars:

Explanation: [http://puu.sh/3Fh57.png](http://puu.sh/3Fh57.png)

It's important to note that 1.3v, on the 680 Classified, is the Max Safe Voltage (MSV) according to EVGA's website. This is why I've limited it to this voltage, but others that may not want to run this can lower it to 1.275v or lower and be relatively safer.

**NOTE: Your voltage will not change to the voltage you set it to in EVGA Precision X, as it has a default of 1.175v (unmodded BIOS) and 1.212v (modded BIOS). Rest assured that your GPU is at the voltage you set it to in the program, however.**

Example: [http://puu.sh/3FhCr.jpg](http://puu.sh/3FhCr.jpg)

The default voltage of the memory is set @ 1.6v, going up to a max of 1.8v. As memory clock on 4GB VRAM is a huge limiting factor, ranging from anywhere from 100-500 point difference in Unigine Valley, I've set this to a max of 1.8v.

**NOTE: When changing the FBVDD, your screen will flash and/or your computer may restart itself. Don't freak out, as is this intended, and the FBVDD did apply.**

I have did not edit my PEXVDD voltages, for the simple reason that when changing these voltages on my cards, they became highly unstable, causing the Nvidia Driver to crash multiple times. So, I've opted to reset them and leave them at their default values.


**Testing:**

I used Unigine's Valley benchmark for testing purposes. The reason behind this is because, imo, Valley gives you the most ""real world"" test for stability, as I've always been able to hit higher OC's in 3D Mark, yet that same OC being unstable in real world games/applications.

If you're unfamiliar with stability testing, you generally want to first set your power target to the max %. This makes sure that your GPU power target isn't overreached, forcing your GPU to downclock itself. Note that this will raise your GPU power by a bit at idle.

Next, you want to change your GPU Clock, generally increasing it. You can start with any value you think is reasonable for your voltage that you set earlier. Run the bench. If it completes, then you're stable, and may choose to further increase this clock and test again. If it crashes at any point, you need to lower your GPU offset. This will take some time.

**Watch your temperatures!**

@NVVDD 1.3v: For me, it was +179Mhz, giving me a total of 1355Mhz. (Results will vary.)

Once you have your GPU clock stable, next you want to increase your Memory Clock. Memory clock on anything larger than 2GB VRAM will be testy. So, results per card vary greatly. Perform the same treatment on your Memory clock as you did on your GPU clock, testing for stability.

@FBVDD 1.8v: For me, it was +745Mhz, giving me a total of 3750Mhz. (Results will vary.)


So, for the Valley test, we have:

GPU @ 1355Mhz clock
Memory @ 3750Mhz clock

Also:

CPU @ 5.0Ghz @ 1.422v on H2O.


**Results:**

Valley ended up scoring a very respectable 4036.

Max Temperature: [http://puu.sh/3Fiow.png](http://puu.sh/3Fiow.png)

You can see the clocks in the top right when zooming in. You may need to play with your stability a bit before actually settling on something your happy with. It can take a month or so before you find an OC your happy with. Just don't rush it and take your time in stability testing.

Aside: I also ran a 3D Mark Firestrike at the same settings, for anyone interested.

Anyway, I've got an AMD A10-6800k (went with it because it's cheap and has the best IGP on the market and I didn't really want to spend extra money on a discrete GPU) inside a Biostar A85W motherboard. The CPU comes stock at 4.1 GHz and I've been messing around with overclocking it but I've run into the weirdest issue.

I can increase voltage to exactly 1.362v with no issues, though oddly even with no LLC or anything CPU-z reports the actual voltage at around 1.38 while not under load and increases to 1.392 while under load.

The weird thing is, the moment I increase the voltage, whether in BIOS or via AMD's Overdrive utility, to anything over 1.362v, the CPU immediately downclocks itself on all cores even when under zero load.

If I'm at 1.362v or less, all 4 cores remain at 4.7 GHz, if I bump it up even one notch above that under zero load, all cores drop to 3.8 GHz. It's making overclocking any further impossible (though the IGP in this thing can overclock like crazy, I've been over 1100 MHz up from 833 with no difficulties), as no matter what I do or how much thermal headroom I have, the CPU just automatically downclocks over 1.362v.

I'm really confused, as lots of people are able to get over 5 GHz on air with this chip, and I don't know if the MoBo is to blame or the CPU. It just seems so strange that even while at 0% CPU utilization, a single uptick in voltage results in instant downclocking of all cores.

I'm looking to buy a new CPU and mobo once I get back to England in autumn but I'm struggling to decide between two mobos, MSI 990XA-GD55 or Gigabyte GA-970A-UD3. The CPU I'll get is most likely going to be the FX 6300 but I'm hoping that the mobo I choose will also do well for an upgrade to Steamroller, probably the top CPU of that line-up. Obviously, no one can talk about what's not out yet but I've heard that those mobos aren't capable of overclocking the FX 8350 too much either, so I'm in need of a bit of reassurance. I'm not looking for a crazy OC and I know you still need a bit of luck with what CPU you'll get but, at least for the 6300, I'm looking for a 20% overclock, i.e. get the 6300 to 4.2ghz at least. I believe that's more than doable for the 6300 but I'm curious to know what I can expect of the mobos for, say, 8350 and beyond.

Secondly, I'm trying to find some reviews of the FX 6300 with benchmarks before and after overclocking so I know how much of a practical difference the overclock will make. If you know any (even done yourselves) I'd appreciate them.

I built a mini PC a while back and I was curious to see if I could overclock it a bit. The main reason I went small was for transportability, I originally thought I was going overseas and that a miniature PC would be much less of a hassle to bring abroad. Performance wise it runs pretty well, but I noticed for example in the new Tomb Raider game there are scenes with the TRESSFX where it doesn't run smoothly. By turning the both shadow options down to normal, reducing some options like depth of field to normal, and leaving everything else as ultra, I manage to get about 35-40 FPS on average. I really like the TRESSFX looks with the hair, but any scene where it zooms close on Lara the FPS drops down to about 12. I was hoping overclocking the PC could help get these up close scenes up to 35 and average gameplay to at minimum 50 FPS.

My main issue is that I only have a stock cooler on the CPU, but with the small case it may be a challenge to find a better cooler that can fit. To give you an idea of what I'm working with, here are the main components of my PC.

* Case &amp; Power Supply - SilverStone Mini-ITX/Mini-DTX Case with 600W 80+ Bronze Certified Power Supply SG07B (Black)
* CPU - Intel Core i5-3570K Quad-Core Processor 3.4 GHz 4 Core LGA 1155
* MOBO - ASRock Z77E-ITX LGA 1155 Intel Z77 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 Mini ITX Intel Motherboard
* Video Card - MSI R7850 Twin Frozr OC AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB GDDR5 DVI/HDMI/2xMiniDisplayPort PCI-Express Video Card R7850 TWIN FROZR 2GD5/OC
* RAM - Corsair Vengeance Low Profile 8 GB (2x4GB) PC3-12800 1600mhz 240-Pin DDR3 Dual Channel

With ASRock Extreme Tuning Utility, I think I'm currently running at about 4.2 GHz, with the CPU Ratio at 42 and the BCLK/PCIE Frequency at 101.50. I haven't made any changes to the voltage settings. According to the utility, the CPU only gets up to about 55 C while running Tomb Raider or BF3, so I think I could pump a bit more into it. I keep the entire thing lifted in order for the fan located under the power supply to get good air flow. There is also the 1 fan in the back on top of the case above the MOBO and CPU, as well as the two mini fans on the VC blowing out the side vents.

So my first question is will overclocking the extra 200 - 400 MHz make much of a difference in performance? And if so, then is it safe to OC with my current set up or do I need to buy a better cooler? Last question would be...exactly how do OC the thing properly then. I feel the Tuning utility isn't exactly the best route.",,False,self,t5_2rfc8,False,,,True,t3_1h6y3q,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/1h6y3q/is_my_build_safe_to_oc/,

First I will buy a new GPU, I am planning to go for the new GTX 780. And instead of buying a new processor, I'll clock the one I already got. But then there is a problem, I don't know shit about overclocking.. 
After a little reading on the forums and on reddit, I found this post by user *tito13kfm*

&gt; There are 2 ways to overclock the 2500k. The generally accepted best way to do it is by increasing the multiplier of the Turbo. You can lock it so that under load all 4 cores will be overclocked to the same setting. A common overclock is 45x turbo, which means that all 4 cores will be running at 4.5GHz under full load, 3.3GHz under moderate load, and 1.6GHz at idle. The other way to overclock would be to completely disable Turbo. This also generally means you will be disabling Cool n Quiet (or whatever microsoft calls it.) The reason this way is not generally recommended is because your computer would never clock down at idle. You'd always be running at 4.5GHz. This also means the the voltage must also remain high at all times to prevent random crashes. Avoid this method.

So I'm just wondering how I can clock the processor the way *tito* described, so the Turbo Boost feature can downclock to 2 different levels when not under full load.

I originally built my computer at the end of last summer and I bought a Antec Khuler h20 920 in preperation for overclocking but never got around to it. I am looking for any advice I can get.

**My settings:**

 * CPU Ratio- 20.00
 * CPU Bus Freq- 230
 * Mem. Freq- 1840
 * CPU Voltage-1.4
 * DDR3 Volt- 1.55
 
With these settings I am at a stable 4.6Ghz. I feel like I can go higher so I will play with it more. As for temps at 4.6Ghz I noticed an up in idle temps from ~20°C to ~25°C. General use seems to be more responsive. As for gaming I have yet to find out and will post back.

The LLC is set to 100 and the power target is set to 20, full. Adjusting the voltage buttons on the card it self is the only thing making me able to reach 1300 mV at all when gaming.

I also had a pretty usual issue where the Mobo didn't recognize my card at first. Had to trial and error for two days before I somehow got it working.

Does anyone know how to fix these issues or what to do to test what part there's something wrong with? Are there any other voltage indicators I should use? I'm really not sure if I can trust GPUTweak or not.

Is ASUS serious here? How could they possibly fuck up that much on a high end card for over $500?!

I guess my next card will be a MSI Lightning or Sapphire. No way I'm going back to ASUS.

I have a i5 3570k at 4.3ghz right now, then only thing that seems different is the idle temps are maybe 5C higher, but that might just because I turned off speed step and the C1E in the bios. Should I turn speedstep back on? So my cpu is always at 4.3ghz in cpu-z.  

So under load on prime95 it's reading 4.3ghz at 1.12V being the highest it gets to. Max tdp is 77W and core temp tops out around 80C for all cores. Ok so it might be a little hotter than stock speed but not by much. 

So one thing is when I OC'd my gtx 670 nothing happened with the performance until i boosted the power limit % to 111%. So should I boost the power the cpu is allowed to use somehow?
also another thing.... my fsb ratio for the ram is 1:5. I heard that doesn't matter anymore though. But I never seem to fully utilize all my ram. i almost never go above 5gb used with 3gb free. Is there something wrong?

I have two questions:  
  
First, is my voltage too high? Because of the LLC it fluctuates from 1.392-1.416. I'm only looking at keeping this chip for probably 3 years at most. A previous stable OC was at 4.8Ghz at 1.375V with PLL disabled and every other setting the same. Max Temps then was 66C.
Or any tips to drop the voltage down a bit?

Second, what is a better test to ensure stability? ""Blend"" mode but with using all my available memory for 12hrs?  
  
Any comment is appreciated.

I've just purchased my first PC after having been out of the PC game for a few years (5)

I'm getting back to my roots in a big way and although I've never overclocked before, I ordered some gear that'll let me do it.

I got a 3930k(3.2), an ASUS Rampage IV Formula and a Corsair H100i.

I've been watching some youtube videos but to be honest I'm still kind of confused. My goal is to start with a conservative(?) overclock of 4.2 and see where it goes.

As far as I can tell, the basic steps are setting ""CPU Ratio"" to ""42"" and upping the voltage to something like 1.325v...then go from there and check the temps.

Now, I think I understand what the CPU Ratio does, but I don't really get the voltage...

I'm looking for a guide, even a huge wall of text on a forum somewhere, that could help me get started in understanding a bit more.

1356916245.0,4,self.overclocking,15p6i9,Suggestion: Open loop liquid cooling and G12 automobile coolant,7,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/15p6i9/suggestion_open_loop_liquid_cooling_and_g12/,"I just wanted to suggest to everyone based off my experience with liquid cooling that I am super impressed/happy with using G12 coolant in my computer.

This coolant is used in my VW Golf; it costs $30 CAD for a 4 Litre jug of concentrated coolant. I mixed it 50/50 with distilled water, which is how my car takes it and how I put it in my computer. I could only seem to get this from my VW dealership (I bet other vehicle dealers selling cars that use this coolant will have it in stock too).

It is sold to the PC liquid community as ""Water Wetter"", however Water Wetter is usually sold at about $15 for a small 250ml bottles, which it is suggest to mix 50/50 to 30/70 (coolant to water).

This stuff has a pinkish color to it, but will glow orange under UV light. It is considered non-conductive (and I had some catastrophic leaks to prove that it is non-conductive) and non corrosive (is corrosive the right word? apparently you can mix metals without a problem, and I use nickle plated blocks and pure copper blocks in the same loop).

The big pluses of this stuff (besides price vs volume and being able to get it locally) is that you shouldn't need to change the coolant that often. I was lazy over the past year and finally got off my ass to change the coolant after over a year of use (my temps never rose so I only ever topped it up a bit). The coolant I drained from my system looks just as clean as the new stuff. I took apart my blocks to clean them and there was only minor traces of gunk/buildup, most likely left behind from inside the radiators from the old coolant I used). 

This is much better than the green swiftech stuff I use to use. That stuff would go from green to a deep black color, and the gunk build up was so bad I would change the tubing in my system after a year (which was usually 3 coolant changes when I would change every 4 years).

Now I would go on a limb and say that this stuff mixed at 50/50 I would never need to be changed until you needed to change your loop. I would totally reuse the stuff I drained out of my system again if it wasn't for the fact that I still have 2 litres of mixed coolant (4L of concentrate mixed 50/50 to make 8L of mixed coolant; ~5 litres went into my car, and ~1 litre went into my loop). I will actually just put this coolant form my PC coolant to top off my car (since they both are using this g12 coolant).

Just like antifreeze for your car, and PC Liquid cooling coolant, don't mix this with other coolants and make sure you flush your current system thoroughly before switching to this.

And yes, mixed at 50/50 this stuff does seem to run 2-3 degrees warmer than the swiftech stuff I used (mixed at 25/75 coolant-water), however when the swiftech stuff turned black after a couple of months it would rise between 5-10 degrees. I totally think the trade of 2-3 degrees is worth not needing to change the coolant, change your tubing, or needing to scrub your blocks as often.

I have not mixed this with dyes; dyes tend to cause bad gunk build up and I couldn;t find any reliable sources that said I could mix G12 with dyes.",,False,self,t5_2rfc8,False,,amd,True,t3_15p6i9,http://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/15p6i9/suggestion_open_loop_liquid_cooling_and_g12/,
