So we already know what has officially been announced for launch/launch window so far, but what about after that? What are the  studios up to? Yoshida was asked before if it was fair to say that all studios are working on projects for the PS4, and he replied ""[Is it fair or not fair? It is fair to say.](http://gematsu.com/2013/02/sony-all-first-party-studios-working-on-playstation-4-games)""

I'll be listing studios and what they could possibly be working on, but if they've already announced a next-gen game and don't have multiple teams then they won't be on this list (ie. Sucker Punch, Evolution Studios). SCE Japan for example has a large staff and multiple teams and sister studios, so they will be listed even though they're working on Knack. 

Reminder,*these are exclusives.* They're first party studios, but in the odd chance they're working on something multi-platform I've chosen to ignore it. Vita game studios such as Guerrilla Cambridge will not be listed either, as well as co-developing (meaning they mostly help out other teams) studios such as SCE Foster City. 

If I miss anything, just point it out.

*It seems people are coming with more information especially from second party/devoted indie studios so I might add them to the list as well, just need to find more information on it!*

**SCE Japan (Team ICO, Project Siren)** 

* Last Guardian (Kotaku interview with Shuhei Yoshida claims [""it's still in active development, we are not ready to reintroduce it yet. Please wait.""](http://kotaku.com/sony-corrects-themselves-says-the-last-guardian-is-not-512720979).)
* Gravity Rush 2 (most likely a Vita-exclusive but there is slight possibility it could come to the PS4, unlikely but possible)
* Siren/new (or old) IP 

**Polyphony Digital**

* Gran Turismo 7 (or possibly even a re-release 6 that comes with DLC or is at a lower price. Seems like /u/predanator linked some information that suggests GT6 will ""[appear naturally](http://gematsu.com/2013/06/ps4-gran-turismo-6-naturally-appear)"" on the PS4.)

**Naughty Dog**

* Totally new IP (following their pattern from previous generations, they don't seem to stick with an IP for very long after launch of a generation. Here's an image of some concept that was found, no one knows if this is for Uncharted 4, a new IP, etc. [Here](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/05/tloujpg-acb7c9_800w-610x381.jpg).) 
* Last of Us 2 (Thanks to /u/Finch313 for pointing out they now have 2 teams, and [Sony has registered some Last of Us domains](http://www.vg247.com/2013/05/16/sony-files-numerical-domain-registrations-for-the-last-of-us-the-order-1886-speculation-resumes/), which could mean multiple things. Start guessing!)
* Jak 4 (Rumored [Never say never,"" he said. ""It could happen. Naughty Dog's got a long history and I think it's got a long future so to say we'll never go back is kind of crazy but right now we've got [The Last of Us] that we're definitely going to be supporting. I guess there's a possibility that the Uncharted team could move on to Jak and Daxter.""](http://ca.ign.com/articles/2012/02/06/the-last-of-us-replaced-jak-and-daxter-4).)

**SCE San Diego**

* MLB 14: The Show 
* New IP 

**SCE Santa Monica** (pretty busy already with Order 1886 and Hohokum although those two titles are being co-developed)

* Playstation All Stars Battle Royale (how can it NOT come to PS4, probably under a new name)
* God of War (Ascension seems to indicate the want to make the series more of a multi-player game, so the next GoW could be a F2P Multiplayer game)
* New IP. (Courtesy of /u/Lemondish - Some of the job ads pointed at an open world third or first person action game with guns, magic, and vehicular combat. Stigg Asmussen (of GoW 3 fame) is supposedly heading this team. [Here are some job posting that links to needing people with experience in *open-world, vehicles, and shooters*](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=428619). Here is another post definitely pointing to something NOT [god of war at all so that's interesting](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2012/04/19/game-director-stig-asmussen-doing-cool-stuff-at-sony-santa-monica-not-god-of-war-ascension/).) 

**Guerrilla Games**

* New IP (The wiki links to an IGN article that talks about how they're working on a killzone sequel for PS4 (shadowfall) and ""[talked about a new IP](http://ca.ign.com/articles/2011/11/18/killzone-follow-up-in-the-works)"". Could be a misunderstanding though.)

**SCE London**

* Singstar, or a new IP that relies on accessories. 

**Media Molecule**

* Littlebigplanet 3 (although reports are swirling that it's being co-developed with Sumo Digital, so that could leave for potential for a new IP.)
* New IP

**Quantic Dream** (Second Party Studio)

* New IP (As /u/IceBreak pointed out, it's probably [Singularity](http://www.t3.com/news/quantic-dream-registers-singularity-for-ps4).)

**SCE Bend**

* New IP

**Housemarque** (Second Party Studio)

* Super Stardust Successor
* New (or possibly old) IP (Courtesy /u/IceBreak. Here's some [more information](http://www.nowgamer.com/news/1937330/housemarque_developing_two_ps4_exclusives.html).)

**Zindagi Games** (Second Party Studio)

* New Motion game with Online Multiplayer (Credits to /u/Dinjooh, here's some [information on it](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2013/06/14/zindagi-games-2013-ps4-motion-game-to-have-online-multiplayer-job-suggests/). It could possibly be Sports Champion 3 or something similar to the Wii Fit/Sports/etc. games.)


*No clear idea why I made the list but I thought it would be helpful to those of you who are wondering what your favorite first-party studio is up to, or even what could possibly be announced in the coming months.* 


---

***Refresher*** (Studios that have announced PS4 titles, and are working on them. If you see them below and above, it means they have large/multiple teams that are possibly working on multiple titles at once.)

**Sucker Punch**

* Infamous Second Son

**Evolution Studios**

* DriveClub

**SCE Japan** 

* Knack

**Guerrilla Games** 

* Killzone: Shadow Fall

**SCE Santa Monica**

* The Order: 1886
* Hohokum

---

**As /u/PTG_ has pointed out, the above list is only scratching the surface. The worldwide studios seem to have a lot more up their sleeves;** 
&gt; from SCE Worldwide Studios, *more than 30 titles, including 12 brand new IP*, are under development, including Killzone: Shadow Fall, Knack, inFAMOUS: Second Son, #DRIVECLUB and The Order: 1886.

###**Official Features**

***

* The PS4 allows people to resume games instantly upon turning on the system (no startup time) from where they were when they turned the system off. ([Source](http://www.psu.com/a018423/PS4s-Suspend-Mode-detailed-pick-up-games-right-where-you-left-off))

* All PS4 games (that aren't camera-based) should be playable remotely on Day 1 via Remote Play on the PS Vita. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/18ys2w/sony_exec_ps4vita_remote_play_will_work_day_one/))

* The PS4 will allow users to play games after downloading only a small portion of the game's data. ([Source](http://www.joystiq.com/2013/02/20/ps4-allows-playing-games-as-theyre-downloading/))

* Gamers can charge the DualShock 4 controller while PS4 is on standby. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/197exn/you_can_charge_the_dualshock_4_controller_while/))

* Share button functionality allows for quick screenshots or video upload of gameplay as well as sharing live streams of gameplay with friends or over USTREAM. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/19326z/people_seem_confused_about_how_the_share_button/))

* Users will be able take remote control of friends' games to help them through tough spots and such.  ([Source](http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/20/playstation-4-game-streaming/))

* The system will launch with a headset that plugs directly into the controller for more prevalent voice communication across the PSN. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/18yddw/new_ps4_console_will_come_with_bundle_including_a/))

* Cross-game chat is officially supported. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/196eq4/crossgame_chat_officially_confirmed/))

* The PS4 will **not** block used games.  Though publishers are free to do as they wish. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/190uv8/sony_blocking_used_games_on_the_ps4_is_a/))

* Game prices will range from $0.99-$59.99. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/191515/ps4_titles_will_be_99_cents_to_60/))

* All PS4 games will be available as digital downloads. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/191dec/all_ps4_games_will_be_available_as_digital/))

* The PS4 will support Move but not the DualShock 3. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/192wc9/the_ps4_supports_move_but_not_ps3_controllers/))

* A PlayStation app called 'PlayStation App' is coming to Android and iOS that allows the device to act as a second screen (a la SmartGlass) as well as purchase content and have it directly downloaded to your system. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/18ycb1/sonys_playstation_app_for_ios_and_android_adds/))  It stands to reason that this will also include messaging on the go and other stuff like that.

* The PS4 will support 4K video output but not for games. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/18yvmy/playstation_4_wont_support_4k_games_3d_not_a_focus/))

* The PS4 is 3D capable but it is not a focus. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/18yvmy/playstation_4_wont_support_4k_games_3d_not_a_focus/))

* Certain apps can run in the background of games (such as the web browser) so you can access them without having to leave the game itself.  ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/196k7x/the_ps4_allows_for_background_apps_much_like_the/))

**Unsupported**

* **The PS4 is not natively backwards compatible** and thus cannot play PS3 games by default.  However, to remedy this Sony has invested heavily in cloud gaming and hopes to have a cloud-based solution to allow for PS3 games on the PS4 as well as other devices. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/18z56v/ps4_is_not_backwards_compatible_even_with_digital/))

* The PS4 will not support the DualShock 3. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/192wc9/the_ps4_supports_move_but_not_ps3_controllers/))

**Missing Stuff So Far**

* The System Itself - No biggie.  My guess it will be a black box with stuff in it.

* System Pricing - including if there will be tiered models or a PS Vita bundle.

* Hard Drive Size/Upgradability - What size HDDs will launch with the system and will they be easily upgradable like the PS3?

* Pressure Sensitive Buttons - Are the controller buttons still pressure sensitive like the DualShock 3's were?

* YouTube &amp; Twitter - They were both strangely missing for the apps page in the OS preview and USTREAM seems to be the official gameplay stream site of choice for Sony.  This could mean Xbox is about to announce something big in conjunction with YouTube.  ([Source](http://www.ign.com/videos/2013/02/22/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-ps4-this-week))  Still, USTREAM does support easy uploading of videos to YouTube ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/193e70/can_stuff_from_ustream_be_put_onto_youtube/)) so, as long as there is an easy way to watch YouTube, this shouldn't be a big deal.

Over on GAF, there was a thread discussing this quote. Not too long after a proven insider has said that Sony has held off on the idea due to the XBONE backlash. He also says that Sony listens via twitter. One thing lead to another and people there have been tweeting at various PlayStation execs in a VERY RESPECTABLE MANNER their disdain for Online DRM and whatnot.

Tweet from @Shahidkamal tweeted at 6:27am on Mon, May 27, 2013: I know my colleagues might not appreciate me saying this, but I've rather enjoyed being Twitter bombed by passionate fans recently.

#PSA: DRM Explanation

Digital Rights Management. In this case, its not allowing you to play a game unless the hardware you're using is connected to the web to verify you're the person who made the initial purchase.
This strips the consumer of all rights and turns the game into a service rather than a product. If that company no longer exists, or they decide that it is no longer financially conducive for them to keep the server allocated to verify the games ownership running, then said game will no longer work. Other issues have befallen DRM. Look up the history of Ubisoft DRM, Diablo 3 DRM, and Simcity DRM for other examples.

That is true, because, well, I like plasmas. However, I realize that this is also unfair of me, so I made an addition better describing the benefits of LED such as their typically superior response times and ease of setup.**

**EDIT: I am slowly, but surely, trying to reply to as many questions as possible. I work full-time and also have full-time hobbies that get in the way. Thank you again for the interest.**

***Thanks so much for the interest. I tried to do some quick replies, but I haven't been able to get to everyone or make necessary clarifications. I need to head out to work now, but I'll get back to this as soon as I can.***

***Edited for clarity, grammar, and pending sources.*** *EDIT: Sources found regarding Samsung's pixel matrix.*

Been noticing far too many ""What TV should I buy for the PS4"" threads with a ridiculous amount of misleading, vague, or outright false information given to the OP. I hope to put an end to much of the confusion. I really don't want to or have the time to do this, but my frustration with the poor advice being slung around trumps my desire to ignore the problem.

Following the TL; DR is obviously a more in-depth explanation for my reasoning. Please, read on before asking a question I might have already answered.


**TL;DR**

**1.) Plasmas are best for gaming, in my opinion, but don't go less than 1080p 50"", only buy Panasonic, and keep it in a cool, dark environment. Burn-in isn't an issue anymore. ~~Samsung cheats their plasma resolutions to make cheaper TVs. Avoid those.~~ &lt;-- Pending source.** *EDIT: Interesting source found.*

*EDIT: I will leave that portion crossed out, since it might still be misleading, but I discovered that several Samsung plasmas use what's called a PenTile display. ""An early controversy regarding the definition or measurement of resolution of color subpixelated flat panel displays in general, and for subpixel rendered displays in particular, led many people to question the resolution claims of PenTile display products.""*

*-[From Wikipedia on PenTile matrix displays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PenTile_matrix_family)*

One can tell with the naked eye that they are absolutely using a PenTile matrix, which looks like [this](http://www.avforums.com/forums/attachments/plasma-tvs/393004d1367063705-samsung-ps60f5500-plasma-thread-p1000827.jpg). Granted, that's an extreme close-up, but you can tell something wonky is going on with the picture, and appears to have blank pixels, or portions of the screen which appear completely unused as there are observable gaps in the pixels that never change from black. I'm not a fan of this, and find it very off-putting, as it plainly looks as if the T.V. is missing pixels.

**2.) If you can't go bigger than a 32"", a 60hz LED is absolutely fine! You'll want to sit close, though.**

**3.) 120hz 32"" are mostly bullshit. Avoid them. They are a waste of money.**

**4.) If you're going above 32"", don't get anything below 1080p and if you must buy a higher refresh rate, turn the motion settings off, otherwise these TVs will cause input lag and ruin your gaming experience.**

**5.) Overall, stick with these brands: Panasonic and Samsung are the technically the best rated and Sony, LG, and Sharp being very close 2nd places.**

**6.) Passable cheap TVs are Toshibas, Vizios, and Insignias (at the bottom). Be careful with refresh rates with these brands, they tend to fabricate their numbers.**

**7.) If I haven't listed a brand, it's because they're awful. Avoid them.**

**8.) From user Harkster, a [fantastic list of TVs with Excellent to Bad input lag](http://www.displaylag.com/display-database/)** 

**9.) On ANY TV, be sure to be using ""User"" or ""Custom"" settings and make certain to turn off all unnecessary picture options such as black level extenders, dynamic contrast enhancers, noise filtering, and the like as they might look flashy and pretty at first, but not only do they cause huge input lag, they literally erase important details from your image!**

Why should you listen to me? Yes, I am a TV salesman. Yes, I am very good at it and my customers love me for my ""honesty"" and complete lack of a ""pushy attitude,"" as quoted from my customer's own words. My interest in televisions and their tech goes back more than 10 years of not only buying several myself, selling to my friends, family, and consumers, plus tons of internet research and boat loads of forum discussions with professionals as well as IRL professionals, and few years of hands-on installations both big and small.

And yes, Monster HDMI cables are absolute bullshit and I don't sell them unless you ask me for them. I take pride in my plainness and non-bullshit approach to sales. Contrary to popular retail practice, this works frequently in my own favor as well as my employers. So, on with it, then...

**Refresh Rates!**

First of all, the mother of all misleading information is regarding 60hz, 120hz, 240hz, (and 600hz which is completely different, but I'll get back to that) etc. Almost everyone is universally suggesting get ""atleast 120hz."" This isn't entirely a great idea. First of all, 120hz and 240hz are not native refresh rates. In fact, they're not technically refresh rates. That's a simple way of saying that there are usually motion correction settings available to the viewer. These motion settings are awful for gaming and buying a 120hz TV will do nothing but give you input lag (among other issues like haloing) and worsen your gaming experience so long as you aren't privy to the fact that you can turn these options off.

**Well, what is Input lag?** The previously mentioned motion settings are meant for predictable sources like films and TV shows. There is a steady stream coming into the TV that the hardware can parse and ""know"" what comes next. In other words, one frame comes into the TV and with the next frame on its way, the TV can decide what frame might be best to go in between these two and it creates that artificial image to place in between the two frames in order to ""smooth"" the movement.

**Why is this awful for games?** Well, it's simple. There isn't a steady predictable stream of frames coming into your TV for it to ""predict"" what will happen next quickly enough. So, you tilt the analog stick right, and what the TV does is it delays your image, gathers the first frame and the following frame registered from your tilt, creates the artificial image, then finally shows you the product of that button press at a delayed response.

Besides gaming, these motion correction settings can be pleasing to some viewers as it smooths out movement for television shows and movies. I'm one of the viewers that finds it utterly unbearable, but it's subjective, I guess. I think it looks horrendous, but we'll stick with ""subjective.""

If you feel you must get a 120hz or 240hz TV, please make certain when gaming that you turn off Motion-flow, Auto-motion plus, Motion smoothing, Cinema Smooth, de-judder, de-blur, or whatever it might be called on your particular brand of television.

**What the hell is 600hz, then?**

600hz is an entirely different thing altogether. It's not at all similar to 120 or 240. Considering technology at the time of this writing, you can only get this on plasma TVs. Think of it like a super-60hz where the TV refreshes at 60 frames per second, but every single frame is full resolution all of the time and will not have the same blurring or judder issues like 60, 120, or 240. Every frame is perfectly crisp no matter how fast the action. There's more to it than this, but we'll leave it at that.

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1687497632/h-hour-worlds-elite-0

**EDIT: EVERYTHING WE KNOW SO FAR (Copy and Pasted from ElementsofDeath)**

**Release / Important Date(s)**

* Full release January 2015, but i'm hoping they move it up to Nov 2014.
* There will be a Developers vs Kickstarter Backers tournament at some point.
* Mobile app March 2015 (tentative).
* Single player is scheduled to launch 6 months post the multiplayer release of H-Hour. It is likely to be less than 20hrs of gameplay, DLC will add to the single player.
* First H-Hour DLC will launch 3-4 months after the initial release.

**Beta Timelines**

* There will be a beta for PS4.
* July 2014 (closed beta - early kickstarter backers, etc.)

**Technical**

* 7.1 Surround sound.
* 1080p on PC and PS4 @ 60fps.
* Patching / Content will generally be simultaneous, however patches may be developed per platform to fix bugs.
* LAN play will be available. 
* There will be no map editor, however you can make your own maps, for LAN use.

**General**

* H-hour will be very akin to SOCOM I &amp; II: realistic, tactical, close quarters, but certainly fun (""arcadey"" where necessary).
* Game will ship as a multi-player experience only, at first. A campaign will follow down the road.
* H-Hour will be round based.
* H-Hour will only take 2-3 bullets to kill, keeping the game tactical and cover based.
* H-Hour will be 3rd person, with a 1st person view ala SOCOM I &amp; II (Zoom), the camera will be centered behind the back, like old SOCOMs.
* There will be similar maps to some of our old SOCOM favs, but of course will different names and likeness to limit liability (ie, being sued). 
* Vote to Kick (thank GOD!). Will address the issue of votes giving warnings to alive team-mates.
* DLC will always be free for ""maps, guns, etc."" (aka: non-exclusionary &amp; non-pay-to-win). Vanity, etc., will be paid for.

* Victory Dances of course will return, along with taunts and more...
* After action reports with detailed stats / anayltics (largely built from the server backend and may be delivered as long as a day after game complete). Basic stats will be displayed at end-of-game screen.

**Gameplay ""Feel""**

* ""Eshla grenadaaa"" is in!

* Backblast from rocket launchers is in. 
* Medleys will return (composite of most game modes)!!!
* The game will feature a ton of stats / analytics on player performance (exposure analysis, cooperation, responsiveness to orders, sportsmanship, hits, hotzones, etc), &amp; clan performance, probably akin to KZ2, with a lot more stat tracking and details.

I don't know if you guys keep up with Neogaf at all; but on [this thread](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=592546), as well as [this thread](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=592321), there are a lot of people talking about how components for the PS4 are being shipped in June, as well as getting e-mails/hearing at Gamestop (from internal e-mails) that the PS4 could launch in October - the 29th, specifically. 

If this is the case, this would be absolutely huge for Sony, and would blow my bet of ""two weeks before Black Friday"" out of the water.

#### Features NOT Supported on PS4

* **The PS4 is not natively backwards compatible.**  Thus it cannot play PS3 games by default.  However, to remedy this Sony has invested heavily in cloud gaming and hopes to have a cloud-based solution to allow for PS3 games on the PS4 as well as other devices. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/18z56v/ps4_is_not_backwards_compatible_even_with_digital/))

* The PS4 will not support the DualShock 3. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/192wc9/the_ps4_supports_move_but_not_ps3_controllers/))

* The PS4 will not support *at least some* of the PS3's fight sticks. ([Source](http://www.gametrailers.com/side-mission/54655/ps3-mad-catz-tournament-edition-fightstick-is-not-compatible-with-ps4))

* The DualShock 4 will not have pressure sensitive buttons (unlike the DualShock 2 and DualShock 3).  ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1b4o0r/the_dualshock_4_will_not_have_analog_buttons/))

* The PS4 cannot use the Vita as a second controllor option unless the developers program in that functionality manually.  ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1j38l0/ps_vita_cannot_be_used_as_a_second_controller/))

#### Missing Stuff So Far

* When will it launch?  

* Backwards Compatibility Questions (Gaikai Cloud Streaming)

 * Will one's PSN purchase history will carry over to the cloud gaming service?

 * Will we be able to insert a disc and access the cloud version of that game while the disc is in the system.

 * Will the cloud gaming service will require an additional charge (or even tiered charges) or just allow for game purchases?

* Will trophies instantly sync on PS4 like achievements do on Xbox 360?

This particular individual is very good about breaking Sony info, and has been accurate even recently (unlike CBOAT)

He wrote a post detailing why we shouldn't be up in arms, even taking his credibility into question, its still a well written post and a very plausible viewpoint.

""I told myself I wasn't going to post in this thread because people are foaming at the mouth and not thinking.... but here I am, which makes me an idiot.


First off, I know all you guys want are hard numbers and I don't have them. But I do know the philosophies in place currently. If you would like to use your brain and think critically about things... keep reading. If you want to get into a 5&gt;4.5 OMG IM CANCELLING MY PREORDER conversation - this thread won't help you, in either direction.


I was told by a couple of Devs in the lead up to E3 that the OS footprint was ""bigger than expected"" but not a single one of them complained about it. No one is in danger of running out of ram. As some people have mentioned in this thread - games like the The Last of Us are happening with 512mb of ram. Launch titles, of all things, are not going to be pushing the hardware in any sort of way... and that includes ram.

So why is the ram footprint bigger than expected? It's fairly simple - Sony is hedging their bets. They were absolutely caught with their pants down with their OS this gen. Not having the memory overhead to do things like Party Chat gave Microsoft a huge advantage when it came to online gaming, which is obviously a growing sector. So much like $399 as a target price was a reaction to $599 being a disaster... ""big OS footprint"" is a reaction to ""small OS footprint"" being a disaster.

But the thing that I'm hearing and I believe there was even a line dedicated to this in the eurogamer article is that these numbers aren't set in stone. The fact of the matter is that high end PC games use around 3gb of ram and use higher res textures (art tends to take up the largest chunks of ram) than the ps4/x1 do. The idea that launch games need 7gb of ram is absolutely ludicrous. 4gbs is fine. Anything more, at this point, is overkill. It won't be overkill forever... but it's overkill for now.

So Sony gets to sit on this chunk of ram, be in 1gb or 3gb - again, I don't know the numbers. I don't know if eurogamer is right (I do know at E3 that some thought more ram would be freed up when the final dev kits shipped... but I don't know anyone working with a final dev kit). But Sony is coming at this from a position of power. They don't need the ram currently so they get to take a wait and see approach before saying ""ok, devs, you guys get this."" The systems will launch and they will look at what people are doing with their own OS, they will see what features people are asking for, they will see if microsoft or Nintendo (or even steam) come out with some surprise feature that catches fire - and if it does they will have the memory there to be able to do it also. If it doesn't that chunk of ram gets freed up for developers.


This thread is looking at this entire thing like the endgame is the day it launches. That's day one, guys. This is a long term strategic move and, imo, a smart one. They are putting themselves in a position to be able to adapt... something they couldn't do with the ps3. I know as gamers all we want to hear is higher numbers. But find me one developer that thinks the ram available to them on either system isn't enough (and this goes for the x1 as well guys... all this 5gb hurr hurrr stuff is fanboyish nonsense that you can go through my post history and see I never took part in once).


I feel like this post is far to philosophical for this thread of LARGE NUMBER &gt; SMALL NUMBER, but hopefully this info is useful to some of you. Sony have created a nimble system and this is part of that philosophy. ""

TL:DR, Basically, the reason that Sony went to $400 this gen was a direct reaction to the $599 failure of last gen

And the Reason for the current (RUMOURED) Policy change is that Sony is holding off a portion of resources that they might not even need, but they got burned to hell last gen by not having enough dedicated for the Apps other companies put out (Xbox Live Cross chat?) and that they are keeping it low now, especially when Game Developers won't need the resources, and once finalization comes, more resources could be freed up)",,False,self,t5_2rrlp,False,,ps-blue,True,t3_1j42eu,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1j42eu/rumour_post_on_neogaf_about_the_ram_rumour_why_we/,

1. Hardware is Finalized

2. Full Production can start

Original Announcement:

A change to the subreddit layout is coming (it will be up shortly after this post).  Much of the hard work was thanks to /u/PineappleMeister.  It is still a work in progress (at least with RES nightmode) but it's close enough to launch.

There's a lot of visual tweaks but the actually important ones off the top of my head are:

* 5 updatable buttons (Greatness Awaits, PS4 Information, ...) have been added to the top of the subreddit.  We can set these to link to anything and change them with ease if we need to.
* The announcement bar can now span the page and will hide excess text based on browser width.
* The submit buttons have been renamed 'Link' and 'Text' and are opposite each other at the top of the sidebar.
* The message the mods link at the bottom of the page has be transformed into a button below the submit buttons.
* Posts now have a left border that changes when you hover.
* Two linkflair colors (green and red) have been added which mods alone have access to.  This will be used similar to /r/Games to mark certain less-than-accurate posts for the most part.
* The blog and store links are now buttons in the sidebar.

There's plenty more changes but most of that is just appearance.  Our goal was to make a more unique and useful layout without making it more difficult to view the subreddit.  

**Remember: This is a ton of changes so there will likely be some compatibility issues for some.

I'm wondering if Sony should/would pre-load it on the PS4, maybe alongside Warframe. They could slap a sticker on the box that says, ""2 Free Games Included!"" or something like that. Seems kind of like a no brainer when you're trying to add perceived value to a new game system.

Someone also mentioned just putting the game on a disc and throwing it in the box instead of installing it to the HD, which might be a better option, since it takes out the variable for it being considered ""bloatware"".

Regardless, I'm hoping there will be a pretty substantial player base for PS2 around launch, it will definitely be one of those games I'd be loading up and playing right around launch and should be a showpiece on the platform. It looks really good on the PC.

The article states that ""flexible"" memory is borrowed from the OS, and must be returned when requested - that's not actually the case.

The actual true distinction is that:

""Direct Memory"" is memory allocated under the traditional video game model, so the game controls all aspects of its allocation
""Flexible Memory"" is memory managed by the PS4 OS on the game's behalf, and allows games to use some very nice FreeBSD virtual memory functionality. However this memory is 100 per cent the game's memory, and is never used by the OS, and as it is the game's memory it should be easy for every developer to use it.
We have no comment to make on the amount of memory reserved by the system or what it is used for.

I'm already pretty much completely on-board for getting a PS4 at launch, but I feel like Microsoft's event next Tuesday will help us understand what to expect out of the coming generation. It will be interesting to see what new features they bring to the table. I'm pretty sure they won't announce a price or anything (I would speculate E3 at the earliest for price, maybe September); but seeing how Sony responds within the days following is going to be something I follow closely.

Also worth noting, ***please don't turn this thread into console flame wars and rumour-mongering***. We don't know the console's name, we don't know its launch lineup, we don't know what the presentation will be like or what it will focus on - but we will find out in less than a week. I think it's important to have some patience, and watch the presentation before flipping out over the rumours regarding the console's name or what have you.

Anyways, what are your guys' thoughts on all of this, are you going to be watching? ",,False,self,t5_2rrlp,False,,sce,True,t3_1eem0w,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1eem0w/who_else_is_excited_for_the_xbox_event/,

1372780399.0,67,self.PS4,1hi47b,Quick note on DirectX 11.2 features,87,20,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1hi47b/quick_note_on_directx_112_features/,"There were a lot of questions when Microsoft announced that [DirectX 11.2 was announced as a Windows 8.1 and Xbox One exclusive](http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/160076-directx-11-2-will-be-a-windows-8-1-and-xbox-one-exclusive-microsoft-dangles-the-upgrade-carrot). What does it mean for the PS4?

Specifically, the big feature people are talking about is [tiled resources](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/bg182880.aspx#four). This feature was implemented in software in Id's Rage and called ""megatextures."" (see more here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaTexture). It basically allows for graphic elements to have single, huge textures for static terrain that are streamed from memory as needed. It allows for really detailed horizons and skies as seen in Rage with little RAM usage. It's also part of a bigger effort to allow the graphics card to easily access main RAM for texture storage, which isn't an issue for either console since they're both unified memory architectures. This does matter for PC though.

Here's the good news: OpenGL already had an implementation of this, which the PS4 can use. It's also very likely that Sony's own programming API, LibGCM uses it. More good news is that AMD's GCN architecture (seen both in the PS4 and X1 APUs), has a native hardware implementation of this called Partially Resident Textures (PRT). So, Microsoft is simply exposing this to their developers by implementing this in DirectX. 

As a general rule, anything that's in DirectX can be added to openGL, or by Sony to libGCM. Furthermore, since they share the GCN architecture, Microsoft can't expose some super secret hardware feature that PS4 can't use. 

For those interested, the concept can be applied to geometry too and is called [Sparse Voxel Octrees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_Voxel_Octree). This was to be included in UE4 but has since been dropped from the feature set by Epic. Their general comments were that the power of hardware just wasn't there and it wasn't worth the computational cost. It's possible that Id Tech 6 could include this, however. It can be run on current gen hardware, but won't have hardware acceleration. Moreover, since this is a space saving technique (at the cost of more computation), it's unlikely to be needed early in the lifecycle of consoles with 8 GB of RAM available.

A little background, one of my first consoles I ever got was a PSOne, and I enjoyed the hell out of it playing Spyro: Riptos Rage, the Twisted Metal series, and even NASCAR 99 with my dad, among many other games.

I also then got a PS2 when it came out for launch, and to this day that was the system in which I played the most amount of different games on. GTA3 is still one of my favorite games of all time, along with Ratchet &amp; Clank, War of the Monsters, the DBZ Budokai series, and Champions: Return to Arms. (fun as hell to play online)

Then, I got an Xbox and Halo 2, which is still my favorite game today. It was the defining multiplayer experience for me. There was nothing quite like going into a rank 35+ clan match with all your buddies that you know in real life and online.

I skipped out on the PS3 because I am a die hard Halo fan, but I don't think one exclusive is enough to hold me to one console, and the numerous amount of negative aspects that come with it. (mandatory kinect, more expensive online service, price, etc) And to be perfectly honest, Halo really hasnt been the same for me since Halo 3, and it really came down to one thing: competitiveness. I wish FPS's today would go back to the ranking system in which you have a different rank for different playlists and would go up and down regarding how you did in the match. Nowadays it is simply XP progression.

Many of the games I am looking forward to playing are multi-platform and are ps4 exclusive, which is really the main reason why I am going with ps4 this time around: games. I am also looking forward to the implementation of Gaikai to play some of the titles that I missed out on for the PS3 and the old classics from PS2 and PS1.

But yesterday I was playing Duels of Planeswalers 2013 on my PS3 and I had an epic draw, I won't bore you non-Magic players with the details but it made me laugh out loud how perfect it was that my opponent's strategy failed miserably thanks to my one card.


Then today I was playing Uncharted: Golden Abyss and I caused a barrel to explode, which caused an enemy to fly across the screen and hit into his comrade, killing them both. It was hilarious and I wished I could have shown someone.


I now realise how perfect a Share button is, when these hilarious moments happen when I'm home alone, I can finally send them to a friend or maybe even share them with the world if they're good enough.

I'd like to open a discussion on what we think the scope of this app might be, what the best uses might be, and the technology that might be behind an app with such sophisticated interactions that's also cross-platform.

Here are the examples of game integration that Sony has put out so far.

* Drive Club (http://youtu.be/RiNGZMx2vhY?t=58m41s)
* Watch Dogs (http://youtu.be/kPYgXvgS6Ww?t=5m24s)
* Playroom demo (http://youtu.be/qSTJc9UqNk8?t=2m25s)

In the playroom demo they specifically say that this is one app for all games (though it's unclear whether that would be the case for cross-platform titles like Watch Dogs). They also say that the interaction is through a wifi connection between the mobile device and the PS4, which I'm guessing is just for real-time interactions with a locally running game.

It seems like it would be really hard to make this work well on both iOS and Android. My best guess is that Sony will have a limited SDK that helps developers send data back and forth to the PS4 and segment their content within the PlayStation app, and it will be up to the developers to design their interfaces from scratch, probably in open GL. But I don't know that much about mobile development.

As for use cases, this is what Sony has demoed so far:

* Scheduling events and networking between players (Drive Club).
* A second player interacting with the game using a touch screen in a similar manner to some Wii U games (Watch Dogs).
* Creating objects by drawing them on the touchscreen and putting them into the game (Playroom demo).

These are some other ideas.

* Allow you to access your character status, level, tech tree, inventory, etc when away from the game. This could include allowing you to use skill ups, discard and transfer inventory, and more.
* In games where you collect books, discs, or other sort of supplemental story information, you could access those later on your mobile device rather than on your tv in the middle of play.
* Access maps and quest/mission information.
* Using it as an input device instead of typing using the controller.
* Using it for character appearance customization.

Personally, I'm really excited about a lot of the possibilities. I think there are a lot of components of modern gaming that aren't best done on a TV. Every time I come across a book in skyrim, I think ""I wouldn't mind reading this, but it's awkward and hard to read on my TV."" And pushing some communications/networking functions to mobile devices could make it a lot easier to manage groups for co-op gaming.",,False,self,t5_2rrlp,False,,psn,True,t3_1gzo29,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1gzo29/the_playstation_app/,

Being furious he says he's going to call back to fix it. Never calls back (this was 3pm, 8pm right now). Just got off the phone with them after calling them myself and they say there is no way I will be getting a PS4 and that they are not to blame. I put this on hold the week of E3, ASAP, now I wont be getting a PS4 on launch because they made a mistake. How much longer after release do you think Sony will start shipping out more systems to Gamestop and can I at least pre-order one of the second shipment consoles or is there any kind of way I will be able to get a pre-order for launch anywhere? Amazon still has the standard edition but I have no idea when it will get here so I'm just guessing its best to get on from the store.

My first console ever was a PS1, and then I got a PS2 the week it came out and had a freaking blast for years with it. 

When *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion* came out, I got an Xbox 360 for Christmas of that year, and that game. I'm not sure exactly what influenced my decision to switch from Sony to Microsoft, but it probably had to with the PS3's astronomically high price when it came out due to the early Blu-ray adoption.

Sometime late last year I just became completely fed up with console gaming, I don't really know what happened, I just sort of lost interest in it. I had seen lots of YouTube videos showing how amazing games looked on the PC, and I found the modding community for my favorite games, Skyrim and Fallout: New Vegas.

It was in December of 2012 when I started planning my move to PC gaming. I extremely quickly ruled out pre-built and brand name gaming computers within the first hour of my research. The only real option was to build my own. Building my own PC was probably the funnest thing I've done in a long time.

I finished my build in February, and I have been enjoying the hell out of this PC. Everything I throw at it plays maxed out at 60 FPS, and still runs at 60 FPS even above max when I ass in mods and high-res texture packs and ENB/shader effects.

Now E3 has come and gone, and I just got so excited for the new PS4 even though I have this epic PC, but I just don't know why. I pre-ordered the PS4 Launch Edition on Amazon on impulse, and now that it is out of stock, I just can't bring myself to cancel the pre-order. I actually want this new console for some reason.

I don't really know what is going on. I thought I was done with console gaming forever.",,False,self,t5_2rrlp,False,,ps,True,t3_1gkijx,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1gkijx/why_am_i_so_excited_about_the_ps4_even_though_i/,

Today, Sony Online Entertainment has an answer: no. DC Universe Online is coming to the PlayStation 4 -- and so is Planetside 2, the first-person shooter MMO currently available for PC.

Seeing as how we don't know when the PS4 will be released, SOE kept the release dates for DCUO and Planetside 2 loose and simply said the PS4 versions will be available as free-to-play digital downloads this year.",,False,self,t5_2rrlp,False,,,True,t3_1fq8r2,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1fq8r2/ign_dc_universe_online_and_planetside_2_coming_to/,

I've been thinking about getting a PS3 just to have a BluRay player and play some of the exclusives that I've always wanted to, but should I just wait and buy a PS4 instead?  Is it going to be backwards compatible?

I was also wondering how the 'online' service works on PS4.  I knew it was free on earlier Playstations, but what do you get if you get the paid service?

Those are the main questions I had, but yeah, I'd love any information on it.  I didn't watch the official reveal and when I google questions there are just way to many articles for me to know where to begin so I figured I'd ask here.  Anything you think is a selling point for the PS4 I'd love to hear!  I'd also love to hear about any games that are going to be coming out for it.  Thanks!

The idea is this:

We gather a group of 15-20 people that have more or less the same interests when it comes to what we want out of games. We find each other on PSN, and maybe make some sort of group on facebook, reddit or similar. 

With enough people, it makes it so that when you have time to game on the PS4, there is always someone to play with. The reason for gathering, and not just go through /r/playdate, is so that there can be a familiarity between players, sorta like the guilds in mmorpgs used to be. 

The general ""hope"" for this would be a group of people that know each other through the PSN, so games like The Division or Destiny do not become some sort of ""i game alone""-thing.

It would be awesome if PSN allowed grouping of friends into guilds, with maybe some dedicated page on the playstation menu that could be checked to see what the other members are doing. Imagine turning on your ps4, checking the page and seeing that 4-5 of the people in your guild are playing killzone, and one guy is playing knack. Then you could join in and hang out with people you know (at least some), instead of the normal randoms.

I hope i get my idea across to you, but it might be a bit muddled since english is not my first language.
The reason i like this idea is that for a 25 year old guy, with a full job and not a lot of spare time, it is difficult to play with friends online. When you add in the fact that not everybody has the same games, the same schedule and so on, more often than not you play alone, or not online at all.

The creation of a gaming ""group"" or something, would solve most of this, and enable all of us to enjoy the content we want, when we want. (And make some new friends in the progress).

TL;DR: Destiny looks more fun with other people joining, than playing alone.


**EDIT:** 
Shit, i forgot the most important thing. HOW do we do this?
Do we just invite eachother, or do we create a subreddit like playdate but with the goal of permanent groupings?

I subscribed to PS+ last week, purely to get Hitman: Absolution &amp; whatever else showed up that I might want to muck around with on the ps3. When I saw Uncharted: Golden Abyss on there for free, my interest in the Vita grew significantly. I knew in passing that the Vita wasn't doing so well, so figured the prices on 2nd hand units should be pretty good, and I may as well take full advantage of my PS+ subscription, not to mention maybe getting a decent price on the Vita, should the PS4 revive its 2nd hand value.

Having spent the last two days having a good look around &amp; reading up on what early adopters do &amp; don't like about the system, I'm right on the edge as to how to proceed. I'm seeing 2nd hand units, still under warranty, around the $200-$250AUD mark, many with memory cards (the proprietary nature &amp; cost of which are one of the things really making me think twice) of various sizes, and other goodies bundled. Recent confirmation that everything but PS Eye titles will be fully playable from 4 to Vita also wets the appetite.

I guess I'm trying to find out a couple of things.
1) How many people here have pondered the same thing I am?
2) Have you come to a firm decision, and if so, which way did you go?

One of the key areas that would really highlight improved capability would be frame rate.

-How does the D-Pad feel? Mushy or Clicky?
-Does the controller have any grip on it?
-Do the Joysticks have any resistance to it?
-Do the Joysticks have any dead-zone?
-How do the L2/R2 triggers feel?
-How does the controller feel in small hands?

1371826351.0,41,self.PS4,1gsory,What could Sony do that could cause you to NOT buy the PS4?,70,29,171,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1gsory/what_could_sony_do_that_could_cause_you_to_not/,"Like many of you, I've been sold on the PS4 and against Adam Sessler's advice, I pre-ordered my PS4 the day after the Sony conference. They've (so far) proven to me that they've created a quality system with good games and multimedia services that I'll use. I have  Vita and PS+, so overall things are shaping up for a smooth transition into the next generation.

However, I think it's important to not assume that Sony can do no wrong. Let's not forget the disaster that was the PS3 reveal/launch. And even though I love my Vita, I think Sony has done exactly what Nintendo did with the 3DS when it comes to that system, and that frustrates me.

So I want to know fellow Sony fans, what could Sony do that would make you reconsider purchasing the PS4? I complied a list of some of my deal-breakers and would like to hear your thoughts.

* Not allowing previous PS+ and PSN purchases to be available through the Gakai service. This one is probably the biggest worry I have for the PS4. I have a large library of games I've gotten through PS+ and due to the PS+ discounts. I think the total is somewhere around 50. I would be incredibly upset if all the purchases I've made I would have to make *again* for Gakai. I refuse to pay twice for access to games from Sony when I've already done so **and** they're tied to that exact same account.

* PS Vita remote play not working as advertised. As I understand it, *all* PS4 games [Source: Eurogamer](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-sony-mandates-vita-remote-play-for-ps4-games) (minus those that use the move camera) will have the ability to naitvely use remote play and all developers are required to support it. If this ends up being false and I'm left with the same limited support I have with my PS3, I will not be buying a PS4. It's a major selling point for me, as a Vita owner, to have the ability to play Watchdogs or Drive Club from the comfort of my bed or while lounging in the student union.

* This is highly unlikely, but if PS+ was expanded to be required for media applications and access to free-to-play multiplayer games. I know it's highly unlikely, but this would end up with a system that is no different from XBL. And no amount of free games and discounts could make up for that in my eyes.


I know it's a short list, but Sony's done alot right this generation and has left me with little doubt in their pursuits. But, I'm a cautious gamer, so it remains to be seen if everything will go smoothly up until launch.",,False,self,t5_2rrlp,1371826578.0,,sce,True,t3_1gsory,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1gsory/what_could_sony_do_that_could_cause_you_to_not/,

I was curious if there are any things that are still unrevealed that would potentially push you away from the PS4. Ever since the event in February, I've been on-board; but there are still a number of details we don't know.

For one, the price. If it launches at $600 again (I doubt it will) that could be fairly disastrous.

Also, if online costs anything, I may be a little wary. Sure, all of the sharing/social stuff is awesome, and it may be justified to help finance the back-end of that; but perhaps they can just make ""basic sharing"" free, and more advanced stuff for Plus members? Regardless, we don't know yet.

But it got even better. 

We in The Netherlands have an online studentshop where you can buy software and accessories for lower prices. The catch is, is that you have to log in with your student id. It's called Surfspot.nl. The Sony store is a partner shop of that website, so if you click on the link to Sony while your on surfspot you get an extra discount. That's where I saw the low price.

TS: R is a F2P, fan-made, Crytek-approved reboot of the old classic. Currently it's scheduled to launch on PC late this year. When they posted the first concrete evidence that the project was being developed today, a lot of people in the comments (myself included) asked if it could come to the PS4. You can see the response above.

I've got high hopes for this. Crytek has been very generous with the license, and they'll want to get the game out to as many people as possible (especially since it literally costs them nothing to do this). Sony has also been super friendly to F2P games and independent developers. So, fingers crossed!

The highly anticipated Everquest Next will be revealed to the public for the first time at SOE Live **today** (August 2nd), 12pm PDT (9pm CEST).

What do we know about the game?

- free to play, massively multiplayer RPG

- giant, sandbox-style, living and breathing world with huge player interaction

- it will come to PC and is highly likely to be console-exclusive for PS4, considering all current SOE franchises (DCUO, PlanetSide 2) are announced for PS4

A few quotes from people who have already seen the game at E3, where it was shown behind closed curtains:

&gt; **MMORPG.com**:

&gt; This is going to sound like a cop-out, but we can't say why we are choosing EQN as our Best of Show because we've been sworn to secrecy until the big debut in August. What we can say is that we saw grand plans for the world's largest sandbox and it was more than enough to stand head and shoulders above any game we saw at E3. When Sony pulls back the curtain later this summer, you will not be disappointed. EverQuest Next is this year's E3 Best of Show, and in just a couple months you'll all understand why. We promise.

&gt; **TenTonHammer**:

&gt; While we are sworn to secrecy on exactly what we were shown, what we can say is that EverQuest Next was hands-down the best game we had the pleasure of seeing during E3 2013. Franchise fans and MMO gamers across the globe will be able to learn exactly why that’s the case on August 2nd during SOE Live when EQNext is given its grand unveiling.

&gt; Trust us when we say that you’ll want to mark that date on your calendar, and be prepared to bask in the warm glow of EverQuest Next in all its glory. In the meantime, kudos to the folks over at SOE for winning our Best of Show award; we’re as excited as you are to witness the impact EverQuest Next is surely going to have on gamers this August!

    cue Sony Press Conference  
  
Sony's press conference shows off all the amazing features and 10 PS4 gameplay videos, blowing our minds. At the end of the show they announce what the PS4 will cost, that it comes with 1TB or 2TB hard drive, the latter coming with a PS Vita bundled and Killzone Shadow Fall. Kaz arrives back to the stage with Jack Tretton to end the show, they say: ""Before we go, we have one last guest for you"" IT'S MOTHERFUCKING KEVIN BUTLER!  
Kevin Butler enters the stage, Kaz and Jack leave. Kevin Butler gives a motivational speech to the attendees about the idiocy of DRM, how gamers want to buy a gaming console not a box that can also play games, taking shots as Microsoft and their new console, while finishes with a triumphant ""LONG. LIVE. GAMING!!!""

The net is ablaze with laughter and ""WTF Microsoft!?"" videos, forum posts and flaming, people claiming they're heading straight to PS4 etc etc.

Microsoft's reveal was a disaster because of the lack of games on show, second-hand games DRM etc etc etc.

But...maybe they just struck first with the bad news?

Sony have said ""Used games will work on the PS4.""

That doesn't really answer anything, does it.  What's the caveat?

Yoshida from Sony has said

*""That's my expectation, that [used] PS4 games will work on [the] hardware. That's my expectation,"" he told us in an interview this morning. When we pushed to clarify what he meant, Yoshida stuttered. ""Ummm ... yeah. We have to really name our system services to explain more about it,""*

That last part just worries me.  I'd put money on them having a new service system coming, and they are keeping quiet until E3.  A new version of PlayStation Plus no doubt.  A new experience.

They've answered the question, but it seems they've given an answer as short as is required to actually answer said question.

""Will 2nd hand games work on the PS4?""

""Yes""

Is what has happened.

Now I'm thinking the ACTUAL answer, so they're technically not lying to us, is:

""Yes, 2nd-hand games will work on PS4, and will have no fee, if you are subscribed to PlayStation Plus.  If you aren't subscribed, you have to pay a fee equal to the full price of the game, or subscribe to PlayStation Plus.""  

Basically like Microsoft's retarded DRM.

""You never said anything about fees or requirement to be subscribed to the new service! WTF SONY!?""

""Well, you never asked.""

I'm getting a PS4 as I love the PlayStation exclusives (I hate Halo etc).

I just think there's a good chance that Sony are going to piss us off somehow at E3 with a DRM reveal.

Because it seems PS4 buyers are laughing at Microsoft due to the DRM on 2nd-hand games, and that's a massive dealbreaker for some (the whole 2nd-hand games issue).  So they're heading to PS4 because it ""WILL play used games.""

When...there seems to be no official response to it yet.

Are we counting our chickens before they hatch?

I was browsing through my PS3's games and came across some games that brought up really good memories. Then I came across the gem of [MAG](http://imgur.com/Yn9Ohlv) which really was one of my favorites. A game by many doomed to fail. All because they thought it would be a giant Lag-Fest due to the 256-player matches.

Just a ~~not~~ ~~so~~ brief introduction to people who don't know what MAG is.

MAG was created by Zipper interactive, which was shut down by Sony a while back, and supported the game greatly, bringing our many patches, multiple DLC's consisting of minor free packs to larger packs with new maps, game-modes, weapons and vehicles. They even released a 2.0 patch bringing in an economics system and a whole washlist of patch notes and fixes.

Players were given the choice of three PMC's (Private Military Companies), them being 

 * Valor, an army closely resembleing the current day armies of the United States or Great Britain, their operations mainly based in Alaska.

 * Raven, a highly technological army company located in Austria, fighting wars mainly in mid-america. 

 * SVER - Seryi Volk Executive Response, an army closely resembling terrorists and Russian soldiers fighting with mainly Kalashnikov-made weapons. They fight their battles mainly in the Soviet Area.

Who they would fight for on multiple gamemodes, earning enough wins would grant the PMC certain bonusses across all gamemodes which could include XP Bonusses or Commander Skill Cooldown Bonusses. They we're active until another army took control.

The PMC's would fight battles on 32v32 servers, with the fictional goal of gaining intel in the gamemode Sabotage. A 64v64 game mode called Acquisition where the goal was to obtain prototype APC's from the opposing faction. (This gamemode was particularly lobsided for the Raven army as their map was way stronger on defending sides, therefore Zipper decided to change up the system of having the defending army only play on the map in their area of operation. The change made it possible that Raven could defend an Alaskan Base which was clearly built in the Valor theme with SVER attacking them.)
 Then there was the Major Gamemode of MAG, Domination. Massive 256 player battles fought in two armies, four different platoons over four different sectors of the map. The goal, overtake the enemy's fueling station.

Then the next two gamemodes were DLC, the first one being escalation, the only gamemode to feature all three factions on one map fighting over a data centre. 32v32v32. and the other being Interdiction, which I don't know anything about because I didn't have the money to buy at that time, and when it was free on PS+ no one had it so I still couldn't play it.

The game was maybe not too visually pleasing, but there was hardly any lag problems from the server-side. The game was handled a chain of command system. On a 32 player teams gamemode there was one Platoon leader, who led four squadleaders. (squads consisted of 8 people). A player could only be squad leader if they were level 15 and to be platoon leader they had to have enough experience as a squad leader to be it. Squad an Platoon leaders each had their own abilities. Squad leaders could set squad objectives, and both leadership positions granted perks for surrounding friendlies.

on 64 player teams there were 2 platoon leaders both commanding 2 groups of 4 squads.

and lastly on 128 player teams there was another chain of command. Which was the Commander, who lead 4 platoon leaders who all commanded for squads. The commander also had an own set of AoE buffs and skills.

So after the introduction I'd like to tell you why I want a follow up to this game.

I think the game was ahead of it's time, that a lot of people weren't ready for such massive scale battles. At the start of the game a lot of people played MAG, the number slowly started to decrease as the value of cooperation and teamwork got so big that people not communicating where flamed on. (my experience, even though I was always communicating). That is where the game maybe lacked a bit. A small bluetooth headset to come with every copy of the game would have massively increased the potential of MAG.

Now the PS4 is way more powerfull than the PS3 and I think a new MAG game would be good to put forth relatively quickly since a lot of newcomers are entering the first person shooter market trying to knock Battlefield and Call of Duty of their thrones. 

I hope there is more people in here who think the same. At least I can sleep with a rested heart knowing that I have at least tried to get a follow up on one of my favorite games.

If you made it to the end, thanks for reading!

- New area of government keeps track of the conduits: Department of Unified Protection
- Condits have been identified, holding them without trial in containment facilities
- Department of Unified Protection shows its power during an operation that doesn’t go as planned in Seattle
- Transport vehicle crashes and the conduits escape
- DUP sets up roadblocks and won’t let anyone enter/leave
- Condits have been identified, holding them without trial in containment facilities
- Department of Unified Protection shows its power during an operation that doesn’t go as planned in Seattle
- Transport vehicle crashes and the conduits escape
- DUP sets up roadblocks and won’t let anyone enter/leave
- Lots of security systems are sent out and Seattle is turned into something reminisint of an airport
- There are elevated walkways with search-lights and security cameras as well as checkpoints and scanners
- Game has parallels to post-9/11 America setting
- Security vs. freedom theme
- DUP is like the TSA

DUP guards

- DUP guards feature behavior similar to that of SWAT teams/trained military police
- Others have a seemingly supernatural ability to shield themselves and move around quickly
- Sucker Punch won’t elaborate on this further

Protagonist

- Stars 24-year-old Native American Delsin Rowe
- Delsin is the artistic type with a chip on his soldier
- Fan of anti-authoritarian street art
- Likes tagging buildings with his own art
- Very much an average guy until the conduit-transport vehicle crashes
- Delsin tries to help those in the wreck, and learns that he’s been a conduit all along with dragging an injured conduit from the area
- Soon realizes that he can control smoke
- Natural power lets him absorb other conduits’ power
- Can use more than smoke power
- Delsin is excited about his power unlike Cole

Gameplay

- Delsin can take down different forward-operating bases run by the DUP around Seattle
- Can get through these areas with force, but eliminating security systems is more effective
- Smoke projectile at Delsin’s disposal
- Also can perform a smoke-dash maneuver somewhat like Nightcrawler
- Air ducts found all across Seattle
- Can use the ducts to get around or climb like Cole
- Another technique lets Delsin throw smoking fireballs
- When Delsin descends, he can perform a “move” like Cole’s thunder drop
- Forests act as the edge of the game world

General

- Sucker Punch recreated the city’s feel instead of specific road layout

This thread is obviously not just for Dad's opinions....but for anyone who can gauge a game for an age group. 

I have been out of gaming for about 2'years now, and the launch of the ps4 has sucked me back in. I have my Amazon BF4 PS+ launch ordered and I'm excited. 

I was considering pre ordering Lego Marvel Superheroes and an extra controller for my son, who will just be turning 6 at launch time, for us to play together.  Is this game something that will be over his head for that age?  The ESRB rating is 10+, but I know those aren't always the most accurate. He is VERY competitive at NSMBU, Skylanders and Donkey Kong Country 2 on his Wii U. Would this game fall into those categories?  I have 0 experience with the Lego games....but LMS looks like its going to be pretty cool, with over 100 playable superheroes. Please advise me if you can. 

I would just go pickup Lego batman 2 for ps3, and try it out, but I've recently traded that system in, to get credit for some future ps4 games. 

Thanks everyone!",,False,self,t5_2rrlp,False,,,True,t3_1k3byc,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1k3byc/dads_lego_marvel_superheroes_and_kids/,

I pretty much see my PS3 as a single player console, and do all my multiplayer on Xbox. With the PS4, it seems like Sony's way of catching up. I mean, they are using ""Cross Game Chat"" as a selling point. Maybe the PS4 will catch up in regards to the Multiplayer experience, but will it keep up with XB1? I'm confident that Sony will do it right this time around, but there's a small part of me that doesn't believe it simply because they haven't proved it(to me). Not to mention that the XB1 is already boasting Dedicated Servers and ""The Cloud"" which from what the guys at Respawn were saying actually seems like an interesting addition(though it definitely doesn't seem like a selling point so far).

My fears aside, the UI semi-demonstration video they put out looked fantastic. It looks fast, fluid, the messaging system look great, etc. I can't wait until we start getting more and more information on these systems.

What [Jack Tretton] talked about [on GameTrailers] is with the offline portion, there's no difference from PS3 - in that every game is playable on PS4,"" Yoshida said to CVG. ""In terms of just getting access of multiplayer online, it's now taken care of at a platform level by PS Plus.

""Tretton was on record during a GameTrailers interview saying that The DRM decision is going to have to be answered by the third parties, it's not something we're going to control, or dictate, or mandate, or implement."" But it's been made clear that the SCEA head was simply referring to redemption codes and online passes that have been in use this past generation. Sony has no hardware-level online checks or used game restriction technology in the PS4.

-------------------------------------

Publishers of PS4 games, then, can do what's already done on existing PlayStation software: Limit or lock content behind online passes or redemption codes (or opt out of restrictions altogether), which differs from Microsoft's limited licensing of Xbox One software.

[Source](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/11/e3-2013-ps4-used-game-restrictions-up-to-publishers)

----------------------------------------

The Online Pass program for PlayStation first-party games will not continue on PlayStation 4. Similar to PS3, we will not dictate the online used game strategy (the ability to play used games online) of its publishing partners. As announced last night, PS4 will not have any gating restrictions for used disc-based games. When a gamer buys a PS4 disc they have right to use that copy of the game, so they can trade-in the game at retail, sell it to another person, lend it to a friend, or keep it forever.

 * Will one's PSN purchase history will carry over to the cloud gaming service?

 * Will we be able to insert a disc and access the cloud version of that game while the disc is in the system.

 * Will the cloud gaming service will require an additional charge (or even tiered charges) or just allow for game purchases?

* Game Install Size - Will the PS4 still require double the memory of a game to install it like it does on the PS3?

* Will trophies instantly sync on PS4 like achievements do on Xbox 360?

* What will be the new friends list limit (if any)?

However, last week i bought a PS3 for the first time to try it out and see how i like it so i can make a better decision this coming generation and i have to say, when it comes to download speeds, im severly disappointed.

I have 100mbit/100mbit fibre connection corded straight into my PS3 and the download speeds is a joke. I rarely go past 1mb/s, which leaves about 90% of my potential downloadspeed unused. I have experimented by doing speedtests and downloading at my PC other stuff and i always max it out at 10-11mb/s. 

This is something Sony must improve for the PS4, with the digitalization and huge games. I got a PS+ subscription and basically had to leave my playstation powered on for three straight days and nights to download Junes games.

Is this something they have addressed and talked about? I feel this is a pretty big potential dealbreaker for me when it comes to the PS4.

FAQ),33,7,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1dy8nh/what_not_to_post_here_ie_what_is_considered/,"I've been seeing a lot of blogspam posted of late and we've been letting some of it go because there's little actual news at the moment.  But I want people to know that that will not continue much further.

**Q:** What is considered blogspam?

**A:** Recycled news and interviews from other sources.  There are exceptions like pieces focusing on a particular aspect of an interview but that's a thin line to walk.  If there's an English source you can post, you probably should post that instead.  **Reddit is not a place to seek clicks for your website.**

**Q:** What isn't considered blogspam?

Original content like reviews and editorials.  This is unless it's from an account that just mostly posts links from that particular site (and, to be clear, that's also against the reddit ToS).

**Q:** But why are IGN/Giant Bomb/Joystick/Polygon/etc. not considered blogspam when they aren't the source for something?  

**A:** They pretty much are considered blogspam in that instance.  We're just less likely to remove them because they are also pretty significant news makers themselves and folks have a harder time seeing the difference.  If you want to post an IGN/Giant Bomb/Joystick/Polygon/etc. review or news story they broke, that's great.  But if you want to post an IGN/Giant Bomb/Joystick/Polygon/etc. link that is just, say, recycling info from the PS Blog, we still **strongly recommend** posting the PS Blog link instead.

If PS2&gt;PS3 was HD, PS3&gt;PS4 will be FullHD since its 1080p. Well, probably not, but that would be funny.

My list is:

- God Of War Trilogy(1,2,3. Some people haven't played it yet, and they're missing out)

- Uncharted Trilogy(My favorite TPS series of all time)

- Little Big Planet 1 and 2(With backward compatibility so we could play same levels as PS3 version plays)

- Killzone Trilogy(With online co-op)

And many more I've forgot about.

I'd like to see Last Of Us and Beyound too, but those will probably stay PS3 exclusives for some time at least.

Also it would be super cool if they allowed us to play cross platform multiplayer(PS3 with PS4) like they do with PS3 and PS Vita.

For example, I have a PS3 and when I buy PS4, I can plug both in different TVs and have a lan party. 

**UPDATE:**

Some people, I think, misunderstood me.

No? Well let me refresh your memory. If, when you signed up for the SEN you were 17 and under, you have a sub account. If you were 18+, you have a master account. Master accounts have no limits, while sub accounts have spending limits, restrictions on redeeming gift cards, no social integration, game restrictions based on rating, and no credit/debit automatic usage. 

For parents who want to limit what their children do online, this is all well and fine, but the problem is that your account doesn't get upgraded when you age past the age limit, meaning that you are bound to life to whomever has your master account. This has caused a great deal of problems for people, and the only solution is to lose everything you have ln that account and start a new master account. Understandably, many people get upset when they find this out.

I'll get Watch_Dogs, but I'm not sure if that's what I want at launch since it's likely that I'll only have enough money for one game at launch, and I want something that I can play for potentially a few months without getting bored, so maybe something with online multiplayer? Killzone again is an option there, or maybe Battlefield 4?

The GPU on this system is no joke, my PC currently has a 7850 in it and I can play anything maxed out with playable framerates at a resolution higher then 1080p and that's with only 2GB of GDDR5.  The GPU on the PS4 is a step up from that GPU almost up to the 7870 which is still a great card.    
  

On top of that I only use 8GB of DDR3 since GDDR5 can't be used on PC's for system memory, the speed comparison is crazy 2133Mhz or in my case only 800Mhz vs 5500Mhz.    
  

  The CPU is a different story but hey the Jaguar is not bad considering developers will finally be able to make a game use more then 2-4 cores which is great and on top of that everyone seems to be getting the Bobcat CPU and Jaguar CPU mixed up, The Bobcat which is a step under the Jaguar runs at 1.6GHz -1.8Ghz while the Jaguar CPU which is only 4 cores in PC's run at 2Ghz+ and the one in the PS4 uses 8 Cores at 2Ghz+ not 1.6Ghz like many seem to be saying.    
  

TL;DR  
GPU = 7850 - 7870 with 8GB GDDR5  
CPU = Jaguar 8 Cores at 2GhZ+  (Bobcat is the one that runs 1.6Ghz)  
RAM = 8GB GDDR5 with 5500Mhz (System Shared between CPU and GPU/Still BOSS)  
Conclusion: Mid - High  (Day 1 purchase for me)
    

Also here's a pic I took on my PC to show the comparison between mostly the GPU on the PS4 and my 7850: [7850 vs PS4 GPU](http://i.imgur.com/uvrbHAx.jpg) EDIT: Updated PIC

    
I got ask a question as to why the Memory Speed on my GPU compared to the PS4 GPU has the same memory bandwidth at a lower speed 1375MHz vs the 5500MHz it is showing well heres a run down  
  
    
That's the effective speed of the Memory. Because GDDR5 is ""quad pumped,"" 1375 x 4 = 5500MHz (or 5.5GHz).


This is found on most modern graphics cards and RAM.  
- DRR3 1600MHz RAM is really running at 800MHz. (800 x 2 = 1600MHz)

I heard Digital Foundry mention that 7 minutes of 1080p in h.264 would be around 500mb, so depending on how much RAM is reserved for the system maybe they be able to keep most of the footage in RAM.

If it is being saved to the disk drive, and you choose to install an SSD, there could be a negative impact on the life of the drive, especially as many mid-range SSD's are now using TLC flash memory, which inherently has a shorter life-cycle than the more expensive SLC variety.

SSD's in general tolerate fewer writes to the disk than a traditional drive, although they are able to dynamically un-allocate areas of the flash memory that have had too many writes, you would after a few years end up with a decreasing amount of usable space. How long will drives last when they are being written to 100% of the time you are in game with large files?

Please forgive such a recent reposting for this but I thought it would be in everyone's interest to know the Soul Saga Kickstarter did reach the stretch goal for PS4/Vita (and Wii U) development. **You are now GUARANTEED a copy if you pledge at least $15.** If you pitch in $25, you can grab the PC version and another key for the console of your choice.

Now what matters is drumming up interest towards the remaining stretch goals and with 15 days remaining, anything could happen. As of this morning, the Kickstarter surpassed $90,000 so airships are now in the game. There is the potential for **a lot** of other features to also be added if another $60k can be raised so spread the word.

So, hardware revisions and surprises, can we reasonably expect any?

Sony told developers PlayStation 4 was equipped with 4GB of system memory, only informing them otherwise—it has 8GB—when they could conceal the truth no longer, as journalists assembled at the February press event in New York demanding basic specifications. Was this a genuine eleventh-hour negotiation or have Sony been downplaying the strength of their hand from the beginning, in order to misdirect their opponent—and if we consider the second of these possibilities to be true, is this the only ace up their sleeve?

Sony is vague about other key components. Take the GPU for example. Mark Cerny has [commented](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/191007/): ""It's ATI Radeon. Getting into specific numbers probably doesn't help clarify the situation much, except we took their most current technology, and performed a large number of modifications to it.""

Are Sony confident enough with their design to stand-up first and boldly announce all they have, unconcerned that Microsoft could make abrupt revisions to their own hardware, or have wiser minds planned for such a contingency, purposely holding back other important details? Analysts say Sony's design approach has more flexibility, leaving open the possibility of last-minute suprises.

Sony do seem convinced they have the better hardware, setting performance targets third-party developers themselves—at this point—are not certain they can deliver, as if the system designers have additional information yet to share. Stewart Gilray has [remarked](http://www.videogamer.com/news/sony_actively_pushing_for_60fps_1080p_with_ps4.html): ""We're working with Sony right now, and they're trying to actively push 60 frames per second, 1080p."" There were [reports](http://ps4daily.com/2013/02/playstation-4-cpu-runs-at-2-ghz-rumor/) soon after the February press event that the CPU clock speed is set at 2 GHz and not 1.6 GHz as currently believed.
