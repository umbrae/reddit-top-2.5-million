[Obviously, SPOILERS if you haven't finished the series.]",168,24,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/1fcid2/im_sure_thoughts_like_these_have_been_posted/,"*tone: intrigued, a touch excited*

I was talking to a friend about how it ends, and he said that while he loved the novels, he hated the very end, where King says it's the end... but if you'd like, you can continue reading and see what was in the Tower. My friend protested and said that little ""gimmick"" was bullshit and totally unnecessary, because *of course* we're going to keep reading and see what's in the Tower. Who wouldn't read that whole series and just be able to set the book down without *knowing*?

I started laughing. I had never verbalized before why I loved how he ended it, but my friend's protestations made it crystal clear: King *perfectly* puts the reader in Roland's shoes right there at the end. People tend to criticize Roland, citing that his need to *know* what's in the Tower is more important to him than even his companions. He risks everything just to climb those stairs. All the books are about his journey to know.

So as much as we, as readers, criticize his (possible lack of) morality and empathy, and curse him for his unfaltering drive, at the end of all things... we climb that Tower with him. King stops us and pulls us out of the story for a moment and makes us *choose* what we want to do. Are we content to walk away? Or do we, like Roland, have to *know*? And all of us, each of us, turned the page and climbed the stairs and completed the cycle. In that moment, we knew Roland. We were Roland.

I believe his obsession with the tower in the face of all the death and negativity it brings upon him and his loved ones is his damnation. His obsession to see the journey to the end is one and the same as ours. He will be freed from this cycle of pain once he and us as the readers stop at King's warning. Our obsession to read on is what damns Roland. Once we stop, he stops and we get a semi sweet, but most importantly, a FINAL, ending. And Roland gets his redemption. That's the way I see it. 

I don't think the horn has much to do with anything other than to show each time he gets closer to realizing what is most important. Friendship, loved ones, life.

I feel many people just see the warning as King being strange/copping out; failing to recognize the genius and importance behind it. The amount of times we as readers push on to the end is the amount of times Roland continues his damnation. When we all reached that warning for the first time there was no way we could just turn back so close to the end. And that's exactly the way Roland feels. It's a very creative way to mirror Roland's internal struggle in the reader and give us an opportunity to decide when his hell gives way.

Really, the ending is perfect, warning and all.",,False,,t5_2run7,1346573520.0,,eye,True,t3_z7kzr,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/z7kzr/roland_his_obsession_and_kings_warning/,

My little Roland, my little gunslinger. 

The story has always reminded me that there are no coincidences (at least in my life experiences) so I don't think that my boy being born on the 19th is a coincidence either. Ka is a wheel. And so my little Roland's journey begins. 

I write this in hopes that the fans who read this will wish him many long days and pleasant nights.

I just finished the Waste Lands this evening and with this second read through, I've actually found Blaine to be a rather sympathetic character.  The first time I read it, I found Blaine to be horribel, after all that's what we were told since Jake found the Charlie the Choo Choo book.  Yes, he did kill everyone in Lud.  And yes, he's trying to kill the ka-tet, but he's going insane.  And why?  Because the world has moved on.  Now, I read that as because the people who made him stopped taking care of him.  They stopped the maintenance.  And then, he states that the Grays and Pubes looked to him as a God and his programming told him to do as his creators needed.  Now the Grays and Pubes were not his creators, but they were human.  So what could he do but do as his programming tells him?  Add to that, his other half, Patricia, went so crazy that she committed suicide.  King doesn't go into great detail describing their relationship, but Patricia was practically Blaine's other half.  It's a very 2001/Hal approach.  These computers are only able to do as much as their programming allows them.  And what happens when that programming goes against itself?

Ultimately, I found him to be a sad and lonely entity.  The world moving on had truly taken its toll and I think Blaine is one of the best examples of that.

For those of you who haven't heard of it, Merlin is a BBC show about King Arthur and Merlin, where they are the same age and coming to rule Camelot. I know in the Dark Tower the line of Arthur Eld and Merlin and Maerlin and Mordrid are all supposed to assume that the King Arthur lore is the history here, but while watching the show I never put much thought to it, it seemed as if they wouldn't really touch upon anything related. 

But S05E06 is called The Dark Tower, and in it Arthur and the Knights wake up from having the same dream of finding this massive black stone pillar in the distance that they call the Dark Tower. Arthur says that all knights are taught to fear it and many have lost their lives to it. I haven't finished the episode but I got so excited I had to share.

Also, I may have to ask him non Dark Tower questions oddly enough. I was going to touch (pun intended) on Dr Sleep and returning to Danny after so long, then maybe ask him about his creative process and how he can write such impressively long books.

So I haven't finished reading The Hobbit, but I watched the movie last night and noticed several things in common between Blaine the Mono and Gollum. First, Blaine had a alter ego (Little Blaine), just like Gollum did (Smeagol). In The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins was lost in a mountain and needed Gollum to show him the exit, so they had a riddling contest. If Bilbo won, Gollum was to show him the way out. If Gollum won, he gets to eat Bilbo.  Bilbo won the contest by asking ""stupid"" riddles which Gollum said was unfair, and which he could not possibly know the answer to. 

In The Dark Tower, Blaine was defeated by ""stupid"" riddles as well, and if Blaine had won, he was to be able to kill the ka-tet. But, as we know, that didn't happen. I know King said somewhere that the Lord of the Rings stories gave him some inspiration for The Dark Tower, and I think this might have been one of those inspirations.

If the DT movie ever gets made, how would you feel about it starting with Roland in possesion of the Horn of Eld like at the end of DT7? I imagine the movies being a continuation of the books instead of an adaptation; assuming Stephen King has a hand in re-writing the ending with Roland arriving at the tower with the horn, would this excite or infuriate you constant readers?

You were potentially going to work on the adaptation of Stephen King's Dark Tower series, but now you're not. I imagine at one point these would have been lifelong-dream projects for you. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but are you feeling burned out on being this fixer and caretaker of preexisting properties? Are you looking to do something brand-new?**

Yes, very much so, but also, you know, when the phone rings or those dream opportunities sort of present themselves, it's really difficult to say no. I think there's a part of all of us — writers or directors or fanboys or whatnot — that, when you went into those worlds, imagined what you would do with it. And when somebody calls you and says, ""I'm going to give you the opportunity to manifest that, to make it real,"" you just say yes. That's what happened with Dark Tower. Entertainment Weekly brokered this little summit between us — J.J. and I, and Carlton — and Steve King. I'm just going to refer to him as Steve King, as if we are, like, best pals.

**Sure. Steve-arino.**

Steve. You know, Uncle Stevie, my buddy. We went to Bangor and spent this amazing, like, nine-hour period with him, the result of which afterward was that J.J. and Stephen started exchanging e-mails, and J.J. ended up optioning The Dark Tower series for 19 bucks — I was like, ""Oh, that's clever,"" because 19's a recurring number in The Dark Tower, and J.J.'s like, ""What?"" So J.J. and I had several conversations over the course of maybe a year or a year and a half. But once we actually started having those conversations, I just became filled with, like, ""Oh my god, I'm going to screw up this thing that I love. It's so hard to do it exactly right, and I'm just going to say that I'm too busy on Lost.""

Also, you've seen, like, amazingly talented filmmakers really struggling with those books. Is it a movie? Is it a TV series? Is it both? How do you work the time-travel elements of it? There's a boy, Jake, in the series, who becomes this pivotal sort of time-traveling lynchpin [throughout the books], and therefore you either have to have a 12-year-old who doesn't age, you know, or shoot, like, 50 hours of material while the kid is 11 to 13 — and since you can't do that, you either say, ""We're doing it as an animated thing, or we have to throw out that entire plot point of Jake.""

**It's the Walt problem on a massive scale.**

Yes. Oh my god. And the pivotal emotional moment in The Gunslinger, which is the first book, is Roland decides to let Jake die so that he can continue to go after the Man in Black, and then you revisit that moment like, five times over. Like, I ran into Akiva Goldsman, who was adapting it, and I was like, ""What are you going to do about Jake?"" And he was like, ""We've got a plan."" If I'd taken on The Dark Tower I would've become Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind. It would've happened very, very quickly.

For me I would die for a (purposeful) retelling of the original 7 books but with severe changes due to Roland having the Horn of Eld including:

* Exploring the ""New"" Gunslingers created by the Tet Corporation.
* Flagg/Crimson King/Mordred being more villainous/imposing. 
* Most importantly, a clear chain of events that can be traced back to having the Horn of Eld that results in a serious change, like Jake or Eddie surviving and entering the Tower with Roland (although waiting for him outside makes more sense).

It seems quite a bit of you guys haven't checked out the Dark Tower comic series. That is not good.

If you are a Dark Tower fan you owe it to yourself to read them. Not only does the comic's story line itself do an absolute ton of fleshing out Roland's past and showing events that he only mentions (Jericho Hill for example) in the book, there is an extra treat every issue at the end.

Robin Furth, SK's Dark Tower guru and assistant while writing the final 3 books, and a writer/producer of the comic, writes an end of issue article or story that is basically always some form of world building, or midworld history, or any other insight into the Dark Tower universe you can think of. All the shit that is glanced over or not fleshed out much in the books is thoroughly explored in these articles.

Unfortunately these awesome stories only appear in the single issue comics, not the trade anthologies. So you'll have to hunt down the issues at your local comic shop, or get digital copies from marvel or something.

Robin Furth has literally explained more backstory and lore about the Dark Tower universe in these end-of-issue stories than SK was able to ever dream of fitting in the saga itself.* 

Point is, if you don't read the Dark Tower comics you have forgetten the face of your father, and are missing out on a gigantic fountain of info about the story you love. Not to mention seeing what happens to Roland after Mejis but before The Gunslinger.

Upon reading the last page, under the shadow of foreboding cast by that ominous warning to not continue, as Roland at long last reaches the top of the Dark Tower, and the wheel of ka began yet another cruel, uncaring cycle, I felt a lead weight in the pit of my stomach that I haven't experienced from any other of the hundreds (if not thousands) of books I have read in my life- some certainly technically 'better' or 'more important,' but no book has drawn me to care for a cast of characters as I did for Roland and ka-tet.

I nearly burst into tears in the middle of a coffee shop, as in Algul Siento Eddie lay dying and the ka-tet was broken- when in a moment of pure, perfect 19, the coffee shop's radio began playing Hey Jude.

It took me nearly three years to finish the series after I started in my last year of school, despite being a fast reader. Not because I wasn't enjoying the stories, but because I think, in a way, I wanted the journey to last as long as possible. It took me almost a month to finish the last half of book 7. I am blown away by how much I loved these books- warts, flaws, deus ex machini (machinas?), and all.

It also got me thinking- and I apologize if these topics have been discussed to death- about the meaning of the ending. My first reaction was horror at the sheer, awful cruelty of Roland's fate. However, as I pondered further, I came to look at it in a different way.

I think that Roland is being the gift to try his journey again until he gets it right, each time gaining a little more insight and a little more personal growth and healing. He doesn't remember his previous journeys, but I think each one adds a little cumulative, sub-conscious effect- his soul remembers even if his mind does not. Perhaps on an earlier journey, he used Eddie as cannon fodder alone, letting the worthless junkie be killed by the mobsters, or didn't bother drawing Jake a second time to atone for killing him before.

On this particular quest for the Tower, Roland opted to abandon the horn at Jericho Hill, forsaking an heirloom with little utility so he could continue his quest. However, on the next turning of the Wheel, he has the horn- I think his ka-tet with Susannah, Jake, Eddie, and Oy taught Roland to value people, and treasure their memory, even in such a small action as taking three seconds to scoop up a fallen heirloom.

So why does Roland need to keep repeating his quest? Because he is doing it so very, very wrong. Roland is an utterly misguided hero- by putting the quest above all else, even the lives of those he must step over on the way, he has, as Gan tells him, filled the Dark Tower with death. Roland is the last Eld, and as such has an important metaphysical link to the tower- his life influences what the Tower means and contains. By living a life of violence and bloodshed, being known as a chary man who is doom to all he meets, he fills the Tower with blood and death- and the tower is the center of all reality. Roland is, in effect, destroying the world more effectively than the Crimson King ever could.

So, I think Roland must continue his pilgrimage, time and again, learning a lesson or two each time, until he can change his world view and approach the Tower with life rather than death. Perhaps Roland is wrong to remember the face of his father. Perhaps Roland, like Susannah, must see his gun as a used up relic whose time has passed, and set it aside. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I like to think that the ending contains that (tiny) note of hopeful optimism for our sorrowful Gunslinger.

Another question I came up with- how many times has Roland reached the Dark Tower? It seemed kind of impossible to figure at first, but then I realized there could only be one answer- this must be his 19th journey.

If you finished reading my overlong stream-of-consciousness rant, thanks for your time, and I look forward to any comments you may have on my thoughts!

As long as the people making this movie followed the same general outline, same characters, etc. then what we could be viewing is simply ka taking another spin of the wheel.] (/spoiler) 

This doesn't mean that Roland would or would not find a true ending to his quest or that personalities would be drastically different, but any subtle differences that usually sends fans of books into screaming fits over movie adaptations could actually be cheered and dissected by fans of King's magnum opus. 

Edit: I didn't mean for this turn into another should a movie be made or shouldn't it post, my point was just that it is a cool thought that IF something like this was ever made then the subtle changes shouldn't make the constant readers angry; they could [be from an entirely new trip to the Dark Tower for Roland.] (/spoiler)",,False,,t5_2run7,1360868811.0,,rose,True,t3_18io0q,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/18io0q/thinking_about_a_dark_tower_movieminiseries_and/,

This could explain how he's been alive for a seemingly impossible amount of time. I've read a few things that say he's immortal - but yet to run across anything in the series that would show him as immortal - he certainly seemed on the brink of death a few times.

SK makes a big deal about time only moving one way in the ""key world"", but then Roland goes back and restarts a healthy chunk of his quest.  Presumably that would mean that he also goes back and saves the Rose and the Writer again, despite time supposedly only moving one way in that world.

I see two general possibilities, with shades of detail.

First, the Tower (and by association Ka) is above such details.  By saving and reaching the top of the Tower, Roland gains...something, somthing intangible and unique to him, which in this case is the possibility of redemption.  Thus he is offered a second (third, fourth, seventeenth, millionth) chance to do the right thing, whatever that is.  The idea of the keyworld and, possibly, all of reality is secondary to the needs of he who is in the top room of the tower.

Second, that there IS something fundamentally different about this cycle, for some reason, and this is the one and only time that Roland and his ka-tet save the Rose and the Writer.  This would be in keeping somewhat with the idea that THIS cycle, out of all of them, is the one being recorded, the one worth noting.  It's not the one where Roland finds redemption, but it's the one where it becomes a possibility.  Every cycle after this one is another step toward Roland saving himself, which is only a hope after he has saved the keystones of reality.

Anyway, if you haven't done this, and you have the time, you should.  What's wonderful about the Dark Tower is not the plot but the world in which the plot exists.  I felt as though I was living in it.  You start seeing the Beam in the sky and have to catch yourself from saying ""Long Days and Pleasant Nights"" to the dude in the coffee shop.  You get scared to ride trains.  

And if you were like me and read it when you were younger, read it again.  The book (IMHO) is so much better as an adult.  The ending...I can't be mad.  He *tells* you to stop reading at the end after spending the whole 7 books informing you that Ka is a wheel.  I remember being furious when it first came out, and having read from the beginning I was much more understanding.  

Finally, since I was able to take my time I really thought about the plot (instead of ""JUST TELL ME WHATS IN THE TOWER"").  It's honestly...dumb?  There's a lot of points that are either too long or just unfulfilling (Ted's story, everything with Mordred, the self-reference).

I had read books I-IV years back and recently decided to go through again. 

I have to say I absolutely love the ending. I thought it was heartbreaking, yet allowed for a glimmer of hope at the same time. This might be the best part about the last three books.

I thought there was a lot of good things about books V-VII, but I also have a lot of complaints. I am finding when Googling reviews that these are the same complaints shared by a majority of people.

I thought SK including himself in the book was cheesy. I really think the focus should have stayed more on the importance of the Rose and the Wizard's Glass. Having himself as a character nearly spoiled these books for me.

Speaking of the Glass, I really wished Black Thirteen would have played more of a role in the story. Like the deaths of Mordred, Flagg, and the Crimson King, I thought King just glossed over it. It was really disappointing. I felt that the Crimson King and Flagg should have definitely played more of a role in the ending too.

Some things I really liked were the story of the Wolves, the Breakers and of course Roland's final climb up the Tower. All superb I thought.

I have read around that King thinks he might re-write books 5-7 and remove himself from the story. I think this would be a fantastic idea. Hopefully he would re-write the deaths of some of the bad guys too. 

I think his best opportunity would be to get this series on HBO a la Game of Thrones. George R. R. Martin helps with that series, and it's incredible. I think maybe King could help write the entire series and change up some of these minor story lines. It would also make it fresh for people who read the books.

Anyways, fantastic series like I said, and I'm sad it's over. I'm gonna pick up Wind Through the Keyhole. I hope it's good ;)

I thought the ending was perfect. For me, the best thing about it is that Stephen King gives the reader the choice to take Susannah's path and abandon the quest (that would be if you decided not to read after his warning and just accepted her happy ending) or to go along with Roland (reading the part where he climbs the tower, of course). If you choose Susannah's way out, you are free from the cycle. Your desire to remember these friends in this happy moment was greater than your desire for the tower. If, like Roland, your lust for the tower draws you into it with him, you are doomed to join him in the endless (maybe) cycle of questing for the tower, finding it, starting again at the beginning. In essence, the reader's lust for the tower damns him/her along with Roland (and thus we become tower junkies, constantly seeking but never truly satisfied).

I just think it was an ingenious way to include the reader in the quest, and in the resolution or repetition of the cycle. ",,False,,t5_2run7,False,,white,True,t3_mpe7n,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/mpe7n/just_finished_the_series_after_about_six_months/,

(Warning, comparing both books here, so the rest of the post will be spoilers)

- In The Hobbit, Gollum produces a challenge to Bilbo involving riddles. If Gollum wins, he'd kill &amp; eat Bilbo, if Bilbo won then he'd go free. In Wizard and Glass, Blaine offers a very similar challenge to the group.

- In the Hobbit, the narrator says how highly regarded riddle contests were and even the most evil of creatures adhered to their rules. In Wizard and Glass, Roland repeatedly says how important riddles were and the penalties that were handed out for cheaters.

- In The Hobbit, Bilbo accidentally wins by asking himself, ""What's in my pocket"" aloud and Gollum hears this and becomes enraged how it isn't an official riddle. It's just a question. In Wizard and Glass, Eddie Dean offers jokes as opposed to riddles, and the 'backwards logic' that riddles require made Blaine's circuitry corrupt even more. In fact, earlier in book 3, Roland even became irritated at Eddie for the nonsensical questions/jokes.

I am in no way calling King a plagiarist or anything like that. Just about every single King book is peppered with literary (and cinematic) movie references and comparisons. I'm just saying that I believe that the Blaine Riddle Contests were directly inspired by Bilbo &amp; Gollum's encounter in The Hobbit.

To add a small amount of wood to the fire, King has said that he is a huge fan of LotR, and even wrote The Stand in a 3-part saga ala LotR. Considering how much The Stand plays into the overall story of The Dark Tower, I think it makes it that much more a plausibility.

That said, the Old Ones are also responsible for the derelict situation of the world - the slow mutants, the wastelands, etc. Blaine says they had something ""much worse than a war"". I think the creation of mortal beams tied In-World, Roland's world, to two other worlds - Mid-World (which Roland admits he has only heard of in stories), and End-World, the seat of the Dark Tower (and not accessible except through the Beams). This explains the ruined state of the world(s) as the Great Old Ones literally merged several worlds together, out of hubris and lust for power (the Tower) - and then started fighting the other great kingdoms of these worlds (Lud vs. Gilead, for example).

I used to view the separate parts of the world (In-, Mid-, and End-) as just different areas of the same world. I think this theory about the Beams connecting several different worlds makes more sense, however.

Roland crosses the desert heading stubbornly SE. He climbs the giant mountains, and enters the darkness inside. He then emerges seemingly headed in a western direction, and seems to be in a very California-esque setting near what I suppose would be the DT analog of the Pacific sea... 

I am confused as to how he could have gotten turned around like this.
I think while in the tunnels the path turned leftwardly... but that would turn north. So, does someone have a convenient explanation for this? Am I thinking about it too hard?

I might be able to find this by googling or reading a wiki somewhere, but I don't want to come across something that will reveal where Roland heads next. I've never read the series before and I am really enjoying it a lot, so I'd like to maintain the delicate shroud of mystery as long as I can.

Yet they do wait, and when we have passed, they gather up their bundles of memory and fall in behind, treading in our footsteps and catching up, little by little.

This is book four, Roland thinking of Susan. But it stuck in my head. Made me wonder who or what is catching up behind me. So far I've escaped them, but I shudder to think what's back there. I don't particularly want to find out. Maybe I'll just try to keep a better watch on the roadside.

Your shadow at morning striding behind you	 
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;

So it took me about 3 months from start to finish - including a 2 week break trying to get through Wizard and Glass.

Though I did enjoy *The Gunslinger*, I thought it was a little slow moving for my personal take. I also found it hard to like Roland at first. 

*The Drawing of the Three* was what really hooked me. I loved the character development, the story line, the plot, everything. 

*The Waste Lands* was more of that. More drawing me into the story and making me really like the characters, the idea of Jake and Roland being in a paradox-like state. Meeting Oy. And of course the riddle contest. 

Now, I will admit I did have some problems with *Wizard and Glass* (as seen in previous posts). I was so hooked on the story of Roland's **present** Ka-tet that I didn't really want to back track into what his old one had done. This is where I took a break from the series, because no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't make myself commit to reading it. I powered through it though, and while it's probably last on my list, it did provide valuable insight into why Roland is the way he is. Moving right along.

*Wolves of the Calla* brought me right back to where I wanted to be. Action, Adventure, Suspense, more Character Development and **HOLY SHIT** Did I ever love Father Callahan being in it! *'Salem's Lot'* is one of my favourites, so I was happy to see an old friend. My heart continually broke for Jake and the sacrifices he makes and everything he endures throughout this book.

*Song of Susannah* was another one that I wasn't *crazy* about. I didn't like that the Ka-tet was split up. I love John Cullum and the role he inevitably plays in the series. I really didn't like how Stephen King puts himself as a character in the novels at first. But, again the role he plays makes it worth it in the end.

Now on to *The Dark Tower*. The longest of the 7, I will admit that starting it was daunting. But as soon as I did, man was I hooked! It took me merely 3 days to finish it. I felt betrayed at parts, heart broken, excited and happy. And again, seeing **Ted Brautigan** was a real treat. I say this a lot about a lot of books but *Hearts in Atlantis* was one of the first SK books I read, and it remains one of my favourites. I loved seeing Sheemie again!

Anyways, those were my thoughts! I'd love to hear what you guys think!

As far as decor, basically each room is going to be a different theme: our livingroom will be the prom scene from Carrie, the kitchen - The Dixie Pig, and so on.
But I really need some ideas for games and such we could do! I wanted to have at least one SK themed, like a guess-the-novel-from-the-picture one or something. But im clueless as to what else we could twist up! Any ideas? Any decor ideas would be great too! (I liked the thought of having ""REDRUM"" on my bathroom mirror...)

I think we are safe in saying that the Man in Black, born to the world as Walter O'Dim, is also our big baddie in the Stephen King universe. He is Randall Flagg, he is Nyarlathotep, he is Richard Fanin, Rudin Filaro, and every other RF you can think of. He is the Walking Dude.

But, my main concern is regarding who he may be instead of who he definitely is.

Is he Marten Broadcloak, that villain who taught Roland to hypnotize, and then used his trick to force Roland's trials of manhood? 

Is he John Farson, the Good Man, whose actions led to the Fall of Gilead and the death of young Roland's ka-tet?

I would have to say he is not these latter two. For one, the comics, say Marten Broadcloak is the son of Maerlyn, while we know Walter is the son of a farmer, and that he left home after being raped as a youth. While this is written by Robin Furth, the comics have been approved as canon by Stephen King, so where does that leave us?

John Farson seems to be a tougher issue to look into. Farson interacts regularly with Marten, but I have no recollection of any encounters with Walter. Using Farson as an alias for Walter would explain the disappearance of Farson and his army after the Battle of Jericho Hill. But, he had a nephew who helped infiltrate Gilead, and we don't know of Walter having any family...

Thoughts? I may just be rambling to myself, but I don't understand this devilish trio.

Are Marten, Walter and Farson the same? If not, what happened to Farson after Jericho Hill? ",,False,,t5_2run7,False,,unfound,True,t3_to8vp,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/to8vp/thoughts_on_walter_and_his_various_identities/,

",28,5,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/y089d/none_of_my_rl_friends_who_are_into_the_the_dt/,"First of all I did not expect the book to be so blatantly tied to DT. I figured there'd be a few ""Ah ha! I recognize that!"" moments and not much else. I did not expect to really learn more about the Tower itself and how it functions.

Here are a few discussions I've been dying to have:

1) How is King still so largely classified as a horror writer? Most of his best works have nothing to do with horror. The Stand, DT, Eyes of the Dragon and Insomnia are all more fantasy/thriller than horror and the Green Mile is.... I don't know, but it's not horror.

2) I also re-read Eyes of the Dragon recently and made an interesting connection. Walter/Flagg talks in Eyes about being *dim* pretty extensively. He says he cannot disappear completely and that magic is impossible, but he able to make himself mostly unseen by being *dim.* Now I always assumed this was just a weaker form of illusion, but after reading Insomnia I'm more inclined to believe that he is simply pushing himself up into another level of the tower like Ralph and Lois, but perhaps not realizing that is what he's doing.

**Edit:** Forgot to mention, Ralph specifically says something about being dim at one point, can't remember if it's about him or Lois, but that's when the light bulb clicked on.

Walter has also lived for hundreds of years and seems to have far better than average intuition. Magic, or perhaps an subconscious ability to see auras and steal life essence?

3) Who was Mama Roberts/Kingfish, was it actually the Crimson King? 

3a) Who is the 'Green Man.'

4) Who or what do you all think Old Dor truly was? Just a denizen of the tower who liked dipping into the world of the short-timers? 

5) When Ralph makes his compact with the Docs before confronting Ed and the god entity states that 'It may be so' he talks about all these colors he sees, and that he knows looking into them will drive him insane. Connection to the Bends o' the Bow perhaps? Roland emphasizes that all of the pieces had ways of twisting those who possess them, but I could just want to see connections that don't exist.

Lastly, I went back to re-read Eyes and just read insomnia for the first time. Outside of the DT, Green Mile and the Stand I really haven't read much King.

As for the beginning - the series panned out quite unlike what I was expecting. I had assumed it was basically Game of Thrones with guns, but it was closer to the Chronicles of Amber than anything.

1) Eddie vs Blaine

I've been wanting to read it for a while, and had the first four sitting on my bookshelf (I requested them as a Christmas present).  Typically I read nonfiction focused on Finance/Politics/History/Music, think biographies and stuff like that (favorites include Duff McKagan's autobiography, All the President's Men, and Too Big to Fail).

I was daunted to start the series (didn't want to be tied to reading seven books), but I'm glad I did it.  I was on pace for about a book/week, while Song of Susanah took me a bit (struggled through it, didn't like the crew apart), and the Dark Tower also took a couple of weeks (though only because of the length).

After looking through the history on this subreddit, it looks like there are mixed thoughts on the ending.  I loved it.  As I went through the Epilogue, it was becoming clearer what was going to happen, and when he finally landed back on the desert and I read that last line, my jaw dropped and I smiled.  I thought it was a perfect ending.  I've read a lot of the thoughts here on the ending and theories, and they're interesting.  I'm of the thought that he's been through this thousands of times, and the cycle will only end when he decides to abandon the quest.

I'm glad I took the time to go outside my comfort zone and read these books.  I haven't read any other Stephen King, and frankly I'm not sure I want to (the whole fantasy/western thing brought me in with this one, not the more vampire tyope stuff).  But this was an incredible series and I loved the journey, and I think the ending just made it that much sweeter.  I'd rank the books the this way:

1. Drawing of the Three
2. Wizard and Glass
3. Wolves of the Calla
4. The Dark Tower
5. The Wastelands
6. The Gunslinger
7. Song of Susanah

(Spoilers),31,6,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/1h5tzm/how_old_is_roland_exactly_spoilers/,"So I'm almost done with my second cycle of the books, and I've been wondering lately how old exactly Roland is. A lot of this is based on The Gunslinger, my favorite book of the series which I have read at least six or seven times.

In the original The Gunslinger, it's said that Roland spent 25 years learning how to do the reloading trick. Now, in the updated and revised edition, King says he had been doing the trick a thousand years. Then in the revised edition later when he hears Nort speak the high speech Roland thinks it has been centuries or millenniums since the last time he heard the high speech.

The latter example may have been exaggeration, but it is hard to take the first one as an exaggeration. The thing about the difference between the two editions that is so interesting is the Revised Edition acts as the start of a new cycle, if you were to read the original one, and then read the revised one after book seven.

That is why is is so interesting to see that while in the original edition, it may well be Roland's first cycle. He can be 30 years old when he catches the man in black, and they palaver 10 years, then he wakes up with the first patches of gray at 40 and it makes a lot of sense. 

I've thought maybe Roland does age slower than humans on our level of the tower do, as his years knocking around in search of the man in black would suggest. But if the revised edition is the start of a new cycle, which one is it?

It's a common theory that the books are Roland's 19th cycle, but is it possible it can been going on much longer than that? If Jake only ages at most 2-3 years in the books, and Roland has been this a thousand years, 19,000 years, how many cycles has he done through?",,False,,t5_2run7,False,,coffin,True,t3_1h5tzm,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/1h5tzm/how_old_is_roland_exactly_spoilers/,

I'm sure this has been discussed at some point, but it seems when most people discuss the ending of The Dark Tower they focus on Roland repeating his quest with the slight difference in that Roland is holding the Horn of Eld.  The way I read into the ending is more of a commentary by Stephen King about how you really only get one chance to write a specific book and once it is out you can't make any changes.  In that sense the decisions Roland makes are also writing decisions made by King.  I feel that perhaps if King could write the Dark Tower all over again with his current hindsight, he would write the series differently and as an example he would have included Roland  carrying the Horn of Eld in the beginning.  When he first wrote The Gunslinger, King had no way of knowing where the story was going to go and now that it is finishes, he sort of wishes he had a rewrite, and by extension a better ending for Roland.

Thoughts?  Hope that made a lick of sense.",,False,,t5_2run7,False,,,True,t3_1ctfpk,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/1ctfpk/is_the_ending_of_dt_a_commentary_on_the_process/,
1363994126.0,25,self.TheDarkTower,1atu1g,"Just finished this amazing series for the first time, some thoughts and questions (Spoilers Everywhere)",27,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/1atu1g/just_finished_this_amazing_series_for_the_first/,"I just finished the Dark tower series for the first time, and I loved (almost) every bit of it.  As I am left trying to sort out my feelings, and finally free to explore other people’s thoughts and ideas without the terrifying fear of running across spoilers; I figured that this was as good of a place as any to share some of my thoughts and also a few questions I had.

The first question that I hope is easy to clear up is about the nature of the Keystone worlds.  In *Song of Susannah*, Eddie and Roland clearly visit the Keystone world (no do-overs) in 1977 to trigger the creation of the Tet Corporation and influence King to continue writing the series.  At the same time Jake and Callahan are in NYC 1999 going after Susannah and Jake eventually exits back to the Tower world. Was that somehow also the keystone world?  Later, in book VII, Jake and Roland are again in the keystone world to Save King in 1999, and later Roland exits the world by going through the Dixie Pig which had apparently been very recently shot up by Jake and Callahan. I was under impression that due to the linear flow of time in the keystone world, you could only enter at *one* specific time. Or did the power of black thirteen somehow circumvent this rule?  If so, it seems like this could have easily led to disastrous consequences.

My second question was about Mordred’s telepathic abilities.  We see he is quite powerful, as he easily disposed of Walter who was even armed with a supposed dampening cap.  The ability isn’t mentioned much again except as a means for Mordred to obtain food, so it appears to work across a fairly good distance (at least when used on animals).  Why didn’t he use his abilities on Roland or Susannah?  I can think of any number of reasons, from their shared ancestry to their inherent “goodness”, but was it ever specifically mentioned why he didn’t at least try to mentally manipulate them, maybe while they were asleep?  Also it seemed like he could have used this ability on Patrick to cause all sorts of problems for Roland.  Was there some reason why Patrick would also be immune?

I can see why it was necessary for Susannah to leave the group before Roland made it to the tower, but in some ways I feel her decision to leave went contrary to her character.  It’s stated time and again that she, like Eddie and Jake, are gunslingers .  They have the skill and the character to be considered as such.  Although she’s suffered the loss of her love, and the trauma of being joined to Mia and carrying Mordred, it seemed like she gives in way too easily to the possibility of being together again with Eddie and Jake.  She clearly understands that (due to the clothing they are wearing in her dream) although they may be deeply connected in some way, these aren’t the actual people she lost, but rather similar ones from a parallel world.  It almost seems like an insult to the “real” Jake and Eddie that she knew to abandon the goal they all shared (even as a broken ka-tet).  Although there seemed to be no malevolence involved, I think this was Susannah’s real “temptation before victory” which she failed to resist.  Additionally, I can see how the Detta part of her was no fan of Roland or the Tower and how that influence made her decision that much easier.  In the end, I was just a bit disappointed how such a strong character seemed to give out so quickly to her desire to be reunited with her dead loved ones.  I guess my ideal end for her would have had her die protecting Roland against the Red King. As she expires, there would be a sequence where she sees Eddie and Jake waiting for her in the clearing at the end of the path.

As for the ending with Roland, I am fine with that, although a multitude of questions remain, letting your own imagination decide Roland’s ultimate fate seems as good an ending as any.  Even so, is there is any other literature or interview(s) where King discusses his own views on the matter?  I would like to know if he feels that the horn was literally an important element of Roland’s eventual salvation or more of a metaphorical element (I suppose there’s no reason why it can’t be both).

Anyway, it was an incredible series which from now on will be my gold standard for comparison to other epic series.  I’m left with a bittersweet feeling in thinking that few series will be able to match it, and fewer still, surpass.",!!Spoilers!!,False,,t5_2run7,False,spoiler,,True,t3_1atu1g,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/1atu1g/just_finished_this_amazing_series_for_the_first/,

Did anyone else feel as if the only thing to do once you'd finished was pick up The Gunslinger again?

As a lot of fans say, I was roped in during the second book. The character development was absolutely phenomenal, and I couldn't wait to see what the rest of the journey had in store. I've never felt so emotionally attached to not one character in a book, but a whole ka-tet of them. To say it was the best thing I've ever read would not be enough. I've been telling my fiance to start it ever since I started last year, so I'm hoping I can get him to pick it up soon. I love hearing what others think about it, and talking about it just makes me love it more. I find it incredibly hard to explain this feeling to others. The Dark Tower series holds a special place with me now, and always will.

I've been thinking about picking up IT over the past few days, but I almost can't bring myself to read anything else quite yet.

Given that one's a Taheen who seems to be genuinely becoming and the other seems to be fairly sympathetic (plus somewhat skeptical of the King's plans), wouldn't it seem logical to think that there'd be more to their characters at some point?

DON'T CLICK IF YOU HAVEN'T READ ALL THE BOOKS!],23,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/1cq6lc/a_film_universe_that_could_trounce_the_marvel/,"I've started thinking about how Marvel/Disney have kind of changed the rules concerning continuity and shared universes in film. Their ""*Phases*"" of the Marvel Film Universe and how popular the whole thing had become, and it gave me a terrific idea.

Are you ready?

What if a Production Company [Universal, Warner Bros, etc] were to great ""*The Dark Tower*"" film universe? I think it could be an amazing cash cow for whoever took the risk on it. I'm talking remakes of ""Salem's Lot"" &amp; ""Desperation"" &amp; ""The Stand"" &amp; ""Hearts in Atlantis"" all with an eye to connect with a series of Dark Tower films. How awesome would that be? And I think that it's already begun with Frank Darabont's ""The Mist"". It even had that Roland easter egg in the beginning. I figure the best way to connect this film would be to keep the same character design for the creatures in ""Waste Lands"". 

Just think of the possibilities. Recasting Father Callahan and telling his story true to what happened in the books... Recasting Randall Flagg and using the same actor in the Dark Tower Series of films... Dinky Earnshaw's ""Everything's Eventual"" would be another cool film...  I loved the casting of Anthony Hopkins as Ted Brautigan, but ""Hearts in Atlantis"" would have to be redone as well, making it more ""Tower"" related as it was in the story... Hell, even ""Wind Through the Keyhole"" would fit in nicely and along with ""Eyes of the Dragon"" would offer the studio brave enough to take this chance a couple great fantasy films that they could market to the LotR crowd...

I think if whoever is representing this property went to the studio with this idea in mind if might help their case. But what do you think, gunslingers? Does the idea draw what, as you do say? I suppose there will be water if god wills it.

**EDIT** I just thought of another thing! What about a television series that the studio could pick up after ""Song of Susannah"" dealing with the adventures of the Tet Corporation? AMC or HBO, mayhap?

“Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say ""I think,"" ""I am,"" but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. ***There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence***. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.”",,False,,t5_2run7,1370837004.0,,unfound,True,t3_1g0w8o,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/1g0w8o/found_the_rose_while_reading_emersons_selfreliance/,

Some of the poems weren’t too bad, once he gave them a chance. One was about a kind of knight—except in the poem he was called a “Childe”—and his search for a dark tower and whatever secret it contained. The poem didn’t really seem to end properly, though. The knight reached the tower and, well, that was it. David wanted to know what was in the tower, and what happened to the knight now that he’d reached it, but the poet obviously didn’t think that was important. It made David wonder about the kinds of people who wrote poems. Anyone could see that the poem was really only getting interesting when the knight reached the tower, but that was the point at which the poet decided to go off and write something else instead. Perhaps he had meant to come back to it and had simply forgotten, or maybe he couldn’t come up with a monster for the tower that was impressive enough. David had a vision of the poet, surrounded by bits of paper with lots of ideas for creatures crossed out or scribbled over

~~Werewolf.~~

~~Dragon.~~

~~Really big dragon.~~

~~Witch.~~

~~Really big witch.~~

~~Small witch.~~

David tried to give a form to the beast at the heart of the poem but found that he could not. It was more difficult than it appeared, for nothing quite seemed to fit.

The project would assign a few subscribers per book (tWTtK, as well). Their task would then be to splice the narrative in the most effective manner for film.  After all the books have been spliced, we make a crude ""storyboard"" of what /r/TheDarkTower believes to be the best adaption of the books.

Thoughts? Too Ambitious?

I was thinking of having an anthropomorphized turtle taking the place of one of the characters from a key scene, or maybe just going with something simple like Maturin or the skoldpadda. Turtles have a deeper significance for me personally, so the inclusion of a turtle in the picture doesn't necessarily have to make perfect sense within the framework of the story.

From my perspective, I can honestly say that I have never both loved and hated an ending so much in my entire life.

It is continuously being retold, Roland is still seeking the Tower, and if I pick up The Gunslinger right now and read it, I can feel that it is the beginning of the story, and not the history of the story I am re-reading.

Now, its not really that hard to pulp wood and whip up some keen stationery, so we have to assume that the knowledge to make paper was completely lost somewhere along the way.  How does an entire populace of people(scattered though they may be) lose that knowledge in its entirety? And what does this predicament symbolize if anything?

We know that Midworld was once a highly technologically advanced civilization, possibly with something like a Kindle being the norm. So perhaps paper was already a novelty at the time and that knowledge was only known to a few specialists?

Is there a deeper meaning to the shortage? I've always considered this the first breach of the Fourth Wall.

About a month ago, some of us [ranked the books](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/o1aof/hile_gunslingers_lets_us_palaver_on_the_books_in/). But the general feeling is that the story isn't so linear, and ranking the books does not help us appreciate them.

Also, as I'm about to finish my second run through of the books, I'm mighty curious to see what parts of the epic appealed to you all. So I made this simple survey to see if we're a lot of old school DT junkies (first four books), new school (last three books), or if merely different parts were better no matter when King wrote them.

I read an explanation by King, about how he received a fan letter from a dying lady, lamenting that she wouldn't know how the series ended.  In response, he whipped out 5-7 in a hurry.

I like 1-4 so much, that I rank the series among my favorite novels, but I still feel like 5-7 provide a lesser experience that doesn't quite deliver on the promise of 1-4.

I've been looking for a place to ask this... amazing to see a sub-reddit for The Dark Tower!

I've been slowly reading The Dark Tower--I've been really enjoying it but the enjoyment screeched to a halt in Book IV. I thought the book dragged on--everything I loved about the first three books wasn't really at play here. W+G made me realize that I was much more interested in the learning about the ""situation"" of the Dark Tower and less about the characters. I realize how weird that must sound, but I think it's true--I want to learn about this world, how it relates to ours, and what's holding it all together. W+G just felt diversionary, and very long.

This isn't to say its a bad book! I know there's a huge part of the Dark Tower fanbase that considers this the best in the series.

So here are my questions: is Wizard and Glass indicative of where the next three books are headed? If I didn't like Book IV, should I take it as a clue that the remaining volumes aren't for me? Or should I take it in the nuts and power through?

&gt;The look of slightly bored amusement left Jonas' face - *flew* from his face, as if slapped away. For one amazing moment the man with the white hair was a child again: shocked, shamed, and hurt.

&gt;""Yes, Cort's da - I see it in your eyes. And now you're here, on the Clean Sea... except you're really in the west. The soul of a man such as you can never leave the west.""

&gt;Jonas' gun was out and cocked in his hand with such speed that only Roland's extraordinary eyes were capable of marking the movement. There was a murmur from the men behind them - partly shock, mostly awe. 

&gt;""Jonas, don't be a fool!"" Lengyll snarled. ""You ain't killin em after we took the time and risk to hood em and tie their hooks, are ye?""

&gt;Jonas seemed to take no notice. His eyes were wide; the corners of his seamed mouth were trembling. ""Watch your words, Will Dearborn,"" he said in a low, hoarse voice. ""You want to watch em ever so close. I got two pounds of pressure on a three-pound trigger right this second.""

I wonder if any of you noticed it or have an explaination for it.

In ""Wolves of the Calla"" Ben Slightman and Andy go to the Dogan and contact Finli O'Tego via radio while Jake hides in the closet and overhears. Ben specifically mentions Roland and his plans, and Andy follows with a report via modem which we must assume contains even more detailed information regarding Roland's plot. The Wolves take the bait as Roland intended all along, thereby indicating Finli O'Tego must be associated with the Wolves.

Fast forward to Book VII and Pimli Prentiss and Finli walk through Algul Siento and chat. They discuss the Wolves not returning with children from the Calla and Finli proposes that the robots are old and worn down and they may well have malfunctioned. Pimli brings up the possibility of outside influence and Finli states that he would be surprised if the Calla fought back. Then Pimli specifically mentions he fears it may have been a Gunslinger and Finli openly scoffs at the idea. Wouldn't he have been at the very least, aware of the the organized resistance of the Calla via Slightman and Andy, if not the existence of Gunslinger involvement?

Is this just a continuity error, or is there a different explanation I don't comprehend? Is Finli hiding his knowledge from Pimli for some reason?

I'm getting this from the Dark Tower Concordance.

I have been a King fan since my very early youth- reading his short stories, and some of the more popular titles in 4th grade or so.  (I am 29 now.)

Today I finished the first in the Dark Tower series, and I... have never been more let down.  I mean, I was a little ""wah wah wah"" at the heavy handed ending to Under the Dome- but this was something else entirely.

Basically, I waded through two forewords- which both seemed a little bit ""I'm awesome"" and didn't hold enough of that King humbleness I am used to.  Then onto the book, which read sort of like one run on sentence, and introduced characters you cared about, to kill them all without and real emotion from our supposed hero.  I understand that King started this book when he was a teenager essentially, and I kept all of that in mind while reading it.  (""I am reading something that someone essentially ten years my junior wrote"".)  

So my honest question is- are the rest of the books in this same vein?  Does our hero gain a moral compass that is one we can get behind?  Is it honestly worth the investment of the other books, and the time spent reading them?

Go easy on me if your opinion differs from mine.  I am here because I do not want to prejudge and just give up.  You all seem (from lurking) to be highly intelligent, and worth listening to.

1316626589.0,14,self.TheDarkTower,kmxjx,Some thoughts on the Dark Tower Multiverse physics and Geography of All-World (Spoilers),16,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/kmxjx/some_thoughts_on_the_dark_tower_multiverse/,"Now that I'm finished, I've been thinking a bit on the relationship between All-World and Keystone Earth, and all of the worlds between. It seems to me the two main worlds exist as ""caps"" of time and the worlds between them are more fluid, with the Dark Tower functioning as a sort of backbone linking them all together. All-World exists in the furthest point of time in the future possible in the multi-verse. Keystone Earth exists in the furthest point of time in the past possible in the multi-verse. All-world is the train (or mono if it please ya) engine and K-Earth is the caboose (I realize the analogy is flawed here). In the earths in between, it is possible to jump forward and backward in time...to a point. My hypothesis is that the ""other worlds"" can only exist in time after K-Earth but before All-world.

A potential problem for this of course is the fact that Roland pulls Susannah from the early 60s, but in future books K-Earth is in the 70's. Obviously 20 years didn't pass in All-World between the time Susannah was pulled from her world and the time Roland and Jake went to K-Earth to save King, even though it is said that time moved faster on K-Earth than it did on All-World. This could solely be because of the effect the Breakers had on the beams, and it is not unreasonable to posit that the relationship between K-Earth time and All-World time might not have remained constant. K-Earth's time may have moved faster at some times and not quite so much faster at others. I also think I remember reading Ted Brautigan talking about how it ""slips"" forward once in a while.

Another interesting idea to throw out there is a possible tie-in with The Langoliers. Perhaps there are some worlds that detach from the tower, fall behind K-earth in time, and are ultimately eaten by the ""Langoliers"" who are in reality todash monsters. If, for example, the beams form some sort of cage around the multiverse, this would explain why the breaking of those beams results in those worlds being destroyed. A beam breaks, the worlds it holds in fly out into todash and are eaten. It also explains why some of the doors underneath the Crimson King's Castle led directly into todash. If all the beams broke (or all but one), then all the worlds would detach, the tower would snap and All-World and K-Earth would fall into todash as well.

I also gave some thought to the geography of All-World. I got the impression that All-World should roughly match the other worlds, even K-Earth, in geography. The references to real places in All-World make me think this. If Lud is where our New York City sits, then the Mohaine Desert could be a future desert covering Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The mountains Roland travels under could be the Appalachians, the Western Sea could be the Atlantic Ocean, which places Lud right where NYC is today. Then the Wastelands would be what was the Midwest, and Topeka sits where it sits. The Callas would be the western prairies. Empathica the rocky mountains, and the Dark Tower sitting somewhere in Nevada or California. I can't remember all the directions King notes that they traveled, but I've never seen a full, comprehensive map of the entire saga. I've seen maps of New Canaan, and the area between Tull and Lud but never the whole thing. It doesn't appear that anyone has ever attempted it.

EDIT: I've done some more thinking. If All-World's geography matches that of earth, where would the original baronies be located? My guess would be central or even Northern Mexico. This makes sense especially considering the prevalence of hispanic names in the culture; Ruiz, Delgato, etc. Perhaps in All-World's past something spurred the homogenization of White American and Latin culture. The entire culture seems to mimic that of the Southwest. Alternatively, the Baronies could also have been based in South America. Northern Argentina is a likely candidate for New Canaan. This also lengthens Roland's journey considerably, fitting better with the implied narrative.",,False,,t5_2run7,True,,white,True,t3_kmxjx,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/kmxjx/some_thoughts_on_the_dark_tower_multiverse/,

Eddie could be the addiction/obsession he had with Susan (especially the part of the book that's filled with them having sex day after day), Susannah could be something to do with the relationship (the two of them were almost as one; he lost his other half after she died, like Susannah's legs), and Jake could just be the fact that Roland was a young boy at the time.

He is definitely a great presence in the story. And if yours is Randall Flagg, tell us why? Don't be afraid to give a lengthy comment. I really want to know what draws you to your favorite villain.

I'll start: My favorite is a close race between Eldred Jonas--who is also my favorite secondary character--and Rhea of the Coos. The reason that I liked Jonas so much was the fact that he represented what Roland would've become if he had failed his test of manhood and was banished into exile. He was trained as a gunslinger and as we know that can make a person quite deadly. He was also intelligent. Their little game of cat and mouse in Mejis was really interesting. I would also go so far as to submit that he had the best death scene out of any villain in the whole of the series. Or at the very least the most satisfying ending. He came full circle (Ka, may it do ya fine), and when he saw the boy riding toward him with reins clenched in his teeth... It was pretty fucking awesome.

My second choice would be Rhea of the Coosl. Chaotic evil personified. She, perhaps more than any other villain in the series outside of RF, is responsible for the shaping of Roland as a character. Her inciting the people of Mejis to kill Susan Delgado haunts the Gunslinger's footsteps forever after. Not to mention the Pink Glass taking on her form to trick Roland into killing his mother.

Before I paste that topic here, I have just a couple things to say. 

I initially didn't think to post here because my idea will involve all of king's books, not only DT ones. I'm guessing there is a reason that you are subscribed to this subreddit and not the other, but maybe you just do not know it exists. 

The Dark Tower books would be included in books that we can discuss for the week, as selected by the votes. I recently finished the series myself and would love individual discussions on them.

Here is the copy paste.

So, I just finished reading Misery, and was interested to come on here and see old discussions on the book. Well, a quick search of ""Misery"" brought up nothing at all. I was slightly disappointed. This led to me having an idea.

What if, every week, we were to create a [discussion] topic about a particular book. Every week, we would discuss parts of that book, help other people remember reading it, and then perhaps we could also post a comment in that topic that said our vote for next week was whatever book we wanted.

Then, at the end of that weeks discussion, someone could tally up the votes and create the new topic.

It would be easy to avoid spoilers, simply post a spoiler tag in the topic title and then if you have not read the book and do not want to be spoiled, stay out of the topic!

If this idea take off, which I kinda hope it does, I would like to humbly suggest that the first book we discuss is either Misery or It, since I have very recently read both of them.

What does everyone think?

I've already gotten a few comments (all positive) about the idea, so if you guys like it too, then upvote this, comment it with ideas, or whatever to make sure a bunch of people see it.

OK, forget the whole do you like it, don't you like it question. What I'd like to know is how the cyclical nature of the ending relates to time. Basically, at the end of the novel Has time (events) reset itself or is it moving forward?


In the keystone world and near the tower, time only runs one way.  BUT Roland very clearly gets ported back to the desert and the cycle says he is again chasing the Man In Black. 


The Man in Black, as you will recall, went to the clearing at the end of the path following a less than successful tete a tete with a certain 8 legged 4 parented brat. 


So is Walter/Flagg alive again, in your opinion? Or would the gunslinger find himself forward in time pursuing someone already dead? or has he caught up to Walter/Flagg in every cycle? Or just in the last one? 


Does this mean the Breakers are back to breaking now? The wolves are back to wolfing?  


The implications of this are pretty broad. Because that means the tower is back in danger, and is in danger by its own volition more or less. 


Is it never really in danger, and the whole thing (aka reality) is basically a test for Roland (or existing in Roland's head). 


On the other hand, if time *is* moving forward, one could see Roland as Gan's defense system.  Roland thinks he's on a quest to find the tower, but Gan just keeps sending him out and giving him the hints necessary to protect itself.  I get the sense that Gan is the type of laid back entity that knows it is all powerful and that it only needs to give little pieces a shove now and then to protect itself. The Crimson King and all the breakers and all their little plans are nothing compared to it.

For quite a while now, (I say this with upmost respect to King and his writing.. nothing I do can compare, and I know this) I've been looking for some inspiration to start writing for fun. Possibly I could try writing an alternate version, from the point where Patrick steps from behind the rock to when Roland shouts the names of the dead as he heads towards the tower.

Basically my issue is this: Despite it being an imensely immaginative and unique story, it does slow down to an almost unbearable degree sometimes, often in conjunction with a very fast paced resolution. Wolves of the Calla being the prime example; very little actually happens for about a thousand pages, it's all build up towards the final battle, which is resolved quickly in a couple of chapters and I feel like the majority of the book was just filler.

I've felt the same way about many of the side plots, for example, Roland and Eddie spending ages convincing a guy to sign a contract that had little or nothing to do with the main characters or plot lines.

Same with Walter, they make him the primary antagonist of the series, the vendetta between him and Roland being one of the most thoroughly developed plot points of the series them have him offed by a relatively minor character who had nothing to do with Walter.

Also I may be thinking of something else but I'm fairly sure there was an entire chapter of one book pretty much devoted to describing how one unpleasant guy's knuckles crack and pop.

I don't mean to sound too critical because it most certainly deserves most of the praise the readers give it but the pacing feels way off to me at times.

I myself like to think so. I like to think that at some point during ""The Stand"" RF was walking the hidden highways, before he made it to Vegas--or maybe after he took control of Vegas--old Randall was taking the time to encounter Roland and his friends. 

But I digress. What do you guys think?",,False,,t5_2run7,False,,unfound,True,t3_rbwx0,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/rbwx0/the_stand_the_dark_tower_ideas_and_thoughts_major/,

I had always wanted to and figured I might as well start with what he considers his opus.  I read the gunslinger and was finding it hard to get through until nearing the end when I was blown away.  I just finished The Drawing of the Three today and really want to maximize my potential enjoyment.  While part of me is eager to read through each book in order without stopping just so I can know what happens sooner rather than later, I have nothing preventing me from reading some of SK's other works in between reading the DT series in order to get the most I can from the experience.  You can only read something for the first time once, right?

All that being said, while I am interested in interspersing the DT series with some of SK's other works, I'm not sure I want to read an entire novel in between the DT series novels if there is only a fleeting mention of a character here or there and no real plot points.  (I understand Rose Madder is an example of this?) Does that makes sense?

Anyway, I come to you, DT redditors, for advice.  If you were in my position, what would you read next? and after that?

Are they worth my Audible points (I did only pay a buck for 6 points, thank ya Kindle.)

All things serve the fucking Beam!

Thankee sais.

Afterword: I would first like to thank you all for your input. It's been great realizing what a ka King has brought us all to. 

I just finished book IV and as I delved into book V, the first book without Frank reading, I found a gem for all us listeners. 
King dedicated book V to Frank: ""This book is for Frank Muller, who hears the voices all in my head."" A well deserved dedication for a man who brought something so well to life in my imagination.

I am simultaneously excited to go through the ka-tet's journey but at the same time mentally girding my loins against the heart-break that I know is coming. To the point where I almost don't want to continue you reading - as if this will somehow make them all live longer! Usually re-reading takes the impact out of a book somewhat, but with DT7 I'm almost finding the reverse, knowing that the ka-tet will be broken is making me treasure each remaining moment with them and enjoy reading the book even more.

I'm also finding that where normally I read most everywhere (kindles are so handy) I am now purposefully making sure not to read in public. I'm dreading a scenario when I start sobbing and making embarrassing gulpy noises on the bus trying to explain to the people around me that someone just died. 'No not a real person, a character in a book, but you don't understand they're really awesome and...' Having got caught out without tissues the first time I read it I won't be doing that again!

I just thought I'd share the trials, tribulations and joy of re-reading DT7. What are your experiences of reading the book? Anyone actually end up quietly weeping on train? Did you find you enjoyed it more, the more times you've read it?
