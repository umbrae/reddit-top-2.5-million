I'm posting this to help myself by getting it out, and maybe help others who find themselves in a similar situation. I will not be coming back to the comments because I'm scared of what I'll read. (Edit: Man my curiosity is stronger than I thought. Thank you for the kind and eloquent words!)

Every test went swimmingly. With a few pretty-common bumps in the road, I got through my first trimester and was settling into my second. I had waited until 19 weeks to tell most people, even though they say you're safe after the first trimester. Though all the tests were good - very good - I kept having nightmares that something went wrong. I began to have a gnawing feeling that I was not going to have this baby. I attributed it to my life-long anxiety and depression; that I simply couldn't believe I was going to have a wonderful little being.

Since things were so good, my doctor said I could wait until 20 weeks for the ultrasound where they check the baby physically and identify the sex. I thought I was going in for a routine ultrasound and would find out whether I was having a girl or a boy.

To my untrained eye, everything looked good as I lay on the table, looking up at the black and white screen with my husband. Baby was moving all around, and I could tell without the tech telling me that it was a boy.

The tech, though, had a very strange look on her face. She was spending a very, very long time on the baby's heart. She tried to find other techs to look, but it was the last appointment of the day and they had all gone home. She moved on, measured other things, and confirmed that he was a boy. She then told us that we needed to have a fetal echocardiogram. She said, ""I'm just a tech, I can't confirm anything right now, and nothing could be wrong. You need to get a level 2 ultrasound and echocardiogram."" There isn't much more she would tell us. 

I called my doctor the next morning, and he tried to be comforting but said, ""We're not seeing everything we want to."" ""Are you saying parts of his heart are missing?"" ""It looks that way.""

The days leading up to the next appointment were the longest of my life... up until that point, at least.

We went into the level two and met with a tech first. She was cheerful and I asked if she would give us pictures. She said yes. As she conducted the test, I saw a look on her face similar to the first tech. This tech printed no pictures and barely said anything to us. It was like she saw a ghost. She told us the doctor was watching and he would come in to do the echo.

The doctor came in and introduced himself, then asked if we wanted him to narrate what he was seeing as he went through the echo. This part is a haze, but he told us he was basically seeing half a heart, as well as other internal structural issues. He then told us no one in the region was equipped to deal with the syndrome he thought our baby had, and we needed to go to a special hospital. To avoid identifying myself, I'm leaving out the syndrome and the hospital. 

The hospital scheduled to see us the very next morning for another echo. They called me and told me that I needed to know one of the things they would talk to me about was ending my pregnancy, and I needed to be prepared for that topic to come up.

Of course I wouldn't, I told the nurse. I'll never forget her words. ""No one thinks they would until they're presented with all of the facts. Just keep your mind open when you come tomorrow.""

They saw us first thing the next morning. We saw a pediatric cardiologist that I later learned was the best in the country for what we were facing. He was very kind, but his prognosis was horrifying. Our baby had numerous internal issues. Again, if I explain them, I'd be easy to find. He explained there was a spectrum for children with this syndrome. Some were able to live into their late teens and even go to school. Others died within the first couple weeks of life. Our baby, he said, was on the worst end of the spectrum. He told us all the things he would do if we decided to proceed: all the surgeries, the inevitable transplants, the requirements for our home if he was able to come home. If we moved forward, they would do whatever they could to keep him alive.

The doctor then left, and the nurse stayed. They brought in a social worker to talk through our options. But it sounded like there were no options. She only talked about the option where we didn't have our baby.

I've never been so out of my mind. Angry, sad, self-hating, life-hating... every negative emotion was all there, all at once. I wanted nothing more in my life than to have this baby.

They told us we had a week to make a decision (for legal reasons in my state) .

At first, I thought, of course I will have this baby. Maybe he'll be lucky. Maybe they're wrong. Lots of kids are sick. Other people have babies like this. I reached out to the community of parents with babies with this syndrome (online.) And of course, their advice in the public forum was to proceed. Yet none of them knew the extent of their child's issues before the child was born. I was ""lucky"" in that way. I looked at their albums of their babies: little babies that lived in hospitals or on machines at home. The ones at the end of the spectrum with us; they weren't making it past nine months. Nine months on machines with tubes going in and out, everywhere. Massive open heart and open stomach surgeries. 

One woman messaged me privately to give me the advice none of the rest had. 

Then another woman. And another.

Then finally one that had made the decision to end the pregnancy.

My husband and I saw our doctor, and then our rabbi. The rabbi played out both scenarios with us. She said either way, the community would support us, and that we should very seriously consider the fact that we had the power to prevent him from suffering.

Everyone around me had already made their decision for what they thought I should do, including my husband. Though the hardest decision he ever made, he had made it from the moment we met with the cardiologist. 

I was completely willing to give up my job, my home, anything to care for him. I wanted him more than anything. But what would he want? To live a few weeks to a few months in horrible pain? Or maybe live to be old enough to know he was going to die very young? 

Some people say, a life is better than no life. But is it? That was the decision I was faced with.

And so as you can tell from the title, I made my decision.

At five months, a baby is about twelve inches long and over a pound. They look like any other baby you've seen, just smaller. And now the decision was, a D&amp;C, or delivery? This was an easy one for me, but I learned later it's not easy for a lot of people. Delivery was the only option in my mind. I felt badly later when I talked to a friend who had to end a pregnancy at five months for medical reasons. I assumed she delivered, but she didn't. She chose a different road. We delivered our baby. We named him. We held him, and we buried him near my grandmother. My friend had a D&amp;C, her husband didn't even want to know the sex, and she didn't name nor bury her baby. And that was her choice; the choice she thought was best for she and her family. I don't judge her, but I can say she was envious that we were ""strong enough"" as she put it, to hold him. To face him I suppose. I felt I owed him at least that.

His headstone was recently put in, and I guess that's why I'm writing this now. It's bringing everything back. 

I want you all to know that you have choices. 

You may have support, you may not. One person I've connected with had no support from her family. I was lucky to have my family's full support no matter what we decided. Though, after, each one of them confessed they wanted us to make the choice we made and not to allow him to live a short and painful life.

I am terrified that people will judge me harshly for this. Even strangers. No one would say it to my face, of course, but now I'm here filling up nearly 10,000 characters telling strangers, and I know what doors that opens. It's ok to disagree with my decision, but like the nurse told me, you never know what you will do when it's actually your turn to decide. Keep an open mind, do what's best in your situation. Know that I am here, supporting whatever decision you make.

On the day of the burial, I approached the tiny open grave and wanted nothing more than to crawl in there with him. It would be ok to be dead, I thought. I have to say, it's been nine months and I still feel that way many days. I'm still angry, mad, confused. But every day I find some peace knowing I loved him even though I held him once, and that if I ever happen to meet him in the great beyond, that he'll forgive me.",,False,,t5_2r2jt,1375917124.0,allstatus,,True,t3_1imp4j,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1imp4j/ending_my_pregnancy_at_five_months_the_last_thing/,

A little while later, things progressed on to talking about false rape allegations, when the same guy stated how disgusting false rape claims are and how those women deserve to be put in jail. My quiet female coworker who hadn't said much up til this point then chirped up with: ""*Hey dude, while no man chooses to be falsely accused, they do choose the situations they get themselves into, so you know, those men contributed to their own convictions.""*

WELL ALL WENT SILENT. She was clearly being sarcastic, but this guy had no idea what to say! He started to say ""that's not--"" but tapered off and got embarrassed.

I'm in my late 30's, not on any birth control. I would give the myriad excuses... but the simple fact is I've had sex about 3 times in 2 years, and I don't (normally) care enough about it to bother.

So last Saturday, after a few drinks, a friend and I ended up having sex. I had another occasion like this, 2 years ago. I trusted the Army and went to the on-post pharmacy for Plan B (for free).

It was the most awful, degrading experience of my life. Not only did the highly judgmental pharmacist ask me how it happened, and made sure to let me know that I was using ONE of my THREE opportunities to use this prescription.... he made an entry in my health record. 

Two months after that, I had the sheer FORTUNE of having my annual women's exam with an amazing PA. She pointed out that there was an entry in my medical records for ""Sexual Deviancy"". That's right, ladies. Screw up? Need plan B? No one is blaming myself more than ME... but you are a fucking SEXUAL DEVIANT. 

Fast forward to last weekend. I'm debating which pharmacy to choose, and my 72 hours is fast running out. Pulled off the interstate for dinner, and spotted a neighborhood pharmacy. Dicey bet... small town, small minds... but it's empty, and I go for it. In uniform. (On my way home from work)

Me: ""Sir, do you sell Plan B?""

Him: ""Yes, ma'am!"" (Goes to the back to grab it)

Him: ""Are you over 18? hardy-har-har""

Me: ""Yes, sir""

Him: ""Well, now we have that sorted out! Have you used this before?""

Me: ""No, sir"" (god forbid I can admit that I've fucked up twice)

Him: ""Well, it's pretty straight-forward!"" (shows me the directions)

Me: ""I'm certainly old enough to know better.""

Him: ""What age is that? Because I mess up all the time!""

I was dumbstruck. He was in his late 50's. Amazingly kind, seemed more concerned about putting me at ease. I'm dead touched... and will pay full price and use his pharmacy until the end of time.

Edit: Thank you all for your kind wishes. I wish I had reported that pharmacist at the time, but that was 2 installations ago, and I really don't want it to come up again at this point in my career. The PA who informed me of the note in my record DID remove it for me. It's significant, because I am in Aviation, and a flight doc can revoke my flight status over damn near anything.

To those military care-givers who weighed in, and were appalled by how I was treated, THANK YOU... sincerely... from the bottom of my heart. I'm so glad that there are people like you doing what you do. 


Edit 2: The other person in this scenario is indeed my good friend with as inactive a sex life as my own (because of our jobs). We both talked about it afterwards and were pissed at ourselves for not using a condom. We were drinking boxed wine and playing Guitar Hero. Recipe for disaster, apparently. He knows me well enough to know that I don't date, and that I'm on zero birth control. He offered to pay for the Plan B, but that's genuinely not necessary, and I appreciated the gesture. 

STI's are insanely dangerous, and I realize what I terrible risk we took. I looked up my local PP office, and will go there to be tested.

My hair is naturally very curly, and I hated how it looked, so I straightened the shit out of it for more than an hour every day to keep it under control. I also started wearing makeup around the age of 11, and within a year or two, I relied on it so heavily that I wouldn't leave the house without it. My hair and makeup became somewhat of an identity for me, or at the very least, a safe place to hide from the cruelty of preteen girls (spoiler: *nothing* protects you from the cruelty of preteen girls).

When I was fifteen I specifically remember telling myself that I would never, under any circumstances, ever leave my house without doing both my hair and makeup and that doing so would surely be the greatest indicator that I have given up on life. 

I have since successfully defeated the embarrassment over my hair, and I have been wearing it natural for almost a year now. My mom believes I went natural because I stopped caring about myself, and if it wasn't for the positive impact the switch had on my life, I might have agreed with her. But shit, one hour a day to straighten my hair was draining a whole lot of my time and energy, and going natural just seemed like the right thing to do. Sorry, Mom (but really I'm not).

I am able to apply my basic makeup (foundation, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara) in less than five minutes now. I really enjoy makeup, so it's not any inconvenience or problem to do it daily. That being said, I have never in my life gone out my front door without makeup because I was so horrified with my natural state and assumed others would be too.

But last night I made the bold decision to go out with my natural hair *and* sans makeup. It was such a huge accomplishment in loving myself, and now I know younger me has no authority or power over me. I am no longer the self loathing, miserable, insecure girl I was just years ago. I am a grown woman who loves herself (and who still loves makeup), and I couldn't be more thrilled!

I know not everyone is the same, obviously, and I mean **absolutely no offense** to anyone on TwoX, but what's the big deal? I see posts all the time about guys being inappropriate and girls getting super offended. What is wrong with telling them ""hey, man, don't be a dick"" instead of getting pissed and running away like you're a victim? I just feel like lots of girls overreact about 'sexual harassment' on here. I understand that a stranger hitting on you is creepy and unsettling, I understand that a friend grabbing your butt is uncomfortable, but why not *say something* and get on with your life?

I'll probably get downvoted to hell, but I'm genuinely curious about what you ladies think about my mindset versus what seems to be the collective mindset here.

Thanks, girls!

**Edit:** Holy crap. I was *not* expecting this to get as much attention as it is getting. Let me hit on a few points mentioned instead of replying to every single comment.

1. I have been harassed too many times to count. I've been raped, and been to therapy for it. I *do* know    how it feels, and I am empathetic when it comes down to it.
2. Most men who are rude and harass women do it just because they're women and they *want* to humiliate them. 
3. This is a public forum, just like the rest of reddit, but it is not specifically for feminism/rape/sexual harassment. That's why I'm bringing this up.
4. Ignoring crude comments from people is probably just as effective, if not more effective as telling them off (in my experiences).

**Edit:** Just to clarify, I **am not** talking about rape, and I **am not** talking about when someone physically harms you. People are getting quite touchy and acting like I'm judging them. I most certainly am not, I'm just asking a question.

**EDIT: People on here seem to think that I'm telling them what to do. I'm not, I'm just asking why they don't stick up for themselves when things like this happen. Obviously, we aren't all the same, I'm trying to understand the mindframe of girls who can't/won't say anything.**",,False,,t5_2r2jt,1351558843.0,allstatus,,True,t3_129u9e,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/129u9e/i_know_twox_isnt_for_everyone_but_is_there/,

I went back to college at 40, got my B.S. at 45. My former career was as a musician and I always kind of felt like I was too ""creative"" to be a ""real"" scientist. I graduated with high honors, got scholarships and awards, but attributed all that that to just having the follow-through-it-ness of an empty-nest mom on a mission.

Genetics always fascinated me. I did my internship at a genetics testing place with some intimidatingly smart, admirable women doctors. I discovered that I had a knack for karyotyping (organizing chromosomes by sight). I mean, c'mon...moms know how to organize things, right? My creativeness was actually really helpful for the pattern recognition needed to sort out chromosomes- a skill I possessed that they said they had never seen the likes of. 

Fast-forward five years. Out of nowhere, they contacted me. I met with them this week and they told me that I was the best intern they ever had! When they recently lost a full-timer, my name came up. After 5 years and many many other interns, they wanted ME to fill the position doing tissue culture and karyotyping. I could just pee. It's everything I worked for. They are eager to teach me as much about genetics as I am willing to learn. I will learn ALL THE THINGS! Best week ever. I am closing in on 50 and I have a new career and I actually feel like I am a real scientist! Moral of this story, you are NEVER too old.

That's right. Planned Parenthood.

Why?

Well, not because I am not terminating a pregnancy, looking for prophylactics, treating an STI or anything else like that. (All those ""dirty whore"" things that people love to hate on.) Actually, I am sick and I can't get well. Down there. Not that it really matters why. (TMI?)

You know they do that at Planned Parenthood, right? They help women who are sick. Who need help down there. 

And sometimes ""down there help"" does include terminating a pregnancy, getting prophylactics, or treating an STI. Sometimes it's cancer screening, diagnosing ovarian cysts, treating irregular periods, investigating pain that won't go away. Down there gets complicated.

I don't have medical insurance. Not because I am reckless, stupid, ""dependent on the state"" or anything even close to that. And not because I like to gamble.

I am a freelancer with no ""employer provided plan."" I am member of 3 unions who can barely afford to cover their members, so they just keep putting more and more restrictions on that coverage. I cannot afford ""independent insurance"" as the New York state premiums are so high that it would cripple my household to pay the monthly rate. Oh, and Healthy New York? Well, I'm too rich to qualify. Too freakin' rich. (Come over and hang out on my yacht sometime.)

I am white, middle class, educated, married, and employed. Double income, no kids. (I have all the safety nets, right?) I pay my bills and taxes. I have held up every end of the bargain that is the American dream and I am nobody's charity case. I am paying for my visit. Because I can and because, if I can, I should. And because my money will help the next woman who can't.

I am sick and I can't get well. Sick enough that I can't wait for another program to approve me for a doctors visit. I can't wait until I can afford insured healthcare. I can't even wait for the ""promised land"" of ""Obamacare."" 

I'm sick right now.

And I'm lucky to be sitting here in a safe facility, surrounded by a compassionate and professional staff that is insuring that I will get help today. They are so funny, helpful, and positive.

I am also surrounded by a multitude of diverse women, old and young, well-heeled and Payless, black, Latina, Asian, Arab and yes, white-as-bleached-towels like me. Some of them are chatty, some of them are pensive, some of them are downright terrified. But, whatever the reason they are here, none of them are ""dirty whores."" They are just women who need help with a medical problem. Right now. And this might be their only resource.

And (thank the good lord above) that Planned Parenthood is here to provide help to them. And help to me. Your friend, Jenny Wren [waving at the camera].

When I arrived today, I had to go through a full security screening like what you see at an airport and I thought, ""Seriously? why would someone bring a gun to the gynecologist?""

And then, ""Oh. . . Oh my god. I forgot."" 

I actually forgot for a moment that there are people who hate Planned Parenthood. Who want to stop Planned Parenthood. And that there are people who would not simply use legislation or bullying to accomplish that. 

Once I enter this building I am not safe. Because there are people who WANT TO KILL the doctors for providing care ""down there."" There are people who WANT TO KILL me for coming here. That think I'm a ""whore."""" A not just a woman who needs to see a doctor for a reason that is nobody's business. 

I stand with Planned Parenthood. I stand for a women's choice, privacy,
and access to medical care. 

I stand with Julia who treated me, LaVinna who ran my lab tests and Stan the guard who told me to have nice day. (You too, Stan.)

I stand with all the other women I encountered in the clinic: alone, with friends, wearing hospital gowns, reading magazines, getting tests.

This November, stand with me.

Due to my place in one of the most liberal cities in the United States, I am spared a lot of the ignorance and conservative viewpoints prevalent in many other parts of the country.

Today in Union Square the World Life Organization had a HUGE stage up, complete with a big screen tv flashing pictures of dismembered fetuses. I couldn't help but stare at the crowd of 200, the weepy women going up and saying how they could never abort, the MAN on the microphone.

I started shaking, my heart beat faster. Finally I stormed up to the front, and asked if I could say something.

He was obviously hesitant, and finally got one of his accomplices to hold the microphone while I spoke; I guess he was scared I would run off with it?

""Have you ever had an abortion?"" I asked him.

""No.""

""We'll I have,"" I said in the microphone. ""I was young and not ready. I was preached abstinence and didn't know about birth control. I wasn't ready to bring a child into this already-overpopulated world. I aborted, and I'm here to say I'm FINE. I'm happy, I'm healthy, I'm beautiful. I work a great job and am in a fantastic relationship. I can't wait till the moment in the future when I AM ready to have a child. So I don't think you have any right whatsoever to speak about morality when you've NEVER had to make that decision.""

I walked away while he ridiculed me in front of the crowd. A few people tried to block my way, a few people shouted ""you don't LOOK happy"".

I guess I'm just looking for support. I just admitted to over 200 people that i had an abortion. It's been an hour and my adrenaline is pumping, I'm still on the verge of tears and I'm FURIOUS. I am all for freedom of speech, and I'm glad I live in a country where anyone can get on a microphone and preach whatever they want. 

Was I out of line?

Edit: wow, ladies, thank you so much. I went from feeling powerless and small to feeling like I did the right thing. Thank you so much for the reddit gold, whoever you are.

Also, as a disclaimer- I don't mean to sound like the fact that I live in San Francisco means there are no ignorant people, but most people think twice before protesting in front of planned parenthood, or making conservative political statements. Also, the fact that he was a man DOESN'T MEAN HE'S NOT ENTITLED to his opinion. But holding an opinion and preaching to a crowd about what I am supposed to do with a uterus he has never had is a bit different.


Edit2: I didn't post this to start a debate or get harassed via PM's. this is my main account and I'm afraid I need to make a new one. I have absolutely no desire to fuel an argument about the semantics of my speech- I had 30 seconds to spew out some feelings and tell my story in front of a lot of people. Sue me for not choosing the right choice of words on the spot.

The professor is a down-to-earth, no-nonsense sort of gentleman, extremely direct and frankly not too easy to like. After this though, he will probably in my top three most beloved teachers. Onto the story!

We were discussing various businesses concerning marketing and just general boring stuff when my Professor brings up Tampax. Not a big deal, everyone continues listening and jotting down notes. That's when I start to hear someone in the back making ""ugh"" noises and saying ""this is disgusting"" not so under his breath. I can feel my cheeks start to turn red. I'm thinking ""Why did he have to bring up this particular company?"" Turning to the girl next to me, I can see she's feeling the same way. 

That's when my Professor steps in. He calls on the young man in the back, asking if he had any issues or otherwise needed to say something. The kid goes ""Yea, this is gross and I don't see how it's relevant to anything"" Professor goes into full rage mode.

""You think this is GROSS?! and you don't see how it's RELEVANT to anything?! How about Tampax is a multimillion dollar company that provides a product that HALF of the human population NEEDS to live comfortably?! You don't want to make millions of dollars because you think this is GROSS?! You don't want to provide a product that makes life easier for women because you think it's gross!?""

He went on to say that the kid wouldn't make it anywhere if he didn't realize that women were a huge target market and that if he was that grossed out by women he should hope to work for an all male company. Which of course, isn't going to happen. 

It may not have been a huge gesture and I think it was more of a business savvy issue, but I'm really happy to have that man as my teacher.

I've worked tirelessly, with the end goal of graduating with minimal debt.

I graduate this December with less than 5,000 in loans. I've got about 2,000 in the bank right now.

For the first time in years I went shopping with more than a 100$ budget. I've had the same jeans since high school. Most of the t-shirts I own are deteriorating. All of my pajama pants are falling apart.

And I've never had a bra that fits me. Ever.

So, I splurged. I bought myself 170$ worth of new bras. They're gorgeous and fit like a glove -- I can't believe the difference.

I haven't replaced any of my other clothes yet, but I can't wait. I've never been much of a fashionista, but as soon as I pay off that 5,000 in loans, my wardrobe is going to get a much needed update.

Always willing to help around the house, helps with grandpa and grandma without a second though. Anyway, the other day mum was telling me he bought a girl home. I thought it was cool that he had a girlfriend and to be honest I was squealing on the inside with happiness. So I asked him about it.

""Who's your new girlfriend?""

""I don't have a girlfriend.""

""Oh, mum said you had a girl over the other day. Does she play vidya games?""

""Oh, nah. She's just a friend. Some guy was following her home and yelling out to her so I brought her back to our house to make sure she was safe.""

It might not sound like much, but this kid is my diamond in the rough. Our parents are sexist and racist red necks. I don't even know how he became such a champ. I told him I was so proud of him for sticking up for a young girl and being able to identify she was in trouble. He could have easily beat this other guy up (he does kick boxing) but instead he avoided conflict and just took her to shelter.

She said she had some boys clothes in her car she'd been meaning to give to a friend but they kept missing each other, and by looking at my son they'd probably fit him, so would I possibly want them?

I told her I am a single Mom so that it would actually be really helpful, I must have said thank you 1,000 times. She even carried the bag to my car so I wouldn't have to try to juggle my son and all of the stuff.

Even though I'm kinda struggling myself right now I try to help people around me in whatever way I can, so to go out today and have a total stranger do something so incredibly nice for *me* was a fantastic feeling, I will never forget her.

What happened: Dead asleep. Husband calls me to pick him up from work, since I have the car. Phone is under my pillow. Loudest. Ringtone. Ever. Wake up in a panic. Sit straight up. Reach for bat. Tampon torpedoes out of body followed by a freshly-undammed-geyser of blood. Panicking now, trying futilely to keep sheets from being ruined and fumbling for the phone in the dark with bat in hand. Hit face with bat in said panic. Abandon search for phone. Now running to the bathroom with blood all over  hands, bloody nose, and blood spewing from nethers. At this point I am wide awake and at the sink turning the knob, trying to rinse one hand to grab tampon while nose is flooding into the water. Being tilted this way makes my nose itch with the blood trickling out. Sneeze all over mirror. This makes more blood come from the ladybits.

A myth that gets floated around to young women to scare them and control them. ""If you get an abortion you'll spend the rest of your life regreting it and wondering about the child that could have been."" It's not new, or even origional. I hear it said all the time. And it really bothers me, beause 1. it implies that abortions are inately wrong and 2. that if you have one and don't feel ashamed there is something wrong with you. 

Let me tell you something a lot of people aren't going to like to hear. I don't regret it. I never think about it. I don't sit and cry wondering what my kid would have been like. I was 21, had just lost my father and I was in college. I knew that I'd never be able to take care of the child and that going to University pregnant wasn't something I was ready to do. So I had an abortion. I did what I knew was best for me. 

Please don't let people make you believe that an abortion will haunt you for the rest of your life. Please dont' let them force you by fear into something you don't want. 

**I don't regret it. And I'm not ashamed that I had an abortion**

**EDIT:** For clarification. I don't believe that all women will feel as I do. And there are some women that will regret their choice. Some may regret it but still feel it was the right choice. Some will feel it was the wrong one. No one should dictate your feelings to you or make you ashamed of them no matter what they are. 

By ""myth"" I meant the story that gets told to these women that ALL women regret it and spend their lives in an emotional black hole because of it. Will some: yes, I'm sure they do- and my heart goes out to you for the terrible pain you endure and especially if my post made you feel as if I discounted your feelings- I deeply appologize. 

From The_Bravinator: &gt;It's one of those things that can inspire a HUGE range of different feelings in different people, and whether you feel regret, relief, nothing at all or whatever else, it's all normal and it's all okay.

1337178776.0,1575,self.TwoXChromosomes,tpzi6,There's been a lot of support for the pretty ladies lately. How about a thread for us ugly sisters?,2788,1213,1015,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/tpzi6/theres_been_a_lot_of_support_for_the_pretty/,"Reppin' both sides of the coin, and whatnot.

Alrighty, so I'm a legitimate uggo; and not a case of 'oh, she just needs to learn how to groom herself' ugly, because I am a friggin' wizard with a flat iron. I'm a genuine, bona fide, certified, gold-star ugly gal. Lost the genetic lottery. Fell out of the ugly tree. Hit in the face with the ugly stick. I'm stressing this because I know how incredibly supportive this subreddit can be (""You're all beautiful! Everyone's beautiful! You're beautiful!""), but *ugly people do exist* and there are a lot of us, despite how drop-dead gorgeous we might be on the inside.

I guess I'm just wanting to vent a little, and maybe find some solidarity. I suppose what triggered this is the general nature of 2x posts - lately, we've seen a flurry of women coming out about the difficulties of being beautiful. There's always a lot of posts about not being able to move 2ft without being hit on, cat calls, handling friends who have fallen in love with you, being dumped my male friends when it's obvious you're not going to have sex with them, being dismissed as just a cute girl, etc, etc. I just want to say that this is *all completely alien to me*. Holy shit, you guys. I feel like I'm some sort of pretend, impostor girl because I seriously cannot relate at all.

So, to all the ladies with unfortunate visages: what kind of issues do you run into? How do you deal with this? Let's vent, share stories, advice, etc. Honestly, it's ridiculously hard to commiserate about this ever, because admitting to being ugly is such a gigantic taboo for a girl. Let's make this one of the rare opportunities to let some steam off.

To get us started, here are some of my issues:

**1)** Not being able to talk about it, or share experiences! It always instantly devolves into, ""Aww, I'm sure you're beautiful."" Being ugly is tough, especially for girls - looks are incredibly important. I need a place to vent.

**2)** Needing to try incredibly hard to be recognised academically or vocationally. I've been snubbed for awards that are *based on score*, in which I have the *highest score*, because the preferred recipient was an attractive lady.

**3)** Forming friendships. This can be hard, as so many people - especially guys - dismiss you right off the bat. People are hesitant to get to know an unattractive person.

**4)** Not being able to relate to other girls. For the luckier, less facially challenged folk in here: do you seriously deal with guys coming on to you multiple times a day? That's insane!

**5)** Wearing pretty outfits. Although I try to look presentable, I feel seriously awkward when I dress up - like I don't deserve to be wearing heels, or in a nice dress, because it's like putting lipstick on a pig. I know that's a pretty fucked mentality, but I'm in confession mode.

**6)** Dealing with beauty professionals who need to dance around the subject. For example, getting a haircut: ""Oh, you look so ... uh, trendy! With your new fringe."" Trying on a new outfit at a clothing store: ""That looks so... yeah!"" Awkwaaaard.

I try to deal with it by avoiding reflective surfaces (*hiiissssss!*), having a big personality, throwing myself into my research, trying to have a sense of humour about it, and crying into an unreasonably large burrito while watching *Daria*. I recommend the burrito.",,False,,t5_2r2jt,1337179228.0,,,True,t3_tpzi6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/tpzi6/theres_been_a_lot_of_support_for_the_pretty/,

This is what happened (warning, serious misogyny) ",2158,601,412,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/153zsg/told_my_conservative_muslim_mother_that_i_was/,"My mom's in town visiting me and a few days ago the subject of rape somehow came up when I was with my mother. She's very conservative and believes in no kind of physical contact (even hand shakes) before marriage. I asked her what she thought about rape victims, if they are Muslim, and if they should tell their future husband or not (I was testing the waters to see if I could tell her). 

Her response was ""well...that depends...if she, you know, lost something, she should tell him. But wait..they do have hymen reconstructive surgery, so she should do that"" 

I was shocked. My mom's conservative, but not so...ignorant. 

I said ""why? so she can pretend to be a virgin? a hymen means nothing anyway. even girls who haven't been raped or have sex sometimes don't have a hymen or don't even bleed. ""

She said ""yes but if she KNOWS she lost her virginity then she should have the surgery. Imagine how her husband will feel knowing that another man had his wife""

My response: ""So a rape victim should go through the distress and throw away thousands of dollars on a SURGERY just so her husband can have the sick satisfaction of knowing his wife bled on her wedding night? you don't care about how she feels? her healing isn't important, what's important is that her husband can have full dominance over her? and what guarantees that he's a virgin anyway?""

She got annoyed with me and said ""ugh, think about how the HUSBAND feels"" 

I couldn't stand the discussion so I told her I was disgusted and didn't want to talk about it anymore. 

This morning I was driving with her and she started talking about the CT shooting. She was saying that she watched Dr. Phil who featured the father of another school shooter. The father had said that his son was sexually assaulted before going on his shooting rampage, and had probably dealt with a lot of depression and emotional issues. 

She said ""he was probably raped by a teacher"" and I said ""or by another student"" and she said ""what? no. students wouldn't rape another male student, they only rape girls""

Of course I told her how incredibly wrong that is, that men and women get raped by their peers, or by older people, by anyone. She was shocked at the idea and said 'well girls get raped more because they dress slutty""

At this point I was fuming. And I admit I was raising my voice. I said ""What is wrong with you? What is with this backwards culture that you never left behind? A woman can dress how she wants, heck, even if she's walking naked down the street no one has the right to touch her""

And she said ""but she's inviting the rape! if you walk down the street with money in your hands and someone steals it, is  it the robber's fault or your fault?"" And I said ""It's the robbers fault!! No one has the right to hurt anyone, and it's never the fault of the victim""

She continued to talk but I just said ""please just stop., I don't wanna have this discussion at all""

I was so upset that I started crying. She asked me what was wrong and at this point I was bawling like a baby. I told her nothing, that I was just irritated and I needed to focus on driving. She asked ""purplejellybeans, did someone hurt you?"" 

I didn't answer her, and she kept asking, saying ""I need you to tell me so I can help you"" 

I said ""how are you going to help me? are you going to fund my hymen reconstructive surgery?""

And she kept asking ridiculous questions like ""what were the circumstances in which it happened? did it happen here or [our home state]? What were you doing when it happened? Please tell me"" 

Then finally ""What are you gonna do when you get married""

This is when I snapped ""WHO CARES?! SERIOUSLY WHO GIVES A SHIT? Does it fucking matter what I was doing, or where it happened? Does it benefit you at all to know? I didn't tell you because you're not interested in helping me. I'm trying to move on from this and look out for myself and you're only looking out for the pride of some future husband that may or may not exist!"" 

After that she said some things about how she wants to help me and I didn't respond and sat in silence the entire ride while she kept rubbing my hand. 

So anyway I'm really embarrassed that she knows now, and I know she's going to pry into my life and probably tell the rest of my family and continue to shame me for it. I'm at work right now and I'm dreading the thought of facing her later. 

Edit: Please be gentle on my mother. I love her, she's a sweet person, she was just raised with this mentality and doesn't know any better.

Wednesday, the boyfriend and I celebrated 10 years together. I wanted to go out and buy a cute dress to wear to dinner. Found a cute Jessica Simpson dress at TJ Maxx for under $20 that was sheer and green leopard print and a few others. 

Off to the dressing room I go, try on a few dresses but so far no luck. Nothing that is exactly what I am going for for the occasion but I still have hope. Take the JS dress of the hanger, notice it only has one button at the neck and no zippers but dont really think to much about it. It goes on easily enough but then panic sets in. I cant move my arms all the way anymore! There is a band at the bust line that is preventing me from laying my arms down or raising them all the way. 

Deep breath -- Okay lets try to wiggle out. Fucking boobs why must you be so unhelpful in the endeavor?! Okay that didnt work. Lets try pulling the arm through the sleeve and going over the head. AHHH! Throw a slight temper tantrum - that doesnt help either. Maybe I should just suck it up and rip the thing and then pay for it? The fabric is at least cute... 

Then I hear someone getting ready to leave in a dressing room down from me. Okay, buck up and just ask. We're all women. Theres nothing to hide and I'm sure I'm not the only one who has had this happen before. ""excuse miss? This is super embarrassing but can I get your help?"" We proceed to try 3 different ways before finally I am able to bend over and she can pull the dress of over my head with only bruising my shoulder and pride a bit. I AM FREE!!!! Well at least I had on cute panties for this ordeal... FML

So stranger, thank you so much for coming to the help of an embarrassed (puns completely meant) girl in the dressing room. You didnt judge me I hope and laughed it off with me the entire time. You could have ignored me, been a bitch, or showed me a complete look of distaste. But you didnt and I hope someday I can return the favor to someone who is also having a hard time shopping.

The moral of this story ladies: is actually a bit two part as pointed out by another lovely lady. 

1)Dont be afraid to ask a stranger for help! We have all had our embarrassing moments! And if someone asks you for help, try to not judge and understand it has probably already taken a huge amount of courage for them to turn to you for help. Dont try to knock them down more by being rude about it.

2)If all else fails, shop with friends LOL!",,False,,t5_2r2jt,1354992347.0,,,True,t3_14i0ze,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/14i0ze/to_the_stranger_in_the_tj_maxx_dressing_room/,

So many posts on this subreddit have the same underlying theme - anger and despair at being boxed in. And rightfully so. We are constantly told what we should be. On the front page right now is a smart woman, doing her job, who was insulted by some dummy who got mad and wanted to ""put her in her place."" Funny how often that happens, even in the subtlest of ways. 

You're fat? Well then you aren't sexy. 

You're skinny? Well having breasts makes you feminine. 

You're a stay at home mom? You're wasting your potential. 

You have a professional career? You're either a feminist or worse at your job than a man. 

You have big boobs? You're either fat or slutty. 

You wear heels? Only for the pleasure of men. 

You like baking? You're a disgrace to feminists. 

You're a lady lawyer? You must be a ball buster. 

You're walking down the street going to class? You're just asking for these lewd catcalls. 

I could go on all day. We are given a lot of grief for the ways in which we don't fit the mold according to our accuser. 

Lets collectively put our middle fingers up and tell the world that we wear many hats and if that threatens you....then be threatened. Because its not our job to soothe the fragile egos of those who are threatened by our abilities. 

I'm about to appeal a decision by a judge I think was very erroneous. I'm going to stand there in my heels and suit and minimal makeup and I'm going to argue the law with passion. I'm going to use my brain. I'm not going to be intimidated by the 30 year age gap of me and the opposing counsel. ...then I'll probably go home and bake something.

When we talked, I put some things together that I had never understood before, and learned some things that I think my fellow 2Xers should hear about. I know this is long, but I really hope some of you stick with it.  

My cousin is female and in her 30s. She’s tall and beautiful- *really* beautiful- and I’m a bit intimidated by her but she’s always been nice to me. She has chronically low self-esteem.  

As a kid she was naïve, but sweet and academically gifted. Her dad did a lot of hard core outdoorsy stuff and brought her with him. Even when she was really little, he just expected her to keep up. As a result, she was in in fabulous shape.  

During puberty she transformed into something ethereally beautiful. She was *stunning*. She stopped people dead in their tracks and left men tongue-tied. She could literally cause traffic accidents just by walking down the street. I’m starting to realize that she didn’t understand this. She didn’t have any idea how beautiful she was. She didn't try to be pretty, it was just something that happened to her. She didn’t have many friends and people generally weren’t very nice to her. It’s easy to see why.    

In high school she had two female friends. My cousin was two years behind me but we attended the same high school. I remember her friends. One was a lesbian who desperately hoped my cousin would turn out to be gay. The other was a childhood playmate who was viciously competitive. They eventually had a falling out and haven’t spoken in years.  

My cousin was sweet, naïve and trusting. She was always trying to help people and rooting for the underdog. Guys took advantage of her a lot- they manipulated her, used her, and broke her heart. Things didn’t get better in college. Two men she trusted- she’d been friends with them since the ninth grade- drugged her and raped her. I guess they subscribed to the “kindness coins =&gt; sex” theory of the friend zone and they figured they’d waited long enough for their reward. When that happened, she didn’t have anyone to turn to for support. (Her mom is out of the picture.) I didn’t find out about it until she and I talked a few days ago. She said I’m the only person besides her husband she’s ever told.  

Throughout her 20s, almost everyone who wasn’t trying to fuck her was intimidated by her beauty. People worked hard to make her look and feel stupid. It was like a game. I remember it happening at family gatherings and I’m ashamed to say I sometimes participated. It made people feel better. It made me feel better. I’ve struggled with my weight since I was a kid, and she was so pretty and skinny, with her long blond hair, smooth skin and big breasts. Tearing her down made me feel like she wasn’t so much *better* than me. And it made her self-esteem worse.  

My cousin is an emotionally ruined person and I didn’t even know it. She dropped out of college and married a morbidly obese man. I’m not sure if she did it because she was trying to prove something, or what. He’s nice enough to her. Maybe she married him because he just never stopped being nice to her. After they got married, she gained about 70 pounds in the span of five years.  

The crazy thing is, she says she’s happier today than she used to be. Now that she’s older and overweight, she makes friends more easily and she’s not so lonely. People have stopped using her for sex and to boost their own self-esteems.  

Like most other people, I’m not cruel to people just because they’re fat or because they have a hare lip. I consider myself a good person. But looking back, I know that sometimes I was cruel to my cousin. Because she was beautiful. Because she intimidated me. Because she made me feel fat and ugly just by standing next to me.  Everyone felt that way standing next to her, and no one wanted to be her friend. People were blinded by her looks and never saw the person behind the face.

Let’s all take a moment to remind ourselves that NO ONE chooses the face they’re born with. And we all need each other’s support to get through life. We women need to stick together. *All* of us.

Upon receiving it last night and opening it, I thought it was a little strange that the vibrator was packed pretty poorly in it's box, as it fell out with no effort, but thought nothing of it. As I tried turning it on, I realized it was defective as it only had power when plugged into it's charger. As I examined it closer to possibly see if I could see what was wrong with it, I realized that it looked a little......used. USED. My stomach dropped. I thought ""NO way would a company send someone a used sex toy, no fucking way."". I reluctantly looked a little closer to it and realized that there was what looked like dried body fluids in the seams of the vibrator!!! As I examined the package it came in, I noticed that it was ripped, and not from me taking it out. I also noticed that on a clear plastic part, where the vibrator sat in in it's package, it looked like some sort of fluid had been wiped off of it!! Seriously, WHAT THE FUCK?! I am in disgusted disbelief. What kind of company sends someone a fucking USED VIBRATOR?! Thankfully it came broken so I didn't use the damn thing! It's bad enough that my hands were all over it trying to figure out why it wouldn't work!! Ladies, do not ever order from Edensfantansy!!

I'm so proud!,2834,1335,448,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/yz5du/my_husband_got_in_the_face_of_an_upskirt/,"My husband and I were vending at a local anime con this weekend, and as everyone was packing up, we looked up to see a middle-aged guy take a photo of the backside of one of the other vendors as she was bending over her table. She wasn't in costume, just wearing a thin white skirt.

Five or six women, including the vendor, saw what happened. But as most of us here know, the disgust and shock of actually seeing it happen is paralyzing. Not for my husband, though! As quick as lightning, he ran around our table and right up to the guy, loudly (and rightfully) drawing everyone's attention to him.

My husband is one of the quiet types -- a real teddy bear. He never raises his voice or causes a fuss. But he was incredible. He stood there and berated the guy, pulled up to his full height, arms across his chest like a boss. The creeper withered under the scrutiny and hurried to delete the photos from his phone, all the while making explanations about how he 'just liked her costume' and 'was only taking a picture'.

By this time he'd attracted a lot of attention, and everyone else had snapped out of the shock and was getting in on yelling at the guy. The creeper practically ran out of the convention hall, burning with the shame of everyone standing up to him.

What makes it extra special is that we've been putting [these signs up at our table](http://chaoslindsay.tumblr.com/post/27660931079/costumes-are-not-consent-ill-be-posting-these) at all of our cons, and even succeeded in getting this particular con to put them up all over the venue, too!

It really gave both of us an entirely new perspective on women living in a world always conscious of body image.

“I suspect it’s difficult for men to imagine a world in which their bodies have long been inextricably linked to their value as an individual, and that no matter how encouraging your parents were or how many positive female role models you had or how self-confident you feel, there is an ever-present pressure that creeps in from all sides, whispering in your ear that you are your body and your body defines you. A world where, from the time of pubescence on, you can feel the constant and palpable weight of the male gaze, and not just from your male peers but from teachers and sports coaches and the fathers of the children you baby-sit, people you’re supposed to respect and trust and look up to, and that first realization that you are being looked at in that way is the beginning of a self-consciousness that you will be unable to shake for the rest of your life.Even if they are never verbalized, the rules of bodily conduct for females become clear early on: when school administrators reprimand you for the inch of midriff that shows when you lift your hands straight in the air or youth group leaders tell you that the sight of your unintentional cleavage is what causes godly young men to fall, you learn that your body is dangerous and shameful and that it’s your responsibility to cloister it in a way that is acceptable to everyone else. You learn that your body is a topic of public debate that everyone is entitled to weigh in on, from a male classmate telling you that those jeans make your ass look huge to the male-dominated United States Congress dictating the parameters that rape must fall within to be considered legitimate. To be a woman, and to live life in a woman’s body, is to be held to a set of comically paradoxical standards that make you constantly second-guess yourself and jump through a million hoops in pursuit of an impossible perfection.”

NSFW,2396,930,696,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12q0ta/bad_sex_bad_bad_sex_nsfw/,"I don't expect a lot of attention for this, I just had to share my awful sexcapade this weekend, and I can't tell any of my family or friends this, because I'm so ashamed of the whole ordeal. Some background is that I'm 23 and have only ever slept with three guys. I had a relationship with each guy before we even went to second base, and even though I'm pretty liberal-minded, I tend to be pretty conservative with my body. Also for the record, my last relationship ended ~6 months ago, so I haven't been sexually active.

If anything, I hope this story makes you laugh. And share in my shame.

Recently, I've made a friend, ""Jake,"" who I met at a bar when I was out with my girlfriends. My girlfriends kept telling me how cute he was, and I never meet guys like this, so I went ahead and gave him my number when he asked and then hung out with him a couple times. It turns out, this guy is BORING. He doesn't have a lot to say, besides, ""You're so cute,"" which I figured out what he says when he doesn't know what to say and I'm talking about how much I'm looking forward to The Hobbit coming out this winter. He's only interested in soccer and himself. The only substantial conversation we had was disastrous, when I found out he is a CONSPIRACY NUT who thinks we found alien life forms on the moon that gave us technology for Internet and cell phones and the government hushed it up. Ladies, I am not making this up. HE BELIEVES ALIENS LIVE ON THE MOON AND TAUGHT US HOW TO MAKE CELL PHONES. I don't know why I hung out with him after that, but I did. I guess I was hoping he would tell me more about how Harry Potter is a total rip off from LOTR because Gandalf and Dumbledore are the same person.

After a night of just him and me at a bar, he gets drunk, and starts pointing to me different women, saying, ""She's a slut...she's a slut...""  I got really offended, and said that was rude, and besides, how does he know they're ""sluts.""  His answer?  ""Because I've slept with them.""  Of course I told him, ""That means you're a slut."" He didn't get mad, but he got really sad. It turns out that he's a sad drunk. He asked me what I thought of him, and he was really sorry he was a slut, and he could tell that I wasn't one. I said it didn't matter that he slept with a lot of women, just that he degrades them afterwards for doing the same thing he did. The mini lesson in slut shaming didn't sink in, though. Fifteen minutes later he asks me on a date, and I said, in the biggest lie in the world, ""Oh, but I just want to remain friends."" Right now, I'm planning on never seeing this guy ever again.

The end of that night was bad enough. He got even more sad that I shot him down, then he drank some more, which made him even MORE sad, then he starts cuddling next to me and kissing my cheek and telling me I'm beautiful, which got really annoying, and then he whispers to me in his most seductive voice, ""I don't care that you friend zoned me. I'll still be your friend. But I'm gonna take you home tonight.""  NOPE. I made my excuses and ran.

That was five months ago.

He moved away suddenly, which only cemented in my mind the belief that he was only looking for a brief fling with me, because he didn't even tell me he was moving away soon while he was trying to ask me out. And I never heard from him again.

Until two weekends ago, when he came to visit.  ""Awkawrdsexcapade,"" he texts me, ""I'm in town. Want to get drinks?"" I was already getting drinks with my girlfriends again, so I agreed to meet him. He saw me at the bar for 5 minutes then left to visit other friends. I thought I handled the whole situation gracefully without hurting anyone's feelings. But then he came back this weekend, and texted me, and I had no plans. That's when I made the dumbest decision of my life. I decided, when he texted me, that I wanted to get laid in the easiest way possible.

This was stupid for many reasons. One is that I know that I'm STD free but I don't know that he is. That night he got drunk and sad and tried to seduce me, he assured me REPEATEDLY that he got regularly tested, was STD free, and kept condoms everywhere just in case. As if that was the reason I turned him down. Really, ladies, I don't know how I could possibly resist him. Also, I've never done a one night stand before, so I didn't know how to orient myself so I wouldn't end up in a compromising situation. Also, he would in the future point to me and call me a slut. Also, this guy is a dumbass. But I decided that I wanted to be ""that"" girl. I wanted to have carefree sex, just because I've been horny. I wanted to wham bam thank you ma'am to a boy that intended to do the same to me. Besides, he's slept with so many women, he's got to be good at it! My vagina won the ruling. (This guy really is cute. I'm an idiot.)

What followed next was awful for all of the above reasons and for one more. I WAS ABOUT TO EMBARK ON AN EVENING OF THE WORST SEX OF MY LIFE.

Let me skip the whole first part, with me putting up with him, with the shitty drinks, with the friend who accompanied us and then was conveniently left behind once he started to chat me up, with the inevitable proposal from Jake that I end the friendzone and give him another chance. He really really likes me, after all. Never mind that he never talks to me. Ever. He thinks I'm beautiful, and cute, and he called me princess once. I resisted the urge to get drunk to put myself out of the misery for the sake of sex and remained sober so I wouldn't do anything too stupid. (Hah!)

Finally, when we're walking around looking for another ""friend"" who maybe we would meet, he turns to me and kisses me. It was so sudden that I didn't even realize it was happening. Suddenly, lips on my cheek, then just as suddenly, on my mouth. I think, this isn't so bad. At least he's not - but then it sinks in. He's a bad kisser. He keeps making short, quick up and down movements with his lips, almost like he's chewing with his mouth partly open. I try to kiss back more to what I want, but it's not working. I'm really turned off. And then my vagina realizes something. This feel awful on my mouth, but would probably feel great, DOWN THERE. (You know what I mean.) I stick it out.

After a while, I don't mind the kissing so much. Did I mention, though, that I had a long day at work, and was tired? I asked him if we could ""hang out"" at wherever he's staying. He get's the hint immediately and says that we can go to his friends place. We walk back to our cars, but he stops and turns and pushes me against a wall and does that awful kissing thing again. Like fish lips. I'm sure he thought it was really romantic and spontaneous. But I push him off, and say, hey, let's get going, like I can't wait to bang him (which I can't.) But then he mentions that he's staying on the couch at a friend's place, and so we won't have any privacy. But then, he says we can go to a hotel, and we can just take his car, and he'll drop me off in the morning. I don't like this idea. I'm not willing to spend the cash or go into his car, but he says he'll pay for it. Whatever. I'll follow him in my car.

The reasons for us going in one car became obvious after five minutes when he starts spontaneously kissing me again (WTF? No wind up or anything?) and he whispers, again in what he thinks is an irresistable voice, ""Let's do it in your car."" Worst. Foreplay. Ever. My car is in the middle of a crowded parking lot, is filthy, and has untinted windows. No. ""Then let's do it in my car.""

Can I just stop the narrative here for a second, and point out how much I love that he refers to having sex as ""doing it."" Just like how we called it in seventh grade, ladies, and we were talking about walking in our older brothers doing it in the basement with their first girlfriends. And then we giggled.

Let's see if I can wrap this up more quickly: he escorts me to my car, then asks for a ride to his car, then asks me to get out for just a minute instead of me immediately following him to this phantom hotel that he won't give me the name of, then he's awkwardly kissing me, and I know what he really wants, but to test him I ask, ""So, are we leaving soon?"" and he says, ""Soon. But you're just so beautiful, I have to kiss you right now."" Finally, I push him away, and instead of saying, ""I'm leaving, go jerk off,"" I say, ""Fine. If the only way I'm getting laid tonight is by spreading my legs in the back of your car, then let's get it over with."" Every other guy I've ever been with would have been wounded by my rudeness. He was happy. Of course. He's in charge of the wham bam, apparently.

The good news, is that he does have condoms, so I don't have to waste any of mine. I tell him that wearing a condom is one of my conditions. The other is that he eats me out. I haven't had good cunnilingus since my first boyfriend five years ago, ladies, and I have been eager to have another. He agrees. And so kisses me in the back of his car (in a secluded parking lot with tinted windows) saying to me such sexy things like, ""Tell me you like me,"" and ""Is it sexy that you can feel my boner."" He's even dropped the tired, ""You're so cute,"" and now the dirty talk is all about him. Just put on the condom already!

He does, and then he goes down on me, and that's what I've been looking forward to all night. He licks me twice, across the whole of my vagina, really only across the outer labia, so lightly there isn't any pressure at all, looks up at me and asks, ""Does that feel good?"" When I look at him in disbelief, he does it again, and then asks, ""Do you like that?"" When I dont' answer, he says, ""You know, I've never done this with a girl before, but for you, you're so beautiful I'll do anything for you.""  I thought he's been with a lot of women. ""I have."" Haven't any of them given him a blow job. ""Of course.""

I'm so tired at this point, and my wham bam isn't going how I planned, and I don't have the energy to educate the poor fool on clitoral stimulation with the lips and tongue, who is clearly resistant to the idea. I grumpily ask him why he didn't just tell me that he wasn't comfortable with oral sex. And I push him back on the seat, sit on top of him, and figure I'll work the rest out for myself. And thank god I orgasm, because then I figure he'll finish up, and I can go home.

Only, he doesn't finish right away. He keeps moving me around the backseat, in the missionary position every time, and continues fucking me, which, for him, means alternatively banging me as hard as he can, and when he gets tired, swirling it around slowly inside me. We're alternating between *ow ow ow* and then, ok, now I feel the presence of your dick inside of me and am receiving no sexual satisfaction at all from it. This is how he keeps his stamina up, and then he moves me around, and this time my neck is bent out of shape, and I have say his name several times before he stops and I point out that my head is at a 90 degree angle perpendicular to my body. Eventually, I give up and lay limp and hope that he finishes soon.

LADIES, I HAVE NEVER ROLLED MY EYES AS OFTEN AS I DID WHILE HE WAS PERFORMING THE HORRIBLY AWFUL SEX TO MY BODY.

Oh, and I forgot about the kissing. It got progressively worse. He would just press his face against mine whilst humping me, sucking vigorously on whatever the lips happened to clamp on to. If it was on my actual mouth, I could barely breathe. I think the eye rolling helped circulate some of the depleting oxygen in my brain.

Finally he stops. Not because he is actually finished, but so he can take a break before we continue to ""Do it all night long."" Oh hell no, I've got work in the morning. Say what you want about the man's sexual technique, but he clearly has stamina, and I was not willing to see how long it was going to last.

But then he looks at me weird and asks if I'm ok. I'm worried that my eyes are trapped at the back of my skull. I tell him that I'm very tired and that I suddenly wasn't feeling well, both of which were true statements. He reluctantly asks if I want to leave, and I immediately respond that I think that would be a good idea. He says ok, but clearly he wants to make a last attempt to complete my seduction, so he kisses me again (shudder) and starts poking his fingers around my vagina in an attempt to stimulate me back into having pounding, swirling sex with him. I don't think the man has heard of a clitoris, ever.

But I apologize, put on my pants, he does the same and follows me out, and I have to endure one more goodnight kiss before I pull away in my car and peel off.

The point is, ladies (and presumably gentlemen) of Reddit, I learned a valuable lesson. In the worst case scenario I contracted HPV, will get cancer, and die. But really, I think that I just learned that I'm not the wham bam, type. I think that I'll just stick to my vibrator from now on when I have sexual urges. That one little orgasm was not enough to make up for the worst sex ever. Most of these anecdotes on 2XC end with an invitation to share similar experiences, I suppose to keep the subReddit from becoming LiveJournal, so by all means, share if you have had a worst experience then me. I just wanted to tell SOMEBODY, and hopefully I brightened someone's day or night as they read the hilarious retelling and thanked their lucky stars that they weren't me last Friday night.

TL;DR Had awful one night stand sex with a slightly misogynistic sports idiot. Really, if you have the time, I suggest you read the novella I wrote just for entertainment value.

EDIT TO COVER COMMENTS IN GENERAL, SO I DON'T HAVE TO INDIVIDUALLY REMARK ON EACH ONE:

1) Thanks for the other awful horror stories. Here's a shout out to my new favorite person on the Internet, rawrzez, for her even worse dirty talk experience of ""Lick you like Jesus."" My sides hurt.
2) I KNOW I did this to myself. I know that in embarking on this voyage I have provided positive reinforcement for this bad sex asshole. I really don't care, though. Whether or not I slept with him wasn't going to change his lifestyle, I figured. I wanted only to use him.
3) Why him? Because I wanted to use him. I don't know very many guys. All the rest of them are nice, and wouldn't be down for a one night stand. I value my friendship with all other guys. I don't really appreciate this guy as a human being, and he's the only one I could guarantee would not try to create a relationship out of it. He hasn't contacted me since. At least that part of my plan worked out.
4) I so deserve it. I have never deserved anything so much in my life. This is karma on a steaming platter served in the luxury compartment of the karma train.
5) Most importantly, IF YOU LIVE IN THE US, DO YOUR RESEARCH AND VOTE TODAY. :)",,True,,t5_2r2jt,1352240829.0,,,True,t3_12q0ta,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12q0ta/bad_sex_bad_bad_sex_nsfw/,

Ladies and gentlemen of /r/twoxchromosomes... I TAPPED THAT. AW. YES. It was awesome. I request the highest of fives. I've never came with a guy before- 3 times mothafuckas.

**UPDATE TO THE UPDATE:** Sorry to be so late in details, ladies. I was at it again. Just got home. We had been flirting back-and-forth all day, he had me up in those hugs (if that's what you can call it. Definitely not your average Christian side-hugs) I mentioned in the last post. Anyway, he actually came to the student union in hopes that I'd be there. Which is the same reason I was there. So we talked, flirted, ""hugged"", etc all day. 

I fully intended on being the one to initiate the sex stuff, but he beat me to it. He asked if I wanted to go to his place, and I enthusiastically agreed. We sat on his bed to ""watch futurama"" (a mutual favorite show of ours) but we literally didn't make it past the two minute marker. IT WAS AWESOME. We fucked from 2:30 to 4:30- I thought I had class at four but I couldn't stop, it was too good. It didn't end up being until 5 and ended at 9 (scuba diving, pool session), and he offered to let me study at his place (I hate studying at home). I knew I wouldn't get anything done but I went anyway. Fucked from around 10-12. My legs are quivering, my lady bits are like ""whoa"", I was hardly able to drive home. 

Sorry-- I was in the middle of writing that at 2a and I fell asleep with my phone in hand.

EDIT: I feel I should add- there's a lot of people saying I only fucked him because he sounds like James Deen. I fucked him because I was attracted to him. I started out as just friends. He was just a friend in my perspective- I enjoy his company, he's smart, good-looking, gives great hugs. Eventually I started being attracted to him as more than a friend. And then we fucked.

1369532162.0,1461,self.TwoXChromosomes,1f25v5,First week at new job in the tech industry. Braced myself to deal with sexism. And here's what I had to deal with:,2082,621,292,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1f25v5/first_week_at_new_job_in_the_tech_industry_braced/,"*Nothing*.

I'm a girl in the middle of an engineering degree at a top 10 university.  Everything I've read, everyone I've talked to, everything I expected based on the guys I've dealt with in my classes- everything lead me to believe that entering the workforce, I'd encounter sexism, in forms ranging from really blatant to the things being documented at the Everyday Sexism Project.  I resolved a while ago to do what I could to stop it, but had mostly resigned myself to figuring out a way to deal with it.  I really wanted to be an engineer, and sexism seemed to be something that came with a tech career.

So I was nervous when my boss introduced me to the group I'd be working with this summer, because I was *literally* the only girl working with the group.

Ladies, I couldn't be working with a more welcoming and accepting group.  I'm four days in and I've already been given some useful projects to complete (it isn't mind-numbing intern photocopying work!)  I was told, by three separate people, that they'd be more than willing to make themselves available if I needed advice or someone to bounce ideas off of, but that they knew I'd be able to handle the tasks on my own.  In meetings, they ask my opinion, and they stop to explain anything I might not know (lots of acronyms, mostly).  I feel young and inexperienced, but I don't feel conspicuously female.  I feel like an engineer, and it's because they're treating me as one.

I mostly wanted to share because I see a lot of sexist interactions documented by people on this sub- and of course, I get angry and indignant on any such poster's behalf.  It's important to call such interactions out.  But I'm just so happy and so relieved that I lucked out by joining an amazing team for the summer that I wanted to shout my elation from the rooftops!",,False,,t5_2r2jt,False,,,True,t3_1f25v5,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1f25v5/first_week_at_new_job_in_the_tech_industry_braced/,

[trigger warning]",2120,659,440,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1bavbs/i_escorted_at_a_clinic_this_morning_and_it_was_so/,"Apparently the Saturday before Easter is a big day for the anti-abortion protestors (second only to the day before Mother's Day), so the escort group put out a call for extra volunteers this morning.  My husband and I are very pro-choice, and decided to put our values into action by volunteering as escorts.  The email said that you were expected to not engage/argue with the protesters and I figured I could handle it.  Just a bunch of people holding signs and possibly yelling, right?

This clinic, unfortunately, does not have its own parking lot, making it a dangerous experience for clients to just make it to the front door.  Clients have to park on the street and walk down the sidewalk, or park across the street.  So that gives the protesters a lot of freedom to be pushy and obnoxious.  Today they arrived in swarms, lining up with their rosaries and signs and big flags with the Virgin Mary, and their pamphlets, and their anger.  It's one of only two clinics in the state, and some women have to drive hours just to get here.

My husband and I were given clinic escort vests and a brief rundown - ask people if they want to be escorted, walk at their speed, don't engage with the protesters, don't touch the protesters (or they'll cry ""assault!""), keep talking even if it's just about the weather, to just keep the client's attention away from the screaming.

Our first client, man and woman, arrived and parked, waited in their car until we got the go-ahead that the clinic was open.  Escorts in our bright vests far outnumbered the protesters, but the protesters were determined to make up for it with volume and vitriol.  She said that she just wanted to jaywalk, and go in as fast as possible.  She had a sweatshirt on, with her hood pulled up.  As we crossed the road, the screaming intensified.  People were EVERYWHERE, a chaotic frenzy of escorts and protesters.  One short woman was suddenly in my face, bumped into me, trying to reach the client.  Screaming about murder, and don't do it, and go to the ""real clinic"" (referring to the fake clinic just next door).  The client screamed back.  And then reached the door, and made it inside.  

As my husband and I walked back across the street to the parking lot to wait for the next client, I started to get choked up - I hadn't realized it was going to be so intense.  The raw emotion - the screaming of the protesters over the sound of people praying, feeling the raw intensity from the client, having people angrily bumping into each other and just, the raw emotion.  

We ended up escorting one more woman, and then it was done.  I turned in my vest, thanked the other volunteers, got to my car, and started to cry.  It all seems so distant when you read about it on TwoX - I've read stories from women who have gotten abortions.  My heart has broken for them from reading their stories.  But actually standing next to someone and being completely unable to shelter them from the pure hatred (I messed up, too - in the heat of the moment as one particularly hostile protester was screaming and waving pamphlets, I put my arm around the client and later got scolded by one of the head volunteers, and rightfully so!, who reminded me that everything about this experience should be under the client's control...I felt so awful about it, messing up during a time of such incredible importance)...being unable to just push those stupid protesters right on their asses - all I wanted to do was just SCREAM back at them to get the hell out of the way, to keep all of their awful words and awful signs and awful faces from even reaching those clients.  I felt helpless and overwhelmed.  And utterly **humbled** when I realized that my feelings of helplessness and other emotions were just a fraction of what those clients must feel.  I can't even fathom what emotions they feel as they make this decision.  I was in awe of their strength, and truly humbled.  

As I sat in my car and cried, all I could think of was those two women.  I don't know their names, I don't know their stories, but I will always remember them.

I was sitting in the chair, thinking about how long my thick hair must take for them to cut and dry and wondering if they are frustrated with thick hair - especially on days when they are in a hurry.  Before I could say anything, I heard these things uttered by women in surrounding chairs (each talking to their respective stylists):

Lady 1:  I'm sorry my hair is so long. *nervous laugh*

Lady 2:  I'm sorry my hair is so thin...Its hard to work with.

Lady 3:  I'm sorry its so curly.  Is it a problem?

Just as I was about to apologize for my hair being too thick (which I often do - I want to acknowledge that it takes time and I'm a bit embarrassed when they run their hands through it and remark ""wow its so thick!"" without the tone of a compliment attached to it).  I realized all of us had just apologized for things we could not help, in a place where they are *supposed* to be working on our hair.  There is no shame in thin hair, curly hair, long hair, thick hair.  What hair are we supposed to have before we enter the salon?  Perfect hair?  What about when we leave?  Should it be perfect then?  Perfect according to whom?

I just wanted to remind you (as I have to remind myself) that maybe some of us, inherent in our personality, like to be pleasing, accommodating, easy to get along with - and naturally go out of our way to do so.  Perhaps we do that too much.  Perhaps when we apologize for something like the thickness of our hair, we are internally acknowledging that that is a problem.  But it isn't.  It isn't a problem.  Hair is not a *problem.*  

For goodness sake.  At some point - whether the conversation is about body size, or skin type, or jobs, or money, or babies, or relationships, we can kind of beat ourselves up.  Maybe today (on this FRIDAY) we can agree to give ourselves a small break from it all?  

So, in a moment of rebellion, I said nothing.  I did not apologize for my thick hair.  I just sat there, enjoyed the cut and style, paid and left.  As it should be.  Because if my stylist came into my office looking for my help, I would not expect her to apologize and say ""I'm sorry I have this problem.""  Stop being sorry.  Let me do my job.

Any epiphanies from you TwoX ladies lately?  I absolutely love ""realization"" threads.  I think they bring us together as a community because of the wide range of opinions it attracts.

I went to see a Perinatologist yesterday to find out what's really going on and get a clearer picture. 

She's actually missing her vermice and the right half of her cerebellum. I have to get an MRI this Friday, talk to a specialist about the findings, get another ultrasound and then decide what to do with the baby. 

I can't believe I am being faced with this choice. I've joined a group of parents on FB with children who have problems with their cerebellum. It was pretty eye-opening and grim. Many of these children can't walk, can't talk, and are extremely developmentally delayed. They celebrate the little accomplishments.

1358393763.0,1432,self.TwoXChromosomes,16qaup,Dustin Hoffman's experience as described on NPR this morning...,1970,538,456,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/16qaup/dustin_hoffmans_experience_as_described_on_npr/,"This morning I was listening to NPR while I was driving. Dustin Hoffman was being interviewed and the discussion in that moment was about the making of Tootsie, where he dressed as a female character, ""Dorothy Michaels."" What he said caught my attention so much that I went back and transcribed that specific portion myself...because it rang so true to me:  


""I looked like a woman... I wanted to be able to fool the average person in the audience... A crew member came up to me and said, 'I brought a friend of mine, can I introduce him to you as your character Dorothy Michaels- see if we can fool him?' and I said, 'Sure, go ahead.' And he brought the guy over and the guy didn't know anything about the movie... and he looked me up and down in such a, in such a blunt, painful way. I felt like it was a venetian blind, ya know? He just shut the blind and looked and said, 'Where's Jessica Lange?' And that happened. Guys started to- crew started to do that with their friends and I said to my wife after a few times, I said, 'I cannot believe that men,' and I included myself, 'could be that callous and in a sense erase a human being who didn't fulfill their ideas of what 'attractive' is. And my wife said to me, I remember it in that conversation, she says, 'What do you mean?' I said, 'Well, if I had met myself at a party I wouldn't have come up to me and I think I'm a very interesting woman.' And I got emotional at that moment. ""  

**Edit:** I should have posted a link to the recording. [Here](http://rdd.me/sw5fogau) it is. Thanks Naynay31 for posting it on here first. I believe it was said at about the 36 minute mark. Also, I'd like to add that I do believe people in general do this. I'm not trying to say all men are guilty of this and that the reverse hasn't been done by women. However, I think it's more of a norm in our society to overlook a behavior similar to this experience if the person doing the glancing and disregarding another individual is a male, and I think it's more prevalent in that way.   

With that being said, bashing the male gender was not my intention with this post. My intention was sharing how touched I felt that some light had been shed on at least one individual what is a common feeling for many women. It's something I face daily, especially since I'm bigger as well. I figure it's relatable to members of this sub and it was touching and heartwarming to know that someone's eyes have been opened to something he wouldn't have previously thought about.

1366576955.0,1431,self.TwoXChromosomes,1cti9d,I had a momentous realization -- I'm not a woman!,2259,828,327,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1cti9d/i_had_a_momentous_realization_im_not_a_woman/,"My whole life I have struggled with this strange sensation that I didn't quite...fit. As a kid I never felt like a girl. I was tomboyish and loud-mouthed, I had no sense of fashion and never thought that much about how I looked. When I hit puberty I went from being an absolutely tiny little girl to a not very tiny, rough around the edges middle schooler. In high school I looked at my female classmates and saw girls. When I looked at myself in the mirror, I didn't see a girl. I just saw myself. I tried to imitate my classmates in hopes of becoming a real girl. I put on dresses and heels, wore makeup and carried handbags. And yet, even with all the elements there, I still didn't feel right. I felt like some strange caricature of a girl, a doll dressed in the wrong clothes. It was just that I wasn't doing the right things, but that I didn't even think like a girl. I remember hanging out with a friend once, who began talking about buffing and growing out her fingernails. I realized two things -- that I didn't care about how shiny my nails were, and that *it had never even occurred to me* to care. I felt like there was something wrong with me for not even realizing that I was supposed to be ""taking care of"" my nails.

In college I became more comfortable with myself. I developed enough of a sense of style so that I didn't look awkward, although I still don't really have any fashion sense. I learned how to wear makeup in a way that is natural and non-time consuming. I painted my nails occasionally, just because I wanted to.

And yet...there was still something wrong. There was still this very deeply-etched sensation that while I was female, I was not a woman. A couple of days ago this sensation returned to me in full force when my male roommate insisted on showing me one of his favorite country music videos -- [Kip Moore's Somethin' Bout a Truck](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YfNFR6gh2E). The video pretty much centers around a beautiful woman in a little red dress and cowboy boots, who apparently wants nothing more than to hang out with him and his pickup truck. My roommate said, and I quote, ""I need to move to the South and find a woman like that."" I literally laughed out loud and said, ""that's not a woman. That's just men's idea of one.""

As soon as the words left my mouth it hit me straight in the gut. All these years I've been thinking of women as a defined idea. I've been thinking that there is actually a set of qualifications to being a woman. That you must meet X, Y, and Z specifications to be a woman. I have been thinking that I'm meant to be a woman, yet am failing to be one.

I realized that I am not a woman. I'm a person. If you wanted to break down my qualities as ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" you might be able to, but who really cares? I'm biologically female, and beyond that I don't give a fuck and neither should anyone else.

I've heard about and read about the effort to get rid of gender norms for years, but I don't think I've ever really understood it until now.

EDIT: Wow, thanks for all the responses. You people are awesome! To clear up a few things....

I identify both as female and as a woman. I've realized that I can be a woman and have traits that are not typically associated with women. It's okay to be practically-minded, emotionally reserved, unfashionable. These are my traits, and they are part of my womanhood. In essence, you define what woman you are, not the other way around. I actually find it incredibly empowering. Even as I've realized that what I've spent my life thinking about the word ""woman"" wrong, I now feel more like a woman than I ever did. Because I've realized that I'm a person first, and everything that comes from that defines what kind of woman I am.

With the country music video, I don't take issue to the idea of the woman in a the red dress. I think it's wonderful that there are women like that who want to enjoy trucks, beer, and men. My issue was with the way the video was set up and the audience it's trying to reach. This video is 100% an advertisement to men, saying ""this is the life you want -- pickup trucks and girls."" The woman in the video seems to be as equally important to the scene as the truck and the beer. She is part of this man's fantasy world. She doesn't even get a name. This same exact scene in real life would be great because it would feature a real man and a real woman just doing their thing.

I talked to my Mom about this, and she said, ""Langlie, I knew from the time you were a baby that you were going to do your own thing, everyone else be damned. I tried to dress you up like a cute little girl and you wouldn't have any of it. So I stopped trying."" She sent me [this](http://imgur.com/94Dk3H8) picture of me at five.

While the narrator's experience is not exactly my own, I think it echoes what a lot of women on the internet have experienced on Reddit and other forum sites.**

How to Be a Girl on the Internet



To be a girl on the Internet, you can’t be a girl on the Internet. You don’t yet know this when you first start browsing, laughing at the funny memes and cat pictures that people post on Facebook. Wonder where these pictures come from. Click on the links. Sign up on Tumblr and Pinterest. Here most of the users will be girls, and proud of it. Follow your friends and blogs that post gifs of scenes and quotes from your favorite movies. See a link someone reblogs that directs you to a forum post on a different site, one with a huge userbase, mostly men. You are fine with this, since you’ve always felt yourself to be “one of the guys” instead of “one of the girls.” Read the whole thread and laugh at how funny the users are. Decide to create an account.



Stare at the empty blank box for “username.” You will have several usernames that you use on different sites, but none of them are quite right for this site. Shut your laptop and decide to come back to it later. In the shower, while you’re furiously scrubbing your scalp with Garnier Fructis, you’ll have an epiphany. Towel off and immediately return to your laptop screen. Be impressed by your own wit as you type in “MissEllaneous.” This username is taken. “Miss_Ellaneous.” This username is taken. “Miss.Ellaneous.” This username is taken. “MrsEllenaous.” This username is available.



After several weeks of lurking, build up the courage to finally make a comment on a post about hiking. The first reply is “I didn’t know they had trails in the kitchen.” Find it funny—after all, it’s just making fun of gender norms. Another girl replies to the comment telling him off. Tell yourself she’s just uptight and can’t take a joke. Find it less funny after another one of these comments appears under an insightful post in the politics forum that you took ten minutes to type out. No one ever replies to the actual content of your comment. Delete your account and choose another one, this time with a more gender ambiguous name—no words like “princess,” “girl,” “lady” or “Mrs” to identify you.



When you post a picture of yourself in a nerdy Doctor Who sweater you knit, learn that any female body part at all—hand, leg, foot, shoulder—will be sexualized. Strangers will feel obligated to inform you whether or not they’d “hit it.” Ignore them when they search your post history for nudes, and, when they don’t find any, ask for them. The other half of the comments will call you an attention whore and tell you not to expect special treatment just because you’re a girl. Decide not to post any more pictures with yourself in them.



Feel creeped out by the disturbing messages people start to send you. Don’t click on the attached link named “my penis.” When, out of pure curiosity, you do anyway, feel disgusted and immediately close out of your browser. Wonder if that makes you a lesbian. Don’t reply to any of them. Start locking your doors and windows at night. Switch accounts when they still don’t stop.



Stumble in a thread about rape. Be appalled when the other commenters tell rapists who write their stories that they aren’t rapists and that the girls wanted it. Read several more pages of comments before turning away from your computer in disgust. Do people really think false accusations of rape are more common than true ones? Don’t trust any of their statistics—they probably pulled them from their asses. Make it a rule to not open any threads that even look like they could lead to more rape discussions.



Correct someone who refers to you as “he.” Get called a “politically correct feminazi.” Google “feminazi.” Wikipedia will tell you it’s “a radical or militant feminist, perceived to be intolerant of opposing views.” Argue with them that you’re just a feminist, that all you want is equal rights and for people to call you by the right gender. Be told that feminists don’t really want to be equal to men, but superior to them. Get into an argument for the next hour. Even when you leave your computer, the words will stick to your brain like syrup. Realize that you’re voluntarily spending your free time getting angry and frustrated. Stop correcting people.



Figure out the forums where it’s safe to be a girl. Stick only to these parts of the site. Most likely they will be forums for women, most of the users outspoken feminists. Feel comforted that you finally found a place where people agree with you and are equally appalled by the things they read online. Learn terms like “sex-shaming,” “body acceptance” and “cis-gendered.” Slip them into conversation with your friends at lunch one day, ignoring their confused looks. Tell yourself they are just a product of “rape culture” and need to check their privilege—they couldn’t possibly understand these kinds of progressive ideas.



Avoid the most popular, heavily trafficked areas of the site. The more people there are, the more misogyny there is. Notice that you encounter more sexism in five minutes online than years in real life. If the anonymity of the internet allows people to speak their minds, are these opinions ones that most people carry? Become suspicious of everyone around you; wonder what they’re like behind their online personas. Feel yourself losing a little faith in humanity. Wonder if you are really becoming a feminazi.

1373504673.0,1397,self.TwoXChromosomes,1i1rml,Was treated poorly at the gym...sent the following email of complaint. Is this normal personal trainer behavior?,1924,527,445,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1i1rml/was_treated_poorly_at_the_gymsent_the_following/,"I am writing to express my disappointment in the professional conduct of the head personal trainer at the Gym's Northwest location. 


I was happy to accept an offer for a free personal training session earlier last week, as I have been thinking about signing up for several training sessions.


During the session, I expressed the following to my trainer: My workout routine currently consists of running between 8-15 miles/week, 1-2 pilates classes at BX, 1 day cardio at Gym, and 1 day of strength training at Gym. I am not interested in losing any weight (BMI 21, healthy weight for my height, body fat at 21% - low end of normal range for women), but would like to improve my strength training routine and work on toning a bit more. I mentioned that my wedding is coming up in 4 months, and reiterated multiple times that I have no interest in losing any weight and never once expressed dissatisfaction with my personal appearance. 


After the session, the trainer brought me into a room to discuss my diet with me, and then the head trainer came in to discuss purchasing training. Up until this point, I was happy with my training session. However, after the head trainer came in, I the session turned into an attempt to degrade me and make me feel as though I needed to lose weight and am out of shape. Multiple comments were made regarding needing to 'look good in my wedding dress', 'get in shape for the wedding', 'only four months to look good for your wedding day', etc...These types of comments are unacceptable as they are both a) an attempt to sell training based on perceived body insecurity in women and b) completely off-base based on my own comments during the intake session. I work out very consistently, am very happy with how I look in my wedding dress; I am appalled that behavior/style of hard sell is accepted and tolerated at your gym. Attempting to degrade me into feeling bad about how I might look in my wedding dress is a deplorable manner in which to sell your gym's services.  


To add insult to injury, when I stated I would need to speak to my fiance prior to purchasing any training sessions, I was asked by your head trainer if I 'needed to speak to the Wallet.'  This type of language is extremely sexist and completely inappropriate. I hold a full-time, well-paying position, and would feel equally offended even if I did not. The high cost of personal training is naturally cause for discussion between my partner and me and has nothing to do with who earns the money. 


I came into my personal training session with the intent on spending up to $400 for Gym's personal training services. However, based on my experience, I will not be spending any money on training at the gym. Had an attempt been made to listen to me and sell me training sessions based on the goals mentioned at the beginning of my session, perhaps I would feel differently. 



Update: I received a sincere apology from the manager at that Gym's location. He apologized several times and has documented the trainer's performance. I am happy I spoke up. It was interesting going through everyone's comments, I am happy to hear that this is not the standard for a good trainer, but am sorry to read that many of you have had similar experiences.

usernames, one obviously male and one obviously 
female. I noticed that there is much more hostility 
towards women on here and I really like my male 
account better because my opinions are respected 
more. ",2563,1183,1097,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/skl1z/i_have_been_experimenting_on_reddit_with/,"I noticed after two months as my female username I was constantly having to defend my opinions. I mean constantly. I would post something lighthearted, and have people commenting taking my comment literally and telling me I was dumb or I didn't understand xyz. People were so eager to talk incredibly rudely and condescendingly to me. People were downright hateful and it made me consider leaving. 

Then I decided to experiment with usernames and came up with an obviously male name. While people still disagreed with me which is to be expected, I had more people come to my defense when I had a different opinion and absolutely no hateful or condescending comments. I am completely shocked at how different I am treated since having a male username. I am not saying Reddit is sexist, well kind of yes, but I think it's really interesting and thought that some other girls on here would want to get male usernames and see the difference for themselves. 

Edit: Wow the response is overwhelming. I am glad I am not the only one dealing with this. One thing, I am not claiming this to be scientific by any means. This started as a personal thing I was curious about. I don't want to let out my names just yet because I am only a month deep into my male identity. 

EDIT 2: Okay to answer some questions I have been getting. 

* I am making a judgment mostly based on the kind of comments I was getting -- not really upvote/downvote type of stuff.

* I also do not post in these subreddits where it seems to be more gender neutral -- I am posting on politics, science articles, and humorous stuff. Some of it is lighthearted and some of it is serious.  

* The names I used were not feminine or masculine, they were directly indicating sex like ""aguywho"" or ""aladythat."" There was no assuming gender as the name was very clear -- I think this is important.

* I also want to reiterate that the comments I get are along the lines of being talked down to. My opinion as a male was much more accepted despite my tendency to play devil's advocate. While met with downvotes at times, I had almost no comments ""correcting"" me or putting me in my place. As a woman with an alternative view, this was almost never the case.  

* Another thing, I would like anyone who thinks that I am wrong to post as an obviously female/male poster just for a week. Just post your regular comments and see what happens. It takes almost no work and really gives you another perspective to think about.

Unfortunately the lecturer also spoke of rape in the Middle Ages and how to kill yourself following rape was a way to protect your virtue. This proved too much for me and I had to leave the room.

   After lectures, we have a tutorial with about 15 people. I was feeling really bummed out because of the lecture, but we got onto the topic of misogyny, and I wanted to know if my tutor felt like we were moving backward in the development of women's rights and feminism. I mean, before this election I had never heard politicians speak of such appalling things as ""legitimate rape"" or prison sentences for women who seek abortion etc. But it was my tutor's response that really put things in perspective. She said: ""we're not moving backward at all. These are just the shrieks of dying dinosaurs who know their era is dead.""

   So the next time I'm attacked on reddit for believing in women's rights, or daring to say kitchen jokes aren't bloody funny, I'm going to try to tell myself, that these people know they are wrong. They're just desperately clinging to crazy ideals to try to stretch out the time they have left for ignorance and intolerance. Because as my lovely tutor said ""The world isn't getting anymore old-white-mannish"".

I don’t see a need to hide myself.  I’m sure H will read this at some point.  I just don’t give a shit.

WARNING:  I have a lot to get off my chest.  I’m also not very good at formatting.  Please try to keep the grammar police at bay.

On April 19th, my husband was arrested for “patron prostitute.”  That means that he hired a prostitute (or someone he believed to be a prostitute) for sex.  I learned he was in jail while I was calling hospitals trying to find him because I knew something was wrong.  I saw that he had been home because he brought me flowers, but I hadn’t heard from him.  The person who called me and told me he was in jail wasn’t calling me to let me know he was in jail, he was calling to verify information so that the husband could be released on his own recognizance.  I asked him why H had been arrested, and he said “lewd acts” which could be anything from pissing in public to something sexual.  Ok…  At that point, I still gave H the benefit of the doubt and planned on picking him up in a couple of hours from jail.  I knew he was safe, so I went over to a friend’s house for a beer and to relax before I had to pick H up.  The idea of “lewd acts” kept bothering me, and I decided to see if there was more information about the arrest online.  That’s when I saw exactly what he was arrested for, and my heart felt like it had been ripped out of my chest.  Needless to say, I did not pick H up from jail.  

Before you ask, yes, I did get an STD and HIV test.  It was negative.  I have to go back and get another HIV test soon just to be sure.

H called me the next morning because he needed contact information or something like that.  He told me that he was guilty for what he had been arrested.  He was mean.  I told him not to come home, and his response was, “This is going to sound mean, but I DO pay the rent.”  I’m a full time university student right now and he supposedly supported me in my endeavors.  It was very apparent to me that he thought his financial contributions outweighed any of my contributions to our almost 6 year relationship.  I found an apartment the day after he was arrested and began the process of terminating our relationship.  (Just for the record, I gave up TWO careers because I chose to be with him.  I don’t regret it because I thought I was making the right decision at the time.  Hindsight is 20/20.)  

Our sex life wasn’t good.  I’ll just throw that out there.  Over the years, I found myself less and less sexually attracted to him.  It had to do with his CONSTANT negative self talk, lack of ambition or goals, and the fact that sex was just plain boring.  To come from a kinky lifestyle to a very repetitious, boring, monotonous sex life was very trying on me.  He wanted more sex than I wanted to give.  At some point, faking attraction gets difficult.  I attended counseling for my lack of attraction and told him that I was working on things.  It wasn’t just bullshit.  I was working on being more affectionate to him.  I even suggested at one point that we open up the marriage.  He flipped.  Now I understand that he was ok with it being open for him, but not for me.  (Fast forward a month, and I realized that my sex drive is VERY healthy.  I fucking love sex.  I guess I just didn’t love it with him.)  I was willing to work on myself because I loved this man and wanted to be a good wife to him.  Other than the sex, I thought everything was great in our relationship.

This past month, I have moved out, had finals for school, started attending therapy more often, filed for divorce, filed for food stamps (denied), and reached out to several different organizations for guidance and help.  I’m not working, and my primary source of income is my VA Disability.  I’m not lazy.  It’s just important to me that I finish my degree.  I graduate next spring, and I’m not going to let his bullshit hold me back.  The hardest thing is that I’m going through this alone.  I’m not from this town.  I moved here with H for his job.  I don’t have any family here, and most of my friends are in their early 20s.  I’m 31.  I think my friends see this as a break-up and don’t realize that this is betrayal, deception, and the end of a marriage.  I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this person.  I wanted children with this person.  In fact, I got pregnant last year and had a miscarriage.  Turns out that was a blessing in disguise.  I’m not confident I would’ve been able to handle this if I also had a baby.  

When H finally came home (before I moved out), he told me a story of what he said happened.  He said he was at a gas station and a woman came up to him and propositioned him.  He said he felt “wanted” and didn’t think about me.  He cried.  I cried.  His story didn’t sit well with me, so I got a copy of the police report.  Bullshit.  His story was complete and utter bullshit.  He planned the meeting through text message THE DAY BEFORE he was arrested.  Remember those flowers he bought me?  Yeah, he bought those right before he went to fuck a prostitute.  He would regularly get me flowers.  He bought me chocolates the week before he was arrested.  When I confronted him about his lies, he said that he was a compulsive liar.  He lies just to lie.  I had no clue.  My friends and family had no clue.  We all thought H was a great guy who treated me like a queen.  He said this was his first time going to see a prostitute, but I can’t/won’t/don’t believe him.  He’s already proven himself to be a liar.

I look back on our relationship, and I can’t see any signs that this was going on.  There’s nothing there.  The only thing I can think of is that he is a trained liar.  That is his job.  (I’m not being figurative, that’s legitimately what he does for a living.)  He gets people to think that he is on their side.  He sure had me fooled.  This man deserves an Oscar for his wonderful, believable performance of loving, caring, well-adjusted husband.

I went on OKCupid last week to try to meet people closer to my age.  My profile says that I’m looking for activity partners, friends, or short-term relationships.  The next day, I saw that H visited my profile.  He already had a profile up looking for casual sex.  My friend suggested I post on Plenty of Fish.  H already has a profile up looking for casual sex there, too.  Out of curiosity, I looked on Craigslist.  Guess what I found…at least this time his post was under “men seeking women.”  We’ve been split up for a little over a month, and he’s already looking to get his dick wet.  Lovely.  He has the nice rental house (I picked it out), and the new car (I picked it out and paid the down payment), the stable job, and looks great from the outside.  He looks put together, and I feel like my life is crashing down around me.  How’s that for fair?  

There’s more to this story, but I’ve already written way too much.  I’ll just end it here.  I’m happy this happened now instead of happening later on when children might be involved.  I’m scared/nervous/excited about my future.  It’s been a while since I’ve been alone, and I can go anywhere and do anything.  The possibilities are endless.

This will probably get buried.  I don’t care.  I just had to get this off my chest.  

TLDR:  Husband was arrested for trying to fuck a prostitute.  Turns out he’s a compulsive liar.  I left him.

EDIT:  It looks like there are several things I need to clear up.  It’s ridiculous that I would feel the need to defend myself or my decisions, but this is Reddit.  I knew it would happen eventually.

Point 1:  Finances.  Yes, he was the primary income earner in our family.  The idea was that I would finish school while he was still in the military, and he would return to school after his enlistment ended and I had a stable, good paying job.  Yes, I did contribute financially to our marriage.  Last year, I received back-pay from the government for my VA disability.  It was not an insignificant amount.  What did I do with the money?  I paid of our debt.  ALL OF IT.  No credit cards, no loans, nothing.  I paid of his car title loan so that he could get the title back on his car.  I paid for the new couch and loveseat set with the rug, coffee tables and end tables.  I paid for the brand new 46” television.  The new car?  Oh yeah…I picked it out AND paid the down payment on it.  I also paid half of the monthly loan payment on it using my VA disability payment.  We used MY name as the primary on the loan because my credit is better than his.  He refinanced the car under his name alone, and his interest rate jumped 10 percentage points.  Sucks to be him.  Again, I don’t feel bad for paying off his debt and buying the things that make the house he lives in look nice (minus the loveseat – I took that as the couch for my tiny apartment).  I did what I thought was the right thing as a wife.

Point 2:  I keep seeing posts about me being lazy because I wasn’t/am not working and receiving VA disability.  Yeah…that’s not going to fly.  I’ve been accepted to an intensive summer program at my university that will help further my long term goals, allow me to receive 9 credit hours of school at no cost, AND pay me a stipend so that I shouldn’t have to work while attending the program.  Getting a job flipping burgers would most definitely help me right now, but this training program will help me in the long run.  I choose not to be completely short sighted.  I have applied for several part-time student positions at the university to help supplement my income after the training program ends.  Oh yeah…it’s VA (Veterans Affairs) disability that I receive because I got hurt while enlisted in the military.  And, I’m using my GI Bill to attend school.  Definitely not lazy.  GPA is a 4.15 (my school allows for A+).

Point 3:  Sex.  Blah blah blah.  It’s my fault he decided to pay for sex because I wasn’t giving it up enough.  Blah blah blah.  /s  Again…not going to fly.  I absolutely take responsibility for my part in this failed marriage; however, I did NOT force him to find a prostitute.  I also was taking positive steps towards fixing my issues (counseling, books, trying to communicate and make suggestions to my partner).  I often brought up our lack of sex life.  It hurt me, too.  His response?  “It’s ok.  Take your time.  I know you’re working on things.”  Lies.  Lies on top of lies.  Furthermore (**this is surely going to get negative responses**), I am under no obligation to sleep with anyone at any time.  This includes my husband, and this includes in marriage.  If I sleep with someone, it’s because I want to.  It may be because I want to pleasure my partner, receive pleasure, or both.  Most of the times with H, it was because I wanted to make him happy.  My duty as a wife isn’t to have sex on command (it wasn’t a D/s relationship, and that wasn’t discussed/negotiated at the beginning of our relationship).  My duty is to be a loving, supportive partner.  Yes, I recognize that involves sex, which is why I was diligently working on my issues.  

Point 4:  Everyone who said not to jump into something and look for dates online is absolutely right.  I have changed my profile to say that I am looking for new friends and activity partners only.  I have also changed it to look for men and women.  I don’t want any kind of emotional relationship/attachment right now.  I would like a friend closer to my age, and it doesn’t matter if that friend is male or female.  I will look into Toastmasters and Meetup.com for other alternatives.  Thank you for calling me out on it, and I respect your advice.

Lady epidemiologist here. The earlier post on maxi pads/sanitary napkins and comments on TSS risk have inspired me to post here to educate those of you who don't already know about the history and true risk of TSS associated with tampon use. 

In the late 1970s, Procter&amp;amp;amp;Gamble introduced to the market a super-absorbent tampon called Rely. Rely tampons were made with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a material that can absorb over 20x its weight in fluid. Because of its high absorbency, the Rely/CMC-polyester tampon absorbed the natural humidity of the vaginal tissues, increasing the incidence of tearing in the soft vaginal tissue during removal, creating a ""gateway"" for bacteria to enter the bloodstream. The CMC itself (combined with the warm, moist environment inside the vagina) provided the perfect breeding ground for the ""toxin"" that is the most common cause of TSS- staphylococcus Aureus bacteria. One Rely tampon could absorb a woman's entire period, and so many women left them in for days at a time (obviously, we know this is a no-no now, but there were no warning labels until after Rely was taken off the market in the early 1980s). When an epidemic of TSS arose in young women in the late 70's/early 80's, the FDA and CDC quickly discovered that the (specific) use of the Rely (CMC-based) tampon carried a higher risk of staph Aureus infection/TSS than tampons made of other, less absorbent, materials (like rayon and cotton), and that the higher the tampon's absorbency, the higher the risk of TSS. The Rely Brand/CMC tampon was then pulled from the market and the FDA classified tampons as a ""medical device,"" so that companies had to put warnings on TSS risk on their products. 

Tampons nowadays are made with safer materials and very, very little TSS risk is associated with their use, especially when they are changed frequently. The TSS warnings are in the boxes due to fallout from the Rely-associated TSS epidemic. Don't let the risk of TSS discourage any of you from using tampons (unless your doctor says it isn't safe due to a medical condition you may have, etc)! The official incidence rate of TSS related to tampon use is 3 cases per 100,000 tampon users (per yr). Relative risk of TSS increases with increase in absorbency, but that doesn't necessarily mean ""Super"" tampons are any less safe than ""Regular,"" IF they are made with the same material and changed at the same rate. The increased risk associated with higher absorbency is: the risk of one material relative to another, less absorbent material (CMC vs. Rayon/cotton, for instance), and/or the risk of leaving in a Super tampon relative to the time you would leave in a Regular tampon (since the Super is simply larger).

Moreover, today's tampons are safe and effective when used properly. Personally, (I also have worked in gynecology) I have seen several cases of women who had ""lost"" or ""forgotten"" their tampons for days, and other than the smell, they were all fine, if not just totally grossed out. This is anecdotal evidence, of course, but I just want you all to know it is not necessarily a TSS-death sentence if you do have a mishap. 

I hope that you, ladies of TwoX, found this post interesting, informative, and helpful! May your next period be light and over in 3 days!!! :)

I was sitting there looking like shit and she takes one look at me, goes into the kitchen and brings me these two bowls of ice cream. 

I read a lot of stories about parents pressuring girls to eat less, dress in certain ways, and all of that. Now while I agree that not all general advice in this direction is ""pressuring"", the problem is pretty rampant, if the stuff I've read is anything to go by. As a young woman with tons of body image issues, the reassurance I get by looking at my 56 year old mother who doesn't have the perfect body but is fucking **beautiful** is unputdownable. 

Thinking back, my mother never tried to foist any of the ""ideal beauty"" concepts onto me. She never told me to shave, or to not shave. She never dissuaded me from doing what I wanted. She never forced her religion down my throat, nor did she make a big fuss about my atheism. 

When I was in 6th grade, my friends' mothers were telling them to wear longer skirts and putting a leash on what they could do. My mother put me in a karate class. She always told me to be on my guard but never made me feel like I was supposed to act like I had less of a stake to claim in this world because I was ""a little girl"". 

My mother chastised a cousin once for teasing me about playing with cars, when I was a child. That shit never flew with her. 

When I told my mother I don't want my marriage to be arranged, she didn't throw a fit and told me that she only cared about what makes me happy. 

My mother grew up in a small Indian town, spoke no English for almost half her life, and was only exposed to the systems and cultures in my country. She isn't perfect and she still has her flaws but everyone does. 

I live in a world where not everyone is this lucky. Especially in countries like mine. And I am thankful, every single second of the day. 

I just wanted to share and I want to listen to stories of people with awesome, strong moms. Because they are heroes and their stories deserve to be heard. 

**EDIT**: I woke up this morning to all your lovely responses. I am so glad to have read them all. I showed my mother this post and she had the most adorable grin on her face and she said ""Oh please, all I did was give you some ice cream!"" Then she hugged me.

1328884390.0,1326,self.TwoXChromosomes,pjdk4,"A story about how I was kind of a bad-ass, and how what I did sparked an awesome change for women and birth control",1724,398,167,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/pjdk4/a_story_about_how_i_was_kind_of_a_badass_and_how/,"Many years ago, I worked for Chrysler as an hourly production employee, one of thousands in my town. I became close friends with another woman who was a union activist and she got me interested in becoming more active in our local union. In 1999 I ran for the office of “Trustee” for our local, and won. Although the position is, in the overall structure, one of the less important ones, it was still an elected, executive officer position, and I was the first female to have held it, and only the second female elected to our local executive board, ever. The UAW was, and still is, a male dominated organization.


One thing that had always pissed me off was that our main union-negotiated, employer-provided insurance plan did not cover birth control. We had two plans: an HMO and traditional BC/BS which was more expensive because it didn’t cover office visits. We were contractually required to take the HMO plan for the first three years of employment, and the HMO did not cover The Pill or any form of contraception. The stupid thing is, in the first three years is when most women need birth control because they’re young women. I mean, a woman who’s been there 15 years isn’t going to be having children due to her age, generally speaking. It didn’t affect me directly, as I was finished having babies and had undergone a tubal ligation. For me, it was the principle of it, and it was a matter of fairness and equality.


The year 2000 was a contract year, which means that it was the year the UAW negotiated new contracts with “The Big Three.” When the contracts are settled, the officers of each local union go to Detroit to hear the details of the new contract, so that they can better explain it to their constituents in the plant. Trustees, being lowly peon-officers were not invited, however, my local union sent us anyway. We were told how to sneak into the meeting and also to keep quiet (since we were not supposed to be there). 


The meeting took place in a huge conference room. There were thousands of union officers in attendance, from every local across the country. I don’t know for sure how many were there, but I would guess 2,000-3,000. At the front of the room there was a stage set up, with a long table spanning it. Sitting at the table were about two dozen people. All but one were men. These people were Chrysler execs and the national UAW bargaining committee. There was one lone woman sitting at the Chrysler end of the table. The rest were men who were 50 years old and older. The room, where the audience sat, was set up with aisles and in each aisle there was a microphone so that members of the audience could ask questions.


After a couple of hours of the meeting, they began discussing the changes and highlights to our healthcare coverage. The man speaking was jubilant as he announced that with the new contract, the men would be able to get 20 Viagra pills per month! Smiles, everyone, smiles! High fives! Pats on the back for all the white haired old fucktards who took care of themselves and their old penises. He went on and on about what a great advancement this was, and how proud they were to have been able to provide this fabulous benefit to their employees. This was The Good Old Boys Club in action.


As I sat there digesting what I’d just heard, I started seeing red. This was one of the biggest “what the fuckity fuck??” moments of my life. I couldn’t stand it. I looked to the aisle at the end of my row and saw there was no one at the mic. I quietly got up and walked over, and as I passed by my local president, he did a facepalm. He knew exactly where I was going and what was going to happen. I didn’t care. I didn’t care that I wasn’t supposed to be in the room, at the meeting, or even in Detroit. I wasn’t letting this shit fly.


I stood by the mic, quivering like jello on the inside, but determined on the outside. After a few moments the man who had been touting the joys and benefits of Viagra called on me for my question. Here is the exchange which took place:

Me: Am I understanding correctly that Viagra is now going to be a covered prescription?
Him: Yes! Up to twenty pills per month!
Me: Ok, that’s great. My question is, why aren’t birth control pills for women covered? I mean, if you’re going to cover one end of sex, don’t you think you ought to cover the other? The two kind of go together, you know. 


First, serious deer in the headlights look from every sonofabitch sitting on that stage. After about 3 seconds, applause. And not just applause… a standing ovation, from every female in the room, including the female Chrysler executive sitting on that stage. I know I was turning 100 shades of red, but I kept going. When the applause subsided, he replied.


Him: We have two plans and the traditional plan covers birth control so if a woman wants birth control she can change plans.
Me: You know as well as I do that the majority of our members have the HMO plan and many cannot change.
Him: We don’t think that covering birth control pills is financially feasible.
Me: Well, it’s a whole lot cheaper than paying for 9 months of prenatal care, which is covered, and then the delivery, which is covered and which can get VERY expensive if a c-section is required, and then at least 18 years of medical/dental/vision coverage for the kid, since dependents are covered – and that’s only if the kid doesn’t go to college, and if the kid does go to college then you have 4 more years of coverage plus tuition assistance, which is covered. So, I’d think that paying for some birth control pills would be a lot cheaper in the long run.

Another standing ovation. I was on a roll…I was high as a kite on the response and in knowing that I wasn’t alone in thinking, “this is bullshit” when hearing about the Magic Blue Pills.


All he said, after everyone sat back down, was “We’ll take it under advisement for the next contract.”

After the meeting, I got my ass chewed by my local president. I told him, “Dammit, John, I was right and you know it, this is bullshit.” He totally agreed, but said, “Couldn’t you have just written a damn letter or something? Jesus, now they’ll be wanting to know who you were and why you were here, when you aren’t even supposed to be here.”  I was also bitched at by a couple of other men in our group, and I promptly told them to suck it. 


A couple of months later there was an amendment made to our contract. They began covering birth control for women :)

To this day I feel so proud, and slightly responsible, if even a tiny bit, for helping thousands of women get birth control. My friend and I still laugh about the frozen expressions on the faces of those men on the stage. It was a beautiful thing.

True story ;)



**tl;dr**: In the 1999-2000 contract agreement, Chrysler agreed to pay for Viagra for men but no birth control for women. I stood up in front of a room of 1000+ people and called them out on it. A few months later, birth control coverage was added to our healthcare plan.




Edit: I work midnight shift and posted this then fell asleep and am just getting back on. Wow, I'm amazed at all of the replies. :) You all rock! Someone questioned how many people were there, which is a valid question. I don't know, exactly. It was held at the Hyatt Regency in Dearborn, MI and I looked at their website to see the capacity of their meeting room(s). Their biggest says it holds 1200. I will say that we were crammed in there like sardines, with people standing up along the walls as well as sitting. I think a conservative low estimate would be 1500 people. It *felt* like more, but it's hard to judge crowd size. In any case, there were a lot of people there. And honestly, it doesn't matter.

1356796739.0,1304,self.TwoXChromosomes,15mlbr,I think it might be an internet thing I grew up with...,1882,578,379,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/15mlbr/i_think_it_might_be_an_internet_thing_i_grew_up/,"I'm currently 16 years old. Since I was 12 years old I've been online nonstop. 4chan, reddit, stumbleupon, last.fm, webcomics, cracked, obscure forums, strange online rpgs, you name it. I've always been aware of the fact that this would probably give me an ""internet mentality"". I've been spending time on these websites throughout some of my most impressionable years.

For the most part this has made me funny, open-minded, and respectful towards others. The internet has introduced me to a million new things and given me a broader worldview that anyone in a small town would get otherwise. I handled the gore, and the porn, and saw the internet for what it really was: a wonderful place for people to come together and just talk. No matter what it seems like in the rest of this post, I truly love the internet, and I credit it for some of the best traits of my personality.

However, I realized something the other day. While being on the internet so much has made me really open minded and introduced me to a million great things, it comes with a price. I accidentally adopted the whole misogyny thing from the internet. To be fair, it would have been hard not to, being in middle school spending hours upon hours on /b/. I pretty much just lurked, but all the women-hate totally got to me. 

I found myself thinking ""I feel more like a guy when I'm on the internet."" But I realize now that I really don't feel more like a guy when I'm on the internet. I feel like a person, with opinions, and ideas, and reactions. I don't ""feel like a guy"", I feel like a girl with a brain. 

I devalue myself for being a girl too. Over the years, ever since I first saw all the women-hate, I've pretty much taken notes on what not to do. I try to be the opposite of all the ""stupid manipulative bitch"" ""attention whore"" ""special snowflake"" talk I've heard over my years at these websites, and not do one of those ""annoying things that girls do"" because I owe it to everyone to be a perfect, amazing, level-headed bro all the time. The moment I saw the first ""so /b/, why do you hate women?"" threads on 4chan, my heart sank, and I felt apologetic for my gender as a whole. I remember crying once or twice about how I was sorry, and how I would never do anything like that to anyone. The internet made me more aware of what not to do I guess, but also it's made me SUPER insecure about myself. I feel boring, and uninteresting, and unworthy of anyone's time. I feel like I'm secretly just waiting to manipulate people. I honestly just feel, deep in my gut, that I'm a bitch.

The women-hate is less of a conscious thing on reddit, but it's here too. If the poster is obviously female, the post is either discredited, hated on, or hit on. Now I'm not saying stop misogyny on the internet, that's pretty much impossible. It's something I grew up with and something I've always had in the back of my head. 

I just wanted to share with you all what the anti-women internet mentality does to the brain of a lonely, impressionable 7th grade girl.

This was pretty cathartic, by the way...

TL;DR: Grew up with 4chan and other sites, also accidentally grew up with their anti-women ideas, now I'm really critical of girls and myself

I have an auto-immune disease so I've been going through the whole ordeal of finding new doctors in a new city. It's important to mention that the city I moved to is highly conservative and VERY religious oriented. 

So, I had a first visit with a doctor today and the first thing he said that alerted me to his traditional values was, ""my primary concern for you and your health is that you're a 24 year old female. I want you healthy so that you can get married and have kids..."" and he continued to explain how my disease could affect my ability to carry child. 

During this conversation I mentioned that I had miscarried last year and asked if it was most likely do to my disease. He gave me a look as if he was taken aback and followed with, ""were you married?"" I told him I was not and that it was an unplanned pregnancy. To my astonishment he replied, ""that's good that you miscarried then. It worked out for you.""

I have honestly never been so surprised in my life. I had no retort; I had no words. I've never heard someone be so blatantly offensive. I wanted to tell him, 'actually I had planned to keep the child, so no, I wouldn't say it's a good thing that I lost my baby.' 

There's really no moral to this story. I just wanted to vent and share my surprise that someone could say something so awful. Not to mention, I highly doubt this man is pro-choice.

I was parking my motorcycle before going to class today and as I got off the group of guys working on the water main repairs in the neighborhood all kind of stopped and started glancing over - this makes me feel weird but apparently a girl on a motorcycle attracts a fair bit of attention judging by the number of comments I get on it.  

One of them asked what kind of bike it was and I told him - it's a 1978 Honda CB400 TII Hawk. It's a small, classic Japanese bike - it's not huge but it's kinda sporty and a lot of fun. He asked how big it was and I replied 398 cc, which is correct, and he sort of snorted and said, ""Sweetie I think that's like a little 250. It's a girl's bike."" 

Wrong. False. First of all, my bike is fucking awesome and you couldn't handle it. I was really pissed off and asked him what he rode, expecting him to answer with some giant Harley - not that I particularly care or judge other riders based on their wheels. 

""I'm on a Kawasaki Ninja 300.""

A KAWASAKI NINJA 300 HAS A SMALLER ENGINE THAN MY HONDA. In this particular case size doesn't matter all that much because his bike is probably faster than mine, but to make this big huge deal over things and then be on A SMALLER BIKE than me is just ridiculous. Like a GIRL couldn't handle a motorcycle, let alone a motorcycle with a technically larger engine. A girl's bike? Yes. I am a girl and it is my motorcycle. Therefore you are technically correct. But just the stupid, casual patronizing sexism made me so mad. 

I wish I had some awesome story about how I went back and forth with him for a while and whipped out my dope technical knowledge about internal combustion engines and made him feel like the fucking moron he was, but I didn't, I just sort of snickered, shook my head and walked away. But I'm still angry and now can't stop looking at giant 1100 cc motorcycles. Even though I wouldn't ever buy one to spite a moron in jeans shorts. Probably.

1346766060.0,1287,self.TwoXChromosomes,zc2b2,Female perspective on street harassment not welcome,1956,669,671,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zc2b2/female_perspective_on_street_harassment_not/,"I need to vent about something. A few days ago, I happened upon a thread in r/worldnews about street harassment in Egypt. *Great*, I thought. *I'm a woman who's lived in Cairo and traveled a lot, I have a lot of perspective on this issue that I'm sure everyone will appreciate!* After all, Redditor's seemed all up-in-arms about sexual harassment. Seemed a bit strange, considering how mainstream Reddit is usually pretty dismissive about women's complaints of harassment, but hey, maybe they're learning?

Nope. Many were, I'm sure, sincerely upset about street harassment. But many more seemed to be using the thread as a vehicle to spew hate about Arabs. They're all animals, they need to be eliminated, this is what happens when you let Muslims run things, this doesn't happen in civilized places. Yeah. As much as I experienced harassment in Egypt, and it was terrible and it's a huge problem and we should be addressing it, it's both inaccurate and unhelpful to pretend that it's a phenomenon isolated to the Arab or Muslim world. I've experienced street harassment in Europe, and have many female friends who have terrible stories about being harassed while living in Europe. So I brought it up. I countered to one of these posters that harassment is a significant problem in Europe, too, and it can't be blamed on Arabs alone.

What followed, over the course of the conversation, was the complete dismissal of my opinion. Every time I mentioned my experiences of being harassed in Europe, I was told that my experience was ""bullshit,"" that this man had been to Europe a lot and had never seen street harassment, that I must have mistaken the Italians' flirtatious nature for real harassment. I was dismissed and consistently downvoted every time I tried to explain that this man's impression of harassment in Europe didn't line up with actions that I have had directed at me.

It made me realize what had always seemed so off to me whenever one of the mainstream subreddits seemed to care about women's issues. Whenever they care about street harassment, or when r/atheism starts caring about the treatment of women in Islam, it's not about the women. They actively dismiss female perspectives in threads like this, and they don't care about women's issues at any other time. R/atheism viciously suppresses discussion about treatment of women in the atheist community, other mainstream subreddits treat street harassment like a joke. It's not about the women, it's about the Arab, Muslim men, and even in a discussion on women's issues, the female perspective isn't considered valid. It's like the discussion of women abroad isn't a discussion about human rights, but about how other men treat their *things*, and things don't get a perspective.

TL;DR: Shouted down for providing my personal perspective on street harassment. I think mainstream Reddit only cares about women's issues as a vehicle for race or religion bashing, and doesn't actually care about women. Anyone else notice this phenomenon, or am I reading way too much into it?",,False,,t5_2r2jt,1346766473.0,,,True,t3_zc2b2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zc2b2/female_perspective_on_street_harassment_not/,

1356100355.0,1275,self.TwoXChromosomes,1587jg,Update: Told my conservative Muslim mother I was raped ,1803,528,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1587jg/update_told_my_conservative_muslim_mother_i_was/,"I posted [this thread] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/153zsg/told_my_conservative_muslim_mother_that_i_was/) about telling my mother that I was raped. 

First of all, the positive responses have been encouraging and helpful. There are a few things I want to clarify though.

**About hijab**: 

I was Muslim my entire life. From the time I was 12-18 I wore the hijab (headscarf) until I ultimately decided I had had enough of it, and I didn't believe in any of it anymore. No one forced me to wear hijab, but there ARE certain cultural pressures from the Islamic community. For example, if you're a female and you ever mention that you're Muslim to another Muslim, you can guarantee that the subject of hijab will arise, why you don't wear it, if you plan on wearing it, etc. Or amongst Muslim men will often be the discussion ""Would you marry a non-hijabi?"" or even if you browse reddit for discussions between Muslim men, you'll see things like ""I met a nice Muslim girl, and I'm considering pursuing her for marriage, but she doesn't wear hijab. How do I know if she's modest?""

In fact, if you google Islamic opinions on removing hijab, you'll often find phrases like women are ""losing their modesty"" or ""becoming westernized"". When I took off my hijab, I had obnoxious Muslim guys telling me that I did it 'to attract men's attention"" or because I had ""given into"" the Western world's opinion of how women should dress. It was very hard for most people to accept that I simply did not believe in it, or Islam. 

**About the hymen issue**: 

In Islam pre-martial sex is a major sin, but there is nothing in Islam that allows a man to check his wife's virginity, or require a woman to bleed on her wedding night. The prophet's first wife Khadija was a non-virgin widow, a successful business woman, and older than him.

 In fact, most prominent scholars of Islam condemn ""hymen checking"" or accusing one's wife of wrongdoing to be a major sin in and of itself. In Islam, it is known that the prophet's wife Aisha was once accused of cheating on her husband, and afterwards the verse of the Quran was revealed that required that 4 EYEWITNESSES testify in order to even ACCUSE someone of fornication. Can you imagine having even 1 eyewitness seeing you having premarital sex, let alone 4? So accusing people of fornicating in Islam is in itself very very wrong and unIslamic. Before anyone brings it up, NO, you don't need 4 eyewitnesses if you were raped. Obviously back in the days of the Quran it was much harder to prove than today, but no serious Muslim scholar will argue that modern forensics aren't sufficient evidence in convicting rapists. 

**TLDR; The reason that the hymen issue has become so prominent in Islamic culture is because of the gravity of the sin of pre-marital sex, Muslim families often don't want their daughters to be accused of having pre-marital sex. Not because Islam commands for a woman's hymen to be intact, but because of the lack of sexual education in the Muslim world that makes people ignorantly believe that the hymen is a valid indicator of whether or not someone is a sinner**


**Now onto my story update** 

After work the day I had told my mom, I went out to dinner with my mother and my friend. My mother was obviously very down the entire time. When we got back to my apartment she came and sat next to me and asked me if I wanted to talk. I told her not really, mostly because I was really embarrassed and didn't know what to say. She kept asking me for details like ""what were the circumstances in which it happened?"" and ""who was it? was it ___? or ___?"" 

I just told her that she needed to trust me when I tell her that that the details aren't necessary, and not something I want to think about right now. 

Then she asked me if I was pregnant, and I told her no. 

Did I check to make sure I wasn't hurt or hadn't contracted any infections?

Yes, I told her I had seen doctors, and had been seeing a counselor and I was fine. 

She was shocked at that, asking ""when did you see doctors and counselors? how long has this been going on? how could my daughter have been going through all of this alone and I didn't even notice? are we really that out of touch?""

At that point I felt bad because I knew she was really sad and felt like a bad mother. I told her ""no, I just didn't want you to be upset so I didn't tell you""

and she said ""but I want to be able to protect you. I could've helped you report him or been support for you. and all of those things I said about rape are hypothetical, it doesn't mean I'm not going to support you. Even if you went and got pregnant by having premarital sex and you came to me with a baby I would've been upset but I'd still take you and the baby and take care of you. I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things""

I told her that I understood she cared about me, but I was largely upset by the fact that she was concerned about my future husband and what he would think, when that should be the least of our worries.

She told me ""I'll tell you something. When I got married, I didn't bleed on my wedding night. I know it's natural for some women to not bleed and it doesn't mean anything, but the men of our culture are taught to think it means something. So your father made me feel bad about it, and would frequently bring it up, and I didn't want you to deal with that"" 

I told her I understood, although I think this generation knows better. She was still worried though and asked me to please not use tampons anymore, just in case I still have some of my hymen and we can salvage it (lol) . I laughed because it was kinda cute and told her OK, sure, we'll see;. 

Finally she told me that she hopes I'll at least be able to talk to my older sister about it, because she wants me to get the support I need, even if I can't talk to her about it. 

Overall, it hasn't been as bad as I expected. Yesterday she was crying and saying that she feels bad things have happened to her family because god is trying to punish her. Obviously I told her that was ridiculous, and god doesn't facilitate rape to get back at people lol, but I guess some things will take time for her to realize.

I am under eighteen, have been with my boyfriend for a year, and have heard a chorus of ""underage sex is bad,"" ""unmarried sex is bad,"" and just plain ol' ""sex is bad"" from my peers and from most adults regarding this matter. 

However, after talking to my mother and my boyfriend about it, I realized I was not frightened at the prospect of ""losing my v-card"" so we did it with condoms on Saturday. And it felt *fantastic*. He was attentive to my needs, he made sure he was going at the right speed, and kept things very relaxed and comfortable. Afterwards, we watched a movie together and he stroked my hair while we cuddled. We've done it twice again since then.

It did not make me depressed, it did not make my grades tank, it did not make me an irritable and emotional sociopath, but it also did not make me a woman. PIV sex did not change a single thing except the fact that genitals instead of fingers were inserted into me. If I didn't love him before having my ""Sexual Debut"" with him, I wouldn't love him now. But I did love him then, and I do love him now. 

Not planning on having sex again until I'm prescribed BC or an IUD (better safe than sorry), but man, I had sex and I loved it. I'm not even a little bit ashamed. 

Thanks for listening, TwoX. 


**EDIT:** Oh god, obligatory top post edit. I'd like to thank my vagina and my internet provider. I can't reply to all of you so I just want to say thank you SO much, I am reading every comment and taking everyone's advice. I will be speaking to a doctor this week and making sure I choose something that is right for me. But overall, I am just so happy that I can be part of a breed of women who like sex and aren't afraid to talk about it.

 For everyone who lost their virginity in bad circumstances: virginity is and always has been a social construct. Some people consider losing their virginity having oral sex, or having anal sex, or even kissing. As I have just learned firsthand, sex does not define you. *YOU define you.* Experiment, have fun, do what makes you feel good. ""The second half of the play is usually better than the first"". I just happened to get lucky. Love you, TwoX. Stay golden.

A woman who had just finished washing her hands asked me if I needed some water and I said, ""No, thank you. I'm fine,"" in what must have been a very unconvincing voice.

She left the bathroom and I struggled to pull myself together. I got up and blew my nose, trying to not blow snot over myself when I heard the bathroom door open again. 

She was back with a handful of soft tissues. You know those special kind with the lotion on them?

She handed them under the stall door and said, ""Here. These are a lot softer than toilet paper.""

I took them and choked out the words thank you and she left me to clean myself up.

After she left I just started crying harder than before. Her kindness was exactly what I needed. It was such a small thing to do, but I felt so overwhelmed with the sense that everything will be okay. I just want her to know how much I appreciate her kindness.

I'm an American-Indian. Or Indian-American, I don't know which comes first. 

My white, hipster, Mormon friend is visiting India. She is updating her friends and family about her experiences using a blog. 

I can't put my finger on it, but I read her blog today and it is driving me crazy. She depicts India as this magical, mystical place, where rich, white, people go to discover themselves. She goes to yoga classes during the day and tours temples by night. I don't know why it bothers me so much, but it does. Maybe it's because half the guys who have been interested in me were more interested in an ""Indian girl"" than me. Maybe it's because when I was little and participated in my culture, I was considered an outsider by my peers. Maybe it's because India is complex and she's perpetuating stereotypes. 

I really don't know, but it's driving me crazy. I know she can't help it, and traveling is good because it'll open her mind up to new experiences. She was talking about how she got into a temple for free, bypassing the lines and not having to pay any fees. She wrote about it as though it was cool but it just made me angry. She cut in front of people, she got in for free when other people had to pay, just because she's white. I feel like she's not actually experiencing India and understanding what it is, she's just choosing the convenient parts of India that fit her hipster definition of what India should be.  

I'm not sure why I'm taking this so personally. I feel like her dumbing down India to a bunch of stereotypes without realizing it, is an extension of the times in my life where I have been dumbed down to a bunch of stereotypes. India is complex, I'm complex, and I'm Indian but I'm also more than that. Does that make sense? The fact that she is doing this unintentionally and harmlessly almost feels worse, because she doesn't realize she's wrong. Just like the people who have boxed me into a little ""Indian girl"" box don't realize they're wrong. They're not actively picking fights, they're just having conversations with their arsenal of facts. The sun is a star, the earth is a sphere, Indians are spiritual and magical. So it doesn't even occur to them that they might be wrong, because they have no reason to think that.
 
Am I crazy? I know I'm crazy. Has anyone else ever felt like this?

   I teach high school, and yesterday two things happened that made me mentally thank all of you wise and loving women here on 2X. First, a tenth grade girl confided in me that she was being harassed by a boy but didn't want to say anything to him because she 'didn't want to hurt his feelings'. Before, I would have understood her discomfort and counseled her to avoid him (which means avoiding the library and cafeteria...and all her classes...). Instead, we talked about how her feelings were as valid as his and that she had a right to a comfortable work space. Then we role played how to firmly but politely assert herself, and then what she could do if it didn't work.   
 
  Then, I had an AMAZING dialogue with my class of all 9th grade boys about why sexist, derogatory jokes are not ok. I was able to clearly explain my thoughts: that they were worthy and good people who deserved an equal partner (they are obsessed with getting girlfriends right now) and that the way they were talking about women was going to chase away the awesome ones, AND how tolerance of jokes like that lead to a hostile environment for women - and that their mothers and sisters and friends were women too. By the end I could see this dawning understanding on their faces. It was AMAZING.

Some of the [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/123a64/this_guy_whipped_out_his_dong_at_a_feminist_pride/) on the post berated women for being too sensitive, and  frequently used the term ""feminazi"" when referring to those that thought the guy was out of line. Many also implied that a man exposing himself is not threatening, this is specifically what I wanted to discuss. I wanted to share my story about why I feel it is threatening for a man to expose himself to a woman (we're not talking baseball diamond streaker).

When I was still a kid (14) a 40-something year old man exposed himself to me in a parking lot. HAHA so funny, right? Get over it, it's not a violent act. Well actually he ended up hopping in his car and began following me. I didn't know what to do, I was petrified and small and knew that I wouldn't stand much of a chance if he was able to get me into a secluded area where he could possibly attack. The only thing I could think to do was memorize the plates on the car and book it.

Luckily as I ran, I happened to stumble upon a cop car patrolling by the woods of the local library, where I was able to report the incident (later had to ID him and eventually received a subpoena in the mail, though he plead guilty prior to the trial). I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't come across the police, how far he would have kept following, or if he would have dragged me into his vehicle once I reached a more deserted area. I looked up his record later to find he had been charged with violent crimes in the past.

A man exposing himself is always a potential threat because the situation can quickly escalate into a full on assault, and you have no idea whether that will happen or not. What happened to me may not seem like a big deal to most people. However, as a child, having to come home with the police and explain what happened to my parents, and later in detail to a prosecutor, was humiliating and, to some extent, traumatizing. 

The point of me posting this is not to say whether the guy in the picture was a threat or not or to discuss his actions specifically, but more to discuss how the act of a man exposing himself to a woman against her will, is threatening in many contexts, though it seems that many people view it as immature at worst. Of course many men and women already realize this, but not all of them. Sometimes I feel like brushing off or excusing actions such as exposing oneself to an unwilling bystander allows institutional sexism to continue. By affirming, and not condemning such actions, we are saying, hey its okay to make women feel uncomfortable because it's just how things work. 

Anyway, it's late so I'm getting off topic, the point was, I consider the action threatening because it can and sometimes does lead to a more serious offense. It could have escalated in my situation had I not found help.

A couple weeks ago though, a conversation came up about ""hook-ups"" we'd had, which is a conversation I did not want, I didn't want to know about him and I didn't want him to know about me. Either way, apparently the girls he had met kinda sucked, and he asked to try us again. I was in no possible way going to get back with him, ever. We got into an argument and he proceeded to verbally accost me, tell me I was a dirty slut, a desperate whore at the club, he was disgusted by me, etc. All of this was assumed from the very vague answers I gave when he was asking about hook-ups I'd had. 

He was always verbally abusive to me, and I didn't realize it until that day. He tried to apologize the next day, but I am not willing to forgive him this time, and I haven't spoken to him since. I will not associate with someone who treats other people the way he does, and I finally feel free of him. I feel so much better about myself. This is the longest I haven't spoken to him and it is the best decision I've ever made.

TLDR: Finally stopped speaking to my verbally abusive ex, best decision of my life.

Last night i had dinner at a local bar and grill.  I was the only female in a group of male coworkers. This is typical in my industry.  Few females involved in sales in the company, unfortunately.  Everyone ordered drinks.  I'm a beer fanatic and this place has kickass craft beer on tap.  I got a porter and someone remarked ""isn't that like packed with calories""?  I shrugged and told them it had about 170 per 12 ounces which is fairly normal for a beer of its type.  Then I get a smug response of ""well clearly my Bud Light is better""!  Yeah, ok, drink whatever you want, buddy.  Fast forward to ordering dinner.  I got a Reuben sandwich, side of chips and pickle.  We all proceed to eat dinner and I ate my whole sandwich and pickle.  This prompted a round of comments to the tune of my cohorts being shocked that I did not choose a healthy option on the menu(ie salad),  that I ate a whole sandwich, and that I had 2 craft beers.  I then got grilled about how much I eat in a typical day and if I would have to run ""extra"" miles to burn off my Reuben.

Seriously?  I was really hungry and wanted a damn sandwich.  This should be the end of story.  But no, women are only ""ok"" eating a sandwich and having some beer if we're sure to go work it off.  Look, I like eating healthy but I don't run or train to burn off beer calories.  I run because I like it and want to run a marathon.  I eat Reuben sandwiches and drink beer sometimes because they're delicious.  Sometimes I enjoy salads, too.  I should not have to spend time at a work dinner defending myself.  None of the others at the table were questioned about eating their entire burger or entree so I should be no different.

I remember being 16 with no money of my own, scared that I was pregnant because my period was late.  PM me, and I'll be able to fund two on a first-come, first serve basis.  If any ladies can also afford one, maybe comment below in case there are more than two people that are in need?  Random Acts of Pregnancy Tests!

I was thinking I could buy you an Amazon Giftcard for the amount of the pregnancy test, and then you could purchase it so that I don't need to know your shipping address.

Happy Sunday, ladies.  

EDIT:  As of 10:34 EST, I've been contacted by two people.  If for some reason one test opens up, I'll post again.  

**/u/Pelagine, /u/Tiekyl, /u/knitterofknowledge, /u/chiyos_pigtails, and /u/irishgrrl have offered assistance.  Please contact one of these gracious human beings if you are still in need.**

/u/lizzyborden42 says that Wal-Mart and dollar stores carry pregnancy tests for less than a dollar.  If you can get to one, try those!  But for anyone that doesn't drive, hopefully one of the other two gracious ladies here will help you out.

As of 11:15 PM EST, one has been successfully delivered, and I'm chatting with someone else right now.  Thank you all for your kind words, I definitely didn't think this post would be so popular but I hope that this can happen more frequently here.  For those of you that have PM'd me your stories, please feel free to keep in touch. I'm only 19 and I have a lot more to learn, but I've been through a lot of lady-stuff already and I hope I can help anyone that needs it.  Remember, you can get condoms for free at your local Planned Parenthood and at most colleges and universities.  [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TAU1Z_CEs4) video is an awesome resource about all sorts of Sex Shields to prevent pregnancy and STI's!

As of 12:06 AM EST, I've delivered both of my pregnancy tests.  This community is amazing, and if anyone finds this post looking for help in months to come, you can always PM me and I'll try to work something out.  

**Does anyone know of a service like this that actually exists?  I think a non-profit that could send out the strips in envelopes to girls would be a really neat idea, but I have no experience with running something like that.  PM me if you would be interested in exploring this idea!**

Final Edit: It's now 7:18 AM and I'm still AMAZED by all of your comments and stories.  I was even gifted Reddit Gold! WHAT?! WOW.

We've been dating for 6 months now and we're supposed to be spending all of December together, as we live 5 hours away.

On Friday night I had gotten some dinner with a friend, and stopped at a gas station to fill up. While pumping gas, a man attacked me with a knife, pulled up my skirt, and sexually assaulted me. Luckily, it was 7:00 PM, so there was someone in the convenience store so I managed to push the man off and run inside for help. My attacker was arrested.

Because there was a clear surveillance camera, and because he only penetrated me with fingers, a rape kit was deemed unnecessary. They took photos of my injuries (I had a scratch from the knife, and a friction burn from where he ripped my panties off) but I did not need any medical treatment besides the basic EMT care, so I went home. 

I called my boyfriend and he had no idea what to say to me. He was very quiet and our conversation only lasted for five minutes, even though I begged for him to drive down to see me. He said he couldn't. I just sat in my bathroom and cried after he hung up, and then I went to immediately get a drink and called my friend over so we could smoke and make me feel better. About two hours later, I called my boyfriend again for some comfort and he was over at his cousin's house. He said he didn't want to seem rude to his cousin and her friend, so he had to be quick. I said that it's not rude because it is a legitimate reason to talk to me. He said it was, but he didn't want to tell his cousin the reason why he was on the phone.

On Sunday morning, we were texting and he mentioned something about me driving the 5 hours to see him for sex. I said I could not, because I have to get an STD test. About an hour later, I called him on Skype and we were talking when he called me a feminazi (he says it was a joke). I flipped out on him, because I am a feminist, and obviously I was offended. I only wanted to actually talk to him about what happened Friday night, but he ""doesn't know what to say"" and ""He'll only fuck it up"". So now it's Monday afternoon and we still haven't spoken. I just want to die, but I know suicide isn't an option (I'm currently in therapy). 

TL;DR: Sexually assaulted on Friday night, bf didn't want to listen to me, ignored me until Sunday, we got into a fight, now we aren't speaking and I feel awful.",Possible trigger,False,,t5_2r2jt,False,trigger,,True,t3_14m6ju,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/14m6ju/i_was_sexually_assaulted_friday_night_now_my_bf/,

1345054553.0,1173,self.TwoXChromosomes,y9uc0,"My sister got stood up two months ago, and the guy texted her the other night like nothing happened looking to get drinks. We had as much fun as possible with this and got our revenge - story inside!",1763,590,265,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/y9uc0/my_sister_got_stood_up_two_months_ago_and_the_guy/,"At the end of May, my sister Casey met a guy at our local bar. He asks her out. She tells him she's not very dateable - she works long hours and she doesn't have much free time - but she'd be happy to have drinks and see how it goes. 

The next night, he texts her saying he'll let her know when he's done with his early-evening engagement and they can meet up at the bar. She sit at home and waits for him to call. Eleven o'clock rolls around, and he texts her saying that it's late, and he's just going to go to bed. 

Casey's miffed. She's never been stood up before. Luckily, she's got pretty unshakable confidence, so she shrugs it off as ""Oh, so that's what that feels like.""

Later that week, he asks to meet up again. She agrees. Maybe it was just a fluke, and she figures she'll give him another chance. He tells her he has a going away dinner, but he'll be at the bar at nine o'clock to meet her. 

She sits at the bar until about ten, passing time with the other regulars and our bartender, until she texts him. He apologizes, says the dinner ran late, and he's on his way. He'll see her in just a minute.

She doesn't hear another word from him for two months. 

Until last night. She gets a text message. Guess who it is?

You got it. It's Bar Guy. Bar Guy asks if she remembers him. Then, without missing a beat and with absolutely no explanation for the past two months of radio silence and blown off dates, asks her out for drinks. 

Now, at this point we are just marveling at the stones on this guy. Not only does he stand a girl up twice and never talk to her again, he immediately asks for a date two months later after zero communication. It's almost impressive. 

She says sure. Now, we're sitting in our pajamas in the middle of a hardcore Newsroom marathon. Nobody is going anywhere. She figures she'll just give him a taste of his own medicine and not show. I want to point out that she's not vindictive - if he had explained himself, or seemed at all regretful, she would have just turned him down and it would have been done. But she had gotten stood up twice with no explanation. Now it was his turn. She tells him she'll see him at the bar at nine. 

He replies, and I shit you not, ""If you're lucky.""

IF YOU'RE LUCKY. 

It's on now. A no-show date is not enough. His punishment must be more severe. 

A plan is hatched. We go to the theatre where we work and fill up a huge hot pink balloon with helium. She writes on it, in huge block letters: ""I GOT STOOD UP BY CASEY BECAUSE I'M A TWAT."" 

Our friend Riley executes our plan. Riley walks into the crowded bar and calls his name. 

""BAR GUY. BAR GUY? IS BAR GUY HERE?""

He's sitting at the bar. He raises his hand. Riley strides over to him and hands him the biggest, hot pinkest, most shameful balloon you've ever seen in a crowded Irish pub and turns around and walks out.

He reads the balloon, pops it, and books it out of that bar without finishing his drink. 

Sorry, Bar Guy. Lesson? Don't stand up a girl twice then expect her to go out with you.

And why the hell should we be ashamed of that? ,1762,596,571,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/trggh/who_here_takes_birth_control_to_control_birth_and/,"Hi, I am British so there isn't any stigma over here at all for taking birth control to prevent pregnancy - so I guess i have it easy. I just wanted to know, and maybe all you american gals can shed some light on this, why the hell is everyone so fucking nosey?? Whose business is it to care whether we have sex for pleasure? In fact, over here it is ADVISED to go on birth control AND we get it for free. 

I understand the economic issues but I DON'T understand peoples problem with it morally. Surely it is economically beneficial to proved birth control? You don't want to pay maternity leave. I am in a long term relationship. I hate condoms. And frankly, GTFO if you think you can judge me for that. We should NOT be ashamed to enjoy sex, nor should be feel ashamed to not want children. 

I have heard so many arguments for medical reasons to take the pill - and they are all extremely valid - but why is 'wanting to have sex' not valid?? we are NOT whores. we are NOT sluts. 

Phew sorry. Just wanted to get that off my chest. But seriously gals, WTF? 

Edit: Also just wanted to say - some of you have raised the issue of 'no one cares if you have sex - the government just doesn't want to pay for it'. I understand that. BUT from what i also understand it's always a good idea to provide free birth control. People are always going to have sex - with or without BC, and those who cannot afford it are not suddenly going to go celibate. Those who cannot afford BC are not going to be able to afford a child - child benefits are expensive too as is maternity leave. So you may not want to pay for birth control but do you want to pay for them to have children they don't want?

[I had a very rewarding day](http://casey0402.imgur.com/kitten#UHv5A) and I just wanted to share with you. 

I work in a veterinary hospital, and today a delivery man came in and told us he had found a kitten on one of his routes, it was just laying on the steps of some corporate building and people were ignoring it, just stepping over it.  He said he had stopped at one other hospital before ours, but they wouldn't take her.  He had been driving around for a while with this dying kitten.  He couldn't take it to the humane society because he is tracked by GPS and was only taking her to places on his route.  He felt very bad for her and didn't think she would make it.  We told him we would take care of her.  

My coworker went to get her out of the truck, and brought her into the treatment area.  I thought she was dead.  She was completely limp and her eyes were closed.  We put her on a circulating hot water blanket, and hooked her up to ECG, Pulse/ox, blood pressure, and temperature monitors.  Her heart rate was very low (50), normal cats are 180-200.  Her body temperature was 82.2 (normal temperature for a cat is 100-102).  She was completely lateral.  We thought she was going to die. We did not intubate her as she wasn't quite sedate enough for that, so we put an oxygen mask on her, then switched it to just a low flow (that's what that thing is in front of her face) and placed an IV catheter in her.  We also used something called a bear hugger, it blows heated air into a thin blanket (they use it in pediatrics too).  We gave her some drugs IV to get her heart rate higher and help with her glucose, assuming it was very low.  We did some bloodwork on her and she does have some abnormalities.  Finally after about an hour, her body temperature warmed up and she started purring, then trying to meow and move her head around.  We sat her up sternal and I put some food in front of her face but she wouldn't eat.  So I mixed some warm water up with some canned food and put it in a syringe.  Once it was in her mouth she started eating on her own... I'm sure she hasn't eaten in days.  This was very exciting, a good sign!  So we have been monitoring her throughout the day and I took her home with me for monitoring throughout the night.  We all thought she was going to die.  She is doing better, but not in the clear yet.  I don't know if I'm going to keep her, maybe just foster her until I find a home for her, we'll see what happens.  I just wanted to share this story with you guys!!

**edit.**  Thanks guys for all your nice responses!  [The kitten is doing better today](http://casey0402.imgur.com/kitten_2#33XQS).  When I woke up this morning she was sitting up and eating on her own.  It also looked like she may have drank some water on her own overnight.  I was worried about her kidneys, but she did produce some urine overnight.  She did have some bloody diarrhea while I was at work.  I gave her an antibiotic injection and she'll start oral antibiotics tomorrow.  She's been sleeping most of the day, and when I brought her home today she was curious and wanted to explore.  Loki (my Jack Russell) is very curious about her... he keeps whining and sniffing her but when she turns around, he runs away.  She keeps trying to make friends with him... walking up and rubbing against him, meowing at him.  It's really cute.  We didn't do any more bloodwork, we will probably give her a couple more days and then do bloodwork again.  She is very underweight, she is only 1.4 lbs and she should weigh around 3.  But she is willing to eat, and seems to be staying hydrated.  Thanks everyone.

**edit #2 - 9/29/11.**  Thanks to those who are following her progress!  She is doing much better.  Today the delivery man had stopped in to see how she was doing, just as I had hoped.  He just kept saying, ""That is awesome, this is great"" with a huge smile.  She is eating a lot more now, and also eating on her own.  Still a long road ahead for her, but she is doing much better than expected.  My boss told us again today that this is a miracle kitty.

Being a generally who-the-fuck-cares type of person in regards to trying new things sexually (and because I bore easily and dislike saying no to new things), I agreed.

Well, after some effort, lube, and a decent amount of stretching, they both fit.

As they should have.

And he was . . . horrified.  I'm not sure if it was one of those things that sounded better in his head before trying it or what, but he was *shocked* that what he perceived as a nice-feeling, normally-sized vagina was capable of that.

""Wow,"" he said, ""I thought . . . I dunno, you were tighter than that or something.  Jesus.  I think I fucked up your vagina.  How is sex going to work from here on out?  Because I can't imagine this is going to feel the same again.""

Well, I pitched a fit and kicked him out (overreaction, yes, but fuck you, new boyfriend).  

My thing is: how do people not understand how a vagina works?  Do you not realize that a *newborn human baby* needs to come out of that thing when women give birth?  That it needs to stretch and be elastic for that to occur?  And that since women are capable of getting pregnant multiple times, that the vagina *has* to maintain roughly it's original form at some point to fit a penis in comfortably?  Jesus Christ.

**TL; DR: My boyfriend was shocked that my vagina stretches and it made me feel bad.**

EDIT: Wow, guys, the support has been incredible.  For the record, I did try to discuss it with him briefly.  ""You know that, like, a vagina is also meant for a *baby* to pass through it, right?""  He said, ""Right, but still.  Christ.""  I said, ""Okay, this is not a weird thing.  It's normal.  It's normal that it was able to stretch like this.  It's not going to forever be in a place where two dicks can just slip right into it.""  He said, ""Yeah, I doubt that.""  *That's* when I got upset.  Refusing to listen to logic =/= acceptable behavior. 

EDIT 2: He's 25, I'm 24.   We're both in law school, both intelligent, both worldly. 

EDIT 3: After reading through some of the comments, I find ""how the hell is he supposed to know how a vagina works"" to not be an excuse.  I know how a penis works because I did the research.  I looked things up.  Talked to people.  Even the smallest bit of research will help drastically.  I find a lack of research on a sexually active person's part to be just as damning as a lack of sex ed, which seems to be the (very understandable) general consensus.  There are thousands of available resources.

EDIT 4: Not being able to think because he wants sex is a ridiculous excuse.  Do you not think women go through something similar?  Where we're all fired up and ready to go and *fuck all* that gets in our way?

1371698294.0,1142,self.TwoXChromosomes,1gpcpd,Thoughts from a nurse on how obesity being recognized as a disease will affect women,1509,367,796,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1gpcpd/thoughts_from_a_nurse_on_how_obesity_being/,"So some of you may have seen that obesity is now going to be recognized as a disease by the American Medical Association, or AMA. The NY Times did a [good article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/business/ama-recognizes-obesity-as-a-disease.html) about the medical standpoint behind the decision. I'm not going to be going into their reasons for doing this, because that's really not whats bothering me. I think it's a good thing they're doing this, personally, but that's just my opinion. Whats bothering me is how the lady blogs I frequent are handling it. 

They're not discussing the medical reasons behind the decision. They're not concerned with how this will affect treatment. Most of these bloggers have little to no medical education or background. No, what's really bothering about it is that it may increase the stigma behind obesity, especially in a society that already has a very warped view of the female body. 

I'm going to stop right there and say that obesity is not a male or female issue. So there's that to start with. But just to play along, let's pretend that this is somehow different for women than for men.

I can't speak for all health care workers, or even most of them. All of us behind the scrubs are human, and many of us have our own biases and prejudices. I know that certain nurses, doctors, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants will treat overweight and obese patients with disdain, give them dirty looks, insinuate that they should ""just go on a diet"" or ""just exercise some more,"" and ignore the real problems that lead to obesity. But I'm just here to give my view on it, and I hope anyone reading this who is overweight or obese knows that there are many nurses who share my point of view.

I don't care how you look. I don't care that you are overweight. What I care about is when people hide behind their feelings as a way to avoid the real issue with obesity- your health. This country puts so much emphasis on looks that we like to forget that obesity is a *health* issue, not an aesthetic one. Some women mope and use their bad feelings as a way to hide, saying (honestly) that the social aspect of their weight is causing overwhelming depression, and they just don't have it in them to change. Other women hide behind a sense of confidence, claiming that they're happy the way they are, that they're healthy still, and fuck off to anyone who says otherwise. They're big and beautiful and dammit if anyone thinks they can put them down because of it. 

I'm going to be completely blunt. How you feel about your weight is **not** an issue. It is irrelevant. If you think I'm wrong, or that I'm being too harsh, go into a neuro ICU or a stroke unit, and ask those women who are paralyzed on one side how they feel about their body image. Or better yet, go to a surgical unit and ask someone who just got their foot amputated how they feel about being stigmatized due to their weight. Confidence will not prevent the high blood pressure that leads to stroke and heart failure. Your feelings will not affect the diabetes that leads to recurrent infections, blindness, amputations, and death. 

Harsh, yeah. But believe me, I get no joy from walking into a patient's room and seeing them unable to pick up a glass of water by themselves, or seeing them develop incontinence because they're unable to get to the bathroom on time with their crutches. I don't like seeing my aunt, who is the most loving and caring person in the world, sleep on two pillows because her heart can't pump her blood fast enough to keep fluid from building up in her lungs, causing her to start drowning in her own blood plasma when she lays down at night. And I don't like having to have this talk with patients who refuse to do anything about their weight because of some reason related to their feelings. The emotional reaction to obesity is certainly an issue with treatment. But let's address it, talk about it, and work on fixing it. Let's support each other through the emotional ups and down. Let's not hide behind it.

As women, we are harshly judged on our bodies, and women who are obese face ridicule, verbal abuse, and mockery on a daily basis. But that shies in comparison to the health problems that not all, but **most** obese patients develop. These health issues are no joke. Stop thinking about your feelings, and start thinking about your health. Because believe me, **the people who love and care about you the most don't give a damn about how you look in a bikini.** They want to see you healthy, happy, and old. Our society is starting to think differently about obesity. Let's keep it moving in the right direction. 

**TL;DR** How you think about your weight is irrelevant compared to how it affects your health. Women should support each other to tackle this as a health issue, not as an aesthetic one. (Sorry it turned into an essay, ladies.)

Also, please no comments such as ""I bet you're skinny."" 1. You don't know that, and you don't know what sort of health issues I have, and 2. That's exactly the sort of emotions-first reaction that I'm pointing out as counterproductive to the real issue.",,False,,t5_2r2jt,False,,,True,t3_1gpcpd,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1gpcpd/thoughts_from_a_nurse_on_how_obesity_being/,

We've been in a LDR for a couple years and I've always made sure to keep myself covered, specifically my belly and upper thighs, even it it was just with a satin nighty that just barely covered things. I was absolutely dead terrified of him seeing that part of me, it is scarred from abuse, there are stretchmarks from pregnancy and I hate the sag that has come since I have started losing weight (40lbs down 65 to go). He has always made me feel like the most beautiful woman on the face of the earth, but I always felt that if he saw that part of me that he would look at me with disgust and that would be the end of it. 

Today on camera, he saw me from head to toe naked, I was literally shaking like a leaf in a hurricane. He didn't get a look of disgust, he didn't recoil, he told me I was beautiful, ""a true sight to behold"", he showered me with such love and patience and I freaking lost it. I sat down and sobbed, I shook, I cried harder than I have ever cried in my life, but not because I was sad. It was a weird combination of several emotions, fear, shame, relief, love, acceptance and some I cannot put words to, and he listened to me, reassured me, and just continued to remind me that he loves me and finds me beautiful. 

I have had past partners comment that I would have such a pretty pussy if it hadn't been so beat up, saying I looked like a used up hooker (I was pretty badly sexually abused as a child), and yeah, I know they were immature assholes that based their opinions on all the porn they watched but that shit hurt and it sticks with you and I'm sure there are women here who understand how easy it is to be insecure in the look of your genitals. And God knows pregnancy does not do good things to the belly, and a nasty postpartum depression thanks to an abusive ex and I gained a lot more weight than I care to think about and all of it lead to me feeling like the most hideous monster on the face of the earth whenever I was undressed. 

I'm still scared, I've barely managed to stop crying, but I love my SO, he's been so supportive. Part of me is terrified that he was just being nice and really finds me to be ugly, but I know that is my insecurity talking and projecting and that he really does love me.

To all the ladies (and men) out there, that are afraid and feel ugly, please know that you are beautiful, to someone you are beautiful. To all those who are confident in your body, regardless of size, scars, stretchmarks, whatever, especially those that don't fit into the conventional ideals of what is beautiful...I commend you and am more than a little jealous, but please don't stop, because you're courage and confidence helps others find their own beauty.

Okay...I'm off to go cry some more and try to find a way to show my SO just how much I love and appreciate him.

**edit** wow, this has been just amazing, it's been a heck of a night with everything and I want to tell each and every one of you thank you so much for all the kind words! For those that were like me, please know, you really are beautiful and there are people that will appreciate you for all you are, flaws, scars and all. I love you all!!!

**edit2**This has truly been an overwhelmingly beautiful experience, not just with my SO, but with the outpouring of support and love on here. I want to say to all those that struggle with accepting yourself and seeing the beauty that you carry with you always, please know, you truly are beautiful. We all have something we don't like about ourselves, something that makes us insecure, but we are all still beautiful.

My mother is Indian. My father is Pakistani. However, it's not really my dad- it's my mom that's the problem with this issue right here.

For goodness' sakes, she's an OB/GYN and when I mentioned that I wanted to use tampons once (when I was 15) she said 'tampons are for married people.' WTF. WTF. Ever since I was a little girl and I started my period, I used pads. I hate it. I hate pads!! She would tell me things like 'oh just try using a tampon. You won't be able to get it in.'

And I wasn't able to use tampons. For years I thought tampons were just for 'married people.' Or girls who had already had sex. 'The only reason these young american girls can use tampons is because they're all sexually active' (my mom).
I was too embarrassed to tell any friends or try to get any help... I mean, I'm not gonna get a friend to help insert a tampon in my vagina. -_- And it just seemed silly...

But I was frustrated! I tried having sex- nothing would ever go in and it would hurt. Having oral performed on me was annoying. It didn't feel good. And forget about fingering myself HAHA. My entrance was way too small for that, right? It was fucking annoying. I wanted pleasure but I would always tense up or get nervous and feel pain.

Then I got a yeast infection, and I had to use monistat- that pill you put in your vagina? I was all frustrated and stuff because 'how am I going to use this?!??!?' 
My mom bought some for me and I was like 'uh, you talk shit about using tampons and you're telling me to use this stuff???' She proceeded to be all like, ""TAMPONS ARE DIFFERENT. THEY'RE FOR MARRIED PEOPLE."" I was all like 'okay whatever.' It took me FOREVER to figure out how to put this shit up my vagina. It was frustrating. It took over 20 minutes. 'I'll never be able to get this shit up my hole..."" I poked and prodded and it seemed like there was some stupid wall blocking my hole and it was so frustrating! 20 years old and I didn't know how to work my own sex!
And then suddenly it went in...

I was shocked and surprised and ecstatic. TRIUMPHANT! The monistat applicator went in smoothly and IT DIDN'T HURT. It felt normal. And then I pushed the medicine in and gently took the applicator out. And I was like '...... I did it.' It wasn't even that hard! I went to the gynecologist at my school before, and whenever they would try to check me out down there, it would hurt and be so so so uncomfortable. Everything always felt wrong down there. I was like.... it's like I was conditioned to think that my vagina was this shriveled thing that I shouldn't be touching. I guess I had been conditioned to think that nothing could ever enter my vagina.

But I applied my yeast medication three times! And you know what? After my infection was gone, I tried fingering myself with TWO fingers! And IT WORKED. And you know what? Next up is tampons! Or sex! Whichever comes first!!

TwoX, I was always so frustrated, but now it feels like I've finally been able to stop being so self-conscious and so nervous. It feels like I can ENJOY having my vagina played with now. It feels GREAT. I don't have to be nervous or scared of my genitalia. I don't know why I ever was in the first place. Oh wait, because it's only for 'married' people -_-


Anyways, feels good. But I'm curious- For all of you, how was it when you first started fingering yourself or using tampons?? Was it uncomfortable? I feel like I just jumped on this bandwagon now- and I'm 20! Share your thoughts and stories!

Edit: AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE! OMG WOW! Your experiences are all so interesting! Thanks for being awesome, girls!! I kinda thought this thread would only get read by one person, much less commented on. Thanks for listening and sharing!! 

**edit: tl;dr: I finally figured out how to explore myself sexually and be comfortable with my lady parts. Before? I was always uncomfortable with my vagina- I could hardly get sexual pleasure. It was frustrating. Added to that, I hated using pads, but tampons were out of the question. I couldn't be examine by a gynecologist without excruciating discomfort and pain because I was so nervous and tense. 'It will always hurt,' I thought. But now? I can finally be sensible about this stuff and not have to worry about pain. I've learned how to explore myself sexually and will hopefully be able to use tampons without any negative stigma or pain!**",,False,,t5_2r2jt,1358635535.0,,,True,t3_16vqbl,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/16vqbl/im_20_and_i_i_just_figured_out_a_really_huge/,

1347941047.0,1114,self.TwoXChromosomes,1029ug,Just some thoughts on body image &amp; clothing from a sales associate in retail,1351,237,406,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1029ug/just_some_thoughts_on_body_image_clothing_from_a/,"I just recently began working in retail at a women's clothing store, and I have been blown away by some of the disparaging remarks customers will casually toss around in reference to their bodies. Tiny women feel bad because our smallest petite sizes don't fit them, ""average"" sized women feel bad because they're a size or two bigger than they were in college, curvier women feel bad because they have big boobs or wide hips. It doesn't matter what size a woman is--each one who enters our store is just as likely to express frustration with her body. 

Just the other day, I helped a woman find her size in a dress that she'd been eyeing for months which had finally gone on sale. She was so excited about trying on the dress--a beautiful pink sundress with a full, flowy skirt--but as soon as she tried it on, her entire demeanor changed. She looked gorgeous in the dress--it suited in slim build, and the bright color flattered her--but she felt self-conscious in it, because it had a bit of a v-neck and seemed to think that it emphasized her smaller bust. It broke my heart to see her optimism and excitement wilt so quickly because of a dress.

These experiences have really gone to show me that women of all sizes feel bad about their size, and it makes me worry a great deal. So many beautiful, kind women walk into the store, and speaking to them, I find that they're so interesting and funny and sweet. To see these women, who I would have imagined as such confident ladies, falter so quickly because of how they look in one particular outfit, is incredibly upsetting. It reminds me of all the times I've spoken badly about my body--how I've only-half-teasingly talked about how hard it is to find cute clothes for my pear-shaped body or spoken poorly of my small boobs--and it makes me want to start being more positive. 

All of my insecurities have been cropped up because of a failure to meet an ideal which really doesn't exist. In our society, women of all sizes are criticized. And the self-criticism only perpetuates the idea that women are somehow falling short by failing to please everyone. 

So next time you go shopping, please remember that your body is a wonderful thing. Look for clothing which flatters you, but don't allow yourself to believe that if you were another size, that would make you more beautiful or worthwhile as a person. Find the things that you love about your body and focus on emphasizing those. It's important to buy clothes which flatter you, but ultimately, the clothes that will make you appear most beautiful are the ones which make you *feel* beautiful. I never see customers look more radiant than they do when they find something that just overwhelms them with happiness. 

Stop focusing on diminishing the appearance of things you hate, and begin embracing the things you love. ",,False,,t5_2r2jt,False,,,True,t3_1029ug,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1029ug/just_some_thoughts_on_body_image_clothing_from_a/,

Edit: Other women have mentioned that seeing these posts has been incredibly triggering and painful, even forcing them to unsub from 2X for the time being. If you are an advocate for standing up for victims, why not create a single thread for victims who are comfortable posting about their stories to post them, while at the same time not subjecting other victims to terrible triggers every time they log on to reddit. I don't believe it's fair to expect respect for one group of abuse victims, while at the same time totally alienate another to the point where they don't even feel comfortable being a part of this community right now.

I don't even know what my options are at this point.  I applied to Texas' victim compensation fund and was denied because the attorney general could not ascertain whether a crime had actually taken place or not.  I talked to someone in billing, and the lady asked me if I wanted a payment plan.  It took me so much self restraint not to lose my shit.
No, I don't want a payment plan, I want to not be held responsible for this because a rape kit is part of evidence collection.  She said she'd send it for review, but.. I just feel like charging a victim for a rape kit is ridiculously wrong on so many levels.

If any one has any advice for what I can do, I'd appreciate your guidance.  Thanks.

**Edit:** Thank you all so much for your support and advice.  I cannot tell you how grateful I am for everything that y'all have said.  Right now, my plan of action is to get everything ready - talking with someone at my school, filing a claim with my health insurance, writing a letter to state representatives/congressmen (and possibly the media while I'm at it), and getting finances ready in the event that I do have to pay.  After this is over, I'm going to figure out how to fix this, so that no one else has to go through what I'm going through.

**Edit 2:** To those who are saying that I should pay for it because it's medical services rendered, I've talked to an advocate in my area, and she says it's the first time that she's heard of someone being sent a bill for antibiotics or plan b or anything related to a sexual assault kit procedure.  I'm really not supposed to be paying anything, and I remember being assured of this multiple times by the SANE nurses.  If I got x-rays or medical treatment beyond prophylactic antibiotics/plan b, that'd be a different story.  For example, I requested prophylactic antivirals for possible HIV exposure, but I was explicitly told that I would have to pay for that out of pocket.",Possible trigger,False,,t5_2r2jt,1354765305.0,trigger,,True,t3_14btsh,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/14btsh/being_billed_by_hospital_for_rape_kit_help/,

Olivia is dating my best friend in the entire world, and they seem really great together, so my husband and I have been trying to get to know her better.

Anyway, we're having a lovely day.  Having some drinkies and brunchies, and sitting at our favorite bar.  We go into this bar about once a week usually for dinner or drinks.  Think MacLaren's Pub on HIMYM.  

This guy sits next to Olivia and they strike up a conversation.  All is going pretty well until he starts to rub her back.  She says ""I have a boyfriend, so please stop.""  He starts again, so I go ""She said stop.""

Guy freaks the fuck out:

""What the fuck is your problem?  This is none of your business.""

""It's always my fucking business when someone asks you to stop touching them and you don't.""

""You're a fucking bitch.""

At this point I'm like ""Ok, fuck this, I'm getting the manager/owner (who is also a friend of mine).""  So I walked out to get him and explained what was going on.  Dude is still hovering over Olivia, so the manager stands close to us behind the bar and fakes washing dishes.  

My husband told me he called me a fatass whore when I walked off.  I am not a fatass, nor a whore, but it's none of his goddamn business even if I was.  So I was like ""Did you have something you wanted to say to me?""

""NO YOU FUCKING PSYCHO CUNT BITCH!""

Manager goes ""EXCUSE ME. DID YOU JUST CALL HER A CUNT?  YOU CAN GET THE FUCK OUT.""

Guy was like ""Hey manager I'm just fucking around...blah blah...""

Manager was like ""Fuck around somewhere else then, buh bye.""  

Anyway.  He left while screaming obscenities, and I got up and hugged the manager and also left him like a $20 with a little note saying thanks.

TL;DR Some people are assholes, but most of them are super cool.

I asked hubs, and he said he was confused about what the guy said bc this all went down in about 2 mins...he said he wanted to hit the bro but knew I wouldn't approve. Normally hubs has to keep guys from hitting on me so I don't think he even knew the jackass was talking about me until after the fact.

Also, some troll pmd me and was like ""Keep telling yourself you're not a fatass slut. I know you are. I hope you get raped."" 

Lol.

That is the worst trolling ever. A.) fatass whore was the terminology used. B.) get raped is just something women tend to hear on the Internet these days--not that its ok by any means...Doesn't make it ok, buy srsly, come up with SOMETHING original.

Lol. Me and my hubs and my best friend are having a great time laughing.

1359957413.0,1098,self.TwoXChromosomes,17uqar,"I had a horrible experience at Walgreens last night trying to buy the morning after pill. A reminder to all TwoXers: know the law, and know your rights.",1446,348,514,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/17uqar/i_had_a_horrible_experience_at_walgreens_last/,"I just had an experience at Walgreens in Texas that, all at once, infuriated me and invigorated me. Here's a slightly condensed version:

I was hanging out with my male friend last night, and around 11pm he got a text from his little sister (17 y.o.). She'd had a condom break, and didn't know what to do. She was at her mom's house then and couldn't leave, and she certainly didn't want to tell her mom. My friend and I immediately left to go to a Walgreens with a 24 hour pharmacy, get the morning after pill, and rush it to her.

We get to the pharmacy and there are all sorts of sketchy types around, and we had to wait in line for quite a bit because there was only one guy working the pharmacy. Now beforehand, I'd told my friend that I'd help him and tell him what to ask for, but I requested that he be the one to buy the pill, because if by some WILD stretch of probability, the pill made his sister sick or something, I didn't want to be liable. I googled ""can men buy morning after pill"" and found that yes, as long as they provide proof that they're over 17 years old, they can buy it. I left my wallet in the car since I wouldn't be needing my own ID.

As we waited in line, I debated if I should leave in case the pharmacist asked to see my own ID. But I reminded myself that as long as the buyer was over 17, he should be able to buy. And anyway, the pill wasn't for me! And anyway, my poor guy friend was very nervous and stressed out and had no idea what he was doing, and I wanted to be there with him. So renewed with confidence, we waited our turn, not really expecting to have any trouble.

Finally our turn, my friend mumbled, ""I need the Plan B pill..."", and the pharmacist, a man of about 40 with a big gold cross hanging from his neck, got the box and came back to the counter. He asked to see my friend's ID, which he did. The man then looked and me and said, ""IS THIS FOR HER?"" Yes. Seriously. I was appalled, but I'm naturally a very non-confrontational person, so I sort of laughed and said, ""No, I'm just the moral support,"" and gave my friend a pat on the shoulder.

The man said, ""Well, I need to see the girl's ID [*I'll clarify here: he meant the girl that was going to be taking the pill--not me*] to make sure she's over 17."" And I replied, ""No, you don't. As long as the buyer is over 17, regardless of whether it's a man or woman, you can sell it to them. You don't need to see the woman."" The guy gave me a smug, suspicious look, and I could tell that he ""knew"" that I was the shy, embarrassed girlfriend, and that it was for me. He then proceeded to refuse to sell us the pill unless he ""saw the girl's ID and she was here"". 

Normally, I'd raise a stink. But there's a time and place for everything, and all we needed that night was to get the pill as fast as possible. So I said, ""Fine, it's for me then. I'll get my ID."" I ran to my car, got my ID, and shoved it in his face, just thinking, ""YEAH, you caught me, aren't you fucking clever. You've successfully shamed me, and the pill isn't even for me."" And as I showed him my ID, he sort of smirked, then he sold us the pill.

Long story short, we successfully got the pill to my friend's sister, and all was well. But it took us a while to fully comprehend what had happened to us. What happened to us was WRONG, and if this ever happens to you, or your significant other, or a friend, or some guy you know, know that you can stand up for yourself. You do not need to identify yourself as ""the pill taker"" if you, or any of your friends that are of-age, regardless of gender, are buying the pill. 

On one hand, I am violently upset that this happened, because it's a reminder that these gross injustices are happening all over the place, and people that don't know the law and don't stand up for themselves (like my poor guy friend) are getting screwed. But I'm also vibrant right now...I'm feeling *alive*. I know my rights now, and I know the email address to the ACLU of Texas and Walgreens corporate headquarters. I'm going to fight to end shit like this, and I'm telling everyone I know.

Info about the Plan B pill: http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm109783.htm

There is no reason for anyone, of any gender, to not get the pill if you are of age, even if the pharmacist has ""moral issues"" with it. From http://www.tsbp.state.tx.us/planb.htm :

""Currently, Texas law does not have a conscience clause allowing pharmacists to refuse to sell a product or dispense a prescription based on moral grounds. However, a pharmacist does have a professional responsibility to his/her patients.  If a pharmacist is unable to sell a medication or fill a particular prescription for any reason, he/she should refer the patient to another pharmacist at the pharmacy, if possible, or refer the patient to a pharmacy where the patient may obtain the medication. ""

Alright, I'm blathering on. I just want you girls (and guys) to be prepared for nonsense like this.

Update.,1348,256,164,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1bm2gx/this_better_be_an_april_fools_prank_update/,"[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1bguof/this_better_be_an_april_fools_prank/)


A few people asked for an update, so here's what happened.

Yesterday I called the company back, asked to speak to whoever is in charge of my interviewer, and then had a very difficult conversation with a very competent (and kinda awesome) business owner.

I started the conversation by explaining who I was (an interviewee) and that I believed one of his employees may be putting his company at risk for legal action. He got a bit defensive until I explained that I was not personally interested in suing him, after that he was very open to what I had to say. 

He asked me to tell him exactly how the conversation went, as close to verbatim as I could remember, and then asked me to email him my resume so he could ""get a better understanding of what the heck 'stellar' is supposed to mean."" He went over my resume and gave a quick run through on normal interview questions. He asked if he could put me on hold so he could speak to his employee, and ten minutes later was back on the phone. 

The first words out of his mouth were ""I am so very sorry this happened to you Miss InKitchen, and I would like to know if there is anyway I can make this up to you. What our employee did was wrong, and I hope this hasn't tarnished your view of this company.""

I said that all I wanted was that she was made aware of what she had done wrong, that she apologize to me and anyone else she had done this or something similar too, and that they take a second look into all the other applicants to make sure they get a fair chance at employment. He said that he would have done all that without my asking, and that if I'm still interested he'd love to schedule me for another in-person interview. 

I explained that I didn't think I would be a good fit for office tranquility if the other woman were to stay employed, but that I am always willing to try to get a job. I've been scheduled for a new interview next week, which should give them enough time to sort out all the issues this woman caused. I was told I would get a phone call for her verbal apology and a written one once she was completely made aware of her wrong doings. ""You, and anyone else treated like you by one of my employees, deserves a sincere apology. I will not allow just a scripted 'I'm sorry' and a signature.""

Due to the sensitive nature of the situation I don't know what happened with other applicants or my interviewer, but the owner did make it very clear that changes will be made and wrongs will be made as right as possible. I know this isn't a drama-filled climatic ending, but I'm actually very glad about that. I hope she learns a lesson and that the company is able to grow in a more positive direction. 

Thank you everyone who commented and messaged me with support, advice, commiseration, and well wishes! You are an amazing community and and pretty awesome individuals.

1361162782.0,1094,self.TwoXChromosomes,18qetg,"My private Photobucket albums were ""ripped"" and posted to a porn site this week. I wanted to share the anonymous message I got informing me about it, and talk about privacy, exploitation, and the shaming of female sexuality.",1534,440,375,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18qetg/my_private_photobucket_albums_were_ripped_and/,"(^(Background information is at the end.))

I am hardly upset about strangers seeing me nude. What I wanted to share are the deeper implications and what really bothered me about this situation:

1. The hackers for and viewers of this site expect me to be ashamed, because society would find such a thing a shame on me, and they relish the fact. As Anonymous pointed out to me (I've posted the conversation in the comments.), this could hurt me in pursuing a career. Why should it hurt my career that someone did something shitty to me? My body is not obscene. It is not shameful. And it most definitely should not be a source of outrage for anyone else. These situations are a shame on the people who seek out ways to exploit women and use their bodies against them. They are not a shame on the women who have the gall not to be veiled in their private moments.

2. Images of naked women who actually want those images public are abundant, free, and in much higher quality than the crappy camera phone pictures lifted from my albums. People like this delight in divorcing a woman from her agency. It is the non-consent precisely that makes the site I was posted to so successful. It is the blatancy of this kind of love of rendering women powerless that makes the denial that rape culture and sexism exist so frustrating.

3. The hypocrisy of those in our generation who are outraged by things like SOPA, the Patriot Act, or any minor breach of privacy, but delight in and defend things like creep shot forums and exposing women.

I did not push the issue, but it really bothered me that the person who came to me chose to do so anonymously, when I did not have the luxury of privacy. Then he made several attempts to hit on me behind that anonymity. That unfairness was clearly lost on him, and he seemed very comfortable in the face of what he perceived as vulnerability from me.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a few general pleas and reminders to anyone reading this:

1. Please remember to respect the privacy and dignity of all people.

2. Please try to recognize when you objectify a person and find yourself wanting to downplay the fact that they are humans living human lives.

3. When viewing porn, please be aware of what you are supporting when you give a website your page views and help them generate money. Please do not support people who make a living off of other people's bodies without their consent. Please never help a website deny a person her autonomy.

4. Please be conscious, and be kind.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Background:**

I had a private Photobucket album that was just a personal archive for myself. It had pictures of myself wearing outfits I like so I could look back on uninspired days, like a virtual closet kind of. It had pictures I kept for weight-loss/fitness comparison, mirror shots of me in bathing suits or nude. It had some pictures I had uploaded from friends' computers when it was easier than having that person send them all to me. It had some pictures of my drawings and me making goofy faces. It was almost like a private photo diary.

It seemed safer than just keeping them in a folder on my computer, as a backup in case it crashed, and being password protected there since I let other people use my computer sometimes. That was obviously wrong thinking.

I didn't use it very often and almost never linked images from it anywhere, just because there wasn't anything there I really cared about sharing with others.

At the beginning of this week I got an anonymous message on Facebook, which I'll post in comments with the full conversation, from someone claiming to be from my university and to have stumbled across the porn site with hundreds of my pictures, of which maybe a dozen were nude.

As a result, fitness is very important to me, but I still have a very stereotypically feminine body type (small, long blonde hair, the whole deal) and fashion sense (makeup every day, lots of pink clothes, etc.). Currently, I'm a grad student and TA. 

The other day at school I was helping to set up some presentations for the students I teach. It was myself, the male prof, and 4 other male TAs. The prof needed help moving a table and said, ""Madzos, could you come help me with this?"" But one of the other TAs was standing right there, so he helped instead. The prof then said, ""Oh, yeah, I guess anyone can help. I don't know why I asked for Madzos. I guess she just looks the most muscly."" The other TAs agreed, stating that I do look the strongest/fittest out of all of them, and that what I consider ""out of shape"" for myself is still much better than their own fitness levels.

I was so happy to be complimented this way, for three main reasons:

1. It was a compliment on my body that was nothing to do with how attractive or feminine I am, but rather was a comment on how my physical appearance reflects my skills.

2. It was a compliment that wasn't qualified by the idea that I'm strong and fit ""for a girl,"" but just that I'm strong and fit as a human. Not one of the boys batted an eye at the idea that the only girl in the room might also be the person best qualified for a physical task.

3. The mere fact that it was men saying it! We get so used to getting creepy compliments from men and being wary of sexual harassment (even in professional settings), that to have a discussion about my body with 5 guys and not feel remotely uncomfortable or objectified is amazing!

Then we took our son to an indoor play place since the weather was so crappy today. I was still pretty weak from the morning, so I did a lot of sitting while my husband chased our son around and helped him do things (he's only 2). At one point I said to my husband, ""Hey thanks for watching him so much."" And he responded with, ""Well, I *am* his father."" 

I kind of just smiled and said that I meant that I wasn't being much help and he shrugged and said it was no problem. But I just love my husband's attitude with childcare, he doesn't view it as doing me a favor. He just views it as being a father, which is awesome.

Just had to rave a bit, thanks to anyone who read! Good guys are out there!!

EDIT: I am surprised this got a lot of attention. I just want to clarify I was **not** surprised at my husband taking care of our son, he always does.

(If you didn't read the original post, go [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1aql1b/after_months_of_trying_to_figure_out_why_my_bf/) )

I knew already what had to be done, as I was really quite unhappy. I just felt...paralyzed somehow. 

Finally, on Tuesday, I geared up for it, and had the talk with him. I explained that I'd never before had a relationship where sex totally dropped off (without the uninterested partner being involved with someone else, that is). I asked him, point blank, why we were having literally NO sex, and he straight up said ""I have no answer for that"". (Which is also weird.) I explained that if there were more physical intimacy and less emotional intimacy, or vice versa, I would be happy. But not having EITHER emotional OR physical intimacy was just not working for me. 

I also explained that I realized it was unfair for me to always be demanding that he change; that if we are to be in a relationship, we should be able to accept one another as-is. But I also said it wasn't fair that I was being totally unfulfilled by our relationship. I told him I care for him a lot, but that it wasn't working and that it needs to end. 

I cried a whole lot. I felt sad. Had a few glasses of champagne with a sympathetic friend. Went home and fell asleep at 7:30 pm. Woke up, felt uneasy, disjointed, uncomfortable. Browsed reddit until 4 am. 

It's only been a couple of days, and things are weird- I haven't been officially ""single"" for...years. My relationships always tend to bleed over into one another, I think because I have been afraid of being alone. 

I made an OkCupid profile. And you know what? I've gotten a ton of responses from intelligent, handsome, educated, interesting men who are interested in me. I don't want to rush into another relationship by any means...but damn, ladies...for the first time in a long time, I've felt attractive, desirable, and vital! 

I was able to stand up for myself and damn if it doesn't feel good.

All of us know is a lie, specially the pharmacist and it was obvious that religious interests where involve. My friend ended up going to another pharmacy which charged her 45 dollars for the ""Next choice"" pill. When she told me about it, I felt very infuriated, and I want to report this incompetent pharmacist, specially since I don't want this incident to repeat with the next customer, and to get that person in trouble so other pharmacist will not even dare to act in such a unprofessional manner ever again. Twox, have any of you experience this? And how can we report this person?

*Edit*: I'm more infuriated because it was in one of the poorest area of the city, is also the borough with the highest rate of teen pregnancy . Also people, I concern that she lied about it, not what cause her to.
Also, I'm assisting my friend by researching the best way to handle this situation, she will primary report it herself while I will serve as a witness, and morally extend my support. While, the reason of getting a morning after pill was not the cause of an unfortunate event, she felt very bad about it, and I believe no person(man and woman who met the requirements) should go through this hassle, also, pharmacist should be knowledgeable and up to date with their drugs, specially such a well known drug, by now, this should be common knowledge among pharmacists, and excuse my optimism, but even among the general population, who I hope, in this state received an adequate sex education. 

EDIT 2: So people are saying in some states is her legal right to refuse it, which I understand, but it's her legal right to lie about it and said I need a prescription for Next Choice, morning after pill? Keep that in mind. The lying is the worst part here.

EDIT 3: For all that is holy to you, people, take a moment and read. The pharmacist didn't refuse it, she LIED about it, LIED. There's no legal rights or protection for lying about drugs requirements. 


EDIT 4: We were going to Plan-parenthood but due to Sandy, it was close. I want to take this moment to thank 
Plan-parenthood which provides the morning after pill for 25 dollar or less, and even at no cost if you can't afford it, hassle free, and in a timely manner.

I couldn't think of pigtails without thinking of porno.

On the rare occasion I left the house with them in, I always experienced a bizzarre rise in harassment.  Everything from the innocuous 'nice pigtails love' to strangers hitting on me.  When I wore them to work my boss made a crass 'while you're down there' joke.  Wholly depressing.

But I am RECLAIMING THESE BABIES, damnit.  I love pigtails.  They keep my hair out of my face and I think they are cute.  I am not going to let fear of harassment or porno-association deter me from wearing them.  FUCK YOU PORN FOR STEALING MY HAIR STYLE.

In celebration, [I took a picture.](http://imgur.com/HKAAG)

FO REAL THO - does anyone else find it they get more harassment/attention when they wear piggies?


EDIT : as someone pointed out, I prolly shouldnt be putting 'strangers hitting on me' automatically in the bracket of street harassment. However, sadly, 98% of incidents where strangers have 'hit on me' it's usually in a way that I feel constitute harassment; following me, making rude or aggressive comments, touching me, repeatedly trying to talk to me after I've politely declined their offer and sometimes blocking my way. That stuff. The 2% of incidents where guys have got it right (I.e talked to me like a fellow human being, maybe dropped a compliment or two and politely asked for my number), I've almost felt like applauding them. I've never given my number in that situation because I've never wanted to, but I am usually flattered and don't feel unsafe. So apologies for generalising.

Also, thank you so much for all the compliments (mental!) and sharing of your experiences. Great to hear both the positive and the negative - especially the more serious ones which really highlight the subtle lengths some ladies go to to avoid harassment and negative attention from others. This was my first proper post on TwoX (I usually just hang around in the comments endless regurgitating rape statistics), and you've made me feel super welcome and glad to be surrounded by a community of lovely men and women.

He was surprised I wore the same bra two days in a row and thought that you had to skip a day between wears. I asked him where the hell he got *that* idea and he just said he'd always assumed it.

Then her asshole (ex)boyfriend showed up at my front gate (I'm so glad I have two big dogs in my yard) and started yelling obscenities at both of us. These small-minded dirtbags do not intimidate me—I know their type—and I yelled back. I know where he works and I know his landlord (this idiot just moved in next door). He'll be unemployed and homeless soon enough if I have anything about it—if he doesn't end up in prison first.

I took pictures of the goose egg over her eye while he yelled, ""That's right, take pictures!"" ""Oh, I am!"" and then he rode off on his bicycle.

I called 911 again as they were taking a while. A motorcycle cop from the next town showed up to stay with us until the local force came by. When she told him her attacker's name, he said, ""Oh, I know him. I tazed him once."" The local cops showed up shortly after and took her statement, got my name, and took pictures of her injuries. She was still trying to minimize the whole thing and I urged her not to sugarcoat it. All the local cops know this guy; they said they've been dealing with him since he was 18.

Turns out she has a ""no verbal abuse"" protective order against him (I didn't even know there was such a thing) and he is on probation for previously breaking her arm. She's reluctant to press charges even now, but the officers and myself urged her to do just that. I told her I will be more than happy to come to court with her as her advocate.

He had called the police from down the street to file his own report; he was promptly arrested.

I shared with her my history of abuse and how I overcame it. I didn't hold back. The cops even told her to get out before something bad happened, before he killed her. I told her that more women are killed when they try to leave. She's in the process of moving out and had come back this morning to get her stuff. He broke her phone so I gave her a TracFone I had lying around; it has over two hours of time on it and my number pre-programmed.

She said the cops seemed a little mad at her; I told her they hate domestic violence more than anything and it's very frustrating for them and they just want her to understand the gravity of the situation. I felt like I, too, was lecturing her a bit more than I tend to do with most people, but I feel very strongly about domestic violence, child abuse, and animal cruelty. I've been in abusive relationships, I've done rape crisis counseling in the past, I've been involved with animal rescue, and I care about what happens to her and she needs to take this very seriously. She's already given this guy too many chances and he's not going to change. When the lead cop left, he told me, ""Don't coddle her."" I told him, ""I'm not. I've been in this situation, I know how serious it is.""

She said she was embarrassed to go to her family and I told her she had no need to be. Even though they hate this guy and they may seem upset with her, it's because they truly care and want to help her. Her brother's been trying to help her find a place and I told her to bring him with her when she comes back to get her stuff. Do not be alone around this guy!

She's pregnant by this guy and admitted she has a drinking problem that is exacerbated and enabled by him. I offered to go with her to an AA meeting if she'd like (I know what some people think about the program, but it helped me a lot). She thought it was a sign of weakness and I told her, ""Au contraire. It's a sign that you're motivated to turn your life around. It looks good with the courts and social services."" (She's already dealt with two DUIs.)

So that was my morning! In addition to dealing with my elderly mother's fall and broken hip and my dear elderly neighbor undergoing extended emergency open-heart surgery, I'd say my plate is pretty full. I haven't had to do full-on lioness advocacy in a while. It's kind of exhausting but very fulfilling.

If that jackass shows up at my gate, I'll remember to record him this time. It didn't occur to me this morning, I was just concerned with taking care of her.

Thanks for letting me vent.

P.S. The gal told me he already has three kids he's not in touch with. I spoke to the neighbor in the front house and they said he'd bragged that he already had two felony strikes against him (I looked him up in two local counties' court systems and this appears to be bullshit). I spoke to the landlord over there and he told me he'd already begun eviction proceedings. The front door to the unit and three windows are broken; the front door and one of the windows had sheets tacked up over them.

I am unhappy to say, that shaving resulted in a form of dermatitis that apparently happens after shaving (I found this out after calling my gynecologist freaking out) . Basically, all my bits became red, itchy, flaky, and just...horrendous.

...and I couldn't see it. Not even in a mirror (I couldn't get a close enough look). So finally, I decided that I'd use my lovely iPhone to snap a few shots of my pathetic and, honestly, really really disgusting looking cooch. I took the photos, looked, and forgot about them...

Until yesterday. I was talking to a random male stranger about dogs, and I pull out my iPhone. First few shots are of my wonderful pup, but one or two swipes too many leads to a photo of my bare, raw, flaking, hideous bits. It was a bad picture. Like...medical-photo worthy bad. It would be embarrassing enough if it were, you know, a *normal* crotch shot...but this had to be the most vile photo ever taken of any body part of mine.

I don't know how I managed to laugh it off at that moment, and the guy didn't give me any trouble, thank baby jesus.

-That is how I took the above quote - that some dudes (not all - let's not generalize) ego's are so out of whack that there couldn't possibly be anything about them that a girl wouldn't be interested in - so if she isn't interested then she is friend zoning him - it completely excuses the guy and puts all the ""blame"" on the girl.

-There is a clear point I'm making here. I'm not bitching about friend zoning, I'm bitching about people using the term incorrectly and using it to justify why they got rejected, shifting the blame from them to the other person - this works on guys and girls. I'm calling out people on not being rational adults.

-That being said I agree that it's a mis-used term because it does happen (I've friggin seen it people, and in real life, not on the internet!) and it's not cool when it does, but to rationalize someone not being interested in you as ""being friend zoned"" is pathetic and immature. No one is obligated to date anyone and if you feel like you're being emotionally taken advantage of then be a big kid and exit the situation - no one is forced into being ""friend zoned"".  

-Don't be an asshole (men and women).

Here we go! (Warning: it gets gross.)

I just got out of the hospital a couple of weeks ago. I am supposed to be drinking a lot of liquids and I've been doing my best.  It's certainly not the worst problem, but the constant peeing does occasionally get annoying. It's become a joke at work...they moved the water bottle at work next to my desk and have designated one restroom as my very own. 

Today I left a little early from work. It's my boyfriend's birthday, and I am making a huge, fancy meal for him, so I was in a rush to get to the store and get home to start cooking. While in the car, I feel the urge to pee getting stronger by the minute, but there isn't much I can do about it now. Like any adult, I can just hold it until I get into the store and use their restroom. 

By the time I get there, though, it is baaaad. I need a bathroom and I need it now. I am duck-walking in the store, trying my best to move only my calves because I am clenching my thighs so tightly. Of course, the bathroom is at the back of this huge, fancy store. Oh, did I mention that this is a beautiful, high-end grocery store that I have been frequenting for years, so everyone there knows me? I really should have. So as I duck walk/run to the back of the store, I am getting a few glances.

Finally, like some angelic vision, I am in the small hallway where the bathrooms are. But there, right in front of the door, my body betrayed me. As I grasped the handle, I started peeing. I rushed in, undid my jeans and sat on the toilet, but  was far, far too late. The entire floor was covered in pee. My shoes were soaking. Thank god my dark jeans didn't look it, but they were sopping wet. 

I cleaned up the best I could (both myself and the bathroom) and practically sprinted out of the store. I stopped only to tell the customer service desk that it looked like ""someone"" had an accident in the bathroom and that they should chevk it out. I actually almost slipped on the puddle still outside the bathroom *shudder*.

I called my boyfriend on my way home, told him that dinner was off and that we'd go to his favorite restaurant instead. But it would be a later dinner, I told him; I needed a drink, a bath, and some time weeping quietly to myself.

And to make matters worse, I now have to find a new grocery store. Sigh. My boyfriend told me not to feel bad, and that the same thing had happened to him...when he was five. I told him that making a girl with a hair-trigger bladder laugh while sitting on HIS couch wasn't the best decision of his life.

TwoX, All of my life I've felt ugly, clumsy, awkward. The last word anyone would use to describe me would be ""graceful"". I'm insecure and it shows a lot - from nervous laugh to eventual stuttering. I hate big groups of people and I always feel like I don't belong.  
But today I had my first class. I taught philosophy. And not to middle schoolers who were forced to be there - to adults who went because they wanted to hear me talking about the subject I'm most passionate about. And you know what? I rocked. I explained the shit out of Hegel. I made my studens laugh, I made them think, I explained every doubt they had. I gave a hell of a class.  
And it showed! I was feeling confident because I was doing what I was born to do - and it's not like I was feeling it! I was a nervous wreck when I walk in there. But somehow I put all of my doubts behind as I talked.  
I've always heard that when you feel happy and confident you are attractive. I never believed it. But now I know it's true! I *feel* beautiful. I feel powerful and happy. I did a good job, people enjoyed the class and I'm having one of the best days of my life!  
  
So... I may not be a dancer. But today I feel like dancing! So please, take my word: Stop having doubts and *do what you want to do*. Don't be afraid. It's *so* worth it!

Hey TwoX, thanks for all your amazing words. I'm so happy reading your answers. Today I'm back being my usual dorky self (I missed my stop on the subway this morning!!) but I'm still feeling great from yesterday.

1371959224.0,1033,self.TwoXChromosomes,1gw47k,My vagina eats Diva Cups for breakfast,1310,277,281,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1gw47k/my_vagina_eats_diva_cups_for_breakfast/,"Hi everyone, this is an update on my (truly horrible) Diva Cup experience.  My original post is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1f80ky/i_simply_cant_figure_out_the_diva_cup_please_help/ Sorry for the huge amount of text, but I wanted to get the entire experience down.

For several months, I have been gathering up the courage to make the switch from pads and tampons to the Diva Cup.  I got advice from friends and family who had been fully converted, and I did a fairly extensive amount of internet research, seeking out success stories and failures alike.  The failures (extreme difficulty inserting, the need for medical attention for removal, etc.) seemed to be few and far between, with most people only experiencing minor inconveniences during their first few attempts at using the cup.  So I handed over my 45 dollars to the cashier when purchasing my new Diva Cup and Diva Wash with the confidence that I would never have to spend another cent on pads or tampons, even if the cup was a little tricky to begin with.

Unfortunately, the Diva Cup and I are not meant to be.  I began experiencing difficulties immediately, and I wondered if I was one of the seemingly very few women who simply could not insert a menstrual cup.  I tried various folds and body positions from the mundane (squatting, sitting on the toilet, lying down) to the slightly uncomfortable (bent over with blood rushing to my head, lying down with knees pulled to my chest, lunging as if I were starting a race) to the ridiculous (one leg up on a high kitchen counter).  My attempts spanned three cycles, but not one was successful.

Finally, mercifully, I was able to insert my Diva Cup on the first afternoon of my current period (The method that worked for me? Squatting slightly, punch down fold but inserted with the folded part facing down.)  My first few hours with the Diva Cup were blissful—no leaks and I couldn’t feel a thing.  I reveled in my modern womanhood and, I’ll admit, I even looked forward to getting up close and personal with the products of my menses later when I planned to empty the cup and then dutifully reinsert it for a leak free slumber. Before I went out for the evening, I wanted to do a quick check to see if the cup was getting full.  As I searched around with digits of varying length and finally located the stem and tugged, I thought, “Hm, it’s pretty high up there!  I know it won’t get lost, but this seems like removal will be more difficult than I thought. Oh well, if worse comes to worse and I can’t get it out, it’s OK for the cup to stay in for 12 hours! Surely I’ll get it before then!”  Later that night, I got in the shower and began my first attempt at removal. Here is where the real trouble started.

As I suspected, the cup had migrated very far up my vaginal canal.  In fact, the stem seemed to be caught behind my pubic bone, and it was proving very difficult to manipulate the cup into a more unobstructed position while simultaneously trying to break the suction and pull.  I knew I hadn’t been practicing Kegels for nothing, though, and I tried to lend my fingers a hand by bearing down.  I tried not to panic each time the cup slipped from my grasp, and I made myself laugh by thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire saying “Make a pincer!” as if Pierce Brosnan and I were trying to rescue dentures from a wine glass. The cup did finally clear my pubic bone, and I was somewhat relieved despite still being unable to pull it out.  However, now I was more determined than ever to get the cup out before I got out of the shower, and I got a little overzealous with the bearing down.  Suddenly I was feeling dizzy.  It seems that my attempt at birthing the Diva Cup along with the hot steamy shower made me a little lightheaded, and I dragged myself out of the shower to get some air.  On the way, I took a knee and vomited from the dizziness, pathetically hoping that the exertion would help push the Diva Cup down.  I returned to a much cooler shower for one last attempt which of course failed.  Foolishly, I still wasn’t too worried because I would wake up for work just after the 12-hour mark.  I reasoned that by then the cup would be so full that gravity would have to work its magic.  I decided to go to sleep, hoping that the cup wouldn’t perform a disappearing act during the night.

The next morning I had a limited amount of time to excavate before work, and I wasn’t able to produce the cup from my (apparently) cavernous and many-chambered vagina.  As the hours ticked by, I began to feel anxious.  It was now a very real possibility that I would need assistance, medical or otherwise.  After work I spent over an hour locked in the bathroom poking, prodding, and, unfortunately, pinching.  My previous attempts had left my most delicate area rather irritated, and my tired fingers kept catching the swollen tissue surrounding the intruder.  With each fleeting tug of the stem, I could feel the suction deep inside of me.  It was obviously unpleasant, but what was worse for me was the idea that it would be markedly more painful once I (or whoever I recruited for the next invasion) did get a firm grip.  Finally, I admitted defeat.  I balked for a few minutes and considered that it might be time to take up crocheting again. Where did I put those hooks?  Luckily I am not quite so unstable and I decided against inserting another foreign object into my vagina.  It was time to ask for help.  I called several urgent care clinics in my area, and each one suggested that I go straight to the ER.  Being self-insured and less than amenable to paying hundreds of dollars for a hospital visit, I tried one more clinic.  The nurse I spoke to clearly didn’t hear the edge in my voice when she suggested that perhaps I should try a different clinic since all of their doctors were male.  Wouldn’t I prefer a woman? Perhaps I would if I weren’t so desperate, but I decided that it was about time that this issue was taken care of. At this point I was so embarrassed and upset that I considered going to the clinic alone.  I balked for several minutes before finally breaking down and telling my parents what was going on.  At age 26, I never expected to be asking my mother to try to retrieve an object from my vagina, but there I was.  She was more upset than I was, but she gave it a good try.  Thoroughly mortified, I decided that it was finally time to go to the clinic.  They were expecting me since I had explained my very strange problem over the phone in order to confirm that they would treat me.  I sat in the waiting room and filled out the new patient forms and tried to figure out what the visit would cost me.  

When I got into the exam room, I explained my problem to another nurse.  Surprise! She was among the converted! She proceeded to gush about her own Diva Cup and how she never wants to go back to tampons—yay for her! I conceded that yes, if the cup were not being held hostage by my vagina, it would probably be great, but I wasn’t particularly enthusiastic.  The doctor came in and seemed confident that he’d get the cup out without much trouble.  He went to the task at hand and was very kind and supportive while tearing apart my insides.  Like my many attempts to insert the cup, the doctor tried a few different methods to remove it.  First he tried using a lighted speculum and long thin forceps (apparently this is the “usual” method for situations like this).  The speculum, which is normally just uncomfortable during a run of the mill gynecological exam, was not sharing real estate well with the cup and was very pinchy.  Once the doctor got a hold of the cup with the forceps and pulled, the suction didn’t break and the pain was shockingly bad.  He tried that several times and it was terrible each time.  I was beginning to panic and begging him not to pinch my insides with the forceps.  Each time I let out a noise of pain, I apologized and he reassured me that I hadn’t done anything wrong.  The nurse looked like she was reconsidering her own love of the Diva Cup.  Then the doctor said that he would have to try to retrieve it manually.  He removed the speculum, inserted far too many fingers for my taste, and continued the quest.  I was fairly traumatized by now, and I asked if he could pop a hole in the cup to break the suction because I couldn’t stand any more pulling.  He said that was the next thing he was planning to try. This, it turned out, was the winning method.  Finally my vagina relinquished its broken and bloodied prey.  My menstrual blood splattered all over the exam table, across the floor, and on the doctor.  While he stepped out of the room to clean up, the nurse offered me wet paper towels to take care of myself and she half-heartedly dabbed at the exam table.  I apologized out of embarrassment that she had to witness that, being a cup user herself, and she shrugged and kept hopping over the blood on the floor while she was cleaning up.  She really had a winning personality.  The doctor came back into the room and wrote me a prescription for Metro Gel, a topical antibiotic to prevent infection because “there was some trauma during the removal”.  While he was writing up his report, I asked him if he had ever removed a menstrual cup before.  He said that he had, but usually they just pop out once he gets a hold of them with the forceps.  Mine, he confirmed, was the worst he’d seen, and it was the right choice to seek medical attention.  The cup had suctioned tightly around my cervix, which luckily had not been damaged in the ordeal.  

I don’t know if I will ever try a menstrual cup again.  The idea of using one is, shockingly, still enticing.  After all, it did its job well enough to keep two days worth of flow from, well, flowing.  But I can’t imagine trying one again anytime soon.  This experience was traumatic, painful, and embarrassing. Oh, and it was expensive: $45 for the cup and wash, $125 for the urgent care visit, and $26 for the prescription. Oh, and $4.99 for a new box of pads.

**TL;DR** My journey with the Diva Cup ended in the urgent care clinic...so be careful.

**Edited to add:**  I said some of this in responses below, but I wanted to make sure it was visible and clear.  It was truly not my intention to put people off of menstrual cups forever with this post, only to provide a really not great story in a sea of stories of love and devotion.  I think that some cup users have a tendency to get a bit evangelical about the things, and I understand since it seems that for the most part people have very, very positive experiences with them (or at least don't end up in urgent care and save themselves some mess with pads). It's easy for less than positive experiences to get swept under the rug in communities devoted to a particular product or philosophy.  And I appreciate people responding with their positive experiences when readers post that they will now never try one. But!  Please don't assume that I was standing in my bathroom sobbing, legs shaking like a newborn fawn while trying to insert and remove the cup.  I did follow the directions and advice about proper use, and I was not freaking out until I realized that I should probably get medical attention.  It wasn't super clear in my original post because, I'll admit, I sacrificed some of the more technical details so it would be a bit funny and readable and not-so-traumatizing, but I did try squeezing the cup before removing.  I wasn't just tugging on the stem willy-nilly.  When I initially inserted the cup, it was positioned correctly very close to my vaginal opening.  Once it had migrated upward, though, I did have to manipulate the stem a bit in order to get my fingers around the cup (like I said in the original wall of text, the stem was obstructed by the pubic bone, so I needed to move it to get my fingers further up around the cup.) Unfortunately, when I began trying to squeeze, I would hear and feel some blood rushing out of the cup, but the suction just wouldn't break completely. Even when the doctor used forceps, the suction wouldn't break, which is very unusual, so it really must have been set on there.  I'm definitely not saying that I did everything right, but I'm fairly confident that this was just a very strange series of events that led to a very bothersome conclusion (and the doctor was of the opinion that I didn't do anything wrong, even after I told him this story...with fewer Mrs. Doubtfire references).

P.S.  The nurse also said that even though my removal sounded painful, she still hates tampons enough that she'll probably keep using her cup--she did, after all, have to order it all the way from Canada!  AND my sister still plans to use hers, though she was sympathetic and slightly weary.  Apparently her canal is more akin to those of Venice and mine is a major trading conduit, but she's never had a problem and loves her Diva Cup.

1359048594.0,1027,self.TwoXChromosomes,1776eq,I'm having an abortion tomorrow and my justification is that I didn't want to get pregnant,1444,417,308,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1776eq/im_having_an_abortion_tomorrow_and_my/,"I've have seen a lot about abortion today on Reddit and it has been on my mind as I am getting one tomorrow. Because of things I have read and discussions I have had recently I just want to get this off my chest.

When the doctor asked my boyfriend and I why we had made the decision to get an abortion, even though I knew she was asking me for my own good, I couldn't help but feel annoyed at the very question.

In July I had a copper coil (IUD) fitted. I thought about it a lot, and I thought it was the best thing I could do to ensure I didn't get pregnant. Because I didn't want to get pregnant. I got the coil with its' five year lifespan and I planned to rethink whether or not it was time for children either at the end of the five years, or I could decide to have it removed earlier.

Unfortunately my coil wasn't fitted properly, and I fell pregnant. So when - having heard this whole story - the doctor asked me why, I just wanted to say ""Because I decided I didn't want to have a baby when I got the coil. Just because it failed that hasn't made a new decision for me.""

But I knew that was unfair on her, so I just told her that we didn't want children at the moment, and she accepted that and was very helpful.

I read a thread on AskReddit which was full of stories of why people were unable to bring a child into the world and that is why they felt they had to have an abortion. And I just wanted to share my story about a couple who are technically able to but choose not to bring a child into the world. That we are in love, in a stable relationship, both with excellent careers, plenty of money, a good education and a desire to start a family one day. But not now. That's why we had decided to use contraception.

I know that some women get pregnant by accident and they suddenly want that child, and that's beautiful. In fact, it's how I was born. But that isn't how we feel about this unplanned pregnancy, which we did everything we could to prevent.

So I am very sad, and very scared, and have been feeling very sick even though I am only six weeks gone. But I know this is the right thing for us. And I'm looking forward to planning a pregnancy one day. And I am thankful that it isn't that I want a child and am unable to provide for one, but that I have decided to not have children at this moment in time.

Anyone going through a similar experience my heart goes out to you. And any woman who had an experience like this change her mind and made her want to bring a child into the world - congratulations. I hope that everything will work out for all of us.

Edit: a few people have asked why I am not considering adoption (and strangely all deleted their comments) so I thought I would add my response to the original post: The reason I am not going to create a life and bring a child into the world in order to have it adopted is that there are thousands, hundreds of thousands at least, of children in the world who don't have parents. What right do I have to create another one? The world is over-populated and there are already children who need parents right now. There is no shortage of children who need to be adopted.

**Second edit:** I'm leaving for the hospital in about an hour and felt so lucky to wake up to all of these insightful comments, helpful shared experiences, and wishes of love and support. My boyfriend and I just read through all of them and were so touched by the fact that so many people have taken the time to read our story and share their thoughts and experiences.

1358140327.0,1027,self.TwoXChromosomes,16jabj,I've noticed there are a lot of questions here about pregnancy and birth control,1298,271,264,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/16jabj/ive_noticed_there_are_a_lot_of_questions_here/,"I see many posts here every day asking about pregnancy and birth control.  I thought some of you would find it helpful to have some general information about the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and birth control.

I’m a few months away from finishing my PhD in neuroendocrinology.  My thesis topic is how the menstrual cycle and hormonal birth control affect the brain and behavior.  I am also 12 weeks pregnant (on purpose, after being not pregnant for 10 years on purpose), so I have both professional and personal experience here.

I’ll start by addressing common questions, and under those I’ll give some background about how the menstrual cycle works, how pregnancy occurs, how pregnancy is detected, and finally how pregnancy is prevented. 

**Questions that I see here basically every day**

* **Am I pregnant?**

If you had sex **edited to add:** with a male-bodied person any time in the last 42 weeks, and you are female-bodied, you might be pregnant.  [Here is an honest-to-god scientific article about a girl born with NO VAGINA who got pregnant FROM ORAL SEX.](http://img2.tapuz.co.il/communafiles/21227065.pdf)  As they say in every good sex ed class and every bad one, abstinence really is the only 100% effective form of birth control.  Even used correctly, every single birth control method except abstinence has failed at least once.

So asking if there’s a chance you might be pregnant is not really a useful question.  What you want to know is how likely it is that you are pregnant.  And that depends on a number of factors.

If you want to know if you’re pregnant, take a test.  You can buy them [here for 33 cents per test.](http://www.amazon.com/Wondfo-Pregnancy-Test-Strips-25-count/dp/B0002YIQEQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358130880&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=wondfo)  If you find yourself frequently worried about pregnancy, buy these and take them whenever you’re worried.

*  **I had completely unprotected sex.  What are the chances I’m pregnant?**

The most important factor in answering this question is whether you had sex within the 5 days before you ovulated.  [Here is a chart showing the likelihood that you were in your fertile window during each day of the menstrual cycle](http://www.bmj.com/highwire/filestream/432373/field_highwire_fragment_image_l/0/F1.medium.gif) if you have no other information about when you might have ovulated.

Contrary to popular belief, if you have sex at the very beginning of your cycle or the very end, your odds of getting pregnant are almost 0.  (But they are never actually 0, see 1 above.)

*  **I have an irregular cycle/PCOS/very long periods, could I still be pregnant?**

YES.  Ovulation is harder to predict during irregular cycles, so you are MORE likely to ovulate during a time when a woman with a regular cycle would be LESS likely to.  See [this graph](http://www.bmj.com/highwire/filestream/432392/field_highwire_fragment_image_l/0/F2.medium.gif).

*  **I’m not using any regular protection, but my partner pulls out.  Could I still be pregnant?**

Withdrawal is a lot better than nothing.  [Used perfectly, it has a failure rate of 4% per year.](https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/reprints/Contraception79-407-410.pdf)  But no one’s perfect, and even if you were, yes, you could still get pregnant.

* **My partner didn't come inside me, but we did have sex for a while before putting a condom on/pulling out/not finishing.  Can I get pregnant from pre-cum?**

Some evidence suggests that there is [little to no viable sperm in pre-ejaculate](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2137833?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101528712153), and [some says the opposite](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/14647273.2010.520798).  Sometimes viable sperm can survive in the penis after ejaculation, so if you're going to do this, your partner should urinate before sex to clear any potential sperm out.  Even with this precaution, it's still possible that you could get pregnant, but it is not very likely. 

*  **I have sore breasts/fatigue/nausea/other symptoms, could I be pregnant?**

No symptom or constellation of symptoms can tell you if you are (or aren’t) pregnant.  The only way to know if you’re pregnant is to take a pregnancy test.

* **I took a pregnancy test and it was negative.  Could I still be pregnant?**

It depends on many days it has been since you ovulated.  If your period is 4 or more days late, and you are getting negative pregnancy tests, it is extremely unlikely that you are pregnant.  [Here is non-scientific data from a website that tracked how long it took women to get a positive pregnancy test.](http://www.fertilityfriend.com/Faqs/When-can-I-expect-a-positive-HPT-if-I-am-pregnant.html)  Out of 93,000 cycles (not all of them leading to pregnancy), 100% of the women who eventually tested positive for that cycle had done so by 4 days after their missed period.

If you got a negative pregnancy test but your period continues to be late, continue testing.  Since hCG increases logarithmically, if you are pregnant, a negative test will turn positive within a few days of your missed period.

* **My period is very late, but pregnancy tests all come up negative. Am I pregnant?**

It’s always possible, but if your period is more than 4 days late and you have gotten several negative tests, it’s more likely your missed period is due to some other factor.  Late or missed periods are extremely, extremely common, even in women who normally have very regular periods.  They can be caused by changes in diet, stress, exercise, travel, weight, or a number of other factors.  The sex hormones that are involved in normal menstruation and the stress hormones that get released in response to acute or chronic stressors are heavily intertwined and have important effects on each other throughout the body.  Stress is a very common cause of late or missed periods, and can also lead to failure to ovulate or to irregular, seemingly spontaneous ovulation.

Rarely, a very late or missed period can be a sign of a more serious problem, such as problems in the pelvic organs or endocrine disorders.  If you’re worried, see a doctor.

* **I missed 1 birth control pill.  What should I do?**

Your pill insert probably tells you what to do in this case.  If you’re using a combined pill (contains ethinyl estradiol), take the pill as soon as you remember.  You are just as protected as if you had taken the pill on time.  If you’re using a progesterone only pill, use a backup method until your next pill pack starts.

* **I don’t take my pill at the same time every day.  Am I going to get pregnant?**

With combined pills (contain ethinyl estradiol), the timing is less sensitive than progestin-only pills.  The half-life of estradiol is 36 +/- 13 hours.  Synthetic progestins all have different half-lives.  Norethindrone has the shortest at 7 hours.  Levonorgestrel is 36 +/- 13.  Norgestimate is 12-30 hours.  Drospirenone is 30 hours.  If you take your pill within that window for your particular progestin, you are ok.

* **I missed 2 birth control pills.  What should I do?**

Most pill inserts will recommend using a backup method.  This is a good idea no matter which 2 pills you missed.  But one thing the pill insert doesn’t explain is that *which* 2 pills you missed is very important in determining your risk of getting pregnant.

Since most pills have 7 days of placebo pills, if you miss 2 pills either immediately before or after the placebo pills, you are allowing 9 days for ovarian follicles to mature.  In some cases this is enough time for ovulation to take place, so missing those 2 pills (before or after the placebo week) is extremely risky.  

Missing 2 pills at another point in your pill pack is still not advisable, but not as risky as missing those 2 pills.

* **How soon after having unprotected sex can I take a pregnancy test?**

You can try taking one 10 days after you think you ovulated, but there is a high chance of false negatives at this point.  If you get an early negative, keep testing until you get a positive or your period.

* **Can I get my period and still be pregnant?**

Yes, many women have spotting and period-like bleeding during early pregnancy.  Some light spotting and bleeding when the egg implants is very common.  Heavy flow that looks just like a period is far less common, but it does happen during pregnancy and does not mean for sure that you aren’t pregnant.

-----------------------------
Background information
-----------------------------
**The menstrual cycle**
Each menstrual cycle begins with the first day of true bleeding, not spotting or very light flow.   Over the course of your period, your body sheds uterine lining, or endometrium, along with some blood, vaginal secretions, and cervical mucus.  This occurs for about a week, give or take a few days.

During this time, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) recruits ovarian follicles that contain eggs (ova) to mature.  FSH interacts with estrogen and luteinizing hormone (LH) to relase one (or sometimes two) mature eggs into the fallopian tubes.  This is what’s called ovulation.  Shortly before ovulation, estrogen, LH, and FSH levels rise and then quickly fall.

Endometrial lining continues to grow and thicken for about two weeks.  During this time, progesterone levels rise to their maximum and then recede.  As progesterone (and estrogen) levels drop, the body prepares to shed the uterine lining.  When levels fall low enough, your next period starts and the cycle begins again.

Everything that happens before ovulation is part of the follicular phase, and everything that happens after ovulation is the luteal phase.  In most women, the luteal phase is approximately 14 days (although it can be much longer or shorter).  So if you are trying to estimate when you are most likely to have ovulated, you probably ovulated **14 days before your next expected period.** The length of the follicular phase is less stable than the length of the luteal phase, so estimating ovulation based on your next period is more effective than estimating ovulation based on your last period.

**How pregnancy occurs**

Pregnancy occurs when a sperm meets a mature egg as it’s released from the ovarian follicle.  Although this window is fairly short (12 to 48 hours), sperm can survive for up to 5 days in the vagina under the right conditions.  The right conditions basically boils down to the quality of cervical mucus.  Some cervical mucus is thick and gluey, so it impedes sperm mobility and keeps it from reaching the egg.  Wet, slick, or egg-white textured cervical mucus provides a healthy environment for sperm to survive and swim to the egg in.  (You can learn more about cervical mucus [here](http://www.americanpregnancy.org/gettingpregnant/PECervical-mucus.html), [here](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/fam-cervical-mucus-method-22140.htm), or [here](http://www.cervicalmucus.net/).

If the sperm successfully reaches the egg, the newly made zygote moves down the fallopian tube toward the uterus and begins dividing.  This process usually takes 3-4 days.  In the uterus, it attempts to attach to the endometrial lining.  If successful, the former zygote, now embryo, will implant around 8 to 9 days after ovulation.  Around this time, trophoblastic cells in the embryo begin to secrete low levels of human chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG.  HCG levels rise very quickly during early pregnancy, doubling or tripling every 48 hours.

**How pregnancy is detected**

Pregnancy tests measure levels of hCG.  Urine tests that you take at home have a range of sensitivity.  The most sensitive tests can measure about 25 mIU (milli-international units) of hCG.  Some won’t turn positive until hCG levels reach 50 or 100 mIU.

A blood test at the doctor’s office can detect levels of hCG down to 1 mIU, but anything below 25 is generally considered inconclusive.

**How pregnancy is prevented**

There are a lot of methods to prevent pregnancy.  Hormonal methods rely on chemicals that mimic your normal menstrual cycle.  All hormonal birth control methods (every pill, the pill, the patch, NuvaRing, Implanon, the Depo shot, and to a lesser extent, Mirena IUD) contain a synthetic progesterone analog called a progestin.  Progestins bind to progesterone receptors with a much higher binding affinity than a normal progesterone molecule.  

Remember how your next menstrual cycle begins when progesterone and estrogen levels fall?  The progestins in hormonal birth control make it so that your body never got the message that progesterone levels fell.  So your next cycle never begins, your follicles don’t mature, and eggs don’t get released.  Progestins also tend to make cervical mucus less hospitable to sperm.

Most birth control pills (and some of the other hormonal birth control options) also contain a synthetic estrogen (almost always ethinyl estradiol).  This seems to suppressing the hormone cycle that ordinarily would lead to ovulation.

after i left, i called the aunt i had mentioned even though she's down south. her daughter, however, was close by, and she called her. i turned the location on my phone to find out exactly where i was and sent her the address. she was there in an hour, i packed up the essentials, and whn she got there she helped me knock out one of the windows. 

the babies and i are with her right now, and i dont want to say exactly where, but no one else knows where i am, but my cousin and aunt. i havent contacted the police because traditionally police and travellers dont get along, but i have contacted a non-traveller friend from school and he will let me stay with him. my auntie recommended a lawyer who i have an appointment with. i dont really know anything about divorce, especially divorce with violence involved, but i hope he will be able to tell me everything. i am still scared, but i feel safe now, and i know the he cant find me or our children.

thank you so much everyone, i dont think i could have done it without your kind words. i dont think i would have been able to get out without your comments and messages.

edit: thank you so much for your support. it truly means the world for me. things have been very hectic so i have been on and off. i have also read most of the comments and would like to answer some recurring questions.

many people suggested the police, and i think i need to talk about this first. travellers and coppers dont get along, and we are raised to not trust the police. i am terrified of the police. i havent gone to the doctors yet because i know they will contract the police. my auntie didnt get much help from the police when she went through it and she doesnt like them either, but she and my cousin im with are pushing me to go to hospital and maybe police. i am starting to side with the idea of going to police just to have a paper record of all this just in case, but you have to try to understand that i spent 18 years thinking the pigs were out to get me and try to take away pavee children from their families and shut our sites down, so its hard to turn to them. its a dishonour to go to the police, and travellers are supposed to settle things between travellers.

when i got to my cousin house she took pictures of my bruises. i also have some pictures i took myself and i saved texts and voicemails of him saying abusive things to me. i also have an electronic diary where i recorded a lot of what happened, i dont know if that could help. i dont have the texts from him cheating but i know the girls name. i have also turned my phone off and removed my card from it, and i remembered to clear my history and cache in my browser. my cousin and i have decided its best that i dont stay with her long, and after i meet with the lawyer and hopefully file, i will be moving in with an old school friend who agreed to let me stay with him and his sister. ive known him for many years and he has always been very understanding and caring especially considering my culture. hes a country person, and we all think its best i stay away from other travellers as much as possible.

there were also a few people who mentioned my decision to marry young and have children. i got a lot of defending, and many people hit the head on the nail. my parents are pretty liberal by our standards. i got to go to school and dated my husband for 8 months before our wedding, but its still a very strict life by settled standards. marriage is an escape from your parents house, marriage is freedom, or at least thats what we think. my family is very traditional in this respect. my mother got married at 16, my sister at 18, and everyone else in my family got married young. i have a cousin who is unmarried at 20 and people are always whispering to us. marriage young is normal for us. before we got married he was always very kind and loving, bought me lots of gifts and told me the sweetest things. i truly did believe he loved me and that he was a good man. his family has a good reputation and my older brother was even friends with him and vouched for him. he changed after i got pregnant, and then got possessive, jealous, and abusive. i dont feel like anyone should tell me i was asking for it by getting married young. i didnt know any other way of life. marriage is important because of our culture and religion, all of which most travellers take deadly seriously.

(lucky my boyfriend is on my side though).  

So I was at a family diner and my boyfriends little cousin (and her parents) were visiting the city.  It's spring and we were having the first BBQ of the season in the back yard.  My boyfriend was teaching his little cousin how to play baseball and then we had to stop to help bring out the salads etc, to the picnic table. 

 The little girl didnt like that and said ""NO!"" and swung the bat at my shin.  At my shin.  It hurt so much that I passed out for a few seconds and almost puked.  My doctor said that I received a bruised bone and a hairline fracture.  

Frankly I dont like this kid and im a bit afraid of her now lol.  I do NOT want to spend the day at a children's museum with her this weekend and neither does my boyfriend.

I'm done with the looking somewhere else and trying to not hear the conversation. I'm done with keeping my mouth shut. I'm done with trying to appear as if the subject had nothing to do with me at all. I'm done with making excuses, I'm done with swallowing it down, I'm done with listening and accepting.

I won't file a report. I won't confront the abusers, at least not in the near future. I won't pressure myself to have therapy when I know I don't want to. I won't force myself to talk about the details. I don't need all this.

I will still be careful and I won't give it as a weapon to others. I know I've collected enough supporters to fight off anyone who wants to do me harm. I'm safe and I can live with what I have to live with.

I need people to know, and I need to talk about it like the real experience it was for me. I want to talk about it like talking about the sickness or death of a loved person. I want to talk about it like a horrible car crash. I want to talk about it like it was something that happened, that I couldn't to anything about, and that was horrible.

That's it.

I know it's not much, but it's the decision I came to. And I might - I might even mention it on my blog or my social network accounts. I might even use it to silence jerks who talk shit about the things I know better because of this. I'm strong enough to take this, and I'm courageous enough to show how scared I get when I talk about it. I'm strong enough to show how weak I get when I think about it. I'm healthy enough to admit how sick it makes me.

I know this powerful feeling will be gone in a few hours, but I'm fixing it here so I can still go on with this plan. I've actually already started a few of the things I mentioned. I'm talking about the subject in general, and I'm freely telling people that my childhood wasn't great, that I've made some really bad experience, and that family members of mine have done things that would have them jailed if I could prove them. Heck, I even told my gynocologist that I've got an anxiety disorder and that he might trigger me and he understood clearly what I was talking about. So why not just call the thing by its name?

I was sexually abused, I was raped, and that's it. It's just another bad, traumatizing story like so many other people have to tell. That's me.

Thank you for reading.

Edit: Thank you all so much, I'm overwhelmed by the reactions.

Just to clarify a few things, since they have been misunderstood a few times - I won't go around babbling ""you know I was raped"" whenever I get the chance. I meant that in conversations that I usually have with others, I won't keep beating around the bush and making up excuses and euphemisms, but instead say the name of the thing.

I've been married for about three years and as of late our sex life has been next to non-existant.  I'd been recovering from about 8 months of chronic UTIs/BV/yeast infections which left me physically spent.  It had been over a year since my husband and I had sex (shoot, I just recently began using tampons again) but after much stressing about it and talking about it (and failed attempts), we had sex last night! We took it very slowly and used a looot of Astroglide (natural - no glycerin or paraben), but we were able to have sex, and it wasn't horrible! I didn't have any tearing or burning (major problem in the past), and this morning I don't feel like I have a brand new yeast infection!  In fact, my lady parts feel totally normal! I'm sorry if this is TMI, but I had to tell SOMEONE because I'm so excited!  Both my husband and I were beginning to worry if we'd ever be ""normal"" again and have an ok sex life, and last night was proof positive that we CAN get that back!  I'm not so afraid of sex now and I have a wonderful, supportive partner.

I feel like a huge weight has been lifted, and you guys are such a great support system, even though I don't know any of you!  I just needed to share :)

In the shower last night, I thought of an upside to being a Fat Girl.

There are a few girls out there who automatically dislike pretty girls. This is due to subconscious insecurity and the unconscious feeling that these pretty girls are a threat to their own self worth, femininity and attractiveness.

However, as a fat girl, I do not pose such a threat.

I am automatically non-threatening because I don’t fit standard beauty definitions of facial symmetry and low body fat percentage.

Which is an upside. I’m generally pretty shy, so I don’t need anything that prevents people from talking to me. ‘Cause god knows how unlikely it is for me to start a conversation.

Thinking about this lead me to think about what it is to be a Fat Girl in general.

Now. Don't tell me that I'm not fat.

Dude, I own mirrors. Also a scale and a tape measure if you want some empirical numbers.

I am not within the average weight range for my height, age or gender. Nor have I ever been, really.

I know that my friends who tell me I'm not fat do it because they care about me. They don't want me to feel poorly about myself and I appreciate that. But, it's a lie. And lying to me doesn't help me. Especially because knowing I'm fat doesn't make me feel bad about myself.

Because it's not necessarily a Bad Thing.

I am healthy. I can run if I have to. I enjoy the elliptical machine if I have an audiobook. I look forward to my 45 minute walk to school every morning. I love hot yoga.

But, I doubt I will ever have a flat stomach. My thighs will probably always touch. My hips will always be rounded. My arms will never be completely toned.

Maybe I don’t have enough self control.

I’ve tried diets. The low carb one worked pretty well. But I’m still trying to decide if the 10 lbs I lost were worth me coming near to tears in the grocery store because I couldn’t even find soup that didn’t have carbs. I denied myself so many simple things that made me happy.

Right now, while I’m worrying about school and my future, It’s not worth it. So, I’m not on any diet, aside from the poor student on campus budget. Maybe I’ll try again in April. But not now.

And even so, it doesn’t matter.

I may be fat, but I’m happy.

My boyfriend loves my “thick thighs” and nuzzles into my slightly pillowy stomach whenever I will let him. He still thought I was sexy when I was at my heaviest.

But more importantly, I think I’m sexy. I love my body. I like myself. My body is not just an aspect of me, it is me.

I am strong. I am sturdy. I am balanced.

I am fat.

I know this. I accept this as an objective fact. It is not a slight against my character. It does not make me less than others.

It makes me who I am. Growing up in this specific body, learning to love and accept myself as is, has given me a unique perspective on the world that no one else has.

When I say this out loud, and people tell me that I’m not fat, it takes a bit of that journey away from me.

I know exactly who and what I am, and it took me a long time to get here.

I am a Fat Girl. But that does not mean that I cannot also be a Pretty Girl.

EDIT: Holy balls. I put this up just so I didn't feel so much like I was talking to myself, and it blew up while I was at work!

This was originally posted on my tumblr and it was mostly ignored because no one follows me. (HIGHLY NSFW. SERIOUSLY I POST PORN SOMETIMES) http://embersinmyeyes.tumblr.com/

I love this community. Everyone is so supportive and loving and wonderful. Thank you so much to /u/DylanMcDermott who bought me some reddit gold! &lt;3 It's really cool actually! &lt;3

To the people who don't feel so great about their looks: you're beautiful. No matter what you look like, I'm willing to bet money that there's something about you that another person would kill for.

It took me a while to figure out how I could be happy. And it mostly involves mentally telling the people who put me down to go fuck themselves with a cactus.

And I want to be clear that I am all for dieting and exercising and all that wonderful weight loss stuff, as long as it makes you happy. I know a lot of people who get extreme joy out of the time they spend working on their bodies, and all power to 'em! 

My comment was simply that it did not make me happy. So much so that dieting actually brought me legitimate despair.

I don't overeat, aside from the odd celebratory buffet after a semester ends. I eat healthy foods. I don't drink Coke anymore or other sugary drinks since I discovered tea. I get at least 45 minutes of some kind of exercise on most days. The issue with me is that I got fat as a child. My parents didn't really stop me when I wanted 2 Hungry Man dinners for lunch (900 calories each, by the way). I got fat long before I realized how terrible it could be for me.

So at this point, my exercise and eating habits mean I maintain my current weight without much consideration. It's the loss of weight that is hard for me. That's where I begin to feel like I'm no longer enjoying my life.

'Cause that's all I want. I want to be happy. And hardcore keto diets do not make me happy.   

The TwoX community makes me happy. I love the discussions here and the kindness. I don't see as much kindness in the world as I'd like to, except when I'm here.

Plus, I've only been called a cunt once this whole thread! Which is nice. Because I mean, who doesn't like vaginas? Cunts are all about depth, warmth, fun and life!

1360065398.0,1010,self.TwoXChromosomes,17xfwt,My husband just ran away from home an hour ago,1346,336,424,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/17xfwt/my_husband_just_ran_away_from_home_an_hour_ago/,"We've been married 17 years, have raised 2 kids together, our youngest is 15. He told me a couple of weeks ago that he'd met a girl. They hadn't had sex and he'd cut off contact with her but couldn't get her out of his mind. Turns out she's that same age as our daughter-in-law and works as a stripper. He'd started going to strip clubs over the holidays without mentioning it to me. He's turning 39 in a few months so I assumed it was just midlife talking (ha ""just""). He even agreed with me and did a lot of reading on the subject.

He couldn't make up his mind to give up the idea of building a life with this girl he hardly knew and had never even seen with her clothes on. Apparently the fact that he'd already built a life with me just wasn't on his radar. Dont get me wrong, he felt terribly guilty. He was going on crying jags, he started taking Xanax for panic attacks. He couldn't get the idea that maybe she was his last chance for happiness out of his mind. We both have appointments with a psychiatrist, but she couldn't fit us in until next month.

Last night I told him I was starting to think about asking him to move out, but was going to hold off on making a decision until we'd talked to a counselor. He freaked out, told our daughter he was leaving, then changed his mind and spent the night on the sofa instead. He told me he'd come in and say goodbye before he left for work. I woke up to the sound of him pulling out of the driveway at 4:30 in the morning. We exchanged a couple of texts. He apologized, I let him know he was welcome to come back if he needed to and told him to take care of himself. Then I cried a lot and alternated between punching his side of the bed and stroking it tenderly (so I lost my mind for a bit). When my daughter wakes up I'll have to be more sane.

So here I am, can't sleep, can't think, hoping for some human contact.

TLDR: He gone.

EDIT: Sorry I can't respond to each of you please know I'm reading it all.
He fainted in a public place and I got a text from him from the emergency room. I offered to come and he said he wanted me there. Turns out he was planning to leave, but now he wants to stay. We're going to put limits on what we talk about for awhile to let things cool down. We're going to a psychologist because she was recommended by a friend, takes our insurance, and we both want an experienced hand guiding our medications.

about him: He's been a great guy, loving, patient, supportive. I think his drive to try to be the ""perfect"" husband is a large part of the problem. I think it's very unlikely that he's doing drugs. He's even been extra careful about his alcohol consumption. He admits his problems started around the time of my last post a year and a half ago. He's apologized for not seeking treatment for his depression at the time.

about me: I don't work. I developed health problems more than a decade ago that precluded me working. I'm actually doing a lot better now, but my skills are way out of date. I'm planning on going to community college and get back to work.

open marriage: I'm actually not opposed to the idea in principle. The problem right now is that he isn't interested in sex with me. I'm afraid if he starts having sex with young girls he'll never want to come back to my post-menopausal and two damned big babies body. If our sex life was in working order I'd definitely be open to the discussion. As it is now I'm concerned it might just be the death of our marriage altogether. Also there's the problem of his attachment to this one particular girl. It's not just sex he's fantasizing about, it's a whole new life without me in it.

I am by nature a calm and rational person. All this chaos is definitely throwing some hard body blows to my self-image and sense of balance though. I'm upping the yoga and meditation components of my daily life in an attempt to bring myself back to center. Thanks again to everyone for taking the time to try and help this total stranger.

EDIT AGAIN: Sorry forgot to explain about the girl. The last time he went to the club it was specifically to see her. They exchanged phone numbers. She texted him she didn't want to see him at the club anymore, she wanted to go out on a real date. He told her he was married and needed to stop talking with her. She texted him again 2 weeks later and he reiterated that he couldn't communicate with her ""as long as he was trying to work on his marriage"" Less than ideal, but he's really trying and I appreciate the effort involved.",,False,,t5_2r2jt,1360108671.0,,,True,t3_17xfwt,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/17xfwt/my_husband_just_ran_away_from_home_an_hour_ago/,

She was probably in her 60's or so, but you could clearly tell she was not the typical type of person you would encounter at a planned parenthood.  So, hearing all of these horror stories of older women getting mad at younger women for taking the pill I was just expecting some kind of nasty remark to be made towards me when suddenly the old woman stops me and asks me, ""Are those birth control pills?"", and I just responded, ""yes they are.""  And here I thought the bashing would come, but instead she lifts up her hand and offers me a high five.  ""Responsibility is hard to come by these days!"" and then she smiled.  She gave me a pat on the back and walked on her way inside. We can't always blame the older generation for hating birth control, and from this I definitely walked home feeling better about society :).

I'm just surprised they didn't stoop to ""starts cat fight."" It wouldn't be that far out of the norm for Yahoo Shine.

ANYWAY here's what Tina Fey said at the awards show:

&gt;After Lena Dunham thanked Tina Fey and Amy Poehler for “getting her through middle school,” in her acceptance speech for best comedic actress, Fey and Poehler made light of being older than Dunham, acting like they were drinking away their sorrows.

&gt;Perhaps playing on the jealous of the successful younger woman trope, **Fey said, “You know what Taylor Swift? You stay away from Michael J. Fox’s son,”** mocking Swift’s many high-profile relationships and the confessional songs that result. 

&gt;That’s it. That’s all she said. Well, actually, **she added, “No, she needs some me time to learn about herself.”** That was the extent of the Taylor Swift mock-a-thon.

In her latest Vanity Fair interview, Swift said: 

&gt;In an profile in this month’s Vanity Fair, Swift said Tina Fey and Amy Poehler’s Golden Globes comedy routine **making fun of her love life made them “mean girls,” in her eyes**, and using a quote Katie Couric gave her, said, **“There’s a special place in hell reserved for women who don’t help other women.”**

I think it's pretty obvious that if you make a public career by singing about your relationships, you've made yourself open for a gentle joke at an awards show. And it *was* a GENTLE joke. I'm not saying public figures are open for mean spirited and hateful jokes, or sexist or racist jokes, but public figures *are* open for light hearted jokes. It comes with the territory - and the millions of dollars that they get from having a PUBLIC persona. 

But what do you think? Did that joke make Tina Fey a ""mean girl""? Or is Taylor Swift overreacting? ",,False,,t5_2r2jt,False,,,True,t3_19pz8a,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/19pz8a/taylor_swift_calls_tina_fey_and_amy_poehler_mean/,

I do stuff right: I stay alert when I'm out, no headphones, lock my door at all times, etc.

But last night caught me unprepared. At 2am, I woke up to loud rapping on my front door. The knocker identified himself as police. I looked through the peephole to verify and couldn't see anyone, which I told him. He moved to stand more squarely in front of the door, but it was hard for me to make out what he was actually wearing. What I would have liked to do was call 911 and verify that there were, in fact, police officers standing outside my door, but every 10 seconds or so, they'd knock loudly again and yell at me that ""[they were] not going away,"" and that someone had called them about an incident in my apartment.

The high urgency of the knocking and yelling stressed me out, and I was starting to make out a badge on one of them (but you could probably get a dollar store badge to pass as real, with my shitty vision!), so I let them in. They really were police officers and they were investigating a fight in my building that someone had mistakenly identified as coming from my unit.

So some questions: (1) Am I completely nuts for not wanting to let them in? (2) What do I do next time? (3) How do I get them to chill out while I call a dispatcher and make sure they are who they say they are? Because it really doesn't seem right to open my door to every stranger who tells me to at 2am, especially in my neighborhood...

**Edit: THANKS EVERYONE. I feel so much better -- truly! The police seemed really irritated that I held out on answering the door, but it's a relief to feel totally justified in my hesitation and instinct to call a 911 operator first. Hopefully it won't happen again, but next time I should be able to handle it much more calmly. Yay!**

**My landlord just called to update me on the incident as well (I contacted her to let her know there was a fight and cops were called). She said that an abusive boyfriend had been arrested and that the tenant had said that he wouldn't be coming back.

""So the picture floating around saying ""Save the girls, stop abortion""...
If you plan on reposting or ""liking"" that picture, de-friend me right now.
You don't know why anyone would have an abortion, I get that.
You don't believe in it for various reasons, okay.

But posting a picture of a fetus at what appears to be maybe 3 months is disturbing, offensive and I do not want to see it.

I sat out of class the day they showed fetuses on jars in health class because I do not want to see that.

Unless you have ever been in the position to have to make such a difficult choice, you need to stop forcing others to try to think like you.

I don't see many pro-choicers posting pictures saying ""Have an abortion!"" ... I see them saying, hey, sometimes life gives you a situation that is difficult, horrifying or terrible and you should be allowed to make a choice as to what you are going to do with your body. 

Unless you've been raped you will NEVER understand the psychologically and physical effects of that trauma. Never.
You can't even pretend to understand what someone goes through on a daily basis.
You will never know what it is like to sleep with the lights on because sleeping in the dark gives you panic attacks or nightmares.
Or what it's like to sleep in running shoes.
Or how it feels to keep a knife under your pillow because it's the only way you feel safe enough to sleep.

How about you post or like a picture that says ""Stop rape""? Or is that a little too uncomfortable for you to think about? 

Seriously. This is your chance. Remove me from your friends list. Tell me or don't. ""

You know how disgusted girls get by creepy crawly things."" This really pissed me off and I was about to make a retort, but my friend just calmly turned to the guy and told him. ""Not with her, in fact, I had her teach me her technique for cleaning fish last year because it was a quicker and more effecient way of doing it. And by the way, you might not want to piss her off, she is a much better shot than I as well."" Then turned back to me and and began talking about the trip again. The guy was flabbergasted.

Let’s do the back-story first. All of my life, my father has been emotionally abusive. When he and my mother were still married, he mainly directed it towards her. When they divorced, my older sister got the brunt of it. After he kicked my older sister out, he then directed it towards me. For years. I spent years living with him. He spent years tearing me down. I am not going to get into details, suffice to say that when I finally was able to move in with my mum at the age of 16, I was pretty messed up. I didn’t end my relationship with him until I was 19. I did so by moving across the country. I cut him out of my life. It was glorious. For 5 years now, I’ve been living a very peaceful life with great friends, a wonderful life, and a loving partner. 

Yesterday, my father called me. I didn't know he had my cell phone number. During our conversation, he pulled out some of the same tricks he’s always used, but to a lesser extent. The conversation left me feeling boggled, upset, and fuzzy for about 24 hours. That’s when I decided that I had had enough of this. I called him back today and I told him that if he is so intent on cultivating a relationship with me that there are rules he needs to follow. I then laid out my rules. They were pertaining to certain behaviors that he has/had. I essentially told him that he had better smarten the fuck up, because a relationship with me was earned, not deserved. Then I told him to think about it, come to a decision, and let me know.

It was the best moment of my adult life. 

Note: Please don’t blame my mother for leaving me with my father. She was a single mother, trying to support my four older siblings (two of which had serious drug problems and had been kicked out of my father’s house), and she collected me as soon as she could. When I went to live with her, there were 6 of us living in a 2-bedroom house. She did the best she could at the time with the resources she had. I love her so much and am so grateful to have her in my life. 

Thanks for reading. I just really needed to get this all out.


Edit: I am absolutely floored with the support that this community has given me. I can’t even begin to tell you all what your words of encouragement mean to me. Thank you so much. 

I am also saddened by how many of you have to suffer through abusive relationships as well. When the time is right, I know that you are all strong enough to do what you have to do to get to a safe place in your life.

I was in for a much weirder situation. 

I found it easily enough without having to ask anyone where they were, and headed to the cashier line with just that one item. I put the Diva Cup on the belt and waited for the guy in front of me to finish. The cashier was a pretty, young girl and I imagined she knew of the Diva Cup and might even tell me how much she loves it. Imaginary conversations are the best. :) 

Once the man in front of me was gone, the cashier scanned my item and set it on the check writing platform in front of me. I began digging for my credit card which was not in my wallet as I expected, but somewhere in the damn Null Void of my purse. 

As I was spelunking the caverns of my purse, the cashier picked up the Diva Cup box and asked, ""Do these smell good, what flavor is it?"" She then brought the fucking thing to her nose and took a big ol' whiff. 

What the actual fuck. 

I could not believe that was happening to me right then. I just stared at her in shock and finally said ""I....That's... not what that is."" I couldn't think of anything else to help the situation and just allowed her to figure it out on her own as I found my card and swiped it. She slowly turned the box in her hand reading the info, and I assume she got to the diagrams when the realization swept over her face. ""Oh. Oh my god.....I'm sorry. I...a woman came in earlier with a plug-in scent thing and the box looked really similar."" My face was burning. Of all the things that could have happened during this quick shopping trip, someone sniffing my Diva Cup was a situation I definitely had not imagined.

I feel that I need to share my piece, and if the mods feel that this is inappropriate or insufficiently ""woman-focused"", then they can use the control that they have to deal with it accordingly.

About a month ago, I broke up with an emotionally abusive boyfriend that I had been with for almost 2 years. In the last few months of the relationship, I had reached out to the 2X community for advice, support, and help as I made the ultimate decision to end our relationship and move on into a healthier and safer chapter in my life.

One of the lingering ""symptoms"" of emotional abuse victimhood (or survivorhood) is the fear of expressing oneself for fear of retribution. As a result, such survivors can be hesitant to criticize, express an opinion, or step forward, metaphorically speaking. In my case, my SO was someone with a serious anger problem, who frequently took it out on doors, walls, and other inanimate objects. His trigger could be virtually anything, and so I became fearful to express *anything* to him.

It's only been a month, and I'm getting a little better day by day, but reading these new rules and restrictions on what we are and are not permitted to post feels like, in a way, I'm listening to him give me his house rules all over again. God forbid we step out of line, lest our post be vaporized without appeal. It feels like intimidation, and bullying.

I want to know that, if creating a rage comic is the best way I can find to express something that I experienced or that I'm feeling, I can do so without being shunned for it. I want to know that if what I post is of little or no value, it will be downvoted, not deleted. I want to know that I have a right to post things that I think the community will appreciate, without having to go through a massive checklist of criteria to ensure it's ""appropriate.""

The fact is, we have plenty of posts here that relate to women trying to express themselves, or gain some more power in their lives. What kind of a message does it send to this community when the Moderators bring in these sweeping changes with no input from the community? To me, it says that we have no power, and that it's not really ""our"" community. It's theirs, and we're just here until they decide we're no longer contributing.

I know this got a little rant-y. I'm not going to apologize for that. I just hope I'm not the only one who feels this way.

**Edit:** I just wanted to say how proud I am of the civilized discourse and debate that's happening here and on the moderators' thread. This kind of conversation is what separates us from 4chan, Fark and all the others. I also wanted to say briefly that if this kind of conversation had taken place as a result of *proposed* rules (as opposed to *announced* rules, I suppose), I suspect there would be a much healthier and more positive emotional environment here right now.

Two years ago I found joy in being an inspiring role model to other girls, going out on my own, living an active lifestyle, participating in activities and events happening all over this beautiful City.  I lived alone, I used public transit and I walked as much as I could.  Two years ago I loved the freedom I had to be able to spontaneously meet a friend on another side of the city and I could find my way there without fear.  Two years ago I was a cheerful and optimistic girl who smiled at strangers when I passed them in the street.  Two years ago I spent a summer day and evening with my family and friends, and I felt overwhelmed with how beautiful and wonderful my life was.  

Two years ago I was raped, and for two years I've been fighting like hell to get that girl back.
My faith in others was destroyed, and I silently condemned every man I didn't know, as I automatically assumed that their only intention was to harm me.  I felt unreasonable revulsion for individuals who looked like my rapist and I sickened myself with those sad and angry feelings, because I never thought that I could become a person so full of fear and hatred.  The feelings of violation and mistrust were also forced into my sisters lives and that breaks my heart.  I have always tried to teach those girls to embrace life and to live with an independence and strength that comes from within, no matter how scary the world seems.  Now, they live so afraid that this will happen to them, and I fear that their lives have been stunted by one person who chose to commit a hateful and disgusting act of violence against me.  

I spent night after night, unable to sleep; plagued by nightmares replaying what had happened to me.  The incessantly nagging feelings compelled me to leap out of bed to check every lock on every door and window three times over.  I searched every nook and cranny in every room for the phantom intruders that haunted my nightmares.  I stopped myself from leaving my apartment after dark.  Where ever I went, I jumped at every little sound or movement behind me, and was immediately filled with nausea remembering those moments of utter terror.  No one should ever have to beg for their life the way I did, and to be made to do every horrible thing that I was told to do, so that I wouldn’t die.  

The only way that I can make those memories stop, is when I focus on what I've done in the past two years to STAY alive.  For two years, I've worked to regain the spirit and inner strength that was broken.  I could have buried my soul away after that night.  My spirit could have been lost and never found, but I didn't bury it.  I picked it up all battered and bruised and instead of hiding it away, I raised it up in my hands for all to witness.  I said “SEE THIS?  Do you see this ugly thing, all tattered and bloody?  It was mine, and what was once so effervescent and full of life is damaged and it’s hurting… it’s dying.  What do I do with it now?”
And they answered, my loved ones, who looked upon that poor pathetic spirit of mine in it’s most wounded and wretched state.  They answered, with voices loud and full of promise they said “we see it, we cherish it and we will hold it for you until you're ready”.

Today.  
I am ready.
She’s back, she’s here in this room, and she’s got more strength and power than ever before.  
Today I took my soul back and it’s saturated with the force of a hundred hearts and minds that stand with me.  With this strength I'll finally sleep soundly and undisturbed all night.  I will travel free on my way without fear of what or who could be lurking around a corner or a bush or a tree.  I won't jump at sounds or footsteps behind me, and I'll smile at strangers again, without holding contempt for those I do not recognize.
  
My intuition is renewed, and my words are powerful.  
I exist in this moment; grounded and full of courage. 
 
Two years ago I was raped.
And today; I am a survivor.

I wore [a flowing skirt of mismatched silk, clearly made for hippies.](http://imgur.com/hUzbiGI)  I bought it on a whim for $15.  I wore my hair up in a high bun the way my fiance doesn't like but I've always loved since I was a girl and worshipped ballerinas.  I cinched up one of my new belts around my ""itty bitty waist"" (I'm a plus sized girl, so this is new terminology for me).  I put on some makeup that I find flatters my skin and eye shape and color (thanks so much /r/makeupaddiction), and walked out the door with confidence.  To the MALL. 

[A year ago](http://imgur.com/wvlFdc3) I could [never have done this](http://imgur.com/WhyZ03m).  I tended to [hate every inch of my body, as long as I can remember.](http://imgur.com/DZYaQfz)  To be fair, that hatred is not exactly extinct.  But ever since [finding my wedding dress](http://i.imgur.com/NBwIk.jpg) in January, I've been realizing just how much there is to love about my body.  

Today, I wore the clothes that I love the most.  I said ""fuck you"" to all the voices in my head screaming that I was going to be judged, judged, JUDGED for wearing them.  And what happened?  

Compliments.  Tons of compliments.  I wasn't invisible like I was a year ago.  I strutted around and didn't even worry about it, but everywhere I went I got compliments.  I gave up all the fucks I've been holding on to so dearly.  If I want to wear a god damn hippy skirt because I think I look awesome in it, I'm fucking going to.  And YOU'RE going to probably LIKE it.  But if you don't, I don't give a SHIT.  

Now THERE'S some progress.

I've been lurking for awhile here, really loved the community, and thought I'd work up the courage to post something that's really been bothering me.

This is sort of a problem that just started happening but I don't know if I'm making a big deal out of it or I should just let this slide.

I live at college (I'm a 20 year old Indian girl) and over the summer I come home. Recently, these past few weeks, my dad can't keep his eyes off me. It's really, really disturbing and I keep trying to avoid it, but when I talk to him, I catch him staring at my chest obviously and then quickly looking up to meet my eyes.

I'm not the kind of girl to wear tank tops all the time, and I usually wear shirts. He still stares.


I came home last night after going out for dinner with a few friends and I was wearing kind of a low cut dress. He got mad at me (when I came home) and told me to stand in front of him so he could see what I was wearing. I felt incredibly uneasy and sat right back down. The rest of the night I caught him staring at my chest every so often.

It took a lot of courage to tell my mom about this and she just completely dismissed me, saying my dad is not like that, and I was being 'self centered' and that I 'need to get over myself'. I don't know how to bring this up or deal with this situation AT ALL. :'( Please help me, friends.

**edit:** I decided that I needed to take action. This morning I was making breakfast and my little brother told me that my dad was blatantly staring at my ass for a long twenty minutes (he was in the dining room and I was in the kitchen, so I didn't notice, I thought he was just drinking coffee and watching the news). I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable at home so I'm going to write a note, pack a few things, and live for the rest of the summer on campus with my best friend. Here's my letter http://i.imgur.com/let11I6.jpg

Please wish me luck...I've never done anything like this and I'm scared hell is going to break lose once he gets home from work. Haven't told my mom yet....I'll tell you guys what she says once I'm done packing.

1363881774.0,962,self.TwoXChromosomes,1aql1b,"After months of trying to figure out why my bf doesn't ""go down"", I finally got the reason: ""I don't do that because eating p*ssy makes you a bitch"". [rant]",1324,362,583,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1aql1b/after_months_of_trying_to_figure_out_why_my_bf/,"Yes. That's right. Apparently, ""eating pussy makes you a bitch"".

Some backstory: I've (I'm 27) been dating this guy (he is 35) since August, and it started out as a hookup that turned into more. Not an ideal situation, but it is what it is. At first, sex was frequent and vigorous. I overlooked his unwillingness to go down as something he didn't wanna do until we dated awhile. I get that. (All the while I was asked to and happily gave lots of bj's, of course.) The more our relationship has progressed, the less sex we've had. Normally I could attribute this to our long work hours (he is a chef) and a bit of slowing down of the sex drive as the newness of a relationship wears off. But now, it's gotten to where we've had sex once in three weeks. I have been and always will be a horndog. I could have sex 5 or 6 times a week, if given my choice. So with a dry spell like this...I am terribly unsatisfied. I'm questioning everything, am I not pretty enough anymore? Is he unattracted to me? What could I do to fix this? Why am I not good enough? Have I gotten too fat? Should I start a starvation diet?

I have tried talking to him about these things, tried telling him I need more affection. I could do without the sex so much if he would just be physically affectionate, random kisses here or there, holding my hand, touching me at all. I get it that everyone has different levels of affection they feel comfortable with, and even though all my previous relationships have included a lot more physical expressions of affection, I'm willing to bend and compromise, you know? But I feel like I'm in a desert, starving to death, desperate for any pathetic dribbles of sandy water I might be able to eek out of a deep hole. Trying in a diplomatic way to say ""hey, babe, these things are what I need to make me feel better about our relationship"" hasn't worked.

When we do have sex, I NEVER have an orgasm. And I mean never, not once in 6 months. He was under the impression that MOST women can cum from penetrative sex, and was incredulous when I told him otherwise. And to you sisters out there who can, bless you for the gods have smiled kindly upon you. But for poor saps like me, I've gotta have some...clitoral stimulation...for me to ""get there"". He doesn't wanna touch me to make me cum, and he doesn't really even try to kiss me, caress me, etc when I try to get myself there. This lack of interest makes me feel totally unsexy and insecure, so much so that most of the time I can't even get off in front of him because...well, he doesn't give a shit it seems like and my body just can't let go. 

Regarding oral, I have practically BEGGED him to do it for me, even just once in awhile. And he made a pathetic half assed attempt once when drunk, to no real effect. This kills me. Every and I mean EVERY other relationship I've had my partner has been willing and (gasp!) eager to do this for me. Not only because they like it but because they knew that doing so would not only get me all primed and ready physically, but because I would be really turned on and ready to then rock their world. But not this guy. I've tried to make him understand I can't cum without some kind of stimulation beyond just fucking...to no avail. And I'm starting to get rather bitter.

So: last night after a few beers I finally dragged it out of him. I asked ""Babe, why don't you go down on me? Am I gross? Do I smell or taste bad? Do out think my pussy is ugly?"" After some prodding, out it comes: ""Pretty much my boys always told me, eating pussy makes you a bitch. And I'm not a bitch, I just won't do it"".

Shock. And. Awe. What the fuck kind of twisted pathetic concept of masculinity is THAT?! Oh really, your boys are in the bedroom with you? You being totally selfish and self absorbed in the bedroom makes you a man? Leaving your girl so patently unsatisfied that she often fantasizes about other men makes you a man? Never making your girl cum means you're a badass? What the actual fuck. 

Then he says ""plus, I'd like something to make it more fun for me, chocolate sauce or something"". Now don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to some playful things like that in the bedroom, but after his initial statement, that just reinforced that I am not good enough the way I am. The vagina is gross, a thing to be feared, a dirty thing that causes men to become ""bitches"" if they kiss it. It's just so far beyond the pale, that pathetic reasoning.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not in favor of forcing someone to do something sexually they don't wanna do. But I'm also not in favor of feeling like I have some sort of evil inducing axe wound. Not in favor of being required to what I feel like amounts to ""putting out and shutting up"". On the one hand, I am so angry. I'm a highly educated female with strong feminist tendencies. Why the fuck am I putting up with this nonsense? On the other hand, I feel ugly, lame, gross, unsexy, unwanted, and unworthy. I feel crazy for putting up with this. I really like this guy, and all our friendships are enmeshed, and I don't really want to lose him. But how the fuck can I stand to be in a relationship where my femininity and needs as a woman and as a person are not only neglected, but disrespected?

What the hell do I do about this, ladies (and gentlemen) of 2X? Am I the crazy one? Are vaginas really that disgusting? Is affection so unthinkable? Please give me some feedback, I'm running in mental circles here. 

**edit** Thanks for the response guys!! I really appreciate all your comments and tried to reply to as many as I could. I very much appreciate both your understanding and your (brutal) honesty. I have to get ready for work, but I will definitely be thinking about your advice today and in the days to come. Ill keep you posted. &lt;3

",1328,378,357,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/19071u/im_tired_of_being_accused_of_victim_blaming_for/,"Let me start by saying that I was violently raped last year. It was one of the most horrific experiences of my life. As such, I think it's VERY important that we continue to raise awareness for people, especially young girls, to be able to protect themselves. 

I understand the important of not victim blaming. I personally understand how detrimental it is to a victim to be blamed for their rape. Having said that, I'm tired of being accused of ""victim blaming"" for giving practical advice. 

I keep seeing things like ""Don't teach women not to go out alone at night, teach rapists not to rape""

To me, this sounds like ""Don't teach women to take their safety into their own hands. Leave their safety in the hands of rapists""

Or, I see ""how to prevent rape"" lists, with things like ""if a woman is doing her laundry alone at night, don't rape her""

Rapists are rapists for a reason. They're not good, reasonable people. You have to protect yourself from them, because they're not going to protect you from themselves. When you are being attacked, you can't say 'excuse me, I have a right to be in this laundry room alone at night, and you don't have the right to rape me' and expect them to say ""oh that's right, I'm sorry"" and leave you alone. 

I hope and pray for a world where women can freely walk down the streets at any hour of the night, or go to a party and drink what she wants, or go on a date with a stranger without the risk of being raped. But that's not the case and I wish people would stop pretending like women don't have to take ACTIVE steps to protect themselves. 

Telling a woman not to walk alone at night is not victim blaming. It's rapist blaming. I don't say to my friends ""try not to walk alone at night unless you have to, in which case carry pepper spray"" because I think ""if a woman walks alone at night she deserves to be raped"". Rather, I say it because I don't think women should trust that rapists with their safety. 

I know being raped wasn't my fault. But I also acknowledge that there were many things that I could've done to protect myself from an evil person, that I never really thought of. I don't think sharing those tips and ideas with other women should be called ""victim blaming"". 


***Edit: I'm not saying all rapes happen at night when a woman is walking alone. I'm giving a basic example**

I thought maybe it could also serve as entertainment for anyone that wasn't there to actually witness the sabotage. 


On like my third date with this guy, while we were eating dinner, he mentioned that he had this family party Up North, none of his friends could go camping with him, but he really wanted to go. I offered to go with him because I love camping.


Camping was our fourth date. I went over to his house the night before, we had a nice night of grocery shopping, beer drinking, I gave him a rocking BJ (NSFW sorry but that's the only horn I can toot during this story, lol). 

We wake up. I go to put my contact in and realize the hydrogen peroxide solution has not neutralized yet and started screaming in pain in his bathroom. I honestly could not stop wailing it hurt so badly. He was kind of shocked by the noises coming from the bathroom, but my eyeball was in pain. I came out of the bathroom with a swollen eye, and that's pretty much how I looked about 75% of the trip. So he could barely look at me in the eye out of mere disgust.

BUT...I will hold my head up high because I'm on vacation damn it. And I'm going to have fun.


That night we had a camp fire, talked about family and careers and yatta yatta. I was happy because it was finally dark and harder to tell that I looked like Quasimodo with my swollen eye. The evening was great, we had sex for the first time, woke up the next morning cuddling. My eye is still kinda red, but it's fading and I'm thinking ""perfect...the last 24hrs of this camping trip I'll be sun tan, my eye will look normal, I'll be able to wear contacts and put makeup on and leave him looking like the bomb shell that I am.""

So we're drinking our morning bloody Marys... have a couple beers as we sit in the sun, and I get dolled up for his family party. I wore a red dress and did my hair and make up, didn't have a Quasimodo eye anymore, and we go to the family party. I say hi and everyone's really excited to meet me. I sat in the sun with his sister and his mother. I think it was at this point that I forgot that I had been drinking with him all morning.


This is a dry party by the way, so we brought beer in the cooler and drank it in secret. The rest of his family had the same idea. So I was invited by the mother of this gentleman at a certain point to go for a ""walk."" As an Irish Catholic woman, I know what that means, so I follow her. She makes me a drink with some kind of pop and liquor--I usually don't drink liquor because nothing good ever happens but, hey, what the hell, I'm on vacation damn it! 

We're all talking in the circle, sitting in the sun. Time is passing and I'm not really noticing. His sister gets up to leave and asks us to go on a walk with her and her husband, so I gladly accept. She pulls out a joint and I'm like ""fucking sweet...I'm on vacation and this dry family party is way more fun than I thought it was going to be...""

....that right there is maybe the last thing I remember thinking until waking up the next morning.

I didn't think about what I didn't remember the next morning because I woke up feeling refreshed and frisky and excited that I was still on vacation! He wasn't as frisky as I was, but I'm on vacation damn it! I'm gonna have some fun! I clearly need to realize that there is some type of reality that does in fact exist during vacation because while I was on top of him, he literally took me and put me back down on the bed. This was extremely confusing because I'm rarely turned down from sex after getting on top of a naked man and straddling him while he has a boner. He got up, got dressed, and just started making breakfast silently.

I wake up, realize my eye kind of burns, go to reach for the hand mirror in my purse so I can subtly make sure my Quasimodo eye isn't back, and realize my purse is nowhere.

As I'm trying to remember where my purse is, frantically looking through his truck, I'm realizing (1) Quasimodo is back, and (2) I do not remember the ride home last night. 

While making phone calls to his family in hopes to find my purse, he's still not really talking to me. I ask if he was mad/disappointed/annoyed with me, all of which were answered ""no."" I asked if I was embarrassingly drunk and he told me I was just drunk. I found out later that the reason we had to leave was because I let the dog out after distinctly being asked not to. This happened three times. The thought in my head was ""fuck, there was a dog there?"". The third time I let the dog out, it got into a fight with a cat, and according to him, that was our queue to leave. (I have confirmed that both the dog and the cat were not injured. I may have blacked out at a dry party for a family I have not met, but I do have a heart.)

I got into a fight with his cousin Dave (I have no idea what Dave looks like by the way--don't remember meeting him. I don't remember meeting half of the family actually. I remember no names. I barely remember what his father looked like). Apparently Dave started talking about how women in the Upper Penninsula are ugly, and I was sincerely offended and sad and angry that he said that. And I gave Dave my two cents.

His mother asked if I wanted another drink and apparently I laughed in her face as I declined thinking it was a funny question. I imagine I looked kind of like [this](http://i.imgur.com/gkTWd0n.png). 

I learned all of this in the five hours we had to drive home. It was so overwhelming that I started losing the ability to keep my responses polite. For instance, he found a condom wrapper in his pocket.

Me: ""Shit, we had sex last night too?""

Him: ""You don't remember that either do you""

Me: ""Fuck...sorry""

Him: ""................""

Me: ""Was it good sex?""

Him: ""Not really...it was just drunk sex.""

Me: ""Damn it well can I get a play by play? What positions did we do it in?""


Yeah, he wasn't interested in giving me a play by play and wasn't amused that I was too drunk to remember. He also wasn't too amused by my self loathing on the way home. I cracked jokes like, ""Well thank god we met randomly in a sushi bar so I can just disappear. That would have sucked if I met you through someone at work or something."" Yeah... I would no longer see that cute smile of his because he was not smiling. at all really. 

What I learned about myself is even if I'm black out drunk, I can still make a rocking fire. Also, that I will stand up for women from Northern Michigan even when I'm plastered. I also learned that his sister smokes dank weed.

**TLDR: Got black out drunk at a dry high school graduation party while meeting this cute dude's family for the first time, almost got his family's dog injured by a cat, offended multiple family members whom I don't remember even meeting, lost my purse, all whilst looking like Quasimodo with a big fat red eye.**

And that's how you lose a guy during a 48hr camping excursion.

*EDIT: To provide context, we're both 25-year-old successful young professionals. I have nothing bad to say about this dude because he lived the rest of the trip out like a gentleman. Who wouldn't be mad at a date for doing this? To all of you willing to laugh with/at me, thanks. It helps ease the pain. lol. To all of you who think I fucked up--yep. Yep. I don't really have much to say in addition. It's day 4 after this and I'm still in disbelief. I'm having dreams at night of getting the chance to apologize to his family. lol. To those of you who are concerned about by substance abuse issues, um... yeah, why would you not think I have issues with the sliver of my life I have represented here? I never knew I had that kind of ugly in me but, it came out and now I know what I'm capable of. And I never wish to see it again. lol. It's one awful awful night that I never want to re-live. Ever.

I run a locksmith shop alone, so as you can imagine I get comments of all kinds. (5'6 20 year old woman here.) 

Just now a woman came in and said ""I don't think you're strong enough, but can you put this key ring on this key for me?"" I took a look, it was no ordinary key ring. The ""key ring"" was a tiny, tear drop peice of metal made to be almost impossible to bend. You know when something appears to be made out of standard wire, and then you go to bend it and it is impossible? Like, it might as well be made out of hard plastic? That was what this was made of, and it didn't care what gender was opening it, it was not giving in.

Okay, she's a customer, I've got tools, I can do this. Nope, no tools could bend this fucker. It was made to withhold resistance, even if I were to pry it open, It would snap right back. The only way to do it was with my hands. She started to say ""yeah its okay I'll go somewh...."" when I played the words ""I don't think you're strong enough"" back in my head. 

Then I played them again. And again. And again. My thumb dug into the opening of the wire, my hand cramped, my nail chipped. The opening crept open one micrometre at a time, all the while being constantly held in place by each set of stinging thumbs and pointer fingers. ""I don't think you're strong enough, I don't think you're strong enough, I don't think you're.."" SNAP. 
The key slid in. 

Ladies, I am surprised to see how many women doubt me when they need keys copied or something fixed. It is almost never men, the most they do is blush and say ""You don't look like a locksmith.""  Fine, I know I don't, I'm wearing a god damn floral dress, but some women that come in have this tone. This almost disapproving, doubtful, confused tone in their voice when they ask me a question. They have even asked if there is a man ""that works here"" that can cut their keys for them. We are talking about a shop the size of a small kitchen. There isn't even a bathroom in here. 

Just thought I'd share my story for today, and vent a bit about how members of my own gender make me feel not suitable enough for the job I do everyday. Have a great day everyone, feel free to share any of your own stories! 

EDIT: Wow guys! Thank's so much for the responses and sharing all of your struggles/stories. I enjoyed reading all of them and I'm so sorry you all have to go through things ten times worse that me.

She needs our help with this filibuster -- she has to last until midnight tonight, speaking without a break as she remains standing (no leaning, even) while speaking on the bill at hand.

She has had 1 warning already for ""going off-topic,"" which means discussing matters ""unrelated"" to SB 5 (the warning was for discussing the state budget as it relates to women's healthcare and funding Planned Parenthood). She needs our help -- she needs our voices to fill the hours until midnight because this is not a one-woman-job.

Please submit your story, even if you are not a Texan. All you have to do is stay on-topic. Here is [the actual bill](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/831/billtext/html/SB00005E.htm), for reference.

The pro-choice women of Texas thank you for your time.


**UPDATE**: The bill is dead! I was there last night and it was an amazing experience. [Here is a great article that sums up the parliamentary shenanigans](http://www.austinchronicle.com/blogs/news/2013-06-26/a-victory-by-the-people/) that went on last night. 

Davis's filibuster was shut down at around 9:30 for a 3rd strike (going off-topic). The Texas Democrats then attempted every time-wasting trick in the book they could to prevent a final vote on the bill with only an hour and a half left in the special session. They ran out of options at 11:45, and long story short the crowd in the capitol rotunda just started screaming and clapping to drown out the legislators and further prevent the vote. We managed to create a deafening roar for over 20 minutes straight.

There's more to it, but at about 3 this morning it was announced that the vote on the bill had occurred at 12:02 am, after the session had ended, so it was invalid.

Unfortunately Rick Perry can still call another special session to try and pass similar legislation, so the fight isn't over.",,False,,t5_2r2jt,1372265489.0,,,True,t3_1h2l1b,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1h2l1b/please_help_texas_women_by_sending_in_your_story/,

This image was being shared on my facebook wall, and as a male, it made me want to scream at these people.

The post implies that a woman needs a man to support her and only the woman should have a good past.

Why can't a woman have a good future too?

Why shouldn't the man have a good past? Why is it necessary for a woman to be an angel while it's okay for the man to have any kind of past he desires.

These sort of 'gender roles' hurt not only women, but also men (although probably to a lesser extent).

The worst part is that there are females sharing this post too.

well last night i dressed really cute, put on a little make up, and decided that i was going to venture out of  my comfort zone, even if it just meant talking to someone new. i went to a party with a lot of people i knew but also a lot i didn't so i was feeling pretty good about the situation. if my plan failed, i could always hang out with my friends. i ended up noticing this really cute guy who was talking with some friends of mine. i walked over and we eventually got to talking; he just moved to the city and we had a long conversation about all the cool things to do in philly. i felt pretty good about myself, usually talking to someone so cute would be slightly intimidating to me but the conversation flowed easily and he was really nice.

later, we ended up going back to a mutual friends house with a few people to drink, smoke, and watch movies. after another beer and a hit of a blunt i worked up the courage to ask him to come smoke a cigarette with me. as we were smoking, i turned to him and said ""i hope this isn't too forward, but i think you're really cute."" he said, ""it's not... i think that you're really cute too."" so i smiled (still can't believe i did this!) and said ""is it too forward to admit that i want to kiss you?"" he stepped closer to me and said ""i want to kiss you too"". we kissed, and it was great. he was a really good kisser and i left shortly after with a smile on my face. 

the old me would have never had the balls to do that. i used to be so insecure and unsure of myself. in a way, i feel like i'm growing up. i'm not scared to say what i want and go for it both in life and in relationships. the old me would have wanted to kiss him, but just mentally talked myself out of it. i'm glad the new me was able to just go for it, because it turned out better than i could have ever imagined. 

he just texted me, asking if i could hang out today. maybe there really is something to the whole ""confidence"" thing. :)

TL;DR: a formerly shy girl decided to be more confident, went to a party, met a boy, and had an amazing night. confidence is power, as cheesy as that sounds.

EDIT: So, I realize it's not so effective or becoming to try and police what people should post/ upvote, so is there any interest in a 2XC spinoff subreddit with all the content but a limit on self-posts? Sorta like /r/women, but including some of the awesome ""lighter"" content from 2x (DIY, makeup, fashion) along with the feminist issues that are important to us. This way, people in need of affirmation/ support can come to TwoX while the new subreddit will be more content-based.

EDIT #2: I just registered /r/femmit. Thoughts?

**Final Edit:** Head over to /r/femmit if you'd like to input your ideas for the community.

We're thinking of aborting our unborn child due to severe health issues that we just found out about.,1467,566,459,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/q2jgm/was_advised_to_post_here_my_wife_and_i_are_facing/,"My wife and I have been together for over 10 years, married for 5 and have a 3 year old.  We're currently 22 weeks pregnant and found out last night that our unborn son has a major heart defect and possible genetic issues. 

The cardiologist tells us he has a hypo plastic left heart syndrome.  Also, the severity of this case is one of the worst he's seen.

They say that best case scenario is 3 major heart surgeries and a life expectancy of 50% chance of living to age 5 due to what were faced with.  He would require a pacemaker and eventually a heart transplant. 

My wife and I have always said that we would never abort, but now facing this struggle... And a hard road ahead (as per the doctors), we are now looking into terminating the pregnancy.  They say that they always want to advise the parents of the whole picture and specifically said that with OUR case.... It's one of the major reasons to end the pregnancy to the severe impact on quality of life.

It's honestly the worst thing for us that has ever happened. Doctors never gave a warning of anything wrong and now here we are in the second trimester. 

To give insight on how severe this is, they even mentioned infant hospice.    They say that he will not survive outside the womb unless we rush him into open heart surgery immediately. 

This is my personal story and I share because if it was illegal for my family to even think this, then I don't know how I could even deal with this..

People hate on abortions but for my family this was a child that we wanted.  We have a name picked out and the room is all done up.  Our  older son even talks to my wife's belly. 

I have always been pro-choice, but now I can see why sometimes this is ""needed"".  I have never been so sad in my life before..but I know that my wife and I will make it through this.  We keep saying that we're doing this, because we love him and do not want to see him suffer.

Edit: we had our amnio done and have set a date for an abortion.  Absolutely the hardest decision in our lives.

Five years ago, when I was 16, I was in a really bad relationship.  He was physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive.  When I finally ended it, things took a turn for the worst and police got involved.  I've had a lot of trouble dealing with the events that happened.  Unfortunately, severe depression and PTSD stemmed from this relationship/breakup. 

Today, my mind was wondering while I was working and somehow I started thinking about him.  When we were dating he made me memorize his phone number so I would be able to call him whenever, and wherever, even if I didn't have my phone.  I felt like that number was branded into my brain.  Today, for the first time in five years, I couldn't remember the number!  

This is such a small thing but it gives me great joy!  I still have trouble coping with everything that happened so small victories like this make that easier.

I spent 5 days in the hospital.  My husband not only took care of me (bringing me whatever I needed, sitting with me until I fell asleep, helping me shower), he took care of our four year old son wonderfully.  

After I came home from the hospital he still handled pretty much everything and encouraged me to rest, cooked for me etc.  I'm on vacation now (still exhausted from my illness) and he's been getting up with our son every morning to let me sleep, waking me up with back rubs and just in general spoiling me during my time off. 

He's a good man and boy do I love him!  Just wanted to share, the sweet guys never get enough credit.

Edit:  To the folks who are saying this is what marriage should be, you are exactly right.  But let's be honest, how often is it the GOOD spouse you hear about?  On television, in magazines and even Reddit it's usually the cheating spouse, the uncaring spouse, the abandoning spouse/partner you hear about.  And men a lot of time get the short end of this stick.  I love seeing posts about sweet partners so I just wanted to share my own.  I count myself lucky to have a real man.  It hasn't always been perfect, but I have never doubted that my husband would do whatever it took to take care of myself and our son.  And we would do the same for him.  I'm going to show him this thread when he wakes up (He had a late night of playing nerdy board games with his buddies so he's sleeping in.) because I want him to see that other people appreciated his loyalty and love.

My question is: why is waiting or not waiting always just about sex?


I like sex (a lot), but it's hardly the most important or intimate thing I do with my fiance.  I let him touch my weird feet.  I put extra cheese on his french onion soup.  I roll around and make weird noises when words can't express how happy I am to be sharing my life with him.  I found myself petting his head the other day, and he made the comment that people have sex for a lot of reasons, but if someone's petting your head, they probably love you a whole lot.


I have chosen (broadly) to not wait, and to not hold anything back from this relationship, because that's how I think we give each other the best shot at a future together.  If I was ""waiting,"" though, I don't think the one thing I held back would be sex.

**-""Monthiversaries""-** When a couple celebrates their ""monthly anniversary of their relationship beginning"" IE: ""ZOMG Today is Tyler and My 7 month anniversary! We've been together, like, forever!"" Whenever a girl friend tries to tell me one of these, I point her [here](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anniversary?s=t).

**-Freaking out over small things he says/does**- Most times, I just remind myself that I say things I don't mean ALL THE TIME. I also am not very good at saying exactly what I mean, and I think most people are like that. Keep that in mind before freaking out over his comments on your clothing. Just because he said he likes the other dress better doesn't mean that THIS DRESS MAKES ME LOOK LIKE A HEFFER.

**-""He still has feelings for his ex. Therefore, he can't possibly have feelings for me.""** Ok. I consider myself a pretty intelligent woman. The fact that I have literally thought this before just shows that I am not. Yes, it sucks when someone loves someone else more than you. But I've been in plenty of sticky situations where I myself have had feelings for many people at one time. Especially during high school! For some reason, my silly little mind said ""even though you're totally OK with the fact that you like 4083929247403 different people at once, IT IS NOT OK FOR HIM TO LIKE ANYONE ELSE BECAUSE SCIENCE!"" Especially if your relationship is new, it's OK to have feelings for other people. If it makes you uncomfortable, just talk to them about it.

**-""He's out of my league!"" or ""Oh no. He's way too attractive for me""**  NO! JUST NO! After YEARS of insecurity for not looking like a perfect, cookie-cutter, Hollister-wearing so-cal wannabe, I have realized something that could have saved me tons of trouble in my past: **confidence is key**. Once I got to a point in my life where I was truly happy with myself, (Yes, there are times that I dislike certain parts of myself, but for the most part, I'm really glad with who I am) there seemed to be no limits. ""Out of my league"" does not exist to me anymore. Rather, ""Not compatible with my personality and interests"" is more relevant. I think this boils down mostly to accepting and loving yourself, but also, STOP PUTTING LIMITS ON YOURSELF. Who cares if he's out of your league? Doesn't hurt to TRY?! If he says no or doesn't flirt back, then so be it. It's not the end of the world. But if he does bite after taking that chance, then HELLL YEEEEAAAAH- scored a hottie!

-**""I'm going to learn how to do XYZ because so-and-so will like me much more if I do!""** Guilty as charged. Even now. In fact, I became obsessed with Magic: The Gathering simply because I could never get a word in when my boyfriend and his friends were playing. Eh. Can't beat em, join em. But I think the primary difference here is that I learned about one of his interests because *I wanted to*, not because I thought it would make him like me more. Never again will I waste countless hours learning about Manchester United or watching ""The Green Lantern"" 5 times in one night because it is your man's favorite thing. No. Those things are nice, and if I do happen to become interested in those things through knowing you, then GREAT! But no more trying to force myself to like things for other people, especially men!!!! Yes, it may work out where he may find you wildly attractive because you know something about his favorite sports team. But in the end, you're doing yourself a huge disservice by not sharing YOUR interests with him, or finding an interest of his that you mutually like.

-**Petty JEALOUSY!!!**- Ok, this one's iffy because I think I will NEVER get over jealousy. Here's usually what happens: my guy does something with someone else or to someone else that gets me thinking ""hmm. I'm really jealous because I'd like him to pay that kind of attention to me instead,"" but then I start thinking I'm crazy for getting jealous over silly things like my boyfriend subtly flirting with the waitress who was flirting first. So then I'm in a dilemma with myself- AM I ALLOWED TO BE JEALOUS? Yes and No. Yes, it's natural to feel jealousy because we all want to be liked and loved and the center of attention and it hurts when that attention is directed elsewhere. But perspective is also a really beautiful thing. Him being flirty with the waitress is NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL! And if it really bothers you that much, casually say something (I don't mean nag him about why that slutty ho was getting more attention that you)! Also, it won't kill you to turn to him and say ""I get jealous when you talk to other girls like that because I really enjoy attention from you."" That (at least to me) doesn't sound like I'm psychotic, but also gets the point across.

-**""I'm FINE""**- Ok ladies, let's cut the crap. They're onto us! Men now know the secret translation. ""I'm fine"" really translates to ""No, I'm not fine."" So why do we do this? Well, lots of reasons. Most times, I said this because I didn't want to talk about it anymore or I didn't want the other person to see how hurt I was or I was just so damn mad that I couldn't muster out anything else to the other person. But men don't do well with code-speak (I don't blame them, I don't either). So, it's much more beneficial to just say ""I'm upset. We can talk about it later when I've calmed down."" This, to me, seems like the logical response, rather than ""I'm fine."" ""I'm fine"" is a blatant LIE most times. WHY LIE?!?! I don't get it and your man won't either, so just simply telling him the truth or telling him that you don't wish to talk about it will make things a lot easier. 

On the same lines...

**-Saying the opposite of what you really mean**- I don't know how or why this happens. Sometimes, things just slip out of my mouth that are the complete opposite of what I wanted to say. Sometimes, my natural reaction to my man is to make things as vague and confusing as possible. Does this bother anyone else? Because I really hate when I say something to my man and instantly think ""why did I just say that? That's not REALLY what I want/was thinking."" I think this mostly occurs because my hormones can somehow speak faster than my brain can. Taking two seconds to think about what you're going to say before you say it works wonders (not only for this, but for fixing a LOT of problems in the world.....). Also, never again will I utter the phrase *""I'm fat*"" just to hear someone deny. This is just mind torture. Why not just say, ""Hey. I'm feeling a little self-conscious today and would like some affirmation of my physical attractiveness."" (PS- I've said that exact phrase before and not only was my man shocked that I was logically saying EXACTLY what I felt and WANTED, but I got some very nice sexytime out of it :) )

**-Getting mad about really small, insignificant things. Not explaining, just blowing up.**- This used to happen to me a lot. ""So-and-so didn't text me when he said he was going to so now I'm really upset/mad and BLARGH!"" It's perfectly OK to get mad at whatever you want to- it's your life. But write about it in your journal, whine to your girlfriends about it, and GET OVER IT. No need to hold resentment for months because he left the toilet seat up. Again. Things work out much better when you calmly explain ""It really bothers me when you do this or that you did this because XYZ"" I always find that with ANYTHING, you should have REASONS. It bothers me so much when my girl friends complain to me about various things their boyfriends do to upset them, but when I ask them WHY it bothers them, they have no idea

And finally, one that I will probably never get over. One that really isn't that silly, but that seems silly to me. 

**-The Brain-versation**- That akward back-and-forth debate between you and yourself over, well, anything and everything. Case in point:
Me: ""I think I'll invite so-and-so over to my parents' house for dinner""
Brain: ""Yeah, but then he might think you're crazy because you've only been seeing each other for six months and then he'll feel like you're forcing meeting the parents on him and that you'll want to meet his parents, and he'll probably assume you're prepping for the wedding already.""
Me: ""Brain, you're crazy. It's just a picnic""
Brain: ""Oh, so now I'm CRAZY?!""
*sigh* Sometimes, I could drive myself nuts. Somehow, I always end up second guessing my decisions or what I'm going to say/have said, and fantasize it into this HORRIBLE thing. It's really not. Most guys won't automatically jump to ""CREEPER"" if you invite them over for dinner. (Some might, but hey). In fact, I don't know of any college kid that would deny some good home cooking once in awhile. Too often than not, I have refrained from telling someone the truth about how I truly feel because my brain was painting scenarios of what that person would think/do/say. STOP THIS! Condition your brain to think of what YOU would do/how YOU would feel after saying this. Yeah, you should be mindful of other people's feelings, etc. but so help me God I will never refrain from saying ""Stop. Too Deep"" because I'm afraid it might kill the mood. Sometimes, you have to be a little selfish. And by selfish, I mean, make your brain stop going off into ridiculous ""What if"" land.

Whew. So, that turned into a novel. And most of them weren't THAT silly I guess.

I can't tell why exactly but it makes me feel uncomfortable to see parents or just the internet in general over-reacting over little girls liking science or animals , raving about how EDGY and MODERN and how she's so much more intelligent than girls who like purple or gentle stuff.

Isn't it a bit conter-productive to make little girls who like traditional ''girl'' stuff inferior for actually liking it? Isn't it a bit trophy-for-breathing-today like to cheer on a little girl who likes insect?

why are we feeling like prefering blue over pink something SO gender-roles defying and SO intelligent when I'm pretty sure the kid itself doesn't give a fuck and doesn't see anything daring in picking a t-shirt.

Aren't we RE_ENFORCING gender roles and stereotype when we freaking point the line and notice EVERYTIME a kid ''crosses'' it. Doesn't telling a little girl she's cool for liking boy stuff still passes on the concept of boy thing ~girl thing ?

I thought she did a fine job with what they wrote for her). She’s so goddamn smart, and we know that she ends up inventing the goddamn Genesis device, so it’s a huge waste to make her little more than eye candy for Kirk. Putting her in her underwear was embarrassing to me as a member of the Star Trek Family, and served absolutely no purpose other than to make teenage boys feel weird, like when they climb the rope in gym class.

Let me walk ya through it. I get up, take a shower, and head to campus for my first class. As I'm walking in the building I feel it. That horribly odd feeling in your underwear that makes your stomach drop. My period?!?! How did I forget about that little demon?!?! I immediately run into the bathroom to survey the damage. White underwear? Close to ruined. But then, SWEET JESUS it didn't hit my pants! With a sigh of relief I search my backpack for a tampon. Frantically unzipping every fucking pocket (does my backpack have a secret passage way?) I don't find a single tampon. My initial response was to yell 'NOOOOO!!!!' but instead I went into full fledged panic mode.

I stuffed some toilet paper in my underwear (a 5 minute fix) and went through the building trying to find any female possible. To any girl I happened upon I approached them with a ""hey, this is embaressing, but would you happen to have a tampon?"" The reaction from most was absurd. Women were looking at me like I'm some crazed animal asking for their first born. We're on a college campus. We're adults. Having a period is nothing to be ashamed of. But women were looking back at me with disgusted looks on their face and either simply shaking their head or ignoring me entirely. I find it hard to believe that out of 10+ women I asked not one had a tampon. What happened to helping a sista out? I've given multiple tampons to complete strangers. Finally I sprinted across campus to a gas station and bought a box from some creepy 400 pound man. Oh, and I was 20 minutes late to class. 

So ladies, the point of my tirade is this: be kind to your fellow sisters and help a girl out. You see a girl crying on a bench? Ask her if she's ok. You see a girl with her skirt tucked into her underwear? Tell her. If a chick needs a tampon? Give that bitch a tampon. Small acts of kindness like this can make a huge difference in someone's day.

Edit: Holy moley ladies (and gentlemen)!!! Didn't think a short story about my morning would get so much feedback :) Thanks to all that said they'd give me a tampon, to someone you're going to be a life savor!!! Now I did want to address something that a few have mentioned. I did state that there was a creepy man at the gas station. No he's not creepy because he works at a gas station, or that he was over weight. Yes, I could have explained that situation better. He was creepy because I was trying to discreetly buy tampons and get kept GAWKING at my chest. Yes, that's creepy.

Quoted from pg. 15-16 of Up Till Now:

“While still in high school I got my first real job in the theater - as a stage manager. I was fifteen years old and had absolutely no experience. Looking back, I suspect I got the job because I was young and good-looking and oh so terribly naive. A well-known French male singer was starring in a play at the Orpheum Theatre […] The actor was tall and good-looking and […] he asked me if I wanted to join him for dinner.

 Well, I thought, I must be a great stage manager. The star of the show has asked me to have dinner with him. Naturally, I accepted his invitation. As we left the theater that night, he asked me if I had a jacket with me. “No, ” I admitted.

 “That’s fine"", he said casually. “I’ve got a jacket that’ll fit you in my hotel room “.

 Welcome to show business, Shatner. The strongest memory I have of that night is being chased around the bed. Football season had recently ended so I was in good shape and strong. Incredibly, I didn’t even know what he wanted. I was unaware of homosexuality. I didn’t know that men could be attracted to other men. It was not something spoken about in middle-class Jewish homes.

After miscarrying triplets several months back, we were so happy to find out we were expecting again. This time we kept it quiet, and didn't even get a midwife right away (kept on my prenatals though!). When I felt like we must be nearing the 2nd trimester mark, I made an appointment with a midwife, to find they were backed up for two months D: We took the closest one they had, March 19th. That day we would be finding out all about our baby. For insurance purposes we went in and got the blood test from our PCP, blood levels suggesting that we were 15-22 weeks along. Super surprise there, 5 1/2 months, no way! Well our friends stocked us up on all the baby things, the date gets nearer and nearer, and one night the cramping starts.

In the morning we have some delicious sex, and dismiss the stabbing pains that occur, enjoying our love to the fullest. Afterwards we separate, and go to clean up- he's covered in blood, oh shit! Decide bleeding just happens sometimes, surely I couldn't be miscarrying at 5 1/2 months! So I go to work, and he's off to school. We decide if there's still bleeding after I get out of work, I will go to the e-room and get checked out.

After a beautifully sunny day, and a horribly cramp-filled and bloody bicycle ride home we ship me off to the e-room. My daughter and sweetheart stay at home, watching Inuyasha, keeping things as chill as possible in the home-front. I knew it though, that something was wrong, I just knew in my gut and I prepared myself for another miscarry. I hoped this time it wouldn't end with me nearly loosing my life, saved by a D&amp;C, and emergency blood transfusion... but at 5 1/2 months along? This was going to be messy and painful, keep me here doc, I don't want my daughter to see this horrible mess.

After blood tests show that I should be ready to pop, as high as blood levels are, they decided to send me for an ultrasound. I kept seeing what I thought must be the top of my babies head, but there was no heartbeat, and no baby, just a lump of some hemorrhaging tissue and fluid. It was shortly after decided I was experiencing a Molar Pregnancy. I'd never heard of this before, but they tell me I need an emergency D&amp;C, they don't even want to wait a whole day, but they need to find a doctor, and they need my stomach to be clear, I'm scheduled for the very next morning- this morning.

Everything came out ok, my daughter seems to be taking things well, she always does, but I hear her crying at night. I go to snuggle and she pretends like she's been sleeping. Only 7 and already trying to act so damn grown-up. My sweetheart is unreadable, stony faced, hard to hug. I don't know if it's from the loss, or the fact that this thing might be cancer and he doesn't know how to deal. I have friends over to help with dinner, let us snuggle their babies, distract from the pain. All is well, but I can't get it out of my head...

The next year my hormone levels will be monitored once a week. If it doesn't 0 out in six months, I will need to start chemotherapy, and they will be checking my lungs, and other organs for signs of this cancerous shit. I am 27, wtf. This entire last year has been so up and down. I'm glad for my friends and my poly lifestyle, I wouldn't have survived through this with out all the support. I got the guts to leave an abusive man, divorced, lost the house, and car, all my clothes and belongings, my daughter's things- but gained freedom. We were homeless, then rented a yurt, got a job, started eating healthy and having good exercise habits. Got sick, horribly sick, found out I was pregnant, got even sicker, lost my job, miscarried, got sicker, still found another job, got sicker, had a thyroglossal duct cyst infection, had surgery to get it removed, decide things are serious with one of my partners of a year (the miscarried triplets father), move into a wonderful place, stay sick, loose job, live on savings, daughter switches schools, is happy for the first time in years with a man who doesn't hurt me, and a school where kids don't make fun of her, and her teacher helps her, we plan our garden, i'm finally recovering, find out we're pregnant, so so happy, get a job, dream job for real, everything we need for baby, loving support from partners and friends, sweetie is rocking the college, switches majors to programming and happy dances and love making and smile filled walks and family dinners home made nommy nomms, daughter is asking to help with all the chores, give her more freedoms, so many hugs, so much love in this house, so much support for each other learning and growing, first day of work was supposed to be yesterday, spent in e room, work is understanding, taking time off for another surgery, they still want me back I'm dynamic, still all the love and support, just a veil of sadness hovering over all the things.

Don't care if made sense, my turn to rant. TL;DR? oh well, at least I feel better after venting to a bunch of faceless strangers, lol. Thanks for sticking with me if you did.

EDIT: UPDATE 12:20pm (March 6th)

Started bleeding and cramping heavily again just now, alright I thought, maybe a little more stuff just checking out in a clump... then checked my temperature, as I was instructed to do over the next 48 hours, and it's at 101.1. I called immediately as I was instructed to do if my temp went up. I'm currently waiting for a ride to the emergency room. Apparently this isn't good, really... really? I can't just go home and sleep it off? I think I would be freaking out a lot more, if all you wonderful people hadn't been here for me all morning. I'm taking you guys with me to the e-room I'll have you know. I guess we'll see what happens guys :(

EDIT: UPDATE 4:48pm

Well, it looks like we're all good, there's no infection, just pain for no good reason! They gave me something to relax me after having been up all night with cramping and sharp pains in the ol' vag and uterus. So, whew. Looks like I'll be able to go home and relaxe :) hopefully I'll get some good sleep tonight. THANKS AGAIN GUYS &lt;3 All the hugs are so appreciated!

EDIT: UPDATE 8:32 pm

Just got home from the ER. They've upped my pain meds, thankfully, and suctioned some more stuff out of me to stop the bleeding. Everything is going smooth again. Blood tests show my HCG levels are down, even since yesterday. I was dehydrated, and really low on potassium (that's crazy because I eat my vitamins, and eat mostly fresh fruits, and fresh cooked veggies and stuff everyday!) I was instructed to be on bedrest for the next two days, to take it light on day three, and to start getting up and around on day four- day five I can return to work! I can't wait to call my boss tomorrow, and tell him his star trainee is coming back soon! I was instructed to get in for more blood tests first thing next week, OH, and ACTUALLY rest on this bedrest thing- not stay at home and clean the house, do laundry, cook, etc. Awwww schucks, you mean I gotta sit around and do nothing?? I had no problem with that when I had diapers to be sewing, and booties to be knitting :p I guess here comes the long wait. . . What will the blood tests look like next week? Will the levels keep dropping? How do I keep from stressing out like crazy, over something I have no control over? I know, just let it go... but sometimes that's harder than it seems. Especially when something like chemo sounds so painful. Guess I will have to start quilting or something, keep my hands busy, and my mind out of my brain.

Edit: April 19th, 9:13am

Looks like things are going well, the cancer IS going away, I won't need Chemo, and my sweetie and are going to be waiting until we're in a better place me physically and both of us financially, before trying again. Thank you all for being here with me when I felt so desperate and lonely, when I felt like nothing in the world would ever be ok again &lt;3 A million hugs &lt;3",,False,,t5_2r2jt,1366388140.0,,,True,t3_19rpku,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/19rpku/looks_like_my_babybump_was_just_a_lump_instead_of/,

If you don't feel like reading these links the long and short of it is that I was passed over for a job specifically because my interviewer thought I needed more make up. I called the owner and he's still doing everything he can to fix the situation so it's fair for everyone involved. He is also a very awesome dude. I was promised a verbal and a written apology when my interviewer was ready to give a sincere one.

I got the call on Monday, but life got in the way of OP delivering. I'm still waiting on the written, but I was told it's in the mail.
Without further ado, her apology:

""Hello Miss InKitchen, before I actually apologize I wanted you to know that I had to call and apologize to every applicant I turned away. Then I had to invite them back for a second interview. I also have to have a second person sit in for the whole process. In short: your phone call has made my life much harder for the time being.""

""If you're looking for an apology for all the extra hassle I'm afraid you've called the wrong number.""

""No, no. Nothing like that. I'm saying all this because after hearing your recorded phone call, after calling a list of past applicants as long as my forearm, after sitting through hours of retraining I realized that I was the one with the narrow mind and the one with the problem. I was judging people based on superficial ideals, both at and outside of work. I was being rude, unprofessional, and shallow. After going through all this hassle and dreading having to call you, the person who set it all in motion, I realized you helped me start to become a better employee and hopefully a better person. Now I don't have to apologize to you, I want to. I want you to know that I am sorry and I will change. I also wanted to thank you for helping to bring about that change. If it weren't for how you handled the situation I could have been fired or caused a lawsuit for my company. Thank you for that as well.""

I thanked her for the apology and congratulated her on her self realizations and continued employment. Then we hung up. I really hope everything she said was true, but it did sound like she was reading from a bulleted list of buzz-words. I actually feel like this phone call took away some of the closure I felt after my conversation with the owner. I'm just left feeling like a checked box on her to-do list, nothing more. At least she has the words right, maybe the actions will follow.

I am the teen librarian in the community and it is a day about honesty.  Talk about your problems with life, suicide, drugs, alcohol etc.  Really anything and everything you could want.  I was so surprised and honestly cried a little for these girls.  One girl was knocked out at a party and raped by three men, she later tried to over dose on pills.  Another girls sister almost died in her arms because of a drug over dose.  One girl has a brother who went to jail that day for trying to kill his girlfriend...and another has an eight year old sister who was raped by her older step brother.  Really deep and disturbing stuff.  The area that I live in/the school is in is predominately white, poverty level is extremely low, most people have an education of a Bachelor's Degree or higher and the there are generally wealthy people living here.  My particular group had 12 students.  I was so shocked.  I graduated from high school in 2006...the students told me now that things like heroine in the bathroom isn't unheard of.  

I was there to listen, ask questions and help fuel conversation...I just want to tell all of you that if you need to talk, I can listen.  Seek help if you need to and don't be afraid to open up.  All 12 students cried at one point.  It was so moving and powerful honestly.  I encourage teachers (if any read this) to try a program like this.  It helped a lot with team building etc.  One girl that came was constantly made fun of by another girl and by the end of the day they were hugging and crying together.  Will that friendship last?  I don't know but it was very moving and really taught me that you don't know what battles people are fighting.  Just wanted to share!
