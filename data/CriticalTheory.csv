I'm trying to learn, but I'm having trouble with some of the more technical terms, like 'reification', which all sources seem to assume you're familiar with. I bought the Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy and the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and those help with many things -- but not with this. If someone could just help me understand this concept a little better, I'd love it. For some reason, it's just not getting through to me. 

So, reification means mistaking, with or without being aware of it, something intangible for something concrete and really existing. Examples of intangible things are relationships between people/social structures, or sort of 'thought experiment' things we create in our minds to explain concepts (mental constructs, I think is the term?). 

For example, ""mother nature"" -- nature is really just an endless series of interactions between cells, organisms, laws of physics, etc, with no desires, goals, or motivations, but sometimes we talk as if it is. Or more specifically, ""evolution"", as in 'evolution wants this', 'natural selection wants that', etc. Or gold/money, which in itself isn't actually valuable and doesn't have some innate ability to motivate people -- that only exists because we've decided as a society to basically invest gold with the idea of 'this represents work.' 

Have I understood that concept properly? 

My confusion then comes from trying to envision other specific examples of this in the real world, especially examples relevant to things like Marx, Debord, Vaneigem, etc. In what ways does reification occur that Debord would be interested in? In what ways does it occur that Marx would be interested in, and why is it such a big deal in these fields? Without real-world examples, it's hard to understand their writing. For example...

&gt; The commodity can be understood in its undistorted essence only when it becomes the universal category of society as a whole. Only in this context does the reification produced by commodity relations assume decisive importance both for the objective evolution of society and for the attitudes that people adopt toward it, as it subjugates their consciousness to the forms in which this reification finds expression. . . . As labor is increasingly rationalized and mechanized, this subjugation is reinforced by the fact that people’s activity becomes less and less active and more and more contemplative.

-- Gyorgy Lukacs (used as the epigraph to the second part of Society of the Spectacle, which is wonderful to the extent that I can make sense of it and maddening for the other 95% of my time with it)

What reification does commodity relations assume, exactly? I mean, I'm looking at my understanding of reification up there, and just can't imagine what he might mean. I have a feeling that it's the same thing as commodity fetishism, which is another thing I can't really wrap my brain around... what's being reified in the case of commodity fetishism?

I know very little about critical theory. But I frequently find those interested in the subject to be hostile to analytic philosophy - something I myself am interested in. Do you find this to be a common sentiment? And, if so, what sorts of criticisms are usually made? I think that a discussion about this might be fun. (Emphasis on the ""fun""! I'm really just looking for an entertaining debate to distract from my work - let's keep it civil.)

Also: let's just assume for the sake of argument that we have a rough and ready understanding of what 'analytic philosophy' denotes. It's admittedly an imprecise label, but surely we've got a reasonable grip on the general style of philosophy it picks out.

Everyone knows that our economy and government are corrupt, but I don't see this viewpoint represented anywhere, except very superficially. Compared to critical theorists, most people only have vague knowledge of oppression, so when I talk to people about oppression all the connections I drop between superficially distinct forms of oppression ends up blowing minds.

I've read a number of essays and chapters of his, but currently I'm digging into his late lectures, [The Neutral](http://www.scribd.com/doc/36196704/Roland-Barthes-The-Neutral), and in it he uses Doxa a lot.

I think it's an extremely important phenomenon. If depression is feeling helpless and devoid of free will, that's so critical in a society that revolves around achievement. On my own I'm starting to imagine depression as the inevitable psychological collapse of ridiculous narratives around choice, achievement and being self made. Not everyone can be a winner, not everyone can be a rising entrepreneur that rises past everyone else, not everyone can be better than everyone else. And the culture of achievement in capitalism, particularly American capitalism, is very vicious and failure to achieve makes you look like a toothless, helpless person who should be ashamed. I think that depressed people are the ones who start to see that this cult of achievement doesn't work in reality. And then, you know, enter Foucault and how they get labeled as psychological deviants and so on.

Anyone got anything? I've also been listening to these guys.

(Excerpt re: Marx and Lacan)",14,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/18ndoj/deleuze_and_the_meanings_of_immanence_by/,"&gt;And something odd appears to happen: the
term ‘immanence’ that Deleuze takes as the “secret” of philosophy in his 1968 thesis
on Spinoza now re-appears as realised within the movement of “capital-money” in
advanced systems of capitalism. Immanence disappears as philosophy in order to
return as the form proper to the most advanced capitalist social formations. Deleuze
and Guattari relate this use of the term ‘immanence’ to Marx. 

&gt;In the third volume of
Capital, Marx discusses the “immanent barriers” to the development of capitalism.
“Capitalist production constantly strives to overcome these immanent barriers, but it
overcomes them only by means that set up the barriers afresh and on a more powerful
scale. The true barrier to capitalist production is capital itself” (Marx, Capital, vol. III,
Penguin edition, 358). The immanence of capitalism thus refers prima facie to the
internality of its contradictions as a system, or more precisely the fact that its
generation of contradictions is essential to its continuation. Deleuze and Guattari are
particularly interested in Marx’s attempt to isolate the internal contradictions of the
capitalist system in Volume III, both in the analysis of the tendency of the rate of
5
profit to fall (Part Three), and in the theory of credit (Part Five). 

&gt;The tendency of the
rate of profit to fall is the motivation for “set[ting] up the barriers afresh and on a
more powerful scale”: through the shifting of the location of centres of production to
the developing world. But it is the system of credit in capitalism that is Deleuze and
Guattari’s particular focus in the sections on capitalism in Anti-Oedipus. The
immanence that emerges within capitalism is founded on a system of credit and debt
at the heart of the capitalist system. Advanced capitalist social formations unfold on
“an immense deterritorialized flow” constituting “the full body of capital”, “an
instantaneous creative flow that the banks create simultaneously as a debt owing to
themselves, a creation ex nihilo” (AO 237).

&gt; If capitalism “has realised immanence” it
is because its monetary system “has rendered concrete the abstract as such and has
naturalised the artificial, replacing territorial codes and despotic overcoding with an
axiomatic of decoded flows, and a regulation of these flows” (AO 261). Clearly, a
violent redefinition of the applicability of the notion of immanence has taken place
between 1968-72, and it appears to have occurred precisely through working through
the innovations occurring in Lacano-Althusserianism, in such a way that immanence
first of all makes its reappearance as the form of the tendentially all-encompassing
capitalist system that Deleuze and Guattari suggest cannot be explained using
Lacanian logic.

This isn't a bad thing itself, but they always want to argue with me and berate a strawmanned version of my own beliefs, and frankly, I've given up on convincing them. If I try to tell them it's not worthwhile, they accuse me of mysticism. My suggestion that, maybe, just maybe, they ought not dismiss an entire tradition without reading a single work within it has fallen on deaf ears. 

I know, ""get better friends."" The thing is that it's not just them. It's *everywhere.* Social media, good ole' fashion media, daily interactions--this kind of ideological bullshit is everywhere! And there's no use trying to reason with people since we simply seem to talk past one another!

1360538492.0,13,self.CriticalTheory,189tyq,A proposition regarding the attitude of 'trolling' on /r/criticaltheory,20,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/189tyq/a_proposition_regarding_the_attitude_of_trolling/,"I've been busy with my own work lately and have missed much of the discussion and moderation that has been going on regarding the activity of /u/georges_perec, and /u/jorge_luis_borges. 

This post is an amalgamation of two posts I just made, but are buried in other threads.

I don't believe such a thing as the 'institution of /r/criticaltheory' exists and I don't think it matters wetaher or not trolls are 'embraced'.

The mods of /r/criticaltheory (myself included) were invited to become mods because they appeared (to other mods) to have an interest in the discourse of this particular subreddit and were actively engaged in production of content. We are not elected, nor are we any more an 'authority' here than anyone else, we are simply active and interested in the discursive life of /r/criticaltheory and so we donate our time and attention to help see to its smooth operation. It's the community itself that has the power which they divvy up based on the way they vote, comment and post.

'Trolls' exist, online and in the world, weather or not they are embraced. Not only that, a 'troll' does not equal 'a person'. A more useful way to understand the troll's actions may be through a discussion of the attitude of 'trolling' that can and *is* embodied and articulated by any anon online, all the time. For all anyone knows, the person who created the troll account could be Barrak Obama himself-as ridiculous and unlikely as this claim may be-it is a key assumption that anon's share (whether or not they articulate or accept it).

If I had been active and engaged while the recent drama was unfolding, I would have not banned or removed any of the inflamatory comments. Despite a troll's tone, language or opinion, I have to agree that the point made by georges_perec in a buried comment stands: there really is nothing any anon (mod or otherwise) can *really* do to silence or prosecute another anon who is determined to 'troll' a particular space.

Attempting to ban or remove comments that offend even the majority's personal sensibilities is futile, and it's my position that rather than attempt to militantly instantiate some useless authority and spurr on the determined troll, (adding fuel to the fire, so to speak) I'd prefer to do one of two things:

1. Engage the troll in active dialogue and critique them in an attempt to better understand or neutralize their inflammatory remarks in an effort to find a common understanding regarding the ostensibly offensive idea; mutual respect for each other as anonymous users, (*not* respect for one toxic view or another) could go a long way in a subreddit dedicated to critical inquiry, and, in my opinion in the world at large as well.

2. Barring the effectiveness of option 1, or if any anon that feels triggered by a troll or has no interest in communicating with them regardless, do not vote (either up or down) on any of the comments or posts in question. Let reddit's front page protocols and the passage of time sort it all out. In my experience, nothing is more effective at shutting down a troll then a lack of feedback and attention.

**EDIT:** For visibility regarding context and rationale for the above proposition:

I certainly don't support or condone the cancerous posts and comments of trolls on this, or any subreddit. I think they are hurtful, inflammatory, senseless and toxic. Whatever your subjectivity be (gender, sex, race, creed...) this type of content added only causes harm.

I do however disagree with the primary premise regarding the function of a subreddit moderator. Subreddits abound on reddit with little to no local moderation. They are the majority of active subs, small and large in numbers of subscribers, and generally not riddled with trolls. This situation is the norm on reddit, because of the backend protocols of reddit's source code that make reddit tick, a backbone through which we all relay posts, comments and votes, synaptically. It is this hardcoded mechanism that moderates the visibility of content on the site. 

Reddit's sourcecode is designed to take in a lot of information. A lot. All of the time, good, bad, whatever. This data may be input by any person with access to an internet connection, and it is reddit's operational framework that enables us–the users–to sift through it in such a way that we are able to organize the segmentized content as it appears. Asymmetrical accumulations of data patterns (user, vote and post frequency, duration and lifespan; not to mention karma) then enact a sort of majority governed instinct that generates and translates trending anonymous user's activity and attention into an executive volition which determines what content gets the most visibility and what disappears from the front page. 

Attention is all that matters. Attentionattentionattention! I just made you read that because I already have your attention. ""Attention points"" is another way of saying ""karma"". Users engaged in communication here are all moderated by themselves by default in the reddit operational mode. 

So then, if overdetermining the position, power and ability of a subreddit moderator users can be led to espouse an attitude and generates content that insists on being equally if not *more* inflammatory, persecutory, vitriolic, punitive and– most importantly–**useless** as those of the tolls they resist (and I'm not singling you out here, because your attitude is diffuse). The last thing most users want is a flamewar and those users who are trolling, I think, are just trying really really *way-to-fucking* (sorry for the language but *obscenely* hard) to make their pain not only heard, but felt by the rest of us, all of us, or even just one other user. They are experiencing attention withdrawal and trolling is a habitual strategy to extort attention from others.

I can feel it, it's a pain of a particular style. Your position, one which is widely taken without a doubt by many reasonable, sincere and meaningful users, is the result of what seems to be the very same style of intense and sincere subjective pain and a resolute determination to eliminate it from existence. 

So how to break this cycle? Well if a user is exceptionally sensitive to one particular trolling attitude or another and prone to being triggered by extreme content, at first glance, that user should take option two, every time. This way, if enough do, there will be less traumatization to users already hurt and wounded, by toxic content posted with an intent to hurt, and it will open up a space (in allowing such posts to achieve visibility and keeping the comments in a trolling posts thread free from non-critical inquiries) for other users in /r/criticaltheory who feel safe and/or interested enough to, to actually critically engage with trolling users. 

Such interested critical users might see a trolling attitude on reddit as an opportunity to attempt to neutralize users with discursive trolling positions through critical inquiry intent on incisively exposing any/all assumptions, blindnesses, or gaps they may have in their perspective. If you are so interested, you might consider this very thread as a sort of useful scalpel for aiding the operation. 

In initial encounters with seasoned trolling users, you may not actually affect the trolling users position, let alone their minds. But of the countless others of interested users that happen to read your particular talking-with-a-troll thread, the greater the chances of one 'getting it,' learning something new about themselves, and others becomes. The accumulation of these users becoming more self-aware and meta-critical, makes that power of that initial, painful conversation intensify and eventually, hopefully, new, real changes in the position and mind of trolling users or users with ambivalence towards trolling, may successfully occur.

If the particular trolling position is not substantive, option 1 it is.

I certainly don't support or condone the cancer that exists all over reddit, but that doesn't stop it from existing. In fact I can't will anything *out* of existence. But I do sometimes feel pain and I know it sucks, and sometimes I feel pain in others, dark, obscure, garbled and menacing, but when I feel this in others visualized it in language, I find laguage used to generate critical comments and posts specifically designed to be used for critical inquiry, can function like this sort of sub-atomic virtual scalpel. One instrument for your critical toolkit. That scalpel can be used to help any user take the cancer out of any other trolling user and potential/virgin trolling users to excise cancerous elements within themselves. 

In the initial encounter with a seasoned trolling user, you may not actually affect the trolling users position, let alone their minds. But of the countless other users who happen to read your particular effort and attention in a particular talking-with-a-troll thread, the chances increase exponentially, the more users adopt a similar position. Eventually, that effort, made by those initial users, left in the form of painful critical exchanges between trolling users and the rest of us, may prove to change the mind of some future user whose ambivalence towards trolling might have otherwise become aggravated by their perceived state of critical isolation, and instead successfully dissuade themselves altogether out of a harmful attitude. 

It's this accumulation of dialogue from countless users' life experiences, some of which contains knowledge that I can completely relate to, that grabs my attention and makes me interested to knowing more, to learn more about myself through others. Hopefully, through continual sharing of interesting, useful content being generated by active, genuine users in cybertextual discursive communities in the form of posts, votes, and comments on reddit that more and more users with eventually find and start to use the discursive critical instruments that are strewn all around. It is my hope that my contributions to the creation of such tools (if conceptual instruments as such can even be said to 'exist') will one day affect good in another in the same way I have been beneficially so.",,False,self,t5_2tmcb,1360784521.0,,,True,t3_189tyq,http://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/189tyq/a_proposition_regarding_the_attitude_of_trolling/,moderator

**edit** expanded from comment:

These thoughts are my own and I'm open to any kind of reception or response.

Structural analysis is concerned describing the form and functionality of the various elements present in a given coherent project (a book, a film, a painting or an idea like 'God') in relation to their historical receptions and responses, by the largest audiences to date. For example, a structural analysis of *Django Unchained* might be interested in how various plot points work, what happens to who, why? When do characters do what they do? Why and who do they do them with? 

Specific questions may ask to any one element, and also consider that aspect as a moment in the evolution in relation to the greater body of work attributed to Tarantino over time. Questions like: Why is it that in *Inglorious Basterds* Germans were represented as villains, and then a few years later in Django Unchained, Tarantino makes a German character his tragic hero? Is there anything interesting happening in this relation? How does the selection of music, score, sound track, sound and effects impact the reception of Tarantino films? Is there anything significant about the fact that as writer/director, Tarantino tends to awkwardly appear in his own films?

Content analysis is interested in presenting a persuasive interpretation of a particular, coherent project (book, film, song or idea- like 'democracy'), and substantiating a descriptive analysis with actual evidence from the project itself. For example, a content analysis might consider a topic like, ""The Art and Ethics of Trolling,"" and use /r/criticaltheory as it's text of analysis. 
 
**tldr:** structural analysis is generally interested first in asking 'how' and 'why'. Content analysis is primarily concerned with asking 'what' and 'when' as then seeing 'how' and 'why' and where fit in later.

Also, any critical theoretical pieces on the nature of time in general would certainly be relative to my interests as well. I have a project I'm working on that may be taking Bakhtin's ideas a bit loosely, but I'm sure this is not untreaded ground by any means.

The context is Greece under conditions of austerity which really lent itself as a case study due to the fact that it is at the cross-roads of the European political crisis, as well as more broadly the global crisis of capitalism. Greece as Costas Douzinas points out in his latest book, appears to be in the process of becoming the frontier for Europe's future. 

My interest in particular is the phenomenon of resistance spreading throughout Europe in tandem with/in response to austerity. My hypothesis is that the most realistic prospect for change is that it must happen through the state, as opposed to going around it as many anarchists (I would include Hardt and Negri here) might claim. 

My question to you guys is relating to the concept of state. I've read around teh history of political-economy quite a bit, and am familiar with people like David Harvey etc. however supervisor suggested I go and get acquainted with how various theorists conceptualize the state within the capitalist mode of production, so that I can have a clear idea of the loci of power that I'm trying to deal with here. So I guess, what are the relevant institutions, processes and structures that I should keep in mind in theorizing the crisis of the neoliberal state, and resistance to it. 

I've read around the Poulantzas-Miliband debate, whose point of departure as I understand has been to build on Marx, who never got around to providing a coherent, systematic theory of the political superstructure under capitalism. Marxists often seem to take the famous passage from the Manifesto (“The modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie”) and treat the state as a monolithic, passive vehicle that is simply the instrument for bourgeois class interest. 

It seems to me that a critical concept of state should be more nuanced than that and take into account the fragmented nature of the state, which therefore also suggests the potential avenues for resistance (Miliband does this quite well imo).

Are there any texts that I might go to which deal with this problem? I've read close to nothing of Deleuze, apart from the Nomadology/War Machine chapter of the Thousand Plateaus quite a while ago. I'm currently having another look at Deleuze's Postscript on the Societies of Control which appears to be quite useful.

&gt; After Aristotle and Ptolemy, the idea that the Earth moves -- that strange, ancient, and 'entirely ridiculous idea, Pythagorean view-- **was thrown on the rubbish heap of history, only to be revived by Copernicus and to be forged by him into a weapon for the defeat of its defeaters.** (Feyerabend, *Against Method*, Chapter Four. Emphasis my own)

This screams of the creative portion of man both Walter Benjamin and  Ernst Bloch write of. Bloch tells us in *Heritage of Our Times* the truly creative back into history when creating a montage. His emphasis is not on the ""good old ideas"", the ones that are clearly in the lead now, but to the ones that were left for dead. To make them into ""bad new ones"". Benjamin shows us when he is unpacking his book collection that it may be ordered in any fashion he wishes. At this moment he is his most creative as he may make the apparently insignificant significant and vice versa. 

Just a thought that flew into my head as I read this and was wondering if anyone had some thoughts on it.

In my master’s thesis I developed a critical perspective on Facebook, drawing on Heidegger and Peter Sloterdijk, and one of the subject that I found the most intriguing and that I wished I could have developed more extensively is this idea that “when (on the net) every information becomes available and everything is related to everything else, the abolition of distances causes things to lose their significance”. In other words, when a link concerning a political revolution rests next to Lolcats, it’s “mattering” is hurt. I'd like to have your thoughts on that. This kind of ""argument"" (fear?) often comes more from conservative heideggerians (like Hubert Dreyfus and Albert Borgmann) than progressive ones, but still, isn’t it the job of critical theory to articulate more clearly the problems caused by digital environnements. Doesn’t looking at reddit, even if you select carefully your sub-reddit, sometimes seems to you like staring at your refrigerator while you’re not hungry? You get information about reality but are never engaged by this information.
  
Do you think the opposition between digital links-sharing environments and “good old real spaces” has something to do with this kind of disengagement? Any thoughts, comments or links on that?

&gt;It consists of the 'work' required to enforce, win plausibility for and command as legitimate a decoding of
the event within the limit of dominant definitions in which it has been connotatively signified. Terni has remarked:


&gt;&gt;By the word reading we mean not only the capacity to identify and decode a certain number of signs, but also the subjective capacity to put them into a creative relation between themselves and with other signs: a capacity which is, by itself, the condition for a complete awareness of one's total environment.

And this footnote:

P.Terni, ‘Memorandum’, Council of Europe Colloquy on ‘Understanding Television’ (University of Leicester 1973).

I have no idea who 'P.Terni' is, and can find no record of any of his/her writings. P.Terni is who I am interested in.

The following is  the citation appended to the Hall reading itself:

For an expansion of this argument, see Stuart Hall, ‘The external/internal dialectic in broadcasting’, 4th Symposium on Broadcasting (University of Manchester 1972), and ‘Broadcasting and the state: the independence/impartiality couplet’, AMCR Symposium, University of Leicester 1976 (CCCS unpublished paper).

I've searched the University of Leicester library and archives, but am finding nothing. This is probably a huge shot in the dark, but any direction or advice is appreciated

**EDIT 2** I've exhausted all but 2 options: emailing the Council of Europe directly for the document or emailing Hall's wife who is currently a Prof at University College London and asked to ask her husband something for me...

I'm doing both, bets on which route will be more fruitful? Stay tuned!

**EDIT 3** Just heard back from the Council of Europe- they do not have the document I'm looking for but did provide me with another document written by a *Paulo* Terni: http://128.121.10.98/coe/pdfopener?smd=1&amp;md=1&amp;did=722618 .

I worked on it for about three weeks straight and came up with some interesting answers for questions involving ""actors,"" like ""drugs,"" “information,” “anonymity,"" ""addiction,"" ""modernity,"" ""free will,"" and ""power”. Using Latour's approach, I trace the network of actors traversing various domains: the HBO television show The Wire, the cognitive and functional evolution of brain matter, initial molecular observations of the development and decay of the human tooth, and in particular, my own complex experiences online and in the world.

The abstract is below. If you are interested in commenting on it, let me know and I'll add you to the googledoc. The paper is 10 000 words and includes over twenty sources. As I wrote, I realized that I needed more space (and time) to explore my ideas, so I dove in and took the plunge. In the end I learned some pretty fascinating things.

EDIT: Disclaimer- this a grad school paper- it's not going to be accessible to everyone, it is heavy on literary and critical theory as well as metaphysics.

High Life: Affect and Anonymity in the User Mode of Existence

The crisis of modern life is experienced through various complex relations between anonymous, heterogeneous, networked “actors,” (inter)acting though relations simultaneously material (between objects and things) and semiotic (between concepts and discourse), both in the world and online. Affect immanently mediates these processural relations–knowingly or not–and can be traced in, between and across space and time. By following Bruno Latour’s interdisciplinary approach, I intend to interrogate the entropic networks of relations being generated, transformed and exchanged in affective cybercultural capital and in societies and cultures around the world. My inquiry will follow these relations wherever they appear, traversing various domains including my own experiences in online material semiotic discourse and the world. My aim is to determine  to what extent affect or affection (that is, love) can be found mediating such complex networks of relations in and between the actors: ""drugs,"" “information,” “anonymity,"" ""addiction,"" ""modernity,"" ""free will,"" ""desire,"" ""crisis,"" ""habit,""”and ""power;” and what potential capacities this work is imbuing and enabling in and among the increasingly self-reflexive, meta-critical, active, discursive and actual individuals, enacting a new “user mode of existence” in the Information Age.

That would allow me to discuss the lack of actual gender issues in the show, the editing/blocking/camera work mentioned by /u/clearguard, the use of genre and the constant references to other works.

**Original post:**

Hey /r/criticaltheory. I have a bit of an issue.

We're currently doing a pretty big paper for university, where I study media- and communication. I decided a while back to try to do some form of postmodern reading of the TV-series Community (I swear I got the idea before PBS did their [""Is Community a Postmodern Masterpiece?""-video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YanhEVEgkYI), even if that inspired me further). But that damn show is so hard to nail down.

I currently have the following options that I've considered. All of them come with some form of problem for me.

1. **A look at how Community deals with genre.** My initial plan was to look at the paintball-episodes, where they play around with various genres - including a whole bunch of action films (Die Hard, Matrix, etc) in the first season to western and sci-fi (primarily Star Wars) in the second season. My main problem here is I have no idea where to start, or even what kind of reading I should actually do. How can I deconstruct and analyse genre in Community in a fulfilling way? Where the f*ck do I even start? This is what I would prefer to do, but I have no idea how to go about it.

2. **A look at gender in Community.** My first idea was to look at the paintball episodes through gender theory, primarily the western episode where one of the female characters are dressed in a more ""sexy"" cowboy outfit. The problem I'm facing here is that Community - at least as far as I read it - is a pretty asexual show. They do some sex jokes, of course, but in general the tone isn't sexual in any way (especially compared to other modern sitcoms, which tend to rely heavily on sex). In short, I have a hard time finding material to work from - even in episodes which presumably are about gender.

3. **Ethnicity.** Again, I run into the same issue as gender. While there are comments about ethnicity, they don't really make a big deal about it. It's simply not an issue.

Community, in my view, is a pretty good example of postmodernism in action. It is reflexive, heavily intertextual, it posists that the viewer is aware of the popular culture references it is constantly making, it tends to deconstruct itself through contradictions (especially the character of Jeff Winger, whose constant speeches tend to contradict themselves while still conveying some form of message the other characters agree with). The character Abed views the world through television, film and other forms of popular culture and often makes comments as the world around him actually *is* a television show (back to being reflexive).

So I'm utterly stumped. I have no idea where to go from here. Either I drop the show and focus on something else, which will leave me in a state of panic since I've already wasted so much time on this, or I find some form of angle. I also can't analyse the show as a whole, I need to focus on one or two episodes (which is why I chose the paintball episodes, since they have a similar theme).

I hope I make any sense here. I realise that a lot of people here won't have seen the show, but perhaps there are pointers you could give me anyway.

So in western magic/metaphysical speak the concept of the corporation is an egregore. I would define the corporation as just the most current form of what I call a ""Trans-historical"" institution. Church, goverment and nations are also transhistorical institutions.

The primary function of a transhistorical institution as I see it, is to be both a dynamo and depository of the symbolic, linguistic and meta-linguistic (Norms, law, divinely sanctioned violence etc). In other words an engine of *doxa*. An interesting question might be is their role in language post, apriori or neither? Why? 50 words or less, be specific.

These transhistorical institutions act as both prisms of language and meaning as well as black holes of language and meaning, think the sassurian model of language- you can change the meaning of a word only in one direction in that once an old usage has been usurped that old meaning will not likely cycle back as a definition for that word. We can see countless examples of this ""institutional"" influence on language in our daily lives. So these large entities function as algorithmic ""black boxes"" that vector only one way. 

This is where the idea of the programming/software realm of language becomes interesting.

Large institutions be they governments, corporations, media or any explicitly public focused mass-managment based entity, employ software
In their deployment of their sole purpose. For any institution this sole purpose is survival and perpetuation whether that is ""maximize profit"" or ""mass-manage resources"".

So in the past these institutions worked with language on the level of doxa or perhaps a Newtonian schema. But now they function on the level of both doxa and meta/molecular in that they now employ software/programming language as well. (Does this have an effect on the ""grammar"" and semantics of programming language as well like it has on doxa? Again, 50 words or less, be specific)

So my point is that while these articles I linked to (the main one has links to similar essays) may be more loose or ""speculative"" than this community is accustomed to, I think that nonetheless, this interpretation of corporation as AI is right in line with McCluhan, Deleuze, Marx and definitely Baudrillards reading of capitalisms machinations.

(It is also kind of the gnostic conspiracy theory par excellence.)

Two months ago I started my first blog to post my theoretical research on the concept of anonymity and received 1300 hits from 50 countries in less than a week. At first I was really excited by the exposure, then I was nevrous and wary when weird things started to happen, then I shut it down completely and disappeared.

Since then I've changed all my passwords, reformatted every device I own and even flashed my router, which is to say, I learned a very valuable  and practical lesson on the very issue that I have been trying to understand abstractly; online, anonymity and vulnerability are two sides of the same coin, and that coin is flipped every instant, with absolutely no certainty whatsoever. No one is ever completely anonymous and anonymity is not some grandiose super-power to taken out of context.

I realize now that basically, I was begging to be messed with, and of course, some undoubtedly very bored individuals out there thought it would be hilarious to do just that. At first I was furious and full of resentment, but since time has passed I've actually grown thankful for the experience. I was foolish, cavalier and oblivious to the practical nature of a phenomenon that I had too quickly become invested in understanding theoretically. As a result, I elided the practical reality that there are millions of people out there who have used and lived this abstraction for way longer than I have tried to think about it, and that maybe they know things, like how to do things and use the Internet in really advanced and robust ways. That is the lesson I've learned, and it is that subtle kind of knowledge that deserves respect and recognition not only by me as a person, but especially any philosopher and theoretician interested in understanding how the Internet is changing us and the world we live in, in very real ways.

As I repopulate this blog I will migrate and update versions of my old posts as I continue my work on understanding the concept of anonymity and sharing it with anyone who's interested. No more am I under any illusions of my own position as a so-called 'anonymous user' and both in my work and my life I will continue to take care to be respectful to the nuances and complexity of what anonymity consists of and how it affects us as users.

As always, I thrive of feedback and criticism. Everything I post can be commented on- I look forward to some interesting exchanges.

What I want to draw attention to is the more than commonplace idea that most people are idiots, except for our friends. I saw a Jimmy Johns advertisement before the election that read something along the lines of ""Will you do what it takes to live more in one day than most people will live in their whole lives?"" People are (supposedly) boring masses, and somehow I think about zombie movies when I think about this. Youtube becomes a common viewpoint onto a misguided and disheartening group of people. **I think that if there's anything that unites people it's its hatred of people on the internet!** What a fantastic revolutionary front! 

I mean, how does this ever coincide with the idea of a democracy? I mean what does it really say about the state of democracy today when most people think most people are idiots?!

And a timely hip hop song case in point: a major hip hop artist makes a song about how he doesn't want to meet anymore people. [""Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9OWiH9XtV4)

I feel that the concept of 'us' is declining, a 'us' among all people, and instead you can only have empathy with a small group of people who are unlike most people. Am I making sense? I'm trying to say that the general outlook on people is pretty grim, and I wanted to talk about misanthropy's role in ideology today.

*Writing and Difference* - Derrida

*The Animal that Therefore I Am* - Derrida

*Specters of Marx* - Derrida

*Dissemination* - Derrida

I smite unworthy beings or becomings with my mighty backspace, every keystroke a Big Bang in theory and practice.*

This is the user's creative power. Endless anonymous blurbs written by users across the world as if present and face-to-face are becoming something new. The only meaningful identifying characteristic of each individual being (really) is hidden in a field of static. 

It is the anon's style of use that matters in the din. On the internet, everything is just 'zeroes' and 'ones,' it all comes down to how they are used. This principle gives the anon's voice its power, the innate (cap)ability to use. Usually, most words transmitted by anon’s refer to ideas or thoughts which signify deferred meaning which poses as the status quo. Some users (most) tend to perceive these superfluous signs instead of their faint, affective signification.

Others tend to have a greater capacity to perceive affective signification, these anonmalous users operate in a different, creative and unique mode. They are better able to grasp the subtle affect of other user’s style amid the noise and are able to choose to give it mind. In the economy of cybercultural capital, the only accepted currency is paying attention. Some users with this greater capacity to consistently think differently tend to circulate with anon’s of similar affective capacities, abilities and tendencies. Once these flows begin to stabilize, the already-more-coherent relationality of the assemblage complexifies and destabilizes again. Inevitably, new numbers of outlier anomalies begin to resonate (and become) in similar and even more complex styles. Accrete, repeat. 

In this way, the most affective anons tend to strengthen and radiate the dialogic (mutually beneficial) stability in a given network assemblage. This affective concatenation amidst the chaos is possible thanks to the distinct style of being of certain anon’s, in certain network assemblages, maintaining stabilization, by the greater or lesser concentration of affective users, occasionally articulating a mode of being as such, in the same voice. This episode of expression is a moment of emergence of the anonymous user volition. And it is a voice that will only get louder as the serial of episodes proceeds.",,False,self,t5_2tmcb,1360069412.0,,,True,t3_17s0fe,http://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/17s0fe/theorization_1_user_mode_on/,

______________________

Today the modern experience is becoming concretized through the mechanical organization of material semiotic discursive relational processes, affectively generated by the fluid vital motion of anonymous actors in and between websites and city streets.

The Internet provides disillusioned and alienated moderns access to a new mechanism for experiencing their modern roots which reach back over a half-millennia long process of modernization. These relations in contemporary material semiotic discourse exist in gradients of anonymity. By dint of this field, a user's capacity to affect choice and decipher various meaning from the cacophony of local and global multitude's information maelstrom, and enabling critical dialogic engage with potentially robust intensity, determined by the perceived anonymity of a given relational experience in relation to the user's actual heterogeneity from the perspective of other circulating networks of rogue or dominating power relations. The effect of such accumulations of the many little choices made by and among vast numbers of users across the world, all the time, is the emergence of a new kind of will power, the force of anonymous user volition.",,False,self,t5_2tmcb,1358018312.0,,,True,t3_16fugz,http://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/16fugz/my_thoughts_on_modern_life_in_user_mode/,

So if I go to the Grand Canyon and see it from an angle I've never seen even pictures of, and I'm not noticing every single hue of red or every single formation on the rocks, but I'm still seeing the Grand Canyon so that I recognize that landscape as the Grand Canyon, isn't that familiarity? 

Side note: If you think familiarity requires some sort of work, just make me a painter whose job is to register the Grand Canyon.

A quote from the book: ""Familiarity, in accordance with which Dasein, as being with one another, knows its way about in its public environment.""

EDIT: Do you think that what I'm talking about is more in the Time side of the problem than in the Being? I think that might be it. I think if you start talking about familiarity with memory, that's just a familiarity with time as part of the equation.

The text I will be working from here is Wlad Godzich’s 1984 translation of Tzvetan Todorov’s critique (Todorov and Julia Kristeva were instrumental in bringing Bakhtin's work into the economy theoretical discourse analysis in France in the mid 1970’s) of work produced as early as 1926 by the “Bakhtin circle,” which includes Valentin Voloshinov and P. N. Medvedev. The concatenation and evolution of the critical conceptualizations of the utterance over time is itself interesting to examine in terms of who the “author” of the theory of the utterance is exactly, and really, does this question even matter? For the purposes of this paper it does not, however authorial anonymity may or may not prove to have some bearing on the following analysis. When the “Bakhtin circle” is mentioned it is done as a gestures to all of these individual’s ideas with no specific hierarchy in mind.

The “verbal utterance” as conceived by the Bakhtin circle is an active, expressive performance that is always already limited by protocols and relations determined by norms contingent on specific social and historical contexts and conditions of enunciation and reception. As such, every utterance as a personal enunciation is made by a social individual in an idiosyncratic style for a particular audience whose reception and response may or may not be knowingly integrated into its expression. The style of an utterance may be analyzed to reveal previously inaccessible evaluative signification, consciously or unconsciously implied in and between dialogic exchanges. From this the Bakhtin circle asserts that the meaning of any utterance is related to and contingent upon the meaning of its precursor utterances and their social and historical conditions of expression. The Bakhtin circle uses the term “verbal communication” describe the system(at)ic interpretive economy at work in any dialogic exchange between at least two heterogeneous entities or stylistic utterances relating, albeit anonymously, in and across discursive genres over time.

In Roland Barthes’ 1957 book *Mythologies*, the personal, social and discursive limitations of language, cultural expression and individual thought are conceptualized as communicative messages mediated and spoken by myth. For Barthes, myth is a mode of signification which mediates any uniquely stylistic message conveyed by discourse and “the way in which [myth] utters” always contains traces of mythic data which stick to every message (107). Here, Barthes uses the word ‘utters’ in the Sausserian sense of a speech act, not in the sense of the Bakhtinian conceptualization outlined above. Nonetheless, Barthes’ mythic speech functions like Bakhtin's dialogic principle in that it predicts its reception and implies that no message is ever absolutely originary or a priori to social life. By examining the context of enunciation and reception of messages mediated by myth’s signifying consciousness, Barthes is able to decode concealed meaning and reveal the “social usage” added to any mythic utterance while discounting its substance (108). Barthes uses “semiology” to describe his theory which traces and accesses myth and its hidden modes of its signification that are transmitted through discourse and history in order to understand and describe how its anonymous meaning operates and mediates the individual and social levels of thought and culture.

For Barthes and the Bakhtin circle then, the social and historical conditions in which any message or utterance is expressed and the manner in which a social individual uses their own unique style to ensure their message is heard above the din of mythic preconception, generic convention, and traditional assumptions. If we can treat a text as a single, as a cohesive expression of a particular author’s message or utterance, then the style, intonation and modes of expression becomes essential to decoding the traces of myth, ideology or genre.

Of little interest, and who would bother to make nonviolence *interesting*?
