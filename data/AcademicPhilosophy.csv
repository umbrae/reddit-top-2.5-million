1298289688.0,65,self.AcademicPhilosophy,fpidh,I think an “ask philosophy” subreddit would be really neat.,76,11,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/fpidh/i_think_an_ask_philosophy_subreddit_would_be/,"[r/askscience](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/) is a success. Working scientists openly engaging with the public through the reddit medium? Marvellous. The panel structure is genius. 

Redditors can be an inquisitive bunch. Many, as it were, are willing to pose their queries in earnest to those who are qualified to answer. It looks to me that a good deal of the questions that come up in r/askscience are slightly to largely philosophical in nature, and might benefit from a philosopher's touch. Yet there are no working philosophers on the panel, nor should there be.

I propose r/askphilosophy be created. An open place for folks to ask real live working philosophers questions of and about philosophy.

Please call me out if you think it's a bad idea, if something like it already exists, or if this is the wrong place to discuss such a thing. Would the forum too likely be a complete mess? Is it feasible? Are there enough philosophers here that would be willing to jump on the panel? Are there enough people asking questions in earnest? Could students exploit it? Part of the purpose r/askscience had from the beginning was to clean up r/science, perhaps this could do the same for r/philosophy.

I've known some incredible philosophers in my life. Masters of queries. Wizards of response. So grateful I am to have spent time with them. But I know that if I hadn't had the opportunity to attend university, this part of my life would be absent.

What are three (not in any order) common misconceptions *you* hear in, around, or about Philosophy which irk you.  I'd love to hear what [/r/AcademicPhilosophy](/r/AcademicPhilosophy) has to say.

Here are mine:

* **The *'it's all relative'* aphorism.**  I dislike hearing, especially among young college students, this newfound love of moral relativity.  I think people confuse diversity and cultural appreciation with a necessary commitment to moral relativism.  Rarely do I meet someone who says 'it's all relative', and has a profound understanding of the arguments in favor of moral relativism.
* **That Philosophy is inexorably intertwined with God.**  Often times when I tell friends and family I study Philosophy, I'm asked (as if I have any authority) if I believe in God.  I've been accused of studying Philosophy to 'discover' God, or 'disprove' God.  I understand why the question is out there, I just don't care as much as people expect.
* **That we're 'experts in nothing'.** Recently I saw Lawrence Krauss and Richard Dawkins discuss Krauss' new book at ASU.  In the interview, Krauss pokes fun at Philosophers many times, citing their 'attack' on his new book in which he redefines the term, 'nothing'.  He responds that Philosophers are 'experts' in nothing.  Throughout the interview, however, he engages in metaphysics, cites Bertrand Russell, and talks about the 'Anthropic Principle'.  Nothing annoys me more than pop-scientists who disparage Philosophy all while relying on it and performing it.

I know this may not be very interesting to all of you, but I'd love to see a variety of replies.

Thanks.


**EDIT**: If anyone is interested in the Krauss comment, it's [here on youtube, watch: (47:18-50:00)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUe0_4rdj0U#t=47m18s).  His entire book is based on the premise that 'nothing' includes the presence of the laws of quantum mechanics.  His 'nothing' is, therefore, ""nothing + certain laws of quantum mechanics and gravity"", which when he's criticized for calling that nothing, he argues that philosophers must be experts in 'nothing'.",,False,self,t5_2r7v0,True,,,True,t3_slha7,http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/slha7/what_are_3_common_philosophy_misconceptions_which/,

The URL is [http://openleaf.me](http://openleaf.me) and it is a student-to-student networking site for sharing resources and getting study help from students all over who share your major and courses. There is also a news feed for each campus.

We have created a [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgqCTrnb2Oo) for you to see what the website is all about before registering.

The only information required to sign up is a .edu email address(to verify you are a student). As avid users of the internet we know that this is a lot to ask so if you feel uncomfortable about giving that information away and still wanted to try out the site I will create you an account if you pm me or you can send me an email at enopanen@openleaf.me

Hopefully those of you that try out the site will find it to be a good source of information at some point. We built the site with the theme of open-data and open-information in mind and promise not to do anything sketchy with your personal information.

TL:DR [http://openleaf.me](http://openleaf.me) is an awesome student resource website that we built this summer and we won't sell your email address if you sign up.

Think of it as some kind of open-source method of studying philosophy, if you will. Over time, I'm positive that we could progress in our researches and - who knows? - perhaps even break ground by arriving at unprecendented conclusions. 

Of course, we all know this wouldn't be easy. In fact, far from that, it would be a very difficult and a seriously time-consuming effort. All research is, afterall. However, that shouldn't stop us. On the contrary, precisely because the pursuit of philosophical knowledge is, at times, rather daunting, I believe we should use this magnificent tool that is reddit to our full benefit.

I suggested eliminating the circumstances that make illegals desirable; mainly, labor costs. If Americans were willing to work for $5-$10/hr in jobs where they currently make twice that, businesses won't have much incentive to employ illegals. Of course this always sparks a fight about living standards and someone argues that they have a ""right"" to a living wage. I disagree. Of course politicians can get a lot of votes by supporting this position because, obviously, it's very appealing to lots of people. That doesn't make it true, for the same reason we don't have a right to happiness, or to own a home. We have a right to pursue these things with equal liberty under the law, but once they are guaranteed by the government, they can only be given after they have been taken from someone else. This is why we are not entitled to such things, including ""living wages"" because it's impossible to provide to an individual except at the direct expense of someone else. 

I guess what this comes down to, is how I define a ""right.""

I was under the assumption that, in the U.S. at least, rights are conditions necessary for survival without negatively impacting the efforts of another. Rights are also inherent, hence, they are guaranteed to all people equally. If this is true, then we can not have a ""right"" to a job, living wages or homes, because those all come at expense to someone else. We can only ever have the right to pursue those ends.

1322157547.0,29,self.AcademicPhilosophy,mo27p,Comments requested on a new draft of my book--Replacing Truth,38,9,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/mo27p/comments_requested_on_a_new_draft_of_my/,"It's coming out with Oxford next year, and I have a chance to make another round of changes first.  Comments from you guys on earlier drafts have been very helpful.  

[Here](http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/scharp1/ReplacingTruth4.3.pdf) is the pdf.  

Below is a summary (from the Introduction).  

Chapter One is a brief survey of work on truth in the analytic tradition.  The goal is present a novel way of thinking about the literature rather than an introduction to the particular views out there, so it presupposes some familiarity with the contemporary discussion.  I distinguish between theories of the nature of truth, philosophical approaches to the aletheic paradoxes, and logical approaches to the aletheic paradoxes.  Logical approaches offer a mathematical model for our language and truth predicate, while philosophical approaches provide an empirical interpretation of the mathematical model.  The distinction is not new, but without it, one is likely to be confused about which theories are genuine rivals.  Once these three types of theories are on the table, I consider combinations of philosophical approaches and logical approaches; then the focus turns to what I call unified theories of truth, which include a view on the nature of truth, a philosophical approach, and a logical approach as components.  

On my view, truth is an inconsistent concept.  Saying what that means is the job of Chapter Two, which explains the basics of inconsistent concepts.  Chapters Three and Four includes several arguments for the claim that truth is an inconsistent concept.  The first, which I call the obvious argument, is the most intuitive and accessible.  The other three arguments depend on considerations that arise in conjunction with revenge paradoxes, which are ubiquitous and affect approaches to the aletheic paradoxes.  In Chapter Five, I present some of the views that fall in the inconsistency tradition and argue that each one is unacceptable.  The main point of this chapter is that an inconsistency approach to the aletheic paradoxes should offer replacements for truth.  

We need to replace our inconsistent concept of truth with two concepts, which I call ascending truth and descending truth.  Not only do the replacement concepts perform the explanatory work we ask of truth, they avoid the paradoxes caused by truth as well.  Moreover, one can use them as the basis for a theory of our inconsistent concept of truth itself.  Thus, there are really two essential parts to the view I recommend.  First, there is the prescriptive theory, which explains the replacement concepts.  It says how we should expand our conceptual repertoire and provides reasons to think that this expansion will not just result in the same old problems we find with truth.  Second, there is the descriptive theory, which explains our defective concept of truth—what principles it obeys and why it gives rise to paradoxes.  One of the fundamental commitments of the entire project is that the descriptive theory should not appeal to the concept of truth; instead, it uses the replacement concepts.  Accordingly, Chapter Six contains the prescriptive theory and explains how the replacement concepts work.  This prescriptive theory amounts to a logical approach and a philosophical approach to the aletheic paradoxes.   Chapter Seven presents a view on the nature of truth that is based on metrological naturalism.  It introduces some measurement theory and shows how to understand Davidson’s theory of truth in light of this material.  Finally, it contains a metrological theory of ascending and descending truth.  Chapter Eight covers many of the issues that arise when one tries to replace a concept like truth that is so central to our way of thinking about ourselves, the world, and the relationship between them.  In particular, it gives an overview of the relations among the concepts of ascending truth and descending truth and many of the concepts that are closely tied to truth, including validity, meaning, assertion, knowledge, predication, and reference.  

The central claim of the prescriptive theory is that, for certain purposes, we ought to use two new concepts, ascending truth and descending truth, instead of truth.  Ascending truth is like truth in that the inference from a declarative sentence p to ‘p is ascending true’ is valid.  It differs from truth in that the inference ‘p is ascending true’ to p is not always valid (although it is valid for the vast majority of sentences).  Descending truth is like truth in that the inference from ‘p is descending true’ to p is valid for any declarative sentence.  However, it differs from truth in that the inference from p to ‘p is descending true’ is not always valid (although, again, it is valid for the vast majority of sentences).  Together, ascending truth and descending truth can do the work we require of truth without giving rise to paradoxes of any kind.  Moreover, the theory of ascending truth and descending truth is compatible with classical logic, and it imposes no expressive restrictions on the languages that contain ascending truth predicates and descending truth predicates.  

Chapter Nine introduces the descriptive theory, on which a truth predicate of a natural language is assessment-sensitive, which means that it has the same content in every context of utterance, but its extension (i.e., the set of things that are true) depends on a context of assessment.  Contexts of assessment model situations in which a person interprets someone’s utterance.  From different contexts of assessment, the truth predicate has different extensions.  The descriptive theory employs the concepts of ascending truth and descending truth, and they determine how the extension of the truth predicate varies across contexts of assessment.  This assessment-sensitive theory of truth solves the aletheic paradoxes, it is compatible with classical logic and all the expressive resources we have in natural language, and it does not give rise to any new paradoxes.  Chapter Ten considers issues that arise for a language that has a truth predicate, an ascending truth predicate, and a descending truth predicate.  It also contains some objections and replies to the unified theory of truth that consists of the prescriptive theory (consisting of the philosophical approach, logical approach, and metrological naturalism for ascending and descending truth from Chapters Six, Seven, and Eight) and the descriptive theory (consisting of the philosophical approach, logical approach, and metrological naturalism for truth from Chapter Nine).  A brief Conclusion follows Chapter Ten.

Second, I have noticed some downvotes on legitimately submitted articles.

So far, I have seen few of these types of submissions, so it would be great if we could allow those submissions that deserve the points (most do) to float to the top and not be punished for arbitrary reasons. 

In short, if you are a reflexive downvoter, please don't do that here without just cause. Thanks.

That's not really important, but what *is* important is that school is beginning again, and likely at least a few of you are going to be actively studying or researching.

As such, I would like to make a call to all the members of *AcademicPhilosophy* that over the course of the school year you make a point of sharing one class reading, one journal article, one book, or one public lecture that you found in your scholarly activities that you believe would benefit the audience at *AcademicPhilosophy*.

If you are teaching a class, share your favorite assigned reading; if you are a student, share the best article you read for your favorite class; if you are writing a paper, provide us with a main source for your topic with a brief explanation of why you think it is important, etc... 

As an example, I recently posted a series of articles that constituted a portion of my research for a particular paper I wrote several years ago - [they are compiled here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/d8jpt/kants_theory_of_space_and_time_video_teaching/c0yddxw). I am placing this call for contributions in a similar spirit, such that sharing your own work will both benefit a wider audience and hopefully increase your understanding of the material you chose to present. 

If you are interested in doing this, or contributing in any way you believe would be beneficial to this sub-reddit, please let me know here or by PM. I will do my best to reward those who participate as contributors in whatever way I can, which isn't much, but one thing that can be done is to add your username to the approved contributors list (this means nothing other than your posts likely wont be counted as spam by mistake). Further, quality submissions could be highlighted at [DepthHub](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub) to try and give your content more views. And of course, good links get the karma and the attention of a favorable audience and the chance to converse with your peers about something you may be newly expert in. If you can think of any other ways we can help to celebrate and distinguish valuable contributions from the community members, please leave your ideas in the comments. 

Also, I want to thank all the contributors we've had to date for all the links they've contributed to *AcademicPhilosophy* (especially my co-mod **[Ashok](http://www.reddit.com/user/ashok)** for all his original writings and excellent links). These contributors have done a great job of bringing valuable content to a wider, more studious, audience. Let's keep it up in this academic year.

Please also don't forget **self-authored** submissions are also welcome - if you have a paper you think will do well, but want someone to read it before you hand it in, share it here!

Best of luck to everyone in the new academic year, and keep submitting links! Thanks.

1366613129.0,26,self.AcademicPhilosophy,1cumld,Let's talk a little bit about what we want to achieve at AcademicPhilosophy,31,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/1cumld/lets_talk_a_little_bit_about_what_we_want_to/,"I don't need to tell any of you philosophy is an enormous field. Any step taken in it in any direction opens a vast array of questions as well as other fields and subfields that need to be addressed just to understand one's own topic.

What's crazy is how I'm talking about the stuff *directly* necessary for getting a grasp on a topic. When we consider related questions and topics, everything just explodes. I'm bringing this up because I remember how overwhelmed I felt as an undergraduate in philosophy. I remember how the work I was doing on Wittgenstein - and by work, I was just trying to understand the bare minimum, like what was going on with the slabs and pointing in the *Investigations* - felt like it had nothing to do with Plato or half the other philosophy I was trying to read. I couldn't get a sense of why philosophy was a field.

Now that I've read a ton, I can see the links. Sort of. They're still difficult to describe. I might need to cheat and talk about how ethical propositions in way resemble aesthetic propositions for Wittgenstein, how meaning and truth are rather curious with regard to both categories. And I might need to say that Plato's forms seem to critically depend on questions such as ""What is justice?"" or ""What is good?""

But that's cheating. I went to particular interpretations of particular texts and jammed two accounts together. They may be about ethics, but they might also be about propositions and forms. Or a bunch of other things. It all depends on how you see things, how you want to frame the issue.

And that ""framing the issue"" is important, and I don't think a lot of it is happening - well, really, anywhere. I've worked with enough students to know the better ones have talking points that are reliable for tests and answering professors and maybe even the odd person curious about one's work. But the heart of philosophy is coming up with a question, talking through it, realizing how many other questions there are. 

I think the linkdump approach to this subreddit is important, don't get me wrong. You deserve the best resources possible: if anything posted helps you in your studies or just generally, please let the poster know.

But I also think the linkdump approach is overwhelming more than a few of us. It's tough to critically engage everything and that can be very discouraging. And I don't want anyone getting discouraged regarding philosophy, because there's always room to say or ask something thoughtful or interesting. I remember that article recently posted about a teacher walking away from teaching prisoners. Nothing against prisoners, btw: I hope they can rehabilitate, I hope they can rejoin society and be productive and happy. But ""prison"" got me thinking on another level about disgust - not just as a convention which bonds a society, but the worry that getting used to some things can dull all moral sense, maybe even all sense.

We need to get some way of showing that philosophy is engaging and interesting on an everyday level, methinks. I'm not sure. That's why this post - I want to hear what you have to say.",,False,self,t5_2r7v0,False,,,True,t3_1cumld,http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/1cumld/lets_talk_a_little_bit_about_what_we_want_to/,moderator

We will be offering, at the least, one spot for a paper from an undergraduate attending university elsewhere. Although a printed issue at this time is not guaranteed, we will be offering a digital version up for free. If you would like, you can visit the journal through the university website [here](http://philosophy.tamu.edu/Academics/Undergrad/Societies%20and%20Publications.html). Tentative schedule is to publish the Fall 2011 issue in early December. 

Call for Papers:

""Aletheia, the undergraduate journal of philosophy at Texas A&amp;M University, is seeking guest submissions for its Fall 2011 issue.

What we are looking for in a paper is serious philosophical engagement with an issue or philosopher of some sort. It does not need to be conclusive nor expansive, but it does need to display critical reflection and mature philosophical exploration of its topic.

Please send submissions to aletheia.tamu+reddit@gmail.com in a .odt, .pdf, or .doc format. Submissions should meet the following requirements:

* Double-spaced, and styled to a specific guide (preferably to the Chicago Manual of Style).
* 8 to 16 pages.
* A cover page with your name, class year, university affiliation, and email.

Though not required, the editorial staff would appreciate a brief abstract that summarizes the purpose of your paper.

Deadline is November 1st, 2011.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact us at the email given above.""

Two things that we would be most appreciative of would be, if possible, to send your paper through your university provided email and to send it to ""aletheia.tamu+reddit@gmail.com"".

Before I get into it, I should say that I have nothing against continental philosophy. I find almost all of it very interesting and worthy of study (hence my taking the class) — it's not my particular interest, but whatever. I feel like a well-rounded philosopher should know what other philosophers are doing (even if they do things differently, and disagree with you). In other words, my issue is not with continental philosophy.

So, what was odd about the class was the way the professor handled the Continental/Analytic distinction. He spent almost an hour, completely unprovoked, talking about the distinction between the two ""camps,"" about how there was a division in terms of who will cite who (even on the same subjects), and about what he felt was a strong divide in most departments in terms of hiring decisions and which faculty members associate with each other.

Contrast this with the two 20th Century Analytic classes I've taken in which the ""distinction"" was never even talked about, let alone given an hour of class time, and you can see why this was so odd for me. In previous classes, it simply was not an issue the professor considered important enough for class time.

The professor of this Continental Philosophy class also spent a good deal of time talking about how much he hated Gilbert Ryle and A.J. Ayer. Which, to be honest, seemed a bit unnecessary to me.

I'm curious to hear others' thoughts on this. For me, it was just incredibly strange to hear so much fire and brimstone rhetoric over a distinction I don't really give much weight to.",,False,self,t5_2r7v0,False,,,True,t3_d569p,http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/d569p/i_spent_1_hour_and_15_minutes_in_a_20th_century/,

But then you get a split, and come to Analytic Philosophy, where you'll start with Frege's 1892 paper ""On Sense and Reference."" 

I was wondering if anyone could speak themselves to this transition, or point me to some further reading on the topic?

This bit was interesting:

&gt; Physicist Frank Tipler, influenced by Teilhard's Omega Point idea, developed the notion of the Aleph - that the ultimate fate of the universe is to be entirely saturated by self awareness. Perhaps the importance of Tipler is that his was the first attempt to provide a teleological argument from the point of view science; the argument of his books and papers going something like: IF the current rules of physics are right, THEN the ultimate fate of the universe is the following.

If true, ""movement toward self-awareness"" or ""expanding self-awareness"" would be a superset of technological progress, progress in infrastructure (is progress in infrastructure progress in technology?), and so on.

I've googled ""theories of progress"" for the past hour or so and have found remarkably little. Most just seem to define ""progress"" in terms of social/tech/economic, but if technological progress can refer to the broader construction of systems (and development of meta-arguments) and anything efficiency-related, then it would seem that everything could be classified as technological progress depending on the definition, except for social progress where change occurs by attitude and not by model development.

More specifically, I'm very interested in 'Pittsburgh school' philosophy (Sellars, McDowell, Brandom) and don't know of many programs that specialize in this approach to philosophy. 

From what I understand, this style of philosophy is considered a bit of a niche, since it's relying pretty heavily on certain readings of Kant and Hegel in support of arguments regarding (largely) analytic issues. The two programs that I've been told are well-regarded in this type of philosophy are the University of Pittsburgh (obviously) and the University of Chicago.

Presumably this is because Descartes is a rationalist and people associate the two. However, it was recently pointed out to me that Descartes' cogito should really be considered a posteriori. Descartes knows he exists because he is aware of having conscious experience - so his knowledge of his existence is justified by experience, namely his own self-awareness of his thinking. This is a posteriori.

If this is true, it follows as a consequence that all knowledge for Descartes is a posteriori. Since the first principle of his foundationalist theory of knowledge is that he exists, all further knowledge must depend on, and be epistemically based upon, this knowledge. So if this is a posteriori, then everything is.

&gt; What Eia had done, was to first interview the Norwegian social scientists on issues like sexual orientation, gender roles, violence, education and  race, which are heavily politicized in the Norwegian science community. Then he translated the interviews into English and took them to well-known British and American scientists like Robert Plomin, Steven Pinker, Anne Campbell, Simon Baron-Cohen, Richard Lippa, David Buss, and others, and got their comments. **To say that the American and British scientists were surprised by what they heard, is an understatement.**

&gt; I looked recently at the Norwegian popular science television series ""Brainwashing."" In seven sections the Norwegian comedian Harald Eia explores the degree to which various differences between people can be attributed to biological or social factors.

[Race Taboo on TV](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sv&amp;u=http://web.archive.org/web/00000000000000/http://www.dagsavisen.no/kultur/article480122.ece) 4/13/2010

&gt; We need to talk about taboo topics, without being branded as racists, say Shout editor Majoran Vivekananthan of ""Brainwashing"" fame.

&gt; For 17 years, gender research has been built up through its own research program in the Research Council. The last firårsperioden has been reduced by approx. 56 million for research in gender studies.

&gt; Last spring, Norwegian gender studied received massive criticism in connection with the NRK series Brainwashing. Trout believes part of the criticism has been real, and points out that there are many opinions about this even among sex researchers themselves. But the debate has damaged reputation of research.

[Great Interest in Brainwashing](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;u=http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/Kjempeinteresse-for-Hjernevask-5320246.html) 3/3/2010

&gt; Curious and enthusiastic TV viewers bombarded Harald Eia and Ole Martin Ihle with questions during the chat with Aftenposten.no readers.

&gt; Are men more interested in sex than women? Some believe that this is true, some not. But what science says?

&gt; A person who has attempted to ascertain this is the Norwegian comedian and journalist Harald Eia. For more than a year since he took up this and several other sociological issues in a series of documentaries for NRK's ​​behalf. The series created a major debate about gender scientific culture. Now, during last autumn also put Norwegian counterpart to the Council closed its special focus on gender studies. Generally it is considered to be linked to EIAs TV programs.

Today I Googled the host's name ""Harald eia"" and the word ""brainwash,"" and clicked ""Past month"" to see what had cropped up recently (the videos appeared with English subtitles two months ago).  The following results include a promising 4chan thread:

I have gotten the impression that philosophy texts are objects that are meant to be all scribbled on, but I don't know how to go about scribbling on them. No one has explained this to me. Given that the second year looks a lot more booky than the first, I'm thinking I should learn. So: how do you do it?

Sometimes I've gone into a book with pencil in hand, but I have no instincts telling me what I should do with the pencil. At some point I think ""that looks like I should underline it"", but once I get into that mindset pretty much *everything* looks like I should underline it, which is obviously not helpful. Then I give up.

So if anyone has any advice, I'd appreciate it. What exactly are you doing when you annotate a philosophy text? What kind of margin notes are necessary and what kind of margin notes are pointless? What needs highlighting and what does not? Do you have weird symbols and colours and different underlining-shapes? Do you have a strict system or do you go by instinct (and which instincts)? And how do you stop it all from being an incomprehensible mess? I realise different people work differently. That's fine, a variety of ideas is welcome.

And a second, less important question: how did you learn to annotate like you do now? Did someone teach you, or did you make it up as you went along, or some of both?

1350516137.0,17,self.AcademicPhilosophy,11npb3,"Thoughts about Nietzsche's First Publication, ""The Birth of Tragedy""",22,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/11npb3/thoughts_about_nietzsches_first_publication_the/,"I read Nietzsche's ""BoT"" as an assigned reading for a German history class. I read it as Nietzsche trying to get a number of things off his chest: what he's learned from Schopenhauer, what he loves in Wagner, German poets and thinkers in general, but most importantly--his appreciation of Plato (specifically the dialogue ""Phaedrus"").

These are some considerations about the text, written with the hope of clarifying the above assumptions:

* The work is 25 chapters. More fundamentally though, it is a seven part book, with four chapters composing a Part (with a singular exception, Chapter 25). Therefore,

Chapters 1-4:     Part 1

Chapters 5-8:     Part 2

Chapters 9-12:   Part 3

Chapters 13-16: Part 4

Chapters 17-20: Part 5

Chapters 21-24: Part 6

Chapter 25:       Part 7

* The four part structure is a reflection of Schopenhauer's ""Fourfold Root of Sufficient Reason."" This is easiest seen in Part 1, where each chapter is a poetization of Schopenhauer's Kantian language (like how the law of homogeneity and the law of specification become Apollo and Dionysus). Hence,

Chapter 1: Character of Apollo (principium individuationis)  = Becoming

Chapter 2: Character of Dionysus                                      = Knowing

Chapter 3: Apollonian Culture (the gods called Olympians)   = Being

Chapter 4: Dionysian Culture (either Titans or Barbarians)   = Willing

* Chapter 4 concludes with Nietzsche claiming ""four major artistic periods."" Quote:

""Up to this point I have set out at some length what I observed at the opening of this essay: how the Dionysian and the Apollonian ruled the Hellenic world in a constantly new sequence of births, one after the other, mutually intensifying each other; how, out of the “first” age, with its battles against the Titans and its austere popular philosophy, the Homeric world developed under the rule of the Apollonian drive for beauty; how this “naive” magnificence was swallowed up once more by the breaking out of the Dionysian torrent; and how, in opposition to this new power, the Apollonian erected the rigid majesty of Doric art and the Doric world view. If in this way the earlier history of the Greeks, in the struggle of those two hostile principles, falls into four major artistic periods, we are now impelled to ask more about the final stage of this development and striving, in case we should consider, for example, the last attained period, the one of Doric art, the summit and intention of those artistic impulses...""

* In the first period, there is nothing but immediate cause and effect--""one after the other."" In the second period (Note: in Kaufmann's translation, ""out of the ""first"" age...,"" is, ""out of the ""bronze"" age...,"" which I see as fitting the Schopenhauerian framework better because it captures the transition from matter, which concerns the first root of sufficient reason, to abstract concepts, which concerns the second root), a necessary drive for beauty was engendered by the Titans and folk of the country. In the third period, we experience how Apollo is both creator and parcel of the Olympians via ""naivete,"" which is the closest Apollo comes to Dionysus (which strikes me as a Nietzschean poetization of Schopenahuer's example of geometry). In the fourth period, Dionysus approaches Apollo in the form of strife, i.e. the spirit of war--immediate will

* The seven part composition is Nietzsche's understanding of Plato's ""Symposium,"" which he would sometime later refer to as ""the experience of seven solitudes."" (The main cast of ""Symposium"" is 7 characters: Phaedrus, Pausanias, Eryximachus, Aristophanes, Agathon, Socrates, and Alcibiades) This leads me to ""Phaedrus.""

* ""The Birth of Tragedy"" is a modern interpretation of Plato's ""Phaedrus."" Really, it is a rewriting of ""Phaedrus."" Lines in the dialogue are expressed by Nietzsche as paragraphs. The dramatic interplay between Socrates and Phaedrus about the lover and non-lover is represented by Nietzsche with the Apollonian and Dionysian impulses. I will for the time being point out some of the more 'convincing' passages which suggest Nietzsche's reproduction of ""Phaedrus."" There is not enough room to post the structure I've so far worked out. Both [""BoT""](http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/Nietzsche/tragedy_all.htm#tragedy) and [""Phaedrus""](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhaedrus) can be found online if you do not have your own copies to check the references--though I don't like the translations.

Comparisons:

* Chapter 1, paragraph 4 = Phaedrus' initial explication at the very beginning of the dialogue about Lysias' unique speech above lovers and non-lovers. As seen in Ch. 1, para. 4 Nietzsche explains Schopenhauer's unique belief about a philosopher's ability to differnetiate reality from illusion. As Phaedrus marks himself as ""Lysiasian"" so does Nietzsche show himself a ""Schopenhauerian.""

* Chapter 1, paragraph 5 = Socrates' reaction to Phaedrus discussion of Lysias' speech is enthusiastic, hopeful to extend the teaching to the poor and old. Likewise, in the paragraph following the above, Nietzsche expresses the need to have experience with sights and sounds of suffering like poverty and sorrow.

* Chapter 5, paragraph 6 = section 235b. When Socrates disagrees with Phaedrus, so too does Nietzsche disagree with Schopenhauer.

I'll end here for now. Anyway, I'm still working it all out. I'd love to discuss this; I have much of ""BoT"" sketched out and can post more.

In fact, according to the data, only 74 out of 489 articles in the *Journal of Philosophy* cite other articles from that journal. Frankly, I can't believe that number. It's too low. 

Additionally, I find his choice of Journals interesting: were these 18 the most cited journals in *Mind*, *JP*, and *PR*? If so, that is disturbing.

I've just graduated from Oxford and I'm applying to do a philosophy PhD in the US. I've been asked to submit a 17-25 page writing sample for review. The only piece of work that I've written that's near this length is my thesis ('Does conceivability entail possibility?'), which is 40 pages long. 

However, I think that the first 25 pages of my thesis would work as a stand-alone extract which would deal with my argument for why conceivability entails possibility and would face a key criticism to the view, but would not include discussion on the proposed counter-examples to the conceivability principle.

None of my tutors are available to look at the sample, since I've now graduated. Would anyone mind taking a look? 



***My argument, roughly, is as follows:***


**P1.**     To conceive P is to modally imagine a situation which verifies P   (Chalmers' definition, basically).

**P2.**    There are no impossible situations: sentences which describe metaphysically impossible situations have no semantic value.

**P3.**     Since conceiving is an objectual mental activity (P1), we cannot conceive the impossible, since there's nothing to conceive.

i had no real post-graduate thoughts while doing my BA, and thus do not have any close relationship with professors i could call upon now, several years later, for recommendations, nor were my grades outside of my major spectacular. they were fine, but nothing amazing. i'm concerned that i'm going to find it hard to get into a Masters program with this mediocre application. 

so my question and summary is this: with a thoroughly generic if not underwhelming academic record to work with, what is my best bet for getting into a Masters program that will be put me on the path to teaching? should i go back and do a minor to improve my record and build relationships? or should i find any Masters program i can get into and then work up from there?

Thanks much for taking the time to read this somewhat rambling question. 

tl;dr - seeking advice on how to take a mediocre academic record and continue education with an eye towards teaching

&gt;But as Plato's dialogues explained it, what is oligarchy but the political stage following democracy.

This is incorrect, in the *Republic* Bk VIII 544ff. the descent of regimes is as follows:

* Aristocracy (rule of the excellent/virtuous)
* Timocracy (rule of the honourable)
* Oligarchy (rule of the wealthy)
* Democracy (rule of the many and their many unchecked desires)
* Tyranny (rule by the most licentious)

&gt;""The one that is praised by the many, the Cretan and Laconian regime [timocracy], and second in place and second in praise, the one called oligarchy, a regime filled with throngs of evils; and this regime’s adversary...democracy; and then the noble tyranny at last, excelling all these, the fourth and extreme illness of a city...Therefore if there are five arrangements of cities, there would also be five for the soul of private men...well, we have already described the man who is like the aristocracy, a man of whom we rightly assert that he is both good and just.""

Description of democracy (557):

&gt;""In the first place, aren’t they free? And isn’t the city full of freedom and free speech? And isn’t there license to do in it whatever one wants?...it’s plain that each man would organize his life in it privately just as it pleases him...[Which can be contrary to common good]...Then I suppose that in this regime especially, all sorts of human beings come to be...it is probably the fairest of the regimes...just like a many coloured cloak decorated in all hues, this regime, decorated with all dispositions, would also look fairest, and many perhaps...like boys and women looking at many-coloured things would judge this to be the fairest regime...in absence of any compulsion to rule in this city...or to make war...or to keep peace...the absence of any compulsion keeping you from ruling and being a judge anyhow, if you long to do so - isn’t such a way of passing the time divinely sweet for the moment?""

&gt;""How magnificently it tramples all this underfoot and doesn’t care at all from what kinds of practices man goes to political action, but honours him if only he says he’s well disposed toward the multitude.....and naming shame simplicity, they push it out with dishonour, a fugitive; calling moderation cowardliness and spattering it with mud they banish it; persuading that measure and orderly expenditure are rustic and illiberal, they join with many useless desires in driving them over the frontier...once they have emptied and purged these from the soul of the man whom they are seizing and initiating....they proceed to return insolence, anarchy, wastefulness, and shamelessness from exile in a blaze of light...extolling and flattering them by calling insolence good education; anarchy, freedom; wastefulness, magnificence; and shamelessness courage...that a man when he is young, changes from his rearing in necessary desire to the liberation and unleashing of unnecessary and useless pleasures?""

&gt;[563]""That a father...habituates himself to be like his child and fear his sons, and a son habituates himself to be like his father and to have no shame before or fear of his parents - that’s so he may be free...as the teacher in such a situation is frightened of the pupils and fawns on them, so the students make light of their teachers...and generally, the young copy their elders and compete with them in speeches and deeds while the old come down to the level of the young...so that they wont seem to be unpleasant or despotic.""

&gt;""Do you notice how tender they make the citizen’s soul, so that if someone proposes anything that smacks in anyway of slavery, they are irritated and can’t stand it? And they end up...by paying no attention to the laws, written or unwritten, in order that they may avoid having any master at all...this is the beginning, so fair and heady, from which tyranny in my opinion naturally grows...too much freedom seems to change into nothing but too much slavery, both for private man and city.""

I am an undergrad who is finishing up a seminar on Later Heidegger. I chose to write on The Question Concerning Technology for my final paper, and I chose to focus it on the role that the economy now plays in phenomenology. I have included the introduction to the (very) rough draft of my essay in this post (see below) to hopefully spark a discussion on this issue. If this goes against the rules of /r/AcademicPhilosophy, then I will gladly delete this post.

**Edit: If anybody wants a copy of the final version of the paper, please let me know**

 ...

&gt;It goes without saying that Heidegger thought of technology pejoratively. The technological thinking he bore witness to during his lifetime was perilous for mankind. Technology, in a broad sense, guided (and still guides, I believe) the revealing of our worlds to us, and in a way that infringes upon authenticity and thinking. I offer a continuation of Heidegger’s thinking in this essay: I want to argue that technology today has a new, more dangerous character compared to the way that Heidegger describes it. This argument should not be construed as critical, or in opposition to Heidegger’s thought- for starters, I am no historian, nor did I experience the world at the time Heidegger experienced it. Hence, I cannot pass judgment over whether or not Heidegger’s characterization of technology was true to his time. What I can do, however, is analyze technology today in relation to Heidegger’s characterization. As this task is a thinking through of the current day ultimately indebted to Heidegger, I will first present a short exegetical account of technology as he sees it, focused on how he thinks of enframing and the standing reserve. I will try to show that the ordering of resources that Heidegger believes happens in enframing is determined (in at least some sense) teleologically. I will argue that Heidegger thought ordering and orderability could still take on different characters depending on the realm they fall into, and contrast that with what I believe is now happening- all ordering is determined by economics, and resources are primarily economic resources. Ultimately, this is to show that technology is becoming more dangerous and obtrusive in this day and age – a revealing of economic resources through enframing not only provides evidence that man is already taking himself as standing-reserve (something I wish to argue in this paper as well), but also sets thinking upon a path that eventually eliminates realms for thinking to occur. I hope to show this final point through an analysis of recent economic developments and the computerization of profit-generation.

The Enlightenment period of philosophy brought us the notion that human history has been progressing towards an ultimate goal, that we can use reason to develop a more perfect society, that philosophy and science will eventually culminate in a consensus of truth.

Post-modernism, widely considered to be a reaction to this type of thinking, pulled the rug out from under our proverbial feet, claiming that there is no teleological end game, so to speak, and that this idea of history as a progression is a misconception. Instead, it's been suggested, by philosophers such as Lyotard and Derrida, that what we're dealing with is not so much a teleological synthesis of oppositions, as Marx believed, but a sort of amorphous web of interconnected points of view, within which the concept of ""progression,"" strictly speaking, as moving towards a shared end result or goal, does not make sense.

Along with this interpretation of history and progression, are there any implications for the ways we, as a society, can justify and legitimize our scientific pursuits?
Does giving up the Enlightenment notion of a teleological progression make the scientific community more vulnerable to anti-science rhetoric?

Here's how I understand it so far (and I'm really not sure if I'm understanding it right):

Davidson isn't satisfied with the compositional view that words have meanings which are then merged somehow into the new meaning of a sentence. He also says the mechanics by which sentences refer to a given ""state-of-affairs"" is murky. Yet languages must make accuracte statements, or else, as Davidson argues, they would not be learnable.

What Davidson suggests is that langauge evolves out of true statements. So, let's say I'm standing in a field of snow and I say ""Snow is white."" Let us further decide, arbitrarily, that this statement is ""true."" If this is the case, then whatever I say in the future about ""snow"" and ""white,"" assuming I wish to make true statements, must bear some relation to the true statement I made earlier. (I have a feeling this goes beyond what Davidson says in the paper...) Thus a language containing novel sentences can be formulated, given that ""snow is cold"" and ""snow is white,"" if they are to be true sentences, must bear some relation to one another.

This is how I've been making sense of it, but I know I'm not getting the whole picture. What I'm having trouble with is the role of Convention T. I understand that, in order to get rid of some troubling paradoxes, the ""true"" and ""false"" quantifies must exist only within a metalanguage. But what role can that serve in natural languages when we are discussing meaning? To my understanding, we line up two sentences, S is true if and only if p, where S is a statement in the object language and p is a statement in the metalanguage, which also contains the truth predicate. What's difficult for me is what this correspondence between languages is supposed to accomplish as far as meaning is concerned. Is is not simpler to say ""Let 'snow is white' be true."" and proceed from there?

I hope I've been clear enough with my problem. Any help?",,False,self,t5_2r7v0,False,,,True,t3_iwym6,http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/iwym6/can_somebody_help_me_get_a_handle_on_davidsons/,

Abstract. This paper criticizes two forms of philosophical materialism that adopt opposite strategies but end up in the same place. Both hold that individual entities must be banished from philosophy. The first kind is ground floor materialism, which attempts to dissolve all objects into some deeper underlying basis; here, objects are seen as too shallow to be the truth. The second kind is first floor materialism, which treats objects as naive fictions gullibly posited behind the direct accessibility of appearances or relations; here, objects are portrayed as too deep to be the truth. One major thesis of this paper is that these two forms of materialism are parasitical on one another and need each other’s resources to make sense of the world. The second major thesis is that both forms of materialism thereby stand condemned, and that philosophy must be rebuilt from the individual objects that the two forms of materialism disdain. These points are made through a detailed consideration of the book Every Thing Must Go by the analytic structural realists James Ladyman and Don Ross, which has gained a surprising following among some speculative realists in continental philosophy. Ladyman and Ross claim to preserve objects by treating them as “real patterns”, but they do so at the price of destroying their autonomous reality. Furthermore, they are unable to tell us whether the mathematical structures they see as the basis of human knowledge are also the basis of reality itself. In short, their ontology is scientism for scientism’s sake (or ‘Bunsen burner realism’) and must be eliminated in favor of a genuine realist metaphysics of objects.

1294353674.0,14,self.AcademicPhilosophy,exiyd,Requesting more primary and secondary sources (.pdf and Scribd welcome); some thoughts for those new to philosophy,17,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/exiyd/requesting_more_primary_and_secondary_sources_pdf/,"I. As for the first part of the title, I'll simply quote pyth:

&gt;Also, a lot of people on many reddits complain about Scribd or PDF links, whereas AcadPhil encourages those. People are encouraged to submit their favorite journal articles or philosophical books (I have uploaded a few PDFs of articles I have enjoyed over the years)."" - from http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/allao/just_curious_what_are_the_philosophy_related/c0i866l

I'm not complaining about what everyone is submitting. I enjoy what you're posting. I'm envious of many of the links you find. But there are several virtues to reposting links to things like Russell's ""The Problems of Philosophy"" (which tends to show up every so often on the philosophical reddits). First, the conversation that can occur around such texts, which is hopefully helpful to people currently studying. Second, if I had known about Russell's ""The Problems of Philosophy"" when an undergrad, it would have helped greatly. Classes sometimes have a knack for keeping one away from the texts that make things clearer.

II. I know a few of you are brand new to philosophy. You've subscribed to this subreddit hoping for some kind of introduction. Occasionally you speak up and get a bunch of recommendations, all of which are useful, but are definitely a bit hard to take in all at once.

I'll let the commentariat destroy what I'm about to say, but roughly the study of philosophy nowadays is divided into analytic and continental camps. Analytic deals with things such as logic, strong AI vs. weak AI, epistemology (theory of knowledge, nowadays ""first philosophy""), how language works, philosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics, and a bunch of other topics. An example of continental philosophy is the work of Heidegger, who in ""Introduction to Metaphyics"" asks ""why are their beings at all instead of Nothing?""

Most of what you see in the academy is analytic philosophy, and the issues there start simple and become very complex very quickly. For example, back in epistemology class, we read G.E. Moore's ""Proof of an External World,"" an essay by Ayer defending knowledge as true, justified belief, and the essay by Gettier in which he showed how ""justified"" can become a serious problem for defining knowledge as true, justified belief. All of that I could understand. It was the hundred or so other essays making claims about probability, the nature of counterfactuals, contextualism, etc. responding to Gettier that got out of hand for me.

I'm telling you this story so you understand what you're getting on Reddit. It's a range of links, some meant for experts, some for beginners. Many times they're from different subfields that require prior knowledge just to understand their relevance. 

So you need two things if you're new to all of this: 

1) the ability to get background knowledge to ""fill in gaps"" before and during reading. This has been made considerably simpler by things like Wikipedia. My own recommendation is that you should find a cheap copy of Oxford's ""Philosophy 1"" (ed. Grayling). It doesn't get into how complex some of the contemporary debate gets. But that complexity is something you're always going to be confronting, since philosophy is actively being done on the Internet as we speak.

2) Familiarity with some more basic, easier texts. A while ago I was asked what was so great about Sartre's ""Existentialism Is a Humanism."" Well, if you're new to all of this, starting with the Euthyphro or Either/Or is a good way to go crazy fast. The idea here is that while ""getting started,"" you're getting your reading skills in shape. Reading philosophy is hard. As most readers of my blog know, I still can't get things right half the time, and I've been doing this for years. The texts I recommend if you're brand new to philosophy:

*Sartre, ""Existentialism Is a Humanism:"" http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm

*Nietzsche, ""The Case of Wagner:"" http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25012

*Russell, ""The Problems of Philosophy:"" http://www.ditext.com/russell/russell.html

*Marx and Engels, ""The Communist Manifesto:"" http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm

*Karl Popper, ""Science: Conjectures and Refutations:"" http://cla.calpoly.edu/~fotoole/321.1/popper.html

Again, those are just to get started. One doesn't become an expert on Wittgenstein or Xenophon by reading those. One doesn't even get the clarity one needs on a subfield - you still need to read about Hegelian idealism or the problem of induction quite a bit more. But trust me, you'll feel awesome if you get a grip on any of those. Reading philosophy well is hard, but the payoff is huge. You get more out of what you read generally. I'm sure you'll get plenty of recommendations in the comments like the ones above.

If you've made it this far, thank you for your time, and thank you so much for your support of academic philosophy. If you're new to this stuff, please don't get frustrated with how things look on reddit sometimes. The whole point of this place is the community. We're here to help. Please do spread the word about this subreddit.

&gt; The thinking Arendt demands requires pride, a feeling of difference between oneself and others—even a kind of arrogance, an arrogance that von Trotta seizes on screen. The film honestly addresses this characteristic of Arendt and of thinking itself, and does not shirk from Arendt’s belief that a confidence in one’s own distinctiveness is necessary for character. **Like Emerson’s, Arendt’s writing celebrates self-reliance.** For her, our democratic desire for equality—to be the same as others and to not judge them—compounds the problem of thoughtlessness. [source](http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2013/05/30/lonely-thinking-hannah-arendt-on-film/) (my emphasis)

I did a cursory search online, looking for others who make the claim that Arendt was Emersonian. I found very few people speaking about the idea, but again Roger Berkowitz makes the claim in a paper titled ""Solitude and the Activity of Thinking,"" an essay for the anthology *Thinking in Dark Times.* In this paper, Berkowitz states:
&gt; There may be no thinker in the canon of political thinking more attuned to the political relevance of the dignity of the solitary thinker than Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emersonian self reliance is possessed by those who follow the inflexible string that colloquially is called one’s backbone. Trust thyself, Emerson counsels, and hear that iron string that every hearts vibrates to. As Emerson writes: “He only who is able to stand alone is qualified for society.”35 Emerson’s imperative, to take up the divine idea allotted to each one of us, resonates with Arendt’s Socratic
imperative, to be true to yourself. Are Emerson and Arendt fooling themselves? 
Are we truly to believe that thinking in solitude can be the animating source of politics? [source](http://academia.edu/418952/Solitude_and_the_Activity_of_Thinking)

I am: a) hoping to focus on some of his more recent work, and b) hoping not to get bogged down with difficulties that have already been solved. Therefore, I was hoping to educate myself on the very recent discourse surrounding Derrida.

How is he being discussed and applied at the moment? I'm not particularly interested in writing a paper about Derrida and literature (as I like to put Derrida and philosophy in one box and literature in another), so criticism on Derrida the ~~philosopher~~ would be the most pertinent to my forthcoming project. My general plan is to spend the summer reading as much of his work and the surrounding criticism as I can to form a good base as well as a good question to address in the fall. Anything from well thought out polemics (not just ""waaaaaaaaah, Derrida is hard to read and doesn't make sense"") to applications in ethics would be helpful!

He gives the example of mathematics and cause and effect, but of course doesn't clearly explain how they are actually pure and not just normal a priori (at least it's not clear at all to me). My real problem lays in how can he, or anyone, account for thought ever occurring without some sort of experience first? How can thought ever occur without being linked to some form of experience?

So here's my situation: my bachelors degree (graduating in April) is going to be in Literature and History; however, a few months ago, I decided that I want to pursue Philosophy in grad school, my ""passion."" The reason why I didn't get my undergraduate degree in Philosophy is that my university, being small, didn't offer it. 

In preparation, however, I have been vigorously studying Philosophy for about 2 months now, soaking up everything I possibly can. All of this study has been done in the spare time around my class schedule. But this self-education (if you will) has definitely led me to some preferences, particularly the continental Philosophers. I took up a pretty big interest in Marxism (and all of the branches, such as the Frankfurt School), and also an interest in the Phenomenology of Heidegger. I've actually been considering doing a research paper on a (late) Heideggerian reading of Marxism as a writing sample for applications. 

Also, another thing working against me is that my first year and a half of school showed pretty poor performance. However, from my fourth semester onward, I only got As and Bs, and have gotten Straight As the past two semesters. Unfortunately, though, because of the first year and a half, my collective GPA will probably only be about a 3.4. 

So, do any of you think I will have a chance at getting into a decent Philosophy program at a competitive school (Loyola, Penn State, et cet)? Is there anyway to show in the application process that I have independently studied the history of philosophy, or is it all going to come down to my writing sample? 

**Edit: I just wanted to say I sincerely appreciate the input. Though it's clear to me now that it will be an uphill battle, all of the comments have been a big motivation. At least I have a really good understanding of all my options. All in all, I think I will focus on getting into a good Masters program. I currently have one professor who has offered me reading lists and help in order to help me prepare a writing sample (his background is in continental philosophy), so I think I'll probably focus on doing good on the GREs and turning out the best possible writing sample/research paper I can reasonably pull off.**",,False,self,t5_2r7v0,True,,,True,t3_d72jd,http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/d72jd/what_are_my_chances_of_getting_into_a_graduate/,

Obviously the next step is to apply to Master's programs, but I'm taking a bit of a sabbatical by living in a foreign country for a while.

How would you recommend I prepare?  I will be reading through Copleston's History of Philosophy and will be trying to search out blogs and podcasts, including the links on the sidebar.

Any other specific books or journals I should start reading?  Should I even try writing?  Where would I be able to submit articles I write, if anywhere?

I think a word needs to be said in defense of Plato. When I was an undergrad, it was very easy to want to read every essay about whether Wittgenstein's considerations on mathematics led to a type of ethics, or fight with a paper about the ""surprise quiz"" paradox, or read about experiments in linguistics and wonder about cog sci related stuff.

I was sitting at my desk, pondering how to approach my next philosophy paper and thought I'd check to see if 'there's a subreddit for that.'  Turns out that, of course, there is.  I'm quite happy to have found you all.

In a little under a month I have a 5000 word, masters level paper due for a Modernist Literature class.  I'm a Philosophy and Literature major, so I've decided to take a philosophical look at the concept of hope in the writings of Kafka.  I'll be focusing on The Trial and probably The Castle as well, and will be looking to Camus (The Myth of Sisyphus) and Sartre for some additional reading.  

I want to explore the existentialist idea of hope and how this is addressed in Kafka's writings (if at all).  Our general notion of hope is heavily influenced by religious culture, past and present.  It has associations with time (the future), meaning, and expectation.  If you look at this notion of hope in the light of existential philosophy, you're faced with a rather interesting situation. For most existentialists there is no God, no afterlife, thus life has no meaning in and of itself -- the assignment of meaning is left up to the individual.   When faced with this realization, life (as Camus would say) becomes absurd.  The existentialist notion of time is also different.  The present moment is the only time which can be affected, so the idea of 'hope for the future' is nothing but an illusion.

These are just some of my preliminary thoughts, and they are rather scattered.  Basically I need to get a working definition of what the existentialist notion of hope actually is and examine how it applies to/is explored by Kafka in his writings.

What do you think hope is for an existentialist?
What further readings would you suggest?
What are your thoughts on the idea of hope in the face of a meaningless existence?

[EDIT]  I just wanted to thank everyone for your thoughts.  You have given me some excellent ideas to pursue.

As a sort of utilitarian, he uses numerical criterion to justify particular topics as being particularly important.

A similar argument was made by [Nick Bostrom](http://www.nickbostrom.com/old/predict.html) about various statistical/epistemological concerns for futorology and existential risks.

But in neither case did they consider how likely one's research is to make any difference - so they're missing half of any expected-value calculation.

Has any philosopher made a habit of picking research topics by their expected-value contribution, and laid out his reasoning?

I figured Academic fill would be a good place to ask this since some of you may have peers and friends that decided to stop at the MA.

It denies that anything like Fregean senses are part of the meaning of proper names. It is held by thinkers like Nathan Salmon, Scott Soames, and others, and it is strongly influenced by Kripke, although Kripke does not openly endorse it.

Millianism is widely held to be implausible because it holds that (1) and (2) express the same proposition, and thus have the same truth conditions:

(1) Lois Lane believes that Superman can fly.

(2) Lois Lane believes that Clark Kent can fly.

Since everyone knows that Lois might believe that Superman can fly while disbelieving that Clark Kent can fly, it seems that (1) and (2) cannot express the same proposition.

I hold a Millian theory of proper names, but I do not know many people who share my view. My view is something like Nathan Salmon's in *Frege's Puzzle*, but with a different pragmatic explanation of substitution failure.

Does anyone else support Millianism? Or is it completely implausible? I am just curious to get a ""temp check"" on this forum.",,False,self,t5_2r7v0,False,,,True,t3_m72mb,http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/m72mb/does_anyone_believe_in_millianism_as_a_theory_of/,

&gt;Ad 1.    Postdoc Stipend in Theoretical Philosophy

&gt;At the section II of the Philosophy Department of the Ruhr-Universität Bochum a postdoc-grant is offered starting at 1st December 2010 in the research unit of Prof. Dr. Albert Newen focusing on one area in theoretical philosophy that complements the ongoing research projects under his supervision. This position is open for developing a new research topic in systematic theoretical philosophy. The ideal candidate offers primarily a proposal that is complementary but has some connections to one of the ongoing projects.
The ongoing research projects are:
-    Knowing-how and Knowing-that/ Natural foundation of cognitive abilities
-    Other Minds. Neurophilosophy and Neuroethics of Intersubjectivity
-    Social Information Processing and Culture
-    Philosophy of Language, Mind and Science: Concepts, Supervenience, Reductionism, Agency and Ownership, Ontology of the Mind
-    Animal Minds and Rationality

&gt;The common methodology of the projects is interdisciplinary, combining philosophical, psychological and neurobiological approaches. The projects are realized in cooperation with the universities Köln, Bonn and Hamburg as well as a team from Finland. The postdoc should be open for cooperation with colleagues of different subjects and from different universities while the research project can be a clear complementary research dimension.
&gt;To develop our research unit in Bochum we invite applications for a postdoctoral grant (stipend: 2.500 Euro per month) starting on the 1st of December 2010. This post is available for a period of two years (with an optional extension).
&gt;Profile of the Postdoc position:
&gt;Applicants should hold an outstanding Ph.D. in Philosophy and ideally, also a degree in Psychology, Cognitive Science, Medicine or Neuroscience. Substantial expertise in at least one of these areas is required. The selected person will participate in the supervision of one of the ongoing projects and work with doctoral students. There will remain a lot of freedom to develop one’s own research project in systematic theoretic philosophy. Furthermore the position is open for a qualification called “Habilitation” in the German university system.
&gt;Teaching
&gt;The postdoc grant is a pure research position with no teaching duty. Nevertheless, it is expected that the person offers one course per academic year closely related to the research project. The course can be delivered in English or German.
&gt;Language
&gt;The applicant need not speak German at the time of application, but should be willing to learn some conversational German.

&gt;Applications (in English or German) are due by 10th of October 2010 and should include:
1. A brief letter of application that addresses, among other things, one’s academic background and research interests;
2.    A proposal for a research project of 2 pages
3.    Curriculum vitae including a list of publications, talks, conferences attended and teaching experience
4.    Copies of all certificates
5.    Please attach exactly one (!) article

&gt;One confidential letters of recommendation addressing the applicant’s qualifications for an outstanding postdoc research. This should be sent from the referee directly or from a letter service. All documents of the candidate should be send electronically. We do not resend any material.

&gt;Applications, as well as any questions, should be directed to:

1280073072.0,13,self.AcademicPhilosophy,cti7y,Literature as philosophy.,16,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/cti7y/literature_as_philosophy/,"**edit**: Originally meant for this to go to /r/philosophy, or I would have actually written up something smarter and less rant-y for /r/ap, but forgot to change it. I'll leave it here though, and resubmit, because I'm sure to get more intelligent feedback here.

So, that [Borges interview](http://denisdutton.com/jorge_luis_borges_interview.htm) [1] posted here the other day got me thinking about literature as philosophy. I've always rather enjoyed speculative fiction specifically because it is a way to explore philosophical ideas concretely as opposed to in the abstract. ""What do I think this philosophy implies?"", etc. Usula K. Le Guin talks about this well in her introduction to _The Left Hand of Darkness_ [2], available [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=ksOjjuy3issC&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;ots=IjrU_9grqz&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), which details how she views literature as a way of telling lies to get at truths.

And so now I'm curious, what works of fiction strike you as being as much about philosophy as about a story? The stuff that comes most easily to mind to me is SF that I've read, but I'm sure there is much more. Novels like [Blindsight](http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm) by Peter Watts and _Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom_ by Doctorow deal with issues in philosophy of mind and identity (_Blindsight_ is particularly good). _Left Hand of Darkness_ by Ursula K. Le Guin addresses issues of gender and relationships. Borges talks about Idealism, ontology, and epistemology. Iain M. Banks' Culture novels deal with political philosophy, especially regarding war and colonialism and whether man must be governed.

Then you also have the French existentialists, particularly Camus and Satre. _The Stranger_, _No Exit_, etc., deal with how man deals living in a meaningless world. Kierkegaard also did this with _Either/Or_, although I haven't read it so can't comment.

Then I suppose you can also include novels such as Daniel Quinn's _Ishmael_ or Douglas Adam's _God's Debris_, but beyond these being fairly simplistic philosophies, they also fall under Borges' descriptions of parable rather than literature, and I want to get at something distinct.

Anyway, I was hoping that this might be a jumping off point for some fun discussion about the role of literature in philosophy, and that I might get a few good recommendations for literature that deals particularly deftly with an aspect of philosophy.

&gt; DD: Do you think that it is possible then for a story to represent a philosophical position more effectively than a philosopher can argue for it?

&gt; Borges: I have never thought of that, but I suppose you’re right, Sir. I suppose you — yes, yes, I think you’re right. Because as — I don’t know who said that, was it Bernard Shaw? — he said, arguments convince nobody. No, Emerson. He said, arguments convince nobody. And I suppose he was right, even if you think of proofs for the existence of God, for example — no? In that case, if arguments convince nobody, a man may be convinced by parables or fables or what? Or fictions. Those are far more convincing than the syllogism — and they are, I suppose. Well, of course, when I think of something in terms of Jesus Christ. As far as I remember, he never used arguments; he used style, he used certain metaphors. It’s very strange — yes, and he always used very striking sentences. He would not say, I don’t come to bring peace but war — “I do not come to bring peace but a sword.” The Christ, he thought in parables. Well, according to — I think that it was Blake who said that a man should be — I mean, if he is a Christian — should be not only just but he should be intelligent ... he should also be an artist, since Christ had been teaching art through his own way of preaching, because every one of the sentences of Christ, if not every single utterance of Christ, has a literary value, and may be thought of as a metaphor or as a parable.

&gt; Fiction writers, at least in their braver moments, do desire to know the truth: to know it, speak it, serve it. But they go about this in a peculiar and devious way, which consists in inventing persons, places, and events which never did and never will exist or occur, and telling about these fictions in detail and at length and with a great deal of emotion, and when they are done writing down this pack of lies they say, There!

We are a small group of undergraduate students who have been busy organizing a bilingual conference on aesthetics, to be held at the University of Ottawa on the 19th and 20th of February 2014. Currently, Noël Carroll and Daniel Dumouchel have accepted our invitations and we are seeking papers from graduate students and professors.

Links to our call for papers may be found here:

* [English](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0vatHnwv3U9WW1vWWlsR0oyTlE/edit?usp=sharing)

* [French](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0vatHnwv3U9dTZQV2dGNnBnVjQ/edit?usp=sharing) 
 
Following is a pasted copy of our English call for papers. And, if you have any questions, leave a comment!

----------------------------------------------------

Keynote Speakers:

Noël Carroll, City University of New York

Daniel Dumouchel, Université de Montréal

The theme of the conference is aesthetic experience, as manifested in our interaction with works of art and our environment. Papers may fall under either a theoretical approach or a historical approach. Theoretical papers should directly address questions relating to the theme of the conference, including but not limited to:

*	Why do we experience some objects as beautiful and others not?

*	What separates aesthetic experiences from meaningful everyday experiences? Is there a distinction between the two?

*	What is the role and relation of emotions to aesthetic experiences?

*	What is the relation between the aesthetic experience and works of art? Is it necessary or contingent for works of art to provide an aesthetic experience?

*	How does this experience change us, and what can we learn from it?

*	How can this experience be explained psychologically, biologically, linguistically, or socially?

Historical papers should explicate what previous thinkers, be they philosophers, psychologists, or art critics, have held regarding this topic.


Papers both in English and French language are accepted. This bilingual conference encourages academic papers from different disciplines, including music, visual arts, literature, film studies, psychology, and philosophy. Professors and graduate students are requested to submit only a title and a 100-word abstract of the paper in .doc, .docx, .rtf, or .pdf format. The papers should be approximately 3500 words.

The submission deadline is Tuesday, December 10, 2013. Submissions should be directed to submission.oac2014@gmail.com
 
If there are any general questions concerning the conference, please direct them to question.oac2014@gmail.com.

The argument starts on page 18 and ends on page 23. 

I think I disagree with his third premise: Facts about bare difference cannot entail facts about qualitative content. 

He tries to use an example about orange being a pattern of bare difference between red and yellow, but if you apply the same pattern of bare difference using blue and green, you do not see orange. I think this example is flawed, because the relevant pattern of bare difference necessary to entail orange doesn't reside in patterns of bare difference about photons, but rather patterns of bare differences about which neurons get activated. Simply, the patterns of bare difference of blue and green do not generate orange because they do not activate the same parts of the brain as the red and yellow photons when arranged in that pattern.

I'm hoping to get into a Ph.D. program for philosophy (applying to schools that are good for philosophy of religion, i.e., Boston College, Loyola, Notre Dame, UNC Chapel Hill).  I took the GRE this week and did phenomenally on the Verbal Reasoning (750-800).  I was less impressive on the Quantitative reasoning (450 - 550).  I have no idea yet how the Analytic section went, but for the sake of this question, let's assume I did well.

Despite the great Verbal score, that Quantitative is going to make my composite look pretty terrible.  I've been told by a prof in undergraduate philosophy that grad programs in philosophy ""generally"" only look at Verbal/Analytic, so I should be okay.  But she's really not sure, and as anyone would have to grant, it's competitive to a ridiculous extent.  Most schools claim they have no cut-off score for the GRE...but I imagine most do.  I don't want to be swept off the pile before anyone even has a chance to see how my scores break down, or what my reference letters/writing sample look like.

So to make a long question short:  Should I go through the stress/expense of retaking the GRE in the hopes of a higher composite, or will I be wasting my time, since philosophy programs only glance at quantitative scores anyway?

Sometimes I feel like I'm top-ten material; other times, I feel like I'd be lucky to get into a top-forty. Is it inappropriate to ask current/former graduate students to share the writing sample that they used with their application?

I know there's a lot of graduate-school-application-related posts floating around this subreddit, so I apologize if this is annoying for the more experienced of you. From the perspective of a soon-to-be applicant, I can say that having access to this community is remarkably valuable, and appreciated. I'm sure you all remember what a terrifying moment in one's philosophical career this is.

Anyway, TL;DR version:

* The aforelinked blog is rather entertaining.
* Anyone have any other blogs they'd like to share?
* Generally, any advice on graduate applications would be appreciated.
* Specifically, any advice on determining the caliber of programs to which I have a chance of being accepted would be appreciated.

Thank you!

I wish I could recall what it was, I am pretty sure it was some content posted here at AP...

But I digress, I admit I haven't really read any of these yet, nor have I read the *Poetics*, so this is an aspirational - rather than an instructional - post. Nonetheless, it's a useful contrast, I believe, to look at some of the ideas regarding poetry and art of the classical times in order to have them lie in relief against our own pervasive beliefs about those same concepts. I hope someone here can benefit from these bare beginnings of research on the classic text about poetry and drama.

Here's a collection of places to start; many recently posted here at AP, with cool new additions:

* **[Observations on the Reception of the Aristotelian Poetics in the Latin West](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/dik3j/observations_on_the_reception_of_the_aristotelian/)** # E. N. Tigerstedt # Studies in the Renaissance Vol. 15, (1968), pp. 7-24 (Now Free thanks to gasolinerefugee!)
* **[[IEP] Aristotle: Poetics](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/dfq65/iep_aristotle_poetics_the_first_scandal_in_the/)** - The first scandal in the Poetics is the initial marking out of dramatic poetry as a form of imitation. We call the poet a creator, and are offended at the suggestion that he might be merely some sort of recording device.
* **[Myth, memory, and history ~ Moses I. Finley (1965)](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/dfq3r/myth_memory_and_history_moses_i_finley_1965/)** - Aristotle's Poetics, ""Poetry is more philosophical and more weighty than history, for poetry speaks rather of the universal, history the particular."" [If you are not aware, M. I. Finley is a very influential and gifted scholar of the recently passed generation of intellectuals, his works is well worth consulting.]
* **[These materials are designed to support the module on Aristotle's Poetics](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/classics/resources/poetics/index.htm)** (CLAS3152: Further Greek Literature II) - Which includes a modified version of the [full text of the S.H.

Radford’s paradox is based on three premises which he claim to all be true. The first is that for one to have an emotional response to a story one must believe that that story actually exists or has existed. The second premise is that such beliefs are often lacking when we read stories, and the third is that we clearly have emotional responses to works of fiction. Because these premises contradict each other Radford*

Nöel Carroll's book *The Philosophy of horror, or, Paradoxes of the heart* is also a good introduction to the problem.
---
I wrote a paper on this problem last year, with an emphasis on evil in film. More specifically, how the horror film, a genre filled with violence, murder and other portrayals of evil, can be so vastly popular. Why do we seek out fiction which we, when confronted with in the real world, would try to avoid at all costs. My conclusions ended up circling around *perversion* and voyeurism, but I was never satisfied with my own conclusions. Has anyone else here done any work regarding this paradox? 

*I will try to elaborate once I get home from work, and can dig up my old paper. I must warn you that English is not my first language, but I hope I can make myself understood. Also, I'm surprised to see so many responses! This post was just a little probing of AcademicPhilosophy, to see whether you would be interested in discussions around the arts.

- **want-modification.** Specifically the societal implications if we could mold our desires at whim. Ex: some people have a hard time *wanting* to go to work, or to work out, or eat a certain kind of food to lose weight; the ability to modify that on a whim would be huge, but has anyone written about it?

- **moral logicism/rationalism.** This is probably a bad term; I'm not sure what to call it or if it has a formal academic name. The idea that you should value methodology that helps you think clearly, reach true conclusions, and remain unbiased (not just that these methodology exist) and adhering to them is a morally good thing to do because it helps you be more truthful/unbiased. This sort of mindset is common in skeptic circles, but I don't know if ""skepticism"" is a good term for it.

- **Genetic arms race.** This is probably more in the realm of game theory: the implications if one nation were to develop genetic manipulation technology (either advanced eugenics or some kind of direct manipulation technology) before every other. Most seem to focus on how this would stratify society economically, but I am more interested in other perspectives.

1293981744.0,9,self.AcademicPhilosophy,euy9b,Fine tuning? (A question from a confused layman),12,3,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/euy9b/fine_tuning_a_question_from_a_confused_layman/,"Essentially my question is this: Why is the idea of a fine tuned universe taken seriously by modern scientists and philosophers?  Why does the now-cliche ['shuffled cards'](http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=Anthropic_principle#False_premise_p1:_Frames_of_reference) example not apply?  

Here is the background to my question:
I have a religious background that leans towards the fundamentalist end of christianity.  I rejected my faith a few years ago after examining my beliefs and finding nothing that stood up to simple critical thinking.  At the time one of the arguments in favour of creationism which had been drilled into me through the years was fine tuning.  The idea being that when examined, the universe turns out to have certain physical constants seemingly precisely tuned for life.  After thinking more carefully about this in a more skeptical light, I decided that the argument had no merit, and was a result of seeing human life as more special than it really is (or more 'statistically significant').  I figured that a life-supporting universe was just one of an unthinkable number of ways the universe could have turned out, and marvelling at the fact that the nature of the universe seems to have worked out pretty well for us makes no sense, because there is no reason to think that this particular configuration of the universe or life itself is somehow special.  I actually considered fine tuning to be one of the weaker arguments I had been taught.

Then, a couple of years ago I started attending university and became fairly interested in philosophy.  I didn't choose it as my major, but I took a couple of 100 level classes and went to 3 or 4 philosophy events where there were more advanced lectures (of which about half I could follow).  I was shocked to find that the idea of fine tuning was taken quite seriously among philosophers.  After reading everything on the matter that is on the intellectual level of a mere layman, I still have no idea why this idea is seen to have merit, or why people feel the need to invoke ideas like multiple universes to deal with the problem.  Everyone seems to be seeing some sort of inconsistency where I see none.

Thank you in advance for your time :) this problem has been a very irritating itch in the back of my mind for some time and I very much appreciate any help.  I hope I have been clear and have avoided saying anything too stupid.

EDIT: I just found [this article](http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/tuning-revisited.html) which does a very good job of summarising what I see as the problems with the fine tuning argument.  The one of most interest to me is number 4.

EDIT#2: ignatiusloyola has made me aware that there could be confusion among theoretical physicists over the related but distinct term [""Fine Tuning""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning).  This thread is about the other type of fine tuning, AKA [The Fine Tuned Universe Argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_Universe).
